OU6hne92aa	NOTHING defeats God.   were talking:  zero.  zip.  zilch.  nada.|`|3b592d2cb161619b043cacf776619609aa	Size is just a part of the illusion.         This is more easily understandable if one considers the actual structure of an atom and the scale and placement of its components.  If one takes into account the fact that the neutrons and protons form a dense cluster at the center of the atom and that the electrons orbit in such a way that huge spaces exist between them and the nucleus it becomes clear that the atoms that make up seemingly solid objects are made up of 99+ percent empty space at any given moment.    This alone does not seem too important until you add the idea that the atoms that make up many seemingly solid objects are more of a loose conglomeration that share a similar attraction but never really touch each other.    At first glance this does not really seem relevant, but closer analysis reveals that this adds a tremendous amount of empty space to solid objects that are already made up of atoms that could be thought of as 99 percent space. When so-called solid objects are seen in this light it becomes apparent that may not be the seemingly solid objects they appear to us to be.    We ourselves are not exceptions to this phenomenon.    These seemingly solid objects are more like ghostly images that we interpret as solid objects based on our perceptual conclusions.     From this one could conclude that Perception is some sort of a trick that helps us to take these ghostly images and turns them into a world we can associate and interact with. This clever device seems to be a creation of our intellect that enables us to interact with each other in what appears to be a three dimensional reality.    I want to add that this is based on my own personal way of looking at the situation and was never intended to be a physics lesson.

So,since all rational theories(philosophical,scientific and logical) implying that there must be a god...the logical interpretation is that god is the existence it self...it is the whole universe (with what it contain)  ...you can't know how god is formed or created or even how does he affect things and recognize it...because he is the creation it self and that you can't be able to imagine the whole issue...since if our brains aren't able to imagine our existence in more than 3 dimensional world..how come we are able to perceive the whole issue!    so god isn't a limited mass that travel through the universe..it is the creation and the universe it self!|`|MCJAYZeZaa	Maybe God would run instead of walk. The idea that God is unfathomable is something that is widely accepted by those who choose to believe in God, but in order to deal with the problem of managing the universe as a whole God would have to be everywhere at once. If God is everywhere then God may travel in an instant to wherever God may need or desire to be. However the fact that you don't seem to feel that one would not care about every aspect of their creation, especially when that creation resulted in intelligent thought and that thought spawned its own creations is somewhat insulting. People who create things are very particular over what occurs in their own creating, no matter how small and 'seemingly' insignificant that section of creation is. Even assuming that mankind and the planet it inhabits is insignificant, they are surely valuable as some part of the whole creation. For if they were not there then the creation itself would be different from what their is.   As for caring about our individual problems I doubt that God really cares about our problems in the here and now. I lack the arrogance to believe that my small concerns over if I'm going to win the lottery this week really matters in the grand scheme of things, much less in God's mind.  If our life is like a parade and while we are in the parade we can only see what is directly in front of us, then maybe we would be worried that some things are necessary in order for the continuation of our own ways of life. God, on the other hand, is like someone flying over the parade route in a plane, able to see where the parade will eventually arrive. Therefore God has no worries for what we are worried about in the here and now because God knows what awaits and how we will get through the lives that we live.|`|V60mZea1aa	When they created a "god",  people did not know that there was more than just a flat earth, otherwise they would have had to give up on a concept such as the existence of "god".

That seems to be the argument.    That argument is flawed in that it does not account for the possibility where God could have created an automated system.  Such system would be conscious enough to manage itself and so individual wishes and desires would be taken care of by their own conscious activities.    This of course begs the question whether such a system could be created, but the question assumed that God had created the system already.    The real questions should be whether such a system could have emerged naturally without God creating it, and more importantly whether there was God to begin with.    Logic of a statement could not be validated if the axioms are not established.    If the axioms are assumed, logic would verify what possibilities those axioms yield - even if the axioms and the statements are wrong.|`|4f8d10b8e9f463f7b66f637cae452500aa	Whatever may be the size of the Cosmos, it is filled with gravitational and electromagnetic fields, space and time.

AA12343309	If you want to just find out your regional/ethnic background, don't waste your money on a company that  uses Y & Mitochondrial only. Both are g ood for someone who is involved in family history as they go back in a striaght line virtually unchanged.  People use both tests to match themselves with other family trees.  They  will assign you to a Haplogroup based on your DNA and show you the origin of your nomadic ancestors going back thousands of years.    They advertise that they will help you discover your "deep ancestral roots."  However, they are for 2 lines only.  Y goes from father to son only.  Mitochondrial goes from mother to both sons and daughters but only the daughters pass it on to their children.  You come from a myriad of family lines.  Right off the bat both of them will exclude your maternal grandfather and your maternal grandmother.    If you get back to your 6xgreat grandparents, you are directly descended from 510 individuals.  Your ancestry pyramids as you go  back.    Of those 510, you get your Y DNA from only 8 and your Mitochondrial from only 8 leaving out 494 people.  The only way these numbers can be a little different is ifsome of your ancestors going back that far were distant cousins of varying degree.    You get 23 chromosones each from both parents and they are made up of DNA.  Only one of those chromosones has your Y & Mitochondrial which is the DNA for that determines your sex.  The rest has your Autosomal DNA. which is really your genetic profile.    There is one company that will take your Autosomal DNA and match you with population groups throughout the world.   That is    http://www.DNAtribes.com    When you go into their website  if you go under "Feedback" there is a way you can email them and ask questions.    They aren't going to tell you that you are 1/2 of something, 1/4 of something else and 1/4 of another something else.  What they will do is give you your top 20 matches.  You have to undestand the same DNA crosses national, racial and ethnic boundaries.      Now I found a website that says you do not get your Autosomal 50-50 from both parents so I asked a question on the biology board about this and was give this reply.    "Actually, you do inherit your autosomal DNA 50-50 from each parent. That site is wrong.    Your mother's egg contributes one set of 22 autosomes and one sex chromosome (an X). Your father's sperm contributes the other set of 22 autosomes, and another sex chromosome (either an X or a Y).    Where the 50-50 part breaks down is when you pass on your DNA to your children. Each of your children will get half their DNA from you, but they won't necessarily get an equal mix of what you inherited from your parents. They could inherit a more from your mother, through you, and less from your father, or vice versa.    Another way to look at it: you inherited 50% of your autosomal DNA from each parent, but you didn't necessarily inherit exactly 25% from each grandparent. Your maternal grandparents contributed exactly 50% in total, but it could be biased in favor of either your maternal grandmother or your maternal grandfather. Same goes for your paternal grandparents.      When you take one of those DNA tests, which markers they find depend on which ones you inherited through your mother and father, and that will be different between you and your siblings (assuming no identical twins). If one of your grandparents is Dutch, and another is Polish, you might happen to inherit more markers that the test considers NW Eur., and your sister might happen to inherit more that are considered E Eur. In most cases, that will just be a random chance. Also, just because you have more markers that the test considers NW Eur, doesn't necessarily mean you really are "more" NW Eur. in any real sense."  This answer came from a PHD in molecular biology.    I had asked DNATribes if my sister with whom I share both parents had the same Autosomal test done and they replied:    "Two siblings will each obtain unique results. Family members do typically share some regional or ethnic genetic affiliations, but in some cases matches can vary substantially between siblings."    So don't use National Geographic, Ancestry.Com or even FamilyTreeDNA. FamilyTreeDNA does do Autosomal testing but they won't give you any type of analysis.  I had to take my results from FamilyTreeDNA and send them to DNATribes.  I think at one time they did do analysis.     Some of them want to spin you.  One told me the only reason a person would want the Autosomal tested is if they are biracial which means Caucasian and non Caucasian. They are full of bull corn.  There were a lot of people from different European backgrounds in colonial America.  Most of the descendants of those  people have really lost track of where all their ancestors came from as not all came from England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.  They just know they are American but they are curious about their origins.|`|FOTanZ3Faa	Ancestry is supposed to be fairly reliable, but one word of advice - make sure you read up what you get in terms of results. The cheaper tests will come back with vaguer results. The more you pay, the more markers they test, meaning you get a more in-depth result.    You can also get different types of test. One test, the Y-chromosome test, looks at your paternal line (only males can take this test, so if you were a woman, you would have to ask a father or a brother to take it for you), and another, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) test, looks at the genes passed down from mother to child. Both sons and daughters inherit their mothers genes in this case, but the males can't pass it on to their children, which is why it's a test that only tells you about the females in your line(both males and females can take this test).    It sounds like you're onto the right thing here, though the test might not be able to tell if you're German, for example, but simply " North European". You would have to look further into the details to see what results they would give you; and remember that they can't necessarily trace back your family for you, but only the origins of your line.    You might like to keep an eye on the offers though, because I know this time last year, they were offering the Y-chromosome test for half price. If you can save money, why not wait a bit?

K60FfiIfaa	Mmm, probably not.  He was an excellent leader and strategist, of course, but by "good" I assume you mean moral and caring.    He wasn't very caring or moral.  After capturing the Persian capitol of Persepolis he managed to burn down the fabulous palace in a drunken binge (supposedly, this is sort of apocryphal).  After returning to Babylon after his conquests in India, he became deathly ill, possibly from excessive alcohol consumption.  On his deathbed he refused to name a successor, which could've kept his empire whole and peaceful.  Instead he left it to his three generals to battle it out, potentially dooming his empire to bloodshed.  Fortunately his generals made a deal to split it up three ways so further bloodshed was avoided.    Alexander defeated and destroyed the Persian Empire, which had been a huge threat hanging over Greece for centuries.  I think for this reason Alexander is often seen as a hero in the west, since he was Greek, and the western world is based on the Greek culture to a significant degree.  But if you go into other parts of the world, especially Iran (modern day Persia), they see him as a brutal conqueror similar to Genghis Khan.
ceBTTCPwaa	Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (often shortened to Huck Finn) is a novel written by Mark Twain and published in 1884. It is commonly regarded one of the Great American Novels, and is one of the first major American novels written in the vernacular, characterized by local color regionalism. It is told in the first person by Huckleberry "Huck" Finn, best friend of Tom Sawyer and narrator of two other Twain novels.    The book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the Mississippi River. By satirizing a Southern antebellum society that was already anachronistic at the time of its publication, the book is an often scathing look at entrenched attitudes, particularly racism. The drifting journey of Huck and his friend Jim, a runaway slave, down the Mississippi River on their raft may be one of the most enduring images of escape and freedom in all of American literature.    http://www.bookrags.com/Adventures_of_Hu...    http://www.bookrags.com/notes/hf/    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/huckfinn/    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...    http://www.novelguide.com/huckleberryfin...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...    http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...    http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/H...    http://summarycentral.tripod.com/theadve...|`|xJoMSkI5aa	I personally disagree but the argument that has been made:     It is simply a story of a boy on a journey.

In fact much of the biblical text does not match the historical events of the time.  So Jesus is really a matter of FAITH.    Caesar on the other hand ... we have TONS of historical evidence.  We have his own writings in fact.  He kept a journal of his campaign in Gaul, not to mention the dozens of other sources from all around the Mediterranean region.    That aside, this is not a new statement that has been made by members of extreme faith in the Christian community.  It can be associated with statements like "humans and Dinosaurs lived together" based on a series of foot prints found in some solidified mud in Texas.  They are just made up stories to support a belief system ... not find facts.    If you want to baffle your friend ... ask her why Jesus was the only crucifixion of the era to be NAILED to a CROSS, when in fact the Romans practiced a form of crucifixion that involved TYING a person to a set of parallel bars (similar to the uneven bars in woman's gymnastics)???    Also the cross didn't become a symbol in the Church until the 4th Century CE.    Your Friend is WRONG!  Plain and simple.|`|ksOW8Y4Aaa	Your friend is either lying, woefully uniformed, or pulling your leg. There is NO contemporary historical evidence that Jesus ever even lived. The first accounts of is life date from decades after is death:    http://unitedcats.wordpress.com/2008/07/...    We have stuff written by Caesar, numerous contemporary accounts of his life, busts of him, etc. Granted most historians acknowledge that Jesus was a historical figure, but it would be nice to have some contemporary documentation. Might happen too, more scrolls at Qumrun (sp?) and books/scrolls in Pompei/Herculaneum have yet to be read.|`|AA11304025	Your friend needs psychiatric help|`|tFoSy2YRaa	I don't know of any evidence that Jesus existed apart from the Bible...which I don't really call evidence. I can believe that there was a popular preacher with a name like Jesus, but the resurrection...I can't just believe something like that...    As to Caesar...the idea that he didn't exist is pretty ridiculous. There is his own extensive writing for a start, along with accounts by several historians of both the classical period, middle ages and renaissance. Inscriptions in Rome and across the empire, scrolls, records...why would you think he didn't exist? he is a factual historical figure like any other..

dHjjLozcaa	My favorite character is Edward. Not because he is 'hawt' though. I really like that he was so sweet and protective to Bella and he really loved his family. He 's compassionate and romantic. And he treats Bella like she's his entire world.    But I do like Bella's character in the book, not so much in the movie though.|`|If2ww2i9aa	I love alice too!   Emmett also.   I never really got to know jasper...  And Nessie. She's just a little kid.

Edward=Creepy  Jacob=Annoying  The other Cullens are irritating.|`|1vGfcIf1aa	edward.  because he knows how to treat a girl.  and i absolutly LOVE and adore him.|`|AA10981338	I adore almost all of the characters but at the moment I am absolutely in love with Jasper Whitlock. He is so just amazing. Everything from his devotion to the Cullens and love/adoration of Alice is just awesome.|`|Isp36KB5aa	Rose because i love nikki reed|`|7d0iuSf6aa	i dislike jacob and rosalie sometimes. rosalie cuz shes a selfish ***** and doesnt care for bella ..and cuz jacob is an *** who forced bella to kiss him against her own will plus him being a butt to edward and bella's relationship. edward and bella forever    my faves include alice, bella, edward, emmett, charlie, ..etc.    i like alice cuz shesss so nice and luvs fashion and clothes like me but i like bella cuz shes really unique and her viewpoint in twilight is soo cool. edward because hes perfect, beautiful, caring, loving, self sacrficing, selfless and wonderful.. emmett is so funny! luv him|`|14UfFR3qaa	That guy with the cool hair, and "looks like he's in pain" whatshisname... jasper?|`|wq2QfVI3aa	I like Jacob in new moon before he became werewolf :/ but after he became too much like sam, i liked it before when he was Bella's sun :)|`|AA10711985	i like alice she is so awsome but kinda weird trendy but has her own style, she can kick butt AND she has an awsome baseball pitch|`|5tXFh0Oaaa	My favorite character is edward!! He is always taking care of bella and he loves her so much!! I like all of the characters too though..|`|KYzavZ7Vaa	i dont have just one favorite character. I have three.  I like alice because she is the perfect best friend, she will always be at your side whenever you need her and will always find a way to cheer you up.     I like Emmet because he is the perfect older brother you wish you had. He will protect you whenever you are in trouble and he is just plain hilarious with all his sex comments and making fun of bella. He is a an outgoing free spirited person who i just want to cuddle with =)    and ofcourse i love edward!!!!!!!! he is the perfect boyrfriend who loves you no matter what, will protect you, wants to always be with you, is fun to be around with, gorgeus, selfless, and will take a bullet for you anyday.      i dont hate any character but the least character that i like is probably bella. Not because i envy her (perfect boyrfriend and family and bestfriend) but because i find her obnoxious. Cmon seriously who says please to have sex with someone? "please, edward!" Give me a freaking break!!! and she is never satisfied with what she has and always ends up hurting those around her.|`|EJ1KWAPbaa	I love Alice and Edward!  Alice cause the way they describe her makes her so AWESOME!!! I would love to be her friend!  Edward cause he is so hot from the way they describe him in the book. He is also caring and gentle.    The Edward they chose for the movie is not the Edward i pictured. He's is not the Edward from the books. But Jacob IS LOL!!!!|`|fpRvJWSkaa	i think that every character have their own personality  so every character differs .we like the characters which we can relate to or we want to be like  or we find them physically or mentally attractive.  i like  bella to some extent ,i can relate to  the character.i even like Jacob and Edward.|`|flrmSi0Kaa	okay.. hard choice.    i like alice for the same reasons you do, and the fact that she is bizarrely innocent. but i also like seth clearwater, because he is a genuinely nice person. like edward says - he has the kindest thoughts he has ever heard.    i don't like bella that much- she's a sap who is ultimately selfish, and can't seem to exist without hurting someone. but she does have some good points, like cathy in wuthering heights, so i think that the point of the novel was that the heroine is imperfect.     renesmee's alright, but she doesn't actually do much does she? she's just kind of, there. and she doesn't have the most amazing power going.    and finally I HATE JACOB BLACK!! i know many people will strongly disagree, but that's how i feel. he's manipulative, and even more selfish than bella. in fact, i actually liked bella when she punched him in the face. i was gutted that he didn't feel it. :'(    and i really like esme too, she's so nice!! and emmett is just plain hysterical.    i think edward has the best ability. to read people's minds? how cool would that be!? alice's ability is too reliant on people's decisions, it would annoy me. i'd end up screaming- make up your MINDS for god's sake!    i think my favourite would have to be alice though. she's a little too wrapped up in material things, but that side of her is so funny, and cute.|`|8JAoUv1vaa	Hi!my favorite character is Bella because I am like her...but I also like very much edward because I think he's perfect,he's beautiful,kind,intellingent,romantic.  I dislike rosalie ,since she's too much vain,she is a little bit cinic..|`|W34Zhl4paa	My favorite Twilight Character is Jasper. Many people forget about him or don't think of him as special but he is and these are the reasons...       -He controls emotions.       -He is with Alice and everyone loves Alice. =]       -He was in the civil war and was a general (very powerful)       -He is quiet and very wise       -He had such a hard past and he's trying to redeem himself.  Most of all: he's not perfect, unlike edward, and that makes him more relate-able. I also like Alice, Edward, Carlisle, and Seth.|`|TCQP2iShaa	I like the book version of Bella and dislike the movie version of Bella.    Why?    In the book Bella actually expressed emotion unlike Kristen Stewart who did nothing but stutter and cause premature wrinkles with her faux frown lines.
9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	An intellectual pursuit would be a course or reading or study.  A non-intellectual pursuit would be earning more money, developing the physical skills involved in woodworking, forging metal, football - any physical endeavor requiring training - traveling to see the sights and/or meet people.  The goal or achievement would be the conclusion.      It is possible to mix the two, for example going to Europe to study the ancient buildings first time while meeting people to make contacts but also studying with them.    Studying the history of painting to be a critic or historian is an intellectual pursuit, studying the history of painting to be a painter is not.
zfueTHk2aa	Ego was the biggest issue. There's a supposed quote of his father that goes "My son, ask for thyself another kingdom, for that which I leave is to small for thee"    If the quote is historically accurate, there's no doubt that this could have developed into a megalomania complex in his life. He also was far too driven in the idea of conquering the Asian mainland.    Another story of him tells of the Gordian knot, and that the man who could untie the knot was rightful ruler of all Asia. The story goes that Alexander took his sword and cut through the knot, allowing the whole thing to unravel and fall to his feet. Yet again, Megalomania. He led his men through most of southern Asia, but being men, they were easily tired of the war and bloodshed from the years of marching through the continents. Tales refer to his men finally turning on him and sending him tampered medicines to kill him.    No such tales are confirmed, as the death is still considered shrouded in mystery today. Some say it was natural causes, but many of the accounts say he was still very healthy in his early thirties (having died at 33) and that the death was strange to be of natural causes.     Hope that helps with your need of flaws/weaknesses. As for strengths/merits; the man was very charismatic and a brilliant tactician, IMO.|`|Ig35GCyMaa	His weakness was that he coudn't stop conquering the world.  Its like hey Alexander its great and all that you have takin over all this land, but somewhere you got to stop. and he didn't listen so he died.|`|iMeh9lMbaa	Strenght: he was brave & ruthless.

5TSW3eK9aa	I don't remeber off the top of my head, but checking on the internet, I found a number of reviews saying that it's set in Britain in the (late) 1990s. The story encompasses the period from the 3 main characters' schooldays to the time when the main character, Kathy, is 31 (this is the "present" time in the novel, the time when she is narrating her story), so the story covers a period of approximately 20-25 years.    It should also be kept in mind that as this book is science fiction (you could also call it a dystopia), it presents an alternate reality of the 90s.

AA10062543	Huck is the most compassionate and human of all the characters, even though he has the best excuse not to be (alcoholic father, uneducated, etc.)  Even though Huck is what the other character consider to be "uncivilized" Twain uses Huck's unusually good nature and morality to show the  flaws with "civilization"

We just make one up that fits our word view and pretend that it makes sense.    Love and blessings Don|`|TdE0J2xVaa	This conundrum borders on a religious theme.  The man born into a life of poverty surely must strive harder to get ahead but it is not unattainable.  The self made man is trying to protect his hard earned assets but is certainly egregious in killing the poor man who tries to rob him.  We are not born on equal footing; there are folks who have a head start, either because they're born with a silver spoon in their mouth or they've been reared to be ambitious and self-motivated.  People who born into abject poverty just have to fight harder.  There are thousands of stories of men and women who emigrated to this country with only a few dollars in their pocket and are now multimillionaires.  They had the ambition and motivation to make it.    And so, the religious connotation to my answer is "you reap what you sow".|`|4c7QomPoaa	Theft is theft.  Killing is killing.  The decisions the poor man made, led him to the point of being killed.  The decisions of the person who killed him (I'm assuming it's the self-made man) led him to kill the poor man.  The poor man is guilty of robbery the self-made man is guilty of homicide.  Society doesn't bow to people, for better or worse.  Conformity or non-conformity is the choice of each person, and we are each responsible, ultimately, for our choices.|`|145RUNQHaa	It s quite simple.if you can t provide for a child don t have one.why should you be allowed to have a child you know will be born into a life of poverty.you should need a license to have a child to prove that you can provide for them and bring them up properly and kindly.the rest should be strerilised.that would solve a lot of problems as ultimately that is the root cause.|`|AA11442722	Bad analogy for several reasons.     First the thief would also kill someone trying to steal his possessions. Each man is born with the right to self determination. That is to fight, kick, claw and scratch an existance for themselves and to defend one's freedom and possessions by whatever means are necessary.     2nd the thief may well be striking back for various social reasons. His target isn't the "self made" man. His target might be purely economically chosen but that is rare. Various class warfare, ethnic, religious and political causes come into play. Rarely are victims of crime just unlucky. They are chosen because they offend the crimminal in some way. They are the enemy of the criminal. Otherwise the criminal just picks on people who are nearby and convienent. That is why most crime is the same ethnic group against itself. Those are targets of opportunity and unless your self made man has wandered down to the poor side of the world or otherwise been thrust into contact with the thief they would never meet.  If they did meet the crime was less motivated by goods and riches and more motivated by hate of some sort.     Many of those ideas are of course fiction. When I grew up the "rich" were the bad guys and anybody who wasn't poor was rich. As such they were the enemy. They were who I heard day in and day out in the poor side of town caused the misery we were doused in. It was the "rich" who sent the cops to war against us for the sin of being poor and living in the wrong neighborhood. I'm White but hear the same thing from Hispanics, Asians and Blacks who grew up poor but instead of the "rich" it was Whites or rich Whites. Same principle. Injustice happened, then was propagated against the people who likely had nothing to do with it in the first place. Then again you do see people who are wealthy or upper middle class saying some really stupid things like the poor should be kept from breeding or that prison administrator in Az who rejoices in tormenting prisoners.      Class warfare is not longer measured by money these days. It has taken on a very complex set of features but is still very much alive in the US and your question actually illustrates it. You describe the self made man. Who just happened to get a scholarship because they were not arrested for merely standing on the wrong street corner every week. Who's friends were not executed by gangs, police or died young from their own stupidity. You speak of man who reached 21 without bitterness and hate in his heart. Unscarred by the community he grew up in.     No throwing money at such problems won't solve a thing, in fact it'd only make it worse. Socialism is the organized humilation of the human spirit. It is to spit on everything good in people and to praise what is worst in humanity. The answer is simple. A just society where who you are and what you do is what matters and nothing else.|`|C0sT0PPyaa	In the book 'the prophet'  the author writes about not scolding the criminals for tripping on the same rocks that we passed by and didn't pick up oursleves|`|YzwuDRfYaa	The "deep philosophical lesson" is that human beings are not born equal.  Some are born brilliant and some are born retarded.    To be born into poverty or wealth is nothing to be ashamed or proud of.  (Unlucky or lucky, maybe).      While robbery and theft will always be regarded as crimes, lack of support for those less capable should also be regarded as reprehensible in any civilized society.    It is the responsibility of any good government to assist those who, through no fault of their own, are genuinely in need of help.
cTpBEj81aa	The Spanish were seeking wealth, and often oppressed the native people of the regions.  In many cases, Catholics led a cause to convert the "pagans" to Christianity, threatening them with death if they did not convert.

I saw "probably not" because it's not impossible for him to have picked up the virus but never known it because no one at the time knew what AIDS was.

a7a7a0bfe671ddedd1999ac93097444caa	The most correct answer would be c)... the Russians (Soviets) have an inherent inferiority complex and paranoia regarding Western Europe.  It was rather well known at the TIME that General Patton was pushing to invade the Soviet Union immediately after the surrender of German.    Patton thought, rightly, that the Soviet Union would cease being an Ally and become an enemy.    The theory stated by another that it was because of Jupiter missiles in Turkey is COMPLETE TRIPE... those missiles weren't in place until 1962... almost TWENTY years after the end of WWII.    French Troops weren't on the Polish border... that was England's Zone.    The West had enough Oil in the Persian Gulf, US, and Mexico|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	History had taught the Russians to be wary of the West. Germans had invaded Russia on many occasions, and twice in the last 20 years, at that point. France had also invaded under Napoleon. Moreover, there were a fair number of British and American Generals (George Patton most vocal among them) that were pressing to do just that. They saw the Soviet Union as a threat, and wanted to press ahead, and crush the Russians. Considering the technological advantages (most especially the atomic bomb), it's possible it could have been successful, although one has to suspect that the war weary civilians of both Britain and the US would likely not have supported such a move, no matter how much sense it made.|`|AA11304025	This is utter nonsense|`|2277af9334d38e9e40b267c6c7f5f318aa	The western powers never demanded any oil from the Soviet Union.  They dominated all of eastern Europe after WW 2 because those 2 fools Roosevelt and Churchill gave in when Stalin demanded it instead of telling him to go climb a tree. Russia had been invaded by Napoleon, there was no Soviet Union back then. The Germans invaded at the start of WW 2. French troops of all people were massing at the Polish border? Pure science fiction.|`|9pC2u5ZWaa	Well after Yalta Churchill DID want to cut the Soviets out of Eastern Europe.  Churchill didn't trust Stalin (rightly it turns out) would allow free elections in Eastern Europe after the war.  He wanted to invade in Greece instead of France to try and cut off Soviet control of what became Yugoslavia.  FDR was by this time very sick and was more interested in defeating Germany than positioning for the next fight with Russia.|`|OFA2LAM5aa	US and Western propaganda claimed that it was the Soviets who threatened the West, not the other way around.      Today, after the Cold war has passed and as new information has arisen. We now know that the US and the Western powers threatened the Soviet Union.    The US placed missiles in Turkey, right on the border of the Soviet Union. When the Soviets responded by placing missiles in Cuba, the US claimed it was a direct threat to their existence...yet the US never mentioned the missiles in Turkey.    US spy planes regularly flew over Russia, with such frequency that the Soviets felt the US was preparing to attack them.  The Soviet Union complained to the US, but the US lied and denied it flew spy planes over Russian territory.    When the Soviet Union shot down a US spy plane over its territory, the pilot parachuted safely, they had indisputable proof that the US was spying on them.      The Soviet Union (Russia) had vast resources of oil in Siberia, the largest reserves of natural gas in the world and raw iron ore, diamonds and gold.   Like Hitler, the west eyed these natural resources with envy.  There was a plan to seize the oil fields if a US/west invasion of Russia occurred.      Russia was invaded before, in June of 1941.  They were ill-prepared for a Nazi invasion and suffered huge losses.  Though as they regained their footing, they pushed back the Nazi invasion.  By the end of WWII, the Soviet Union had lost 26 million people. The largest loss of life of any country or people in the conflict.  Never again, they proclaimed....never again would anyone kill that many Russians and not suffer equal or worse losses.     After WWII the Soviet Union armed itself, and when the West lined its tanks on the East German border, and US ships patrolled too close to the Russian Pacific coast, they waved their fist and shouted, never again...never again .    The US threat to the Soviet Union was real.  And the Soviet Union did not blink, instead they prepared to fight an invading attacking US to the death. Never again, would a foreign force invade their country without being punished severely.|`|AA10187097	The Soviet Union had been invaded by Napoleon and the Germans.    My guess is after Hitler,they wanted to make sure it never happened again. Also,Stalin was well-known for his paranoia at the best of times.|`|ihDESJZfaa	Russia had been almost annihilated.  There army was large but poorly organised.  The west were anti-communist   The entire allied army sat on the opposite side of berlin with the tanks running. The tanks were constantly fuelled by hoses from fuel trucks. Britain demanded free elections in eastern europe.|`|IGGmNExRaa	None of the 4 answers is really correct.  Some soviet political and military circles were afraid after 1945 that right wing americans would collude with revanchist germans and other right wing persons in western europe to prepare an invasion of the soviet union,especially as the soviets did not have the nuclear weapon at this time.  See the talk of generals like patton who said that the US had fought the wrong enemy.  The fears were in some way unsubstantiated,as germany was totally down and no other european country would have been willing to assist the US in such a dangerous undertaking;considering the red army was dominant in conventional arms.|`|5PiWNiJZaa	The answer lies in the collective memory of the Soviet leadership after the end of WWII. The Western powers helped the White forces in the Russian Civil War in an attempt to destroy the Bolsheviks before they could consolidate power. They were shunned for the best part of two decades in the prelude of WWII and the Soviets felt that the Western powers had tried to push Hitler eastwards after the Munich Agreement in 1938.    The Soviet Union was an expansive empire, looking to spread its ideology as much as any Western power before it, however the Soviet Union was far more overt in its use of force and it naturally felt threatened that the West would not stand for its new sphere of influence over eastern Europe.     The psyche of Josef Stalin was also one of a paranoid and aggressive person, he was even more suspicious of the West after the invasion of the USSR in 1941 and his belief that the West was in no rush to invade Germany itself. Because of his paranoia, which worked its way down through the Soviets ranks their was a belief that the West would attack the Soviets.    One should bear in mind the Marxist-Capitalist bent on the dealings with both sides aswell, Marxism was openly hostile to the idea of Capitalism, therefore the Soviet system was opposed to the 'evil' of Capitalism and was therefore in some sort of 'cosmic struggle' between ideologies.    The change of US presidents from the more amicable Roosevelt to the more stern and hard line Harry S Truman affected the post war relations between East and West, and Stalin would no doubt have felt threatened by Truman, who was much less willing to negeotiate with Stalin.    And finally the fact the Allies had kept some major secrets from the Soviet's during the war, namely the Manhatten project, bred distrust of the West in the USSR, now that the West had the most powerful weapon in the world.

I find it hard to take a questioner, or an answerer, seriously if they cannot be bothered to look their entry over, and if they are genuinely dyslexic, to use Spell Check.     But I will answer your question anyway, because I did understand what you are asking.     First of all, you are making the assumption that your answerers found something to dislike about "The Secret Life Of Bees", or perhaps you are asking only those who did find something to dislike about the book. I did not like this book, and that is why I am answering you.    What I dislike about this book is that it is following a pattern that is becoming a genre, which is novels that focus on an ingenuous, naive sweet little white girl who is thrust into a clan of black people and then lives a life of selfless purity and True Appreciation of Black People with her Artlessly Profound statements. This may have been all right once in one book, or maybe even once in a while, for I do like the idea of color-blindness or at least people living in peace, which is not the absence of conflict but the ability to cope with it. But when one author "does" a theme, and then others sense a marketable thread, a subject of this sensitivity is exploited and swiftly reaches a saturation point of entire communities everywhere filled with unique cloying children of  intolerable  innocence, resembling nothing so much as a modern artificial sweetener used to excess.

bO2rzfISaa	There were a number of issues that led to Mary taking the throne . First, Henry VIII had placed Mary in the succession before he died, and that was taken very seriously.  Though the mass had been outlawed during James reign, numerous English people still practiced it secretly, and they were happy to see a Catholic come back to power. Also, James affirmed Mary's place in the succession. An army gathered to insure Mary's succession, also. Additionally, Henry's children were beloved by the people.|`|JS3Zy6ASaa	Not in the least.

da8zv4hvaa	She was the last Pharaoh to rule Egypt. She descended from Ptolemy a friend of Alexander the Great. She was a woman, and women of that time never had as much power than men, they stood behind men while Cleopatra stood in front of them, or at least tried to. She seduced Gaius Julius Caesar, one of the most powerful men of that time, and in history. She tried conquering Rome after Caesar died with her new love Marc Antony, Rome was something other countries tried not to take on, but she did, and with pride to. She killed herself, committed suicide after her and her beloved Marc Antony lost to Rome, instead of Octavian (Caesar's Heir, aka Augustus) taking her to Rome and Parading her through the streets and killing her. She also had a son by Caesar that Octavian killed, Caesar had no other male children, other than Cleopatra's and his son, but Octavian took the heir, because he was full Roman and Cleopatra's son wasn't full Roman.         If she never had existed, I don't know? I can't even think about. Maybe Egyptian Pharaohs could have continued into the common era. Rome would have never conquered Egypt like they did after Cleopatra died.

ghMJyzsOaa	Our strengths are a product of our weakness. In order to be strong we would have had to evolve mentally, emotionally, and physically. Weakness and strengths are inseparable, one could not exist without the other; they compliment each other. When we are conscious of our weakness, we naturally desire to experience the understanding we hold, concerning the stronger contrasting opposite end of this polarity.     In fact in the knowing that we harbour a weakness, we are mutually aware that their is something more than what we currently posses. Acknowledgement of our weakness will inspire our motivation to fortify the weakness so that we can experiences the state of being and feeling strong, but what we perceive now as being strong, will in time, expose itself as being a weakness, because we are always growing in our understanding and becoming more than what we were.     When we fully embrace and genuinely accept our weakness with affection, all the resistance we feel from trying to escape from it will cease. And a relaxed state of tranquillity will gradually resume, making it much easier to accomplish greater achievements. Experiment with the weakness, play with its design build a relationship with it, while gently building it up into a fortress. Weakness and strengths are cemented through a unified bond.    Many people, me being, once, one of them; always inexorably strive to be what they think would make them feel confidently strong, but they are also, always trying to conceal and supress their weakness, pretending that it did not exist. Consequently, taking many more years, than it should of done to become stronger, and many years of suffering in a needless weakness, that could have been properly adressed over months, saving many years of suffering, living with the frustrations of unfulfilment.    We should always work from the base of our weakness, and embrace the compromising exposure, especially in the company of others, it is here where, we will develope our true strength. Weakness is an intrinsic apar of the process, that compels us to transform it into a strength through the process of dancing elegantly and lovingly with it. There is no stonger strength in my opinion, than one who is not affraid of his or her own weakness. In my weakness I am in the perfect position to cultivate my strength.|`|TdE0J2xVaa	Yes, I strongly believe that my weaknesses can be overcome.

6g3Z8NwVaa	Geez, obviously these people don't know what you're talking about....    Well, it really depends on the kind of screen print you want to make. Like are you planning on creating the image by hand? Are you making it on a computer and then printing that out? The method I find most easy is photographic screen printing. These are the things you'll need:    1. screen with a frame  2. photo emulsion kit (emulsion, sensitizer, remover)  3. neoprene squeegee  4. a flat, small, plastic squeegee (or a plastic credit card works great)  5. silkscreening inks  6. if you can get it, clamps to stabilize your screen    With this method you'll have to create a print of your image on a transparency. They can do that at Kinkos for you. The really low budget way is to print your image on paper and drench the paper in oil so it's see through.     Then in a dark room (or literally a blacked out dark room), you'll flood the screen with the emulsion mixture. This is where you can use the card to spread it evenly, and thinly. You have to make sure you don't expose the screen to light until you're ready to burn your image onto it. Let it dry. Then situate your image on the outside of the screen, in the opposite orientation of printing. You can hold your transparency or paper onto the screen with clear tape for control.  If you have a UV light, expose it to that for about 30-seconds or so. If not, take it outside and expose it with the sun for a good 2-3 minutes. You'll have to experiment with this one. After it's exposed you have to wash it with water to reveal the emulsion stencil. A hose works well or we used to take it to the car wash. Let it dry. Then just clamp your screen down, flood it with ink, then using  the neoprene squeegee press on the screen from top to bottom onto your printing surface.

In order to find you need to know, but happiness you cannot know, only feel. Imagine yourself like a child on his first day at school. The child might not he might not like the school at first but school is what will eventually lead him to greater understanding of happiness in life.     We cannot be happy, just the way we cannot be good, or bad. We exist within the regions of uncertainties in between good and bad, right and wrong, happiness and sorrow, all the time, making choices, learning, taking each step with care and caution. The best way to experience happiness therefore is in the way of learning what truly is happiness. But if you come claiming, expecting, and wanting to be happy then most of times you will be disappointed. If you come with an open mind, and yearning mind, with honestly and as your guides, with politeness of your manner, with kindness of your words, in humility, as an eager but respectful learner then you will never be disappointed.

AA11442722	The biggest advantage in a fight is the will to win and the motivation of the individuals. The more motivated has an advantage that may accent or compensate for other advantages such as age, experience, skill and size.     It's a fair fight as long as both are willing participants in the fight. To lose a fight is almost always better than to have run from a fight, even a fight one could not win as you learn from the fight, thus becoming better at fighting. You are respected for willingness to fight as well. Cowards are never respected.     Honor is adherance to your own codes and many of these have nothing to do with conflict, however the lack of honor is the unwillingness to do what is right because of personal risk. To do the right thing when it is easy is not honor. It is to stand up even in a fight you have little chance of winning for the principle in question. To fight for what you believe in even knowing the consequences of such a fight. Honor is to not give in to temptation even if there is no chance of being caught.     Honor is important in many ways but since this is about fighting we'll address the most basic principle of honor. Say you are standing next to a man who has killed somebody. How do you know they will not kill you?  Seriously. You can say they are your friend but was the man they killed thier friend? Have you never had a fight with a friend and become an enemy? Honor is that means of being able to use violence for necessary purposes yet knowing that it will not be used except as prescribed by the code of honor followed by that person. So as long as you do not violate the unwritten laws of your group that person if honorable will not kill you or steal from you, etc. The lack of honor means a free for all where nothing constructive can happen as each is guarding themselves from anyone else. As such the lack of honor destroys the base of society. No pile of lawbooks can replace honor. A cop on every street corner cannot replace honor. To have a working society you must have honor. Else none may trust another and without trust we are nothing.|`|VLP5l3J0aa	In a fight there is to be a winner and a loser. Some people actually think that a kick to the groin is unfair and uncool. I'm 47 years old and I have been in God only knows how many fights. I did whatever it took to win. I did not fight to be known as a boy scout. I fought for honor as well as to keep from getting my *** whipped.  Eye gouge a kick to the groin and yes a kick to the face when they are down and about to get back up is what wins the fight. It's a dog eat dog world we live in. I did not make the rules I just abide by them.|`|AA11828439	Nope.|`|AA10015648	It's a fair fight when both people enter the fight willingly, despite any existing advantage or disadvantage.    A fair fight is almost never instigated by the more powerful, for the more powerful has nothing to gain by exerting their power over the weaker. But the weaker has much to gain, because if they defeat the one who is more powerful, then they climb in ranks. Despite being smaller, he is smarter and quicker and proved that he is not "lesser" than the bigger person. If the weaker person is defeated, then it was still a fair fight because they were the ones who instigated the dispute, and were "put in their place" by the stronger person.|`|RvEnbEJcaa	i consider Gandhi a fair fighter. he harmed no one and he was being fair with what he wanted. so i think there is.|`|0Wt4QGgJaa	define fair... imagine two students who have studied karate for years decide to try for the national championships. they win their fights and come up against each other. one has to win and one has to lose. i would assume that the honor part comes in where the loser is able to say "the better man won, i must train harder, see you next time". in this situation the participants knew they would fight and were willing to.    in the case of beating someone outright, there is no honor bullying can be considered a misuse of power, much like beating someone just for the fun of it. fighting where one of the participants not willing would also not be honorable

9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	Refusing medical intervention on the grounds of survival of the fittest is one of the really dumb extensions of the theory of evolution and has nothing to do with what Darwin was explaining.  It has more to do with science fiction than science.   By the time of Darwin, most scientists accepted that species changed and adapted, unlike the religious belief that God made them and they never changed, the problem being to explain how they changed.  Today, we realize that species build up a stockpile of changes that have no consequences in daily life, but improve the chances of some to survive when under stress, as of drought, climate change, disease, etc.|`|AA11304025	no|`|AA10303012	I have never heard that he did, nor would his theories have suggested that he would have.  His premise of "survival of the fittest" has nothing to do with whatever creature was the strongest or the most capable of defending itself.  "Fittest" in his concept simply suggests that whichever creature had the most appropriate attributes to survive in its own environment.  For example, a black or brown mouse was more likely to survive than a white mouse because its darker color made it more akin to its environment than a white mouse, and therefore more hidden from predators who could see the white mouse more readily.  It was more "fit"  for its environment than the white mouse.  Thats not to say it was stronger or healthier, just more "fit" to survive.

a7a7a0bfe671ddedd1999ac93097444caa	Yes, Stalin was married with children...    Ekaterina Svanidze, m.July 28, 1906. She contracted typhus and died on December 5, 1907    On March 31, 1907, she gave birth to Stalin's first child, Yakov.    Stalin had a son, Vasiliy, and a daughter, Svetlana, with his second wife Nadezhda Alliluyeva. She died in 1932, officially of illness. She may have committed suicide by shooting herself after a quarrel with Stalin, leaving a suicide note which according to their daughter was "partly personal, partly political"    Stalin also had a son named Konstantin Kuzakov together with the landlady Maria Kuzakova during his 1911 exile in Solvychegodsk.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Stali...

I would say "No." and Pick Josef Stalin ( agree with 'MusicMan )    But, I have to explain my reasoning --    First -- It depends if You are Defining Power --     Relative to IT's Period In-Time -- I would say Alexander the Great.    Though he has less Territory -- In HIS TIME -- It was a Powerful and Remarkable Achievement.    Under this Category -- I would also say Emperor Trajan of Rome.    However -- If you are saying the Most Powerful -- Irregardless to Any Point in History --    Then that changes the Argument for me.    I also do not consider Genghis Khan a Dictator, but a Conqueror.    His most Remarkable achievement was being the Turcoman Son of an "Average" Mongolian --    He was able to Unite ALL the MONGOLIAN TRIBES -- Which was Amazing IMO.    Let's see --    I'm not really sure on the Geography, but "His" Empire conquered everything from NW Russia, The Middle East all the way to Eastern Asia and the North part of China.    I think Germany, Poland, & Hungary were conquered After His Death --    ...and the Complete conquest of China was not completed, until his Grandson, Kublai.    STALIN -- While he was not much of a "Warrior" IMO -- He was what WE in the West, classify as a Dictator -- and Ruled over the Largest Territory in History.    MAO killed more of his own People -- But STALIN had more Territory.    So, that's my Conclusion --     If I've made a Mistake -- Please Feel Free to Correct Me !! :)    My strongest Area of History is 500 BCE to 800 CE/AD :)    EDIT -- Oh, I missed the rest of Your Question !!    "Was Genghis Khan EVIL ??"    Absolutely Not -- If you Look at His Motivation.    All Great Conquerers, start out -- as their Own Percieved, but Honest Assessment of Expanding Territory for the GOOD of Their Own People.    That was Attilla the Hun's sole motivation, for instance....    YES -- He was a Horrible Man, by today's Standards, in How he Tortured his Prisoners -- Burying them Alive by the Hundreds, etc....    I do NOT excuse This As EVIL -- But for the TIme in History that we are discussing (the 7th Century) -- It what done mostly for "Keeping Fear" in the Minds of those Conquered --    It cannot be Proven that it was Done out of Saddism -- Which I personally think IS "Evil" -- Also a "Mental Disorder" :))    The Romans Horribly Tortured peoples with one hand -- and "patted them on the head" with the Other.    We've had Torture -- Well into the 21st Century.    But it depends on Your Own Definition of EVIL --     In order to determine if Torture has a Purpose to assist the Preservation of the Conqueror -- OR -- if it is Indeed "Power Trippin' Saddism" !! --     Are completely Different, ethically.... Just my subjective opinion...    EDIT - You can also say that FDR was a Dictator, since he basically "threw away the Constitution" --    But, He was a Great Dictator -- Not an Evill One.    In times of Great Peril -- sometimes these things have to be done -- and at the time of the Depression -- FDR Really (and Intelligently) put the Legislative Branch under HIS Power -- in order to Get Stuff Done as Quick as Possible -- and the Legislatve Majority -- Agreed with --    So, I think He did the Right Thing -- UnConstitutionally, or Not.    ...and the U.S. became Greater Than the Soviet Union... but more so After FDR's Death.    EDIT 2 --    Some Answers have Referred to American Presidents - most likely due to the Indigenous Tribes & Slavery of Africans, etc.    Even Manifest Destiny -- which Brought Great Wealth to the U.S. under James K. Polk, but Conguering the Mexican Territory of California (with NO Provocation) -- Can be considered -- EVIL and Dictatorial.    But -- This is the Story of the ALL of History !!    ALL Current Governments in This World are Run by Peoples who were NOT the original Indigenous Peoples.    It is SAD -- But it is the Way of The World -- and a Lot of Tough Luck.    But, whomever put Bush, Jr. as a Dictator ??    LOL !!    How can you be a Dictator -- When you barely EVER VETOED a Single Bill ??? Demorcrat or Repbulican Produced ??    LMAO :))    ...and whomever said -- It should be the person in charge of the  "ruthless overthrow of the Native Americans" --     At that Time -- The U.S. was Far From Being the Most Powerful Country !!     ...and btw -- "The TRIBES of Indigenous Peoples on this Contnent" --     Do NOT Like the term "Native Americans" --     That Term was Created by "Self-Loathing" & "Politically Correct" White-Liberals in the Early 1990's, to Replace the Old Term, "Indians" )    Bless their little Bleeding Hearts...  :))  .|`|9OU8Xv1Oaa	second after Bush.

The way the mongols fought meant that they could not invade europe, as there were too many forests, sooner or later the empire was bond to fall, like all empires really, but this one didn't have a very long life.    However, obviously HItler had a lot stronger army, It was also ruled with a iron hand, even if you mentioned a bad word of hitler you would be killed.    Personally, i think Hiter was the most Powerful dictator, reason being, He very nearly won WW2 had he not declared war on America causing him to fight a 2 front war. He ruled Europe with propaganda and fear, people wouldn't dear stand up to him, if they did they would die.  You have to remember that also, Hitler had defeated nearly all the superpowers in the World. Including Britain, which it was so close to defeating at one stage, Britain had the worlds biggest empire the world had ever seen when it was at war with the Nazis, (it owned one third of the worlds land and a quarter of its population) However the Nazis had pretty much defeated the British during 1943... Along with france which was also powerful, and it had Russia on the verge of collapse, RUSSIA! which had a bigger army then the hole world put to gather.  Hitler was up against a lot more stiffer opposition then Genghis Khan.    I think Genghis khan was evil, but also good, Evil because he caused millions to die, but he was good to the people he new, wich was the same as Hitler, he had a wife and loved his mother, but he still did horible things. But on the hole, both were very evil as they caused millions to die.

osFEzMy5aa	you're still talking about freitag's triangle there. So, in a sense, you have a traditional story structure. But sure, that will definitely work and would make readers keep on going. When you say small build up them mini climax then another build up, you're describing traditional story structure. Your just calling your overcoming of obstacles "climaxes" or "mini climaxes" which is what they are in reality.|`|JEP4CmyUaa	Yes|`|vSTtAfOWaa	Yes that is fine! I have read many stories with multiple climaxes. Just kind of make the one at the end the biggest....I guess.

MTwqyZuRaa	Desperate (starving in the french revolution case) people, new ideas (like the enlightened thinkers in the FR - Voltaire, montesque etc) and terrible systems of monarchy.    I would explore cultural, social and economic reasons first... there were droughts, businesses were failing, leads to disease... starvation.. inflation... debt    Its all a huge chain reaction in my opinion which ends up snow balling out of control until you get events like the French revolution when the people were so desperate to have justice they became blood thirsty and beheaded anyone they could!     Education of the masses... well its a point to consider... you could tak about how in early Austria education was causing problems (banishment of the Grimm Brothers) due to the spread of ideas...  but then again in FR (sorry to keep referring to it) education of the masses wasnt an issue... infact many would've been illiterate so educaton makes little or no difference  I could ramble on but i doubt i'd stay on the topic... i'd end up arguing about the injustices of man or something irrelevant!!|`|D9cjI9Y1aa	for me revolutions are a result of the desperation of the people.

w13Zbnk7aa	the enlightenment was a time that forever influenced history. It was a shift from labor (it's hard to sum up former history in one word) to the acceptance and rewarded concept of knowledge. Enlightenment could possibly be defined as the advancement towards the mastery of a common goal. VERY similar to the definition of progress...hmmm...very interesting:  progress: the advancement towards a goal  the problem with this is that now goal needs to be defined...see the pattern? that is one problem found in this part of history.    I wrote a paper about this subject. PLEASE give me credit if any quotes are being used. Or adjust the wording and just use ideas:    "We are not enlightened because there is always more progress that can be obtained through science, religion, and social interactions. We, our society of religious and scientific researchers, can not be comforted by the feeling of thoroughly complete accomplishment of all possible knowledge, also known as enlightenment. Enlightenment is dependant on question and answer, and consequently we are only enlightened if we have no more questions to ask."    Can Science prove the existence of God? How does the brain work? Is war our biological destiny? (Times).     enlightenment is mans leaving his self-caused immaturity. Immaturity is the incapacity to use ones intelligence without the guidance of another (Kant 1).    "We are also not yet enlightened in religion because beliefs are still molding and growing to the social norm. Many early scientists were threatened with torture. Galileo Galilei published his works of new scientific findings and was shown the instruments of torture because he was vehemently suspected of heresy (MEH 2)."    "This is an example of progress that the church has done over time, but how do we know there will not be anymore? How do we know if we have reached the enlightenment through religion? From Ren Descartess perspective, we may never. His first rule states that one should never receive anything as a truth which I did not clearly know to be such (Descartes 1). "    "Rewarding virtue is also an important aspect that is necessary to achieve enlightenment (Beccaria 1). "|`|YbwDFvEaaa	The "Enlightenment" refers to a period of time in history when authors and artists were once again focusing on nature and man's connection with nature, in a time when the rest of the world was focusing more on industry and capitalism.    Ralph Waldo Emmerson and Emily Dickenson are two examples of writers in the mid-19th century who were part of the Enlightenment era.|`|AA11942204	This site will help you http://www.historywiz.com/enlightenment....

My purpose as the person who is reading your poem is to show you how i saw and interpreted it- which doesn't make me wrong- and doesn't make me right.    "Head tilted gives her a stare  She mistakes it for a glare"    The significance in the line is blurry. i feel that it was a forced rhyme because there is no follow up after it.. it is just sort of random.  the dove mistakes it for a glare because he's going to eat her? or he hates her? or he's going to hurt her? where does it show that the Dove was wrong about his "glare?" the narrator sees the crow keeping the dove warm as a romantic thing.. but what does the Dove see it as? is the dove still frightened of the crow? does the dove think that the crow is just keeping her warm so that he can eat or harm her later? does the dove think that the crow has her trapped or kidnapped because she is wounded?      other than that one part i thought the poem was interesting.

"say something please, tell someone now" what exactly is your subconscious trying to get you to tell people? to commit suicide?   and then you randomly mention your father.. does this mean that you want to commit suicide because of your father? i think the mentioning your father in the poem is a bit random..  i also think that mentioning the ocean is random too.  without your title the ocean would completely be random.. i would understand if there was a theme of the ocean going throughout the poem.. like having other references to water etc in your first stanza's like "subliminal messages "trickle" inside" (notice that water "trickles" which add to an ocean theme)  "When i "emerge", I block it out" "emerge" refers to water which caters more to the theme.    it seems as though your poem was created on a whim and not planned out until the last minute..  i'm not saying that is a bad thing.. but i'm just telling you that i notice it.  i think you should organize your thoughts better.  i do like the imagery.. i do think there could be a bit more.. but what you have is alright.|`|zU1hrRIgaa	Very good!

Also no two Pandavs had similar talents so Arjun was as different from his brothers as Bhim or Yudhistr.  What I belive made Arjun so special was his ability to literally drain out knowledge from his gurus. Which made him a fearsome warrior with unparalleled knowledge and arsenal (he even had many godly weapons).  He also seems to be lovable, as those older than him can't help but be affectionate towards him, most prominently Bhishma followed by his guru Drona.  Lastly what truly made his special was that Krishna chose to be by his side.|`|pPtvkYwpaa	First of all, the question should not be under 'History'. Though all the five brothers have many wives,Arjuna is a specialist in the regard.|`|ZB9zkbxxaa	Arjuna,Arjun or Arjunaa (Sanskrit: ??????, arjuna) is one of the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahbhrata, whose name means 'bright', 'shining', 'white' or 'silver' (cf. Latin argentum). Arjuna was such a peerless archer that he is often referred to as Jishnu - the undefeatable. The third of the five Pandava brothers, Arjuna was one of the children borne by Kunti, the first wife of Pandu. Arjuna is considered to be an incarnation of Nara, the younger brother of Narayana.Arjuna or Prtha was a master archer and played a central role in the conflict between the Pandavas and their adversaries, the sons of Dhritarashtra known as the Kauravas. Arjuna was reluctant to take part in battle because of the slaughter he knew he would cause in the enemy ranks, which included many of his own relatives. He was persuaded by his charioteer and close friend, Lord Krishna, to change his mind. Their dialogue about issues involved in warcourage, a warriors duty, the nature of human life and the soul, and the role of Godsforms the subject of the Bhagavad Gita, one of the key episodes in the epic Mahbhrata. He also played the key role in killing Karna, his arch-rival, in reality an unknown brother, on the side of the Kauravas. He bears an additional ten names: Kounteya, Phalguna, Jishnu, Kireeti, Shwetavaahana, Bheebhatsu, Vijaya, Prtha, Savyasaachi, and Dhananjaya.Pandu was unable to sire a child. His first wife Kunti had, in her maiden days, received a boon from sage Durvasa, which enabled her to invoke any deity of her choice and beget a child by such deity. Pandu and Kunti decided to make use of this boon; Kunti invoked in turn Yama, Vayu and Indra and gave birth to three sons. Arjuna was the third son, born of Indra, king of the demi gods (devas).The son of Indra, Arjuna is said to have been well-built and extremely handsome; he married four times, as detailed here. Arjuna was also true and loyal to his friends, among others the great warrior Satyaki and his cousin and brother-in-law, Sri Krishna. He was also sensitive and thoughtful, as demonstrated by his misgivings about the Kurukshetra war, which caused Sri Krishna to impart the Gita to him. His sense of duty was acute; he once chose to go into exile rather than refuse to help a brahmin subject.It is as a warrior that Arjuna is best known. The foundation for his career as a warrior was laid young; Arjuna learned everything that his guru Dronacharya could teach him, attaining the status of "Maharathi" or outstanding warrior. A well known story about Arjuna exemplifies his powers of concentration. Guru Dronacharya once decided to test his students in their skill of archery. He hung a wooden bird from the branch of a tree and then summoned his students. He asked the first one to aim for the bird's eye but not shoot just yet. He then asked the student what the student could see. The student replied that he could see the garden, the tree, flowers, etc. Drona asked him to step aside and not shoot. He repeated the same process with a few other students. When it was Arjuna's turn, Arjuna told his Guru that the only thing he could see was the bird's eye. This satisfied the Guru and he allowed Arjuna to shoot the bird. The lesson here is the power of focus. Arjuna once noticed his brother, Bhima, who was a voracious eater, eating in the dark as though it was daylight, and realized that if he could practice archery in the dark he would be a master.His skill in archery was to have an unlikely utility; it won him the hand of Draupadi, his first wife, the daughter of Drupada, king of Panchala. Drupada held a contest to choose a suitable match for his daughter. A wooden fish was suspended high above a reflective pool of oil; furthermore, the fish rotated. Contestants were required to string a heavy bow and then hit the eye of the rotating fish, but were allowed to aim only by looking at the fish's reflection in the pool of oil. Many princes and noblemen vied for the hand of the princess of Panchala. Some (including Karna) were disqualified on grounds of low birth. Although the Pandavas and their mother were in hiding at that time, Arjuna had dressed as a high-caste snaataka Brahmin and was allowed to compete. It was Arjuna, the peerless archer, who alone was able to accomplish the set task.    All the five Pandava brothers had attended the tournament without informing Kunti, their mother. They returned home in triumph, bringing the princess Draupadi with them. From outside the house, they called out: "Mother, you will never believe what we have got here! Make a guess!" Busy with her work, Kunti refused to be baited. "Whatever it is, share it between yourselves equally, and do not quarrel over the matter," she said. So seriously did the brothers take even this casual statement of their mother, that they resolved upon making Draupadi their common wife. It says something about the magnanimity of Arjuna that, having won his bride single-handedly, he 'shared' her with all his brothers wi

6e8af9deff7a2588bb4959771651cb16aa	After being re-instated as a Colonial Power in the region (French Indo-China), after WWII, once again they were militarily humiliated, this time by Ho Chi Minh, ending in Dien Bien Phu. The last engagement nearly resulted in the USA dropping atomic bombs on Vietnam.    DIEN BIEN PHU 1954               20 Nov 53 The French under new commander Gen. Henri Navarre begin Operation Castor, construction of a series of entrenched outposts protecting a small air base in the isolated jungle valley at Dien Bien Phu in northwest Vietnam. The French hope to draw the Viet Minh into a pitched battle. 800 French paratroopers parachute into Dien Bien Phu and begin preparations for a fortified camp, building two airstrips to link the base with Hanoi.        Gen. Giap immediately begins massing Viet Minh troops and artillery in the area, sensing the potential for a decisive blow against the French. Giap's troops manually drag 200 heavy howitzers up rugged mountain sides to target the French air base. The French, aware of Giap's intentions, mass their own troops and artillery, preparing for a showdown, but have grossly underestimated Giap's strength.     Jan 54 Operation "Atlante" begins. It is designed to clear the coastal areas of Viet Minh, but ends in March without achieving the objective.     Mar 54 The Dien Bien Phu garrison now includes a dozen battalions, two groups of 75mm guns, 28 105mm howitzers, four 155mm howitzers, mortars, and 10 light tanks. Six Grunman fighters armed with napalm are on alert on the airfield. Three main bastions form the defense of the larger airstrip, while the main stronghold includes the village itself. Four smaller outposts formed the outer defense.     13 Mar 54 50,000 Viet Minh under Gen. Giap begin their assault against the fortified hills protecting the Dien Bien Phu air base. They outnumber the French by nearly five-to-one.          Giap's artillery pounds the French and shuts down the only runway, thus forcing the French to rely on risky parachute drops for re-supply. Giap's troops then take out their shovels and begin construction of a maze of tunnels and trenches, slowly inching their way toward the main French position and surrounding it.     30 Mar -  1 May 54 The siege at Dien Bien Phu occurs as nearly 10,000 French soldiers are trapped by 45,000 Viet Minh. French troops soon run out of fresh water and medical supplies.         The French urgently appeal to Washington for help. The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff now consider three possible military options: sending American combat troops to the rescue; a massive conventional air strike by B-29 bombers; the use of tactical atomic weapons. President Eisenhower dismisses the conventional air raid and the nuclear option after getting a strong negative response to such actions from America's chief ally, Britain. Eisenhower also decides against sending U.S. ground troops to rescue the French, citing the likelihood of high casualty rates in the jungles around Dien Bien Phu. No action is taken.     7 May 54 Dien Bien Phu falls. At 5:30 p.m., 10,000 French soldiers surrender at Dien Bien Phu, depriving France of any bargaining power at Geneva. By now, an estimated 8,000 Viet Minh and 1,500 French have died.     7 May 54-  late-July 1954 French survivors are marched for up to 60 days to prison camps 500 hundred miles away. Nearly half die during the march or in captivity.     8 May 54  Dien Bien Phu Falls Before Human Avalanche      THE GENEVA CONFERENCE BEGINS 1954               8 May 54 The U.S., Britain, China, Soviet Union, France, Vietnam (Viet Minh and representatives of Bao Dai), Cambodia and Laos meet at the Geneva Conference on Indochina to negotiate a solution for Southeast Asia.|`|f9192016343611878eb18a743f6f0f5eaa	i think that it was a battle conquered by the France.|`|rsK5R2giaa	The Geneva Conference (May 8  July 21, 1954) was a conference between many countries that agreed to end hostilities and restore peace in French Indochina and Vietnam.

yWloDrF8aa	The gaf xl 112 is a Super 8 movie camera so you'll need to source Super 8 film and you'll also need to find a Super 8 Projector.  You'll find a source for an instruction manual for that camera here - http://www.craigcamera.com/ib_a.htm  If you are in the USA it will cost $18.00 plus $5.95 for shipping.  Kodak Ektachrome E160 type A is for indoor/tungsten lighting (3200K) so you will need a  85 filter when shooting outside.  Again if you are in the USA, here is a possible film processing lab for older Super 8 films - http://www.rockymountainfilm.com/ektamov...
CjPtAEzmaa	I like ones that aren't too weird and stupid. I didn't mind books like Inkheart, Harry Potter, etc. Because the people in them seemed real and were easy to relate too. I think it's fun to think outside the box and come up with new ideas, but if you get too out-there and weird it becomes un-relateable, if that's a word. XD I don't like reading about princes and princesses and stuff. I do like stuff that involves people that seem real, just set in a situation that couldn't really happen.    Edit: If you're looking for specific topics, try to steer away from vampires and werewolves for awhile. XD I think we've all had enough of that. Mermaids would be cool, along with ghosts, magic, gypsies (I realize those exist but still...you could give them qualities that don't exist), unicorns (I realize that sound dumb...but you can make it to where it's not!) or mind-control.|`|sSR0Y7Sbaa	Read 'Black Hole' available online on http://Englishnovels.net|`|ajeMVARraa	A mermaid one might be cool, considering the only mermaid story I know of is the lame Disney one...|`|5wg7tKc6aa	I like everything fantasy... when used, or made out in the right way.  Like, if an author writes about mermaids, and they've got a long, silky, beautiful tail- their breasts covered in shells, and they have big, beautiful eyes, perfect teeth, etc... that's lame.  I'd rather ready about a full body of scale-like skin, a greenish colour, with gills in the right spots, and long fingers with even longer nails- and their tails are sharp as knives, and they have sharp, jagged teeth, and dark eyes- no eye lashes, and thick, dirty hair... something different, yet worth reading about.  I'm into scary fantasy.     I don't know, maybe this helped?|`|ARjxwkHSaa	I love fantasy novels! Books like: The Dream Thief, Faerie Wars, Harry Potter, the Twilight series, The Two Princesses of Bamarre...they are all fantastic reads that I love to go through again and again. I think it's because in fantasy novels, practically anything can happen and it will be acceptable. These novels present ideas in a different way and allows freedom of the mind. My favorite genres are romance, humor, horror, adventure...ok, I like practically all of them. However, I love books that have the shocking, plot-twisting, Oh-my-god ending that you really have to think about the best. I love piquing my interest and intellect. Books that make me think and wonder about life's possibilities are the ones worth learning to read for.|`|IDTQwgBaaa	I rather see something like teen girls having magical powers and given the task of saving the world with slight (pagan) religious issues in it.

dXW9cPWMaa	Honestly, I can't get through it because it is only dialogue. You need dialogue tags and more characterization to make it legible. Even if you tell me who starts the conversation, it's too much work to keep thinking 'Ok, he said and she said and he said and etc.' Readers won't want to do that, and if you submit this, an editor especially won't.    You also need to proof your grammar because, capitalization issues aside, it's quite terrible. You need to insert proper punctuation and make sure you use actual words; for example, if you must say "cause" instead of "because," you need to place the appropriate apostrophe to make it " 'cause."    Instead of telling me that a few minutes later the man continues his discussion, show me why he stops and then why he starts again. I don't want to know that he starts talking again - I want to know why and I need to see it. You haven't given your reader anything to go on, even in such a small excerpt (I'm assuming you've put more description in other places; if not, do that).    I've seen this posted several times with similar advice given. Why don't you take someone up on it?|`|ARjxwkHSaa	Hm...you and I would have a very interesting conversation together. That was an excellent dialog, maybe not grammar wise, but its the words that count. It's very thoughtful and deep, and delves into human behavior and instincts. I liked how you posed both optimistic and pessimistic viewpoints; I like a well-rounded discussion.    I say it's an excellent piece of work. You should tell me when you finish a completed script so I can read it and think about it myself.

f4Nn0W1xaa	A manifesto, by definition, is "a public declaration of principles or intentions". I would say that the simplest and most entertaining of your options would be text messaging, though any of the others would be more interesting, not to mention challenging. You could turn a texting manifesto into a regular comedy piece though, and that might be cool too. Here are links to two extreme examples of the manifesto form.     http://gos.sbc.edu/s/solanas.html    http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/wor...    And to the wiki article on manifestos, with links to many other examples.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto    Good luck, and have some fun with it, whatever you pick. I think it's a cool project.   I'm still trying to decide what I'd choose to do. Probably literature, I guess.
eO9QCbdWaa	well if you take the Bible literally Jesus was God hence superhuman qualities. and um people dont listen to their religions. they are always asking for forgiveness from their religious teachers. they always turn away from their religion. so they arent controlled by it.|`|yuuvBSKsaa	Population control?

Don't get me wrong, it COULD be true, but yeah, so could the movie.    Jesus could have been an alien, but it seems unlikely, and I don't see how it would be, in any way, important.|`|Xz2R8R1Maa	Are you sure you weren't just watching Stargate? ;-)    Where in the world did you find this documentary?    In any case, if aliens were responsible for the world's religions (not likely), where did they go?  Why aren't they here now?    The evidence that shoots down this alien hypothesis may be found in the same way the history of languages are studied.  One of the reasons I'm an atheist today--and the sole reason why I no longer doubt my decision to reject religion--is because when I studied the history of the English language, I was involved in project involving the Mother Tongue--the language spoken by people who were the ancestors of most Western languages (there are eight Mother Tongues; ours is Indo-European).  My part of the project was the discovery of their religious language.  How do you find the religious language of a people who left behind no written record?  You find the words the most ancient languages have in common, then extrapolate.    What I found about the world's ancient religions was that the closer the people were geographically, the closer their religions became.  There was a progression of difference between religions that corresponded with migrations.      The Hebrew religion was no exception.  Before the religion became monotheistic, there was very little difference between it and other religions of the time and region; after it became monotheistic, the monotheism was the only real difference.  One god replaced the pantheon.     Jesus was a myth, like any other character with supernatural powers--and was a conglomeration of several other myths of the period.|`|WyK0hgV3aa	Go read the bible, go read the Quraan and stop watching TV.  Educate yourself on what matters in this universe|`|AA11341087	No, I do not believe that Jesus was an alien, legal, illegal, or extraterrestrial.    Jesus was a great teacher, with a new way to explain an old message. His believers did not want to give up that message and so helped explain it using "supernatural" means.

SEE, all the yahooligans thumb down at suggestions to twilight>|`|n7hezV5aaa	Pfffffff....The book obviously....duh....I think the movie was a really brief (and bad) summary of the book|`|5iMja1Meaa	Book is waaay better as it has more detail but I still love the movie :)|`|FBMDK4lHaa	u have to watch it as well it gives u a picture of the characters when u read the next books go see it even if its just to watch rob!|`|w0ZGxfJJaa	Book,|`|Q4qghst7aa	definitely the book, as it is amaaazing  but i really liked the movie too  just go into the cinema and forget all about the book, view it with an open mind ad youll love it (:  (the soundtrack's awesome)|`|OedbpoJvaa	the movie was good...but nothing is as good as the book|`|YLcBsYYraa	the book is sooooo much better. Every 5 minutes my friend and I could point out something wrong or that they didn't include. And everybody knows that a book is always better than the movie.|`|jVW32D0jaa	i liked the movie best because it was more intense, i guess i'm more into visual things...    but it got on my nerves that they missed out carlisle's story    meh :)|`|Y0ffbZKraa	Twilight the book or Twilight the movie.... I think I'll take a shotgun instead.|`|aMm7vOWnaa	The book is deffinetley more action packed.  The movie is still great but if your looking for tons of excitment and such the book is far better :)|`|Mt1b8dKsaa	The book, of course! In order to make the movie, they have to cut a lot of good parts out.|`|HhW5lf8Daa	The book is always better than the movie because the book is more in detail (since it's long the movie can't fit 500 or so pages in one movie, it's not possible so they have to remove/change things which isn't always the best.) Also the book is the original one, then comes the movie.   Watch the movie anyways if you're fan. You have nothing to lose for it I guess.|`|ZW24GerXaa	I would say the book is better. it explains everything such as emotions, and events in detail. the movie leaves out a lot, and adds some things in it too. i was mad wen it came to the prom scene because she knew edward was taking her to the prom, but in the book she never knew. the book is way better. the movie was okay, but the movie was two hours long and could have included more. especially the chapter about the Cullens. it also explained a little about the volturi in that chapter which is also important for the second book and movie, but the movie failed to include that as well. however, i did think that the baseball and fight with james was good. if u want to see the movie (though it shows up dark) then go to this site, and see which u like better.     http://watch-movies.net/movies/twilight/    I hope this helps, and if u watch the movie, then enjoy!
FD8I4zthaa	A monologue is a speech by one person to no-one in particular, So yes.|`|bF4HAvsZaa	Since you asked:  This little monologue has no meaning at all. It lacks dramatic tension, irony or humor. It is confusing and has no point. As a school essay, it is C- work. As a monologue to be used as a performance piece, it is unacceptable.    The 2 opening sentences do not ask the same question. Which one are you planning to answer?  Never write, "Well, I will tell you."  Tell us!  You can't use "firstly" without a "secondly."  "But when you are there..." When you are where?  "Well, that says it all..."  That doesn't say anything. What are you talking about?  Never write "This, I have to say, is how I feel."  Tell us how you feel!  "...I know there are others out there..." Other what? Other people? Other people who are horrified? Other people who have to say how they feel? What are you talking about?    "...I'm not the only one to feel like this..." Feel like what?    "I'm not talking about transvestite..." Do you mean, "I'm not saying that I'm a transvestite"? A transvestite is a heterosexual man who receives sexual satisfaction from wearing women's clothing. If that's not what you are, fine. Is this the word you meant to use? If your gender identification or sexual orientation or kinkiness is not the issue, why are you bringing it up? If it is the issue, why aren't you talking about it? You are probably also not a deep sea diver, but you don't say, "I'm not talking about deep sea diving."     "Or anything like that"?  Well, ok. You're not talking about transvestitism 'or anything like that'. Then what ARE you talking about?  So far, you aren't talking about anything.    "I'm just saying that I'm losing myself...". If you are losing yourself, tell us about that. Or better yet, show us.  "I can't find a way out." A way out of what?     "i'm pathetic."  Is this the point of the monologue? That you're pathetic? If so, why did you wait until now to start talking about it?    "What have I done with my life? Absolutely nothing. I don't even have a social life. You know something. You are all lucky. You have no idea how much...."  This is not an ending to anything. Nor does it tell us about your feelings of being pathetic.  If you want to tell us about being pathetic, do so. Do not spend 3/4 of the writing telling us what you aren't talking about.    Let's review:  This writing has no beginning, middle or end. Nor does it have any human interest, interesting words or phrases, emotional depth, dramatic tension or anything else that would bring in the listener.    This is the ramblings of an adolescent who feels confused, misunderstood, unhappy (possibly in his or her body), and thinks everyone else is happier. (They aren't, sweetie)    If you need a monologue for a performance, Google some monologues from real plays. If you need to write one yourself, please spend some time with an acting teacher or English teacher who can help you write something.    I hope I wasn't too harsh in my criticism. By the way, life gets better as you get older. You'll feel calmer, more secure and more confident. Hang in there!|`|v3sKww6daa	i think it's good yeh.  good luck   hope this helps|`|pA8odCpuaa	If you want to to know if it's a monologue, the answer is yes. If by asking that question you want to know if it's a good one, I would have to say it's okay. It's a little short if you're planning on taking it to competition. It kind of seems like you didn't put enough time into it. Try deepening it and making it more heartfelt.|`|0wKe8qYUaa	Yes, it is a monologue, but if you want it to be top-notch, then I would suggest that you make it longer and more interesting, captivating, and grab the audiences' attention! This way, you'll get top marks!    Hope this helps!
gKfIx8Uzaa	Personally I would use PNG uncompressed for a card, JPG uses loosy compression and loses quality|`|xcw4EBalaa	Yes. JPG is the most commonly used.|`|AA11296247	JPEG by default uses compression. A lot depends on the size of the print and who is printing them. For best quality you can go with a much larger uncompressed TIFF, but only if the printer does takes them.     If your card is not bigger than 5x7 than just send it as a jpg, but save it at the highest quality (12 in photoshop). Do a Save as NOT a save for web.    Also, make sure you have it at least at 150 if not better at 300 dpi (dots per inch or pixels per inch) resolution.    Better the original quality - better the print quality
0l98mcf3aa	You want my honest opinion? You REALLY want my honest opinion?  No, you probably don't want my honest opinion. But here it is anyway:  That excerpt is, quite frankly, crap. It probably took about a minute and a half to write and you expect a glowing critique of it.   It's not well written, it's badly punctuated, the dialogue is not natural, your spelling is suspect (for example, blonde refers to a female; the male equivalent is blond), and I think your career lies elsewhere. It's not a good start, but don't start again. Let it lie where it fell.  Contrary to the popular opinion of teenagers, writing is not a breeze; it has to be worked at. Just stringing innocuous words into a sentence may appear to you as writing, but you'll never be a writer.   Have you considered a job in the civil service?|`|irPhrsGraa	It seems like you did it in a rush. Maybe plan more. Use mind maps, highlighters, and a whole lotta lists and you'll be fine.|`|ajeMVARraa	Not to be mean..... But nothing about this "story" flows. It's not written well. I don't want to read this story with the way you have it right now. Maybe work on your sentence structure and "voice".|`|7fD8nUHYaa	It's okay. Wording could be better, and you definitely need someone to edit the part. More details would be very much appreciated, such as character and scene description.|`|RrB51Mq4aa	I don't know as a story as there is no way to tell what it is about but as a showcase of writing capability it requires a lot of work. I think if you started to read a lot more you'd learn grammar faster, the way to construct it in a literary manner.    "Hurry up,Ellie,Carl is waiting for us remember!"    Should be changed to something like this,    'Hurry up Ellie! Carl is waiting for us remember!"    And you're mixing up the street talk and polite talk, you're obviously going for school-yard talk,    "I will be right there babes, just go and I will catch you up!"    Sounds more credible as,    "I'll be right there babes, just go on and I'll catch you up!"    Hope this helps|`|70266aa4d3e1b7d987168b83ae1804aaaa	I would agree with Lee H, on the grammar; and it is a little short and vague.  I would also, say " she looked as though she was staring into space", following that with, maybe you starting to walking of and turning to see the reason for the dewy look, the latest boyfriend.  But i wouldn't have him "appear from nowhere", it makes the reader think he's going to do something a little more sinister than kiss her.  But if it's a teenage romance, keep at it, just pad it more.|`|rW2dyXnraa	That was confusing. It is like you shoved three paragraphs into one! Just start over.|`|8NqQvOqQaa	its okay  but you probably have to put more detail into it  depends what this is for aswell   if your going to get graded on it then you really should put more work into it  its a little bit muddled.  appart from that, its an okay start.|`|ARjxwkHSaa	All righty then, your personal beta reader is here!     First, lets look at the story/plotline. In the second paragraph, I think you should put a little bit more information between Ellie looking into space, and her boyfriend showing up. It seems a bit abrupt, run-together, and jumpy. Take things slow with detail, and people can follow it easier.    Also, use a few more nouns and adjectives, be really detailed and specific! For example, the way Ellie was staring into space; was it dreamy, or distant and sad, or apathetic? If you're clear on the character's emotions, that will also help with the flow of the story.    Last but not least, grammar is a biggie. Watch your spaces. Delete the comma after called, and put a period after gates. Delete "where" and instead say: " I knew that Carl, one of our best friends, would be bored and waiting for us there."    Put a comma after "babe" in the last line.     And I think we're done! It was a pretty good start! Keep writing, and remember to keep asking for opinions...other points of views are extremely helpful in writing.|`|0DQeE3anaa	Would have to agree with many of the points made in the above answer sorry, but don't buy into that "you'll never make it as a writer" rubbish.      Writing is an art, and like any art it takes time and patience to perfect.  If you seek enough advice and keep practising, you'll almost certainly improve.

Agents represent people who are already actors. You should be concentrating on getting acting experience in school plays and so on.  Agents do not charge, but you have to pay for photos and printing when you get one.|`|S01zIagOaa	No matter where you pursue the industry, Toronto, Miami, Los Angeles, you do not pay agents up front for representation. Agents generally make 10% on your income when you work or when you book a job.     For this reason it is exceedingly difficult for a new actor with no resume to get the attention of agents to begin with. They have no chance of making money if they don't book work and without a strong or at least promising resume, casting directors are unlikely to pull them in for auditions.     To gain experience or start your career you need to either involve yourself in theater at your school or in your community. It goes without saying that you should also start training with acting classes or a coach. As well you should do more (like visit a bookstore) to research the business of being a working actor than simply trying to look up agents who are already swamped with seasoned and unemployed talent.
DHGC7BXQaa	Do you mean this Jennifer Taylor?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_Taylor
gt6Qp9Asaa	Hi there,    There are a few different options that you have depending on your personal preference and your bra size.    First of all, what kind of leo do you have?  If it's a tank leo (usually high neck and back, thick straps, the standard leo), you will be able to get away with a regular bar due to the high back and thick straps.    If it's a spaghetti, camisole, halter, or any other style leo (usually low back, thin straps, more 'pretty' looking), then you will either need...    1. A nude/clear bra. These bras, though not very supportive, have some padding and at the very least will not let anything show. They usually are nude on the cups, and have clear straps and sometimes a clear back. I have one and find it very useful!  OR...  2. Go bra-less. Depending on how 'big' you are, and depending on how thick your leo is, you could go bra-less. But make sure that you try it at home first...That would be embarrassing in ballet now wouldn't it?    Basically, everyone else in ballet deals with this. I'm 14 and girls are still worried. The thing is, most ballet teachers realize it's hard for girls and are understanding.     Another thing you might be worrying about is underwear. Do you wear it or do you not? I suggest definitely to wear it, but to buy a thong. I know...not the most glamorous. But after you get used to the whole 'a thong is a permanent wedgie' thing, they are quite comfortable and the best for leos! Again, girls my age sometimes don't wear them because they find them uncomfortable, but then they always are picking wedgies and pulling up their underwear and down their leo. If your Mom doesn't want you wearing it (which is very understanding at age 11) ask her if she's ok with high cut/medium coverage undies. These will not work as well, but will work 100 times better than regular undies. Here are some examples of higher cut/medium coverage undies, also known as Tangas & Cheekys:  -http://www.ae.com/aerie/browse/product.j...  -http://www.ae.com/aerie/browse/product.j...  -http://www.ae.com/aerie/browse/product.j...  (Unfortunately, most have lace).    There are also the two-string bikinis. These have medium coverage but only have a thin string along the sides. This will work very well with a high cut leo! Here are some examples:  -http://www.ae.com/aerie/browse/product.j...  -http://www.ae.com/aerie/browse/product.j...  -http://www.ae.com/aerie/browse/product.j...    I really hope this helps, good luck with ballet!    :)|`|7rQDuCDlaa	I always do. I don't have very much chest endowment, but I like it to stay where it is. Bouncing around in a braless leotard is NOT something I have ever enjoyed.|`|Lq9Q1rAgaa	maybe a sports bra or something like that would help cos ya dnt want any1 seeing anything lol    xxx|`|hcSBEPiZaa	no just a sports bra :)|`|F2jJu5CMaa	It depends on the type of leotard.  If the leotard is lycra, like swimsuit type material, then you should wear a bra. Preferably flesh cloured as dance teachers aren't too fond of people wearing bra's and so this would be less noticeable.  You can also get leotards that have a bra included in them, which you can get from dance direct or somewhere like that.   Hope I helped. (:|`|TDoaS6suaa	Most leotards are made with built-in support. What I suggest doing is to try on your leotard at home before you start your classes and just jump around in it. If you feel uncomfortably or unsupported then you can wear a sports bra underneath, but it might show a bit. :)|`|SrTY4lrDaa	I Do! Yes most girls do if they have ****! If ya do then yer, defiantly!|`|WIpeC3gRaa	Well, I wear one just for the pure reason that I'm not comfortable with the size of my boobs. It really depends on where you go, some will let you and some will not. Seeing as you're only 11, you might want to opt for a leotard that's built for your age like the one here: http://www.dancedistributors.com/leotard...|`|I6JoE4CGaa	i'm straight|`|Gox4ol8Zaa	if you are quite flatchested then you don't really need to..if you arn'y then wear a sportsbra. You can't really see through the leotards, don't worry..  and i think its bad to wear a proper bra....i tried that once (i do gymnastics) and it was really painful and aslo made me look slutty...lol...and you could see it though, but you can't see sports bras...|`|m33uUyRYaa	yes wear a bra just a normal one is fine
JlVvAkXSaa	His style!  I love analytic philosophy, the clear stuff.  Nietzsche's ramblings made my head hurt.  If he would have been clear in his writing, I may have enjoyed him much more.|`|iK7UcU7Uaa	I actually love his philosophy, he was brilliant. I do disagree with some of his views- some of the things he said about women and his views on education, for example- but overall he really made me think and look at things in a completely new way. He was very unique and insightful.|`|yuuvBSKsaa	I don't think he ever made it beyond good & evil.    Hate though would be too strong a word.  I reserve that for philosophers that make wild @ss statements with no basis in observable reality.  E.g. Plato.|`|K6KeN7sgaa	He was in love with his sister.        ewwwwwww|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	Nothing.  He was brilliant.  A bit arrogant to be sure, but justified.|`|c95d0302c2211652aacf54a2a7f7550caa	Nothing.....but he did go mad.|`|ZtGEyNJVaa	soooo... Fenex hates Playdo...|`|AA11301302	I hate that he hated Jesus Christ, who is and was the most loving, compassionate, and truthful person who ever walked the face of the earth. He is also the Savior of mankind -- so how dare a mere mortal like Nietzsche think he could try to discredit Jesus and call himself "the antichrist?!"|`|1gjWcF4gaa	I strongly disagree with Nietzsche's opinions on religion, and probably with the rest of his philosophy as well. I think his "ubermensch" views, while logically sound, have horrible implications. I share the belief that the best rebuttal came not from another philosopher, but from Fyodor Dostoevsky (Crime and Punishment)
AA12255473	you know I'm not a fan of free rhyme, or whatever these newfangled poems are called,  I'm kind of a traditionalist, but I liked your poem.  I think it was way way better than the one from the inauguration.... gosh that one nearly put me to sleep.    this was short, sweet and to the point, and it did evoke some emotions.  That's what art is.  messing with people's emotions.    I liked the sunset analogy.  I think the sun is about to set in my life too... will probably going through some tough times with health, economy, etc.etc... and having someone there for you makes all the difference.|`|0BioKSmaaa	I think the thing that makes this poem so moving is its simplicity, the sunset metaphor is clear to anyone who will try to read & think abt it..I also liked the touch you added to it with the structure..it definitely adds to the solemn tone of the piece...excellently done :)|`|Cs2pDMbeaa	depressing but profound i have to say|`|oGzS4vhNaa	This is such a great poem...I really like it....

Your point may be to allow the reader to devise an ending for themselves.  That may not be a bad idea, but I would like to what happens to the person in the poem.|`|BRIeyc8Raa	this is so deep and touching. a lot of feeling. good job. the sunset idea is definitely working.|`|A3JuXq8taa	yes I get the sunset thing this might be blunt but this poem screams teenage drama|`|QAN5OxWIaa	i liked it..it was something pretty easy to understand and connect to...good job!!

w13Zbnk7aa	1) Steam engines were inefficient and rare outside of coal mines.  2) Europeans didn't have any advantages based on their production. They even seemed to lag behind their Asian counterparts. China produced luxuries that were desired by westerners, but except for gold and silver, China wanted no part in trading with Europe. Intellectual tradition and politics seem to explain the early industrialization as well as the rise of commerce, distinguishing Britain economically. Commerce was not encouraged in Asia because the merchants were set in a lower class.   3) Westerners became addicted to buying low and selling high.   4) Britain was Europe's leading commercial and colonial power. It's colonies established commercial connections.   5) Britain's efficient economy gave Britain no trouble with exportation.  6)considerable access to expanding markets (population boom with wealthy people).

6uLDFq9Aaa	You should go on the street, or any public transportation, then listen to a strangers conversastion. Write down one line, then go home and base a story after that line, without knowing the real situation.|`|2D1uxlUfaa	simple. you weren't destined to write, you can't progress. make the plot more secure and detailed,|`|ajeMVARraa	What's the plot/idea? Just in a general sense. I'm not trying to steal your ideas. It's just hard to start a story or give you ideas if I have nothing to go on.|`|sq2V4PzIaa	I usually just write down a lot of ideas then make them into scenes xD Random thoughts from my head ;P    Good luck xD|`|ARjxwkHSaa	When I get writer's block, much like the same way you do, I try to connect my main ideas together and find filler stuff to do the job. Try brainstorming a lot...think realistically, like: "What would this character really do in this situation?" or something like that. Also, get inspiration by reading segments from other books. Starting a story is always the hardest part, when our main ideas are usually the climax and important events, right? I get what you mean. Just try to throw in some filler stuff, that might help.|`|RrB51Mq4aa	Don't try so hard, just let it flow. It's kind of like having to give a urine sample at the doctors and you don't really need to go and you start trying, pushing and your getting not a drop. The trick is to just stop trying and start typing, don't stop even if its nonsense, your mind will soon relax and your imagination will take a leak and tadaa you'll have words that mean something, then delete the crap and just enjoy writing again.|`|q1xFtNWwaa	If you're typing it, turn off your computer screen. That's what I do when I get blocked, so I don't self-edit as I go!    Otherwise, maybe you can write different scenes, or even just parts of scenes - little lines of dialogue, character descriptions or setting descriptions you think you'll use later on... It might help you get started just to keep everything creative and not worry about putting things in order right away.    Or you could tell yourself you're not going to write for three days. (This is dangerous, but it works for me! lol) If you love writing, you'll be dying to break your own rule and write sooner than that!    Good luck!|`|IIETaUlVaa	Try writing a brief outline or synopsis of your idea. It will help remind you where you want to go with your story. Then, think about writing in terms of putting one foot in front of the other. You write two sentences to, what, introduce your character? Take them someplace, make them walk into a room or eat a meal or play a game or meet someone else. Will this be wonderful, magical prose? Probably not, but it will get you to the part of the story where it picks up again. After you've written "The End" you can go back and edit those parts you wrote to get you through your blockage. Who knows - they may be good, too.
RfOLqUKlaa	But apart from better sanitation and medicine and education and irrigation and public health and roads and a freshwater system and baths and public order... what have the Romans done for us?|`|qpxPW5paaa	By the standards of the times, yes.|`|AA10729675	Yes.  But so were the Barbarians.  You see, all Barbarians were not Barbaric!  They had their own form of civilization.  The concept of civilization is large and elastic.  It depends on what we mean by civilization and civilized.  The Romans had their form of civilization.  At first, they were no so, though.  They got to be educated and refined by the Greeks.  And even with that, some Historians think that on many points the so-called "Barbarians" were more civilized than the Romans.  As for the Greeks, they called 'Barbarian' any type of population or individual who did not speak Greek.  So did the Romans.  However, Goths, Vizigoths, Ostrogoths, Vandals, Franks, were all Barbarians with barbarian ways, especially compared to the Romans who had a very refined infra-structure (roads, aqueducts, heating systems for baths, and for houses, bridges, palaces, etc.)    The Romans, having conquered so many civilized countries had of course 'borrowed' (plundered, demanded, snatched away) the refinements of all those countries, their architects and engineers, physicians, astrologists, educators, philosophers, texts, etc.).  So they had the very best at their disposal.    Did this help?|`|UYIanZIpaa	Do I look civilized?|`|aD7kHTJNaa	civilized*  YEs they were. I was a latin major (their language). THey were not barbarians. they had a government system, shops, they ran like a modern day america-but htey had slaves who would do things for them but their slaves were the same race as them.  They has summer  homes off of the Appian Way. The were just fine-the Roman Empire was so HUGE that the sun never set on it. Alexander the great might nto have been civilized but that is another story. YES THEY WERE CIVILIZED! haha.|`|NmV5XWlJaa	Depends what you mean by civilized. There was a Roman civilization, and historians consider it the most advanced of its time. They did things that were barbaric by our standards, like feeding the Christians to the lions. And then they were more refined than we are today in other areas, such as including the Greek philosophers and poets in their entertainment.|`|7h6gj8BUaa	Yes they ate Pineapples|`|T7Mb8deyaa	That depends on if you think Americans today are civilized. If they are, then the Romans were civilized, too. They were modern- they had aquiducts, and they aslo had graffitti, and curse words. Look it up.|`|da8zv4hvaa	Haha depends on what you think civilized is? Sorry for answering a question with a question. :]
jSTy7E4Maa	This is really an interesting question.  OK let me tell you what I think.  First of all I do not know what will be the purpose of the painting and if you would liek to keep it afterwards, but I will try to answer considering all possibilities.   ACRYL: I woulds say that it depends on weather. Acry is pretty durable, but if the canvas/clote which is it surface stays wet for longer time, then it may happen that the gesso and /or the paint surface peels of. (The best way of taking of acryl stains from your cloths is to keep is soaked long time in water). As South of France might be pretty dry and sunny, youo may choose acryl paint, but i would still suggest to apply thin layers of paint , to avoid cracking of the paint and maybe but acryl varnish on both sides of teh canvas.  OIL: Oil is a pretty flexable and durable paint. It does not fade under sun and is mostly waterproof. If the weather will be rainy, then I suggest using oil based gesso, which ismore flexable and more waterprroof. Use thin layers of paint to avoid cracking if the painting is exposed to wind or if someone punches it by chance...Use varnish too, to protect the surface of painting.  TEXTILE PAINT/SILK PAINT: is good as then you will not need to strech your canvas and the layers of paint are thin. Naturally the efects of these paints  are diffeent from acryl and oil. You may choose a paint used for Tshirts, which you can even wash in washing machine (it is thus waterproof, flexable and pprobably will survive 2 months withour much problems - but might not be a solution I would choose if I want to keep the painting after those 2 months).   For all paint the viewing and the material of the textile is very important. use ONLY natural fiber (cotton, linen, silk), and never mixed fibers (syntetic, or mixture of natural materials). Different natural fibers react differently (strech, shrink) depending on the air condition, humidity, dryness, air pressure...so if the fiber is of same material, it always streches the same way on all canvase. Viewing of the textali you use should be the simplest one, no paterns, no diagonal lines (like on jeans), just treads crossed in 90 degrees.   DO use GESSO. Apply it in few thin layers to provide flexibility of canvas and more chance that the paint stays on the surface.    huh! I really got long....but I have one more tip:     TEST:  no matter what advice you accept here, and  if you have chance to do it, make tests. Since your work is large and I guess it is important for you to make it sure you will not make a mistake. Maybe make few smaller canvases painted with the techniques you think that might be ok, and expose them to the outdore enviromnment, similar to the one you will have in France...well naturally all this if youo are able to do it. You will see how your test peaces react to the weather conditions.    OK this was my answer. In case you have questions please feel free to contact me by email.      I hope I helped you.|`|5b2cd89e5940076781e52d9c63b944d1aa	In principle oil painting cannot be diluted with water, so there should be no problem.

The ultimate battle which continues today is over the minds of the people.  As long as people are subject to earthly rulers, beit the Pope, the King or, government, it is believed by the rulers, that they can control the way the people believe and think and more easily control the people.  The problem is people, ultimately, in times of desperate need, turn to God because the Pope, King, or government only appear after the fact, i.e., after the wreck, robbery, rape, etc..  This was the reason or  attempt under our constitution to seperate chruch and state and leave the people sovereign under God.  But, as usual, both church and state are still in a battle over the minds of the people to this day.  This is the source of wars.

c8JryKZTaa	It is easy to see that people are addicted to conflict and that some of us will have a rough time kicking the habit.  Speaking of kicking, there are some posters who need a swift kick (You know where) just to give them a bit of incentive to be less negative, competitive and rigid in their views.      Couldn't we all just agree on a few small things for one day???  Wouldn't a nice new barbecue bring a nice smile to your face?    Don't you think that people in Iran, Russia, Gaza, Iraq, and France would be green with envy if they saw Americans agreeing with one another?  Wouldn't people in those areas begin to try harder to create a more cooperative world and be less of a pain in the neck???    Better to light a small barbecue than to curse the darkness.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	I disagree; it would never work.|`|GpPclegDaa	The problem with compromise is that it isn't always a good thing.    Hypothetically speaking, let us say that one group of people eats another groups babies. The leaders of each group come together and agree, in the spirit of compromise, that the baby-eaters will eat fewer babies per annum.     Obviously that's not good enough. This is a pretty reasonable thing to fight about.    That said, rewarding large NUMBERS of compromises is a terrible idea. People will "play the system," falsifying issues to compromise on, make poor decisions, and generally sacrifice quality to produce quantity.     The ultimate goal is overall quality of life and connectedness to one's community, and focusing on anything else would be foolish.    Personally, I strongly believe in conflict as a solution, not a problem. Blanket aversion to conflict is lack of conviction and often cowardice    EDIT: I see what you mean. Indeed, it does still require courage to put back one's objections long enough to actually comprehend another's stance.     However, it is necessary that people actually hold a stance, and when there is apparent conflict, that those stances gradually be better defined. Often I realize in argument, that both I and my opponent have the same essential belief, but different descriptions of it.  Or, if I am swayed by a superior understanding, I find that my stance was defeated. In either case, the resolution came about by conflict, not compromise.     Compromise usually requires a meeting halfway, a sense that both sides are valid, and therefore a giving up on both sides for the sake of peace. This, I view as cowardice.    Rather, it seems that there is a "correct" or "Ideal" solution to every apparent conflict, and that such a thing can only be properly reached through conflict. It is generally best that this conflict be peaceful, but sometimes that is not a possibility.    In response to your original proposal, I would suggest that rather than rewarding compromise for its own sake, we try this with humility instead. It could be called "Not Being a Fatheaded Douche" for the state that does the fewest fatheaded and douchey things in the space of a year.    There, do we agree yet?|`|4xsAQBZuaa	Are you searching for Camelot?  I think you are going to have to rethink it and go even smaller in baby steps, start with schools, bowling allies, bars, fire departments, libraries, go small to go big.  If you can get these people to cooperate then you can work on their towns, then cities, then states, then a nation, then jump to another nation, start small and do it all over again.  You can't worry about what is going on in someone else's backyard unless your backyard is ship shape, how does your backyard look?  Are you practicing what you preach?  If so then it is time for you to slowly expand out word and who knows where you will get.  Maybe someday we won't have a need for World Cooperation Day because they will already be doing it.  Or we could put them all in a tiny room and let them duke it out, winner takes all!!!|`|AA10246871	That sounds splendid, but could we modify it slightly? I'd feel better about it if it were National Agree with Bronwen Day...and Hemp, of course, as long as you get with me first, and you and I can iron out what things we will be agreeing on, so we can then provide others with an idea of what they will, in turn, be agreeing with :)    Realistically, I think an Agreement Day would be too hard for people. Some people have been fighting the toilet seat up--toilet seat down battle for too long to be willing to reach an armistice on the issue, even for one day. That might result in a lack of participation. What you need, if you're going to sell this idea, is a name which fools people into thinking that they will not be doing anything even slightly uncomfortable or difficult. After considerable thought (and for me, three minutes IS considerable thought), may I humbly suggest a Do What It Says In Your Fortune Cookie Day? Then, you can have every fortune cookie in the country (or world, if you aim really high) say, "Reach an agreement or compromise with every person you meet today."    You'll have to do some planning to get the fortune cookies out. People cannot agree on where to have lunch, and if they agree on Chinese, they have a hard time agreeing on which Chinese restaurant, so I just suggest houses be mailed packages of fortune cookies, and that big bowls be set out on all street corners, at all schools and office buildings, and at the bases of power poles out in the middle of nowhere. (You can probably skip government buildings--that's asking a bit much.) You can also have planes drop big loads of fortune cookies over, well, everywhere. Just get the cookies out there.     I guess my point is that you've got to deliver it in a fun way, where people don't know they are actually doing something constructive. If they think they might actually be, well, working with others, they will balk. So you've got to disguise it as something fun and beneficial for them. Make it something desirable and something they can't resist. Think about it. Who can resist a fortune cookie?|`|AA12257113	Yes.    But how would we ever agree as to the day!|`|hCaotAlCaa	I'm OK with your idea, but I would prefer to see a National Yahoo Answers Spelling Day.  Some independent grader would evaluate the spelling of all responses, and decide which state had the highest percentage of correctly spelled questions and answers.  Then THEY get the free barbecue - but not the people who can't spell.    This would address a truly critical issue, that of the semi-literacy of many Y!A participants.      Then, once we get that done, maybe in conjunction with your National Agreement Day, we could also have a National Politeness Day!
CKRfaRYvaa	It's too long for me to cut and paste for you, but here's where I found it.  Go to amazon.com and enter Norton Reader 12th in the search box.  One of the first entries that it pulls up is the book you want, and the entry should have a 'look inside' label on the pic.  Click on the entry, and once it opens up, click on the big picture of the book with the 'look inside' label.  One of the sections that you can look at is the table of contents.
AA12339318	Yes, to both.    But when accuracy is critical, I ALWAYS use, either a live, or photographic reference.  Even my fantasy illustrations will usually be bases on some realistic reference.  If I have a client that wants a rabbit wearing a raincoat, I will make sure the bunny LOOKS like a real rabbit because I am creating the bunny parts while looking at several photos of bunnies.    That way, my rabbits are believable, whether on their hind legs wearing coats, or sitting at a table, or flying airplanes.    Don't get me wrong.  I can do a pretty pasable rabbit without the references.  Most of my cartoon images are done off the top of my head.  But the only reason I can do this is because of my constant and ongoing PRACTICE, sketching from real life and from photos.    It's great that you can draw from imagination, but, if you expect to turn pro, at some point, you'll get a client that wants something done that you haven't done before.  If he wants a Percheron, and you give him a Clydesdale, or worse, a Shetland, he'll KNOW, and you won't get paid.|`|dStq2JKyaa	at the beginning i would always use a reference, but the more you draw, the more you understand perspective and values and usually you will be able to draw anything... but it takes a while|`|HBx6q05Oaa	I do both, if I am just doodling, I draw out of ny head. If I'm doing a particular landscape or such, then I draw it then, or take a picture and sketch it later|`|GeHrKxThaa	I always use references, even if I have to use several to make a single drawing, but I use my own photos whenever I can. I draw photorealistic animals so I need to see the very fine details. I can't do that in my head yet.|`|XzEGvaXjaa	I do both because sometimes the image I see in my head is clear enough where I don't really need a reference or any reference I find won't be exact enough and sometimes the image is vague so a reference can help me refine it.    But in all pictures I draw, I do reference SOMETHING no matter how small it is. Whether it be the position of a hand or how to draw a toe. Small, insignificant things that you can easily find the exact position you're looking for.

It sounds good so far and it's sooo realistic! :-)|`|AHuBqplbaa	Take or leave the opinion of course - I do like the idea of the character and would certainly read about him, but so far it's just a dump of information.  Fast forward to where some action happens and start there. All of this stuff, which can be interesting, would be better distributed through the story when it matters.|`|BqrQFLH5aa	yes i like it    Can i read the rest, pretty please?|`|MTJs95Emaa	Thats so awesome! The intro is really catching!|`|2kHQ3Icnaa	That's really good. Two thumbs up.|`|dTOiazUpaa	yes i love it! its very good! i reminds me a book that i cant think of right now. your a great writer! you should continue writing this!|`|KHNBcsdkaa	Wow, that's actually pretty good. You have a flair for writing! When you write your story, a good idea is to try and think about the way a teenager would talk in real life (it sounds like that's who's narrating) and word things like that, but don't make it too confusing. Also, try replacing the phrase "That's their group name and I am part of them" with something like "That's what their group is called, and I am part of it." Just to have it make a bit more sense. But other than that, it's actually fantastic, it looks like it will turn out to be a really good story! It really makes you want to read on.
7VpDEkC6aa	Relax......it will get better.  You just freaked out your vocal chords a little doing that stuff.  Try not to talk too much today or for half a day and you'll be fine tomorrow.    When I was doing theater, after a full week of dress rehearsals every day, our voices would crack, too, because of over use and strain.  We used Chloraseptic throat spray  as a temporary fix. It  numbs your throat up a little so you don't feel the pain and you sing anyway. Your voice is cracking because it hurts and you hold back a bit.    Don't worry, you're not damaged for life. (But stop doing that!!  LOL)|`|bFjucnsmaa	wait did i answer ur q before?
xV3rBGWzaa	Hi, I have the reader you want now and I love it.l  I too saw the Kindle on Oprah and wanted one.  I never even heard of readers and was going to get one later but I guess my daughter heard me and told my husband and he got me the Sony because we always shop Sony.      The big thing that the Kindle pushes is its wireless technology so you can order your books from anywhere wirelessly at any time.  Well the Sony works just like I tunes.  You install the program once in  minutes.  You click on the icon on your desktop, the program opens,   then from there you click on  the  ebookstore and u search by category, author, price, etc.  Then you just add to your cart, then checkout, then put in your credit card/debit card/gift card info  (it saves this for the next time you shop) and you push download.  I downloaded 10 books in 2 minnutes.  You just hook the USB to the reader and your computer and you just go to your library in the program and drag the books you bought to the reader.  It holds 160 books and there is a memory slot to hold so many more.  So if I have 300 books on there I highly doubt I am going to run out during vacation and it would be pretty rare I  need a book in an emergency so I dont think I need the wi fi function of the Kindle.      The sony reader comes with a great case and it is very thin.  It comes with 100 free classic books.  You is also an MP3, great for the gym.  The battery lasts 7500 pages and you can charge it by simply connecting the usb to it and your computer.  You dont have to go on any program it just charges like that.  So when I am surfing the net I will hook it up and not even notice it is charging but you dont have to do that often.  It does not come with a book light but most readers wont because they drain the battery.  I bought a cheap one for 4 bucks for in the care.  It is really easy on the eyes.  You bookmark your pages so when you turn it on it saves your place.  The directions are downloaded right onto it.  It also supports other formatis like PDF.    Also, please note that there are many ebook sites to buy books from, not just sony just make sure they support the format for the reader.  Note, look up legal site because there are streamling sites where people share the books they got but this illegal copyright just like stealing songs.  I like going on the computer to buy my books anyway because I can look at the whole screen to see what I am doing and read about the books.  They have lots of sales at the sony book store and publishes give away free books every once in a while to introduce you to their books and they sell book bundles and many really cheap books.  I have read reviews where people say the screen turns black as you turn pages but it is like for a split second, I mean by the time you push the button to turn the page it is done so you dont even notice it it is so fast.  There are 3 sizes of font too.      I love mine and it is 150 less than kindle.      I got the silver one as a gift but I love the red one better!

fI4LqMVMaa	fiction.  He lied about it at first and said it was true, until it was revealed through various sources that he lied about a lot of the details and made up several things.  It was a big deal because oprah had him on her show and when they first accused him of lying she defended him.  When it came out that he really did lie, it was embarassing for her.  So she had him back on the show and basically called him out (she was really angry)   So yes, what you heard is true, while some parts are true others are exagerated or made up entirely.|`|TPBfzLqjaa	Is this the book that Oprah featured on her show and it turn out to be written by someone else as a fake story.|`|Xkas9BG2aa	It's a story about drug addiction, and anyone who has been a former drug addict or in the field of recovery will tell you that drug addicts have a hard time being honest...even after being free of drugs.  So even though at the time he wrote the book it was considered nonfiction, it was later said that certain things in the book weren't true and were falsified.  I'm at my local library and just checked to see how they classify the book...and it's still classified under NonFiction.
FSbyWJjCaa	i would so read it it sounds like something i might get into i actually want to read it right now can you send me a copy by email when its finished|`|lz358rnfaa	It seems interesting, but I don't think you should use the flower, maybe something else?|`|j3zr22VUaa	Maybe, if it was well written.  I don't really get the plot as you described it, so I have only one suggestion--call it the 'blood orchid' instead of the 'red blood orchid.'  'red blood' is just redundant.|`|KHNBcsdkaa	I agree, it is slightly confusing, but it could turn out to be good if you write it properly. My only concern is that with the release of Twilight, EVERYBODY wants to write a book about vampires, most of which will be branded as ripoffs. Maybe you could think of some other fantasy creature?|`|jIMcfyLDaa	i don't like how everyone is asking you about the whole book already when you haven't even finished writing it yet or something and telling everyone like how she went in a coma would ruin it and yes, i would probably read something like this, there should be a twist in it though like maybe the best friend and ex start to like each other through the dangers they have to face together or one of them falls in love or is drawn to a vampire and the vampire keeps that one there and only one of the, can go back and take the flower to the girl in a coma. it would be an interesting book.|`|NBfg20FRaa	No it doesn't sound that interesting to me. I love Vampire books though. Maybe change it where it could be more logical, more realistic. People would love a good book to read.|`|lUsLBUXRaa	Just throwing it out there: putting "it is copyright. c" and "copyright of ms" on your question gives you NO protection. You cannot copyright an idea.    I suggest you learn basic things, such as their vs. there, before you pursue writing too fully.|`|LykjWv6faa	Sounds a little vague. Usually, I'd say no to vampire stories since they have been reused over and over again (most especially romantic interest between a mortal and a vampire.) But, this one seems to gravitate towards originality. I like the idea.|`|eQaApazjaa	why do they travel through a differnt dimension to get a flower? does it like save her life? & how do they get in the dimension? its kind of confusing and im not a big fan of vampire stories but who knows..if u write it in a way it all fits together then im sure it will turn out great!|`|6SyPeZ4Zaa	Well i personally think it would be a very good book because i love vampires and if you ever get it publisished i know one person who would buy it. it should have some action in it to because everyone loves action. but i think it sounds really good|`|Pq8gQsl2aa	If you want me to be honest I wouldn't really read a book like this, I don't get it.

7VpDEkC6aa	That looks like a really nice guitar. It's a little too BLACK for my tastes...it need a little more decoration or something. But as far a guitar goes it looks like it would be super.   That's a very high end Epiphone product, and I have the Epiphone Doubleneck SG and it is a fine guitar. I can't imagine the Gibson version is much, if any, better than mine.  It would definitely last you a long time. I'd have no problem buying a guitar of that quality.  Good for you.
OczYSP0daa	Hi Creed, Forgiveness is very much relevant BUT viewed it in a different form. I agree, we should forgive. We tend to wait for somebody to change or beg for our forgiveness before we "forgive". Even if one does not change; Forgiving means letting go of your hurt. Without forgiving, U cannot grow. People often keep their pain alive to show the world how badly treated they were. They damage themselves the most by doing this. The world does NOT care about your past. The world only wants to know what U are going to give today. When U hold onto old pain, self-pity taints your gift to others and U seem like a martyr.     Letting go of your hurt, opens the getaway to acceptance, the object of the mourning process. U release your hurt to diminish your burden so u can live freely in the present. That's why every society ritualizes funerals and losses in order to facilitate this outward expression of grief.    You cannot correct or alter what has been done to U. We need to forgive the people who have hurt us.    Forgiving does not mean that U have to be friends with the people who hurt you. It only means that U no longer allow you old hurt to cause U to suffer. You need to let go of your hurt. Even if your happiness and success relieves the guilt the people who hurt U or even brings them pleasure by allowing them to point your situation as proof they treated you well, you're still the beneficiary of letting go.    If U are holding on to your hurt to show others that they injured U, you are wasting your life. If you expect others to apologize for hurting U and wait until they do, U will suffer for a long time. U cannot delay your well-being by waiting for somebody to make good. If the other person was going to apologize, he would have done so by now.     Tell them, it's time to forgive and move on, they are only hurting themselves now.     Sadie|`|ePkiOzPSaa	While your reality doesn't make any more or less sense than anyone else's, it is not a commonly held belief.  People want forgiveness from you for wrongs because it is how they react to their own similar situations.  Not many people can just flip a switch on not blaming someone anymore, especially if that person has wronged them repeatedly in the past.      The issue with your way of thinking is that human beings have "memory" of the past, and they associate a person with the stimulus they have given off previously.  Much like eating something which gives you food poisoning may give you an aversion to that food, so do we avoid people who have wronged us before.  It's basic instinct - if something has harmed you in the past, stay away from it in the future, because it will probably do it again.    Also, while it's not impossible for a person to change, and switch to "good" actions, more often than not, if someone is treating you poorly and disregarding your feelings, they will continue doing so in the future.  A few "good" actions may prove as a guise for them to get into a good position to step on you again.    Whether I practice this whole belief system myself or not can remain a mystery, but I think that's a decent explanation of what you may have been looking for.  Most people do not think the way you do, with disregard for the past, nor is it an evolutionarily viable strategy.  Of course, evolution is taking strange steps for us.|`|T4CZbRsSaa	every time we think of you we suffer we remember the pain you caused us and the wounds are re-opened we cant let go of our feelings they define us we can come to terms with our suffering if that is forgiveness dont believe in good or evil it always comes back to self from one self to another we must come to terms with the damages caused and being caused our car wont fix itself and we rely on our car to make our livelihood we seek amends before forgiveness is an option
f4Nn0W1xaa	Javert, from Les Miserables, because he's supposed to be the villain only because we're supposed to sympathize with Jean Valjean. Javert is on the side of what he believes to be right throughout the whole long story and then, when he realizes all that he didn't know, he does the only thing he can, at least by his moral lights, and inflicts on himself the punishment that he was always ready to mete out to others. A genius villain and the best thing in a very good book, just the soul of nuance and the essence of how life is. I love Javert.|`|LykjWv6faa	Hmm...that's a difficult one to answer. I do enjoy the way John Milton portrays Satan...and I also like Lestat from Anne Rice's books.|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	The Judge from Blood Meridian.  He's pure in a twisted, evil way.|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	General Zaroff from The Most Dangerous Game. I love his pyshcology.|`|245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	Voldemort, because he's one of the few villains I completely understand.    Edit: Wait, I want to change it to Lestat from Interview with the Vampire by Anne Rice. We always see him as pure evil throughout the book, but at the end, it's obvious that he regrets killing Claudia. It gives him some three-dimensionality. And I haven't read the other books, so I don't know much about him yet. But Lestat is so complicated that he's one of the villains that I actually *want* to understand.|`|uSouun2saa	Snape when he was a villian, at least when he was suspected. Because he was so devilishly sarcastic and so good at acting. I'd didn't suspect him till the Prince's tale chapter.|`|83gqYA9paa	Oh that's a tough one. In books though I would have to say Dracula from the Historian. I knew I shouldn't be hoping for him as I read the book but I just couldn't help it. He was so interesting...and he loved books.|`|j3zr22VUaa	Hmm.  That's a tough one.  There are many I'm fond of--Capricorn in Inkheart, Frank Beddor's grisly Redd, Sauruman in LotR (I think he's more interesting than Sauron).  However, my current favorite is Odin in Neil Gaiman's American Gods--he's an unexpected, nasty, selfish, carefree villain the likes of which one rarely encounters.  One has sympathy for him, but only because the book absolutely forces you to.  It's the opposite of overt--and the synonym of awesome!|`|9cd620b8e74167fadf0f2dc25f9f4121aa	Voldemort.  because i can understand his reasons.|`|BqrQFLH5aa	Voldemort    because he is completely and utterly evil    but he's still human, aka understandable    which is incredibly difficult to pull off|`|0QR5sSICaa	I'd have to say Redd Heart from Frank Beddor's Looking Glass Wars Trilogy, because she isn't one to have a lot of advisors and not think and/or do anything by herself, and she's wicked cool.|`|5xQtFC5naa	Voldemort. He is interesting and hard to defeat.|`|4NnDsHKaaa	hmm, either Voldemort or Sauron. I like to know the history of the villain (how he became evil or was he evil most of his life). I also like the villain that isn't physically there but is behind all the evil-doings in the world, who's pretty much the villain that represents evil and darkness. Sauron didn't actually fight in the War of the Ring, he sent his minions to do it, but it was his power that caused the warring and darkness in Middle-Earth. Voldemort was an evil that hid in the shadows of Hogwarts. We feel uncomfortable and know that something bad is there or is about to happen, i love that in a villain.      Oh and Severus Snape, he was the mean teacher that picked on Harry throughout the entire potter series, and it turns put he was good. I love when a good guy becomes the villain or the villain becomes the good guy.
hxih07WKaa	Is this from a book or a movie? Sometimes narratives give someone character that there is no historical account of.     A slave would be rather die than submit themselves to that life because as a slave you dont know control your own destiny. You might as well be livestock.     Any "people" are subject to resorting to violence if they feel threatened.

j3zr22VUaa	It might be that, since they can't pinpoint the specific person using a spell in a multi-wizard building, they couldn't tell who used the curses, just that they were used.  They could have assumed Moody was showing the curses to an older set of students--after all, that WAS sanctioned by the Ministry.  Good question, though--there really isn't much of an explanation, is there?  Props for paying attention.|`|wnc6Y6o0aa	Harry was underage at the time that he did the patronus, and any wizard/witch under 17 has "the trace" on them. Bellatrix did the cruciatus curse on the Longbottoms, and I assume that an Auror would've found her doing said curse, thus sending her to Azkaban.  Moody wouldn't have been found out about, unless a student told.|`|245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	I don't think there was an explanation in the books. But my guess is that since Mad-Eye is an auror, and one of the best, he probably gets off the hook for these things. That's the only thing I can think of...    Edit: jules.lynn86, the unforgiveable curses are still illegal. I'm sure the Ministry has some type of trace for those curses. I agree with Weatherfield. It seems more probable that the Ministry thought he was showing the curses to older students.|`|PC12QYoDaa	I'm thinking since he planned on using them in class, Dumbledore might have mentioned it to the ministry maybe. That's the conclusion I had. Good Question though! It's always fun to find a tad of a mistake in books LOL
cxDbdhELaa	"Harmful" includes a lot of things we all do everyday, based on the way Enviro-whackos define the word for their cause.<br>  <br>  Most people don't really do things, willfully, which are harmful to the environment.  This is because when they do, they generally feel guilty about it.|`|v6CyvHLyaa	I don't feel any guilt at all. I'm sorry, but I just don't.|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...none, i need my truck on the road more than ever...daily...|`|07fd7ea1dbff60f8707ba40041258bc9aa	Each individual is freely given a bit of environment and treats it as they want to, they can make it bad or make it good, everyone does a bit to clean up the environment and it gets done.  Since we are aware of how to clean up the world, we would loose out if we did as it would use so much energy and wouldn't last long.  So if we all keep our bit clean then we shouldn't feel guilt for what others do with their bit.|`|099f9932fda7deca1bf90d1e23d79b0eaa	Neither anybody cares about it nor  feels sorry.|`|l34etpuSaa	i feel no guilt whatsoever and i will continue to do what i do|`|MH7qBYM1aa	normally, i don't feel guilty.<br>  but, when some thing (television or books ) inspire me about envirnment i feel guilty for a temprary time.<br>  <br>  the people who work hard for their dream of green world - i respect them.
lVAe2SLXaa	The arrogance of the unloved aged. Ignore them.|`|8ekoa6szaa	Because they have not lived long enough and had enough life experiences to know what love is.  <br>  <br>  There is a big, big difference between love, deep true lasting love, and infatuation.  <br>  <br>  Enjoy being young while you are young--there's plenty of time to find real love and be married when you are older.|`|R46f2nn9aa	Because infatuation usually comes first and a lot of times the younger you are the more naivve you can be and maybe not fully understand the difference.|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...because adults who complain don't know what love is...|`|y8bFwXZEaa	The adults who say it often don't know much more than the teens they are criticizing.<br>  <br>  Love in the heart is a metaphysical reaction in the mind to shared values.<br>  <br>  Teens too often mistake lust for love, not having known real love. Adults sometimes do the same, but cloak it with rationalizations because they don't have those shared values either--but they think they do because lust--not love--is blind.|`|AOtnoozdaa	When guys are teenagers they tend to think more with their krotches.  It's vulgar, but it's the truth.  When guys say they like a girl at that age, it's mostly because she's attractive, hot, and or popular.  They have a shallow perception of love.  I mean, I liked a girl in high school all because she had a nice pair of cheerleader legs, shallow?  OH Yeah!  and the thing is, at the time I started devoloping false feelings of what I thought was love, when in fact all it was was a fixsation and a lust for her looks.  I was too naive to figure out that a lust for someone's looks isn't love.  Physical Attraction isn't love, it's preference.  While emotional attraction is love.  Where you ignore looks and find out what's deep within, and yes, there are a lot of adult men who think with their krotches too, but mostly as you get older your perception of love goes from being shallow, to a deeper perception of love.<br>  <br>  In the end my advice to you is, ask your parents what their perception of love is, and to teach you what love is if they're so smart.  Love is something you find out for yourself.  Some figure it out sooner than others and some never find out.  By the context of this question it sounds as if you know what love is.  It's all about emotional maturity, if you have that emotional maturity, than you definently know what love is.  Good luck man, I hope I helped.|`|CKxe1R3aaa	because they went threw hurt times. they htought they were in love at one point and they dont want you to make the same mistakes.  but if you talk to the people who have been with their childhearts and are still together then they will not say you dont know what love is beacuse they were and still are in love.|`|fccdcaa6e1aa306a88110de27284c970aa	Because they think teens dont know nothing and they know it all and im not being rude it's just the truth im very much in love and im a teenager and i would die for him so adults think that know what it is all the time hope i helped|`|AHJLrr2Faa	Because parents and adults can be stupid. They don't know how you feel about someone and i think they only say that because they don't want you to really fall in love.|`|HpwevWYlaa	Because a teenager's brain is not fully developed. This does not mean a teen cannot fall in love, but I suppose that's where adults get it.|`|LuND86GIaa	I personally think that <br>  A. they have forgotten any kind of youth<br>  B. they did not experience it<br>  C. they are cynical|`|VLP5l3J0aa	You think you know but in truth what you know is raging hormones that want to get out of control|`|YmtNel5haa	because adults have been through a lot of experiences with love and pain and they want to spare their child so they say that hoping it will but what they don't realize is that they are not validating their children's feelings and I think that could potentially make their children feel like their parent's don't respect their feelings.  It sounds like cruelness, but it isn't necessarily meant that way.
Mig6O93Naa	you are either reacting to the other actors like an audience member rather than acting your part or you are thinking that people are judging you as being stupid.  Neither thing is acting.

xFg8mQeCaa	There's a commonly held view that Douglas Haig was a bone-headed, callous butcher, who through his incompetence as commander of the British Army in WWI, killed a generation of young men on the Somme and Passchendaele. On the other hand there are those who view Haig as a man who successfully struggled with appalling difficulties to produce an army which took the lead in defeating Germany in 1918, winning the greatest series of victories in British Military history.  Just as the success of the Alanbrooke war diaries can be put down to its 'horse's mouth' view of Churchill and the conduct of WWII, so Haig's Diaries, hitherto only previously available in bowdlerised form, give the C-in-C's view of Asquith - he records him getting drunk and incapable - and his successor Lloyd George, of whom he was highly critical. As Haig records the relationship it was stormy ('I have no great opinion of L.G as a man or leader' - Sept 1916). The diaries show him intriguing with the King (George V) vs. Lloyd George. Additional - and never previously published - are his day by day accounts of the key battles of the war, not least the Somme campaign of 1916. 'I found Foch (Allied C-in-C) most selfish and obstinate. ... Foch suffers from a swollen head, and thinks himself another Napoleon.'  Haig is revealed as an early admirer of the tank and of the 'airoplane'. He revels in turning the well-meaning BEF under Sir John French into the professional fighting force that eventualy one the war.|`|AA11942204	I think he was a sociopath. All those deaths, which did not seem to be affecting him at all, for what?|`|05anyV31aa	A hero.      The Entente was on its way to losing if he didnt do the things he did. What other way was there to wage warfare on the Western Front than infantry attacks with artillery barrages.  He was correct in using tank warfare when the innovation came along and his counter offensives against the Germans in 1918 won the war. He is a hero
AJopJTuxaa	Hi    If you crop it properly, its perfect. As one poster stated, cut off some of the bottom. I suggest to cut off a little of the right side while will allow good cropping.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	Nice and sharp, good color tone. I'd shave off a bit of the negative space on the bottom, the eye keeps going to that instead of the branch.

Best advice is to paint what you know is beautiful, and add yourself into it.|`|pDKm9Wmgaa	Does the project have to be of something specific and identifiable? If not, you can wet your paper and drop different colors onto it with your brush, letting them flow together. Once you have the paper filled with color, but is still wet; lay some plastic wrap that you have crumpled up on it and crumple it some more, but being careful not to smear the paint underneath. Leave the plastic to dry completely. Once it's dry you can remove it, leaving behind some very nice effects. This is really simple to do and looks really nice.

rPam42Dnaa	well, i have not taught myself pointe but i want to go on pointe very badly! see, i take ballet classes but i only started in october, but i have been dancing since i was 2 (mostly modern but some ballet)...         aaneyway...my teacher said that i was strong enough to go on pointe but i didn't know the coreography of the things we do in class well enough (idk y this has ANYTHING to do with going on pointe considering we aaren't even doing that coreography stage)...so to answer your question, i havent taught my self pointe but i think i might b/c she has no good reason not to let me start. even my modern teacher said that i would be very good at pointe work. there are, however, some risks of teaching yourself pointe work.    - you may not be strong enough to go on pointe.   - you could teach yourself wrong.  - you could permanantly injure yourself.   - you may go on too long and injure yourself.    anyway...i hope i helped and good luck...|`|plGuYnNDaa	Well it wouldnt be more dangerous than if you had training but you might not know how to do things properly. First you have to strengthen your feet before you go up on pointe and you can find those on the internet.. You just have to be patient and teach yourself the right way but its definately posible.. Good Luck :):)|`|e3wVUCHraa	Im teaching myself at the moment and its not dangerouse as long as you dont over do it. start with normal ballet and work yourself upwards. and to strengthen your feet just do a lot of stretches, look them up on youtube and you will get loads to help you. once you start practicing pointe, only go on pointe for about 20 minutes a day, any more than this and you could damage your feet, you will probably say thats ok and once you get to it you will want to carry on going, but dont, know when to stop, because you might damage your feet and that could stop you from practicing for weeks and maybe months, where as if you take it slow you will eventually do more than 20 minutes a day. if you want to do more than this a day then this best thing to do is to do 15 minutes in the morning then another 15 minutes at night. if you practice this everyday for about 4 weeks, you can then start adding about a couple of minutes on to your 20 minute limit eventually you will be able to go on pointe for as long as you want whenever you want! just keep practicing but dont do too much, if you really want to practice more then why not do 20 minutes of pointe then go on to do other ballet moves or stretch to improve your flexibilty in ballet. dont worry loads of people have taught themselves (including me) so its not a huge danger or anything, people are just saying that incase your feet arent strong enough but only you will know that. hope this helps!  x|`|HYVKARkyaa	1. you won't stand properly on them, so knee and ankle and other injuries  2. if you attempt to dance without the barre you with fall a few times and that will be more ankle and knee injuries.  3. later on after a while of not doing it properly you with have lots of knee problems for the rest of your life (even if you do stop trying pointe) And you will be more at risk of getting arthritis.    So please don't even try.|`|7rQDuCDlaa	You won't be able to correct yourself. If you get into bad habits, there won't be anyone to say 'stop that, you'll break your ankle.' . You could very easily set yourself up for injury by doing something basic incorrectly, which you may get away with for a while, but when you try something more ambitious, it won't hold you and you'll get hurt.    There is serious possibility for damaging yourself if you don't have someone who knows what they're doing supervising you. Don't do it.|`|jlLSHwICaa	i would not recomend it at all, you should definitely be taught it by a proffesional, and also take regular ballet classes along with pointe, because you could easily injure you ankle or foot|`|anmbQv0Saa	Well, there are many dangers of teaching yourself how to dance on pointe for example if your teacher hasn't told you to go on pointe yet then your ankles are not strong enough to go on pointe and if you go on then you could suffer long term problems with your ankles. I don't really think that you should teach yourself as there are special techniques and if you do not execute these techniques then you could badly damage your feet. But, if you still want to go on pointe and teach yourself try going on youtube and finding various videos on how to train yourself    Good Luck  xxx|`|6W5thuR3aa	i think its very dangerous to teach yourself pointe work unless you have been advised by a dance teacher or if you have extremely strong feet and ankles. this is because pointe is very strenuous and can damage feet, ankles and legs very easily if its not done correctly. i have been on pointe for two years now and practice myself a lot but have lessons each week. if you feel ready to go on to pointe ask your dance teacher for advice and tips. hope i helped :) x
f4Nn0W1xaa	Well, I have to recommend it because it's probably my favorite book in the world and I've read it about fifty times and have chunks of it memorized. I think it's a masterpiece of modern literature and I can't believe everyone doesn't love it like I do.    That being said, it is written very unconventionally both in form and in style and I have had a few friends say that they found it difficult to follow. I never felt that way, and I know other people who aren't madly in love with it who had no problem reading it.     I'm a big fan of Babbitt too, you can't really go wrong with either of these books, you should really read them both, at some point. Babbitt is much more straightforward, as far as reading something for school, but I'd still prefer to think of you reading Sometimes A Great Notion!    Enjoy!|`|Bgqi0pOuaa	I second what "reader" has to say.    "Sometimes a Great Notion" is an amazing book, and often critically acclaimed as the closest we'll ever get to the elusive "great American novel".  If you like a challenge, I'd recommend it over "Babbit".  "Babbit" is great, but it's much less complex--just a simple satire of the period.    In "Notion" Kesey captures a spirit of his native Oregon.  It is brilliantly crafted--he often has two or three different voices narrating in a single paragraph--and it takes quite a lot of focus to follow all the nuances.  If you aren't intimidated by that sort of thing, go for it--you won't be let down.|`|hQ95u9OLaa	I'm sorry that I can't answer about Notion, but One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is really good. Funny I haven't read Babbit either but Elmer Gantry is excellent.

JIFi4Cvmaa	answer-lawful monarchs from the royal families that had ruled before Napoleon would be restored to power.    Metternich was the principal negotiator and dominant member at the Congress of Vienna, earning himself the title "coachman of Europe." During the negotiations, Metternich developed a bitter personal enmity with Tsar Alexander I of Russia, due to the Russian plans for Polandfiercely resisted by Metternichand by an alleged competition for the affection of the beautiful Wilhelmina von Sagan. Metternich sought to form a coalition with Viscount Castlereagh and Hardenberg, the Prussian chancellor, to oppose Alexander's plans for a constitutional Kingdom of Poland under Russia's rule. These efforts failed because of the unwillingness of the Prussians to stand up to Alexander. Metternich then shocked the Prussians by signing an alliance with Castlereagh and Talleyrand, the French envoy, on January 3, 1815, to prevent the annexation of Saxony by Prussia, which was to be her compensation for giving up Polish land to Alexander. While this was successful in saving the King of Saxony, northern areas of the kingdom were ceded in perpetuity to Prussia and Alexander managed to get most of what he wanted in Poland. Austria never regained the land gained in the partition of Poland.  At the same time, Metternich worked hard in negotiations with Prussia, Hanover, Bavaria, and Wrttemberg to resolve the organization of Germany. The resulting Germanic Confederation (Deutscher Bund) bore much of the stamp of his ideas and was used as a means to achieving other ends, as were other organizations of the period. This unified the area with 39 German states and four free cities under a single Constitution with a single Diet, or parliament. Princes, however, retained much of their power. The Diet was symbolic, with very little power of its own. Its presidency was permanently occupied by Austria. Matternich was appointed Chancellor in 1821.  Metternichs most notable achievement in the years following the Congress was turning the Tsar into a protector of the old order (Alexander had seen himself as a protector of liberalism). This led to the Tsars decision at the Congress of Troppau, in 1820, when he assented to Metternichs repression of a Neapolitan rebellion and refused to aid Greek rebels against the Ottoman Empire. This is most aptly demonstrated by Metternichs subversion of the Holy Alliance, from an institution advocating Christian ideals in politics (which, in 1815, was described as a "loud-sounding nothing" by Metternich and "a piece of sublime mysticism and nonsense" by Castlereagh) to an anti-revolutionary institution used as a bastion of conservatism.  Over the succeeding decades, Metternich developed into a reactionary protector of the rights of Kings and Emperors in an era of rising democratic sentiment. Wanting stability above all, he feared what he saw as the fickleness of popular sentiment and the excesses of what had occurred in revolutionary France. He had a free hand in conducting the foreign affairs of the Austrian Empire for some thirty years, especially after the death of Emperor Francis I in 1835, when the mentally challenged Ferdinand I took the throne. However, a number of vital committees were run out of Metternichs control, and a number of domestic affairs state matters were outside of Metternichs reach: Both Francis and Ferdinand were adamant about their absolute rights and were known to rebuff some of Metternichs advances, while figures such as the court chancellor Count Kolowratwho mistrusted Metternichs politics and birthtook office in positions that opposed Metternichs power. His conservatism, however, was quite popular in a Europe at the time that "was deeply attached to order, authority, and patriarchal rule"  Due to the fact that Metternich dominated Austrian politics during the era, and mainly because he best exemplifies the spirit of the Concert of Europe, the period in between the final defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte at Waterloo in 1815 and the Liberal Revolutions of 1848 is often referred to as the Age of Metternich. No major war engulfed Europe until World War I, largely due to the maintenance of the balance of power.
jI85GYGoaa	Not really my area but some thoughts do occur.    Reflect the role of women generally within the context of the Industrial revolution (ie predominantly rural to industrial environments)    The examples of notable exceptions due to 'Class structure' - Queen Victoria.    The Emancipation Movement - E Pankhurst etc  Issues such as the effects of contraception - Employment law and present day discrimination.    Obviously the relevance or not has to be balanced according to how your coursework units are broken up but theres no shortage of stuff to go at.    Best Wishes

The Ark is of more interest because the dimensions are correct for a Ship of that size and yet it is a very ancient story. The calendar was not constructed from the Birth of Christ but the Gregorian calendar is near enough. However it has been changed and adjusted several times, March being Spring, began the original calendar hence October was the eighth month. The Moslem's call AD - CE, Common Era and they start the Moslem calendar from the birth of the Holy Prophet. The Egyptians stood in Aswan and noticed that they had no shadow at mid-day, This told them that they were 90deg. up to the sun so they took more measurements and angles from Alexandra and worked out the length of time the Sun rotated around the Earth, (yes I know it is the Earth rotating around the Sun) they made it 360 times per year.

Telling someone to be his/herself is really telling them the exact opposite. It's telling someone that he or she is not good enough and that they need to change. Thus, the confusion that you're probably feeling. The best advice that I can give you is just not worry to much about it. The thing about today's society is that people will always find something wrong with you. Either you're too quiet or talk too much. Either you have too little energy or you have too much. Either you're standoffish or pretentious. Just accept yourself unconditionally and maybe try to do it for others once in a while.

4NnDsHKaaa	Yeah, many writers do. Where their main character is the underdog or is good that faces evil. I'm working on a sort of history of a fantasy land. The history will come with many different stories of the persons involved.     My stories involve: a pair of gravediggers, gnomes, dwarves, a poor family, a boy from a clan that lives in the wild (they resemble the native american tribe I'm from), most of the main characters are good, some are evil, and some were good main characters that become evil. These are only a few of the many stories i'm working on to make up the history of my world. They are all different stories set in different times of the history but most of them have something to do with the final outcome of the history, which is a sort of end of times conclusion. Actually the descendants of some of the characters in previous stories meet in the ending.    The reason for the many different characters is to have a different flavor or feal to the story instead of just the underdog overcoming evil and becoming the hero (although that does happen in the end times story).|`|ZRbc4gPZaa	+|`|AHuBqplbaa	I think most writers tend to stick to a typical idea.  Stephen King tends to choose the common person (though of varying types), while Terry Brooks is into the typical fantasy creatures, and all the other examples of the above too.

jN5SXl5Caa	In my opinion it's about perspective. If from the day I was born I won $120 million every 2 days. Then one day I win $1 million. I would be pretty disappointed because I had the bar set at $120. Now if today in my real life I won $100,000 I would be very excited.

Most of the "bad singers" just don't know how to use their voices. Besides - it never hurts to try.

644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	The Soviets never claimed they had a communist state; the very words are a contradiction since Marx said that the state "would wither away" when communism was adopted.    The U.S.S.R. and other countries were ruled by the Communist Party, but they claimed they were socialist states.     The theory that "from each according to his ability and to each according to his needs" doesn't mean complete equality in all ways. Some people have greater abilities than others, and I imagine that leaders of the Communist Party would argue that some people have greater needs.|`|AA11835015	well, there was a single party, the communist party. TRUE communism has been speculated to be a cashless society. why not -look at the greed money creates.  i am in russia, six months or more at a time for 10 years. some of the communist ideals still linger. much medical care is free. our city provides art lessons (painting, molding dough, beads weaving) free of charge, offers music and singing lessons free and dance lessons at a fee ($8) a month), all for children.  some industries maintain a house of culture- dance lessons, traditional performances, stage circuses, concerts, etc for a fee.  the only bad i see here was the destruction of churches because the state was against faith in God. the people kept faith in their hearts and it is increasing today in the purest church of all. the russian orthodox church. it has no social parties, dinners, etc. just religious service as it has been for over 1000 years.|`|ky3B42f6aa	Forget all the propaganda you have heard.  No country on this planet has seriously attempted to implement the doctrines of communism -- the same sort of life as proclaimed by Jesus Christ.  Well, and, of course, Robin Hood.  The countries that claimed to be following communism were lying as much as the countries who claim to be following Christ.  All of them are falsifiers of the first degree.  Pure communism cannot exist on this earth, just as pure Christianity cannot exist. People are just too greedy, selfish, arrogant, and aggressive to let such happen.

bdnMQnVHaa	Louisiana Purchase was made in 1803.  United States wanted free navigation of the Mississippi River and wanted to purchase New Orleans from the French.  The French sold all of their territory to the Rocky Mountains to the US.  St. Louis was included.    The Oregon Treaty was signed in 1846 between the United States and Great Britain.  All territory west of the Rocky Mountains, north of the 42nd parallel was acquired.  Prior to the treaty, US and UK jointly occupied.  The 1844 presidential election was run largely on this issue.  James Polk, the winner, vowed to extend the US to the Pacific.    The Mexican American War was fought between 1846 and 1848.  Texas, claimed by Mexico, but operating independently, was annexed by the US in 1845.  Again Polk, wanting to extend US territory, incited an incident on the Mexican border and the war started.  In the treaty in 1848 the US acquired all the territory north of the Rio Grandee.|`|644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	Both St. Louis and New Orleans were founded by French settlers, and both became part of the United States with the 1803 Louisiana Purchase. They're exactly in the same places now as they were then.      The 1783 Treaty of Paris with Great Britain defined the original borders of the United States. Due to ambiguities in the treaty, the ownership of Machias Seal Island and North Rock remain disputed between the U.S. and Canada; other original territorial ambiguities (including the Northeastern Boundary Dispute and the disputed Indian Stream territory) were resolved by the Webster-Ashburton Treaty in 1842.    The Louisiana Purchase, completed 1803, was negotiated by Robert Livingston during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson; the territory was acquired from France for $11,250,000. A small portion of this land was ceded to the United Kingdom in 1818 in exchange for the Red River Basin. More of this land was ceded to Spain in 1819 with the Florida Purchase, but was later reacquired through Texas annexation and Mexican Cession.    West Florida was declared by President James Madison to be a U.S. possession in 1810.    Tristan da Cunha was the first, albeit short-lived U.S. overseas possession. This remote South Atlantic island was first claimed in 1810 by Jonathan Lambert from Salem, Massachusetts, who died in a boating accident in 1812. During the War of 1812, the U.S. used it as a naval and piracy base against British shipping. The island was abandoned after the war and annexed within months by the British, along with Ascension Island, in order to prevent the French from establishing bases from which to rescue Napoleon Bonaparte from Saint Helena.    Red River Basin, acquired in 1818 by treaty from the United Kingdom, namely the Anglo-American Convention of 1818.    The Adams-Ons Treaty of 1819 with Spain resulted in Spain's cession of East Florida and the Sabine Free State and Spain's surrender of any claims to the Oregon Country. Article III of the treaty, when properly surveyed, resulted in the acquisition of a small part of central Colorado.    Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 which finalized the border between United States and Canada (a British colony at the time).    Texas Annexation of 1845: In 1836 the Republic of Texas voted to be annexed by the United States. Despite the fact that Mexican leader Antonio Lpez de Santa Anna warned that this would be "equivalent to a declaration of war against the Mexican Republic," President John Tyler signed a treaty of annexation with Texas in April 1844. After James Polk, a strong supporter of territorial expansion, won the presidency, but before he took office, Congress approved the annexation of Texas on February 28, 1845. On December 29, 1845, Texas became the 28th state.    Oregon Country, the area of North America west of the Rockies to the Pacific, was jointly controlled by the U.S. and the United Kingdom following the Anglo-American Convention of 1818 until 1846 when the Oregon Treaty divided the territory at the 49th parallel (see Oregon boundary dispute). The San Juan Islands were claimed and jointly occupied by the U.S. and the U.K. from 1846-1872 due to ambiguities in the treaty (see Northwestern Boundary Dispute). Arbitration led to the sole US possession of the San Juan Islands since 1872.    Mexican Cession lands were a product of the Mexican-American War and the subsequent Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed February 2, 1848. In this treaty, Mexico gave the U.S. parts of what is Texas, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and Wyoming, and the whole of California, Nevada and Utah and recognized the Rio Grande as Texas' Southern border. The United States paid Mexico $15 million. In addition, the United States agreed to pay claims made by American citizens against Mexico, which amounted to more than $3 million.|`|j4mrLxUyaa	St Louis, MO  New Orleans, LA

When Special Circumstances finds out, they get tally and make her go find shay and reveal the location of the smoke, or else they wont let tally become pretty.  tally must decide what will she do to be pretty?  is her friendship with shay more important? and what does it really mean to be pretty?      in my opinion, uglies is a very good book.  it is interesting, and unlike any other.  it has a twist on real issues that girls go through today.  there is the topic of conformity and being pretty and friendships. its a really interesting book.     you should read it, cuz then, if you dont like it, at least you can say you tried instead of wondering about what it would have been like if you did.|`|5fDnoYCBaa	I don't usually like science-fiction, but Uglies was an exception. It was suspenseful and interesting. The narrator is a girl, so I think it is a bit better for the tween to teenage girl audience rather than for boys. It gives a really good view on where our old world is heading and it makes the reader revaluate what they are doing and what society today can do better for tomorrow. Overall, 5 star book.    It has sequels too! Pretties and Specials are also great books, in the same sort of way. After reading Uglies, you are going to want to read the next books.

PCVJg5ieaa	There's some really good ones out there.  Think outside the box is best:    James Thurber has some 'classic' things.  Roald Dahl always has fun stuff.    Mark Twain has some awesome stuff that no one does in speech.    But those might be too classic for you.  Here's some off-the-radar pieces that I thought are good for speech events:    Stephen Millhauser "The Wizard of West Orange"  Edward Hale "My Double, and how he undid me" is awesome and I could never find someone to do it.  I just found "Tone" by YZ Chin to be a funny 'high-schoolish' short story that should amuse and endear.    Check out: http://www.short-stories.co.uk/ for a great collection of contemporary short stories.  If it had been around when I was coaching, my life would have been a lot easier.    EDIT: I figured you were doing OI.  Any of the ones above would still be good, and humorous OIs do very, very well in a lot of places (does depend on your region a little bit), Probably ignore Steven Millhauser's piece as it would probably be better for a male.  But, have fun with this.      Good luck.|`|2hAuIg5baa	neil gaimen- the fairy reel.    or a song that has meaning.|`|j3zr22VUaa	You could try doing something by Neil Gaiman--"The Case of the Four and Twenty Blackbirds" is free online--go to neilgaiman.com--cool stuff and things--short stories.  There's a very creepy story about a wedding gift in the introduction of his story collection 'Smoke and Mirrors.'  If you're looking for something weird, try a Francesca Lia Block piece--in 'Girl Goddess  9' there's a story about a girl with two mothers.  It's a bit long, but ripe for cutting.  In the collection 'Magic in the Mirrorstone' there's a cute frog-princess story--funny, short, relevant--that could do you quite well.  These suggestions may be completely useless, but I hope they aren't!

hQ95u9OLaa	If you are writing about the French Resistance, than logically the Vichy government would play a part in your book. This is just a novel but The Dream of Scipio tells about the French response to the Nazis. Otherwise my advice is to go to the library and find factual books about your subject.

9233401496ab10d52d1644174696a803aa	After WW II the map of the Middle East had changed. Palestine was under the suzerainty of Britain and the war changed this when Britain got out. Also it was decided by the UN at the time that the Jewish people should have their own homeland and they had been lobbying for Palestine since 1897 because they considered it their traditional home land even though they had not occupied it in 6,000 years. The other thing was oil and its importance was realized due to the mechanization of war for tank, planes and ships. The Arab world considered this a western world plot against the Arabs and led to revolts especially of Egypt under Nasser who took control of the Suez Canal much to the chagrin of Britain and France but Eisenhower decided not to support a war over the Canal. In all Britain and France lost the control they had in the Middle East as the Arab countries became more independent and demanded a share of the oil revenues until they nationalized oil.|`|AA11304025	Jewish terrorist gangs operated against the British and Christians and Muslims during the 1940s carrying out many atrocities.

First and foremost, because of the holocaust it became clear to the world that the Jews needed a Homeland.

Secondly, inspite of the British governments position, many common Brits, including Soldiers, began to feel strongly about the Jews having a Homeland because of their strong support for Britian during the War.    Finally, in contrast to my second point, the Arabs had, generally, supported Germany during the war.|`|IGGmNExRaa	it was not a turning point,but rather a starter.

bdnMQnVHaa	The Republican Party was founded on a anti-slavery platform.|`|5llBXFF4aa	That's a good question, because you ask "to what extent..."  Yes, Lincoln was elected through he Republican Party, and the Republican party was an anti-slavery party.  However, Lincoln wasn't running as an abolitionist - he abhorred slavery, but he wasn't going to try to end it where it already existed (he didn't think the President had such powers).  He was against the spread of slavery to new territories, and that was his official position.  He saw slavery eventually fading away as moral pressure and economic realities forced it to over time, but he didn't plan to be an instrument of that.  Abolitionists, who wanted slavery done away with right now, thought he was too soft on the issue - however, many voted for him base don party, or based on the fact that the Democratic candidate would not have worked to stop the spread of slavery.    The abolitionist movement, though gaining strength throughout the 1850's, was not strong enough yet to produce a mandate.      The southern slaves state didn't even have Lincoln on the ballot in most places.     The northern free states, comprise mostly of anti-slavery and pro-Union people, elected Lincoln, but outside of protecting the Union (which Lincoln vowed to do above all else), there was no clear mandate across the country - that came later.|`|AA11435910	Lincoln was not agaist slavery.

But, art itself can be a very destructive entity when it is coupled with knowledge.  <br>  Take Edgar Allan Poe or Albert Einstein.<br>  "On October 7, 1849, at age 40, Poe died in Baltimore; the cause of his death is unknown and has been variously attributed to alcohol, brain congestion, cholera, drugs, heart disease, rabies, suicide, tuberculosis, and other agents."<br>  Now Einstein is a whole different story!  I don't know how he died, but from his mind came the designs and writings that the scientific community used to invent the atomic bomb.<br>  So, it can go both ways.|`|y8bFwXZEaa	Spiritually, yes, and that spiritual death can lead to the real thing.<br>  <br>  However, it isn't the inability to express one's self that is usually a problem. Real artists learn to express no matter how. Painters who's upper bodies don't work learn to use their feet instead of hands. The blind can learn to type their stories, etc.<br>  <br>  Usually this spiritual death is caused by someone with the heart of an artist foresaking it to be the laywer his mothers wants him to be; or the factory worker alongside his father, rather than the football star his father tells him is a "foolish dream."<br>  <br>  A real artist-at-heart will find the outlet, and if the emotional "recognition" is all he/she is looking for, he/she is not an artist but an egotist, instead.|`|HpwevWYlaa	If you're an artist than you'll find some way to express yourself.

Try it on, It's TOO BIG for anyone else.  Proof that God exists, ha!|`|AA11564934	Ok, I'll answer this for the 97th time:  It boils down to 2 things for me, how does one reconcile omnipotence, omnibenevolence and omniscience with this world and the life on it. And, why are there so many billions of people living in entire, huge countries whose culture has nothing remotely like the xian god and jesus. Here is a post I did before on the topic:    Because I look at what life was like for human beings for the past 40,000 years (maybe 6,000 for you). People lived for an average of 30-40 years. More than 50% of children died before age one (until about 100 years ago!). I look at thousands of children permanently blinded by parasites they get from playing in creeks in underdeveloped countries.    Then I look at children of modern developed countries, of any religion. I see that they live until their EIGHTIES!! Have all their teeth for a very long time. Have excellent health, etc... And I see that this has nothing to do with religion or god. It is medicine and science. So was it god's plan that hundreds of generations of people would suffer and die in their 40's and suddenly in the 19th and 20th century, everything would get better?    That's nothing other than sadistic.    I also look at all the different gods and interpretations of these gods for the past 4,000-5,000 years. I see how silly it is to point to one religion in the roman era and say "Ah, THIS is the correct one!"    I also posted this in answer to that question:  * The bible has many contradictions  * The bible shows the OT god to be violent and bloodthirsty. He also kills thousands of children.  * For thousands of years, man has had a lifespan of 30-40 years. 100 years ago in the US, 50% of children died before age 1. Modern medicine has greatly reduced this. During eras in western history when the catholic church was in charge and belief in god and church attendance was required, this did not change. So prayer seems not to have been the answer.  * The history of religions and gods seems to show that man has no consistent image or view of what god is or does.  * The bible is open enough to interpretation that if you walked into a church and asked 3 people questions about the bible or god's will, you would get probably 8 different answers.  * People kill each other in god's name every day and he apparently does nothing to stop it.  * 50% of conceptions do not result in birth  * 1 in 8 pregnancies result in twins and one twin is eventually reabsorbed.  * Children are born with no brains, with no limbs, retarded, blind.  * Children go blind from parasites every day, children suffer asthma, and other diseases    Notice I focus on CHILDREN, not adults so please don't tell me that millions of children are dying b/c god wants us to have free will. These children barely have free will yet and toddlers don't have it at all.|`|uyQXdKLiaa	Proof is subjective. There are no facts, only interpretations.|`|URO3gDXcaa	the proof is on the believer.  we all know there is no proof one way or another.  a non believer does not have to try to disprove a god.|`|KK5nbzGuaa	Reason & Proof : Great prophets and sages of all time have said that they "have seen" God and have felt His omnipresence through direct perception. Now those people were not from heaven or moon or any other planet who claim to have felt the presence of God. If they could see Him, feel Him through direct perception, so comes true with everyone of us. Even we can feel and see Him. The reasoning is deduced from past experiences of the prophets. Whoever has seen Him, felt Him, have preached of brotherhood, love and oneness of the universe. This means there is no  contradiction in their experiences when they preach the above things. So past knowledge, not contradicting with experiences is consistent and true here.|`|sEUnAmv6aa	obviously not|`|GBRmOem8aa	I don't think... "god" the one that everyone believes in... exists.... but I do believe there is a higher power.... I believe there isn't a god.... well because it has not been proved... and the bible is a bunch of bull.... and I think that all the saints and stuff are just a by-stand because "god" wouldn't be able to have all these people believe in him on his own... he needs help.... I think that people just need someone to love, and they need to feel loved so they turn to "god" to receive that love... so that they never go a second unloved... it is a feeling of security and protection... and love.... and everyone needs it.|`|eGh9HLXcaa	Well I believe that He does exist too. Anyway perhaps this question would be better asked in Religion and Spirituality.    It's because I accept the theory of Intelligent Design, that nature could not have just developed on its own with no superior supernatural mind behind it all. But to the skeptic, he/she would reject this concept because they think that nature has many flaws and so is not intelligently designed, so in this way, the belief in the existence of God is subjective, rather than there being solid proof.    To me, the best proof is accounts of Near Death Experiences as well as the healing testimonies. Some would say that NDEs were either being made up or that the experiences they encountered were not real and were just 'in their head' after all. As for the many testimonies you hear from people being converted from a non-believer to a believer, the skeptic would say that these people are foolish and they have just made a silly decision based on blind faith.     So to the person who's inclined to believe that God exists, perhaps due to his passive character, he would accept the various 'proofs' that God exist, willingly and humbly. But to the person who's more inclined to reject the notion of a any supernatural forces let alone an omnipotent God, when presented with the same 'proofs' showed to the believer, he would reject them and come up with all sorts of reasons why he should not be taken in by them.     Thus even if I think there is proof in NDEs, various healing testimonies etc, to another skeptical person, they would be no more than mere speculations, not worthwhile at all to lead them to a belief in God.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	I suggest that you study the section in The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy concerning the Babel Fish.|`|RutQ1BNsaa	I know by my heart and mind that God exist and with my religion i feel safe and happy also i will never fear future or death .So God exist or not i will loose nothing .|`|dl0EpJPDaa	These should help.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcncPpQ8l...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kK1YgR7J...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhyd9vG2...|`|shcnDVHsaa	Meditation.Soul. Have you ever thought that those people were LYING? Just perhaps, they wanted attention.|`|8ZcGDTzOaa	There is a simple method to do this if you are serious.  First, you outline your definitions of God, then   Second, you show evidence that God exists, based on your definition.    Example:  1. I believe God is my cat.  2. My cat exists ( I can see it, feed it, etc... )    If you accept my definition, then you must also accept that God exists.    The other way to do it is show the reasons you believe in God.  However, if the reasons also apply to something else that you don't believe in, then you are lying.    For example:    1. I prayed to God that it would rain tomorrow.  2. It rained tomorrow  3. Therefore I believe    But if you also did:  1. I prayed to Mr. Potato Head it would be sunny tomorrow.  2. It is sunny tomorrow  3. I still don't believe in Mr. Potato Head.    Then you are lying.|`|AA12280291	Our Existence is PROOF God exists!|`|JPlVt9xYaa	If a person has to prove "God" then "He" wouldn't be. We use physical science to prove things of this world and that works. We use faith to prove God and that works. God does exist, but not in terms man can ever understand and it is meant to be that way. If I have to prove my love for someone, it really isn't there as a two way street. Those of us who believe in a multidimensional universe know that there is no human type communication between the dimensions, but a spiritual one that some have and some don't. The more we use our muscles, the stronger we get and the same goes with our faith. Show me a pound of faith or an inch of faith and I will be able to give you all the proof you need.    Now, as for proof. I can only prove it to myself and I have. I hope you can do the same for yourself.    These are good questions, anytime a question get so much activity, it stimulates the thought process and gives rise to improvements. You have done a good job, keep up the good work.|`|enhv1HSXaa	I don't know that I can answer your question about proof but I will at least comment.  The neat thing about religion is for it to work you have to have faith. Faith is being able to believe something is true without seeing results. If you don't have faith all the proof in the world will mean nothing. Two movies I think about are "Contact" and "Horton Hears a Who".  Can you prove you love someone? People have tried to use the Big Bang theory vs a wrist watch debate. If you haven't heard it the idea is break a wrist watch into all its pieces and place it in a box and shake it until all the pieces coincidentally come together in perfect working order. If you don't have faith that someone is in control of that you could say, however remote the chance, there is a chance that this could happen. The only way I know to have it proved is to exercise faith, ask and receive a personal witness "testimony" from the holy spirit that it is true. Science and logic will never be able to prove it because we are examining eternal entities with mortal, infantile minds.|`|kZlV6msDaa	Like people have already said, it would be foolish to try to "prove God exists" because it can't be done. It's one of those free will things that we talk about a lot in Catholicism. Basically, God so loves us that He wants us to be our own people, not robots or any form, and make our own choices, and hopefully we will come to choose Him.   I heard a priest talking about how he got up in front of all these guys at his Catholic high school and questioned them. "Does God exist?" They would answer "Yes" but then when he asked them "How do you know?" none could come up with a sufficient answer. When someone finally asked him how he knew that God exists, he gave the response, "Because I know Him."    I think people should not so much ask for a "proof that God exists," but rather they should realize that the possibility oh His existence demands their time energy and respect, at the very least for awhile, so they can really devout themselves to a personal search for God.    I feel lucky because I've been raised Catholic and never really had a strong disbelief in God, and at the times when I have really acted in my faith, I have felt the presence of God and at least come to know Him in some ways. My experience is my proof.|`|4QizPDQNaa	I believe He does. As far as proving that God exists, well, I think there is enough evidence to come to that conclusion (I see the complexity of the universe and everything in it as evidence of an intelligent creator. I see the surprising agreement on basic standards of morality among nearly every people group as evidence of some higher standard to which we feel obligated to adhere) but it simply cannot be proved in the scientific sense of the word. There comes a point when, given the evidence, one must make a decision to either have faith and believe, or not believe. One could argue proofs and theories all day long, but the final decision is a personal one. There is one book that I think makes a very good case for the existence of God, called "Mere Christianity" by C.S. Lewis. Even those who may disagree with him cannot deny that his reasoning is very clear.|`|GS4IklLSaa	We're here, aren't we?  :)

But i also like NEW MOON. Because:    1)Edward comes back and stays.  2)Because he tells her everything [How he left for her and he always loved her]  3)Because the happy ending  4)Because You feel so much better..    I liked the book but i also didnt..|`|2992c9f572b21b27b8cb0f9e0f893ddaaa	I'm not very foudn fo New moon, i loved Twilight but when i read New moon i was so upset and disapointed even though it was a happy ending.

Napoleon had spies in all ranks and orders, he watched his allies, amnestied individuals and foreigners. By having a secret police he made sure that noone was conspiring against him. He also controlled information media, manipulated plebiscites to consolidate his personal authority. he brought parliamentary life to an end and expressed contempt for intellectuals who defended democracy...Joseph II was not successful because he did not safe-guard his power as well as Napoleon did...Joseph II did not have a secret police to eliminate his enemies/dissenters.  by the way how can you believe that napoleon was an ideal enlightened despot when under his napoleonic code women lost all of their right and gains achieved during the french revolution.?|`|bdnMQnVHaa	The revolution in France started from the bottom up.  The people of France rebelled against the king and the nobles.  Napoleon was not a noble.  He rose through the military ranks.  The nobility had been run out of the country or killed.  That is why enlightened ideas were more permanent in France.    Joseph II tried to start from the top down.  He introduced enlightened ideas into Austria, but alienated the nobility and clergy.  There was no revolution of the people to back up his ideas.  When he died the new government reserved much of what he had done.  The Austrian populous was complacent.

To quote Chuchill in reference to the Germans, "they are either at your throats or at your feet" meaning to deal with the Germans would take nothing less than a full mobilization of Allied Forces and to utterly crush the Germans into submission which is exactly what the Allies did. Hitler very much wished to avoid a two front war, Churchill knew this and led Hitler to believe that the main assault would come from Southern Europe. He also let Hitler bleed out his troops and munitions on the Eastern Front until they ran out of men and weaponry. By 1944, when D-Day commenced the Gremans knew it was a matter of time before the war would come to an end which it did a year later.
ceBTTCPwaa	Tess of the d'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented is a novel by Thomas Hardy, first published in 1891. It initially appeared in a censored and serialised version, published by the British illustrated newspaper, The Graphic. It is Hardy's penultimate novel, followed by Jude the Obscure. Though now considered a great classic of English literature, the book received mixed reviews when it first appeared, in part because it challenged the sexual morals of Hardy's day.    http://www.bookrags.com/Tess_of_the_d%27...    http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tess/    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tess/    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...    http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...    http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...    http://summarycentral.tripod.com/tessoft...|`|xJoMSkI5aa	"And take the Complete Fortune-Teller to the outhouse" [] The  ...

sQsl1r5Yaa	"Military rule has reared its head in Costa Rica from time to time, though it has not been marked by the sort of violent extremism that has occurred elsewhere in Central America. In 1870, when General Tomas Guardia seized control of the government, he made some of the country's most progressive reforms in education, military policy, and taxation.     The Costa Rican civil war erupted in 1948, after incumbent Dr. Rafael Angel Calderon and the United Social Christian Party refused to relinquish power after losing the presidential election. An exile named Jose Maria (Don Pepe) Figueres Ferrer managed to defeat Calderon in about a month, and he later proved to be one of Costa Rica's most influential leaders, as head of the Founding Junta of the Second Republic of Costa Rica.     Under Ferrer's leadership, the Junta made vast reforms in policy and civil rights. Women and blacks gained the vote, the communist party was banned, banks were nationalized, and presidential term limits established. Ferrer was immensely popular, creating a political legacy that firmly cemented Costa Rica's liberal democratic values.     In 1987, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez garnered world recognition when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in ending the Nicaraguan civil war. During that conflict, both the Sandanistas and the Contras set up military bases in the northern area of Costa Rica, and Arias was elected under the promise that he would work to put an end to this situation. He was able to get all five Central American presidents to sign his peace plan, and Nicaragua is now experiencing relative stability."

AA10729675	In history, it is not relevant whether you like a subject or not.  what is relevant in history is:  the periods within which a great change took place.  the causes for that change  the results of that change  objectivity  precise dates  precise names  precise geographical divisions  precise political divisions on the geographical map (mountains, rivers, etc... belonged to whom?  Who wanted to take them from whom and why?)  economy systems.    So certain periods present major changes and interest a lot of people like:  Cyrus the Great starting with just about 100 knights and then conquering the whole of Iran (bigger than it is now).  Alexander the Great starting an expedition at the end of 22 and changing the whole aspect of the world for all western European people.  Napoleon taking a devastated France and making it a great country,in fact a superpower at the time  Charlemagne unifiying Europe in the chaos of the Middle Ages    These are event mainly caused by one great man.    There are matters of history due to the change of climate    Matters of history that are being discovered right now by archaelogists.    Everything is indeed interesting, fascinating.  Too much for one person, though, so historians have to choose the period they feel the most comfortable with according to their center of interest: modern times, Middle-Eastern countries, communist countries, and so on.  Even with that, they have to delimitate a narrower scope.  A matter that is of vast interest right now is the influence of Ancient Iran (or Persia) on the whole of history that followed.    The influence of the Roman empire on our western minds is also a biggy.    The 1947 separation of Pakistan and India is a super biggy.  Because Pakistan is what Ancient India was, with the Indus Valley.  It is just as if a country had lost its roots, or its heart!      Good luck!

Nobody else did.|`|ky3B42f6aa	For you, it is ancient history.  For me, it was yesterday.  Hitler's "Third Reich" needed somewhere to expand.  Poland looked like a good "first choice".  So, Hitler arranged a setup, first he had some Poles shot, then he dressed them up in German uniforms, then he "showed the world" how the Poles had attacked his border personnel.  THAT was his excuse to invade Poland.  Besides, he had a secret deal with Stalin to divide the country between them.  Poland did not stand a chance.  Hitler also bet on the fact that England and France would not honor their promise to come to the aid of Poland.  Ouch, was he wrong!  After that, all hell broke loose.  England and France declared war on Germany.   For quite a few months, unfortunately, nothing happened.  During this "time out", Germany drastically increased its "war machine".  If both England and France had attacked at once, Hitler and his "not-quite-prepared-army" would have been wiped out.  But, England was not prepared much either, having put all its hopes on appeasement.  And so it went.... from bad to worse to even worser.|`|ZDrXFS2daa	He had some of his soldiers dress up in Polish uniforms and shoot at Germans so he could have a reason to attack Poland.

AA10729675	Knights have the reputation of being poor.  But a rich knight having property and serfs working for him can be a lord, not because he is a knight but because he owns property and serfs.  In general, this did not happen because knights had to fight in battles and could not take care of property, this is why they were poor.  But rewards for a good fight could give them property, this is why they endangered their own life in battles.|`|yWoBYJVEaa	No, not unless he had been granted a title, as well as been accepted (or set himself up) as a knight.  A knight would be addressed as "Sir" rather than "Lord".    You do not have to be a Knight or hold a Peerage (literally, be a Peer of the Realm), in order to own property.    You do not have to be a Knight to be a Peer.      See below...    Lord is a title with various meanings. It can denote a prince or a feudal superior (especially a feudal tenant who holds directly from the king, i.e., a baron). The title today is mostly used in connection with the peerage of the United Kingdom or its predecessor countries, although some users of the title do not themselves hold peerages, and use it 'by courtesy'.     Five ranks of peer exist in the United Kingdom, in descending order, these are: duke, marquess, earl, viscount, and baron. The title 'Lord' is used most often by barons who are rarely addressed with any other. The style of this address is 'Lord (X)', for example, Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, is commonly known as 'Lord Tennyson'. The ranks of marquess, earl and viscounts commonly use lord as well, with viscounts using the same style as used for baron.     In feudalism, a lord has aristocratic rank, has control over a portion of land and the produce and labour of the serfs living thereon. Knights or lesser lords would swear the oath of fealty to the lord, and would then become a vassal.    Knight is the English term for a social position originating in the Middle Ages. In the Commonwealth of Nations, knighthood is a non-heritable form of gentry    Military-monastic orders  For more details on this topic, see Military order.     The Seal of the Knights TemplarKnights Hospitaller, founded during the First Crusade, 1099   Order of Saint Lazarus established about 1100   Knights Templar, founded 1118, disbanded 1307   Teutonic Knights, established about 1190, and ruled the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights in Prussia until 1525   Other orders were established in the Iberian peninsula, under the influence of the orders in the Holy Land and the Crusader movement of the Reconquista:    the Order of Aviz, established in Avis in 1143   the Order of Alcntara, established in Alcntara in 1156   the Order of Calatrava, established in Calatrava in 1158   the Order of Santiago, established in Santiago in 1164.     [edit] Chivalric orders  For more details on this topic, see Chivalric order.  After the Crusades, the military orders became idealized and romanticized, resulting in the late medieval notion of chivalry, as reflected in the Arthurian romances of the time. The creation of chivalric orders was fashionable among the nobility in the 14th and 15th centuries, and this is still reflected in contemporary honours systems, including the term order itself. Examples of notable orders of chivalry are:    the Order of Saint George founded by Charles I of Hungary in 1325/6   the Order of the Garter founded by Edward III of England around 1348 - motto: Honi soit qui mal y pense, "Shame on those who think evil of it"   the Order of the Dragon of St. George founded by Milos Obilic around 1370   the Order of the Dragon founded by king Sigismund of Luxemburg in 1408   the Order of the Golden Fleece founded by Philip III, Duke of Burgundy in 1430   the Order of Saint Michael founded by Louis XI of France in 1469   the Order of the Thistle   the Order of the Elephant   the Order of the Bath - motto: Tria iuncta in uno, "Three things joined in one"   From roughly 1560, purely honorific orders were established, as a way to confer prestige and distinction, unrelated to military service and chivalry in the more narrow sense. Such orders were particularly popular in the 17th and 18th centuries, and knighthood continues to be conferred in various countries:    The United Kingdom (see British honours system) and some Commonwealth of Nations countries;   Some European countries, such as The Netherlands and Russia (see below).   The Holy See  see Papal Orders of Chivalry.   There are other monarchies and also republics that also follow this practice. Modern knighthoods are typically awarded in recognition for services rendered to society: services which are not necessarily martial in nature. The British musician Elton John, for example, is a Knight Bachelor, thus entitled to be called Sir Elton. The female equivalent is a Dame.        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight|`|644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	Of course.

JPlVt9xYaa	I have never lost my love for any reason. I lost both my parents, but not my love for them. I have had my best friend walk out of my life, but I did not lose my love for my friend. My love grows for all of mankind and without regard to trying to control the way they feel about me. my love is unconditional but also very personal. You can give love and then take it back, it is your personal growth whether that person accepts in or not. All my love and my loves belong to me and do me great kindness and provides for my inner growth.|`|AA12316366	i don't, what's gone is gone. new horizons|`|GNXqjKngaa	I've once heard the phrase that a paper bag eventually molds to the shape of the object it contains.

vmmMqhxXaa	Read The Magician's Nephew, in which Diggory Kirk and Polly Plummer witness the creation of the world of Narnia.  Then compare it to the creation story in Genesis 1, and the prologue to the Gospel of John.  If you really want to have fun, look at some other creation stories from places like ancient Sumeria and ancient Greece (see links below).|`|nBuUfUdkaa	Read the Magician's Nephew, it will take you about a day to read it.  This book focuses on the creation of Narnia and the history of Aslan.  One thing you should know is that C.S. Lewis was a Christian author.  All his books are loaded with symbolism.  So each book in the Narnia series symbolizes an aspect of Christianity.|`|4FWrRRF2aa	Narnia is just a story. We all know that Earth was created by the eight stringed flying spaghetti monster. So you need to compare and contrast fiction with fact.
7VpDEkC6aa	I'm not quite sure what you mean by the knob is "UP"     from what it sounds like you have just popped the knob off the shaft, or cracked the inside of the knob so that it's no longer tight on the shaft.    Go ahead and gently try to pry it all the way off and inspect the Hole/tunnel...whateveryoucallit  that fits over the potentiometer shaft.    Also try turning the shaft by itself without the knob on it.  I don't know what that control does...but if it still doesn't work, then it's probably gone bad on you.  If it does work, and the knob is not stripped out or cracked, go ahead and just push it back down on the shaft.  If the knob itself is broken, try to order a knob form Ibanez, or go to a Radio Shack  or guitar shop with your guitar and try to find a knob you can replace it with. There are tons of knobs to buy out there. I'm sure you could find one that would fit OK.      If you still have no luck, ask about your problem at the Ibanez forum:  http://forum.ibanez.com|`|r9s0VyJgaa	You don't.  You take it to a guitar repair person and let them do it.
62xF9GScaa	Canada was a more confident nation in the 50's than in the 20's. It was less a part of the 'British Empire' and more a nation that defined itself by its own actions.     The Suez crisis of 1956 was a good example of this. Canada refused to resell arabian oil to Britain which was under an embargo until it withdrew its troops. Canada also suggested the eventual solution of sending in troops under UN command to act as impartal peacekeepers. This would have probably been unthinkable 30 years ago.

A guitar is a piece of wood with strings on it. Unless it was a 2000 dollar guitar.   But if you're bitching about a crappy 300 dollar Ibanez or something you need to get a life and music is not your thing.   No musician wants to play with an immature primadonna like you.

Thousands prayed. Cats did not return"|`|ulQEXb1yaa	Interesting *star*    I like this poem, it's thought provoking, I'm not sure I entirely understand your point but I like it anyway.

JyXfC3IGaa	No, I don't believe it's a book.
F2jJu5CMaa	i love breaking dawn, i think renesme makes their love stronger. I think the ending that has been given to the book is perfect.   Renesmee is hardly a burden to them as jacob will be there with her when bella and edward can't.   All through the books Edwards and bella's relationship has been pivitol, with all the fights and worries it's refreshing to see that their love has not been affected by that but has been made stronger.|`|zSEs5kUqaa	I didn't like her having them having a baby. I also didn't like the ending. The war should have went through. You just don't gather that many people and nothing happen. It's crazy. She built up so much anticipation it was ridiculous. Nothing happend. It was so cliche.     They lived Happily Ever After....The End...|`|njppcqO8aa	i feel cheated because i can't stand Nessie. i feel that their love should be just them and throwing a kid, Jacob imprinting and everything just makes it a bad ending. i wish they could keeping going on loving each other forever instead of having to be teen parents.|`|w0ZGxfJJaa	Because. They need more Twilight!|`|kOHI6vl9aa	I felt cheated because Stephine Meyer finished it off too quickly.. Like with J.K Rowling and the Deathly Hallows the ending was hurried. That pissed me... -_-|`|RaUndRx8aa	I think they feel cheated because it was all set up for this epic battle and then they just talked it out. And a lot of people think the ending really sucks because it's to cheesy since everyone has a happy ending.  I liked it personally they all deserve to be happy and I loved the way the book ends... With Edward being able to hear bella's thoughts I thought it was so perfect!    Some people are never happy the book was a great way to end the saga if you ask me :)         |`|G4iHDhpvaa	I loved it too but i was disappointed that it was all happily ever after! No one died, no one was even hurt! Bella got everything. Edward, Jacob, Nessie , Charlie, Renee she even got her human friends! She didn't have to loose anything! There was nothing that she had to give up! She got to become immortal, but get all the human stuff as well. I mean although i love all the books she could easily have skipped eclipse  and nothing would have changed.|`|Y6gQYbrwaa	oh the whole "the end" thing. usually, good authors stay away from saying "the end"  and im saying USUALLY    and at the end, with the whole "edward finally reading bella's mind" i mean the whole thing throughout the 4 books was that edward COULDNT read her mind.    and the whole Nessie thing.    ugh.|`|KyNWIXQeaa	I think it was because we expected a bigger finale. The fight was built up so much and it amounted to nothing. And after the fight it was like bam bam done. I would have liked a little more of them with Renesmee, thier cottage, etc. Like have the big fight in more of the middle of the book and more time after the fight to get some plot holes cleared up and to get to know Nessie a little better.|`|Zq8cU1Kdaa	I would not say that I felt cheated. But, and this can be said about many books, I felt that the last three books were for a very large part only written for the readers.    Twilight itself was a book which, when written, only proved to one person (or some close friends) that the story of Edward and Bella existed.    But then fame came up and a wave of crazy fans took the Twilight and shone their crazed light on it. Twilight turned to light and to mainstream...    For me, only the first book would have been enough. I admit, I bought and read the other three too but it is somehow the same as Harry Potter. Or do you honestly think it ended the way it did because the authors had these endings in their mind all the time?     *Spoiler - don't read on*                          Or rather becaus people stick to happy endings??|`|AA10407839	Well first of all, Bella got pregnant! like come on how does that work really?     Okay so you get over that and think oh look she gets to be a vampire, lets see the crazy newborn. But no, everything is just way too easy for her, she just immediately gains control, gets to see Charlie again and Jacob is totally okay with her tranformation (i know he imprinted that why) and she has no lovey feelings for him. It's just too perfect that all her worries get solved with minimal effort really.    Then they get a huge problem and there's this big lead up to a fight that just does not happen. Personally I was expecting action and was really disappointed that there wasnt even a little bit.

6SwaWSoyaa	You see I hate it when people don't give rats *** about the music they are playing; however, I hate it when people accuse my section and I of not caring. My friend Elizabeth and I play a tuba, and our low brass section gets a lot of crap all the time because people accuse us of not trying when we aren't able to get back to our spots as fast and stuff, or in fundamental block when we are complaining after holding our instruments in attention for about five minutes. However when a trumpet or a clarinet does it they complain and stuff, I find it ridiculous. Then we say something to them about it and then they tell us that we complain more than they do. Why is all of this confusion? Well they don't realize that we are carrying a nearly 60 pound instrument and one of the most awkward holding positioned instrument at that. If our instruments were petite; maybe we would be at our spots across the field faster or maybe our muscles wouldn't be cramped by the time we are done. However it does build muscle up so that part is always good.  Or as a senior I hate when people still accuse me of not caring because I don't believe in screaming at the underclassmen if they make a mistake. When I was an underclassmen that only pissed me off and convinced me not to do anything and made me had a bad attitude. Then the other seniors got mad at us when all the underclassmen liked us and cooperated with us when we helped them with their music, horn positions, etc......so aggravating. I hate when people tell me that I don't care about something that I love, because it is ruins it for me.  Now when it comes to not caring about the music, I hate that!!! In concert and marching band. It is one thing to look bad, but to sound bad is a whole other problem. The purpose of being in band is to sound great and to be entertaining and when people come in there and just constantly goof off or purposely mess up, I feel they need to be kicked out no matter how small the band is.    I am going to leave you because I don't want to type your head off and I am sure this comment is long enough. By the way what instrument do you play?|`|gM03eKTJaa	Yes, it drives me mad! This happened in my band too; one year we had two awesome euphos, then they graduated and we were stuck with two idiots who only showed up half the time. Really, they shouldn't be there, but that's up to your conductor. The sad this is that it shows in performance and lets the whole band down. They should really consider their place in the band, especially if there are others players who want those seats.|`|AWHVwtIkaa	Yes!    I had that problem all the time in high school, half the people in there didn't want to be there but their parents made them stick with it so they never put any real effort into the music we played!    I'm assuming you mean in high school? Usually people in higher levels actually want to be there therefore they try. I play trombone in my college and we all play to the best of our abilities so the end product isn't just notes and rhythms and rather a full musical experience. Wow that sounded really band-nerdy! haha.     But yes, I hear you loud and clear!|`|X32heVmHaa	Yes...it bugs the crap outa me!!! LOL  A lot of clarinets in my school's band don't put any effort forth!
2P5WRadhaa	"Shallow People" I Agree with you! People get upset over soap-opera scenarios....some have even committed suicide when a player is written out by death or an accident.  Some have actually stood in churches where I've pastored and requested prayer for their favorite soap star who is "gravely" ill, another became emotionally distraught because "Sarah" died. My! My! My! Wake up people, if you're gonna get emotional, get emotional about something real... JESUS DIED! He died for you! That's something to get emotional about, not, soap stars, or broken nails, burnt toast or spilled milk. Life is real! It has something to offer! There is actually good things worth standing for and fighting for. Who cares about matching accessories when there's a world of dying, starving diseased, hurting people? Your discomfort pales in light of wars, death, disease,and a hopeless economy. Quit hiding from reality and life behind superficial nonsense.

Apart from that though, very well written!|`|NR6y68U3aa	It's very good, I like  the first stanza  which describes instant gratification very well.  Then you have tied the second stanza and the following stanzas with our inability to value the knowledge and wisdom with our elders.  With the last stanza you have brought it full circle with acknowledging the two main ideas of the poem.   Very good, keep writing because you have a talent.|`|B4kf9jDGaa	I really like this one.(another great one!)When I read it I was reminded of a question I wrote awhile ago, about why do people joke about suicide?(and/or death)It's not funny, and really needs to be taken seriously, and your poem states that very well.

I suggest you go to   your news agent and get or order a copy of "The Stage".  I think you will find it very help full|`|9NQ5DHBJaa	im allso looking for an agent atm let me no when u find one|`|GhJ3SB0Eaa	if she wants to act sign her up for plays. because if she really loves acting she'll like doing that and she wont just be doing it for the fame.|`|6tzT8GFqaa	i think that insted of finding an agent for your daughter which is very hard to do. You should just enroll her into amature performances or put her into a after school drama club. If it has to be on TV or in films it is likely she just wants to do it for the fame, if this si true then she will never be sucsessful in the acting world.
TbTO5SXlaa	Most real camera stores (a store that only sells cameras, not 10,001 other things and cameras) should have a filter removal tool under the counter. Once they remove the stuck filter, buy a new one from them.|`|AA12185092	I don't think Ritz has their own technicians; they send cameras out to a repair center. If there's a camera repair shop with an on-site technician near you they will probably do it faster and cheaper than Ritz.|`|PWwKcjwFaa	Get a needlenose plier and bend the thin strip of aluminum that's holding the filter, outwards towards the edge. Then remove the glass, and with a thicker plier bend the filter inwards - try to buckle it so it's "loose." After some wrangling, you should be able to unscrew it. If that doesn't work, try using a dremel? I had to do the same thing last night with my mamiya lens.    Of course, the filter will be destroyed, and do it carefully as not to damage the filter threads on the lens, and finally I'm not responsible for any damages.|`|AJopJTuxaa	Hi    Use a very thin elastic and wrap it around the filter. It will come off. The elastic gives you extra strength and momentum to remove it once force is applied . Don't worry, you cannot damage anything and secondly, the filter is already damaged LOL..

E01qYov5aa	I tend to start my research on Ancestry.co.uk, I also find LDS very helpful - they keep fairly accurate and extensive records so you may be able to find something there.   Beyond that I head to the library/internet - I look into local newspapers, or often there are books made that detail the local history - your family may be mentioned in one.   After you've exhausted everything you can do from your computer/phone the best thing may be to organize a trip to the local archives office or parish church.|`|ENgAgejwaa	I recommend using http://www.familysearch.org there are quite a few Bicknells  on there also some Corbet's.Just put the surname in & England from the drop down box.

Just a few examples for you.|`|an1b4pXxaa	Wills are one possibility - before 1858 online here    http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/docum...    Not much use if your ancestor was an ag lab without two pennies to rub together though.|`|AA11394457	I recommend using Familysearch.org, you can always confirm any results that you find there, which pre-1837 are mostly church records.      Most churches have a website this days, with a contact address.  You could ask them about the records before you set on a wildgoose chase.|`|78Xb7enMaa	I would join Genes Reunited and get easy access to Census' and other peoples family trees.

AA10269742	like the one person said, i wouldnt call it obsession, but determination...i'm the same way, except i'm not really worried about being published, i just want to write, and if what i write happens to get published, then that would be cool, if not, i can share it with family and friends who'll appreciate it just the same...|`|8asG4WCwaa	Ask yourself if your obession is preventing you from being able to care for yourself properly.  That's the line you don't want to cross.    If you can't even be bothered to go to the bathroom because you're too busy editing the same sentance over and over again, well, yeah, that might be a mental issue :-)|`|Bim31Zoaaa	Nah, it's fine.    You're not alone in that dream. Some people might call it obsession. I call it determination.|`|5478d54ea53fcef0ef93502a7e237c89aa	It isn't healthy to be obsessed with anything.  That doesn't mean you shouldn't concentrate on accomplishing something that you hope to do.   But you won't get there by "thinking about it a LOT".  You have to DO SOMETHING.   If you want to be a published novelist, start writing.|`|5wg7tKc6aa	That doesn't make any sense.  Would I have a mental issue if I was obsessed with music, and my highest ambition was to become a musician?  No, you're just doing what you like, and want to pursue a career in that area.    As a matter of fact, it's perfectly healthy to feel as you do about something as unique as writing.    Don't worry.  You're healthy.  I can tell yout hat much, and I'm not even a doctor.|`|PRZkv1xbaa	I'm a writer with 5 books out and one to come out later this week.

ahjqc9Ifaa	Yes. I have one I'm trying to get an agent for--but it's my fifth novel. The learning curve is steep, but you keep at it, you climb it.    I'm 100,000 words or so into number six--but my first drafts throw in everything, then I pare away a bunch in a rewrite.|`|cBltTxPyaa	I was so totally in your shoes not too long ago. And at one point in my rewrite/revise process, I was just like, "When is this ever going to stop?" Because I could rewrite and rewrite and rewrite as much as I wanted and still never think it was perfect enough.     Here's a tip for the rewriting/revising process, make sure you stay true to the true nature of the story and how you viewed it in your head.  When it is just as you envisioned it in the beginning, you've done as much as you can do as far as revising and rewriting things.     :)    I began by writing a novel, got about halfway through, things weren't working out, so I shifted over to a screenplay. I've finished it and am entering it into a contest in March!  Hopefully it doesn't end there! :)    Good luck with your writing!!!!|`|E28mQDX0aa	I wrote two back when I was 14, and they were both complete crap (though, one was slightly better than the other). But, they were both pretty bad... I can't believe that I thought they were good when I wrote them. I'm almost done with the rewrite of one and just started the rewrite of the other one. I'm going to try to get one published once I finish it and possibly rewrite it since I'm not happy with the current rewrite. I will hopefully be getting it published once I'm done editing it.    I sent in a short story to a literary magazine back in December and I'm hoping that they accept it, if they do, then I can be officially published and actually have some credentials when I query agents when I want to publish my book.|`|iHtskXisaa	Yes.  I completed my first novel in the mid-'90's.  I submitted it to one publishing house the week before it was bought out by another one.  The second one (which I'll abbreviate as WOC) was rude, unprofessional, and simply appalling to deal with.  I got tired of WOC and rewrote my own manuscript.  About 9 months later, WOC wanted to publish my novel.  I told them to go to Hell, and they returned it.  I gave up on fiction some time later and worked in non-fiction.      I recently returned to fiction, and the newest version of my novel is now at another publisher.  I'm half-done with a second fantasy novel, and I'm starting my first science fiction novel.|`|245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	Yeah, but it was REALLY BAD. 22 chapters of crap. It was a while ago, though. And my life would need to be threatened before I would even consider publishing it.|`|AA11042261	I have completed one novel and am currently shopping it around to agents. I am working on a second novel as well.    I think the first one isn't bad, but it definitely has a select audience and would not appeal to the general reading public.
AA10025824	Yes.  Why not?    There was a book written in English entirely without "E"'s.  The writer taped down the E key on his typewriter and each time he needed it he found a different word.  It was published just because it was weird.  Ernest Vincent Wright - Gadsby (1939)    Go for it.|`|CnM2U1bXaa	You might, i think that it really depends on how good the novel is. i highly doubt it though. i would stick to normal writting|`|Xc02z608aa	nope, unless it was a pig latin dictionary LOL.|`|Jpgz4mSVaa	lol, ell-way i'd-ay uy-bay it-ay!|`|5wg7tKc6aa	That's too strenuous for the reader, you wouldn't sell much IF you got it published.  But it could happen.|`|AA12384115	No, you won't get very many interested readers.    Pig Latin may be alright for a sentence or two but, after a few paragraphs, it would just be annoying.|`|AV9h7Dikaa	no.  I would not read that crap.|`|KHNBcsdkaa	If you were publishing it as a code book type, sure, but probably not normally. You should definitely try, though, I think it would be hilarious, and provide a challenge to readers.|`|1S5x33ytaa	no affence but that is just down write weerd man who would want to read a book in pig lattin.|`|yMRY5cgxaa	ya if pigs could fly not unless it is a work of supreme worthiness and if it is they'd unpiglatin it and publish it...|`|FSe19uT6aa	I think it's a cool idea, but don't think it would sell well. I suppose it depends on what your book is about; if it's about Pig Latin, or if it's, say, fiction.
BuJClF3Faa	1.   I didn't really expect it, all though I thought something might have been going on with them that I wasn't quite sure of, so in a way, I did expect it. I think they might have been Bisexual, which means they like both men and women. That would make more sense about her handsome knight. Felicity had many male suitors, but that doesn't mean she WANTED them. It just means they liked her.   2.   Miss McCleethy was of the Order, Fowlson was Rakshana. It's explained that the Caves of Sighs were where the Order and Rakshana would come as lovers.  3.   I think she actually might have wanted to move on. His death was very painful for her, and I actually wonder if it would have caused her more pain to see him imprisoned in the tree.    I think this might be the quote you're looking for, I have the book right here with me because of another question:     "Gemma, you see how it is. They've planned our entire lives, from what we shall wear to whom we shall marry and where we shall live. It's one lump of sugar in your tea whether you like it or not and you'd best smile even if you're dying deep inside. We're like pretty horses, and just as on horses, they mean to put blinders on us so we can't look left or right by only straight ahead where they would lead"      EDIT: Sabrina, you probably haven't finished Rebel Angels yet, have you? Miss McCleethy actually ISN'T Circe, as the girls suspect. And Fowlson is a MAN, he's Rakshana. :)|`|O9HLoDj9aa	I did suspect the Felicity/Pippa thing. Just because Felicity talked about all the male suitors she had made me even more suspicious. In those times, it wasn't right to be different, so she probably wanted to keep it a secret by talking about males all the time. Miss Fowlson was a member of the Order, and wanted the power back in the Order's hands. Miss McCleethy was Circe.|`|CvkuzcpDaa	hey.....just wanted to say...i didnt get the whole pippa felicity thing either|!!!! and the ending was too sad....why the hell couldnt it have ended nicely?? why??? !"!! lol...xx:|`|gq5sfgE5aa	1. I totally didn't see it coming!!!    2.I dunno, most of the story didn't really make sense to me.    3. Maybe secretly she kew to trust no one....oooohh!    Yeah, the book was ok but I don't think it flowed really well. It was kind of broken up and sorta random. They jumped between situations too fast so it was kind of hard to follow what was going on and happening to one character.  I did like the book though and sorry I couldn't help.
fLHV3pmuaa	"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" by Robert Frost    Whose woods these are I think I know.   His house is in the village though;  He will not see me stopping here  To watch his woods fill up with snow.    My little horse must think it queer  To stop without a farmhouse near  Between the woods and frozen lake  The darkest evening of the year.    He gives his harness bells a shake  To ask if there is some mistake.  The only other sound's the sweep  Of easy wind and downy flake.    The woods are lovely, dark and deep.  But I have promises to keep,  And miles to go before I sleep,  And miles to go before I sleep.

iNXqiDIYaa	can't find a book called that - do you mean "The Vampire Diaries" series?    If yes - brief plot summaries of the 4 books here    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vampire...
FSe19uT6aa	I hadn't heard of The Year of the Fog, but if you like fantasy I have to suggest the His Dark Materials series by Philip Pullman and The Bartimaeus trilogy by Jonathan Stroud, of course. They're some of the best series I've read.    The Wind Singer (it's the first book of a trilogy) by William Nicholson is at the very top of my favorite books list. It's a very original and interesting read.     Ysable by Guy Gavriel Kay mixes history and fantasy into our modern world with brilliantly detailed (but far from boring) writing. I'm reading this right now and so far it's amazing.     The Inheritance cycle by Christopher Paolini is sometimes (okay... maybe a little more then just sometimes) unoriginal, but the story draws you in and I think it's worth reading.     I just finished reading the companion book (Rebel Angels) to A Great and Terrible Beauty (which I should have read first), by Libba Bray. It's set in Victorian England, a magical boarding school type story with the fill of romance. I really didn't think I'd like it, but Rebel Angels was simply excellent.    Avielle of Rhia by Dina Calhoun has been one of my favorites for quite a few years. The world it's set in is wonderfully thought out.     Amelia Atwater-Rhodes has some interesting vampire and shapeshifter books. They're light reads.    And if you can read the older writing, I highly recommend The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien for fantasy and Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront? for romance.    Hope you find some good reads!|`|LzPhdri5aa	InkHeart.  On Basilisk Station.  Ender's Game.

She looked like everyone else, dressed like everyone else, harbored hopes and dreams...you guessed it, just like everyone else.    After a long and uneventful winter break, Sidney returned to the stale hallways and cranky teachers to find a new addition: a mysterious new student named Cael, he seemed to immediately fall into the role of the most popular person to ever step foot on campus. At first, Sidney was repulsed by the gaggle of girls that hung on his every word, that is, until he explained that he has no control over the attraction others have for him, its just one thing out of many that he is just as confused about as she is. Cael knows what he is, but he has no idea how or why. Their search for answers sends them across the world and forces them to go to extreme measures in order to get those answers.    City of Dreams (non-vampire related romance) by Stefanie Ellis:    Skyler Ashford is a confused, over-analyzing twenty-five year old. She escapes a small town and bad relationship, winding up in New York City. She hopes to start over fresh and become someone new. Instead, she stumbles across a man. A man she hasnt seen since high school, a man who always held her heart. However, things have changed for him, hes become a world renowned figure in the world of entertainment. Skyler wonders how much fame has altered the man she once loved, and shes determined to find out.

Here were some things that weren't so great in B.D.  1.Bella becomes a sex maniac.  2.Jacob's perspective.  3.Pregnancy.  4.No fight at the end.  5.Renesmee-the perfect child.  6.It's too perfect. No one important dies. Bella gets a child, relationship with Jacob and her dad, has TWO superpowers(super-self control and shield), and a lovey-dovey happy ending. Couldn't Jacob have died, at least?    I wish SM could have continued the series. I'm not sure if there is a way to contact her, though.|`|43aa681185941d99ecd9099b4183ec6daa	why should stephenie meyer have to rewrite the story just because a few people didnt like it ?  she's the writer, not you. it was your choice to read it, and of course everyone's going to have different opinions about the book.  she can write her stories just how she wants to, and its really not her problem whether you thought it sucked or not.  i think breaking dawn was a perfect ending to the sequel, and yeah it would have been nice to hear more about bella and edward's life, but it was her choice to end it, so just live with it.   if you were so dissapointed, why don't you rewrite breaking dawn the way you wanted it to be?  just be thankful you for the twilight saga, don't complain so much.|`|WshwHtk9aa	Are you serious?    You want a writer to rewrite her book and deny the original because YOU didn't like it as much as you had hoped you would? How vain are you? I mean, I had some problems with the ending from a story-telling point-of-view (I thought it felt forced and not natural to the story), but it is her book and she can do what she wants with it. If you don't like it, don't read it.    When have you EVER heard of an author rewriting a book to appease fans with little-to-no storytelling experience?    The book was an international best-seller that made her millions and got a movie deal, so apparently she did SOMETHING right with it.    You don't like it, learn to write and tell your own stories.|`|ZaBGMT12aa	Breaking Dawn was a joke. I'm not even sure she could fix it.    The problem is with the entire series.

lZrDPTzYaa	I think Mockingbird is also a coming of age story. So the characters being children makes sense as it traces their transition from being naive, innocent children to young adults who realizes the world isn't black and white and good always triumphs.|`|i4ceTwqLaa	Using children is the perfect way to express the experience through unbiased and objective eyes.    Because they are children, we can trust their narratives not to be replete with bias and opinion.|`|W4C5p8qOaa	Well it means that the kids don't have any preconceptions or prejudices against people. It also shows how unreasonable and unfounded these preconceptions really are, and gives the characters a kind of innocence that wouldn't be achieved if they were any older. It means that the story is told in a factual balanced way, and that accounts of the events are made to seem more reliable, because the children wouldn't have any reason to skew them.  I agree, it's a great book, I'm studying it in English at the moment.|`|0pkAvVF2aa	It shows the loss of innocence and as Jem and Scout learn life through terrible experiences that they probably would never understand until they got older. It kinda makes the story easier to see without the harsh opinions of adults and with the nonjudgmental eyes of children.|`|fGHYhA4Iaa	Yes, i also believe it has a coming of age concept. But also i think she based it off of maybe what she experienced as a child, or maybe the scottsboro trials.|`|ckg1Rancaa	HAHAHAHAHA IM SOOOO GLAD YOU ASKED!!    just finnished studying it for GCSE the reason why it is seen through the eyes of children is the theme on inncocence seeing it through scouts eyes just shows how things are before inturrupted by adulthood you'll also notice there's alot of hypocrisy too and scout sees this it just puts across the subject of innocence, the mockingbird theme, there's the question who is the mockingbird, is it boo radley is it tom robinson, is it the children       its a truely wonderful book, inpiring to say the least, everybody thinks differently after reading it, you start to see people differently, see why they act the way they do, you deal with people differently. everybody should read it one of my favourites i must say    ENJOY IT!|`|hD4zBeafaa	She wanted a child's point of view.

No they were not !! Thailand had no forces in Vietnam, but merely allowed it's airports and hospitals to be used by US forces.      And you forgot the French and Japanese. This conflict really started back in the 1920's and escalated with the Viet Minh attack on the French.    Japan swept through in WW2, French left, WW2 ended, French returned and they got their butts kicked by the Viet Minh. The DMZ was later established and then followed by invasions, skirmishes terrorist acts and so forth until Australia and US got involved in the 1950's and then all out war followed with the other countries joining in.    China only came in 1979 after the war was over when China invaded north Vietnam.

She looked like everyone else, dressed like everyone else, harbored hopes and dreams...you guessed it, just like everyone else.    After a long and uneventful winter break, Sidney returned to the stale hallways and cranky teachers to find a new addition: a mysterious new student named Cael, he seemed to immediately fall into the role of the most popular person to ever step foot on campus. At first, Sidney was repulsed by the gaggle of girls that hung on his every word, that is, until he explained that he has no control over the attraction others have for him, its just one thing out of many that he is just as confused about as she is. Cael knows what he is, but he has no idea how or why. Their search for answers sends them across the world and forces them to go to extreme measures in order to get those answers.    City of Dreams (non-vampire related romance) by Stefanie Ellis:    Skyler Ashford is a confused, over-analyzing twenty-five year old. She escapes a small town and bad relationship, winding up in New York City. She hopes to start over fresh and become someone new. Instead, she stumbles across a man. A man she hasnt seen since high school, a man who always held her heart. However, things have changed for him, hes become a world renowned figure in the world of entertainment. Skyler wonders how much fame has altered the man she once loved, and shes determined to find out.

I suppose you do need some new reading! xD    I think you'd really like A Great and Terrible Beauty by Libba Bray. It's set in Victorian England, a boarding school type story with magic and romance.    His Dark Materials series by Philip Pullman and The Bartimaeus trilogy by Jonathan Stroud are very good fantasy series.    The Wind Singer (it's the first book of a trilogy) by William Nicholson is at the very top of my favorite books list. It's a very original and interesting read.     Ysable by Guy Gavriel Kay mixes history and fantasy into our modern world with brilliantly detailed (but far from boring) writing. I'm reading this right now and so far it's amazing.     The Inheritance cycle by Christopher Paolini is sometimes (okay... maybe a little more then just sometimes) unoriginal, but the story draws you in and I think it's worth reading.     Avielle of Rhia by Dina Calhoun has been one of my favorites for quite a few years. The world it's set in is wonderfully thought out.     Amelia Atwater-Rhodes has some interesting vampire and shapeshifter books. They're light reads.    And if you can read the older writing, I highly recommend The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien for fantasy and Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront? for romance.|`|t1Lz8Ox1aa	those are my favorites too!  but these are also some of my favorites:  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld  A Great and Terrible Beauty series by Libba Bray  and...-drumroll-...  Maximum Ride series by James Patterson (these books sound pretty bad when you read the back cover; my friend forced me to read it, but they are SOOO GOOD!!!)|`|NYd9vLrBaa	INKHEART TRILOGY!!!!!!!!!|`|O2lgblIJaa	I need new books to read too! Someone suggested Lord of the rings trilogy, I wonder if they're as dreadfully long as the movie. I mean I liked the movies, but they were not like Harry Potter or Twilight which I can literally see over and over again (I must have seen each of Harry's movies at least 10 times and read the books twice already (for details). But I was not that much into the Lord of the rings movies, it was good, but just as a one time thing. Are the books any better (I know books are always better than movies, but I mean do they excite you more than the movie? I know it's not really an answer but I was looking for the same thing and decided to do a follow up question here instead of starting a new question.    I've read great books in other languages (spanish, dutch)   But as to recommend books in english I would have to say classics like Bram Stoker's Dracula, One Flew over the cookoo's nest, 1984, Animal Farm, Atonement,Jayne Eyre, The Scarlet Letter. More recent books that are worthy of recommending would be the Harry Potter series an the Twilight Saga, but you already read those...so...I guess I'm no help there.|`|2o1ciKEyaa	wildwood dancing and cybele's secret by juliet marillier are fantastic. they are very romantic and very fantasy-y and adventurous.

Ow3O7h4caa	Hi    The correct way of doing it is to start slowly and the knuckles of your right hand have to be at 45 deg angle so that the index, middle and ring finger rest on the 4-3-2 or 3-2-1 strings.    Practice picking one finger per string in this fashion.    i-m-r-i-m-r-i-m-r- etc.... and them backwards r-m-i-r-m-i etc..    also  i-m-r-m-r-i repeatedly    then    i-m-i-m-r repeatedly and backwards, r-m-r-m-i etc..    i = index    m=middle finger  a= ring finger.    Practice slowly but on time. Build up speed gradually.
hQ95u9OLaa	Hey, I like it. Her statement about "if you're not going to rape me, I have other things to do, if you don't mind." leave off the "I scowled." We already know she's not happy with the situation. In fiction the less the better.    Maybe one mention of crap instead of two. I like the "holy" but make it the s--- word. She thinks she's a grown up; let her use grown up words.   I like the "Of f------ course."   I don't think his eyebrows should furrow-he seems to be the one in charge of the situation.   Maybe, this is just my opinion "his eyes were funny, I kind of liked them. Weird, I know."   One more suggestion: I tripped over a branch and about broke my back. This is always happening to me. Wow or damn or Jeez. Thus you're like an ironic heroine. Because I take it you're a little over your head but smart.

245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	You should never describe a character all in one paragraph. These types of descriptions should be sprinkled throughout the writing. That "naturally stunning" part seems like something anyone would instantly think upon seeing this Goddess for the first time, so whoever is telling the story can mention that right away, and then some small details about the way she looks.    Things like the way her hair looks can be done with a sort of- "She sighed and fiddled with her flower-entwined braid." And that's what I mean by sprinkling descriptions throughout the writing. Your descriptions in general aren't bad, but you shouldn't bunch them all together.    Hope this helps.|`|fbhL6Gdhaa	Yes its really good, but maybe you could describe her eyes further, they are always a large point in character description :)  P.S Robert patterson is fit :)|`|nvI1GKWWaa	It is standard, common. Not good, not bad. It would help if you use more adjectives to spice it up. It doesnt need to be neat, just follow your own style of writing and make it creative.|`|S2ByqJSmaa	"Eden the Goddess of nature is naturally stunning!" Too repetitive, at first I thought that this was a parody. The entire description is very repetitive.    If this is a description for you to remember what she looks like, that's fine. If this is going to be in your story, I suggest spreading her description out. For example:    Eden looked down at her hands and fiddled with the daisy-bud ring on her third finger.    Later in the story:  She fixed her hair, filling the plait with tiny lavender.

ceBTTCPwaa	"The Offshore Pirate" is a short story written by F. Scott Fitzgerald in 1920. It is one of eight short stories originally published in Fitzgerald's first collection, Flappers and Philosophers.    The story is about a spoiled young woman named Ardita Farnan, who is on a trip to Florida with her uncle. Their boat is eventually captured by "pirates," and she falls in love with their captain.    The Offshore Pirate" (29 May 1920) was Fitzgerald's third Saturday Evening Post appearance during the month and demonstrates his rapid development as a versatile fiction writer. It is the first story that develops Fitzgerald's recurrent plot idea of a heroine won by her lover's performance of an extraordinary deed.    The story had originally ended with the weak explanation that it was all Ardita's dream. Fitzgerald rewrote the conclusion to emphasize the storyness of the story: "The last line takes Lorimer [the editor of the Post] at his word. It is one of the best lines I've ever written."    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Offshor...    http://en.papervitamins.com/fulltext/boo...    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappers_an...

When you're playing along with someone else, don't concentrate too hard on your playing.  Just keep your ears open to what the other person is doing, and try to make a contribution to make the whole song sound better.  The key is to keep listening.    This will automatically improve your playing, because you will pick up musical ideas from the other person / people, almost without trying.  It will also motivate you to improve your playing and learn new songs that you can share.|`|7VpDEkC6aa	Becoming a skilled guitarist doesn't happen overnight or even in 5 years.  I started at 8 yrs old. By 13 I was just starting electric guitar. Learning to play Santana songs with a music book along with the albums.  I could play the guitar solo melodies for Oye Como Va and songs like that. But I couldn't really play a guitar solo on my own until I started learning guitar scale for soloing.  http://www.all-guitar-chords.com/guitar_...    Try this site out and learn the "box patterns" for the Blues, Major, Minor  and penatatonic to start with.  I started with the Blues scale and immediately started to be able to improvise a guitar solo with the right notes.    Do not concern your self with speed. Speed is highly overrated anyway. Eric Clapton is considered to be tha best guitarist ever by a majority of people. He is not even close to fast. However he knows just about everything there is to know about the guitar.    knowledge is power.  Speed will happen with practice and knowledge.    I myself am not a "speedy " guitarist.  But after I had been playing for 10-12 years, we'd be recording our band practices and writing songs, and we'd play stuff back and I'd hear some of my licks and my jaw (and everyone else's) would drop, amazed at the lightning fast lick I had pulled off.    The more comfortable you are with your scales and where on the fretboard all the notes for that scale can be played really helps a lot.  once your fingers can go to those spots without your conscious thought, that's when you play what you are thinking musically, automatically. That's when speed starts to develop.    A lot of stuff you hear that "sounds " fast, really isn't.  Hammers and tapping and pull offs, stuff like that sound fast but aren't.    Stick with it, it'll happen    And do mention to your teacher that you'd like to explore more options.  If he is unwilling, get another teacher. Unless he thinks you can't handle it, you're his boss. You pay him. Tell him what you want.  the only lessons I took back then were the basic chords back when I was 9 or 10 and then two months of solo scales when I was like 14 or 15.  That's it.  The rest was done by practice and by ear and an old Mel Bay chordbook I had.    There is usually a "plateau" of speed eventually. But you haven't played long enough to hit it yet. I have hit my speed plateau. I'll never be able to play like the "metal" guys do. That's just way too fast for my body to perform.    Good Luck and Have Fun.|`|XOgvpDiZaa	Since you have a teacher, you should not be plateauing since a good teacher will always push you forward and find effective ways to get to where you (and he/she) wants you to go.    Now if you were completely self-taught that's a different story since you don't have direction.    I suggest you tell your teacher, because obviously he/she doesn't know about this, which is bad. But still tell your teacher and see what happens.|`|c14440593e2981ac6b4f5caac868376baa	I read that when you plateau in anything ( and this is normal) go back to the very beginning.

Very rarely do we really have the opportunity to see ourselves from different angles. That's probably why it seems so foreign to see yourself from different angles. Also, any photographer will tell you that lighting has a dramatic impact on the way a picture looks. For instance, take a flashlight and in a dark room point it straight up in front of your face starting from your chin. You get the idea. Don't worry, I have thought the same thing many times.

There has been many very well known historians who have proven most of what people know about Auschwitz was simply war propaganda created by Russia. Personally I visited Auschwitz and was surprised to not only see a arts and recreation building but also a swimming pool, both of which were created solely for use by the prisoners. Before perpetuating the myth about Auschwitz people should first separate fact from fiction. All over the Internet there are websites dedicated to proving what really happened at Auschwitz, I have only included a link to one for your reading pleasure. Like any war I am absolutely certain bad things happened during WW2 but it is nowhere near as bad as some people would want us to believe.|`|cTpBEj81aa	Good question!

When a title catches my eye I read the first couple of paragraphs and I know if that persons writing style appeals to me.     For instance I picked up a book the other day and read just a bit of the first page and I was hooked it was called 'The Visitor' by Lee Childs. It was a murder mystery type thing which I normally wouldn't read but because I judged by the writing style I read a book which I theory I wouldn't have other wise.    It's a case of trial and error. You have to like what you read. Other people's recommendations are all well and good but because we are all different one persons favorite author or book may not be yours.     Get to your local library and have a good ol' browse.    :-)

fbc5Lathaa	I can honestly say the best romance book you will ever find is the circle trilogy (Black, red, and white.) by ted dekker. it focuses on a PURE romance of God. Not only will she or even he in my brothers case (he is not gay) get that little butterfly when she reads them, but it will even completely change her relationship with God. I cant tell you how good those books for me were. They have really changed my life! plus they have a little action in them if she likes that. I would highly highly recommend you at least take a look.     Another good series is thorn in my heart by liz Curtiss higgs. I really really enjoyed those books, and they have the really hard core romance. they are pure romance books. But i don't recommend them if she is under 16.   Last one would be marcia Schuyler or Phoebee dean by Grace livingston hill. Those are perfect for any girl 13-17!   im 17 and loved everything (but especially the circle trilogy)  Hope thats enough information lol. hope you find something good!|`|6c30b5116a79d741042462d73fcdf99aaa	go to www.faithfulreader.com...great website for Christian readers!|`|Dq4VswJ6aa	I read the "Christy miller series"  i think its good, try it!

b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	I think if you use a poem that's written free-verse it would be best, so many people use rhyming patterns like A B A B C D C D, but that it makes poems sound like advertising jingles. Many poets don't even like Edgar Allan Poe's poetry because they think it sounds too repetitive and jingle-y, I myself really like Poe but the mood of a piece is more important than rhyming so keep that in mind. You might want to look at a picture of the ship or read some survivor accounts for good ideas. I myself like haiku, so here are some haiku to get you started.

Then I got to thinking- babies need someone to nourish them and take care of them. We all know that any baby would die without care.  So lets say humans were created as we are now, how did the first humans survive?  And where did those humans come from? Its really amazing, I mean we came from somewhere but nobody really knows where.  So those first humans somehow made it but who knows how.

People use quotes all the time, in projects, books, conversations, etc. You will only get in trouble if you say you wrote it yourself.

1ndsZlU6aa	I'll give you one move which i used in my GCSE choreography piece. It was a similar theme to yours i suppose...  If at some point in the piece you could have one person catch up with the one thats running away, put them into slow motion. The "runner" then falls to the ground landing on her back, arms and legs in the air (like a dead insect lol!) Then the "chaser" grabs her ankles, the runner grabs the chasers ankles (from her position on the ground), and they start to do roly-polys whilst holding onto eachothers ankles! (The first person to roll will need to be the chaser, falling head first downwards, going between the runners legs and then so on....)  It should flow as if they are a rolling tyre or something. Its easy if they try, its just having the confidence to do it cos its quite scary. But once theyve got it perfected its really impressive and effective.  I was gonna say its upto you what u have the other 2 "chasers" doing, but i could suggest that you then get them to chase the "rolling tyre" and decide your moves from there.  Have fun, if you get it to work, you could get an A like me :D lol|`|YQZui2R1aa	Glad you asked ! dance is my speciality....    try taking every day moves and developing them. for instance like a runner -  hop on one leg, your other behind you as if you've just been frozen whilst running.  then try bring the whole position into your Body, your arms legs and head. then you could slide out, jumping backwards role...   anything you like !    :)  i hope this helps..   it looks really effective by the way !:)

X7wvGFrZaa	My goodness, we do have different tastes and standards. If it were up to me to "finish" the song, well when I first started reading it, I thought the answer would be to put it through the shredder and finish it that way. But then I feel that way about a lot of music that sells and plays, for various reasons, most of them not flattering to the listeners, in my opinion, on the radio.    But here's the odd part, I did read all the way through, which surprised me because I usually just move on after the first few lines of something like this. Which makes me wonder if perhaps the song is so bad it's good, if you know what I mean. It certainly kept me reading to see what kind of no-brainer (like "i cannot escape what i dont run from" (sic)) and forced rhyme (like "she's something to admire/ dont you dare try to put out her fire" (sic)) would come next. The suspense was there, I have to admit, and pulled me along to the end. And rereading it brought new pleasure of the unkind, snooty sort. For example I wondered why you misspell "don't" and use lower case for "I" instead of using standard spelling. If it is part of an overall effort to write down to an intended audience, it seems wasted since radio listeners seldom read lyrics.    But hey, think of all the money you might make, and then with that happy thought in mind, try to be nice to Sissy, she's not all bad. Look not just at her answers, which may be a bit blunt, look also at one or more of the poems she's posted here.     Good luck, and thanks for the fun.|`|ZcJgYpE6aa	ummmmmmmmmmmmmm.....a new Nick Drake you're not..........  And you can't even write a song on your own........

At first, Sidney was repulsed by the gaggle of girls that hung on his every word, that is, until he explained that he has no control over the attraction others have for him, its just one thing out of many that he is just as confused about as she is.

As their relationship unfolds, the issue of sex comes up early on, more as an emotional and health issue than as a moral one. Both of them are aware that physical intimacy is both common and complicated. Michael has been sexually active, Katherine hasn't. Their relationship progresses slowly; they are accompanied on various meetings by her friend, Erica, a realist, who has known Katherine since 9th grade and believes that sex is a physical act and not a romantic act. They are also joined by Michael's friend, Artie, who, with Erica's help, explores and acknowledges some uncertainty about his own sexuality.    When they do, by mutual consent, have sex on Michael's sister's bedroom floor, they are sure it seals a love that will be "forever." However, separated for the summer by work that takes them to two different states, Katherine finds herself aware of the limitations of the relationship and ultimately attracted to a tennis instructor, Theo, who is older and more experienced in life. She takes responsibility for breaking the news to Michael when he comes on a surprise visit, the summer she knew was over , and Kath recognizes the loss as a stage in movement towards more complex, probably more satisfying relationships in the future."

b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	I've been the same way my whole life, suicide is never the answer. I sense an overwhelming depression in your words, depression is caused in large part by isolation, whether it's physical or mental isolation, trust me I know from 24 years of experience. No one truly wants to kill themselves, everyone wants someone to understand them and the only way that is going to happen is by expressing yourself. Communicate more, especially with your parents, as life goes on more and more people become distant from their parents in individualistic societies like the USA and most of Europe. People in Asian cultures know this better than anyone because they are primarily collectivist cultures, this means that the family is a unit and a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.    Maybe you should try talking to your family and friends, tell them that you love them, but you're depressed all of the time. A lot of times parents really care about their children so much that they can't see that they're depressed, they just see the child that they raised and love. My friend committed suicide a few years ago and I never told him how much I cared for him, I have to live with that pain everyday now, his pain was transferred to me and the people that loved him. I want to believe that he saw his death as the only way out, an escape, as if the world would be better without him, but it isn't in anyway. Every man, and woman, no matter what their age and situation, is a worthwhile creature that was given life so that they can protect what they care for as long as they can.    Every man's death affects me more than you can ever know, I know you hurt, but I'm making the decision for you. I need you to understand that suicide isn't an option, it isn't an escape from pain; I loved my friend more than he could have known, and he made such a positive impact on my life that I forgive him, but his memory is all that I have now. I know that he didn't realize that one man can change the world, and neither do you, but he did, and you can.    Everything happens for a reason, when we accept that this is true then we can find the reason. Study hard, I can tell you're a smart person and you have great potential. I know it hurts to be a smart person in a society that is becoming more full of idiots every day, look at the other answers to your question for god's sake, do they think their responses were witty or something? Intelligence, like any gift, sometimes seems like a burden but only if you treat it as such. If you properly use your gift to help others then you can find enjoyable things to do and interesting people to meet which will enrich your life.    I started keeping a journal, and then a weblog a few years ago, this helps a tremendous amount because all of our thoughts have a tendency to be disorganized after awhile and we can only remember the things that made us feel how we feel currently, but we are much more than this. We have a lot to be thankful for, we need to remember this or we'll be taking our friends and family for granted. When you wake up tomorrow I want you to breathe in and thank the countless men and women that gave their lives for this country, this world and our lives.|`|NlvTdPvRaa	Your poem made my heart sink.

Our existence is merely a very short one that is passing away when we are able to look at the universe as a whole in a scale that is mind boggling.    The cause of it is naturally too small for us to see and experimentally control easily.  If we should acquire the ability to manipulate life in that scale, we would be able to get at the fabric of existence.  That is a scary thought knowing our wary history amount the bickering heads of states.    Hopefully if we actually see what is coming at us in the universal scale, we are able to fix the little predicament we face on a daily basis and gain a foot hold on the nature of existence before getting whipped out by the a rock, or GRB or some other natural disasters on this grimy little blue planet like the dinosaurs.|`|jEZbYZwMaa	Ah what a concept. What one thinks of life sometimes depends on their religion. For me- catholic christian, I believe in god. I believe that we were put on this Earth to experience life and build personality, and to help people, and to enjoy ourselves, and to be happy, and to understand as much as we can. I believe that when our time comes we will be with god in a closer way for where ever we go. But at the same time, I'm 13. I still change my mind all the time. As for where life 'came from' well I don't really have any theories for that. I honestly don't really care. All I know is that I'm here and that I might as well follow what I believe and do things I love. I think it's so interesting that so many traditions have been made and so many things have formed along with human nature over the centuries. I love to think about these kind of things :) It's a little scary sometimes.. but so fascinating.|`|c96920c293cdf36eb8d8e0f57b935e41aa	I look at life like a game. No, not like god of war or traditional games, but I think that one needs to pass this level of life on Earth to get to the next level.The purpose I believe is to grow and evolve our soul. I believe that if someone commits suicide they automatically come right back here with the same issues as before. The point in my opinion is to grow and learn even know obstacles are put in our way. The end result of course would be Heaven.|`|872f4d28837b0b839ed695238bef2e97aa	Life is a fight against time.  Life exists because time exists.  Time tries to decompose things.  Life is the effort to keep the composition going.  When things die, they decompose.|`|ILTkc9Ddaa	Lately I have put much thoughts about "Life". Because when people ask "What's the meaning of Life?", to answer it, firstly we need to be certain what 'Life' is.     From my philosophical view:  Life is considered of two things, Living thing and Non-Living thing. As people know that human cannot live in Space, therefore Non-Living things (such as rocks, minerals, water, and etc) are part of Life, in other word it is the so-called 'perfect condition' for Living thing. Without Non-Living things, there will be no Life.    Learning more from nature, we always come across with counterparts or balances such that Action-Reaction, Positive-Negative, Particle-antiparticle, and North-South Magnetism. Furthermore, as a human, even in our genes we feel so Right about balancing life; for example when someone hurt you then for sure you want to hurt him back (unless there are conditions that make you think of other choices).    So I draw a conclusion that LIFE is BALANCE; when you don't have balance in your life then you will be out of the equation, therefore you will be gone forever. You might also know that IT Will Be No Good when Anything is Too Much.   Example in Human society: "You want to get salary (or reward in any form) for your job, don't you?"    But when we think for example in Religion: "Buddhist Reincarnation: What you give is what you get". Then what happen when there is no give and also no get; i think the answer will be Nothingness, in other word No-Life or something that is Not-Life.    When Life is imbalance then No-Life or Not-Life will occur.  for Example in physics: "Annihilation occur when particle meet antiparticle"  Example in general: "Magnet cannot exist without the North-South polarity"    But once you enter the imbalance equation, like the easiest example when someone is having imbalance diet, then he/she is closer to death, in other words, you will not be existing anymore.    Further Mind-blogging: Since Life itself need to follow the Balance Rule, then Life needs its counterpart which is Not-Life (whatever that means).  Imagine Life(L) is on one side of the equation and Not-Life(NL) on the other side. Therefore the equation is "L = NL". We are right now on the Life side, when we die what do you think is on the other side Not-Life?    Note; My mind blogging is started revolving in scientific thoughts, but it seems my thoughts lead me to the definition of what Religion called as Heaven / Next World.|`|AA11564934	Life is a characteristic of organisms that exhibit certain biological processes such as chemical reactions or other events that results in a transformation.    wikipedia    there is no perfect definition, even scientists can't decide whether a virus is alive.    THere were not "perfect" conditions  science can't answer "why" only how.    life would very likely evolve again, unless the laws of physics made it impossible.  we are a freak accident./

CI5qOBcDaa	1. well what part are you at? when huck is first with Jim, he is viewed as just a slave just property. when they are on the raft, Huck lies and says that Jim is his father who has small pox, so that they wouldn't get caught. Every time that things go wrong, huck always finds himself coming back to Huck. Especially at the end when the King and Duke sell Jim to slavery, Huck lies and sats his Tom, just so he can get Jim back.    2.Colonel Sherburn message is about following the crowd. All the townspeople chase after him because one person yelled to and no one wanted to be the one standing back, the outcast....and you should know your own definition of courage. the strength to stand up for something you don't want to do, or to step away from the crowd when you know something is wrong.    3. The fued was started long ago and no one remembers why it began but they still fight to kill themselves. it tells huck and the audience not to make sure they don't just do something, that they only fight for a just reason. it is ironic because these men are killing people and then go to church where one of the tne commandments is thou shall not kill.    =] hope that helps|`|klPvo7iwaa	Read the book  and do your homework by yourself.

I08iONdaaa	I don't think it's very good (sorry) and here's why. I write a lot too so, trust me, I'm just trying to iv you some advice. :)    The ambiguity of the scene makes the story seem kind of bland. You need to develop the setting at least partially in the first couple of paragraphs. The plot is generic, but you can make up for that by giving your reader better insight into your characters. "Silent tears" are not particularly interesting imagery, and it just makes your characters seem generic as well. You're narrating in the first person, but your narrator has no voice; instead it's just omnipresent which is a very bad way to develop the female character. It just strikes me as cliche and boring.     So those are my thoughts, and don't say "well I do that later in the story". There isn't going to be a later in the story if nobody's interested in your characters. Good luck and happy writing!    oh and it's "SCENE" not "seen"|`|xsizQ5X1aa	It's not bad, it's not great. For ME it doesn't quite catch my interest.    On line 5 the word seen, should be spelt scene|`|7Bb53RIDaa	Well I just looked at your hook which is suposed to have your reader interested and " Hurry up Gwen" isn't that great of a start for an interesting novel.|`|zYZIw0Mqaa	It's ok, I suppose.    I'm not too sure what you meant by catchy, but i'm assuming you're wondering if it's interesting enough? It certainly seems a dark story, which I would read - if it were written better.    You seem to have made the mistake most writers do, you forget that the story in your mind is not what we see - you're compelled to continue your story, and you forget to describe much.    I have no idea where they are, what's happened, why they're panicked, or generally what your plot is.    I gathered that they've done something bad, and that your character is upset.    Just keep on going, you have something - it's a rough diamond.    And tears are silent anyway, you don't need to say that =)    Hope this helps :-)|`|gTu8lC75aa	i read all fo it and i want to readmore! please!!!!  i think that you could add more dialouge,   ;)|`|5iMja1Meaa	Thats awesome :)    I want to read the rest :D|`|Grb85RJuaa	I'm not going to read all of that and I don't think anyone else will either.|`|qH6ppEHLaa	I enjoyed it.

RSdcFIk7aa	While this event is most commonly called the internment of Japanese Americans, in fact there were several different types of camps involved. The best known facilities were the Assembly Centers run by the Wartime Civil Control Administration (WCCA), and the Relocation Centers run by the War Relocation Authority (WRA), which are generally (but unofficially) referred to as "internment camps." The Department of Justice (DOJ) operated camps officially called Internment Camps, which were used to detain those suspected of actual crimes or "enemy sympathies." German American internment and Italian American internment camps also existed, sometimes sharing facilities with the Japanese Americans. The WCCA and WRA facilities were the largest and the most public. The WCCA Assembly Centers were temporary facilities that were first set up in horse racing tracks, fairgrounds and other large public meeting places to assemble and organize internees before they were transported to WRA Relocation Centers by truck, bus or train. The WRA Relocation Centers were camps that housed persons removed from the exclusion zone after March 1942, or until they were able to relocate elsewhere in America outside the exclusion zone.|`|AA11616338	Prisons & guards...

Check the schools and community groups as well as professional. Contact them and ask to be notified of any auditions.   If you do not get a part, offer to help in any way (paint scenery, usher etc.) Just being around the production you will learn a lot.  Study Dance, Music and Acting. You must be able to do at least one great and the others well enough to let the others work around you. Find classes or instructors that have produced talent.  Work on your image. You have to be a go getter, with lots of confidence and at the same time come across as humble.   Develop work ethics. Never be late. Never be absent. Always be attentive. Always show respect for others, even when you do not think they deserve it.  If and when approached by a talent agent or agency. Check them out carefully. If you are too young to sign a contract, remember your parents will need to be very involved.    Agents  They do not look at your picture and resume and go out and try to find you a job.  You should give them enough information about your skills and decent photos of you.  Almost all agents know where to find out about casting for theater and movies.   When these castings are announced they look through their files to see who might have a chance. If you appear to have a chance they will notify you.

You don't just get the name of agents and then contact them.  That isn't how it works.  You seem to be worried about getting famous and if you will have to move to another country.  Don't worry,  The chances of you getting famous are extremely unlikely to nearly impossible.  You are a minor and will need parental approval for anything you do.  Here is a much more realistic approach.  Try out for some school plays and local community theater.  See where you're at after you graduate from high school.  In the meantime, take school seriously because the chances of you becoming a world famous actress are as I said, very, very slim to almost nil.|`|XkMRjkFMaa	go to school for a theatre or acting degree of sorts, nothing beats a good, well trained performer.|`|ve1eCOKgaa	I've been in all my school productions since I was 5 and been all the main characters I've been to a camp for acting called Blue Lake and it is one of the most famous camps for acting (One line is not going to help you.).

Never go out without an education, without that your nothing, and when you go out and ask to be an a movie there going to ask about EDUCATION. They won't take you, if you don't have one(maybe they will but high chances are no).  I do want to be an actor, but only when I'm finished with my studies.  ----  Here's some tips:      Memorization skills:  The longest play I've ever been in was in a high school play when I was 12 years old. I was Wendy, in the Peter Pan:)  it was at least a 1 1/2 our play. But you had to memorize 38.  ---  Voice Variety:  You have to use that, suppose your in the play "The Green Monsters" and your one of the green monsters, you have to have to make a voice that will fit that part. Such as a loud, deep, scary, squeaky, any monster type voice.  ---  Body Language & Pantomime:  You have to show expressions using body and face language.  EXAMPLE: You are in a show, and something bad happens, you use your face expression to show it. If you have a part where you get in a fight, use your body language, react if it was a real fight.  ---  (Also, don't use bad language, and if you really did skip two grades you'd have better grammar. Just saying).       If you really badly want to become an actor here is a website, but don't use it until your ready.     www.exploretalent.com    --Maria C.|`|vLF2uz9saa	hahahahahah is u only won't fame then get to the back of the line do it cuz u want too!!!!

I don't exactly know where.|`|j7D3Sazraa	It's in a fictional book. The one the used for the movie was a stage prop.|`|gq5sfgE5aa	They were filming in Oregon so you could check the houses in the area. And I think they were filming in one other place but only for the shopping but if you checked some websites you could probably find where else they were filming but I'd try the houses in Oregon first. Good Luck|`|QWsnxVlYaa	Its probally just display...  and if it wasnt it would probally be taken by now  sorry|`|3WCXGRaGaa	uhm.. its probably in Forks...  but hey, just go live in the montines or something or near them. your'll get alot of beaty. the Cullens house if it was being sold.. it woudl have been alreayd boughten|`|YhjTbSmDaa	Edward Cullen is a fictional character, the house wasnt really his.     But the house was probably in Portland, Oregon.  (Thats where the film was primarily filmed.)|`|0JERmAslaa	the movie was shot in Forks, Washington so try and check there|`|FYT97XLgaa	its in the book|`|i4SVk2Cpaa	probably near portland.  but you can find houses like that outside of seattle and in idaho area
hQ95u9OLaa	Firestarter is a great old one. It grabs you from the first word.  The Dead Zone is also very good.  And you know kind of a forgotten one is Christine.  But his book of short stories Night Shift actually (I'm not kidding, made me nervous about being up late by myself. Graveyard Shift is truly terrifying, so is The Mangler and so is Sometimes They Come Back.|`|wYF6U6qlaa	cujo|`|YbmklSzGaa	Dreamcatcher or Insomnia.|`|aFVzMM5laa	Cujo or 'Salem's Lot.  Both are really good.|`|fk8wXA3Saa	Desperation !|`|IsozKRNeaa	Salems Lot was amazing. Or Dolores Claiborne. They were equally amazing.|`|bZ99fJVdaa	Pretty much all of his books are good.  A couple of my favorites are "Needful Things" and "Desperation".  He also wrote "The Regulators" under his pen name of Richard Bachman as sort of a companion to "Desperation".|`|ee70635f83473518cde2e7cf3b8004d4aa	You have to read "The Stand".  It's definitely his best.  Also, Salem's Lot, Christine, Cujo and all the Richard Bachman stories especially Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,The Long Walk, Thinner (one of my favourites) and The Running Man.|`|5iQ4FE1Uaa	Desperation is my favorite King. The Stand is also very good.|`|Zq8cU1Kdaa	You should definitely continue and maybe read "Salem's Lot". Afterwards, and I can only highly recommend it, read "The Dark Tower" - all 7!!!    It is actually a lot of fun if you know some characters of King's books and then you can still discover links to the Tower when you read other books afterwards.    If you do not want to consider the DARK TOWER; read "Stark - The Dark Half" or Duddits.    And The Talisman + The Black House (with Peter Straub) are fabulous too - King = THE King    ...And if you're up to some realistic stuff and like "The Lord of the Flies", read Stephen King's "The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon"!!!|`|pqdSSiTMaa	Firestarter was good.    The Eyes of the Dragon was awesome and a quick read.    Skeleton Crew is good for a break from novels.  The stories tend to also be darker than the novels.    A warning about Desperation and The Stand: King gets into religion and I always find his ruminations on religion outsatifiying.|`|UDoW2tT7aa	I'm currently reading The Dark Tower series. But Desperation, Dreamcatcher, The Stand and Everything's Eventual; 14 Dark Tales are all really, really great books.|`|V7qtxFccaa	Don't count out his short story collections.

QEexR4gjaa	industrial rev: bad working conditions led to spread in disease: especially cholera(caused by contaminated water), workers were also overworked in factories. they longed for long hours. Facotry act of 1833 changed that. The act also prohibited children in certain ages from working in the factories....during industrial rev. many children worked in mines  imperialism: social darwinism: european nations were enforcing their tradition and ways of life on different cultures, they were destroying traditions and cultures of the indigenous people (europeans wanted to impose their religions on the natives). Europeans exploited the natives: they used them as slaves, also they stole their resources

When I was first playing I used to cheat the Gm chord by just playing the GBE strings only and barring the 3 strings at the 3rd fret.    you could try the same thing on the first fret for  Fm until you get a little stronger. It'll sound a little weak, but at least it will be an Fm.

5liN3A1laa	He was a Gladiator, possibly from Thrace and possibly a desserter of the Legions (or more likely the auxiliary).  He and several fellow gladiator/slaves revolted and fled to Mt. Vesuvius near Naples and were quickly joined by run away slaves, shepherds and the very poor of the country side.  This led to Rome's second so-called Servile War.  The forces he gathered (around 70000 at their height) put the whoop *** on several Legions.  Spartacus led the slave army north, probably with the idea of dispersing and going to their homelands when reaching Gaul.  However, many of the slave army wanted to continue to pillage and plunder Italy.  Heading back south he attempted to cross to Sicily but was denied.  Eventually a future Triumvir, Crassus, led an Army that was able to defeat Spartacus.  Crassus had some 6000 slaves crucified along the road to Rome.  Another future Triumvir, Pompey, came in for the clean up operations and tried to claim the victory himself.    Spartacus has been seen in popular culture as a resistor to oppression, the heroic underdog who battles and unjust and more powerful foe, and adopted by communists as a symbol of class struggle.    I don't assign him such heroic virtues as this, but he did have SOME leadership ability.|`|b3456135bf4f0f591eca2857f5c90758aa	Spartacus born in Thrace , Sold into slavery about 73BC history says that he was most likely a paid auxiliary who didn't obey orders and was punished by being sold that was a usual practise in them days , was entered in to a school of gladiators owned by a Roman named Lubus , Spartacus with a another slave organised a revolt and escaped to Mount Vesuvius that was nearby, he than moved onto southan Rome gathering slaves as he went , amounting to about 70.000 won many battles with Roman legions but was eventualy boxed in by the Roman Praetor Crasseus with ten legions , Forced to fight in open land the Gladiator was no match for such a large force of well trained soldiers and Spartacus was most likely killed in battle his body was never found.Spartacus became a symbol of freedom and that great Rome was not as invincible as it was made out to be .|`|hQ95u9OLaa	As a great hero who stood up to the might of the military/political world. I think Kubrick's ending is highly romanticized. I have read somewhere (I can't remember) that he likely threw himself into the heaviest of the fighting so he wouldn't be caught and suffer those humiliations and tortures. Seems like a very human thing to do.|`|nER0xNaWaa	he was a roman gladiator who leaded an uprising against the roman republic
cxDbdhELaa	The problem is that the use of the word "wrong" is too extreme.    A better way to put it would be:  WAR IS KILLING, AND KILLING IS UNDESIRABLE, SO WAR MUST BE UNDESIRABLE.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Make sense to me.|`|sRw9oiQdaa	I agree in principle.  I could only ever 'kill' someone to protect my children...  some wars are built on that idea, but many are about money and power.|`|jiMAtaCraa	The statement is fundamentally flawed. War does not immediately mean "killing". You can have a "cyber-war" for example (a war that involves the destruction of technological entities - e.g. stock markets, aerospace industries etc).     It is only slightly correct if we ignore the preconception with "killing" - that being murder. If we assume that killing simply means anything done to put "an end" to something, then the question asked would negate on what is generally considered as "war" - it would assume that if I "put an end" to the life of an insect, as "war".|`|fLHV3pmuaa	I agree, and I'll give you another one:    "Why do we kill people who kill people to show that killing people is wrong?"|`|47c479f2304b0788f9cb6367693718d5aa	Killing is wrong?  I believe most would say that murder is wrong.  Killing people is not a good idea but a uniform "killing is wrong" will automatically render your premise as false since we kill to eat.  So lets assume you mean that murder is wrong.  Define murder.  Is it killing some one who is trying to kill you?  If not then perhaps defending yourself is not all that wrong.  So what kind of war are you talking about? a war of aggression or a defensive war.  Then there is the aggressive war that assumes that the best defense is a good offense.    Then there is the decision to maintain your life style and or prosperity against some one who doesnt want you to have it.  Some one wants to rob your country (France and Viet Nams rubber crop) what do you do? surrender your prosperity and liberties to them?  Or do you think that we should all just "get along"?  Peace would be nice as long as it doesn't mean total surrender.  Some one once asked me what there was in life that was worth killing for.  My answer as a former soldier was "nothing!  The problem is that there is so much worth dying for, like your liberty or your family."  Just a little different perspective for you.  Have a peaceful day.|`|AA11635601	It's an oversimplification.  It depends on why you make war, whether you are the initiator or the defender, whether you are acting as an ally per a treaty, etc.    In nature, including humans, creatures will use violence to stave off their own death.  We defer to the group as a whole usually, but even individually - some guy tries to rape you?  You're allowed to blow him away.  And most people would.  So is that wrong?  I think it depends on circumstances.|`|eGh9HLXcaa	Well is the death penalty wrong? Not to some countries, but to some others, it's wrong. So to those countries which are fine with the death penalty, killing to them in this case is not wrong.     And the situation which you've mentioned, it has left out an important point. What if the war is a necessity. What if a country has to defend itself against another which has taken the first step to starting the war for an invasion? In this case, NOT going into the war would be wrong, since the country's people must be protected and defended.     So this opinion, although at first reading it seems fine, on a closer inspection, it is flawed and incorrect.|`|jIccV2sOaa	Let me put it to you that, since wars are not created by the people of a country,  but are caused by their country's  leaders ( for there own gratification and/or profit or for the gratification and/or profit of their friends) then the leaders are wrong.   So your question does need some modification. These ego ridden imbecilic fools who have caused the deaths of trillions of people have even become so insulated from the reality of what they are doing that they even have a "code of conduct" they call the GENEVA CONVENTION....sanctioning good "healthy" ways of killing the people who are controlled by those they wish to defeat!!!! Unbelievable!!!  Get rid of them NOW.|`|jOTTIDNQaa	I don't necessarily agree with this statement because it doesn't follow logically, like some others have said war doesn't always mean murder and murder doesn't always mean war. But the actually concept of war: essentially fighting for land, I disagree with. Especially the modern concept of war where more civilians are killed then soldiers, that doesn't make sense. If you want to volunteer your life for your country then that's your own choice but to kill innocent civilians who mostly have no choice in their government or thier actions, that is wrong. Surely with all the technology and methods of communication that is available to us now there must be another way to sort out our differences without killing others. Even if we just lock a group of politicians up in a room until they come to an agreement!!|`|8ZcGDTzOaa	war can be wrong without killing.  why don't you phrase it this way:  boxing is violent, and violence is wrong, so boxing must be wrong.  or  bullfighting is violent, and violence is wrong, so bullfighting is wrong.    Right and Wrong is not based on logic but on culture.  If your culture says something is right, then logic doesn't matter at all.|`|T4CZbRsSaa	don't believe in right or wrong... its a lie they tell us to control us... shhh listen you can hear the carrot cry as it suffocates once weve pulled it from the ground|`|2e2f438d78517ad777fa3313fb112873aa	Your first statement doesn't make sense, because war can have something to do with killing but to say that it IS killing is nonsensical. War is a relationship between various groups of people that try and conquer one another. Killing is usually the means of doing this. Not all wars have had killing involved, though; for instance, the "cold war". Russia and America were said to be "at war" with one another even though no deaths occurred. If we were to make more sense out of the first statement and create an argument with it, then it would look like this:    War can involve killing  Killing is wrong  Therefore, war is wrong    First, your argument is already invalid because it commits the "four term fallacy". Secondly, at best we could only show that sometimes something involved in war was wrong. This would be like saying that because sometimes fighting is involved in professional sports, and since fighting is wrong, that professionals sports are wrong. What we want to know is whether war itself is actually bad, not some aspects of it. Nobody would rationally disagree with some aspects of war being bad. Lastly, others have already pointed out that killing is not always wrong even if were to say that "killing people" instead of just "killing is wrong". One needs only to show that protecting our self will sometimes require us to kill a criminal or insane person trying to harm us or our family.     I cannot agree with this argument since it doesn't show that the conclusion is true.|`|AA10287176	I don't agree with the second premise. Surely there are some cases where killing is not wrong (like self-defense, to protect innocents, etc.)    So if killing is not always wrong, then it does not follow that war must be wrong.|`|HPuiI7BCaa	The 2nd premise, "Killing is wrong" seems flawed to me.     Is killing in self defense wrong? Do you think we must allow ourselves to die rather than kill? If our country is attacked then is it wrong to defend it?     Is killing to save our children wrong?|`|GpPclegDaa	It is valid, but unsound. The second premise, that killing is wrong, is completely off-base.    Killing is a very effective way of removing a person or thing, and is often much more feasible than nonviolent conflict resolution. So that opinion is a misguided one.|`|vy0HQD9raa	Well, yes to a certain extent. But then again there is people who would argue that they go to war to protect their loved ones and country, yet some wars are over pathetic things such as oil and land, surely there is a simpler and less horrendous solution than war? In my opinion i think a lot of conflict could be avoided by sorting the problems out in a more civilized manner, but people wont listen and jump to the conclusion that war will sort it out. War is a last resort in my mind.|`|mY4m47WTaa	Logically flawed statement, begging the question.
3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	1) Pap - Huck's father.  He's the dead man that Huck and Jim find in a house floating down the river and Jim tells Huck not to look at his face.  Pap's influence is that Huck (thinking Pap is still alive) makes arrangements to have is money locked away where Pap can't get at it and drink it all away.  Getting away from Pap is also a major reason why Huck makes the trip with Jim in the first place.  When Huck learns that Pap is dead, he knows he's free to return to St. Petersburg and he can stop worrying about Pap.    2) Miss Watson - Jim's owner.  She freed Jim in her will, making Jim a free man when she died.  So Jim is also free to return to St. Petersburg without running the risk of being pursued as a runaway slave, and that means that Huck doesn't have to choose between his hometown and his friend.

DvToP5h7aa	Pride and Prejudice - Jane Austen    Character Sketch    George Wickham to Fitzwilliam Darcy    They have reverse characters. On the outside, Darcy is cold and alienating, while Wickham is charming and amiable. On the inside, Darcy is capable of great acts of kindness and love, while Wickham is an untrustworthy fortune-hunter. This is further supported by Elizabeths relations to the two. Wickham is initially her ideal of all that is amiable and good, and she viewed Darcy as no better than Darth Vader. After she learns their true natures, however, she reverses her opinion. It seems as though Wickham and Darcy are meant to play each others opposite.    http://www.shmoop.com/character-roles/li...    ============================    About Mr. Wickham:    http://www.shmoop.com/character/literatu...

v70p2kgWaa	Freshman English The teacher got done with the lecture early and decided to have a class room discussion on books.  We were suppose to raise our hands and not talk when others are talking (ya right).  Anyway, at that time my a friend was reading Left Behind and I was reading Left Behind: the Kids.  Somehow the two of us got into talking about the series.  My friend was in front of me and had turned around to talk.  Suddenly the teacher came up and slammed her hands on my friend's desk.  It scared my friend so bad that she ended up with a bloody nose.  That incident solidified our friendship and even though we are in college now, we still haven't let the teacher forget that she gave a student a bloody nose.

One day there was a spider around her classroom and the minute someone pointed it out she said "Kill It!"  I said "spider's are good for the eco system".

QgE85Qynaa	While the majority of problems were a result of WWII, there were some issues that arose from WWI, primarily in the issue of land use.    During WWI, the Ottomans (who still used a brutal Feudal system known as the "Ottoman Land Code") heavily taxed and conscripted the Arabs, especially in Palestine. Masses of Palestinians were forced to fight for the Turks during WWI, leaving a large number of women, children, and the elderly to tend to what little existed of Palestinian farms. When Israel was created, a common Zionist claim was that the Israelis were actually developing the land, as opposed to the "indolent" Arabs who had left it fallow (ignoring the fact that the Arabs had been brutally taxed by the Ottomans and had been denied the use of any form of modern equipment).    Additionally, the fact that the Ottomans fought in WWI (and lost) allowed the British and French an excuse to snatch up the Arab territories and rule them, later resulting the British using Arab land to create a Jewish state for the European Jews (much to the outrage of the Palestinians, both Christian, Muslim, and Semitic Jews).|`|5liN3A1laa	Adding to Jacques notes, during the War Britain sought support from the Jews and promised a Jewish Homeland in the Holy Land which was eventually "formalized" in the Balfour declaration.

Then sometimes late at night when I'm not next to you  I'm drifting & dreaming & hoping, darling, you are too.    I'd like to think, if you don't mind, that I belong to you even when you're far away.  When it feels like I can't see another lonely yearning and you're still far away  Then sometime I'll take a flight & end up next to you  Then, darling, I'll know that's when drifting, dreaming will come true.    I don't know why I feel so close to you even when you're far away.

Ow3O7h4caa	Hi    The secret of chord progressions lies in your imagination and to be able to substitute chords at the blink of an eye. If you know your cycle of 5ths, then progressions should come easy for you.    Start by substituting in half steps. A good trick is to harmonize using your bass line (6th string) or the small string. Two different approach.    Start on the G maj 3rd fret, and move up in 1/2 steps toward A, then Bb, B etc....  Ex... G maj7, G dim, Amin9, Bbdim, Bmin9 and go backwards but substitute the chords.  B min 9, Bb13, Amin7, Ab13, G maj 7     Or use the small string and build chords in the same fashion. You are basically using the small strink and you harmonize on it. Actually, you are using it as a leading tone.    Hope this helps.      http://www.all-guitar-chords.com/circle-...    http://www.petethomas.co.uk/jazz-chord-p...|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TebUMhJAK...

Dan Brown is a good author. If you've read Da Vinci code, you'd like his other stuff: Angels& Demons; Digital Fortress and another one (forgot the name)    "The Kite Runner" was very well written - the same author also writes "A Thousand Splendid Suns" may be similar to Noughts in that it they deal with societal and relationship issues    "The Historian" was good; a long read, but extremely interesting at points. It deals with the mysteries surrounding Vlad Tepes and his burial and a modern family connected to him; and a quest to find out whether or not myths of him becoming dracul are true.

NYU37jfGaa	Elizabethan peasant farmers were at least partly self-sufficient.  They would grow their own crops, graze their animals on the common land, and produce much of their own food.  The peasant's wife would generally be in charge of the poultry and the dairy, she would raise the chickens, collect the eggs, milk the cows and make her own butter and cheese.  She would brew the ale that most people drank instead of water. They would sell their surplus produce at market.  They might have some craft or trade that would supplement their income.  A lot of women spun wool or flax into thread to sell to professional weavers for example, as well as for home use.    Nowadays, few people are self-sufficent, most people work for wages, and hardly anybody produces their own food and clothing etc.    But most modern working class people probably enjoy a better standard of living than the Elizabethan peasant.  Most people nowadays have indoor plumbing for example, which in Elizabethan times was a luxury only found in wealthy households.  Electric lighting must be considered an improvement over having to make your own candles out of mutton fat or (if you could afford it) beeswax.  And, let's face it, who wouldn't rather have central heating than have to make up a smoky fire,not to mention having to chop the wood to fuel it?  and you would have to be in a state of truly desperate poverty, in the modern western world, to be short of food, whereas in th elife of the Elizabethan peasant the fear of famine was a real and present danger.    Working class houses nowadays are mostly warm and comfortable, with glass windows (glass was an expensive luxury in Elizabethan times), and would seem incredibly luxurious to the average Elizabethan peasant.    On the other hand, an Elizabethan peasant might be scornful of a modern person's almost total helplessness.  An elizabethan peasant could turn his or her hand to almost anything.  An elizabethan peasant woman, used to producing her own foodstuffs and clothing, making her own candles and soap, even concoting her own home remedies for sickness, might be envious of all our bright modern conveniences, but she might also be just a little bit scornful of our total dependence on modern technology.
7VpDEkC6aa	If you are using the musical melody, then I think you'd be in trouble, especially if you ever get to the point where it is performed or recorded and sold or even put on Youtube.   (I heard from a guy that had auditioned for a play singing a Disney song and someone had videoed the AUDITION with their cell phone or something and put it on youtube. And he got a nasty letter from Disney.)    Have you heard of Weird Al Yankowitz?  He does song parodies. But he get permission from the artist to use the music. One time he did a gangsta rap parody "supposedly" without permission and the rapper got ALL ticked off.    Andrew Lloyd Webber has a pretty good sense of humor, I think. As long as it's just a snippet, I'd go ahead and send him a copy of the lyrics and tell him about the little snippet and ask him for permission to use it.  http://www.andrewlloydwebber.com/help/in...

731762ff5b663deba6422ffbee7b6ebcaa	I am a (mostly) self-taught guitar player.  I have been playing for many years now.  I would say that guitar is one of the easiest and most satisfying instruments to learn, because you can learn a lot of popular folk, country and rock songs with just a few months practice at the begining to master the basic chords and changes.  (Mainly I'm talking about playing chords, to accompany yourself or a a friend singing.  Soloing on guitar is much more difficult.)    When you first pick up a guitar, it's difficult to do anything at all.  But  if you spend about three months practicing hard, you will be able to play a few basic chords and change from one to the other relatively quickly.  Then you've got it made; with this basic technique you can play a whole bunch of songs.    You don't need lessons, but it would be good if you have a friend who knows how to play at least show you the right way to hold the instrument, finger the chords, and demonstrate how it should sound.  Then you should be able to teach yourself with a chord chart, and a song book.  The best thing to start on are simple songs, like classic country, or folk, which often have three, or sometimes only 2 chords.    Yes, your fingers will hurt at the beginning, but it's no big deal.  I don't know how to treat your calluses; just try to keep playing and after a week or two they'll stop hurting.  Sore fingers are a badge of honor, like getting sore muscles when you work out at the gym.    Many beginners like to start on a nylon string classical guitar, because its easier to depress the strings and easier on the fingers, compared to a steel string accoustic guitar.  The disadvantage is that if the music you're into is normally played on an accoustic guitar you are going to have to make a switch at some point when you get more advanced, and you'll have to invest more money.     If you're interested in playing popular or traditional American music, I would encourage you to do some singing once you learn the basic chords.  Just playing guitar without singing can get a little boring, in my opinion.    Good luck!|`|EFTTmwx0aa	yo, first of you will love playin once you get in to it. yeah when you first start playin your fingers will hurt a tad but nothing major but if you  just build it up and play gradually more and more your fingers will get used to it and all of a sudden it dosnt hurt at all! unless you stop playin for a while. I never once got really really bad pain or messed up fingers that didnt go back to normal after a little bit. No lots of people are self taught and can progress just as well as people who have been taught ( i was taught). It also depends if you want to be able to play chords or finger pick or w.e u wanna be able to do. Its harder to develop finger picking and that on your own but chords is easy to self teach. either way alot of practice is mainly whats required. Good luck|`|ytvvQdKUaa	hey i started playing guitar about a year ago and im self taught.  i found it really easy to pick it up.  you will get callouses but its really no big deal just leave them alone.  i found it the easiest to play tabs.  i get all my songs from www.ultimate-guitar.com and then i just find the tabs.  playing is actually really fun but you need to stick with it to get better.|`|XOgvpDiZaa	There will be pain in the wrist and fingers of your fretting hand (left hand), because your hand isn't used to this. You will get calluses on your left hand fingers only, and that's where the pain in the fingers comes from. Pain is only when you first start but once you get past the basics you'll be fine (but perhaps when learning new chords/scales your left wrist will hurt). Again, it will go away.    I suggest not to play through the wrist pain, because you can seriously injure yourself and you can't play guitar perhaps temporarily or even permanently. When your wrist starts to hurt, stop. But when your fingers start to hurt try and play through the pain unless it's unbearable to do so.    There's no way to take care of calluses, but if you don't play for a while they will disappear.    Being a self taught guitarist isn't bad, because sometimes people don't have a choice. (Unless they have a friend or parent who can teach them). If not, then check out cyberfret.com for free guitar lessons.|`|0viBGF9vaa	Callouses are good, keep them because one you get them you wont feel any pain in your fingers.

Something all us guitarists can say we have gone through.  Once you have em, if they ever start to peel away you can put small band aids over them until they heal up again...teaching yourself is always the best alternate option if no one can teach you...I can't stress enough though how much better it is to have a teacher since they can walk you through and correct bad habits that you may develop...A good teacher can usually adjust to your learning curve and find the best way for you to learn the quickest...but other than that, there are many websites and books that can help!|`|aOjMf5SPaa	The tips of your left hand get sore, but stick it out and they'll go hard, you won't even notice after a week or two.

Z6oc1VgSaa	You've got a good sense of composition it looks like. but i don't quite feel some of your cropping choices (i.e. the picnic table one--cut a little close there at the bottom and with too much room on the sides)     I like your trees against the sky pictures--that's one of my favorite subjects, too. but be careful with your lighting. it's a little blown out on a couple. and also watch your composition. some of them are a little boring. try to find interesting lines and forms that you don't see every day. which i think you have in a couple of them. play around with composition. take 5 or 6 pictures of the same scene all from different angles, then choose the most interesting one.    I love the coin pictures, macro is fun. the details in the scratches on the table in the one of the nickel are amazing. you really should find some insects to photograph.     The one called "what's cooking?" is really nice, i love the lighting and the dark mood--it's almost scary, like what IS cooking? body parts?haha...BUT it is a little tooooo dark. A lot of details are lost in that heavy black. I love a nice dark mysterious photo, but it's better to have a well-rounded dark print with rich blacks that you can still pick out the details in. be careful of that. same with the one called "stairs....." a really nice photo, creates a very distinct mood, but it is too dark there in the bottom left corner. i'd love to see a little more detail in those vines and leaves. But the shadows created by the railing are really lovely! and you really do have the potential to create great photos with a distinct style of mysterious/dark/scary moods. try making a series of photos that go together in a story! it's so much fun, and i'm sure you could use a theme and roll with it easily.    one of your photos which i thought was particularly excellent was the first brooklyn bridge one. it has wonderful tones and a striking composition. i like the speedboat in the foreground, though i almost wish you had waited a split second longer so it was a little further to the left. but still, good one.    I also like your perspective shots of buildings and such. Your best work seems to be black & white moody shots of either a specific object or buildings with lots of lines and perspective. keep going with it, like i said try to develop a group of work with a story/common theme. maybe start with the "what's cooking?" picture and make 10 or 15 pictures that go together. that's a good way to develop your talent. and pay attention to darkness/brightness. I know you like dark, but you can get dark while still keeping detail.     I suggest taking a darkroom class, it's a really great way to gain a deeper understanding of photography and how it works, and also how to make a good photo with good contrast and tones. It looks like you have some talent, so develop it! no pun intended ;) good luck & have fun!|`|0e4fea790f4ea59363811798798d53a0aa	pretty good in my opinion.

It is almost two hundred years since Samuel Romilly introduced reforms in 1808 to abolish the death penalty for some of the 200-plus capital offences under England's "Bloody Code". Capital offences in this "Bloody Code" included:     being in the company of gypsies for one month;   vagrancy for soldiers and sailors;   "strong evidence of malice" in children aged 7-14 years of age.     A Commons vote in 1938 called for legislation to abolish hanging in peacetime for a five-year experiment - but the onset of World War Two meant no more happened. Two later attempts were blocked by the House of Lords and then side-stepped by Labour and Conservative governments. The Labour government created a Royal Commission on the death penalty in 1948. The Conservative government came up with compromise legislation in 1957.     Due to several controversial cases in t
d89ugMAcaa	Just write about something you are interested in, there is no point writing a book that you aren't interested in because you will loose interest in it and not be able to finish it as it takes more than a day to write a novel, it could take years.    Do not think about writing a novel because of the money you could make as very very very few authors make enough to be able to write full-time and give up the day job.    Write something original, don't just try to write something like harry potter or twilight just because they sold well as no publisher will take on something which they already have. They want original work.    btw that is not the only 'marketable' style of work, there are loads of publishers out there that each specialise in their genres. So you could write for any genre you like, Romance and Fantasy are popular atm, but if you are a good writer then you will get published no matter which genre you write in    So brainstorm some possible ideas which interest you and are original. Then start writing your novel. Once you have finished, leave it a week or so then read through it and changes bits here and there (edit it basically). Then hire a Professional Editor to edit it again for you. Then write a query letter, synopsis (Google for help) and send them + two/three sample chapters off to a Literary Agent (Buy Writer's Market 2009 for lists of Agents). Then if they choose to work with you then they will send the work off to publishers after you have edited the novel together.|`|Pn5Ar0ufaa	Try the Snowflake Method.

v70p2kgWaa	no    A readers response is simply what a casual reader thinks about the book.  It's kind of like feedback.  Mostly it is concerned about plots, characters, and how the reader reacts and feels about these things    A literary analysis looks at the elements that make up the story.  It looks at how the plot forms, what makes up the character, the writing style used.    Here's a short example  Reader's Response  Ethan Frome sucked, seriously.  I would have chucked it out of my class room window if I thought it would do any good.  The story was hard to follow and the ending was stupid.  (okay doesn't have to be to this extreme but you get the point, a reader response is looking at feelings and impressions)    Literary Anylsis  Ethan Frome is an extraordary work of literature.  Wharton's rich use of color symbolism gives the story meaning and depth.  The use of flashbacks added to the story creating a since of foreboding.  Through Ethan's tragedy, Wharton is able to convey a message of how societies rigid expectations can cause more damage than good.  (literary analysis is a usually a little more structured, it looks at pieces of the story and how the work together.  Both these opinions are what I truly feel about the book, do you see a difference?)|`|kUE3Ddktaa	This is tricky, because sometimes a reader response is literary analysis, and sometimes it isn't.    A reader's response, as someone said, is just your reaction to the story. "I liked it" or "I thought it was boring." That's a response, but it's not a literary analysis.    BUT    There is a school of literary criticism called Reader-response Criticism. It began in the 1960s, and the philosophy behind it is that the author's intention, the historical background - all the context and details of the book - are not as important as the individual reader's experience with the book. Reader-response critics believe that the work's real meaning is whatever the reader interprets - and of course, that's different for every reader. It can even be different for the SAME reader - you have a different interpretation when you read the book at 50 than you did when you read the book at 25.    The difference is that reader-response criticism isn't an opinion of how much you liked or didn't like the book. You have to analyze why you feel a certain way about different characters, or why, in your opinion, the setting is significant. You have to think about how the experiences of your life guide your understanding of the text.    Here is a great page on reader-response criticism that may be helpful to you: http://bcs.bedfordstmartins.com/Virtuali...    So, depending on what your instructor has asked you to do, your reader response might be literary analysis, or it might just be a reaction.|`|LykjWv6faa	Yes.|`|6YyeqVMQaa	i wouldn't think so...i'm not sure what a reader response is, but i know literary analysis is when u like, pick apart quotes from the book in the essay. i've had to write several for class.|`|OqviBejiaa	No, not at all.     A reader response is a personal reaction. The reader is discussing their feelings and thoughts about the material. It is very subjective because it is opinion.     A literary analysis on the other hand is objective. The person writing the literary analysis is looking at the literary merits of the work and dissecting them to look for deeper meaning. This type would deal more in the realm of imagery, metaphors, symbols, motifs, etc.|`|SAabFxB2aa	A readers response would be a reaction to a writing and would be THE analysis that I would pay attention to if I were the writer.  A literary analysis would be more of a professional criticism of the piece in question detailing all aspects of content, style, ect.|`|var2c8zVaa	reader response is what the reader thought of the story  literary analysis is like someone analising the story|`|5478d54ea53fcef0ef93502a7e237c89aa	No.  A reader response could be as simple as "I didn't like it".  That is no analysis at all.  A literary analysis is serious scholarly discussion of themes, devices, plot elements, characterization, allusions, symbolism, influences of other authors, and so on.  A reader response is subjective; a literary analysis is objective.

The movement may be seen as a revolution, since it led to the ousting of the queen regent, Mary of Guise, who governed the country in the name of her young daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots. Knox helped write the new confession of faith and the ecclesiastical order for the newly created reformed church, the Kirk. He continued to serve as the religious leader of the Protestants throughout Mary's reign. In several interviews with the queen, Knox admonished her for supporting Catholic practices. Eventually, when she was imprisoned and James VI enthroned in her stead, he openly ridiculed her in sermons. He continued to preach until his final days.

xnVTRGmyaa	What style of harp are you interested in? Most people think of the large pedal harps they see in orchestras, but there are many other styles. The low end of pedal harps will cost around $15,000. They have 46 or 47 strings, and weigh around 90 pounds.  Lever harps don't have the same range and chromatic capability of pedal harps, but are much more affordable and low-tech. They are much smaller; the largest lever harps might have 38 strings. Mine has 32, and for the Irish music I play, that's plenty. Lever harps come in all sizes, from 19-string lap harps on up, depending on the maker. If you were to buy one exactly like mine (made by a company called Dusty Strings, which I believe to be the best maker in the U.S.), it would cost about $3,800.  Do avoid the cheap $200-300 harps you might find--they are usually cheaply built Pakistani harps of poor quality. Remember, you get what you pay for. If you're seriously interested in playing harp, you should expect to invest some serious time and money into getting a quality instrument.  As far as lessons, that depends on the teacher you find, his or her experience level, and many other pricing factors depending on the individual teacher. You might do well to ask around at your local music store. I don't really have a set price for the lessons I've given; I'm self-taught, and so my technique and music theory base aren't as perfect as someone who has had lessons. But I'm able to teach basics at least; I'd probably ask $25-30 for a half-hour lesson.|`|w13Zbnk7aa	I used to play harp...they cost A LOT! especially for a good one.     I know of a folk harp that costed 4,000$.  I am not sure how much a concert harp goes for...    It also depends on the size you want too.  Lessons would probably be the same for any instrument. Maybe 33$ for 45min?

I wish they'd fall of the world's edge. It was real.  I was (and still am) a big Shadows fan, so I remember their stuff, like Apache, Wonderful Land, Atlantis, and The Rise and Fall of Flingel Bunt. I got a kick out of listening to Jet Harris and Tony Meehan hits such as Diamonds and Scarlett O'Hara. And a big hit here and in the states was Telstar by the Tornados: brilliant. I liked 'Where Do You Go To My Lovely' by Peter Sarstedt, 'The House of the Rising Sun' by the Animals, 'Gimme Some Loving' by the Spencer Davis Group, and lots more, of course. I didn't take a lot of notice of the Beatles.  As a guy, fashion trends for me were combat jackets, hipsters, shirts in bright colours with long collars; I didn't take to kaftans. Daring was for girls who wore the first mini-skirts.  Women's liberation didn't affect me.  As far as movies are concerned, I liked The Guns of Navarone, The Magnificent Seven, Dirty Harry, Bullitt, Where Eagles Dare, The Quiller Memorandum, and they remain favourites to this day.|`|fQmJSlEyaa	I was 14 when they landed on the moon at the time it did not seem such a big deal ,it was older generation's that thought it was a grate achievment (which it was)   best groups for me were the small faces, amen corner and the trogs .     to be honest I had never even heard of the womens liberation movent in the 60's for me that was somthing that hapend in the 70's .Best film Iof the 60's were those with a social coment poor cow, up the junction and Alfi to name but a few|`|xKuWE9gfaa	I remember sitting with my landlady watching it on TV.

If Manuel required 2 hours to frame 5 pictures, then divide 2 by 5, to reveal that 0.4 hours (or 24 minutes) is needed for each picture.    If 16 pictures will require 0.4 hours each, then multiply 16 by 0.4, and this reveals that 6.4 hours total are required to frame everything.

This allowed them to gain supremacy over Spain on the high seas, which opened the door for English ships to travel the World and set up trade routes and Imperial Colonies all over the globe.    *Edit*  I wrote the wrong thing without thinking.

We offered railroads and new buildings and medical care which helped in the popuation increase in countries like India.

Or anyone believe that was throwing flowers...|`|olahi6esaa	It was actually mostly through trade. Through Royal Charters, trading companies, like the East India Company in East Asia and the Hudson Bay Company in North America, slowly gained control over more and more territories. They even had their own personal army and navy. They were then transferred directly to the British Crown. A relatively small percentage of the British Empire was conquered by the British army.|`|KuWLNfYbaa	Britain as an island had a seafaring and shipbuilding heritage which produced great explorers and pirates such as sir Francis Drake,Sir Walter Raleigh,Capt. Henry Morgan,Blackbeard,Calico Jack who sailed the seven seas and created great wealth for themselves and their country.Britain's navy was able to sail to foreign lands virtually unopposed and acquire territory quite easily from the native peoples who were technically and intellectually inferior due to poor or no education and no industry.Our battles on the Spanish main and with the French gave us control of the seas and the exploitation of the native peoples was a fairly easy unopposed  task as we developed their countries for them,whether they liked it or not|`|kJ4g1vujaa	Britain actually got two empires but I'm sure you are referring to the 18th century empire in India and Africa.    According to Paul Kennedy one of the reasons for Britains naval success was the tree, the Scots Pine which enabled Britain to build larger ships than other powers.    Success in the Napoleonic wars and success in defeating other European powers in India were also key.    edit:  the Spanish Armada (1588) was nothing to do with Trafalgar (1805).

AA10699315	Ashes (Book One in the Gray Area Series) by Stefanie Ellis:    Sidney Fox was your average seventeen-year old girl. She looked like everyone else, dressed like everyone else, harbored hopes and dreams...you guessed it, just like everyone else.    After a long and uneventful winter break, Sidney returned to the stale hallways and cranky teachers to find a new addition: a mysterious new student named Cael, he seemed to immediately fall into the role of the most popular person to ever step foot on campus. At first, Sidney was repulsed by the gaggle of girls that hung on his every word, that is, until he explained that he has no control over the attraction others have for him, its just one thing out of many that he is just as confused about as she is. Cael knows what he is, but he has no idea how or why. Their search for answers sends them across the world and forces them to go to extreme measures in order to get those answers.    City of Dreams (non-vampire related romance) by Stefanie Ellis:    Skyler Ashford is a confused, over-analyzing twenty-five year old.

The third book, City of Glass, is on shelves March 24. The romance reminds me a lot of Twilight, and the main male character, Jace, reminds me a lot of Edward. Not sure why, they're not THAT much alike. But he does. The books were also endorsed by Stephanie Meyer. She said, "The Mortal Instruments series is a story world that I love to live in. Beautiful!" There are vampires in the book, but the main characters aren't vampires.    Here is a brief synopsis from School Library Journal.    From School Library Journal  Grade 8 UpWhen Clary Fray witnesses three tattoo-covered teenagers murder another teen, she is unable to prove the crime because the victim disappears right in front of her eyes, and no one else can see the killers. She learns that the teens are Shadowhunters (humans who hunt and kill demons), and Clary, a mundie (i.e., mundane human), should not be able to see them either. Shortly after this discovery, her mother, Jocelyn, an erstwhile Shadowhunter, is kidnapped. Jocelyn is the only person who knows the whereabouts of The Mortal Cup, a dangerous magical item that turns humans into Shadowhunters. Clary must find the cup and keep it from a renegade sector of Shadowhunters bent on eliminating all nonhumans, including benevolent werewolves and friendly vampires. Amid motorcycles powered by demon energies, a telepathic brotherhood of archivists, and other moments of great urban fantasy, the story gets sidetracked by cutesy touches, like the toasted bat sandwich on the menu of an otherworldly restaurant. The characters are sporadically characterized and tend toward behavior that is both predictable and slightly repellentClary finds out who her real father is about 200 pages after readers will have it figured out. Despite the narrative flaws, this version of New York, full of Buffyesque teens who are trying to save the world, is entertaining and will have fantasy readers anxiously awaiting the next book in the series.Heather M.

AA12339318	A drawing is only one form of illustration.  Another could be a painting.  Even a photograph can be a form of illustration.    But, to split that hair even finer, some forms of drawing might not "qualify" to fit the definition of an illustration.  For example, if I were to go out with my sketch pad and do a few dozen quick sketches of the yucca plant in my back yard, I wouldn't call these illustrations until I took them back to my studio and worked up a more finished drawing from them.  That finished piece would be an illustration.    So, it's a LOT more that a "posh" way of saying the same thing.|`|PrpAxWsUaa	I think the difference between drawing and illustrating is that an illustration is a picture drawn for more of a purpose, as in to explain something. A drawing could just be a way to express your emotions, rather than portray a set image.|`|aw85XgQwaa	I think drawing and illustrating are the same. If a drawing is to be used in a book or advertising, it then becomes an illustration.|`|4TX26viFaa	Illustrating is a type of drawing, one that's intended to be published in a book, magazine, or visual media.  Drawing is more broad a term, and includes pictures to hang in the house.|`|pYe3kkgNaa	an illustration is used to furnish (a book, magazine, etc.) with drawings, pictures, or other artwork intended for explanation, elucidation, or adornment and to make clear or intelligible, as by examples or analogies.    an illustration is basically a drawing, it's just has a different purpose than any other drawings would,|`|Ok4lJYVYaa	nope illustrating is just the posh way of saying it.    Actually illustration can be used to be to portray something. A piece of art is more likely to be an illustration than a drawing. A drawing of something would be called an illustration, a doodle type drawing is a drawing. (if that makes sense)|`|xXWSpw5Saa	a illustration is usually in a book, and a drawing, it just pencil or markers|`|A4qtTlKSaa	An illustration tells a story where as a drawing could just be observational. Also illustrating can apply to both digitally and manually (usuing a computer or a pencil for example) making an image.    The word illustrate comes from the Latin illustrare to make light, explain.
teZvmrPVaa	snape is a hard person to understand and in addition to that fact, harry is very stupid and cant even see what is in front of him, let alone understand snape...|`|tZF1FO7saa	Because he was a Death Eater and Harry obviously hates Death Eaters as they are always trying to do him in.|`|WIguyGcZaa	Because of the way that he treated Harry in the very beginning, constantly giving him detentions and looking so suspicious in his direction. Mainly, Harry was suspicious of Severus because he had no idea what Snape was going through in his life until later on when he looked into Snape's penseive and was able to see inside Snape's mind. I just think that Harry wanted to be cautious around Snape because he never knew when Snape was going to be nice to him and when he was going to turn evil again.|`|zYZIw0Mqaa	Because of how Snape treats him, and the fact that he had a bite mark from Fluffy.|`|AmWWJ0n9aa	Because he doesn't know what's in Snape's mind, he only knows that Snape is horrible to him, so he builds up some big fat hate. Fair enough. There are a few unfortunate coincidences on Snape's part, as well.|`|qAZpWHKMaa	Because he was a jerk to him. AND Harry has a lot of his father in him, so, like his father, he didn't like Snape just because of how he acted.|`|phH2dVYZaa	Admit it - he's a dick to Harry in the first place    Though he's so adorable he makes up for it :D|`|AAHF9sA1aa	You have to admit that if you had a teacher who acted like they hated you, looked greasy/creepy, AND came from Slytherin, then you'd be suspicious of them, too. Plus, first impressions are hard to shake. Even though Snape's name was cleared, they spent a whole year distrusting him, which could be a hard feeling to just let go of.|`|gsQfKjgyaa	i think it was just because he acted so evil.

Your market niche for this could enjoy and relate to your experiences in this country.

A couple of paragraphs to summarize it is all you need at this point. Put each one on a separate page. Rearrange them in order, write a subplot the same way. Inter space it throughout the plot. The subplot is something that has to be solved or achieved to accomplish the goal of the plot. After you have them in an order you like, (mine took nearly a year) then you can begin writing the story. You add the details in the story as long as they carry you toward the next scene. The number of plot scenes should be twice as many as the number of subplot scenes, more or less.

Good luck and I hope you guys do good.|`|7VpDEkC6aa	OK the easiest one I can think of for how long you guys have been playing would be to do the guitar jam at the end of "Freebird" by Lynyrd Skynyrd    It's a simple rhythm riff.  and you can trade off the solos just like they do on the record.  Back when I was a teen int he 70's, I was teaching a friend how to play and that's one song we did together for practicing solos.  One guy plays the riff while the other one solos. then you trade off. when one guys finishes his little solo, he plays the rhythm along with the other guy one time then they switch places. you can do that as many times as you want or the crowd gets tired of it.....    The rhythm is simple power chords  G Bb  C   then E F F  G    Listen to the song to get the strum pattern.    you can use a simple Blues scale or maybe pentatonic scale for the solos|`|NuiHXYuOaa	best of 5 rounds (all rounds are done then winner declared at the end)    Acoustic round   Rock and roll  Punk rock round  Heavy Metal round  Homebrew shredding round! - choose your song and shred it up!

To be able to have a guitar battle you need to be able to improvise. To be able to improvise you need to be able to know scales and chords and the patterns they go in and what goes with what. In order to know what goes with what you need to know musical theory. To be able to know musical theory you need to hit the books before hitting the stage. Give it another 6 months of hard studying of musical theory then give it a try.|`|BqPr9jDUaa	I would choose a song you can both play that is more of a technical style. And you could play half and he could play half. But dont just play the first half and him the second half. Break it up like you take the first verse and you play chorus together then he plays the second verse.

i1JVe24Oaa	Why did you accept an invitation from somebody you don't want to go with in the first place? That was not the smartest move. Nevertheless, if they are friends, like you say, then let your date know that you are going as platonic friends and this is not a romantic date; also, you should be clear about the way you feel - you have many options.   You can talk to his friend about it,   you can talk straightly to him about it,   or you can ask him for a dance or something like that.       Honesty is always better than tears. And if you are not willing to take the risk, it's not even worth it.    Good luck!|`|VfcZvAbgaa	take the risk, tell him how you feel, if he says he doesn't like you in that way, he's not even worth it.

20kNV0ryaa	Just start by putting on music and moving around to it. Try not to be choppy, just natural. Its painful to watch choppy dancers! They look uncoordinated! Then start with some basics like leaps: getting fairly high in the air, having both legs straight, along with straight arms, one forward, one to the side, and then landing without sounding like an elephant jumping! Work on kicking; get as high as you possibly can with your leg straight. With EVERYTHING that you do when your feet are off the ground, point your feet so it looks nice and graceful. It looks so bad when people jump and they have flat clown-ish feet! Good luck! Also, look on youtube for some techniques, but those are just some starters. Good luckkk :D|`|kubvXL3Iaa	You can't teach yourself those techniques, you need a teacher because non-dancers don't notice what they are doing wrong because they don't know what to look for. Also, simple things like rolling through the foot need to be learned, you must be trained so they will be instilled in your muscles memory. For leaps, you will not always know if your back leg is straight. For ballroom, you'd need a partner most of the time. Have fun dancing, but to be technical, you really need professional teacher. Good luck!
7VpDEkC6aa	Go to any music store and buy a can of guitar polish.   I wouldn't use home furniture polish. maybe a non wax formula or something but not Pledge  or that kind of stuff.

S2ByqJSmaa	I think that the first story sounds most intriguing to me, though I would also read the second.    I would start the story number one first. You could even pull passages out of the Bible for the man to reference and use as back up for his recruiting children. Check the Old Testament first. Lots of punishing the wicked for the benefit of the poor and destitute.    Edit: I think that story has a lot of potential. A cultist perspective, or maybe this guy really is sent by God. Possibly he could have misinterpreted God's commandment.|`|WYfeH8nNaa	I think the second one sounds good also. The only thing I would suggest is to make the transmission sound more vague, not as clear as you told it.|`|5wg7tKc6aa	The second one sounds really good.|`|z9EGGerpaa	The first one sounds quite interesting. I would probably read it . . .    The second one sounds AMAZING! I would definately read it . . . .      Good luck. Hope to read your published books some day.
7VpDEkC6aa	A chord progression is simply any combination of chords in a certain key that repeats itself. or that can be played in that key.    for instance I used to play folk songs in church that had the chord progression C Am F G.  Then the progression just repeated itself.  That's the laymans explanation.....    I suppose a true definition would be for any Key the chord progression would be a list of all the chords in the scale for that key that can be played.  for example:  Key: C major scale  Name: Major triads I-ii-iii-IV-V-vi-vii*  Notes: C D E F G A B---that would be the chord progression for the C major scale  (man I hope I'm right...I don't want to look like a moron  LOL)    Go to this site to see more:  http://www.all-guitar-chords.com/chord_p...

Red-eye happens more with compact cameras because the flash and picture-taking lens are close to being on the same axis. It happens very much less with a separate flash unit, even when mounted on the camera, because of the increased distance between lens and flash.|`|5BiBamrxaa	Red eye is the on camera flash being reflected from the blood vessels of the eye.  Not everyone in a group shot will have it as they are of centre to the flash.  "red eye reduction" - the clue is in the phrase - reduction... it will not do away with it totally.    To avoid red-eye the flash needs to be "off camera" if you have a point and shoot then you will get some degree of red eye whenever flash is used.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	First off, most replies are correct, it's simply a reflection of light and it is quite common. To correct this either the flash should not be so close to the lens, lights in the room should be turned up high to make the pupil contract or the picture should be taken at a slight angle, slightly downwards on the subject is good.    As far as eye cancer, it is white eye, not red eye that indicates a problem.http://www.eyecancermd.org/retinoblastom...  so don't worry about illness.|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	Nothing to worry about, like the other user said some people eyes do it more than others, usually with people with lighter color eyes (hazel, green, blues).  It can be corrected in any paint program or software that came with the camera.  Go out and take as many pictures as you want.    Unless you believe it is capturing your soul  HEHE|`|qMBYdRudaa	its just some peoples eyes have the tendency to reflect more light than others. Even with the red eye reduction feature on it still will not compensate for this|`|R4WX5twzaa	if you don't want red-eye, don't use a point-and-shoot camera. the red-eye is caused by the red light that the camera uses to auto-focus on the subjects. it's pretty annoying, but it's something that can easily be fixed in photoshop.|`|0c338ca1fa4feadaf2979b7b59e65cebaa	Yes, it means you are a spawn of Satan. Have a nice day.|`|jtoxFsdYaa	Red eye is simply caused by the light from a flash gun being reflected by the blood vessels at the back of the eye. You will only notice this effect with flash photography because flash is used in low light situations where the subject's pupils would be open much wider to allow in more light. Red eye reduction relies on a brief pre-flash to cause the subjects pupils to dilate momentarily, thus reducing the amount of light to go in to, and be reflected from the subjects eyes when the main flash fires.|`|ZHniWW26aa	It's reduction it wouldn't take it completely away from everyone you shouldn't worry yourself. That happened when I took a picture my horse's eyes were red and he's fine.

MYkqiYSzaa	Hi Tiago:      Symphonies do use a bass.  But, they are not your electric basses found in rock and roll bands. The basses used in a symphony orchestra are shaped like a violin, and because of there large size, are played standing up, unlike a cello, which is played sitting down.        Other names for the bass is: contrabass, bass viol, standup bass, string bass, and acoustic bass.        By the way, the tuning on one of these instruments is the same as on an electric bass.        For a detailed history on this instrument, heres a link you might find interesting.              http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bass|`|w13Zbnk7aa	orchestras have a "bass" but it's not the kind of bass you're thinking of. It's like a cello. Also, low intruments like trombones are sometimes used to play the melody line (mostly one the beat).

In my honest opinion you should go for your friends. Friends do not leave you anything.. that is not always true. Your friends are those who help you get through life, who give you support when you're down, and are their for you when you need them the most. Material objects are only material things and will deteriorate. They don't speak to you, they don't make you laugh, they don't hang out with you. Friends are more important, and it all depends on which friends you choose.

He imagined a whole entire escape and return to freedom only to be brought back to reality at the moment of his death while still in captivity.     6 I forgot who was on which side, but you sympathies with the prisoner. The sympathy is especially evident as he imagines a return to his wife and home, and not some sort of revenge against the people trying to kill him.
