omegLbOAaa	play around with the Sherwin Williams color visualizer to help you imagine how the colors will look together. It is the best paint visualizer on the web, imho.

zk6y1Va3aa	Kiwis are produced from vines and they need a temperate climate with 'adequate' summer heat.  My book doesn't tell me what adequate equates to, but I'm assuming Atlanta gets that heat.  The only problem I can see with growing your own kiwi is that vines are usually propagated by grafting.  The only kiwi I've ever seen that you buy seed for is an ornamental fruit rather than an edible.  All of the edible varieties generally have to be bought live.  That said, when you are growing from seeds you have to let them dry first.  Generally a week or so does it.  Then, especially with something that you don't know what it looks like when it sprouts, you probably want to plant the seeds shallowly in seed packs.  I'd recommend four to six seeds per pack.  After they have sprouted and grown two sets of leaves you can transplant them to a full sun area with something for them to climb against.  A fence or stone/brick wall would work well.  Another problem with kiwi is that they have male and female plants.  If you have only one or the other then you won't get fruit.  You have to have at least one of each so that they can cross pollinate.  Also, bees don't seem to like kiwi fruit so you will need to do the pollination yourself.  Take a *soft* paintbrush and gather the pollen from the male plant and then dust it onto the center of the female plant.  Good luck!|`|ef5KDy0Gaa	they must go through a drying process/ and a cooling process.exp. refrigerate 4 2 days. then u can plant them in miracle grow potting soil.Keep in mind if its a hybrid they wont reproduce, and kiwi's love warm humid climates.. hope this helps

B4O3f8w6aa	Turn off the cold water supply valve and disconnect the hose at the unit. Check the screen which may be in the hose or on the washer. It may be clogged. If this is okay, your switch may be bad and not opening the cold water side.|`|XpkhUBkGaa	Chances are the cold water solenoid is faulty. If you're handy, you could either test the continuity of the solenoid or if you don't have a tester, reverse the wires on the hot / cold solenoid and see if the hot water comes out when you select cold. or cold water comes out if you select hot. If, after you reverse the wires, there is no cold water coming out when you select hot, then you are pretty safe in assuming the solenoid has failed.

5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Wow! What a coincidence, so did mine! In my case, the heater stopped making heat effectively making into a tumble dryer with just unheated air. In my case, lint had gotten into the relay contacts which control the heating elements so even though the contacts closed, they did not make electrical contact and no electricity got to the heating element. Power.... Did you check your electrical panel to be sure you do not have a blown fuse or a tripped circuit breaker? Obvious, I know, but many people will NOT check the power supply as the first thing with a major appliance such as a dryer. OK, so behind the panel is a circular switch with cams which turn and operate switches. It is likely the switch which activates the dryer has failed. In my Kenmore there is a relay which controls the whole rest of the dryer. Turning the knob closes a switch, but nothing happens until I press the START button. The start button bridges a set of relay contacts which if the cam switch is closed, then closes the relay which stays latched when I release the START button. It may be something as simple as the START button failed and no longer makes electrical contact. If so, easy to swap out and relatively cheap. The hard part, getting TO the start buton. But since it IS so simple, it is also unlikely to fail. Anyway, the dryer then runs and a clock motor turns the cams until the cam switch opens, which de-energizes the relay and the whole dryer stops. How handy are you doing surgery? If you think you have the skill, first, PULL THE PLUG. Check it TWICE. Then pull out your trusty Phillips screwdriver and start removing panels to get at the console switches behind the knob. It is possible that it is simply dirty contacts from corrosion. You can TRY pulling off any connections designed to do so and then put them back where they came from, one at a time so you do not get any mixed up. Close up the panels and plug in the dryer and try it. If no go, then it is likely there has been a physical failure, something is broken in the complex mechanism of the switch unit. It has a lot of moving parts. If any one of the internal switches operated by cams fails, there is no fixing it, but rather replacing the entire assembly. My switch is riveted together making it impossible to disassemble. Call your local Sears store and check the availability of parts. If you have to replace the switch assembly, be prepared for sticker shock. It is probably the MOST expensive individual part. Like I said, how comfortable are you with doing surgery yourself? If you have any qualms, then call Sears and have one of their repair people look at it. If you call in repair, your major cost will be labor over and above the cost of parts. One thing about Kenmore is high quality so they tend to last a long time, but when they break, it also costs a lot to repair. My Kenmore has been running reliably for over 30 years with only ONE major repair, the clock motor stopped turning, and one belt replacement for the drum, and a few squirts of oil on the wheels that support the drum to stop them from squeaking which is not too bad all in all.|`|999ecae3bd7991db2c05cbeac24ab665aa	check your power source. also check to see it the push pin which is inside the door is not broken off. this pin pushes a plate in a hole that tells the machine that the door is open or closed. if pin is broken off or bent then dryer will not run.|`|eb1eB1hCaa	its old. and when things are old they stop working. go get a new one.|`|bde0658d8cf48c30a8b439401bea4981aa	try unplugging it and plugging it in in another plug, or just wait a while and see what happens, otherwise it is dead.

Some people wait years for theirs to start blooming, so you are lucky.  I just hope you like pruning, as this needs it frequently.  You are wise to keep it out of the other tree, as it could get up and out of your reach very quickly.

But if you plan on putting in a pool later, wouldn't a little greenery until then be better than a patch of barren ground that you would get from salt or herbicide?

968cefc02d8bcb76be7a1153f3194673aa	It depends on the type of wallpaper.  Find a small inconspicuous portion and wash with warm water and mild soap. Keep trying stronger and stronger mixes until you see slight damage on the paper. If it's good washable paper you can use this great stuff called "bam", just spray it on and it dissolves the smoke residue, then just wipe down with warm water.  Good luck.

CHfL1SDcaa	this completely depends on your own taste.. have a look at some interior magazines or sites (living etc is a favourite of mine).

oIRLs6Spaa	What you are describing is called stratification.  Using tap water for stratification won't harm the seeds, but you don't want to use tap water to water your plants.  The reason is that there are dissolved solids in tap water that can build up in the soil and eventually kill the plant.  This is not a problem for stratifying though.<br>  <br>  However, Dionaea seeds do not need to be stratified.  If I were you, I'd take them out of the fridge and put them on some peat moss and put them in a sunny window.  If you're lucky, you'll see germination in a couple weeks, but it might take as long as 4 weeks.  Chances are that you won't get any germination because the seeds in the kit are too old.<br>  <br>  If that's the case, and you can wait a few months, I'll have a ton of seed and I'll be giving it away on my website forum:<br>  <a href="http://www.flytrapcare.com/phpBB3/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flytrapcare.com/phpBB3/</a><br>  I hope to see you on the forum!|`|08a92b58f4c232dc4f67d55c8ffecf70aa	i don't know about venus trap, but tap water is not that deadly.<br>  i worry more about the fridge.... does it suppose to grow on winter?|`|g58DJ2rKaa	it might kill your plant because chlorine is not good for venus fly traps

XYOYml59aa	It is possible you over tightened it, it may also not be tight enough. <br>  <br>  I would try tightening it to the point were it is snug, doesn't move a lot if at all, but any rubber parts still keep a close to same shape as what they started as.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, it may just be bad/defective. At that point I would try to either exchange it or buy new rubber parts. If you can't find them, you could always work something out with normal washer and some silicon, just be creative. It may not last as long (but you never know).<br>  <br>  You should also look for any cracks, chips, etc. in the tank. It may not be the rubber parts but other things around it. even a little chip in the bolt or something.|`|tSwCd5kvaa	Someone kicked it in|`|AA10006699	u either have a tank to bowl gasket leaking or the wax ring under the toilet is leaking when u flush.

Enjoy it.|`|vG4wTvYuaa	tape pictures and put small knick knacks on it. there of tons of things you can do, especially with the sides, to make it more your own. a nice scarf or two on it and using the top for a shelf for framed pictures of your friends or whatever you like will make it seem more 'yours' Bright colors will contrast nicely with it :)
yrx6GxDcaa	I would use secrete all you have to do is pour the powder in the hole and add water. Also put a rock at the bottom of the hole to set the pole on and then add the secrete that way no dirt or moisture will get to the pole and cause rotting. This is a good idea if you want the fence to be around for a long time. Set all the poles first and give the secrete overnight to cure before setting up the fence. You can do as much as you want depending on how much you are putting up. Make sure all your measurements are right to connect the fencing to the poles. I put up a bamboo one 120 feet long took my time worked on it a little every day it took me 3 weeks but it turned out great.|`|xRgxW2RPaa	use the cement. Not clear on Stick pole description but anchoring you verticals keeps you hard work from sagging or swaying over time.  We put up our own 6ft privacy fence over a weekend but it took a few extra people and we hired out a man to auger out the holes, not that expensive considering the saved back aches.
FxWppY7Baa	Not so much tiring but incredibly time consuming. irrigating 2 acres this way takes a person about 7 hours a day to get a decent amount of water to all the plants. this should be done several times a week in droughty conditions which means most other chores on the farm, such as harvest, weeding, etc., would go undone.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, when you use a hose you have to be very careful where you drag the thing-it can wipe our whole ares in just a few seconds. This means you have to take extra time when moving from bed to bed and moving through a bed. nothing like a heavy water filled hose breaking the stem of a prized plant you have spent the season growing and nurturing.<br>  <br>  I know this from experience and that is why about 10 years ago my farm invested in a drip irrigation system to irrigate about 3 acres of mixed produce. now it takes one person about an hour a day to turn on the system, check drip tapes for leaks and switch sections so the entire area gets watered. drip irrigation uses about 90% less water than sprinklers or a hose.|`|AA12391712	yes, particularly when you put it that way|`|4rAVqid3aa	Depends on your stamina of your arms and finger. Imagine dragging about twelve pounds of water in half of hour. Is it exhausting?<br>  <br>  Why don't you build an irrigation system? Like pipes with holes with one valve.<br>  It saves time and anyway plants need water regularly, not just once.
GyB5Yfgmaa	I put my in for the back yard and front yard for $1200 parts and labor.|`|dso5JZtBaa	not really. you can get a cheap one for 1-3$ at walmart. or a beter one for 6-10$.|`|DBjqfg7qaa	In California you will pay about $300 to $500 per valve station installed, including parts. Make sure the installer ONLY does sprinklers and not a concrete guy or gardener who does them on the side (you'll get ripped off most of the time because they usually don't know what they're doing). You can normally put up to 15 pop-ups (but better to stop at 12) on a single valve and for lawn they should be no more than 10-12 feet apart, giving you head to head coverage. Make sure they install a separate shut of valve for the sprinkler system so you can turn off the water to the sprinklers without turning off the water to the house.|`|KShLoAGyaa	No they are economic. The cost varies from country to country in any case it costs around 25USD$ to 50$. Some spriklers are fitted on running water lines some are handoperated.

That is, if you are allowed. When I was a teen in the 70s my mother would only let me hang my own artwork on the wall, and only if it were framed to her specifications. I had friends with disco balls and lava lamps who had stamped their walls with foot print stamps and anything else they felt like doing. I get the feeling that you are a sentimental sort of person, so I would say lots of pictures of friends and family in cool frames, maybe a big bulletin board with notes from friends, lots of mirrors to make the room look bigger, flowering plants in cute pots to add color and fragrance. I love chimes and mobiles hanging from the the wall. Another thing you could do is add a border to your walls, you can find them wherever wall paper is sold.|`|QCTiZnz0aa	Textures and Hangings Are Unique Wall Decorating Styles, The first idea you can use is to add texture to the wall surface, such as gluing straw or paper bags to your wall. you can find some other solutions, read more at <a href="http://homeremodelinghelp.blogspot.com/2009/03/textures-and-hangings-are-unique-wall.html" rel="nofollow">http://homeremodelinghelp.blogspot.com/2...</a>|`|CyznHT6saa	What are you intrested in.<br>  <br>  <br>  I like too think of a room wall like demi lovatos CD cover, or a photoshoot of miley cyrus with a bunch or random phrases on the wall, and on the wall behind your bed or wherever you can stick your pictures, and posters.|`|zDsW8O0waa	get a bigg poster board thingy. sharpies. and a group of friends. have them and u write inside jokes/lovenotes/all that stuff all over itt. its soooo cute my friend did itt :]]]<br>  answeremine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkmJWTANV.fWdV_LAWd4njfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306222128AA4BsX1">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|GZip4aEfaa	try different colours, designs and stuff and search the internet for samples and go to a store where you get the stuff and ask their opinion too and then make your decision.<br>  good luck|`|78naDdXXaa	Well...what I was going to say when I read your headline was paint a mural on it. But...it looks like you're looking for something different. If I were you...I would do something along the lines of taking a lot of picture and then putting them all over your wall. I have a friend who does this and it actually looks kinda neat. She also makes these really cool print outs of her favorite quotes and puts them up there too.  And then...to top it all off, she puts random thing hanging from strings on her ceiling...for instance she loves mexico, so she has  a bunch of shot glasses from all the different places she's been hanging from the ceiling. Pretty awesome I gotta say. Hope this helps. =)

Gzk1TQFAaa	You could use a scrubby, some Comet and scrub it off or...<br>  you can spray a little oven cleaner on it and let the chemicals do the hard work.  Be sure to wear gloves!  To bring back the shine to pot and pans and grills wipe a little reconstituted lemon juice on it.  The lemon juice also neutralizes any chemical residue.<br>  If you use the oven cleaner, it works better if the pan is hot.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	Get some Barkeeper's Friends.  It's a powdered cleanser, kind of like a scouring powder, but more of a polish.  It's cheap and works great!  It does wonders for anything metal!<br>  <br>  When you get the Barkeeper's, dampen the pan, sprinkle on some of the cleanser and walk away for 10-15 minutes.  Then scrub with a sponge with one of those scrubber things on it.  This time it's going to take some elbow grease and probably a couple times of putting on the cleanser and waiting but it will eventually take it all off.  Then use the cleanser regularly to keep the pans shining.  I use this stuff on all my stainless, my big copper bowl (works better than anything else I've found), have used it to clean and polish silver and brass.  It also removes rust from metal.  And it doesn't tear your hands up either!|`|DUOoMBqoaa	SOS pads and elbow grease.|`|35qbxLCpaa	My last trick that seems to work for me is by adding some soda salt in warm water and detergent and let it soak for a night.

You might have to scrub a little.<br>  PS - burnt areas will always come back. Excess heat causes that.
28eef552af05089e5c3e3e4bda7ed4a9aa	most greens need some kind of light to grow. If you're doing this outside you might tilt an old storm window in front of the plants to draw more warmth. Try fresh spinach, snow peas, leaf lettuce and patio tomatoes.|`|x86mC8yyaa	If you have a greenhouse, or maybe a conservatory or even a sunny windowsill, you could grow salad plants such as winter varieties of lettuce or salad leaves, radishes, and lambs lettuce. Also sprouting seeds would take about a week to 10 days and you could keep a good succession going. If by 'make a meal with' you mean the more filling kind of vegetables like carrots or potatoes, these would take longer and would need warmer summer conditions to develop.|`|AA10567932	Radishes, lettuce and spinach grows fast and in cold weather.

Good luck to you and your girls!!! x|`|aZXnW6AUaa	abosoultly.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	I just saw one like that in the area I am applying for and wondered about it.  It said two bedrooms but suitable for one person or a couple over 25 with no kids.  I wonder whether it was the same area lol.<br>  <br>  I thought it was weird too!  What would happen if a couple moved into it and had kids?  Would they have to move out?|`|U02Ku6jpaa	it would'nt do any harm to apply. It might show how eager you are.Write a letter saying what you said in the question and send it to the chief housing officer|`|mnaNKujPaa	It might be due to community building. The place and the neighbours may not be suited to a family. I know an elderly lady who had been in her flat for decades and a family with two kids moved in above her and her life became hell with the heavy footsteps and general noise. She ended up leaving her neighbours to go into a bungalow on the other side of town so she could sleep. I understand you are frustrated and want to move - you clearly aren't homeless if you have been on the list 2 years with children - it is not up to you to judge the suitability of a property. families usually get housed into houses where possible as these tend to have gardens and are better for children. Be patient apply for any properties you are eligible for as sooner or later somewhere will come up for you. If you are made homeless then you have to be housed but you also have to take whatever you are offered so beware.|`|rTLWzNCOaa	I think they may have said its for a couple because it might be a very small flat, i live in northern ireland & i think things are different here because the council do not advertise properties, its just the luck of the draw & they are very secretive about where you are on the housing list & what properties are available. here, we just have to wait our turn till an offer comes in the post.<br>  <br>  if i was you & planning on staying there a long time & making it your family home, i would hold out for a house & try & gain more points, by moving in with a family member & getting over crowed points or by declaring yourself homeless & moving into temporary accomodation.
Gd3fvciaaa	I would go with earth tones.<br>  browns, tans, greens,grays, some reds|`|AA10042205	Do you love the existing tub, why not put a new walk in shower with 2-heads, synthetic marble walls, a shower light, or a new Jacuzzi.  If the reason for not taking it out is because it is a heavy cast iron tub, they can be removed with a 10-pound sledge hammer.  Get a worker to start pounding right on the wall of the tub right in the middle closer to the bottom.  It will take several blows, but it will soon break, then the rest is easier to start breaking up for removal.  If it is a cheep steel tub they can't be broken, they just start bending.  You have to remove them by removing a end wall, which is easy.  Just put it back like you found it.  If it is a fiberglass tub, use a reciprocating saw and cut it out.  Now back to your original question to be answered by others.|`|7z3e2vuvaa	If it has a shower I wouldn't recommend wallpaper, The humidity from the shower will end up making it peel over time.<br>  If the room has bad lighting you'll be better off using lighter, natural earth tones.|`|AA11661950	Paint the walls pink and the trim can be white or a natural wood if it's a light shade like white oak.
fPLv0QrSaa	If it is older then probably not. I don't think my newer dishwasher even used electricity. Unplugging a cell phone charger won't make much of a difference if at all. At 8 cents per kilowatt, it would take 41 days to save 8 cents but that is if you never used it. If you charge for 8 hours a day, it would take 63 days to save 8 cents. If you want to save energy, the best way is to look for things that heat and cool. Turning your heater down can have a huge impact. You could also put jugs of water in your fridge if it is mostly empty. This will retain the coldness when you open the door.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	Dish washer normally arent plugged in they are hard wired into your house. I seriously doubt that it is using any minuscule amount of electric especially if it is older. <br>  <br>  Put this silly idea out of your head. even if you had a newer dishwasher that does used a couple pennies a day. pulling the dishwasher out every day is just asking to get shorts or break hoses.

i7izz6zdaa	just something to consider here. if you use lightweight insulation, you really aren't making much of a difference. denser insulation adds weight to the door which means you need to get stronger springs to compensate for the added weight. failure to do so might mean you will be force to replace a damaged door later on. even with the better insulation (in your case, probably 2 inches of styrofoam) you aren't adding a significant R value to the door, most likely only 4 or 5 points. after all is said and done, you have invested time and money to improve an old door and are left with a marginal improvement. improving the door can be done so don't think i'm trying to sell anything, but it's not just a matter of slapping panels of insulation in and living happily ever after. i've seen it done many times (i live in the northeast) and i really think you will be better off saving for a new door.|`|BFai5l9gaa	I recommend buying the higher-end doors with the high-density urethane fill and interlocking panels.

0sDveBfsaa	Normally Bonding for deep holes and if just a bare wall then you'd coat it with browning.|`|QI74CxD0aa	You are talking about the  "brown coat" in traditional plastering.  You won't find this material in the big home centers.  Look for specialty suppliers of gypsum products.   The brown coat of plaster need to be built up on the lathe in layers and allowed to dry in between.  You may need to use metal mesh for a deep hole.   When the plaster is built up to almost the level of he wall, then you apply the skim coat, which you mix up by combining hydrated lime and gouging plaster.   The same supply houses would have those products, too.   Look for instructions on the web sites for the manufacturers like USG  and in the National Parks' Service   Restoration Guides.   Good luck.|`|Brr6b37raa	Depends on how big and how deep the whole is its best to use bonding, than finish it off with finish plaster|`|j6yiw1Hmaa	The stuff used for a deep patch has more glue in it to make it stronger, don't use finishing mud for this purpose.<br>  Fill up the hole with wadded up newspaper. get some sticky-back nylon mesh tape, put it in the wall to give the mud someplace to stick to and fill the hole.

When concrete in basements draw water it will eventually cause the walls or floor to fail in some way.  Where the water is is also important.  Is it in the middle of basement and does not appear to be coming from a side wall?  Is the water seeping in or gushing in?  If the side walls are wet is it at a seam or crack?  <br>  <br>  And should you want to store something in the basement you will run the risk of mold and odors in your items.<br>  <br>  Before you buy a house you should ask for a home inspection.

ZGQO4ZVPaa	Bonsai hobbyists have been debating this very thing for as long as there as been bonsai. Everyone has their own recipe. Some don't even use soil, they only use akadama (a bonsai potting medium from Japan that is mostly baked clay from a special area in Japan). Others don't use anything in particular.<br>  <br>  Start with a very well draining sterile potting soil. Then look up info on the tree you will be growing and tailor it for the needs of the tree. For example, an andromeda (Pieris) likes acidic soil, so you might add coffee grounds to the soil for that. <br>  <br>  I use a standard potting soil mix that I buy from Lowes or Home Depot. I add a handful or two of perlite or vermiculite to it, mix it well for a standard, general mix. Pines might get a handful or two of extra sand and/or coffee grounds added to the soil for them. For succulents, I add more perlite to the general mix to make it even more well-draining.<br>  <br>  The Mystery of Bonsai Soil<br>   <br>  One bonsai soil mixture will not do for everyone or every tree. While we all want a light, well-draining soil, one person's light, well-draining soil is not likely to be exactly the same as your light, well-draining soil. Nor is the soil you chose for a bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) likely to be the same as that used for a southern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana).<br>  <br>  The soil you use for your trees will depend on: Your Climate, The trees you grow, and Your bonsai habits.<br>  <br>  The basic composition of a bonsai soil consists of 1/3 coarse sand -- grains of 1/8 to just under 1/4 inch, with the smaller sizes preferred -- to promote drainage; 1/3 an organic component, such as ground sphagnum moss or pine or fir bark, that retains moisture and holds nutrients, and 1/3 of a coarse, fired clay (many bonsaiists use a product called Turface, but there are other, similar products) also to help retain nutrients and moisture. You can start with the 1/3-1/3-1/3 mixture and play with the proportions until you find the one that works for you and your trees.<br>  <br>  A bonsaiist from the damp Pacific Northwest grows some of his trees in soils that consist primarily of fir bark, sometimes with some granite chips or coarse sand mixed in. A bonsai nurseryman from the hotter and drier part of northern California, also uses a more or less pure fir bark for growing many of his pre-bonsai. His mix is: ". . . Very coarse with very large air spaces. The amount of fine material should vary according to the container size. In small pots very fine material is to be avoided, the perfect size would be about 1/4 inch or a little less with no fines." The mixture you end up with likely will be the result of a few years of trial and error, after starting with the basic three-part mix.<br>  <br>  You can buy pre-packaged "bonsai soil," but if you have more than two or three trees, buying dirt can become expensive. Your best bet is to purchase the components and mix your own. Many local bonsai clubs will go together to purchase bonsai soil in bulk. This is slightly less expensive. It is cheapest, however, to make your own. Nurseries sell pine or fir bark mulch (get the mulch, not the landscaping 'nuggets'). The sand can be bought from a quarry. Coarse sandblasting sand is inexpensive. The sand used for swimming pool filters, while a bit fine, is adequate. For the clay, use Turface or a similar fired-clay material marketed as a soil conditioner. Some growers use a product called "Oil Dry" sold at auto supply stores. Other brand names include "Mule Mix," and "Terra-Green."<br>  <br>  Here's a brief list of the possible components of a good soil. Most of these materials will be available from a well-stocked nursery, but we have added suggestions (in parentheses) for finding the less common materials:<br>  <br>      * Organic material<br>      * Organic peat humus<br>      * Sphagnum peat moss<br>      * Composted material,<br>      * Composted horse or cow manure compost -- NOTE: often is too fine grained -- (farm or stables, for do-it- yourself composters)<br>      * Water-holding material<br>      * Turface,<br>      * Terragreen,<br>      * Mule Mix, etc. (farm supply stores. Also sold as a soil "conditioner" for baseball infields)<br>      * Orchid bark Pine (or fir) bark<br>      * "Oil Dry" (from auto supply stores)<br>      * Drainage material<br>      * Granite chicken grit (farm and feed stores)<br>      * Crushed oyster shell grit -- Note: May cause soils to become slightly less acidic (farm and feed stores in the south)<br>      * Quartz grit (farm and feed stores)<br>      * Coarse sand (sand and gravel pits, quarry)<br>      * River gravel (sand and gravel pit, quarry)<br>      * Aquarium gravel (pet supplies - expensive)<br>      * Volcanic sand (sometimes hard to find and too fine)<br>      * Sand blasting sand (some builder's supply stores, or sand blasting firm)<br>      * Crushed volcanic rock (aquarium supply)<br>      * Perlite<br>      * Vermiculite<br>  * Haydite<br>  <br>  We began this section by noting that the soil you choose depends on three things -- Your climate, the trees you grow, and your bonsai habits. Let's take these, one at a time.<br>  <br>  If you live in the desert of south Texas, you'll choose a different soil than someone might use in the humid southeast, or that someone up in Raleigh-Durham might need. The soil you choose may be heavier, and may retain more moisture than these other soils -- but as a desert dweller you still may have to water twice a day in mid summer. So, the humidity, the amount of rain you have, the summer heat (and to a lesser extent, winter cold), and the number of cloudy versus sunny days all become factors in your decisions about soils.<br>  <br>  To a large extent, the trees you grow also will depend on your climate. But you do have some latitude, here. If you prefer trees that prefer damp, sometimes outright swampy habitats, your choice of soil often is one that holds more water than most. Other bonsaiists may prefer trees that grow on upland, drier sites -- beech, hornbeam, dogwood, sand pine. They would choose a lighter, more fast-draining soil -- one with more sand or pine bark in it than mine might have.<br>  <br>  Only you know your bonsai habits. Do you water religiously? Do you check each tree and water it individually? Do you water your trees all at once -- whether some of them really need it or not? Do you sometimes miss a day here and there? How you work with your trees can affect the soil you choose. If you water en mass, every day in the hot summers, you might consider a freely draining soil (depending on the trees). If you are a fussy waterer, and water each tree according to its needs, you can more closely match the soil to each tree. If you tend to be more haphazard about your watering, or are often out of town for a day or two, a soil that holds water might be called for.<br>  <br>  No book  can make those decisions for you.<br>  <br>  One of the most widely debated subjects for most bonsai enthusiasts is soil composition. Ready-mixed soils can be bought from bonsai nurseries and garden centres but these tend to be relatively expensive. Faced with more than 3 or 4 trees to repot in the Spring, most enthusiasts learn to mix their own soils.<br>  <br>  There are a large number of soil ingredients that can be used when mixing your own soil; different mixes are used by different enthusiasts with varying degrees of success. For the beginner, choosing which soil mix to use can be a daunting choice. <br>  <br>  This article is written as an introduction to Bonsai soils, it does not discuss every soil ingredient or mix that is available, nor does it tell which soil mix is the 'best'. That question can only be answered by the individual enthusiast after experimenting over time with his own trees and care routines.<br>   <br>  The Basic Requirements Of Bonsai Soils<br>  <br>  A bonsai is confined to a relatively small quantity of soil throughout the year on which its very existence depends. Through the soil in the pot, the tree must be able obtain water, nutrients and gases in order to grow. For this reason, the soil that the tree is planted in must be of the correct quality. The quality of the soil that is used directly affects the health and vigour of the tree.<br>  <br>  There are two basic qualities that are required in a good soil mix;<br>  Good water-retaining and nutrition-absorbing capacity. <br>  Often provided by the use of dead organic matter/ Humus, the soil needs to be able to hold and retain sufficient quantities of water and nutrients for the tree to absorb. <br>  <br>  Good drainage. <br>  If excess water is not able to drain immediately from the pot, the rootsystem will be prone to rotting. Drainage is normally provided by the use of grit or small stone which keeps the mixture 'open', allowing excess water to pass through the mix freely. Good drainage also allows air to penetrate the compost, which is required by the plant.<br>    <br>  Varying Soil Mixtures To Suit Different Tree Species<br>  <br>  Though all Bonsai require free-draining, water-retentive soils, different species vary in their requirements for water and nutrients and this should be reflected in their soil composition. Pines and Junipers for instance require less water than most other species; this in turn means that they require a less water retentive soil mix.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, flowering and fruiting species have increased water requirements and tend to be planted in soil mixes with relatively high water retaining capacities. <br>  <br>  When mixing your own soil, the ratio of water-retaining material to grit is varied according to the tree that the mix is intended for. By increasing the ratio of grit to the mix, the soil becomes more freely-draining; by increasing the amount of water-retentive material, the greater the water-holding capacity.<br>   <br>  Organic or Inorganic Soils<br>  <br>  Soil mixes are described as being either organic or inorganic; both types contain grit to aid drainage but the water retentive ingredient(s) differ. Organic soil mixes are made up of dead plant matter such as peat and the ingredients are easily available at garden centres and DIY stores. Inorganic soil mixes contain no organic matter; instead, specially-formulated soil conditioners ranging from volcanic lava to calcined (baked) clays are used. These materials can be harder to locate, but, are available from good garden centers and bonsai nurseries.<br>   <br>  Basic or Organic Soil Mix<br>  <br>  The basic soil mix for bonsai has, for many years been grit and peat, mixed to a ratio of around 50/50. The peat holds water and nutrients whilst the grit provides drainage and keeps the soil open. The peat used is moss peat rather than sedge peat, the grit, either flint grit or crushed granite. All ingredients should be sifted to remove particles smaller than 2mm.<br>  <br>  There are other organic substitutes for peat; leaf mould and composted bark are sometimes used along with other peat substitutes.  Farmyard manure, garden compost or garden soils should never be used as they are of questionable quality and frequently carry soil-borne diseases. <br>  <br>  The standard mix for bonsai is 50/50 peat to grit, but when repotting Junipers, Pines and other species that require a free-draining mix, the percentage of grit should be increased to as much as 75/25.<br>  <br>  Inorganic Soil <br>  <br>  In the past decade, there has been a significant move towards inorganic soils. Though organic soils are cheaper and more easily available, they are also of inferior quality. Peat and peat substitutes have many disadvantages; they can be too water retentive, holding large quantities of water for long periods. This can lead to the soil mix being continually sodden, particularly during periods of rain in the Autumn, Winter and Spring. Conversely, during periods of high temperatures, dry peat can be difficult to re-wet properly.  Organic soils also continue to break down and relatively quickly become compacted and poor-draining. All these factors can lead to root problems and in particular root-rot.<br>  <br>  The advantage of inorganic materials is that they hold their open structure for a long time without breaking down into a mush. Inorganic materials retain a certain quantity of water and any excess is immediately flushed through the bottom of the pot; it is difficult to over-water a bonsai planted in a good inorganic soil mix. <br>  <br>  There are a number of materials that can be used along with grit when mixing an inorganic soil mix, ranging from volcanic lava to baked/fired clay granules; <br>  <br>  Akadama is a white Japanese clay, specifically produced for bonsai; it is normally only available from bonsai nurseries so can be difficult to buy. There are a number of grades of Akadama available including 'double redline' that is more costly but is of premium quality. Avoid buying low quality Akadama as it can lose its structure quickly in European and US climates where frequent watering during the Summer is necessary. <br>  <br>  Seramis  is an orange baked clay, similar to higher-grade Akadama. It is far more easily available in the UK and US where it can be purchased from good garden centres. An advantage of Seramis is that it turns a different shade of orange as it dries allowing an easy indication that it requires watering; the colour is not to everyone's taste but when top-dressed with grit it is not particularly noticeable. It does however retain its open structure for a long period of time.<br>  <br>  Fired clays are excellent soil materials but are costly and can be difficult to locate. They do however hold enormous amounts of water whilst remaining very free-draining.<br>  <br>  Crushed lava rock is rock produced from cool lava foramtion, usually found in Japan or Hawaii. Lava rock is used widely by many bonsai nurseries s a component of their potting mixtures. The most common mixure is 50/50 crushed lava cinders, and chopped pine bark. Crushed lava rocks also makes a excellent top dressing for bonsai.<br>  <br>  There are also a number of cheaper soil materials available at most garden centers, they are often sold as soil conditioners. These products can be used instead of baked clays or alternatively they can be mixed with clays to bring down the total cost of the soil mix which is often necessary for repotting large numbers of trees!<br>  <br>  Perlite is a naturally occurring, volcanic rock that is heated to a high temperature. As with baked clays, it is very well structured but also holds large quantities of water. It is also a very light material that makes it useful for reducing the weight of large pots.<br>  <br>  Vermiculite is a naturally occurring, mica mineral similar to Perlite. Again, it has excellent water retention and drainage properties. Its advantage over Perlite is that it is a more pleasant colour though Vermiculite tends to contain quite a lot of small particles; around 1/4 of a typical bag can be lost after sifting out fines.<br>   <br>  Sifting out 'Fines':<br>  <br>  For a good soil structure that drains well, all soils whether organic or inorganic, must be sifted to remove dust and very small particles. Soil particles smaller than 2mm should always be removed. Dust that remains in the soil mixture clogs the open structure of the soil and disrupts the drainage of excess water.<br>   <br>  Switching From Organic to Inorganic Soils<br>  <br>  Almost all deciduous varieties will tolerate the transition from organic to inorganic soils as long as they are healthy; coniferous species, in particular Pines, benefit from the retention of some of their old soil which will contain mycorrhiza fungi necessary for growth. If in doubt, make the transition slowly increasing the amount of inorganic material at each repotting. <br>  <br>  The Best Soil Mix for Bonsai<br>  <br>  There is no single soil mix that is best for cultivating bonsai; variables such as local climate and rainfall, personal watering regimes and individual tree species all contribute to variations in enthusiasts' soil mixes. Ultimately, experience of using different soil types and ingredients will shape your own particular preferences. It is recommended that in the first instance, find out the soil-mix of local enthusiasts who have found a successful mix and take it from there. I would however recommend the use of inorganic soils and not organic as they are nearly always of a better quality.<br>  <br>  30% Seramis clay granules, 40% Vermiculite and 30% Grit. <br>  For additional water retention I increase the volume of Vermiculite at the expense of grit and Seramis, for a very free draining mix the volume of Grit is increased to 50%. My experience of this mix is that even in the height of summer, watering is necessary no more than once or twice a day though excess water is allowed to run straight through drainage holes of the pot. I have yet to experience any drainage or compaction problems, nor have I had any trees suffer with root-rot. Lastly, all these materials are readily available at all good garden-centers at a reasonable cost.|`|4be53bee43d92cb66f2928030bec3a17aa	It really depends on what you are trying to grow as a bonsai.  You would want to duplicate the soil requirements of the normal size plant.<br>  <br>  But in general, you are going to want a soil that drains well.  You could probably start with any planting mix.  You will have to make sure that you give the plant a light feeding every so often.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!

(not sure if I spelled that right???)   <br>  It's an antiseptic & it's full of alcohol so it kills all the germs!<br>  Plus it's okay to get into your mouth...just don't swallow it.|`|LxPepgfjaa	Bleach and rinse well after|`|0e4387b2094405dfc19dbc597cf0998aaa	soak it in sterilizing tablet .
3ytr2wssaa	it does not matter which world its only one world when they have sex|`|P9XxUAjhaa	What exactly is the question here???
P9XxUAjhaa	I might call the health department.  Although, if you are a home owner, this could get you locked out of your house if they find a harmful cause you will have to leave until you fix it.|`|PCYIgzG5aa	First check the containers of any type of cleaners, paint, adhesives, wood stains, lubricant, oil, fertilizer and whatnot that you've got stored in your basement (I recently found muratic acid had burned through it's bottle and was dripping onto the floor).  <br>  <br>  If that's not it, call the gas company, even if you don't have gas service.  The smell that is added to natural gas smells different to each person.  To me it smells like cleanser to another person rotten eggs.  It's possible that you've got a leak somewhere that is barely perceptible to others.  (We had a gas leak that the gas company came out to investigate twice and they couldn't find it, but the Sears appliance repair man did.  It was the flexible hose to my dryer.)<br>  <br>  Oh, check any insulation around your water heater too.  When it gets singed it sometimes emits a chemical smell.
LZsFfVnZaa	after or during college get a phone book or go on the internet and look for design firms or independant designers in your area. check out a few and ask about internships. Internships are a good way for you to learn the real life stuff you dont learn in school and a lot of the time people hire their interns or help them find jobs when their internships are done|`|CzsMRTNwaa	After college, watch the channel called "Lifestyle Network". Watch the shows like "At Home With", "Merge", "Outer Spaces", etc.
ltiEixnqaa	In very general terms, granual fertilizers will have a greater chance of casuing burn at label rate compared to liquids. But is not always the care. Fertilizers cause burn because many are salts, and salts draw water out of plants resulting in burn.<br>  <br>  Most liquid fertilizers are salts, but the recommended rates are supply relatively low rates of nitrogen. They are short lived, give quick results and are more expensive than granualr fertilizers.. <br>  <br>  Using a slow release fertilizer (IBDU, Woodace, Blue Chip, ect) or an organic based granular is much less likly to cause burn compared to a fast release granular. These last longer than liquid and are typically a better value.<br>  <br>  Most inexpensive granular fertilizers are fast release, and caution must be used during high temps.<br>  <br>  For a golf green in the summer, many greenskeepers prefer using a grandular orgainic product called milorganite. It is slowly released by microbial action.  It is very safe and lasts a long time. It also contains iron which give your grass good color. I have have double the rates on milorganite and have not had any burn issues.|`|6bZCNyLwaa	Most synthetic fertilizers run the risk of burning your turfgrass.  If you try an organic fertilizer, you can apply it at any time with no risks.  If you want to go with synthetics, follow the label directions exactly, and apply it at the time of day it specifies.  If the label doesn't specify, do it in the early, early morning, then water.  Your grass is more open to accepting fertilizer in the early morning hours.  Good luck!|`|zpQRHx4Gaa	If used at label rates neithe should "burn" your grass. Although I find granular type fertilizers can be applied more evenly.(what I mean is:)Did you squirt or pour more of the soluble on area A as compared to area B? See what I mean? A granular applied correctly with a spreader eliminates this dilemma. Just remember most grasses will go dormant(go to sleep) in hte summer heat.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  streetlighter1
