She can take Midol or something, that helps. If its that bad, her mom should take her to the doctor just to be safe.|`|5EfJu34taa	tell her to take paracetamol per day once or twice.it will relieve the pain|`|N3hwwTKVaa	I always had really bad period pains too. I'd have to take a day or two off school sometimes. <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is be sympathetic, encourage her to lie down or take painkillers if she needs to, and bear in mind that she may not be feeling her best self and so don't react if she's a bit cranky. It's just nice for her to know that someone's there for her and takes her pain seriously, as often people who don't get bad cramps don't understand what it's like.<br>  <br>  If she wants to, I would seriously suggest that she goes to her GP to ask for the pill as it did wonders for my period pains. I used to have a terrible array of symptoms and now they have all but disappeared.|`|wwwiWaK8aa	How old is she? She should consult her doctor about going on the pill. It regulates hormones and eases period pains and heavy flows. Taking pain killers will thin her blood, please don't let her take too many of them as her body will become used to it in the long run.<br>  <br>  If she isn't open to going on the pill , there are other hormone drugs that work like the pill that also help with this.<br>  <br>  She can also try being more active. Physical exercise helps a lot.|`|bxBCzoCoaa	Don't be to worried. It might be a cyst which is not a very serious condition. Most go away some get surgically removed. Tylenol menstrul pills are AMAZING|`|gU5S203vaa	it diff rent for every buddy  because some people get pain every day|`|pvrZUDD0aa	Go to the doctor.  They can give her stronger pain killers on prescription for free, which will work a whole lot better than normal painkillers.  I don't suggest that she goes for the pill, unless the painkillers the doctor prescribes don't work, but if she is still relatively young she really should talk it over with her parents before she does anything - I'm sure her parents wouldn't be thrilled if they found out she was on the pill secretly!

But it can also differ from clothing company to company.<br>  <br>  You can be 7stone and a size 10 and you can also be 10stone and a size 10.<br>  <br>  Its about maintaining a healthy weight :)|`|xqQO81Omaa	It's not about weight, but your measurements. If you are wide on the hips for example, you might be a size 10 trousers at a lower weight than someone who has narrow hips. It's to do with the way the weight is distributed.<br>  <br>  Everyone carries their weight differently. Two people can even be the same height and clothes size and still look totally different due to their body shape, i.e. hourglass verus boyish figure.|`|3qLIRorjaa	How tall are you?<br>  <br>  I'm 5ft7 and was 8.5 stone and a size 10. (bit bigger now, mind)|`|DVX8UVKOaa	It depends on how tall you are. I weigh just under 9 and 1/2 stone and I am a size 1.2. I'm only 5ft3. If I was a couple of inches taller at the same weight I wuld probably be a size ten. Looking at it the other way round, when I was 9 stone, I was a size 10. It also depends where you carry weight (i.e on your bottom or waist etc). Muscle weighs more than fat so someone could be the same height as you but weigh more and be in a smaller clothes size because they are toned and muscular|`|aXnVFFUkaa	it would depend greatly on your height and a lot of celebs are airbrushed so they look thinner anyway|`|epBOAXUraa	look - you need to stop focusing on dress sizes.

73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	Plaque turns into tartar, both of which can be removed. If it goes down below the gumline they may have to do a "deep cleaning" - basically scraping it off below the gumline - and that costs a chunk.  If your dentist gets most of it off during the cleaning, then keeping good hygiene afterwards, such as you are doing, should help it go back to normal and keep it from progressing.  I'm not sure exactly how long it takes to turn into tartar, but you shouldn't have to worry about it if you are flossing and brushing.  Flossing at least twice a week is better than not flossing at all - just remember to do it at least that much if not everyday.|`|64515c9dd3f1d42fce2093056b18e17aaa	tartar can be scraped. plaque is permanent. <br>  <br>  keep brushing. the sensitivity will go away.|`|EZhtxWs9aa	im supposed 2 have on of the top dentists in the country and mine were like yours at one point. if you brush them in the morning after Tea then the night about 1 weeks to 2 weeks you're gums will me light pink and they will be perfect for your next checkup

MATiTs5Oaa	Yoghurt and kefir are not normal dairy. They are fermented. The sugar levels are reduced. They contain many yeasts good for health .<br>  <br>  Kefir grains are a combination of bacteria and yeasts in a matrix of proteins, lipids, and sugars. Today, kefir is becoming increasingly popular due to new research into its health benefits. Many different bacteria and yeasts are found in the kefir grains, which are a complex and highly variable community of micro-organisms.For instance, kefir over-ripened (which increases the sour taste) significantly increases folic acid content.Kefir also aids in lactose digestion as a catalyst, making it more suitable than other dairy products for those who are lactose intolerant.The kefiran in kefir has been shown to suppress an increase in blood pressure and reduce serum cholesterol levels in rats.<br>  <br>  I live somewhere Middle East- here Kefir and also yoghurt are considered semi medicines. They are natural antibiotics, kill the germs, make you strong, make your intestines healthy. Even most people with milk intolerance can consume them, because there is no lactose.<br>  <br>  But, even so, I've never heard of its being good for skin problems.<br>  <br>  ED?t<br>  Here is what I found from www.acne.org<br>  <br>  Kefir's ample supply of phosphorus, the second most abundant mineral in our bodies, helps utilize carbohydrates, fats, and proteins for cell growth, maintenance and energy. <br>  <br>  Kefir is rich in Vitamin B12, B1, and Vitamin K. It is an excellent source of biotin, a B Vitamin which aids the body's assimilation of other B Vitamins, such as folic acid, pantothenic acid, and B12. The numerous benefits of maintaining adequate B vitamin intake range from regulation of the kidneys, liver and nervous system to helping relieve skin disorders, boost energy and promote longevity<br>  <br>  <br>  Also read this link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kefir.biz/benefit.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kefir.biz/benefit.htm</a><br>  <br>  They claim that it reduces acne.

However, you can make coconut kefir that is extrememly healthful and pretty tasty.
SsXNL74Aaa	you have probally conditioned yourself to the alarm. the fact you have a alarm suggests that your not a morning person otherwise you wont need it! the fact that you "feel funny" is the conditioning taking place. what im saying is that you dont like getting up, and when you hear the same noice you are feeling like you have to get up. this causes anxiety as your body feels like you need to get up, but you are already up ... yeah change the alarm.|`|MI7Vo2d5aa	silly.

Both my husband and I carry organ donor card's and my 13 year old daughter has told us she would like to donate her organs if anything happened to her. As I worked in Intensive Care when I was nursing I came into contact with people who had made this choice with there family and saw the comfort some people derived from knowing that there loved ones death brought some good to other people. I also remember one family when asked about the possibility of donating their loved ones organs who said no, a couple of hours later they came back and said they had discussed it and changed their minds, unfortunately by then it was to late to do anything about it. So you need to let your family know if you do decide that you would like to be an organ donor.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	In Florida they have it on our driver's license..

BG8vMyZjaa	Anxiety can cause many physical symptoms, the 3 mile bike ride and the loss of your friend would make anyone feel fragile and anxious.<br>  If the symptoms persist do see your doctor.  Meanwhile have a warm drink and a light meal and I think you will bve ok.|`|BCgt7oaKaa	I would think that after riding 3 miles after not doing any physical exercise could make one feel shaky and faint, but not typically a day later. If the diarrhea is serious enough, you could feel that way due to dehydration. Even if you've had 3-4 movements in a day, if you don't replace the loss with the proper nutrients, you sure could feel pretty lousy afterwards. as for the cause of diarrhea, it could possibly be stress induced IBS, caused by the anxiety of your friend. Try drinking some gatorade or something of the sort to help with the diarrhea, and eat bland foods for a day until the diarrhea subsides. Hope you get better soon!
AA11091145	I think you have a good chance for it to blend back to normal.  I got lots of 2nd degree burns while working in a foundry and all them eventually healed, but it takes several months.  My worst on my ankle took two years for the pigmentation to look normal.
73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	You can have braces (obviously) for the most "natural" looking fix, or veneers - they have to shave down your teeth to nubs for that & then cap over them though, so that's not my favorite option.  I just don't see the point of ruining good teeth for the sake of aesthetics.  I'm 45 and have been considering braces for many years...I'm thinking of finally taking the plunge this year, but wish I had done it when I was younger when the teeth were more "willing" to move.

73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	Not necessarily.  If the cavity is down to the nerve, then yes - you'll need a root canal.  Get into the dentist before it gets to that point - you're talking a jump in price of about $1,000. or more if you need a crown.
Sh7r0kNuaa	phentermine is speed. the high is not pleasant. trust me. it feels like you are having an anxiety attack for hours.|`|VFhE8nBxaa	Any weight loss pill could get you "high" overly rapid feel from taking them. Simple explanation weight loss pills tend to be compared to speed. Expecially this pill inparticular, when a person is drug tested on this pill the drug screen will come back as - speed  & ( amphetamines ) . <br>  <br>  Phentermine is a stimulant that is similar to an amphetamine. Phentermine is an appetite suppressant that affects the central nervous system.<br>  <br>  Phentermine is used togther with diet and exercise to treat obesity (overweight) in people with risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes.<br>  <br>  Phentermine may also be used for purposes other than those listed in this medication guide.<br>  <br>  <br>  Phentermine may be habit-forming and should be used only by the person it was prescribed for. Keep track of how many pills have been used from each new bottle of this medicine. Phentermine is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if any person in the household is using this medicine improperly or without a prescription.<br>  <br>  Symptoms of a phentermine overdose may include confusion, hallucinations, feeling restless or aggressive, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, irregular heartbeat, tremors, rapid breathing, confusion, hallucinations, feeling light-headed, fainting, or seizure (convulsions).

Hq6nSl1Qaa	The lump on the right side of your neck next to your corrotid artery is likely a lymph node.  During any strong immune response, B-cells present in the lymph node meet, share antigens, and proliferate.  When they are swollen and tender, that means that they are proliferating very rapidly and the node is literally busting at the seems with angry immune cells looking for a fight.<br>  <br>  You have to be very very very careful.  The fact that your lymph node did that means that you'll have a lot more B-cells ready to go insane the next time they see a nut protein.  Than means the risk of anaphylactic shock is much higher now.  You should consider having a stash of Benadryl every where you go.  Two pills at the onset of symptoms can give you enough time to seek medical attention before your breathing seizes.  You may also want to consider an epi-pen in your future.  This can get to the point where simply being on an airplane with enough people eating peanuts can cause you to go into shock.|`|4VHmppJWaa	i have no idea but you should see a doctor. and avoid things that say may contain nuts!

Hair growth, thickness, and color are all genetic traits, and it grows from under the skin. Do you expect, upon cutting the hair on your head, that it'll grow back thicker and a different color? <br>  If this were the case, balding men could just shave their head and grow back a full, bushy mane of hair.<br>  <br>  The reason people say that is because when you shave and it grows back, the point of the hair is sharp because of the razorblade so it feels nastier. When you have hair on your arms or something that you don't shave, it feels soft because the tips of the hair are rubbing against clothing and stuff and dulling down.|`|178658a99180d9bd2ee1a21505c0ec00aa	It's a bad idea to shave anything that you aren't willing to send the rest of your life shaving.

You also shaved "fuzz" that will  probably lead to more hairs that need to be shaved on a regular basis. <br>  <br>  Next time, go for laser removal or one of the other removal options.

AA12197237	Addiction is a strange thing, it sometimes won't show until you try to stop. Just try swearing off something for a week, it's harder than you think. By common definition, addiction doesn't start until one relies on it for normal functioning, or in other words, I'm addicted to anything I can't live without. Like food, water, and clothes. It's not a very definite definition I'm sure, but you're not addicted...yet.<br>  <br>  The reason it's on your mind is probably because you were disobeying your mother and you don't like it on a subconscious level.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would stop now.

With all the evidence of the health problems it causes then it takes a pretty stupid person to start what ever you have going on at the moment. Smoking is not the answer. Please believe me I have seen so much suffering from people who thought that they were not addicted to cigarettes until it was to late and they could not stop. Part of the reason you may be thinking about them is you know you should not be smoking and you know it will upset your mum, my advice is to find something else that will not endanger your life to give the same sort of kick|`|sw2R5A9iaa	your reaction is known as a psychological addiction.  this is the easy one to treat -modify your behavior by finding a more positive substitute.

The reason she may be having pain in her lower back is because of the high dosage of advil. If she would read on the bottle that it may cause liver and kidney damage.

7xc8jgLXaa	i like this question.<br>  It's kind of philosophical so I'll answer it =)<br>  <br>  I think this stems out of people not wanting other people to know/think about sex outside of marriage. I also think this stems out of seeing sex *only* as procreation and in no way as a form of recreation.<br>  <br>  Thus missionary position would be "ok" because that would be the safe generic way for humans to create a baby. But other crazy freaky positions show sex as "recreational" and, thus "impure"<br>  <br>  I also think that because humans are such sexual beings that of course it's foremost on people's minds. This would explain why "The Pill" refers to birth control and not, say, Tylenol or something lol<br>  <br>  Thanks for your question....I like it|`|4vkhb5bxaa	An impure thought can be any sexual activity between two persons who are not married to each other.

A BMI calculator will tell you that you are in a healthy range (20.3) if you use the adult one, but many muscular people weigh more than what is considered healthy because muscle weighs more than fat. It sounds like you are fine though. Just eat right, and get a good amount of exercise. These habits will help you throughout life.

Since your just starting out, its important not to push yourself too hard, too fast. I would keep doing what your doing for at least a couple weeks (3 or 4 times per week). Then, if you think you can handle more, slowly increase your sessions. For example, if you are jogging continuously for 15 minutes now, in 2 weeks time, add another 2-3 minutes to this... Or you could try interval training. For this, you would jog 5-7 minutes, decrease your pace to a very slow jog or a fast walk for 1-2 minutes and then increase speed again for 5 more minutes... continual switching between paces for 45 minutes to an hour. this will help you to improve on your endurance. Whatever way you do it, make sure you aren't over exerting yourself.

I would recommend 3 days a week for 20 minutes at first but make sure you work in some core strengthening excersize too. to have an effective workout you need to keep your heart rate up for at least 20 minutes. Once you start to adjust to that just increase the length and frequency of your workouts as needed. look into different types of crosstraining such as biking or swimming so you're not just running all the time. good luck!|`|2Yp4fMqJaa	You should get your heart rate up for about 20 minutes at least 4 or 5 times a week.

If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.

B-12 is mostly good for energy.

mLqJYrFGaa	i don't think so, i don't support willingly starving yourself.|`|4lqwMnhJaa	1. Your body has it's own system of flushing toxins out of your body. Unless you eat extremely high processed foods with a lot of high glucose syrup, your body is fine by itself.<br>  <br>  2. Going cold turkey is not good on addictions. You will probably break and eat 50 brownies or something. Try just limiting how much you have in a day, like one cookie. Buy seven cookies at the store and don't allow yourself to go to the store until a week is up. Or something else that you like.<br>  <br>  3. Sure, you'll lose weight (I know you told me not to give you crap but sorry) but you'll just gain it back very quickly. You're just PLANNING to to make a huge change and lead a very healthy lifestyle, and I bet you will try, but it's a lot easier to say that to do.<br>  <br>  4. Drinking just water for 2 weeks is not good for your body. People do go on water fasts for a while, but they take EXTREMELY good care of their bodies afterwards.  They don't exercise too much because their bones are weak, and they take extreme care of easing back into food.<br>  <br>  5. Assuming you don't collapse and have to go to the hospital, you will probably lose about 10 pounds. Losing 10 pounds in 2 weeks is never healthy. Ever. Stop trying to cheat and just eat healthier. Do you really think starving yourself is the healthy and right way to lose weight? Just run two miles every day.|`|44qG7oUdaa	i found the information here

Unfortunatly there is nothing to predict where or if you will get an out break.<br>  I contracted oral herpes on my genitals after my boy friend gave me oral sex with a healing cold sore. I also have HSV1 on my mouth. <br>  Many people can have cold sores or genital herpes and never show symptoms of it. <br>  You could have gotten them when you were a child from a relative or friend giving you a kiss on the cheek when they had an out break of cold sores and don't know any better.

And, the transmission of genital herpes occurs a lot through oral sex.  It's too bad he didn't tell you, or he may have not known that he could infect you this way.  Many people don't.<br>  <br>  If you tested positive for HSV-1, that does not necessarily mean that you have genital herpes.  It sounds like (from your description) that you have not had a break out on your genitals.  Many people, like 90% of us, will test positive for HSV-1 by adulthood (but mostly on our mouths).<br>  <br>  But, because you may have antibodies for HSV-1 already, does NOT mean that you can't contract HSV-1 or HSV-2 on your genitals.  <br>  <br>  Wait and see if you have a break out.

k8n05Wk5aa	the contents of the IV are designed to help you relax. as the fluid reacts with chemicals in your brain and you start to relax you pass through the transition stage in which you may relax to the point where you are 'slap happy' like late at night when you laugh at anything. it is natural.|`|YS84yYXUaa	i have been under anesthesia 5 times and each time the effects were different but not one of them was laughing. one time i woke up hallucinating. one time i woke up to myself screaming about wanting to see theresa. which i don't know anyone named theresa. that was really weird and then the other times i just woke up like from sleeping. i'm sure everyone is different and the circumstances as to why your going under(stress levels) have everything to do with your reaction.|`|gNUwLLTjaa	anesthesia is crazyy(:<br>  it can make you laugh, when my grandma was like high on it in the hospital from breaking her hip, you should have seen her hahha, then you wouldn't be asking this question<br>  but yes, it can definetally makee you crackk up|`|wZHBtqCuaa	It makes you laugh because when under its influence, you lose control over your actions.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	everyone has a different reaction to anesthesia.  inform your doctor of the reaction if you have surgery in the future.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	That's not a "normal" reaction. Obviously it's not a bad side effect. Anesthesia does, for that moment, lower your inhibition so you must have thought of something funny at just that moment. <br>  Nitrous oxide was dubbed the "laughing gas" when dentists used it years ago. It was for the same reason and the reason some kids use it to get high. I think enough of them died from overdose so it's kinda gone out of favor.<br>  But to answer your question, no there is nothing intrinsic about any anesthesia that would make you laugh.
h6cAhPs6aa	sure sounds like  it to me.  even if you had a helmet on you can still jar your head and neck.  i would see your doctor and just have him have a look at you.  he will probably take some x-rays.  i wouldn't wait to long before you go to the doctor. not with head and neck pain. you don't fool around with head and neck injuries|`|dBEgYeHQaa	CHances are you have..Better safe than sorry sweetie, please go to the emergency room|`|UJHKyg7kaa	Yes, I bet you do have a slight concussion, probably not bad, but you should still get it checked out by the doctor just to make sure there is no internal bleeding.

They took him to the ER that night and he had a concussion!<br>  <br>  So def get checked out!|`|69OqzzBpaa	You may have a concussion. A good way to tell if you have is to look in the mirror and if your pupils are dilated or uneven in size it is very possible that you have a concussion. if this is your first concussion it is not serious but if you truly have one then that means you are susceptible to getting another. You probably should go to the doctors and they will give you medicine for it

TQCSwCpQaa	I think that you mean "palpitations", but if this relationship is only working in one direction, what's the point?

Remember, "Life's not a dress rehearsal."|`|ZjhQ6PL8aa	Palpitations are caused by many things some unknown.

44fe68ac48e4256fe9ab6ffbd1ee8375aa	You can't feel the pain while they are applying the braces... I didn't notice until I closed my mouth and they told me they were done! It will hurt for the next three days after that though, so take advil whenever you need it. You will get used to it though and everything will feel normal again. As for your singing voice, after I got my braces put on, I talked with a slight lisp for the first day or two. It went away after that but on the fourth day I got a top and bottom retainer cemented in. If you have a tongue thrust, or a really bad bite and you require any kind of non-removable retainer, you will not talk the same. I had a tongue thrust and they put a metal bar in your mouth to keep your tongue from coming forward, and 6 months later, I still have the biggest lisp ever. Chances are, you wont have all of the crap I have in my mouth put into your mouth all at once... I had some bad bite problems! You'll be fine, give it a week.|`|VlmRTuhgaa	Well, Freddy Mercury (lead singer of Queen) would not get his jaw fixed because he thought it would ruin his singing voice. But that was his jaw, not his teeth. I don't think braces will affect your singing. I talk the same as I always have since I've gotten braces. I kid I know got braces and developed a major lispe. BUT! It only lasted like two-three days, after a couple days he was speaking normal like he normally was before he got braces :)<br>  <br>  I think you're going to be okay for singing :)|`|kSZstQ6Paa	i think it will hurt but even if you can`t sing good with braces, to me and maybe my freinds you will sing like the way you use too|`|mgNID0gIaa	I think you would be okay because braces don't affect your singing. You do get sore after you get them so don't sing RIGHT after but, I think you would be okay!
AA12240972	Yeah maybe not so much the cycling, that will build large leg muscles.  My son cycled for years.  What I think you are meaning to say is you don't want bulk.

a961b1c12764a39cd7c451fb25caa829aa	yes it sounds like you may have depression.  some of the things mentioned can be normal such as tyring to figure life out but you shouldnt be thinking about death excessivley. I would see a therapist and try and feel better!  It sounds like you are a very deep thinker though and there is nothing wrong with that.|`|FG75AjcRaa	some (if not MOST!) of those things are true about me and i dont have depression|`|flaOQzZoaa	Hi, I'm an Emotional Health therapist so I hope I can give you some really good advice. <br>  <br>  Firstly, yes it absolutely does sound like you have depression, but also some emotional issues that would really help to be resolved. And also quite a lot of stress.<br>  <br>  The therapy I use mostly is EFT - I really think it could help you. (and I dont want you to think I'm doing a sales pitch here - you can download a how to manual for free on the official website which you could use immediately on your feelings of sadness. It works very quickly) www.emofree.com - also if you go to resources section and click on case studies you can read thousands of case studies of EFT successfully treating depression.<br>  <br>  To be honest I would tell most people to get the manual and use it for themselves but I think yours would be too difficult - however try it and see how you get on - you could work on sooo many things but I think to totally remove depression and the feelings accompanying it some psychological aspects would have to come into play as well. Try it anyway and see - you can always find an EFT therapist to help you - or you can contact me for help.<br>  <br>  The good news is that EFT is the fastest most effective therapy available at the moment - unlike talk therapies it will actually remove negative emotional responses permanantly - so you are very unlikely to find the depression re-occur.<br>  <br>  Admittedly the process looks a bit weird at first, it doesn't matter if you laugh, but it is important that you're specific.<br>  <br>  Here is my website - contact me if you need help. There are also good video clips of EFT in action and lots of info which will help if you are going at it alone. www.thelife-clinic.com<br>  <br>  Good luck, Kelly.|`|2ZGEqEJXaa	See a therapist ASAP! Just knowing whether it is depression or not won't help. You need treatment.|`|81795f6f3a94b68b76772b69ce36918faa	:( you make me sad<br>  it does sound like u have depression.

It has a slightly higher fatality rate and slightly higher contamination rate than the regular influenza virus that most people have experienced once or twice, therefore the world, government and news/media have dragged this slightly out of proportion.<br>  Most deaths have been reported in Mexico - where it is very hard for Mexican doctors to even diagnose the disease, let alone attempt to cure it. Therefore deaths through flu-like symptoms, or even regular flu, have all been put down to "swine flu".<br>  <br>  Swine flu broke out in 1974 (i think) and had a bit of a pandemic then. However, the strain had a vaccine against it, and i'm sure this strain will have a vaccine too.<br>  <br>  By everyone panicing, makes the situation a lot worse.<br>  <br>  There is no outright cure, however, by resting and taking the usual precautions you do when you have flu, and also the medication Oseltamivir, that most people know as the brand name "Tamiflu" has almost certainly proved to rid the disease in every case.<br>  <br>  Stop worrying! :)|`|Cy7ayY56aa	Well ****, I sure hope not because then we all won't get to read the media coverage and the posts on Yahoo Answers about the world ending in 12//21/2012.

That freaked you out because you've been programmed with the myth that you're supposed to be hard all the time, so your worry made it difficult to get hard again.  Instead try to concentrate on the parts of your girl, or the parts of the situation, that turn you on, and your erection will return in time.|`|3zxVzPBxaa	how old are you?<br>  <br>  cause I used to be friends with this guy who would go soft on his girlfriend all of the time, he just couldnt help it... and two years later he said that he realized he was gay... and now he gives it to guys.<br>  <br>  lol no offense.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	you are not turned on by her enough to keep you hard<br>  <br>  try viagara if she does turn you on and you are still soft and also see a doctor if this is the case|`|OXxKTM6vaa	If its very big it may have problems getting hard for this reason, see you're GP.|`|RWFAweUGaa	You may have ED.

13k2WKx8aa	He has the flu. Or at least it sounds like the flu.<br>  <br>  While 102 is high, it's not "HOLY SH*T" high at all. It's the "stay at home" high. If it hits 103.5 or 104, then bring him to the hospital.<br>  <br>  For now, make sure he's drinking plenty of fluids. Water is best. Gatorade if he can stomach it. If not, at some point sneak just a pinch of salt into his water if he's not eating anything.<br>  <br>  Honey tea can work wonders.<br>  <br>  If he wants to take something, NyQuil will help him sleep. For now, have him take a couple of extra strength Motrin. He should be fine. Wait until four hours has passed since you gave him the Tylenol before you give him Motrin. Also, make sure he has a little something in his stomach before taking Motrin. He could get a nasty stomach ache if he doesn't.<br>  <br>  He feels like he's going to throw up because he probably is going to at some point. That's part of the deal. Just make sure nothing goes down the food hole for at least half an hour after he pops.<br>  <br>  Rest and relaxation is in order unless that fever gets higher. Usually in the late afternoon / evening is when people tend to feel worse. NyQuil will help him sleep well tonight. Get the liquid stuff. The Green Death. It tastes like evil, but it works well. He should feel a bit better tomorrow or the day after.|`|AA12247459	Go to the ER.|`|b45bac50fccd45d17e57213773d0a20faa	Give him Motrin...tell him to go to the doctor he probably has a throat infection.

eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	If it just looks like teary eyes, then combined with the runny nose and sneezing- yes it could be an allergic response to something in the environment.  Given her age, the best idea would be to have her looked at by the pediatrician.  In the meantime, you might want to get an allergen reducing spray to hose down stuff in the house, plus get the heater filter cleaned or replaced.  This is the time of year for household irritants to peak, after months of a shut up house, and pending spring spore numbers.  Any one of those things can set off the learner immune system of a toddler- and cause the things you mention.

Ice is a miracle worker.|`|ZTlD1adpaa	A sprain can sometimes be a little worse than an actual break - the doctor is right, take some time out, keep it elevated and make sure you have pain relief - but if it is still giving you trouble after a few weeks i would recommend going back to you doctor and seeing if you culd get an appointment with a physio - i had to do this after i badly sprained my ankle and after a few weeks of physio it has never troubled me since!|`|69OqzzBpaa	You are just going to have to wait it out. when i broke my ankle, it was swollen for 2 months. if it is a bad sprain then it could take a couple of weeks to heal. just keep it elevated and if you are having pain take advil or ibuprofen|`|4S6V4sb4aa	A sprain has to do with the tendons in your ankle.. they have to heal for you to feel better,, and if you don't take it easy you will have pain in it for the fest of your life due to arthritis..I know it happened to me..|`|h6cAhPs6aa	sometimes the hospitals can't see to much when the ankle is so swollen, but it does take sometime for the ankle to feel better. what i did was i got some bengay i put it on my ankle and wrapped a hot towel around my ankle and that really helped,  i did it four times a day and within 2 to 3 days it felt a lot better. but if you still don't feel comfortable with it,  i would go and see your doctor.

tsdLrJORaa	They don't. It's a myth.<br>  Right now in the porn world, big black penises with white women is very popular, but it's not because there aren't white ones just as big. For whatever reason, the porn-viewing public just doesn't want to watch white-on-white action as much. Probably the interracial "taboo" is the turn-on.<br>  On the other hand, big white ones are prevalent in gay porn.<br>  Another place to see some huge white penises is bigcocksociety.com.   They run a contest every month.|`|FVDbVcnCaa	That's a stereotype. Some black guys have small packages, while some white guys have large ones.

gvMoIhn2aa	well im 13 and im 5'6'',you dont stop growing till your 18,so dont worry height will catch up :D|`|8Xbc4ok1aa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain.

L0hRcrwMaa	There's a lot of hype on the new swine flu. You should be concerned by being more cautious of what you touch or who you're around but the chances of you catching it are still very slim. If you're really worried about coming in contact with it start working on building your immune system. Take probiotics, they're great at fighting off parasites. Also, take a good multi vitamin. Not the ones from Wal-Mart! Go to your local vitamin store. More immune boosters are vitamin c, echinacea, and some obvious ones, local fruits and vegetables. Unfortunately during this time I would stay away from foods that come from Mexico, Ecuador, and other foreign countries.Plus drink lots of bottled reverse osmosis water.

eQCsKq4jaa	Sorry to say it but you are going down a dangerous path. <br>  <br>  You do sound like you are an alcoholic. Most people do know know what an alcoholic really is (compared to a heavy drinker). <br>  <br>  Since the alcohol is already impacting your life yet you still drink is the biggest indicator of alcoholism. And the "I just want to be buzzed all the time" statement is also indicative of alcoholism. <br>  <br>  I would get some help and there is a lot more than just AA (but AA might be a place to start and they have groups for teens). <br>  <br>  You said "mum" so if you are British The NHS has really good options for people with a drinking problem (I would go there first). <br>  <br>  And  see a medical doctor. There are even some medications (they are typically expensive) to help cravings. Disulfiram (Antabus) is also an option. Talk to a doctor even if you are not going to take medications.<br>  <br>  From what you said it is hard to tell just how bad things are (and how much help you would need) but one thing is certain, if you continue this pattern it will only get worse. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|eMSP740Taa	You are DEFINITELY going down a horribly dangerous path.

I really wish I wouldn't have bought them.  The hole concept of butt floss is gross to me.  Thongs are gross anyways because they are germy and can lead to different kinds of female infections.  The only reason I bought them is because a pair of dress slacks I have for work that are a thinner material so you can see regular pantie lines.  I tried on a thong and it was the most uncomfortable thing, but boy shorts fix the problem just the same plus they are super cute!  Now my favorite kind of underwear is the boy shorts or booty shorts.  Plus my boyfriend thinks thongs scream SLUT! and are tacky, which I would have to agree.|`|hOEIFpl5aa	0% i wear just like underwear. normal underwear
qiLKlSmHaa	There is no test for appendicitis, even at the doctors.  If it is appendicitis, after two weeks you'd be in pretty bad shape, if not dead by now from a burst.  Generally the pain lasts a while but then is accompanied by fever, vomiting, pain across the entire abdomen, as the condition gets worse and worse.  It takes days to progress to a very serious state, not weeks.  The constipation itself is maybe what is causing the pain...or something else may be irritating your insides.  You've waited this long, you'll be fine to wait anothe day.|`|g7uMKvEzaa	I disagree. there is a simple test Dr's can and do do about the reflexes of an area they push if you have it...I had it and my Dr. told me to go to the emergency room ASAP.. My husband took me and I was operated on in no time...If you had or have appendicitis you probably wouldn't be on the computer now...The pain is unbelievable you can't even talk hardly and surely not stand up ...At least that is how I was before I had mine out..It is on your right side..<br>  If you are afraid,,go get it checked out ,,they will be able to tell you at the emergency room .. They have ways to tell....You might just have the flu and that is rotten...But , go get it checked if you have doubts.

I will say that I had a similar problem and it turned out that I needed a bowel cleansing (poop). Also, make sure you're drinking enough water. Your kidneys could be trying to tell you something. But I'm not a doctor and by all means, get checked out. It could be something more serious.

SltEwVX7aa	you go into it with this single thought in your head:  Hey, I'm gonna get laid!  It's your goal, it's your quest.  Let no one get in your way.  <br>  <br>  Also, don't 'plan'.  Just let it happen.  Know what I mean?  Don't worry about making it happen;  just let it be.<br>  <br>  Now, you may shoot the instant you get in (many guys do), or you may get a few strokes in.  Or you may go the distance.  It doesn't matter.  The point is:  you're gonna get laid.|`|AA10350894	Don't think about it. I know that sounds odd, but don't think about making penetration, just let it happen. As you are kissing and petting, eventually you both will maneuver into position with out even thinking about it if you just let it happen.|`|aDBQncYuaa	Relax. That's the best advice you are going to get. Performance anxiety will ruin things for you every time unless you learn to be calm. It's just sex. The first time, it is pretty exciting. After a few years, it becomes routine (well, for some people anyway). Try to remember that it only gets easier, and the sooner you get past this issue, the sooner you can move on with doing it when/how/where you want.
lTNcvqyHaa	I would increase my physical exercise - this will increase your energy levels. Pop baby or child in the stroller and head out into the fresh air and sun.<br>  A good 30 min stroll or fast walk will improve your energy levels. And it is great thing to share with your child, they love to go out and you can talk and walk to your hearts content.<br>  <br>  Don't take anything to help you sleep - that will leave you doppy and drowsy all day.<br>  <br>  Before bed - grab a good slow read read book, that will calm the brain and get it ready for sleep - natural sleep.|`|1a500f4a1ff001d472b35d6b9566fe53aa	Do you take vitamins?

FVDbVcnCaa	A very broad question but i'll try my best. A very pleasing experience for both members involved. To be honest oral sex rocks. It's fun to get great oral and great to give oral and have them getting super turned on. Of course that all depends on how well your partner is at performing oral sex that is :) Negative things are sexually transmitted diseases of course. There are some STD's that your less likely to get from oral sex, but you STILL can get them. I just went over this in class today in my Human Sexuality class in college. Hope this helps!

If that guy is being suggestive towards you, like he is, he's most likely very unhappy in his relationship and it secretly wanting you.  So go for it and establish yourself as the dominant female that he's looking for. <br>  <br>  You have nothing to lose and a boyfriend to gain. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	Well, its not very nice of him to do that in front of his girlfriend. If he is interested in someone else, he should end his current relationship first, otherwise the same thing could happen to you. Sorry!|`|0MDBmKmMaa	Don't go any farther in to that 'relationship'.<br>  <br>  BAD BAD BAD IDEA!<br>  <br>  You could cause them two to break up.<br>  <br>  <br>  Not good, not good.
LwywrSRkaa	I did peer mentoring last year and teachers do have to do something about things like that. You're doing something that's harmful and that can put your life at risk. If they don't tell your parents they might help you out in some other way. Please do ask for help, your parents might not know right now by they could be informed by teachers because your hurting yourself. & I have to say if I knew that happened to someone that does ask a lot to be on someone's conscience. It will help talking about it to someone, someone that you can trust and that will listen to you. =) Really, just don't bottle it up because the way you want to take it out is by harming yourself. And even if you're parents find out, they surely will be by your side. I hope it all works out. =)|`|6wsGQ1NCaa	um it depends on what type of person he is. but im sure he will and he needs to because you're just doing wrong stuff.! dont do that|`|j7fzuDxgaa	i can see your not a happy person right now. i think your tutor was trying to reach out to you, but i feel he done it wrong he should be asking you about your feelings. talking about you as a person, because your not happy this may be the reason for your attitude. so if he or someone els can talk with you about your feelings you may be able to turn things a round and be happy again. i don't know if he will tell anyone as i don't know him. but i guess if he did not care he would not have come over.|`|ON84EQaBaa	baby idk if he'll tell your parents but you need to talk to  someone, you need help with dealing with what ever it is that you are going through. don't think that you're alone because there is a lot of people going through thing.yes scratching is a form of self harm, you need to get some help from somewhere if you're scratching today, you could become a cutter. please get yourself some help before things get worse,|`|a89kqsJaaa	it depends if he is a nice and unerstanding person or not if you can confide it him and you know that he wont get mad then tell him. I think that the best thing for you to do is to tell your PARENTS or a close FRIEND. you need to tell some one other wise you will get carried away and start doing something worse to you body than scratching your wrists. and yes i think that scratching does count as sel harming beacaues you are harming your own body and causing yourself pain. Just please tell somebody x
psXnI9d4aa	Having an over-active thyroid, known as hyperthyroidism, can lead to mood swings and irritability. The thyroid produces the hormone that controls your metabolism and when it produces to much of that hormone some of the symptoms are: losing weight even though you haven't changed your diet, having a fast heart beat or trouble breathing even when you are at rest, feeling weak in general, and mood swings, depression, and irritability.|`|K26ec4kLaa	Yes, among other symptoms.  Get to a doctor and have a TSH test run and he'll give you meds to make your thyroid more normal..|`|ho2hEqo8aa	Yes
k2IIZkA3aa	If it continues I'd definitely see a doctor about it. The most common knee problem associated with a popping sound and accompanied with pain is usually a meniscus tear or other ligament issue.<br>  <br>  If that is what is the problem, the treatment can range from resting the joint all the way to surgery in more severe/painful cases.|`|mY19PPlIaa	Well when I heard a pop in my knee. It was followed by slight swelling and pain and eventually I was not able to straighten out my leg, I had to keep it at a 80degree angle It was horrible. I went to the doctor and she thought it was an ACL injury but then I got an MRI and it turned out I had torn my meniscus (cartlidege in  your knee) and sprained a ligament in my knee. I had to go thru surgery and 3 wks of recovery followed by intensive physical therapy. I would suggest you go to your family doctor and ask for a referral to an orthopedic they are experts in this area family doctors really dont help at all. The orthopedic will more then likely order an MRI and then procede from there.|`|8te6mUHIaa	its probably just some excercises that made your leg that why .<br>  i got that too when i had gym the last few days and i went to the doctor.<br>  they said it wasnt anything but i think your knee is just like what mine happened|`|KjJFgBEIaa	I think what you need to do is maybe get it checked out, sounds like there might be something going on that doctor or someone could give you to help it but deff. get it checked... good luck
z4rmuK69aa	Hi i am podiatrist, I treat alot of people with poor circulation and other problems from smoking. 10 packs years is very little if you walk away now. By it self  it means nothing but one day you wake up and have 50plus years. That is bad. <br>  QUIT NOW<br>  If you have any other question contact me ay my new web site about the Morton's Toe  at www.whyyiureallyhurt.com|`|1YdeUn1Caa	My grandparents are 87 and 83 and have been smoking for over 60 years, with no signs of quitting. They are probably healthier than most non smokers in their 50's.|`|36a3ynpJaa	Depending on your age you can recover surprisingly well from smoking.  It takes about a year for most of the contamination to clear from your system and about two or three years for the organs to recover from smoking that much.  <br>  <br>  I knew a heavy smoker who had quit for about six months and he was still coughing up black goo from his lungs.  It was after he starting bringing up the black that he really committed to never smoking again.|`|PCsW0gbPaa	It is enough to cause irreversible damage.  If you've developed COPD or lung cancer, quitting now won't cure it.<br>  <br>  But as long as you haven't already developed one of those conditions, after you've quit for enough time your lung function returns to normal and risk of cancer etc drops to the same as for non-smokers.
jdah4ZA2aa	Hello.<br>  <br>  I've been a cutter for 13 years and it sucks.... I was sexually abused by a family member as a child and it made it very hard to trust people.  Not saying this is exactly what happened to her, but most cutters have been taught hard lessons by life. They need to control their emotions and/or bodies and have no ways to cope with stressful situations.  <br>  <br>  Don't draw attention to the cutting or the scars/marks.  It will make her defensive and afraid.  Most cutters are really afraid of intimacy (being close to someone) but really want it badly.  If she seems like she's unhappy, just ask her if she's bummed about something.  You've got to move slowly and build her trust.  If she sees she can talk to you about smaller things, you can gradually build towards bigger.  Share some experiences in which you felt scared or sad or powerless so she sees that you can understand her without judging her. <br>  <br>  I've never told even my best friends, but I wish I could.  But knowing that I have people I can tell even little things to helps so much.|`|uCtj31SNaa	you have to tell someone before she really hurts herself

uC75y83Taa	If you've been doing it your whole life, and you feel good, then it hasn't hurt you SO FAR.  Is there alcohol in it?  I hope not! We don't want you to be an alcoholic!  lol<br>  Before you drink it anymore, call a pharmacist. My gut feeling is that you should stop. Pharmacists are so smart and helpful.  A pharmacist will tell you the correct answer if it's OK to continue drinking it.  Please don't drink it until you've asked a pharmacist or doctor.  You can even call the phone number on the label.  They want to sell the stuff!  So if THEY tell you to stop drinking it, then you better stop.<br>  Seriously, it could be damaging your liver, which is irreversible.<br>  Take care, OK?  :)|`|ZbMLigR3aa	That would be pretty stupid to continue, as you can simply stop breathing by ingesting too much of anything containing benzocaine.

I would seriously get to a doctor if I were you, you are causing unknown amounts of damage to your body.|`|EoroQbCraa	it contains a local anesthetic, which has probably been hurting your liver you whole life.

vszOEaOZaa	i tried it before and it didn't work well for me.  i take vyvanse instead. the cost can vary from store to store. your best bet is to get online at walgreens or something like that and price it.  i believe different doses have different prices<br>  <br>  ADD: don't blame you. was exciting at first when i started losing weight but now i'm too skinny and flunked a drug test which made me realize how bad the meds are. but, i do much better on them than non stimulants.  i had to weigh my options. this link gives the most common meds prescribed by stim/non stim.  you can research prices.  i actually switched to medatate er a couple of weeks ago.  i have insurance but it's a high dedectible and this is a generic and is costs me $10/month full price.  for sure look into the generics.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/guide/adhd-medical-treatment" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/guide/adhd...</a>
dYGLyVpzaa	One girl did but it was a long time ago, and was due to complications from other areas of her health. I wouldn't be concerned - you wouldn't have been offered the jab if it was not safe. I've had two of the shots too, my third is due in April, and I'm glad I had the chance to take it. HPV can indeed be suppressed by your immune system but 70% to 90% of cervical cancers are caused by HPV, so its worth getting the jab in my opinion. You should have received a booklet before or after your first injection about side effects etc, if you didn't there is lots of info on the internet to take a look at. Hope this helps :)|`|AA10605419	Personally, I don't recommend the shot. I got all 3 series in 2006 at the age of 23 and I still have sign affects to this very day. My back aches and I constantly have pelvic pain. I have friends who have similar issues. I'm not trying to tell you what to do...just my personal experience. Also, I believe that it's just a marketing tool for the drug companies because 60% of women have that high risk strands that can cause cancer. I never even heard of HPV that much until this vaccine came out. Besides, the virus lies dormant anyways. I wish I didn't get it:(|`|t27SvIPbaa	Watch this video for why you shouldn’t take the vaccines.<br>  <a href="http://www.republicbroadcasting.org/index.php?cmd=videos.video&videoID=147" rel="nofollow">http://www.republicbroadcasting.org/inde...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.consciousmedianetwork.com/video/112408.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.consciousmedianetwork.com/vid...</a><br>  (What’s in a flu shot)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIjm9w_-tNY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIjm9w_-t...</a><br>  <br>  DON'T TAKE IT!! Or you may get cancer its mass genocide; the vaccine has mercury in it!! It’s the 2d most toxic substance on earth. More people get cancer that take the vaccines, than thoes who do not. In the UK they plan to give every teenage girl free vaccine to supposedly protect them from cervical cancer.   Independent scientific evidence shows that there IS no link between the HPV Papilloma virus and cancer, NO LINK!

Mercury is a deadly toxin and a baby's undeveloped brain has no resistance to the mercury. The same aply's to the flu jab and the Aids vaccine. The government need sick people because that the biggest money making racket after oil and war. More people make money out of cancer that those who die from it. Do your own research on the Internet, goggle dangerous vaccines or view them on you tube.<br>  <br>  WHY do people not ask what is in the vaccine??????????????? Before they put the shot in their body? Even doctors can’t tell what the ingredients are because they just accept what their told and give it to you. Go on ask what’s in it, you won’t get any answers!<br>  <br>  Parents of the gulf war solders asking what was in the vaccines that the army gave were told that that was classified information!!

3WcCeOqdaa	I currently have braces (since March 31, 2008) and expect to have them for 18-24 months (hoping for no longer than 20 months in total).  Others, though, have needed to wear them much longer - a girl I went to university with had them on for 5 years as an adult and recently got them off.  But her teeth are definitely straight now.<br>  <br>  I think I'll need a retainer too once the braces come off.  Mine are still a work in progress (being about 11 months right now).  You can contact me and I will send you my blog on my progress (not too terribly exciting but I just wanted to document how everything has gone so far).<br>  <br>  I think you need to keep them on longer - it won't hurt.<br>  <br>  My orthodontist has "filed" - they call it slenderizing - some of my teeth as they shift (nothing significant).  It was necessary to make room for them since while they were crooked, they fit just fine. The slenderizing allows for them to shift into the proper places.  This is one of the few things the actual orthodontist does himself as he has an assistant that applies the actual braces and re-wires them etc.  However I am now to the point where I need the final wire bent in certain places to tweak the shifting of my teeth so the orthodontist must do that himself.<br>  <br>  Once your braces come off, your regular dentist can do all sorts of "cosmetic" things for you.  My dentist personally cannot wait! :)<br>  <br>  PS:  There is nothing wrong with gums showing.  Smiling people look good!  And you won't be so self-conscience about it either once the braces come off.|`|r7tllHjuaa	They look a bit crooked.<br>  The dentist (not orthodontist) may file them down a bit...|`|oGyL9WJ1aa	I think they look good. Probably have a little more time to go with the braces but they are coming along.<br>  You can train yourself not too smile so big but I think you have a great smile now.|`|4SKIE1C8aa	Yes they look pretty straight! I don't think there's really a way to show less gums when you smile...and no they don't file your teeth...besides, it would look funny if they filed yours since the bottom length is fine, your gums are just really high.
yDJiiqcsaa	Neosporin is magical stuff and would probably help the scratch heal quickly but it might result in a yeast infection because the neosporin will kill off the bacteria and the yeast will flourish.  Phone your OB/GYN.
D4BRrUVxaa	Sorry, but he sounds either young or very selfish. He should do whats comfortable for YOU and be concerned about your feeling first. It's going to hurt for the first time regaurdless no matter how many toys you use beforehand. <br>  <br>  I would think twice about giving it up to him. If you do make sure that you use protection and plenty of lube.|`|6EzvfrCzaa	First of all its your choice about your virginity not his.And if you feel uncomfortable with the toy then you maybe have to try some type of lubrication so it would not hurt as much. But if that continues to hurt then tell him your not ready|`|qDGfoqW0aa	He is pushy, do it at your own pace, missionary position is most comfy the first time, when you are ready. It will hurt some at first until entry is made and hyman is broke, but then it is enjoyable|`|FZjXs7lPaa	dont do something youre uncomfortable with. its not worth it. go at your own pace even if thats abstinence. its your life|`|rIFqv8nvaa	If it hurts dont do it! You will have plenty of opportunities to have sex, why rush in. If he dosent understand then he isnt much of a boyfriend. Take your time, if you feel urges and still feel pain tell hime to use the toy, or give you oral. Once again if he objects, dump him. Its suppose to be pleasurable for both parties, not just one.|`|AA10723498	Good for you,  Don't give in until you're ready and you will know when you're ready to take that leap..  Sex for the first time will be uncomfortable because the man has to penetrate the hymen but it doesn't last long.  You also will feel some slight bleeding from breaking this membrane.  It's the first and last time that will happen.  Don't be pressured into doing something you're comfortable with.  If he cares for you, he'll wait.  If you want to talk, you can e-mail me.  Ok  You don't have to do anything you don't want to.  Remember that.

AA11707529	Nope. Freckles aren't a disease to start with. They occur mostly in people with very fair skin, especially natural redheads. They occur from exposure to the sun. The more exposure, the more freckles are created, and the darker they become. The best you can do is keep your legs covered so the freckles will fade. But they will never disappear.|`|2324ca2619e6dee826826d027a6a3effaa	There are bleaching creams that may help them fade slightly, but they will always be there. <br>  <br>  personally I find freckles on a man sexy (maybe I'm weird), but my point is, even if you hate them there are people out there who think they are cute/sexy so don't be afraid to show your legs!|`|QhT9MjEoaa	Freckles are awesome!!!

I had heart surgery 5 yrs ago, I ended up with some complications, one is asthma. I take Advair, Spriva and inhalers. Because of what is in the first 2 it can lower your ability to fight infection. I end up using Z- pack sometimes for the sinus or upper respiratory infections. <br>  <br>     I don't know what your Mom is on as far as medicines but maybe there are some better alternatives. Some of what your taking about it also just reaction to the allergies. It also sounds like she could have something going on like Acid Reflux she should probably see an upper GI doctor for that. That may or may not be caused by the allergies. They can cause a number of problems. What part of the country do you live in? I am in Central Calif. there are ALOT of people here that get allergies. After testing they found what I am mainly allergic too is dust mites. I had people who thought it was my pets. Thankfully no, couldn't give them up!. <br>  <br>  We have some really good doctors here on some things but there is a limit to how much I trust doctors too, they don't have all the answers. And some of the medicines can in the long run, especially when mixed with others can cause more damage. They don't know what happens when you get 3 or 4 meds mixed with all the side effects of each etc. Look up Advair on Webmd.com and look up the side effects. You will be surprised. <br>  <br>    There are 2 things that I have found that help more than conventional meds. Glyconutrients, they help your cells communicate with each other more effectively. And that is important since without the proper communication it doesn't matter what you take or do it doesnt help much. I don't sell a product but have checked many out thoroughly and have found that the glyconutrients from Manatech is about the best. It is a little on the expensive side I take the least expensive one. A little is better than none. <br>  <br>    The other one I take is a product containing Restveratrol. I take a formula that is guaranteed in strength made by to Doctors that live in my area. I had checked into other brands and found this one to be the best of the lot. When I have taken these, I found that not only do I feel better but I have more energy etc. My doctors have all OK them as well and are surprised at the results. I also have Fibromyalgia. It seems to have helped that as well. <br>  <br>  The one with Resveratrol, there is a doctor in S. Calif that had stage 4 non lymphmaic cancer, worst cancer you can get and taking that when they checked him again 4 months later the were no signs of cancer I believe. At any rate it helped alot. <br>  If you would like to contact me and we can talk more about it, Bridget at peaceinhim33@yahoo.com I will give you my phone # or you can give my yours. <br>  I hope I can be of some help to your mom. Being sick is no fun. I was in a coma for over 2 months when I had my surgery.<br>  Take care.<br>  Bridget
9pLdhuBnaa	This bleeding that you are noticing is a common side effect of starting out on the pill for some women because the body is trying to adjust to being on the medication.  It can last up to a month in some cases.<br>  <br>  However, I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.
EhsZuZhsaa	I'm telling! LOL! <br>  As a type I diabetic, no this does not make any difference. You're question is not a simple one, nor the answer. You need to understand what type of test was provided. Urine, blood, etc. All have different methods. However from what I understand from the body is no matter how long it has been you could still test positive. THC stays in fat cells, fat cells break down for and in may ways. This test, this day, this specimen just happened to have THC enough to count as positive. Which means a fat cell or cells containing THC was exiting your system. <br>  Does that make sense to you? <br>  I would ask if possible to re-test and if not touching any as well eating well would assist perhaps. You break down MORE fat cells when purging or not eating. You're body must make energy so it feeds on itself. <br>  The diabetic's body depending on blood sugars....if you take a two glasses, and add water to one, then keep adding sugar while you pour back and forth between cups. Eventually it will thicken with enough sugar. The water cannot break down the sugar, which is similar to a diabetics body. You do a lot of damage to your system slowing the blood supply down by having high blood sugars. Keep them at recommended ranges and you'll live long enough to smoke after retirement. Mean while get your butt out there and work till then! <br>  <br>  Hope that helps...|`|XGkv5Y8Kaa	Contact your Dr.

I have a condition that causes me to have this pain all over my face and head so I know how bad it hurts and can totally sympathize with you. And, you are right if it persists then you should go get it checked out.It is most likely an issue with the nerves. It could be something pressing on one like from a sinus infection or something. If it continues or gets worse your doctor can prescribe you a mild pain medication to help with the pain. I personally take Ultram and it works well at keeping the pain away. Look up a condition called Trigeminal Neuralgia and see if any if those symptoms fit with what you are having. Trigeminal is the name of the nerves in the face and Neuralgia stands for pain.|`|eb7939afceea213fb37cb6c2a376ba3faa	I'm not a doctor, but it could be a form of neuralgia ( trigeminal) which my father had.|`|1rFYElOnaa	Same thing happens to me and I'm not sure why...It actually happened to me yesterday|`|C62F31Dwaa	You could have been bitten by something, or it could be stress.

TdqeC0vmaa	wow to all the answers.<br>  <br>  This is a definite positive symptom of something. If you get checked out and all possible psychological or neurological disorders are ruled out then you could start debating weather or not your psychic or seeing ghosts. <br>  <br>  This is likely a hallucination. And it likely isn't bipolar disorder because your mood changes as a response to the hallucinations themselves which scare you. <br>  <br>  Since you said you do not use drugs there are a few sources that I can think of.<br>  <br>  Do you take any "home remedies" or supplements that may raise your dopamine level. Some supplements or other medications can have this side affect.<br>  <br>  If your not on or have not changed any medications recently are you under a great deal of stress or sleep deprived. Both of these can cause psychotic like symptoms<br>  <br>  If none of the above are the source then you may be experiencing a type of neurological issue like form of seizure or a psychological issue like schizophrenia. Although it is far less common for individuals with schizophrenia to have visual rather than auditory hallucinations some individuals do have just visual. <br>  <br>  If you can rule out the obvious issues of being overstressed over tired and supplements or medications... in fact even if you cant... <br>  you should definitely see a doctor and tell them about what you are experiencing so they can rule out or in anything serious.|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	My suggestion consult a psychic so they can see if you have any negative vibe around you: And my second suggestion is consult a psychiatrist or psychologist to make sure there isn't no type of disorder|`|naEk1QkSaa	Did u ever see ghost whisperer?  mayb ur like the main girl on that show! u kno, she helps Ghost so they could go and leave earth!|`|Ddfff5psaa	woah, either you have a 6th sense or you are seeing things....|`|A4yrPokPaa	get some help.  have you done a lot of drugs or anything that started this off?|`|l23ttRePaa	Sounds like the beginnings of Bi-Polar, Manic Depressive Disorder, my nephew who is now deceased as of 2 years ago was 44 and he had those symptoms.

Nothing wrong with it, because everyone else was fine, but it was just so oily/greasy that it made me feel ill so I went to the bathroom and put it all back up again.<br>  <br>  Sure sure I know that's not really the same thing, but I've done the same thing after eating a bunch of cake, cookies and candy, too because I felt like I'd eaten something extremely unhealthy for me.<br>  <br>  My reasoning is not an excuse, having a vom after a meal that was not tainted or off is not something I should have done.|`|23ea1115fdb8ab7241555cf164471723aa	Sorta. If your doing these things on purpose<br>  You shouldn't feel guilty about what you eat, you should just have something healthy to balance it out or just get active. Your probably gonna hear that a lot but it's true. You don't have to be super active, you can do something simple like a quick walk around the neighborhood.

Sorry. <br>  <br>  Get well soon.|`|F9Uz05FXaa	that sounds like bulimia, and even though its not very sever right now i think over time you may become dependent on it and it will become a problem.|`|7gyvOQMWaa	It is not bulemia yet but if this continues it will becomebulimia it MUST stop! Dont do it.|`|gvxGhhBxaa	sounds like anorexia|`|5IHO0Z5laa	Let me preface my response with a reminder that I am not a Doctor.  That said, I do have some first hand experience with Bulimia or Bulimic behavior.  When I was a college student I was somewhat chunky--not fat, although I thought I was huge.  It started just as you mention in your letter-- occassional and not out of control.  The problem is that it can become "out of control" very quickly.  The guilt you feel is not warranted.  We should not feel guilty nourishing our bodies.  What happened with me is that it became a tool that allowed me to be in control.  I'd eat and then feel bad or think I was going to gain weight and so I'd throw up.  Eventually, when I was wearing a baggy size 3 and still asking friends if I looked fat,  I knew I was whacked!<br>  This is something that is bigger than you-- please take it seriously.  Yes, what you have begun is characteristic of Bulimia.  As far as the physical signs that you mention-- sometimes it takes years for it to show in the teeth, skin or hair- but it will show.  More frightening however, is the damage that this condition can cause to your organs.   Bulimia can cause irregular heartbeat, kidney failure, electrolyte imbalance, hair loss, low blood pressure, loss of your menstrual cycle, etc.  <br>  I've been long-winded I know--  sorry.   Just please talk to someone about this.  Maybe it's nothing but the feelings you have after eating concern me.  Bulimia really is an eating disorder that occurs because of a mental perception or set of ideas usually formed at a young age, and it can take years to overcome it's shadow.  You health probably wouldn't suffer much if any if you could stop now.

Once you accept the fact that you will die, life becomes so much more enjoyable.<br>  <br>  Is it the method of death that scares you or the notion of no longer being alive on this plane of life?<br>  <br>  I came to terms with my death through responsible well researched use of psychedelics.  Many times I have gotten to a point in the trip where I felt strongly I was going to die, then accepted it and went through it.  Of course I came out fine each time as anyone who is well informed on the subject will understand, but the experience of "dying" became a familiar one.

FicyC2TXaa	The chances of breast cancer at 14 are close to zero. 80% of those diagnosed are over 50, less than 0.1% are under 30 and it's almost unheard of in under 20s. <br>  <br>  The American Cancer Society and other cancer organisations recommend that women start breast self examination at the age of 20.<br>  <br>  Pain is rarely a symptom of breast cancer - most people diagnosed with breast cancer have felt no pain. What you describe is hormonal.<br>  <br>  Most breast lumps, even in women over 50, aren't cancerous. <br>  <br>  The fact that both breasts are the same makes it even less likely to be anything sinister. If you had breast cancer at your age, your case would be written up in medical journals worldwide because its extreme rarity would make it of enormous interest to the medical profession. Having it in BOTH breasts would be even rarer still.<br>  <br>  Your breasts are still growing and developing and what you describe is almost certainly hormonal. <br>  <br>  Talk to your mother about this. If you feel you can't do that, talk to your school nurse; she will be used to girls having worries like this and will take you seriously and will be able to reassure you.<br>  <br>  Please stop worrying about breast cancer.<br>  <br>  .|`|hBmafVYoaa	I think it is highly unlikely you have cancer.

Given that it is used in baking, it also implies safety. Baking soda is sprinkled on the toothbrush, and teeth then cleaned using a gentle, circular motion. Care should still be taken though, especially for people with gum sensitivity. Old wives’ recipes often state that a paste of baking powder, a little salt, and a few drops of white vinegar, works effectively.<br>  <br>  Salt, used exactly as baking soda, is also touted as being a good teeth whitener. However, it might just be its osmosis, dehydrating action that makes teeth appear whiter, since dehydrated teeth look whiter. <br>  <br>  Lemon juice is often used, but it had high acidic levels, so teeth can weaken in the long run. Other natural, fruit options regard rubbing the inside of an orange peel on the teeth. A strawberry cut in half and the inside rubbed on teeth also works. Mashed strawberry can also be applied with a toothbrush. Apple cider vinegar is also said to be effective. Dried orange rind, and walnut bark, is also good.<br>  <br>  For other effective home teeth whitening solutions, you may wish to read about them here :  <a href="http://teeth-whitening.my-fashion-house.com/" rel="nofollow">http://teeth-whitening.my-fashion-house....</a>|`|XsqlvtI9aa	Use teeth whiten swabs !

v8Jw4wRPaa	Having chlamydia makes you more susceptible to HIV, and slightly more susceptible to other STDs such as genital herpes and gonorrhea. Often a chlamydia test will incorporate a gonorrhea test, however, so you have probably have already been tested for gonorrhea if you know for certain that you have chlamydia.<br>  <br>  Because your immune system is slightly imbalanced with an infection like chlamydia, and because the conventional treatment is antibiotics, this can lead to you developing thrush or bacterial vaginosis largely as a result of your treatment. Both can be dealt with with OTC medications but it is best to discuss any further complications with your doctor, as someone who has transmitted chlamydia to you for whatever reason may have transmitted other STDs. The best thing to do is not panic, but familiarise yourself with the symptoms of other STDs and keep a look-out for any abnormal changes because you're the one who knows your body best.|`|92iuiuZKaa	The chances are higher!

VC7PyH53aa	There's different ways to handle gaps other than braces. <br>  Retainer, crowns, bonding, etc.<br>  Your dentist should go over all options with you. <br>  Good Luck.|`|3KyVMVncaa	Well, he could either lightly file them down to make them smaller, or add some composite material to fill in the gaps. If your teeth are badly misaligned then he may suggest braces. I would at least go for a consult with an orthodontist, to get as may opinions as possible, good luck.
03rggPF2aa	stop doing drugs and you'll have money|`|1Akk3hZyaa	well to sell your semen, there are specific reqirements i saw it on Spiketv's Manswers google it, and your blood is something like $20 a quart or more
ufgv7oTjaa	The other answer is right that there may be a sperm clinic in your area that might pay for your sperm... it would depend on what's available in your area.<br>  There also may be some places in your area that buy plasma... but typically they don't pay much. Type AB blood isn't often needed and I don't know of any places that will pay for whole blood unless you're running tests for drug companies or something.<br>  <br>  If you're really hard up, there are options like the payday loans or pawn shops (for things that aren't as important to you). Aside from that, there are some companies that have a daily work-daily pay setup (where you get paid at the end of the day for that day's work)... if you aren't working any day in the next couple weeks, you could always do that for some quick cash. Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|x2mgUMb6aa	it's only around ￡10 for semen.not enough me thinks.<br>  better trying medical trials,they pay much more ,but pay day only about 2 weeks away,if desperate try payday loans from cash converters etc.<br>  alternatively i will lend you ￡400 till pay day @10% interest.<br>  get in touch if interested.|`|VFhE8nBxaa	Red Cross allows people to sell plasma for $20.00|`|RfeF9KGSaa	google sprem clinics and call them

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	1) The most likely explanation for your early period is a 'hormonal hiccup',  this is very common and happens to some women from time to time- even if it hasn't happened before. It is nothing to worry about and you only need to see your Doctor if this starts happening on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  2) It could be like a normal period or simply a light bleed/spotting. There is no real way of knowing, you will have to wait and see.<br>  <br>  3) If it seems like a little bleed (break-through bleed or spotting), then count day of your period from the first day of your last period (before this episode). If this bleed turns out to be a proper period then count this as your period that has come early and count day one as today- so your next period will be approx 28 days from today.<br>  <br>  It's likely you will still come on when you are next supposed to.|`|dzyJw0cvaa	1. I would say its stress.  Some lucky women MISS their periods when they are stressed...but not me.  I usually start bleeding a week early if i am really stressed during that point in time.  So yes, it could be your period and it is most likely stress.  However it is not uncommon for the body to just do its own thing sometimes for no reason!  periods can usually be unusual if that makes any sense! <br>  2. When it happened to me it was very light and it almost went away until my regular period came, then it was back full force.  So i would say it is likely to be lighter than normal.<br>  3. I think your next one will just start when it usually does.  At least thts what happened to me.  And it doesnt happen very often.  but maybe your body is just switching its schedule.  When i was a teenager my period would come a few days early every time, so every month it was different, yet it only lasted for the one week.  It was terrible, i couldnt make any plans around my period because i never knew when it was going to come!  Then i got on birth control...yet even then it seems to have its own agenda sometimes.<br>  <br>  I would say dont worry unless you start feeling any other symptoms like pain or anything.  then you should probably be checked out.  GOOD LUCK!|`|vDC8TXJraa	hey, first of all, if your young and have been having periods for not that long, then there's nothing to worry about. It will probably take ages for your periods to get into a proper routine, everyones bodies are totally different. Even if you are not that young, its probably nothing to worry about. Im 19 and have been getting periods for about 4 years now, and mine still arent into a proper routine, so i really wouldnt worry. Iv been on and off the pill a few times sinces starting my periods, which made mine really irregular. If your periods arent in a routine yet then going on the pill does steady them out and make them less heavy. But just dont do what i done, and go on the pill then off it, then on it, then off it again... that will mess it up a bit more lol :) x
8asG4WCwaa	With PCOS, not all women have the cysts.  Do be surprised if you don't, either.<br>  <br>  While they are still trying to understand why that is, there is a lot of interesting research being done.  It appears that women without the cysts have more endocrine systems involved in the problem (such as the adrenal and thyroid glands), which may result in a more effective treatment for them (and generate yet another new name for PCOS - type 1 for cysts and type 2 without cysts, maybe).  <br>  <br>  There is also some question about which comes first in some cases - the insulin reistance or the PCOS.  Some women do not show impaired glucose reponse, at least initially, with the PCOS.  Others do.  In the one study, a researcher wondered if impaired glucose first might be more common in the women without cysts.  Interesting possibility.<br>  <br>  Depakote (used to treat epilepsy) can cause PCOS.  However, as use of the medication was expanded to other mental illnesses, it has been noted that many women with PCOS had it (the PCOS) before they started using depakote. In addition to this, many women with PCOS have mood swings and/or depression, which is how they ended up in treatment for mental illness.  It is possible that proper treatments for the PCOS would allieviate the mood swings and/or depression, and they do not need depakote after all.  <br>  <br>  As for the need to urinate more often, that can be symptomatic of many problems, not just diabetes (although, with PCOS, it is certainly a possibility).  Every two or three hours really isn't a  huge problem.  Many diabetics were needing to use the restroom every thirty minutes when they finally went to the doctor.  Not all of them noticed excessive thirst, especially those who normally have a drink available to them most of the day.  You should talk to your doctor.<br>  <br>  Do you have any other symtoms of diabetes?  Tired?  Hungry?  Headaches?  Frequent infections?  Sweating?  Feeling bloated?  Gas?  Diahrrea?|`|AA11932993	I don't think you are diabetic because your G.B G test indicates that you are normal and also there is no strong symptoms of diabetic ie an excessive thirsty and frequent urinating.However the loose of your weight may be something else.|`|iAKIgFsoaa	More likely overactive thyroid glands-if you feel a bit "speedy" now-days,maybe shaking hands,restless,a bit insomniac,excessive sweating...|`|2VCJ07XHaa	overactive thyroid?|`|AlCfnJKYaa	It could be, but I wouldn't put money on it.  My advice is to let your doctor do the diagnosing.
8asG4WCwaa	If you now loosing weight without trying, you may have developed type 2 diabetes (common occurance with PCOS).  Weight loss is one symptom of uncontrolled diabetes.  You would not necessarily need insulin, type 2 can be treated well with diet, exercise, and prescription pills, if needed.<br>  <br>  Not all women with PCOS gain weight, and not all of them develop diabetes, but it's pretty common.  You should talk to your doctor, soon.<br>  <br>  My wife has PCOS.  I have the diabetes.  It's a family joke now :-)
CBgDc1Auaa	they eventually will... the problem with the trays is that they only have lasting effects for up to 6 months... upon which time you have to redo them... <br>  <br>  continuing this routine will weaken your enamel and make your teeth more susceptible to breaking, disease, and bad breath.
8iYVHA1raa	Lower your salt intake and exercise - Something low impact like walking since you are pregnant.|`|UU1YR1Kaaa	Diet just as said before, and excercise believe it or not.  I did not have HBP with my pregnancies I was borderline diabetic.
epBOAXUraa	omg dieting would be so much easier when kids and hubby don't pull you down.<br>  <br>  However there is a solution - put yourself first!!  Overhaul your cupboards and put everyone on the same 'healthy eating regime' (not a diet).  Beans on toast is not an unhealthy meal if it is brown bread and low sugar/salt beans. Kids are resiliant and will eat what is put infront of them unless they are given a choice.  As for husbands, i just made healthier versions of our usual meals and gave him a large portion and used a smaller plate for myself (then i didn't feel robbed of a nice meal).  if they follow your meal regime for a week give them the option of a fastfood meal, cooked or collected by hubby and eaten whilst you have a pamper bath/ go to gym / anywhere that takes you out of the kitchen and dining room.<br>  <br>  Biggest ever tip - teach your kids to scrape their leftovers stright into the bin after meals so you won't be tempted to pick at them.  My 3 and 5 year olds even do this and it is such a help!!!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|BH7VpjJNaa	It is hard to stay on a diet when you have a family.  The trick is to make small changes that the family can live with.  Slowly go from whole milk down to 2%, 1 1/2%, 1%, then fat free.  You can decrease fat content in cheese and beef as well.  Gradual decreasing is the key.  Most people won't notice if it is gradual.  Also, get more exercise by playing with the kids.  Good luck!|`|WIdMvtboaa	Yes! I feel that when I am single I can easily watch what I eat and I am not going out to dinner and lunch as much as I would be in a relationship. I can also go to the gym whenever I want to for how ever long I want to.|`|E9163D7jaa	When i was on my own, i had no cellulite on my legs etc, I only ate when I was hungry and ate beans on toast or sandwiches but now I have a family I make big 3 course family meals.<br>  So yes its easier to diet and exercise on your own!!|`|wwRbkCMraa	LOL, you're right!!!  maybe you should look at this HCG diet we put on our forum... it seems easy and very promising. <a href="http://buybulkwhey.com/forum/index.php?topic=103.0" rel="nofollow">http://buybulkwhey.com/forum/index.php?t...</a>|`|STQuFtaYaa	definitely

I've had a quickie before leaving for work (5 minute quickie).  <br>  <br>  It also depends on how long you've been together.  I can't remember the last time my husband and I went all night long.

xCCyGtv2aa	Are you seriously considering suicide just because those people are jerks?   <br>  <br>  Your personal problems are nobody else's business, and it is wrong of them to tease you.  But that amounts to their insufficiency, not yours.   Have you discussed these feelings with your therapist?  If you don't have one, please find one.

But if I left it at that I would be a hypocrite. Not all that long ago I attempted suicide over a very similar situation. I know how impossible it feels. Like you have nothing going for you, people think you're the stupidest thing to walk the planet, you're so behind in what you need to get done, you'll never be in a relationship and nothing will ever change no matter where you go. <br>  <br>  These people you're talking about especially the woman are heartless jerks. I know how it hurts when things like this happens, but please don't let these people win. This is your life and you are in charge of it. If you don't like something you can change it. I know its easier said then done, believe me last week was so rough for me I just wanted to give up. But bad things happen to everybody and its not the end of the world even though in the moment it feels like it. Keep on plugging through life, don't let the rest of the world win. Create the circumstances you want. Trust me its hard work but little by little it can be done. <br>  <br>  IM or e-mail me anytime to talk, etc.
dpgXzMenaa	Two things will make you wet "down there"... both are normal and healthy, they both have a scent, and they're *supposed* to happen.<br>  <br>  1) Your genitals keep themselves clean and healthy by sort of "rinsing" themselves with the fluids that they make (this will happen constantly beginning in early puberty, 24/7 for the rest of your life, but you won't always notice it)... sometimes there's quite a bit of fluid and it can leak out a *lot*, so wearing panty liners or even light pads can be a good thing to help keep your clothes clean.<br>  <br>  2) When your body is aroused sexually ("turned on" or "horny", even if you're not doing or thinking anything sexual) your genitals will get wetter and slipperier... sometimes very, *very* wet... so that a penis can slide in there comfortably if you have sex like it's telling you it wants (you don't have to, of course).<br>  <br>  I'm a cook, so the only things I can really compare the healthy scent of a vagina/vulva to are foods and such... and the nearest I can think of is a fairly mild combination of fresh oysters and grated truffles (the savory mushrooms, not the sweet chocolates) - musky and usually more on the sea-like side, but not "fishy" and certainly not unpleasant.<br>  <br>  It often smells stronger when you're sexually aroused or when you're sweaty after exercise or have spent most of a day in tight pants or clinging underwear, but not always... and it tastes much like it smells, but it's a little bit salty and less sweet than the scent suggests. (Don't be afraid to taste: it can give you info that your eyes and nose - even your *doctor* - can't provide you with, in addition to the fact that it's probable your boyfriend(s) and/or husband(s) are gonna do that anyhow if they have any brains... and it's sure not gonna hurt *them*.)<br>  <br>  If this "discharge" is clear or milky (might be tinted faintly yellow or brown), slippery to maybe a little sticky or stretchy, and smells "earthy, animal and a little like the ocean", it's almost certainly healthy and good. If it smells truly fishy or otherwise bad, especially if it itches or feels irritated, then it's probably an infection and you should see a doc.|`|e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	Yes it is normal.  You are experiencing a surge of estrogen.  It is temporary though.  Have you started your first period yet?  Usually, excess discharge precedes the first menstruation.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	hmmm i'd call your ob/gyn ... if you don't have one, get one, just to make sure, if it's like leaking out like a period, that doesn't sound right|`|AGlpdpAKaa	it's normal :)  you can try wearing a panty liner if it's making you uncomfortable.  this discharge is called cervical mucus, and it helps to track your fertile cycles.  the pink spots on your underwear means your period is probably coming soon.  if you google search "cervical mucus cycle" then you'll learn a lot more about it.  after your period you won't have too much.  then it will build up, and about half way through your cycle you'll notice a lot of it, (when you're ovulating *fertile*) and afterwards it should taper off again before your period comes around again :)|`|LNNgstaEaa	you could be getting ready to start your period. sometimes with some females their 1st period is like that.|`|McwWG9EHaa	nah

mLeEQpwHaa	I can well imagine your strong feelings on this subject.  Your government is spending so much on obesity, yet ignoring the most basic needs of the population in general.<br>  <br>  Obesity has become such an obvious problem in western countries. All of our governments are trying to overcome an attitude from the east that we in the west are greedy,  power hungry, over fed, selfish and nasty.<br>  <br>  This is the reason for the current spending on Bariatric surgical treatments.  It is a decision based on politics and not compassion or care for the people.<br>  <br>  The health systems of all of our western countries are failing because of the costs involved in caring for the most wealthy in our societies.<br>  <br>  Hospitals are in disarray because no specialists will work in the public system with so much work and so little payment.<br>  Eye and ear clinics have been the first to go in this state.  Neither do we  have any vascular surgeons, or neurology surgeons in the public hospitals.<br>  <br>  The advent of Centres of Excellence and GP Super Clinics is coming ever closer in Australia too.  It is the way of future health care policy to overcome the spiralling costs of health care for the weak and the poor by sending them all home to be cared for in the community by under educated, so called registered carers.<br>  <br>  I agree with you that some diseases are brought on by our own choices in life and we are left in old age with the sum total of abuse we have done to ourselves.  I hesitate to judge others as I too have suffered many medical problems of my own creation.  I have, however tried to overcome the bad habits I had as a teenager.  I am just another mortal human and I believe we have all made poor choices at times.

The Actos is very expensive.<br>  <br>  I doctor that deals with liver function might be specialist in internal medicine.<br>  <br>  The best plan is to make incremental healthy changes. Cut out those bad carbs. you can reward yourself with a candy bar that fits into a glycemic index and has sugar alcohols instead of sugars. Get a little more exercise now and increase it a little each week or two. Don't do anything drastic to overstress yourself.<br>  <br>  If you're going to drink alcohol, I would recommend sticking with 1-2 glasses of red wine.|`|s7ms1aU0aa	Doctor told me fish oil pills help with triglycerides, i would try those and eat less of an amount of food instead of subbing it out completely|`|uzZuwtgXaa	Your liver is a filtering system.

Family Practice or Internal Medicine?  Internal Medicine doctors (in my opinion) are better suited for adults.  Some suggestions for you:<br>  <br>  1.  On a piece of paper tonight, write down all of your questions and concerns that you'd like to address with your doctor upon your next visit.<br>  <br>  2.  Your doctor will probably refer you to either an Internal Medicine doctor or a Gastroenterologist.<br>  <br>  3.  By having COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) you're probably experiencing swelling of your extremities.  Maybe your lower extremities as well.  COPD can affect more than just your lungs and your heart.<br>  <br>  4.  A bacterial infection can also cause liver issues.  Also what type of diabetic medication are you taking?  This could cause liver issues as well.  <br>  <br>  The bottom line?  Jot down on a piece of paper questions that you feel are important to you, that you'd like to address with you doctor.  Good luck to you!|`|ao4adX9Uaa	wow u hav alot of probs. i think wut is happenin 2 ur liver is either da diabetes is makin it work hard to clean ur system or u obviously take medicine so if u overdosed dat could cause ur liver to act up because jst lik alcohol da meds r poison ur liver may need 2 take out|`|SOxdyWQOaa	my hubby has the same problem no red meat, eat skin less chicken, cut out butter and try eating turkey burger <br>  yes that can mess with your liver
lkhCeAdJaa	I just had a wisdom tooth pulled 6 days ago.  It doesn't hurt bad at all.  I didn't even know when it came out.  Everyone is different, of course but really, you've had a baby right?  This ain't nothin' compared to that!;-)|`|s8VgyzE2aa	I agree with the first person, make sure you are going to an oral surgeon! I had my first wisdom tooth pulled by a dentist and I don't what the heck he did but I was in so much pain it was worse than childbirth, no joke! I was on the strongest possible pain killer and it didn't even touch the pain. <br>  <br>  After that I was terrified to get the next three out and they need to come out. Finally I had no choice, they were rotting in my mouth. This time I went to an oral surgeon and had all three pulled out at the same time and I had NO pain. The pain meds worked great and by the third day I was just taking Tylenol. It was such a different experience so it depends who you go to.<br>  <br>  I am not sure about the cost because I think my insurance covered the whole thing.|`|tGEMwgyBaa	If you are going to an Oral Surgeon to have your wisdom teeth taken out, you should not have any pain. What you will feel is pressure and you will hear the tooth cracking do to the pressure of the instrument taking out the tooth. So ask yourself at the time, am I feeling pain or am I feeling pressure and really weird noises. If you do feel pain, always let your dentist know, you should not feel pain. I work in a dental office and insurance for an extraction of a wisdom tooth will very. The office you are going to should go over the cost with you prior to treatment. You can also call your insurance company and ask them how much you are cover for a surgical extraction. Most insurances will cover at 80% of the dentists fee and some will cover at 90%-100% if you have really good insurance. Good Luck, I hope this was helpful.|`|Y6YrRo7Uaa	Well when I got my wisdom teeth out it was all four at once, and they put me to sleep, so of course I didn't feel anything. But a week after the surgery i got dry socket, and when I refused further treatment due to it being more painful than the condition, the doctor said that dry socket can be more painful than getting wisdom teeth out regularly, and it didn't turn out to hurt so bad. The plus side was that I got some kick a** pain killers after the teeth were removed. And I have government insurance, and there was no copayment, but government insurance is among the best coverage|`|J9EK7r2maa	make sure its a oral surgery,not just any denist,i had 3 of mine out,was not bad at all,and mine were deep,i heard that a root canal was bad,but you should be fine

Hq6nSl1Qaa	Look at my answer to your other question.  I wouldn't rely on aloe vera - ESPECIALLY when your immune system is so aggravated.  You could precipitate an allergy to aloe too... and that would make "worse" into "even worse."  Keep in mind that this is not "a burn" anymore than someone eating shellfish when they are allergic is "burning" their stomach and mouth.|`|swTjhCznaa	if youre already on medication, why do you want more?<br>  <br>  just let the meds take their course.|`|AA10783888	Fresh aloe juice will work if it is from the plant, you just break off a piece of the foliage and the smear the juice on your burn and it will help immediately. I don't think the juice (like from the health food store) would have the same effect, you are just supposed to drink it. I hope this helps you, and good luck!|`|DzhMtxxaaa	ofcourse, thats wat aloe is meant for...itll definately work and i totaly disagree with the guy above me !!!!!^
94P7B7YZaa	It's either <br>  Prententiousness,<br>  Bipolar,<br>  or Schizophrenia.|`|LGidAYDwaa	It used to be called Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) and some people get it confused with Schizophrenia as well. Now it's called "dissociative identity disorder" (DID). <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=38077" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/a...</a>  about DID<br>  <br>  DID is a mental illness, so it can be caused by a chemical imbalance and people who have a parent with DID are more likely to have DID themselves. It can also be caused by trauma or abuse. Some of the most famous cases of DID center around women who've been physically, sexually, mentally, and emotionally abused by someone in their life.  (The Three Faces of Eve and Sybil come to mind - you can read more about them at IMDB.com, since movies were made about these two cases.)|`|IxLkAEA3aa	its called schitzophrania (not sure how to spell it) there is no cause realy your born wiht it... google it<br>  <br>  nd|`|lk03YYPEaa	It sounds like dissociative identity disorder, which wikipedia says is "psychiatric diagnosis that describes a condition in which a single person displays multiple distinct identities or personalities".<br>  <br>  This is what I found on wikipedia about the cause:<br>  "The causes of dissociative identity disorder have not been identified, but are theoretically linked with the interaction of overwhelming stress, traumatic antecedents, insufficient childhood nurturing, and an innate ability to dissociate memories or experiences from consciousness. A high percentage of patients report child abuse."|`|tkpBDLwYaa	Sounds like a common yet not well-researched disorder called Prententiousness.
fZmvWv7qaa	Wake him up.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Wake him up for the pain medicine.<br>  <br>  It's important to stay ahead of the pain. It is much easier to keep it controlled that way. If the meds wear off completely he will be in extreme pain and it will be hard to relieve it again.<br>  <br>  Whoever said if he's asleep he doesn't need pain meds - that's correct for a patient-controlled pump - you shouldn't push that button for the patient who is sleeping. However that pump delivers a steady stream of pain relief whether the button is pushed or not.<br>  <br>  In other words, you need to keep up that basic pain relief by taking the pills on time.|`|ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	A person doesn't need pain meds if they are sleeping.  If teh pain becomes a problem, he will wake up, and he can take his medicine at that time.  If it's been a while since he's eaten, he can have a snack or glass of milk with the pill and that will serve the saem purpose as taking the pill after a meal.|`|lTNcvqyHaa	It is important that medications be taken on time and as directed (ie with or without food) However, if the doctor's have given him medication to sleep and help remove the pain let him sleep on for at least another 30 mins. Then gently wake with some food wait 15 mins after eating and then give him his medication. You will probably find that he will slip back into sleep if he remains pain free.|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	Phone doctor.|`|a7b81aec51d8df49e523d067b9b07ea9aa	i say wake him, he needs his meds. thats what i would do. i hope he gets better soon :)|`|AA10481463	Let him sleep. The healing process begins while you are asleep. It is important for him to have his 8 to 12 hours of sleep. Give him the meds when he wakes up. Eating is also important. Give him the nutrients he needs. Milk is a very good source of calcium. Bones need calcium.  I know it is uncomfortable for you to have him sleep on the couch, but when he awakes just help him to the bathroom and when he is done, help him to the bed. Serve him his dinner in the bedroom. Or maybe the television or internet will help him feel better.|`|taFHiG5naa	Honestly, if he really need the meds, I would gently wake him up and have him eat the lunch with the meds and then you can keep him company till he falls asleep.<br>  <br>  If anything let him take the meds and then go right back to sleep, keep him company till he does though, it'll make it easier for him.|`|LQwP8WDdaa	Well it has been 4 days since this happened, so it would be best to wake him up. :) nah. just ignore me, I somehow found myself looking through your questions after giving an answer to the b**er question you posted. So I guess I am only posting this while I wait for my lovely girl-friend to get here with my chinese food. :)|`|Ybu2E2OWaa	you should wake him up and give him his meds and the reason he is sleeping right know is because he can't feel the pain in his leg. Also I think you should do Research an a prosthetic knee.

Any dog or cat that goes outside WILL get fleas, so make sure you get your dog a collar for it or spray him/her regularly. Oh, and I think they sell "flea bombs".

xCCyGtv2aa	Please get help right away.  Don't worry about what people will think.  It sounds like you still live with your parents.  Is there some reason you can't tell them how you are feeling?  <br>  <br>  Depression is a treatable illness.  I know how you feel, I have been really depressed before with suicidal ideation.  Please call one of those hotlines, or tell your parents you need to see a doctor.  You can talk to your family doctor about this.  Ultimately, you will need some good psychotherapy, too, but right now the best step is just to reach out and admit you need help.  <br>  <br>  You have numbers, but it seems like 8 numbers would be overwhelming to choose from.

I know in my heart God doesnt cause any of the hard, difficult things we go through, God is only all loving, he's all the beautiful things in this world, its the devil or evil in the world that cause pain. we are all both good and bad,just as well as we feel we don't diserve to suffer as we do in this life, we should also realize, we never diserved this life to begin with and all the wonderful things in it, but somehow love and beauty gave it to us.  It took me a long tome to realize the blessing in my life because i became negative because of the pain i had suffered, so i started to realize even the smallest things that were undiserved gifts in my life... a warm cup of hot cocoa....snuggled up watching a favorite show.... a devoted family member ( even when another family member had abused me my entire life)... why did i diserve the other to be so there for me?, ....a loving pet, a yummy delicious meal,a dream coming true,... just being able to run with my legs, wow what a mystery that is, and even for those who don't have the use of their legs they still find miricles in this life to get joy out of !

Even thou you have people in your life family and friends..you just feel like you have so much in life to figure out or you wish you could change.All i am saying is, you didnt say what your issue is. You did say you dont want to do it. So either you are taking a medicine that has a side effect that is causing you to have these feelings. Or you need attention and you feel you are the norm and you are not any better and anything or any better looking then average and you have no skills better then other people or you just like the feeling of the dark. Either get hobbies and or go outside or lay off the drugs or go to counseling. Take it from me i have attempted suicide more times then i know. All i know is no one person place or thing is worth it. Because i am not done with this ride. Because the bullshit i have been through is going to turn around. i know what you go through you go through for a reason. and anything you endure God puts you through it because he knows you are strong enough. Also you will be rewarded for the struggles you do go through. The thing is life is not going to stop unless God stops it. The reason for most suicides is accidental. They really didn't mean to but did on accident.|`|kikmSEYZaa	This is all I could find:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/imhs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/imhs/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/suicide/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/suicide/</a><br>  <br>  Please either check out these sites - or call a suicide hotline a.s.a.p.

There are people out there to talk to who can help. <br>  <br>  I will be praying for you - hoping you find what you need.|`|yeFZPMfXaa	You can email me if you have any more questions Ok, first thing, don't kill yourself there is sooooo many ways you can be helped. If you are depressed you can get medication that will make all of these sad feelings your having go away. My dad's bipolar and he was suicidal for a while when I was a kid, but he was put on meds and he has been a great dad! He's happy and doesn't think about it anymore. I'm not saying your bipolar, but your depression can be treated. The first thing I would do is talk to your parents. I know it probably would be very awkward, but they can take you to your family doctor and he can help you. If that is really uncomfortable and you are terridied of talking to them, you should still do it, but you could always go to a clinic yourself in the day. Depression is terrible but it is pretty much always curable, be it medication or a therapist. As for your suicidal feelings, it would be such a waste of your life, you would be throwing away your future, like getting through school, getting a great job, getting married, and maybe having kids. And life rocks anyways, it may feel like it sucks, but it does. And remember this depression you have is curable. You are not going to be stuck with these feelings for ever or anything, but you must talk to a doctor or a therapist. Call the suicide hotlines in the day at a payphone. Then go to a doctor. Don't hide your situation from your parents, they can help you. Find a quiet moment where you can sit down and talk to them, or talk to whoever your closest to. The main thing to remember is: Talk to somone, go to a doctor s/he will help you!<br>  <br>  Dont do it!<br>  <br>  You can email me if you need someone to talk to at: liamsp5590@gmail.com
tGEMwgyBaa	Your best bet is to go back to the dentist that made the dentures and have them do a soft reline on then. If you can't go to the dentist, go to the store and get some over the counter denture grip. This will act as a cushion. If you have dental insurance you insurance company should pay for a portion of the reline. Most insurance companies will pay for a new set of dentures every 5 years. I hope this was helpful, good luck!
kjW1fmmPaa	Depends where you are in your cycle now.  They usually tell you to start it the day of your period or the Sunday after because at that point, you will not have ovulated yet and the pill takes a week to become effective, which would be the time you would ovulate at.  But since you've been on the pill for a week already, you do not ovulate and it is therefore effective.<br>  <br>  Since you started taking the pill perhaps after you already ovulated this month, the pill will not protect you as well.  It can still thicken your cervical mucus, etc, but there is a much greater chance for pregnancy since you have ovulated (assuming you have already this month).  So in your case, especially if you took the pill 14 days after the first day of your last period (aka day 14 of your cycle), the pill has not reached its full potential, and will not until next month when it stops you from ovulating. <br>  <br>  You are more protected than people who don't use any birth control methods, but there is a moderate chance that the pill will not be as effective for you this month.  To be safe, I would recommend you use back-up protection (condoms) during sex for the next 4 weeks.  If you are not using the pill for contraceptive purposes and for other reasons, however, then disregard that.<br>  <br>  Also, your cycle might be a little messed up this month (your period may come late, or you may have spotting for several days when you would have gotten your natural period, and then you'll get an actual period when you go on the pill-free/sugar-pill week).

I though that he is not going made it to see me then later on it's pretty long time that I can't breath & my doctor told me that I having a panic attack & I was like what? no way!

It began bleeding really bad and hurt really bad, I did think I might almost die. I went to a clinic and had 7 bloody stitches. Still got a small bump/scar on my head after almost 10 years but I've mostly forgotten it now. <br>  <br>  Once when i was about 13/14 I played football in a park... just the kind of area with trees and grass fields... I thought I saw my mum write that I had asthma when I was 7 tho I never did, I only knew I had allergic rhinitis, sinusitis... after a while of football, something odd happened. I began wheezing really hard (like a dog that goes against its leash, sounds like its choking or strangling itself to death) and I couldn't breathe. I could stand up and walk and everything, but I just couldn't breathe, just kept on wheezing and pulsing really hard. I thought maybe that was asthma but it really choked me up (when someone tightens their hands over your throat or windpipe for half a minute). I went home after that, had some water, and stopped wheezing after 10 minutes, and I could breathe again... though I was still panting really heavily after that. I exercise, play sports, do everything, but until that time and even a couple years after I had and have never felt anything like it...|`|18e6c6ba7e558bb945b46902f7a5f9fbaa	Hi when i was 15 i was alone in the house and went to brush my teeth but instead of brushing my teeth i actually breathed in the same time i put the brush to my mouth and the toothpaste came off the brush and covered my windpipe i couldn't get air in or out and i looked in the mirror and my face was all purple and i said to my self im going to die i tried swallowing it but nothing happened and i was panicking and then all of a sudden i became really calm and somehow i managed to sit down on the toilet seat it was if someone was helping me i was so so calm it was unbelievable  and swallowed really hard a few times and it eventually cleared and i collapsed gasping for air i will never forget about that|`|nmC7qgtZaa	too many times, took too many drugs, <br>  <br>  <br>  had knives pulled on me<br>  <br>  <br>  gotten lost in the middle of no where in a foreign country with no money and no one to help me on numerous occasions|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	2005 had a stroke,I am ok now.|`|Mtck4Lzbaa	i was shot in the head with an arrow out of a compound bow. ok now...
nEVoabeSaa	At the young age of 47 I wet my pants in the middle of Town! I was just walking down the street and bang, biblical flood, wearing jeans! Therefore I took my fleece top off and threw it around my waist, tied the arms to the front and walked back to the car park in my T-shirt in the rain! Once back at the car I got the cover in the rear seat, used for my dog, put it on the drivers seat and drove home. Once home, inside the door I started stripping off my clothing and threw all into the washing machine. I then had a fast shower. Yeah I got away with it? Seems not because My Mother arrived and wanted to know why the washing machine was on and why was I in the shower, so I had to admit towetting my pants. I expected a reaction, instead all I got was 'Yes I thought that might happen?' Mum used to be a Nurse, so I asked what was going on? I have Arthritis and that week my neck had become inflmed, so Mother knew that the signals between bladder and brain would be delayed, but decided not to tell me of this known side affect. Instead once dressed she said 'I forgot to get some milk, can you run over to the shop for me?' I protested 'I just came back from Town having wet my pants and you want me to go out again, I might wet my pants again!' Mother replied 'You have already emptied your bladder, do not expect it will fill up that fast, do you?' What she was doing was giving me the Confidence to go out to the shop, otherwise no way was I ever going out again.<br>  Best of Luck|`|UEw1OQ4gaa	Yes! Lmao, It was grade 5 and I was playing man hunt ( different version of tag) and I was wearing those addidas pants with the buttons on the side.. and as I was running, they unbuttoned in a flash and I was standing there with only underwear on. I pulled them back up, but it was too late. My friends were already laughing at me. Then this pervy guy in my class was just like 'Monica, I wish I was there".<br>  <br>  :[|`|lTNcvqyHaa	Oh yeah - everyone has accidents everyday. <br>  <br>  Morale of the story is, don't try to juggle too many balls at once and when you do keep your mind on the job at hand.

I think there's also condoms with spermicide on them too.
xCCyGtv2aa	Your ex sounds like a Narcissist.  I'll bet isolation wasn't the only abuse he inflicted on you, either.<br>  <br>  Something that might really help you is Cognitive Behavior Therapy.  Any licensed psychotherapist will know how to do it.  CBT helps you re-evaluate your thoughts and replace harmful ones with healthy, rational ones.  <br>  <br>  5 years is a long time to live under someone else's thumb.  It is understandable that you would have lost a little bit of your will to fight back.  But you obviously found it again, and you are doing well to improve your situation.  It is normal and understandable that you would still be hurt.  I really think a good therapist will be able to help you move on and find your confidence.|`|es8CfccCaa	Im scared of failing so most times i wont even try at all.<br>  Don't be afraid of failing.

Then better & better.......<br>  Failure is just part of learning. Don't be afraid to Learn!<br>  <br>  Keep that guy out of your life - that's abuse<br>  A Failure and I hope a lesson learned<br>  Do your thing!

It's when everyone seems to be nicer than you, much better looking, and you feel useless, ugly inside and out. But think of it this way, your unique in your own way, there's always something you have that not one other person has, could be your smile/eyes/humour/hair. You can't be the judge of everyone, you may think people seem happy with they're life but you never know whats going on deep down. We all have problems. Its fighting those feelings that makes us want to live another day. Do something good, volunteer to work somewhere, go out to a social club, talk to people in supermarkets whilst waiting for your que. <br>  <br>  Always remember that we are really unique in our own way. You possess something that i don't.|`|h7uxxiZZaa	none of it is your fault. i just got away from a guy like that and i have had to see a therapist for it. I suggest you do the same.

You can chose to do one of two things from your experience: wallow in the sadness, or learn from it and become a better person. In order to overcome adversity, you must want to. Whenever you catch yourself thinking negatively, replace that thought with something positive. Self Confidence is extremely important in life. Understand that you are a remarkable woman who can make a difference in the world. Consider helping others to make you feel better. It will be satisfying for you to know you made a difference in the world. Also in the morning take the time to look in the mirror and examine the positive features about yourself. If your body image is not what you would like it to be, then do something about it instead of just feeling sorry. The most important lesson in life is to live the way you want to live. Remember that you are an amazing person and try to remind yourself that every day.|`|AA12315136	There are a number of things you can do. First, realize that self doubt is addicting. Strange as it sounds, humans love negative energy. Realize this and when you feel doubt stop yourself .. "No, I AM a good person, I CAN do this ..etc".<br>  <br>  1) I recommend a group (crafts/art/church/yoga ..)<br>  2) Tonight, take a bunch of sticky notes and write a positive thing about yourself on each one. Post the sticky's in random places (fridge, bathroom mirror, tv etc). REMEMBER negative energy is addicting so force yourself to be positive!<br>  3) Pray.  Pray.|`|BAy9alNUaa	I was in a relationship where i lost my job. i just moved in with him and the job i did have was making good money. I soon found out i was getting laid off. For the next two years I tried looking for work but only found small jobs that did not compare to what i had. During this time he  put me down so bad plus i gained weight. He didn't like any of my friends and i soon lost touch with them. After the relationship ended i didn't know how i was going to be alone. Even thou i was more independent before i meet him for years. I didn't know how to talk to people and i thought everyone in my personal and professional life had goals and had good lives. I have come to a conclusion that, you just have to go out and live life. Thats what everyone else is doing. I know i am fat now but i met a guy better looking then i ever thought i would get even when i was thin. I know a lot of friends and co-workers talk behind my back. But honestly don't be scared to trust them, with your issues. They may not be there for you and you need to know the only person you can depend upon is yourself. If you are like me then you can not believe how drama filled and petty girls are. Or how judgmental and deceitful men are. But the bottom line is your going to miss life, you only have one. Go live it.|`|ZAfqTQymaa	I'm really sorry you had a bad time with your ex, you didn't deserve that.  <br>  I know its hard not to doubt yourself, or compare yourself to others, but you have to realize that you are a special person, and you're different to everyone else in your own special way.  <br>  <br>  Be kind to yourself, make a list of things you love about your appearance, your personality, things you've done or acheived in the past.<br>  <br>  If you don't try anything, you'll never know whether you could have done it or not and, believe me, regret is the worst feeling in the world.  Decide what you want to do, but start small, and congratulate yourself on everything you achieve, however minor it may seem.<br>  <br>  And my number one tip, coming from a very self conscious person: if you think someone is judging you, remember; it's their problem.  They have to take time out of their day to judge you/dislike you, etc (even though they probably aren't at all).  You can hold your head high and say to yourself "hey, it's his issue, not mine", and get on with your day.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you, I hope everything works out, it sounds like you deserve it :}|`|axpfEwHTaa	Don't beat yourself up, you need to always tell yourself positive things even when your feeling your worst, even if you feel like what your saying to yourslef isn't true, try to do this everyday, it'll build confidence, also try taking it to the Lord, he always is there to listen. ;)

These side effects may include tremor, insomnia, nervousness, irritability, anxiety, headache, tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and stomach complaints (e.g. nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea). You may also notice palpitations, changes in heartbeat, an increased need to pass water and rapid breathing. <br>  <br>  <br>  I would not suggest doing what you did again|`|lFLsbDZxaa	Tell your mother, set up an appointment with your family doctor, and remember, you never know more then your doctor, don't come in saying 'I think I have a stomach ulcer!', it will only annoy them and he wont want you to be in his office.<br>  <br>  Tell him what you did, and he will schedule you for diagnosis, or he might tell you right on the spot.<br>  <br>  You knew all this already, if you did your research, and I hope that the worst doesn't happen!<br>  <br>  You'll sure as hell never do that again huh! =D<br>  <br>  Your only a kid still, we do stupid things, you wont have to worry about getting into much trouble =]

Now, look at what you've eaten today.  Great healthy choices.  And it appears that your meal plan today was fairly low in calories, so I think those extra protein bars are going to be okay.

eekwpTMRaa	Hey thats great! <br>  Like other answerers have said: METABOLISM :)<br>  you have also gotten out of that plateau, another thumbs up<br>  and your increase in food has told your body that your not starving yourself because for the amount of calories you've taken in in the past<br>  made your body think it wasnt getting enough so it held onto water and <br>  fats to keep you warm and running properly. I have a few friends that can eat and eat and eat and run like 2 miles a day and dont gain weight and sometimes lose it, its because your body knows that your getting enough and doesnt mind all the work. But you MUST remember that everytime you hit a plateau and you up your levels on anything, your food intake levels should also go up a bit :)  If you can help me with some of my questions, that would rock! good luck and hope i helped|`|RKoMl7xSaa	You are simply burning off the extra calories that you are consuming. are you eating more unhealthy foods or fruit and veg which are very easy to burn off?<br>  if you are just eating extra healthy food you are easily burning it off even with the same amount of exercise as before.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|9604dad549d1d9ec19f7dbd9698567fdaa	It depends on what u r eating more OF.

Try to lighten up on your exercising or eat more because it looks like you're gonna lose weight if you keep doing what you're doing right now. Also, it could just be the time of day you've weighed yourself. An average person's weight is said to fluctuate 2 pounds from day to day. If you weighed yourself after you ate, and then weighed yourself the next day after exercising, it could just be that the time of the day was different. Be consistent when weighing yourself because your weight will change depending on the time of day and what you were doing before hand.

dpgXzMenaa	Two things will make you wet "down there"... both are normal and healthy, they both have a scent, and they're *supposed* to happen.<br>  <br>  1) Your genitals keep themselves clean and healthy by sort of "rinsing" themselves with the fluids that they make (this will happen constantly beginning in early puberty, 24/7 for the rest of your life, but you won't always notice it)... sometimes there's quite a bit of fluid and it can leak out a *lot*, so wearing panty liners or even light pads can be a good thing to help keep your clothes clean.<br>  <br>  2) When your body is aroused sexually ("turned on" or "horny", even if you're not doing or thinking anything sexual) your genitals will get wetter and slipperier... sometimes very, *very* wet... so that a penis can slide in there comfortably if you have sex like it's telling you it wants (you don't have to, of course).<br>  <br>  I'm a cook, so the only things I can really compare the healthy scent of a vagina/vulva to are foods and such... and the nearest I can think of is a fairly mild combination of fresh oysters and grated truffles (the savory mushrooms, not the sweet chocolates) - musky and usually more on the sea-like side, but not "fishy" and certainly not unpleasant.<br>  <br>  It often smells stronger when you're sexually aroused or when you're sweaty after exercise or have spent most of a day in tight pants or clinging underwear, but not always... and it tastes much like it smells, but it's a little bit salty and less sweet than the scent suggests. (Don't be afraid to taste: it can give you info that your eyes and nose - even your *doctor* - can't provide you with, in addition to the fact that it's probable your boyfriend(s) and/or husband(s) are gonna do that anyhow if they have any brains... and it's sure not gonna hurt *them*.)<br>  <br>  If this "discharge" is clear or slightly milky (might be tinted faintly yellow or brown), slippery to maybe a little sticky or stretchy, and smells "earthy, animal and a little like the ocean", it's almost certainly healthy and good. If it smells truly fishy or otherwise bad, especially if it itches or feels irritated, then it's probably an infection and you should see a doc.|`|49LiABmvaa	you may be getting you're period

If someone has a heart attack they'll be given advice from a hospital about what to do anyway.|`|PWpETofKaa	lots of small changes can make a huge difference and prevent another heart attack or stroke. But make it a gradual thing because big changes all at once can have a negative approach on some people...run your plans by a medical practitioner first.<br>  Make sure your weight is within the lower end of the healthy BMI range by exercising more and eating less calories rich in fat, salt and sugar. Excess salt increases blood pressure and puts an unnecessary strain on your heart. You only need a maximum of 1g salt per day...not 6g, according to the latest research.<br>  Dont smoke as not only does this damage your lungs and effect gas exchange, but it hardens your blood vessels too, thus increasing blood pressure again.<br>  Drink in moderation.<br>  If your cholesterol is high, take statins prescribed by your GP, but a high fibre, low sugar diet, as well as plenty exercise also lowers it.<br>  Try and remove as many stressors in your life as you can so you feel mentally more at ease and not so stressed out, as this again puts strain on your heart.<br>  Caffeine from coffee, soft drinks, alcohol etc puts great stress on your adrenal glands; raising cortisol levels, elevating sugar levels and damaging insulin resistance/sensitivilty, all effecting your heart health.<br>  If you are diabetic make sure this is well controlled....if you are on hypertensive drugs make sure you remember to take them every time.<br>  <br>  LOTS OF EXERCISE AND A BALANCED DIET, KEEPING WITHIN A NORMAL HEALTHY WEIGHT RANGE WILL PROLONG YOUR LIKE FOR SURE!

BG8vMyZjaa	Some foods are also known to cause bloating so you might want to eat fewer of these. Typical culprits include beans, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, sprouts, onions and garlic – however, remember these are good sources of fibre and you should eat five portions of fruit and veg a day.<br>  Swallowing too much air can also give you a bloated tummy and surprisingly, there are several habits that can result in this. Simple things such as talking while eating, using a straw or sports bottle, chewing gum, eating when you’re on the move, drinking from a water fountain and eating when you’re upset are all common culprits so try and eliminate as many of these things as possible.<br>  Irritable bowel syndrome is also often associated with bloating. Generally a healthy diet will help you lose weight and keep the symptoms of IBS at bay. But again, if you think this is a problem, you should see your GP.
AGlpdpAKaa	i get the SAME thing.  it could be gluten.  try cutting gluten out of your diet for a few days and see if you notice a difference.  it's hard, but it will REALLY help you to feel better.  also make sure you're not eating too much sugar.  google search "gluten free diet" and it will help you to find things to eat.  i used to get so bloated i'd look about 4 or 5 months pregnant.  i stopped eating wheat and it went away!!  now my stomach is nice and flat all the time.  to take care of the alternating hard and loose poops, just try eating a really balanced diet of a lot of vegetables and eat grains like rice and oatmeal, and a SHITLOAD of water *s*  a lot of people get diagnosed with IBS when really all they have is a gluten sensitivity.  good luck!<br>  <br>  edit:  keep eating the yogurt.  the bacteria is extremely good for you.  even if you're lactose intolerant, you may be able to tolerate 1 yogurt a day (i am lactose intolerant, and i still eat yogurt).  also, do not use immodium or stool softeners.  try to cure it with diet! once you start using antacids and other things, it will screw up the chemicals in your stomach and you will be dependant on them and feel worse.  just use food.|`|dbXnW5emaa	It's not uncommon for women, especially teenagers and young women, to have this problem.

What I will say is that there are a lot of con's that outweigh the pro's.<br>  <br>  You're twenty nine and old enough to make your own decisions. If you want to do something like this, go for it. However, you should first try to gain weight just by altering your diet which should consist of a 45/35/20 ratio of carbs/protein/fats. Depending on your bodyweight, you should be eating around 3000 calories a day. AAS is not a miracle, and if you don't know how to gain weight naturally, AAS is not going to help you much.

One thing to realize is that while you are obese now, you are creating the healthy habits for your life.  What you do now is extremely important to how you live.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.halls.md/body-mass-index/bmi.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.halls.md/body-mass-index/bmi....</a><br>  <br>  You play soccer every day so you are highly active.  You are running lots not just standing there right?  If you play goalie it doesn't count.  <br>  <br>  Think about what you eat.  The first thing is to keep a food journal of everything you eat for 3 days.  Then you can analyze your intake.  Are you sure that's how many calories you are eating?<br>  <br>  Stop drinking all soda.  It's not healthy for you and is empty calories.  Stop eating chips, cakes, or junk food.  You need to be eating at least 5 times a day.  Eat all the fruits and veggies you want.  You cannot eat too many of them.<br>  <br>  Eat a good breakfast.  It's the most important meal of the day and starts your body for the day.  Eat lunch to keep going.  Skipping a meal is going to make your body slow down.  When you skip a meal your body thinks Whoa no food.  Better start conserving energy as I don't know when I'll get fed next.  It slows down the digestion.  If you eat every couple hours, your body says Hurry and digest b/c more is coming any minute and you burn more fat.  For dinner look up portion sizes.  Eat the healthiest thing on your plate first.  Move to the meat last.  After you've eaten all the veggies, you'll eat less of the fatty meat and starches.<br>  <br>  Start habits that you want to keep for life--riding your bike, taking the stairs.  You don't want to start a bad habit like dieting or taking pills.  But you have to keep that food journal first b/c you have to know what you DO before you know what to STOP doing.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|FebNOmqDaa	Losing weight can be done by a combination of at least 30 minutes cardio like your soccer game and diet like your 2000 kcal a day.

I understand you want to lose weight but make sure its for the right reasons. Lose weight to feel healthy, instead of just looking good. Running is a great way to lose weight because you work so many muscles, and swimming is another great way.<br>  Try to eat healthy, and avoid drinking soda. Try to drink water as much as possible because it cleanses your body and washes out any bad things in your body.<br>  Lastly, since you are still young your body is still growing. A lot of this excess weight it just baby fat, and will come off naturally with age. So eat well, exercise regularly and the pounds will melt off!<br>  good luck|`|NuWSKmBiaa	Okay, honestly, Nutrisystem is NOT the way to go. If you MUST go on a diet program choose Weight Watchers. Weight Watchers teaches your how to eat healthily in your day to day life, how to cook properly for yourself, and what to order when you go out, whereas Nutrisystem only sends you food, and all you can do is rely on that. With Nutrisystem, you're stuck in a cycle. You have to keep eating Nutrisystem, and if you try to go off that diet, you have no knowledge on how to eat healthy and will go right back to unhealthy eating habits. You should do what I do. I'm 15 years old, and what I did was I slowly weaned myself off unhealthy things in my diet. Like, for instance, every morning I used to have a HUGE banana-nut muffin. So one week, I just ate half, and two weeks later, I ate a quarter, until eventually I just didn't crave it anymore. Check the calorie content of the food you eat, but don't go crazy - don't count every single calorie you eat, because that will just drive you crazy and will probably lead to an eating disorder. And make sure if you do decided to diet that you don't completely cut fat or sugar out of your diet - that's just as unhealthy as having too much of it in your diet. Exercises-wise, a little cardio will go a long way. Go for a jog or a bike-ride or hop in a pool a few days a week. But also, don't count out muscle building activities, because they are just as important as the fat-burning exercises. <br>  I hope this helps!|`|BNhidacKaa	well...do more exercise and watch what you eat.

dzyJw0cvaa	First of all, the person with the cold sore shouldnt be trying to kiss someone else on the lips.  Thats like someone with a horrible cold trying to sneeze on someones face.  They are very contagious and once you have them, they never go away.  So, if this is someone that has kissed you before, simply tell them that when they have cold sores your lips are off limits!!  if the kiss comes comepltely unexpected, simply turn your head for a kiss on the cheak instead.  <br>  <br>  My ex husband suffered from cold sores and i never caught them from him, i wonder if i am immune to them because i still let him kiss me sometimes before we realized what he had was a cold sore. So maybe you could be one of the lucky immune ones too.  But i would say dont risk it.  They suck and they never go away.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I hope i helped!|`|b6pnN8Kqaa	Yes, it could be herpes.

In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain.

4t1k3mIyaa	yeahh this has happened to my mum and dieting. Its because when you start to loose weight, the weight shifts off radpidly because it is not use to the small food amount/exercise. But now, you body has come to the spot that it's just at a stand still. THIS IS NORMAL. I don't how long the stand still is meant to go on for, but keep doing it for a month and then another load of weight WILL come off. <br>  If you don't think that will work, up the amount of exercise you do if thats possible. Say if u do 30minutes. Try and do 45 instead. It makes a difference. Trying another exercise helps because your body starts to get adapted to the amount of calories you burn each time, meaning you will just maintain the weight and not loose any.Try doing a different kind. This will shock the body and make you burn more calories depending on the type of exercise. Cadio is the best to burn calories and fat. Do if do an hour of cardio exericse, 40 minutes of that is fat burning.. <br>  Wish u luck|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Your body becomes efficient at doing the exercise you do without burning nearly as many calories as wheen you started. Do another form of exercise. This is commonly known as a plateu. I hit one too :(.|`|OuTlT8f6aa	This is normal because you have burnt off all the excess weight you were carrying. It's harder to lose the weight because you are probably near your ideal weight now.<br>  Try a BMI calcualotr online to see if you are healthy<br>  Congrats on the weight loss :)

Trichomoniasis –Trich - may be acquired from infected shared water as in towels, group baths – Jacuzzis etc, – or as a sexually transmitted disease (STD). It is caused by the single-celled protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. The vagina is the most common site of infection in women, and the urethra is the most common site of infection in men. The parasite is sexually transmitted through penis-to-vagina intercourse or vulva-to-vulva contact with an infected partner. Women can acquire the disease from infected men or women, but men usually contract it only from infected women. Trichomoniasis is a common sexually transmitted disease that affects both women and men, although symptoms are more common in women. Trichomoniasis is the most common curable STD in young, sexually active women. The genital inflammation caused by trichomoniasis can increase a woman’s susceptibility to HIV infection if she is exposed to the virus. Having trichomoniasis may increase the chance that an HIV-infected woman passes HIV to her sex partner(s). Trichomoniasis can usually be cured with prescription drugs, either metronidazole or tinidazole, given by mouth in a single dose. The symptoms of trichomoniasis in infected men may disappear within a few weeks without treatment. However, an infected man, even a man who has never had symptoms or whose symptoms have stopped, can continue to infect or re-infect a female partner until he has been treated. Therefore, both partners should be treated at the same time to eliminate the parasite. Persons being treated for trichomoniasis should avoid sex until they and their sex partners complete treatment and have no symptoms. Metronidazole can be used by pregnant women. Having trichomoniasis once does not protect a person from getting it again. Following successful treatment, people can still be susceptible to re-infection.<br>  <br>  <br>  ALL ANSWERS SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED, IN ANY FORUM AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS ONE. -  MANY ANSWERS ARE FLAWED.<br>  <br>  <br>  The information provided here should not be used during any medical emergency or for the diagnosis or treatment of any medical condition.

13k2WKx8aa	There's no way to make it go away faster. Believe it or not, the only way it'll go away fast is to not give him anything at all.<br>  <br>  For you and your prevention, the only thing I can say is good hygiene practices (wash your hands with liquid soap and dry with paper towels), do the laundry, and keep the area clean and dust free. That'll help prevent you from getting a cold.<br>  <br>  Sounds simple, but really, that's about it. If you want, you could use Lysol and start spraying away on common surfaces. I'm not sure how effective it truly is for viruses . I know it destroys bacteria, bu I spray around with the stuff and I've still gotten colds. Those airborne bugs can be tricky!|`|Gou3a1yWaa	There is really no step by step explanation.  You can go to the drug store and get some Zicam.  The one that has a q-tip and you put it in your nose.

Your husband can use it to cure the cold and you can use it, just in case you might catch it.|`|f3cbb5ce9f2304adcda13ae360118e58aa	Mucinex is good for clearing the nose & chest congestion, try it.

Wash your hands a lot, and don't touch your eyes, nose, or mouth<br>  <br>  "Cure"<br>  Drink lots of liquids. A cold dehydrates you, so keep putting fluids in your body. Once, I had a cold, and I just drank water non-stop. I drank water until I had to pee, and when I was done, I would pee again. When I woke up in the morning, I felt great.<br>  <br>  Eat lots of soup, that helps with fluids. Vitamin C also helps

Y4s4Om38aa	You have a higher chance then someone with no close relitives with bipolar of developing it.   It does have a genetic link.....but its not as simple as genetic link for something like blue eyes or brown hair.  You could have the gene and it never end up being turned on.<br>  <br>  I don't know the numbers with bipolar, but schizophrania has a similar genetic linkage where it is complicated.

It is crazy how it all works out.|`|lk03YYPEaa	Bipolar disorder is NOT contagious; no mental disorders are.<br>  <br>  <br>  But as for the genetics part, this is what I found on wikipedia:<br>  <br>  Genetic studies have suggested many chromosomal regions and candidate genes appearing to relate to the development of bipolar disorder, but the results are not consistent and often not replicated.Although the first genetic linkage finding for mania was in 1969, the linkage studies have been inconsistent.[ (Genetic linkage studies may be followed by fine mapping searching for the phenomenon of linkage disequilibrium with a single gene, then DNA sequencing; using this approach causative DNA base pair changes have been reported for the genes P2RX7 and TPH1[citation needed]). Recent meta-analyses of linkage studies detected either no significant genome-wide findings or, using a different methodology, only two genome-wide significant peaks, on chromosome 6q and on 8q21. Genome-wide association studies have also not brought a consistent focus - each has identified new loci, while none of the previously identified loci were replicated. Findings did include a single nucleotide polymorphism in DGKH; a locus in a gene-rich region of high linkage disequilibrium (LD) on chromosome 16p12; and a single nucleotide polymorphism in MYO5B. A comparison of these studies, combined with a new study, suggested an association with ANK3 and CACNA1C, thought to be related to calcium and sodium voltage-gated ion channels. Diverse findings point strongly to heterogeneity, with different genes being implicated in different families.[60] Numerous specific studies find various specific links. Advanced parental age has been linked to a somewhat increased chance of bipolar disorder in offspring, consistent with a hypothesis of increased new genetic mutations. A review seeking to identify the more consistent findings suggested several genes related to serotonin (SLC6A4 and TPH2), dopamine (DRD4 and SLC6A3), glutamate (DAOA and DTNBP1), and cell growth and/or maintenance pathways (NRG1, DISC1 and BDNF), although noting a high risk of false positives in the published literature. It was also suggested that individual genes are likely to have only a small effect and to be involved in some aspect related to the disorder (and a broad range of "normal" human behavior) rather than the disorder per se.[|`|h7uxxiZZaa	It is genitic but it does not mean that you can get it like a cold. you may or may not ever get it. my mom and aunt have bipoalar but i dont have it. the doctors say yes any one can get it but itwss unlikely|`|yoVF60ORaa	highly contagious, and yes, I would suggest washing your jeans|`|U2lAi90Jaa	Truehope 1888truehope toll free 5 days a week free.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck......tell me how you doing.<br>  Source(s):<br>  my own suffered from bipolar and now Psych drug free after 25 years thanks to Truehope and I feel great.<br>  <br>  I take (1)Empower plus( High Mineral and vitamin) 20 caps a day... <br>  <br>  (2)Total Amino Solutions(great for with draw of meds ... you will have <br>  <br>  shakes and foggy heavy head and feel like death, weak until you take<br>  <br>  total aminos solutions 3 caps every two hrs 6 when you feel really<br>  <br>  bad.... sleep it off.)

tBF9VfPqaa	Some Herbst appliances are different. If you can take out the part that covers your lower teeth, then it is easy to clean.... just pop it out of your mouth brush with toothpaste and water... or you can brush it with some mouthwash. <br>  <br>  To brush the part that stays in your mouth, just make sure to get your toothbrush at every angle around the appliance to make sure nothing is caught in the back. Also, if you have a waterpik, that will help... if not just rinse with mouthwash very well. <br>  <br>  The best thing to do with eating is start out with soft foods. Mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, ice cream.... Those are all good to start out with and you can introduce more foods as you get used to it. It will probably take a good week to start getting used to having that in your mouth... but the more you try out and do the faster you will get used to it.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!!!

Eating 5-6 smaller, well balanced and healthy meals is ideal for your diet. Lots of fruits, grains and vegetables. No fatty foods, nothing full of carbs and "nothing that is full of nothing". <br>  <br>  As far as cardiovascular exercise goes -- this is what burns you fat. The body will burn and remove the excess adipose tissue in the places it needs to burn them. Continued exercise combined with proper diet will give you the results you're looking for.<br>  <br>  I always recommend that my clients take a daily multivitamin as well.
BNAzjSO1aa	Try eating plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables making sure you get plenty of vitamin C. Plenty of fluids to loosen the phlegm if it is very bad put ht water in a bowl and put your head over it covered with a towel and breathe in the steam or run a hot bath and breathe in the steam that way be careful not to burn yourself. Try to get plenty of rest as well. For your sore throat you might want to try honey and lemon juice mixed with hot water, and home made chicken soup has been shown to help some cold type illnesses. I personally am not to impressed with nasal rinsing but some people are but the zinc should help as well.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	wash your hands well, drink more water, treat your symptoms, use a nasal rinse, and suck on zinc lozenges.|`|OEaBSuaWaa	A nasal rinse is kinda like those nasal sprays.

VFhE8nBxaa	Kill the Bugs<br>  Lice can be killed quickly, easily, cheaply and safely with mayonnaise. Simply get a new jar of mayonnaise (not Miracle Whip) from your kitchen shelf or at the grocery store. (Don’t grab one from the refrigerator, as it will be way too cold.) Grab a handful (or several) and cover all of you child’s hair, being sure to get behind the ears and down the neck a little. You can cover this with a plastic shower cap to keep the mayonaise from dripping or getting onto your furniture. Leave the mayonnaise on for two hours to smother the lice and developed eggs. Then, remove the shower cap and throw it away, both of you wash your hands good with soap, and shampoo the hair thoroughly. It may take two or more shampoos to get the hair clean.<br>  <br>  You can use Vaseline if you don't have any mayonnaise. The only way to remove Vaseline from hair is to saturate the hair in baby oil, rub in through the hair completely, then squeeze out as much as you can. Then wash the hair three times with Dawn dish soap and hot water (not hot enough to burn!), each time leaving the dish soap on for a few minutes to allow it to work.<br>  <br>  Vaseline can be left on overnight if you wish, but this is not safe with mayonnaise because it turns poisonous when it is not refrigerated. Your child may scratch his head while sleeping and then put his fingers in his mouth.<br>  <br>  If you don’t trust the mayonnaise or Vaseline to smother the lice, you can make a natural lice shampoo to kill the lice but not poison your child. To a base of five teaspoons of Pure Olive Carrier Oil (or Pure Coconut Carrier Oil), add five drops of Tea Tree Essential Oil, five drops of Rosemary Essential Oil, five drops of Lavender Essential Oil, five drops of Peppermint Essential Oil, and five drops of Eucalyptus Essential Oil. Add a small amount of regular shampoo to the mixture, and put this all over the hair - all the way to the edges. Leave this on for an hour under a towel or tight-fitting shower cap to prevent drips. Rinse the hair, and shampoo the hair. (Olive oil and coconut oil kill lice by "dissolving" their exoskeletons, and other oils will not have the same effect.)<br>  <br>  Don't use a conditioner at this stage, but you will find that the hair is very easy to comb after using this oily mixture.            <br>  <br>  Notes: 1) The respiration of a baby or child under 5 can be slowed down or even stopped if peppermint oil or eucalyptus oil is close enough for the baby to even breathe either. 2) High blood pressure may be elevated by peppermint essential oil. 3) Peppermint or rosemary may be harmful during pregnancy. Just use the recipe without the oil that may be harmful in your case.<br>  <br>  Loosen the Eggs<br>  After shampooing, rinse the hair and scalp with vinegar. This loosens the glue that holds the nits onto the hair shafts. Rinse with hot water - but not so hot it that burns the child.<br>  <br>  Many of the nits (eggs) rinsed down the drain after the vinegar rinse. Now you have to deal with any nits that are left behind. The mayonnaise may not kill the newest nits since the unborn lice inside may have not yet developed enough to need air yet. Even if it did, schools and daycares will not allow children back in until the nits are removed.<br>  <br>  Get the Eggs Out<br>  Comb all of the tangles out of the hair with a regular comb, then comb the hair with a nit comb. You can buy this in the drug store, next to the lice shampoos.|`|BTI0XOptaa	The ONLY safe way to get rid of head lice permanently is to use a totally natural alternative to the chemical preparations then use prevention methods such as hairspray and tea tree mixed with water in a spray bottle every day to ensure they never return. <br>  <br>  You are right to want to stay away from chemical head lice treatments. Before you listen to anyone advising you to use a pesticide treatment please consider the following:<br>  <br>  No chemical head lice treatment is legally allowed to be labeled as 'safe' as every insecticide is a poison. Every pesticide preparation has the potential to do serious damage depending on the individual. If a lice treatment does not work once it is not going to work twice, in fact the lice that live will breed into a whole new batch that are resistant to that chemical.<br>  <br>  Luckily there are quite a few totally natural remedies available that readily kill head lice.<br>  <br>  Suffocation is an effective method where oil based products (i.e.: conditioner) are used to block the breathing holes and kill the live lice. The real trick though is to find natural products that will kill both the live lice and their eggs in one fast effective treatment.<br>  <br>  Remedies containing Neem Oil are known to be highly effective as Neem interrupts the growth and reproduction of the head louse. Neem’s insecticidal properties are widely recognized now and the oil is commonly available at your local health food store.<br>  <br>  Feel free to check out the articles at the following site for more advice.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|cKHhh0Ckaa	My mom used to use Lavender oil.

This is done because lice will not infest a body in this condition. This is an area that may take some explanation as my idea of a healthy body may not be exactly like the popular ideas in our society. <br>  <br>   Next – while beginning to produce this healthy body – focus on removing the lice infestation from the body.<br>  <br>   An infusion of :<br>  six parts hyssop, <br>  one part walnut leaves or inner bark, <br>  one half part cinnamon bark powder, <br>  one half part cloves powder,<br>   one half part lobelia and <br>  one half part ginger is used. <br>  <br>  The dose is: Orally, ? cup three times a day (adjust for age). Six days per week use a fomentation of the same infusion over the affected areas. If the head is affected, use a rubber cap at night to keep the fomentation in place. Repeat as many weeks as necessary.<br>  <br>  <br>   Last focus on the environment of the home.  Change the bed linens and clothing daily. Wash in a biodegradable soap and add at least a cup of apple cider vinegar to each washer load. The room, too, needs attention. Make a tea of six parts chaparral, three parts black walnut leaf or bark, one part lobelia with and spray the room. For fragrance some mint or lavender may be added. <br>  <br>  I realize that this is pretty overwhelming if you are looking for a simple solution. Unfortunately, it is necessary to address all these areas to really get rid of the problem and to prevent recurrence. <br>  <br>  Feel free to contact to get further explanation of this procedure or to ask other questions. <br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  Jim Spalding|`|lFLsbDZxaa	What my mother always did to me, because we never had enough money to buy fancy shampoos and such, is poor mayonnaise into my hair and wrapped it in a plastic bag.<br>  <br>  It stunk horribly, and would cause irritation or the scalp, but it worked wonders.<br>  <br>  Another remedy that she would use, that worked just as well, caused less irritation, and smelled much better, was olive oil.<br>  <br>  Same concept of the mayonnaise, put a bag over the hair, leave it in for a couple of hours and BAM!

Rk46lIBwaa	Rhianna pointed me to your question, however despite my paediatric background, which is a bit rusty, I struggled to come up with diagnostic suggestions. If your CRT is accurate it is 5x normal. If only one hand is cyanosed and you are sure there is no other peripheral cyanosis, it suggests a localised cause.<br>  <br>  You don't say whether your paediatric consultant is a generalist or a specialist, not do you comment on your babes general condition, so I assume it is generally good.<br>  <br>  I am afraid with the relatively small amount of information available I can't even suggest a diagnosis, especially since the 'on the spot' paediatrician has not managed one.<br>  <br>  Let us know if you can add any more detail. I home that you are able to clarify what is going on soon.<br>  <br>  The generalised peripheral cyanosis is much more common. ( I spent quite a long time racking my brains and the medical databases trying to explain the single hand!) <br>  <br>  I would have thought despite his normal heart sounds at least a scan would be indicated. All the congenital heart and vascular abnormalities do need to be excluded.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	The normal CRT is between 2-4 seconds. In babies, the best method is to press on the sternum for 4 seconds until the area goes white, then time how long it takes for the colour to return once pressure is released- do not do this if you are not medically qualified, it does not take much to cause damage or break the sternum . <br>  <br>  10 seconds means that it takes an abnormal amount of time for the blood to refill empty capillaries, indicating poor peripheral perfusion- the cause for this needs to be investigated further, this is worrying. If he has cyanosis, clearly something is not right. Which tests have they done so far? This could be the result of a respiratory issue, rather than cardiac one.<br>  <br>  If you leave this question open, I'll ask Dr Frank, he comes from a paediatric background.|`|Gd6CsEAbaa	I would recommend and echocardiogram, the heart circulates the blood and the blood circulates oxygen.  A lack of oxygen can cause cyanosis (blue color to lips, fingers, toes etc ... ) It could be nothing but just to be safe i would recommend a cardiac echo.  Painless ultrasound of the heart.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  <br>  Hope the little guy is Ok.

tGEMwgyBaa	You may be grinding your teeth at night, the next time you wake up, take notice is your jaw hurts as well, it's not normal for your teeth to hurt for no apparent reason, it's your body telling you something is wrong. If you don't know if you are grinding at night, ask someone to check in on you or if you have a recorder, record yourself sleeping...but beware...you might find out that you talk in your sleep as well! If you have a lot of stress going on right now, it will play out in your sleep with vivid dreams or grinding your teeth.This should be a good start to finding out why your teeth are sore. Good Luck!|`|Snwfwx73aa	I don't think its anything to be worried about, you could just have sensitive teeth, but should it continue over a longer period, not problem having it checked out :)
RPdtHKk5aa	I had this same thing happen to me in middle school - one of my friends was taking too many sleeping pills.  I told the school counselor, and my friend got mad at me but eventually forgave me. It is very unhealthy what she is doing, if she is a good friend she will see that you were just trying to help. If she doesn't forgive you, she's not someone you should be hanging around with. You sound like a really good friend, you should have others in your life who are just as good to you. <br>  Go talk to your counselor, or a teacher that you trust.|`|dzyJw0cvaa	Yes she is going to have severe issues from this.  She is going to kill her kidneys because advil is VERY hard on them.  Tell someone, she needs help.  if she ditches you as a friend, then she isnt a good friend anyway and she will no longer be your problem.  But while you are still in her life, you need to be a good friend and get her help.  Thats what a good friend does!<br>  <br>  Good luck.
DwsHXG30aa	As the first person said "you can't control it" but i once asked my doctor this very question and he said to help "maintain a dry underarm, put deoderant on before you go to bed, then again when you wake up"<br>  hope that helps.<br>  =)|`|i4nwHekGaa	talcum powder works, just put it on before you go out|`|CBgDc1Auaa	Unfortunately buddy, you can't... it's your bodies reaction to heat... everyone has their own and different sweating system... your hypothalimus located in the brain determins how hot your body is, kind of like a thermomiter. <br>  <br>  anyway, when you sweat profusely, it means that you need to think about one things... replacing that fluid by drinking water...<br>  <br>  if you want to sweat less, you can use salt pills, or just eat some salt, as salt retains water in the body... however, it is recommended that you just let your body do what it's gonna do... wear more deoderant and don't be ashamed to use a towel to wipe your pits once in a while...<br>  <br>  its better than looking like you broke water baloons under your arms...aye?<br>  <br>  PS... don't go to the doctor... they'll give you salt pills... and charge you out the @#% for them... just eat salty stuff!|`|AA11065140	You probably can't, and you probably shouldn't.  I know that's not what you wanted to hear, but the truth of the matter is that sweating is one of the body's methods for eliminating toxins.  It's actually good for you to sweat.<br>  <br>  That said, I know from personal experience that it's embarrassing - especially at your age.  You might try wearing a light-weight t-shirt under your regular shirt...that will help with absorption.  Additionally, stop in the restroom between classes, if you can, to apply another coat of deodorant, or even use baby wipes to clean up during your breaks.|`|4MTzp8hMaa	Well here is a long shot..<br>  <br>  1.)

Some people just have more sweat glands than others.|`|ERx11AsCaa	Being 14 you are at an age where your starting to mature and your hormones are most likely unbalanced. You may be producing a lot of testosterone which is helping your body grow. The unbalance is partly to blame for the excess sweating.<br>  <br>  If you ask any of your male friends around your age they may be suffering from the same excess sweating especially under the arms.<br>  <br>  Antiperspirants are the best thing to try as they are aluminum based. The aluminium blokes the sweat pores under the arms to help reduce the sweat. Less sweat to hit the bacteria on your skin the less smell.<br>  <br>  Also the stain is caused by the acidity of the antiperspirant. Roll on and sticks are the worst for causing stains. <br>  <br>  When you apply any antiperspirant under your arm make sure to use just a small amount and make sure it dries before you put your clothes on. <br>  <br>  Wash or soak you shirts in cold water and laundry soaker and spray under the arms with a stain remover should do the trick.<br>  <br>  Also your sweating should go back to normal within a year when your hormones balance themselves out.|`|RKoMl7xSaa	If you have excess sweating go to your doctor and they can prescribe a tablet to help control and minimise the sweating.<br>  <br>  you can get botox in the armpit which minimises the amount of sweating<br>  <br>  make sure you use an anti-perspirant deoderant and you may need to re-apply throughout the day.<br>  <br>  Good luck..|`|hXbbXt27aa	I too had the same Problem until I found Maxim anti-perspriant <br>  this stuff is awsome!!!

Perhaps you are touching your teeth with your tongue and the bad breath is being transferred from your tongue to your teeth.  Look at the top of your tongue for some white stuff.  That is the bacteria and this must be removed in order to get rid of bad breath.  I use a very good tongue cleaner, called OraBrush.  Here is their web site if you are interested:<br>  http;//www.orabrush.com|`|ffpdB1tzaa	Having smelly areas between your teeth is caused by a buildup of plaque in that area.  Floss once in the morning and once at night.  You want to get just slightly below the gumline, but not horribly deep.  There may be a small amount of blood on the dental floss afterwards, but it's okay if it's just a small amount.  I know if I miss a few days of flossing, the plaque has a slight unpleasant smell.  <br>  <br>  It may also help to make a dental appointment and get a cleaning done by a hygienist.  The ADA recommends you do this twice per year.  You could also have tarter that is allowing germs to build up which is causing the smell.  <br>  <br>  If you have very sore gums or bleeding when you brush your teeth, you may have gingivitis or peridontal disease.  These situations are helped by regular cleaning, but your dentist may suggest something else.|`|1gvney5jaa	You should be using dental floss also after brushing.  Then use a plaque removing mouthwash.  If that doesn't work you definitely need to see your dentist!|`|dgCbGHvNaa	floss and mouthwash chew minty gum go to dentist tell them ur problem switch toothpaste

3c90ab9bfffe34bff700221249b00257aa	CMV is in the herpes family of viruses, as are Epstein-Barr Virus (which causes mono) Varicella-Zoster Virus (which causes chicken pox and shingles) and Herpes Simplex I and II (which cause cold sores and genital herpes). Although they're in the same family, they are quite different viruses.<br>  <br>  All of these viruses are very common: most adults, for example carry both EBV and CMV, and most have at least one of the herpes simplex viruses.<br>  <br>  Only a minority of people who get EBV or CMV ever get any symptoms, which typically are mono-like, sometimes with a mild hepatitis (inflammation of the liver). CMV can be a more serious infection for people with severe immune suppression, like in AIDS, or for pregnant women as it can cause fetal abnormalities.<br>  <br>  At the age of 16 you may well have CMV or EBV or one of the herpes simplex viruses because they are very common, and so might your friend. However, you can't say whether any of these are the cause of your friend's symptoms without her having tests to check for new infection: lots of different viruses cause sore throats and even "mono-like" illnesses.

pqnEavSyaa	Common causes of heel and arch pain are plantar fasciitis and heel spurs.<br>  <br>  Plantar Fasciitis is a painful inflammatory condition causing heel pain and in some people, heel spurs. Plantar Fasciitis is often caused by abnormal pronation of the foot and improper arch support. Contributing factors are weight gain, intense physical activity, jobs that require a lot of walking or standing on hard surfaces, or shoes with poor arch support.<br>  <br>  A heel spur is a bony growth on the heel bone (calcaneus). Heel spurs can cause sharp foot pain at the bottom or front of the heel bone. Heel spurs and heel pain can be caused by plantar fasciitis. Continuous pulling of the fascia at the heel bone eventually leads to the development of this painful bony growth on the heel.<br>  Research has found that a combination of proper exercises and arch support by wearing orthotic insoles can provide effective relief for this type of condition.<br>  <br>  You can find more information on heel spurs and orthotics at the links below:|`|fRQHpKCPaa	You should always do a 10 min stretch prior to running, if thers pain in your arch or heel you probably need to get some nice running pads. Usually Big 5 has insets from 12-19 dollars. Ulitmately without proper padding or shoes you will feel lower back pain. *Good Luck*

No one stops us to have a good girl friend. Its fine if you don't a girl friend till now but now that you feel like hanging around with a friend who will soothe your feelings and be by your side in times of crisis, you ought to make a girl friend.<br>  Girls will be your friend if you possessive some skills, talents, charm in you (am sure you have them all). Girls want to be secured with the man they be friends with. Some men are in such a great rush to make girl friends that they need to realise that if we approach girls with the intention of taking them out for a coffee or pub the very first meeting, it all gets ruined there. If you know a girl whom you can be friends, you need to have the RIGHT approach towards getting friendly to her. It should not happen that she is already friends with another guy so this much spade work is your duty. Make attemps to meet here and share her feelings as all human beings have feelings to be vented out. Do dwell upon her likes and not yours as you are 'in need of a girl'. Be very polite to her and give her enough cofidence in you that she is with a decent guy like you. Don't be in a mad rush to meet her when she is self occupied on a particular day. <br>  Don't (for heavens sake) hint at her that your interest lies in the bed as all women have dignity and won't be appreciable at all. Its a fact so no point feeling bad what I just wrote. Make her comfortable all the time..<br>  Brother Blogger, its MAGIC. You will get a girl friend within days from now..All the best: Leme know your experience !!

It builds immunity to every new pathogen it experiences and kills. Although, even if you did get the same exact pathogen (which would never happen), you wouldn't really be able to tell.... the numerous amounts of rhinoviruses out there leaves it impossible to tell which causes exactly what symptoms.

XRdOfOn6aa	You can get drunk for sure... but alcohol may have side effects that are probably a bit more dangerous for a person with Addison's than the normal person. One drink should not be an issue as long as the person drinks plenty of other fluids. Getting plastered, well...<br>  First, you get dehydrated which is not good as it may interfere with the electrolyte levels and as you should know, the adrenal crisis is created when sodium and potassium levels go out of wack. Which is why you want to stay hydrated and have a high sodium diet.<br>  Second, if you get drunk and start to vomit - that also can create a life threatening crisis. <br>  So, moderation is probably ok - but overdoing it can be dangerous especially if the people around you do not understand your health issues.|`|0rpN2419aa	What Jen said is very accurate and you will be okay if you do as she reccomended.  I too, have Addison's disease, but I don't drink alcohol, because throwing up with a hangover is very serious.  Give her a thumbs up and please be very careful.  Jen is very knowledgable about this condition we have and it can be very serious if we don't take care of ourselves.  She deserves a best answer!!!  An occasional little drink here or there won't hurt you, just getting drunk is unsafe.
AA12358000	Halo H,<br>  The symptoms that you describe are similar to those that present in vitiligo, which is the loss of skin pigment. Skin gets its colour from pigment cells known as melanocytes. When those cells are damaged or destroyed, they can no longer produce pigment, causing white or colourless spots to appear. The spots can grow larger over time and eventually blend together so that large portions of the skin have no colour. While no one knows why this occurs, many experts suspect it is related to problems within the autoimmune system. There is also some evidence of links to heredity. People of any skin colour can develop vitiligo, but it's most obvious on dark skin. It commonly occurs on the hands, face, upper chest, around body openings - like eyes and nose, in body folds - like armpits and groin, or at the site of an injury. When vitiligo impacts the hair, premature gray is the result. One common treatment is PUVA -- a kind of "repigmentation" therapy involving the drug psoralen, and exposure to UV light. This can help increase the amount of melanocyte cells at the skin's surface. Other treatments include prescription-strength corticosteroid cream, light/laser treatments, and, in rare instances, skin grafting.<br>  <br>  <br>  ALL ANSWERS SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED, IN ANY FORUM AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS ONE. -  MANY ANSWERS ARE FLAWED.<br>  <br>  <br>  The information provided here should not be used during any medical emergency or for the diagnosis or treatment of any medical condition.

VFhE8nBxaa	The EVLT? procedure is a minimally invasive laser procedure in treating varicose veins without scarring. The laser energy minimizes the vein walls, shrinking them and closing the faulty vein so that the blood cannot flow through it. This eliminates the bulging of the vein at its source. After the treatment, the blood in the faulty veins will be diverted to the many normal veins in the leg.<br>  <br>  The procedure takes about 45 minutes with local anesthetic and is done on an outpatient procedure basis.<br>  <br>  Risks and Potential Complications<br>  As with any invasive procedure, there are potential complications. These rare complications include:<br>  <br>  there may be mild numbness around the thigh area <br>  there may be a pulling sensation which may last a week <br>  Phlebitis (redness and tenderness of the skin is quite common but is mild in nature and easily treated with over the counter pain medications. Most cases of phlebitis resolve in 3-7 days. <br>  Deep venous thrombosis. This is a very rare complications following Endovenous Laser Ablation. The best way to prevent this rare complication is to wear compression bandage or compression stocking and to walk right after the procedure. <br>  Infection at an incision site is a rare occurrence and usually resolves on its own. <br>  Bruising is a common feature after the procedure. The bruising is mild and resolves in a week. <br>  Failure of the procedure does occur and may be related to the inability to place the probe in the vein. This does happen rarely. Other causes of failure are the inability of the laser to destroy the vein. The majority of technical failures are related to inexperience of the physician with the procedure
AA12240972	At this point I think it would be in your best interest to see a dietician.  There are some super good website about good carbs and so forth.

P7rosHBNaa	Try Scar Zone, It's only $10 and works great|`|d3VV4b6vaa	I know why. This happened to me too. your skin has become dependant on these synthetic products and ingredients.  that what happens when you don't use natural. natural products support your body's own moisture system, and synthetic destroys it. do not scrub aaway, you're just causing your skin to shed even more, resulting in even drier skin. its a vicious cycle and the only way to break from is it to return to a natural state.  its not expensive at all. buy some almond oil or coconut oil, shea butter, cocoa butter etc...as these are the best of the best on skin care. they won't clog pores, they'll speed up healing, remove old scars AND cure your dryness.<br>  also, top, splashing your face with water (especialy hard water>, this actually causes a lot of skin dehydration

Make sure you use a pure whey protein with No artificial Sweeteners, No artificial Flavors, No artificial Fillers etc.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buybulkwhey.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.buybulkwhey.com/</a><br>  <br>  These guys sell the highest quality and best priced pure whey protein.|`|CbEQWZ4haa	i pretty sure it will still be<br>  go0d but to make sure maybe<br>  yew should smell it or tell someone<br>  taste it for yew..........=D
GcWRPLd6aa	Carbs come from 3 different sources - glucose or fructose (simple sugars), starches, and fiber. it's best to  get your carbs from fiber rich foods which have less sugars.|`|gOwakeM1aa	Healthy carbohydrates are those that are low in producing insoline.  Some of these healthy carbs are spinach, broccoli, blueberries, and black beans.<br>   Healthy sugars are to be used in small amounts and some of them are, raw honey, maple sugar and raw cane sugar.
mPTBU0QDaa	Don't talk at all. Save your voice for the show. Seriously, no talking!<br>  <br>  Also, drink LOTS of fluids. Things like hot water with honey and lemon and a little cayenne pepper mixed in will help the cough go away.<br>  <br>  Right before the show, you could take a shot of olive oil or brandy.|`|Drb9EP5Kaa	honey helps me a lot. Also drinking chicken soup works too(make sure there's more fat/oil in the soup)

c0a5c8943ce6f1d0df1e342f2f780150aa	We have a large nerve bundle that runs from our hips to our heels. It is contained in a cartilage "tunnel" in the pelvic bone. Any sort of trauma from falling to pregnancy can bust open that "tunnel." There is no cure. When the weather is damp (low pressure system) it makes it even worse (pain). Sometimes a chiropractor can help the worst of the pain, and maybe acupuncture but I don't believe it. It is something we have to suffer with the rest of our lives. : (|`|QXcp7vnCaa	you should talk to your doctor.|`|HzM5Sqoraa	I am going through the same thing.  but now its in both legs.  i take aleve for the swelling and lots of walking.  there are exercises that you can do on a daily basis, seems to help if you stay <br>  commited.  good luck,  as i can feel your pain.
fZmvWv7qaa	OK first...There are huge major arteries going into the kidneys.  If your son "ruptured" or shattered his kidney, he would've been stone dead by the time you even got him in the car, much less got to the emergency room.  <br>  <br>  Second...You took him to the ER for a fall, and they examined his KIDNEY values?   There's a huge part of the story missing, it sounds like.<br>  <br>  and last, ..people fall DOWN the stairs.|`|HD29O7Ataa	How do you fall UP stairs?|`|lTNcvqyHaa	Yes - I would be very concerned. <br>  Did the Emergency Department offer you a referral to a Renal Specialist. You son needs specialist medical attention. If the kidney fails he will need to have it removed.<br>  The specialist will be able to fully investigate the damage and/or ? disease. The cause should be fully investigated.<br>  Usually when kidneys are damaged in an accident of some kind, it is because they have sustained a damage which is significant enough to cause bleeding, bruising (internal and visible around the area) this is usually associated with severe pain, low blood pressure as the body goes into shock - this is a medical emergency.<br>  <br>  Please get a referral to see a Renal Specialist ASAP and you can discuss the possible causes with him/her.|`|VlxjNzgtaa	Well, I do know that when people get into severe car accidents they can damage their insides to the point where they either rip off or get damaged and bruised. I do think that this shed falling on your son is probably the reason for his kidney problem because a young person usually shouldn't have such a problem unless of some accident. <br>  Good luck and I hope your son gets better.|`|AA11612196	yes i think so> i know that if you get punched in the kidney it can> i learned that in cj! is he alright?

K2QwEM4raa	Very much sounds like the FLU. You do not take antibiotics for the flu because it is caused by a virus and it will not work for viruses. Best thing to do is get the flu shot each year. And if you have the flu you will get better. Most people just need to take it easy for a few days. Unless you have other serious health problems.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Flu. Call your doctor because you're going to need antibiotics to cover that green mucous.<br>  In the meantime keep yourself hydrated, get plenty of rest and take aspirin or tylenol for aches and pains.|`|2Y0WXtyNaa	Aside from fever it has all the symptoms of flu. Take some head cold or head decongestant Tylenol|`|Mqhbooqzaa	You have the Flu.

Just get well first..k..|`|USoqyjaAaa	No, it is actually against the law for food handlers to work with these symptoms, at least in my state. And you shouldn't anyway.  You could spread the illness.|`|OJQqbIu4aa	was this a serious question?<br>  no you cant|`|kC7U3VK8aa	Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Hq6nSl1Qaa	No.  Lactose is a sugar.  It is present in relatively high doses in milk.  Soy does not have any appreciable amounts of lactose.<br>  <br>  And contrary to popular believe, "lactose free" milk still has small amounts of lactose.  The manufacturers add an enzyme that converts lactose into usable sugars for "lactose-intolerant" individuals.  This is not done to 100% completion, but instead to a lactose concentration that won't result in "lactose intolerant" symptoms by sufferers.  By the same token, most cheese has the lactose consumed by the bacteria, so it too is low in lactose.  So, if your drink says "lactose free", than the milked used has been treated with the enzyme.|`|JhJXKRkOaa	lactose free mean no dairy, people who are lactose intolerant can't have milk, butter, yogurt, cream, anything with a huge amount of dairy products in, my brother, when he was a baby was lactose intolerant, he had milk before we new about it and he kept throwing it back up, all of it not just some of it, he then had to have powdered milk, think it called SMA baby formula milk. he's now thirteen and think he's grown out of it, either that or he doesn't eat alot of dairy products. our dad couldn't eat dairy products, gave him an upset stomach and he was sick if he had to much, it was bad because he loved cream on desserts, he had about half a tablespoon of cream, that helped him, only having a tiny amount.<br>  <br>  I'm not a dairy fan, I don't like milk or cream that much, but I have milk in tea and with cereal, if i drank milk as a drink, I'd probably be sick but I don't think I'm lactose intolerant.|`|WadzK6ejaa	It is vegetables milk made from soya beans not animal milk that contain lactose|`|e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	It means the lactose has been removed.  Lactose is milk sugar.  Many people are lactose intolerant so they remove it and replace with a different type of sugar.<br>  <br>  There is lactose-free cow's milk.  It's called Lactaid.

PGkR813Jaa	You can have a pap smear at any age.<br>  <br>  If you have had sex then you need to have a pap smear.<br>  <br>  It is recommended that as soon as a girl or woman becomes sexually active that they have one.<br>  <br>  So yes. Go and get yourself one.<br>  <br>  The chances of you having cervical cancer at this age is low. But you need to have the smear to test for genital warts which can cause cervical cell changes.<br>  <br>  PLEASE start making him wear a condom.<br>  Take some responsibility. Your old enough.|`|lQ3uor3jaa	You should definitely get a pap smear, and a round of STD tests from your gynecologist. USE CONDOMS, it will save you a lot of trouble and worry. At least you are on birth control though......<br>  <br>  A Pap Smear would check for HPV. Your doctor will scrape cells off your cervix and get them tested. There are many many many different strands of HPV, some which can turn into cancer. With all the unprotected sex it is likely you may have picked some strand of HPV up.... It is very very common. Don't worry too much about it, just talk to your doctor. <br>  <br>  And don't listen to the person above me that says wait until your 25... You get them once a year (unless your doctor tells you different) and you should start getting them once you become sexually active.... Or start your period.....<br>  <br>  Maybe you would find this site helpful.<br>  <a href="http://www.avert.org/yngindx.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.avert.org/yngindx.htm</a>|`|AA11311516	first off, stop worrying. Even if there is something negative to be found it is easily taken care of as long as you catch it asap and follow your dr's recommendations. <br>  <br>  Go get a pap and discuss your concerns with your dr.|`|xreWOKBYaa	The shot is called guardacil, it prevents a FEW (not all) strains of HPV the virus that is the leading cause of cervical cancer. Men are carriers of HPV and have no symptions - so there is no way of knowing if a man has one or not. Go to your obgyn and get a pap done and they will tell you if any abnormal (cancer) cells were found on your cervix. You should always use condoms, and at 17 you should not have any sexual parteners let alone MANY. If you are sexually active you should be seeing your gyno once a year, and it doesnt matter if you are 17. You should tell them the truth about your sexual history and get a full std screen. Most ogbyn visits are covered on your insurance, which im guessing you had to go to one already to get your birth control. Most highschools and clinics give out free condoms every day, you just have to go and ask.|`|hE6Z93Ysaa	I had cervical cancer.  As far as I know there isn't any test other than a pap smear.  Then when it come back abnormal they will have to do alot of tests to see what the problem is.  If you think you have it, you should see a gynecological oncologist.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	the pill doesn't protect you from std's...ya you need to go to your ob/gyn and get tested...you're not having safe sex...|`|edCUawppaa	Yes, a Pap Smear.|`|ZWyO9t7Caa	Yes, go to your GP and either get a pap smear performed there or get referred to a gynaecologist for a pap smear.  I personally would recommend seeing a gyno as they tend to have more experience.  You can get a pap smear done at any age and at 17 you should be covered by privacy legislation so your parents do not need to know.  If you don't feel comfortable going to a GP there are sexual health clinics that you can go to.  For information on their services I suggest seeking assistance from your school/college counsellers.  Alternatively, look up youth services in your local phone book.|`|Ff15178saa	you can definitely get the test done it is done with a routine pap smear test but depending on what state/country you live in it is different some do it as a routine and others do it on request only but given your information that you provided your dr will be more concerned tp check for all stds ,, you might get some not polite answers here from ppl ,, but i highly recommend using condoms until you get married if any man saz he dont like them or babe it just dont feel the same or babe i ll pull out on time-1. dont trust them at your age are they gonna be around to be daddy 2. you dont know if they have a std<br>  3. a woman should respect her body more then some guy who cant  where a life jacket before he goes swimming.<br>  4. get the i wanna be one less  one less shot -given to females to protect hpv  from ages 9-i think 28 good luck<br>       LIFE JACKET|`|heziH5K4aa	Go to your local health clinic (its usually free or very low cost) and ask if you can get scheduled for a pap smear (and some birth control, too if you aren't already on it). They will scrape the inside of your cervix to check for cervical cancer, gonorrhea, and chlamydia.|`|Y6YrRo7Uaa	YES. If you are on birth control and your doctor knows that you have sexual partners, than im surprised that she hasn't already checked you. I am 18 and I have already had 3 pap smears, so whoever said it was 25 lied. Just make an appointment with a registered doctor that has been trained to do them.|`|9EKecl3Daa	Call your doctors office and tell them you want a pap smear. Tell them you are sexually active and would like to have one. I highly doubt you have cancer, but your doc or OBGYN should be happy to give you a pap.|`|03rggPF2aa	yes, you have to a year after you become sexually active.|`|a93da064b9ad5aa87707eafa3fe3d894aa	O of course you can. Just go to your gyno.|`|ZAfqTQymaa	If you visit your doctor and explain this, I'm sure he will oblige. Having said this, you should also consider getting info on sexually transmitted infections, which the pill won't keep you safe from.  it's also worth noting that cervical cancer can result from STI's, specifically the HPV virus.  <br>  <br>  If you are worried, I strongly suggest you see your doctor
nF0Eaa2Gaa	Trich can be passed also by sharing clothing such as underwear or using someone else's towel. But it's mainly passed through sexual contact whether it's mutual masturbation or direct sex.<br>  <br>  If you have it then your BF will need to be treated also because men carry it without symptoms. He can give it back to you after you finish treatment if he doesn't get treatment too.|`|VFhE8nBxaa	As far as wanting to know if he cheated.Unless he claims you are the only one he's ever been with then there is a chance he could have gotten this from another girl before you. Guys are just carriers and have no affect by this at all, however you both need to be treated for this now not just you because you'll just continue to have this std if you don't. <br>  <br>  Trich is easily passed between sex partners — same-sex as well as opposite-sex partners. It is spread through vaginal intercourse, sharing sex toys, and mutual masturbation if fluids from one partner are passed to the genitals of the other. So even if you have used condoms unless he had them on his fingers/mouth and same for you more than likely this is how you got it. <br>  <br>  What is trichomoniasis and how do you get it?<br>  Trichomoniasis (pronounced trih-kuh-muh-nye-uh-sus), also called “trick,” is a sexually transmitted disease (STD). It is caused by a parasite that can be passed from one person to another. The parasite is sexually transmitted through penis-to-vagina intercourse or vulva-to-vulva contact with an infected partner. The vulva is the genital area outside the vagina. Women can get the disease from infected men or women. <br>  <br>  While trichomoniasis is usually passed sexually, it may be picked up from contact with damp or moist objects such as towels, wet clothing, or a toilet seat, if the genital area gets in contact with these damp or moist objects|`|ow7eECNAaa	u only can get that std from from not usein a comdoms maybe yo boyfriend been had it an didnt kno men has no sign that they have it so they will never know....  same sitch here
I08iONdaaa	There is a very high chance that you're pregnant. Taking Plan B with birth control actually increases the chance of pregnancy, or so my friend who got pregnant told me. Also, the pulling out method is pretty ineffective in general. You're also supposed to wait  a couple weeks to allow your hormone cycles to kick in with the BC before you have sex. <br>  <br>  I would say, given that information you are probably pregnant.|`|Zcx9JOGXaa	sound like you were on your period right? the possibility is slim to none of you being pregnant|`|qfSKgxDsaa	even if he pulled out before he "went" this isn't safe!  There is pre-ejaculation sperm and that's enough to get pregnant.  You need to be on your birth control for at least a week for it to be affective but since you took the plan b pill you should be good.  You could get a test to be sure.|`|Y6YrRo7Uaa	From the information here I don't see it possible that you are pregnant. how long ago was your period? by what it says here, you were on your period when you two were intimate? If so, then pregnancy isn't much of a possibility.|`|hBW9vnB0aa	You should be more grown up and more responsible with the choices you make.|`|ORUAtr0kaa	Tip: pulling. out. doesn't. work. <br>  :/ other then that I don't know.|`|7yAz7dK9aa	Even though you would need at least seven consecutive birth control pills to be protected from that standpoint, you were protected by the Plan B (as long as you took it within the 72 hour window). <br>  <br>  Plan B is, basically, a giant birth control pill. Meaning that it will prevent you from ovulating if you take it as directed. <br>  <br>  Also, getting pregnant while on your period, is possible, although it is very, very rare.<br>  <br>  There is this sight called VaginaPagina (www.vaginapagina.com) based off Livejournal. It's an amazing place for things like this. They are very welcoming and full of facts. I suggest stopping by there and taking a peek. <br>  <br>  Also, they will never judge you on the decisions you make about your sex life. Accidents happen. <br>  <br>  Anyway, it would be very unlikely that you conceived.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|yQ0ATaccaa	i don't think your prego because Birth control does that. If you are worried pick up two pregnancy test and see what happens. Good LUck<br>  I'm catholic to i'll pray for you|`|a93da064b9ad5aa87707eafa3fe3d894aa	If you were to be pregnant you would be knowing this soon anyways.

mlaLgoaSaa	maybe about 5 lbs.. but, it will all be water weight, and the moment you start eating again, all the weight you lost will return, and maybe more. also, expect to experience nausea, headaches, fatigue, muscle aches, difficulty sleeping, constipation, and maybe more unpleasant side effects...|`|SsB7aRExaa	Almost none.  The scale will show less weight simply because your bowels empty out.  That's it.  You won't lose fat.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	1-2 pounds maybe a little more. your body if being starved will go into panic mode and think its being starved therefore will use the fat already in your body to compensate and you will weigh in more|`|F1oGer5Haa	Uh, if you're doing this solely to lose weight (not religious reasons), this is kind of unhealthy. Your body will know you are trying to starve yourself, and will hold tightly onto calories and fat, making it harder to lose than if you ate.<br>  <br>  Plus, you are going to be in torture when you do this, and I personally don't think you are physically capable of handling so long a fast without being in pain. But if you are, I guess I can't stop you. Don't be surprised if you don't lose anything!<br>  <br>  Seriously, I would not do this for the sole purpose of losing weight.|`|zeZtFbGjaa	Im a former bulimic (ya i know) but im recovered now and very healthy and thats the most stupid thing u cud do<br>  <br>  Here's sum simple tips besides the obvious of pills, exercises and eating healthy<br>  <br>  I used to eat from paper plates/napkins to absorbs any extra oils or fats<br>  <br>  take a multivitamin, to make sure you ain't missing out on Essential nutrients<br>  <br>  eat plenty of chili as it increases your metabolism<br>  <br>  Give yourself treats as rewards eg a facial<br>  <br>  water before meals to fill you<br>  <br>  drink iced water as ur body uses Cal's to warm it up<br>  <br>  eating celery burns more cals, dan whats in d actual celery stick<br>  <br>  Eat small portions regulary<br>  <br>  Eat from a small plate, wit a small spoon, and put in down between mouthfuls, and not in front of the tv, tricks your mind you've eaten loads<br>  <br>  Good Luck and remember be healthy!|`|RW6YWEc2aa	i guarantee by the second day you'll end up binge eating. <br>  But i guess that doesn't matter, just as long as you're getting thinner, everythings fine :D|`|Paec2Mkkaa	it would depend on your weight just now, but you wont notice much of a difference! i wouldnt advise it!! just eat well an exersise!
RXI8ImdIaa	This is completely normal. You might be biting a little too hard, but even with the correct pressure you are going to experience some pain for a while.<br>  <br>  Over time you will build up a tough spot there. You won't be able to feel it like finger callouses, but it just won't hurt so much.<br>  <br>  In the meantime if you really can't stand the pain, you can try getting some *denture pads*. These are wax-coated strips of fabric, in the shape of your gums. They are meant to go underneath dentures to cushion the gums.<br>  <br>  You can cut off a piece of one of those things, wide enough to cover your 4 front lower teeth. Fold it over your teeth while you play saxophone.<br>  <br>  This will not eliminate the pain completely but it might help a little bit. Your ultimate goal should be playing without pain, without the pads. You might want to look for professional, private lessons if you are serious about the saxophone.<br>  <br>  Edit: someone above me is describing a "double lip" embouchure, I forgot about that. It's frequently used by european musicians. In the USA we teach single-lip style, which is easier to master but has the side effect of biting the lower lip.|`|lgg7DLy9aa	It's pretty normal to have this happen if you are playing for a long time, even with a correct embouchure. If it happens quickly, you are probably biting down too hard, but after an hour or so of strait playing, this happens to people with perfectly fine embouchure. <br>  <br>  So just try to take breaks more often an make sure you are not biting and see if that helps.|`|G3hTM9qeaa	No it's not normal. You don't want to be biting down on the mouthpiece with your bottom teeth. You want to curl your bottom lip so it is firm and press that against the reed while keeping your teeth open slightly. If you can't do this it's because you are using too firm of a reed. Try getting a reed with a lower number, maybe 0.5-1 lower than what you are currently using and see if that helps. Once you build up strength in your lips and can push them against the reed without using your teeth you can move back up to a thicker reed.|`|7UAz8wrsaa	This is completley normal! Saxophone does that to everyone even to me. I am a very experienced, and skilled saxophone player and it happens to me and all of my friends. You should grow out of it in time. Although you cant avoid it when playing for very long amounts of time.|`|i03qjBEfaa	This is normal. If you play for a long period of time this is normal. My band instructor had her dentist make a special mout piece for her that enables her to play for long periods of time without hurting herself.|`|1c9d381b762522a9849b15cca142703eaa	ice|`|Oqy3JFIHaa	Don't worry... I have the same problem at times. Just relax when you play and I make sure to drink water before I play... for some reason that helps. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck!|`|VNoV7tXdaa	i thinks its normal your lip just might be worn out from so much playing<br>  the same thing happens to me with the guitar<br>  when i play my fingers get blisters so it might be similar|`|4BHZxpBUaa	Th3n, don't play the saxophone. Or go 2 the doctor'z or sumn|`|nrnZKaWvaa	Perhaps you might have gotten a pimple or a cold sore on your lip|`|qcgBsAhsaa	do  not press that hard when you play. relax

RXI8ImdIaa	That's really odd. My only idea is that you have tendinitis from the repetitive motion of your arm going back and forth while you run.<br>  <br>  that is really just a guess. You need to show it to a doctor to figure it out.|`|wq7BTHrLaa	If u know anyone that is an EMT or a doctor I suggest u go to them while they aren't at work, so that if it isn't broken you can get it evaluated without having to use any money.
ZuYTZ80Gaa	If you have a family doctor they can do a couple of quick blood tests to confirm the diagosis (a TSH and a free T4/T3).  That will not only help to get treatment quicker but willl help the endocrinologist as well.<br>  <br>  It would be dangerous to start on treatment without the diagnosis confirmed.|`|2ZGEqEJXaa	It sounds more like hyperthyroidism. While you wait for the endocrinologist, you could see an internist. Three months is too long a wait for something like this.
TTI1M4fVaa	Sounds like you have an ear infection. If its a severe one it will burn when you put in the ear drops. Something that I do that works WONDERS is I use peroxide. <br>  I will put that into each ear even if I don't have an infection once a day. Its a home remedy that my family uses. If you put it in and its really bubbly that means there is an infection in your ear (it will also hurt for 2-3 seconds when you put it in but that's okay). You just keep your head tilted to the side (or lay down) until the the bubble sounds minimize. If you have an ear infection and its really bubbly then you need to use this twice a day until the infection is gone. After wards I would recommend doing it once a day. This will help to minimize the chances of you getting another infection in the future.|`|VkYF8VQxaa	First of all, putting liquid in your ear will just make things worse, as you figured out. The reason why you have this problem is that as you go underwater, pressure increases. This pressure increase affects the auditory canal, causing discomfort. Also, you may have ears that are more sensitive than other people. It should go away soon, so do not worry about it. <br>  <br>  Also, have you ever maybe thought that EARPLUGS might be a good idea when you go swimming?|`|Mb7PP53Xaa	i thought maybe a perforated eardrum<br>  i used to have perforated eardrums when i was young<br>  your doctor should be able to tell you|`|7b5d7721387ea9716cf48828f5d4cc1caa	You should go see the doctor or nurse as it could be to do with how much wax you have in your ear (sorry if that's a bit gross!) or your ear canal might be inflamed
2ZGEqEJXaa	It sounds like exercise induced asthma. Your doctor may need to change your treatment to include a different inhaler.|`|CT3t80suaa	Go back to your doctor and say so. It might be that your inhaler isn't strong enough, or something along those lines. The doctors know much more than anyone on here can really help you with, and its what they're there for.|`|AA11780840	Its sounds like asthma but you could also be anemic as well....<br>  Check with your doctor.<br>  I have asthma and I am anemic.<br>  <br>  Good Luck...

(Some girls cannot either).<br>  Life is like a mirror you get back what you give, if she told the guy how she feels about him in a loving way, he would return his feelings.<br>  If ever you demand anything from anyone you never get a sensible answer.<br>  Relax, if he is a bit shy showing his feelings then you show yours, a relationship should be two ways.<br>  Why should he just say the things bf usually say.<br>  You may get problems with all men, real life is not like story books.|`|rIFqv8nvaa	Ok.

Tell her to ask him how he feels every time, and ask him if he loves her every time. After a while this will be engrained in his mind and will open up a bit. If he dosent answer keep asking....just keep asking.|`|Eit68exyaa	I'm a bit that way too.  I'm older now, and figured it out.<br>  I was alone a lot, always thinking interesting things, wishing to say 'you are beautiful' to a girl, but never could. Afraid of rejection or being out-of-line. you know.<br>  When married, I still didn't get used to sharing thoughts.  then when I do, I get shot down for them. Sad no?<br>  Maybe he is a bit sad, lonely and accustomed to not being accepted.<br>  thought : does / did his mom put down his ideas, initiative?  Did he have few friends in school?<br>  It so hard to break out of that habbit and talk when you've not been welcome to in the past.|`|zEy0uuAFaa	He's a normal boy.  Boys don't get a lot of practice sharing their feelings or talking about how they feel when they're growing up, like girls do, because they're put into this expectation that they're supposed to be gruff, stoic and unfeeling.  They're told it's unmanly to express their emotions, so they learn to suppress them as much as possible.  By the time they start to get interested in girls, this habit is ingrained, and you have to teach them to be more open.  Be patient.  It takes a while to overcome all this conditioning, especially if the boy truly believes showing his feelings is childish or girly.  Let him know that him being distant hurts your feelings, and help him learn to express himself.|`|E23s2wSNaa	making love? it sounds like hes using her, or is hiding something, when a guy uses a girl, he has no feelings, and thats what it sounds like<br>  <br>  -----------------------------------<br>  <br>  this question needs to be under singles and dating, u may get more answers there, theres a lot of people on that category all the time including myself, dont delete this <br>  question just ask the same thing under that<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  see i tell my girls things a lot, but everyone is different|`|n13rCdZtaa	Some guys just don't like to talk so much about their feelings. There's no problem with that in my opinion, and if your friend can't really understand it, she should look for someone else who wears their heart on their sleeves. You also say "all the things you would expect your BF to say". I don't really understand that part to be honest. Not all guys tell their girlfriends that they miss them, even if deep inside they do. <br>  <br>  It sounds to me like you and your friend are comparing this guy to maybe other boyfriends that you and your friend have had and therefore are expecting the same sort of thing.|`|AA10350894	Some guys simply have a harder time putting how they feel into words, and although it is important for a girl to hear these words, perhaps she should judge him by his actions until such time as he is comfortable enough to express how he feels verbally.|`|SltEwVX7aa	WHY do we have to say anything?  I still don't get that part.  <br>  <br>  It's the eternal women's complaint about men: that we don't 'talk'.  <br>  <br>  Accept it.  And quit trying to change us.

Also, prolonged diarrhea can have adverse affects on your body so if it is not going away you should call your doctor.<br>  <br>  One thing that is very important when you have diarrhea is getting enough liquid.

gtAb94d2aa	Well, really. It isn't "bad".<br>  <br>  But if you want to get healthy and into shape you want to work on bringing up your cardio workouts to make that heart healthy first. It'll be easier to lose fat. Think of a 5 or 10 minute run, followed by a walk (uphill as you get more comfortable with it), then another sprint. Try to work in more running and constantly push yourself. The more you exercise the more endorphins released - Naturally the happier you'll be.<br>  <br>  Other than running there is tons you can do, yoga classes create a great relaxing environment for weight loss. Another option is Pilates, which is great for muscle building.<br>  <br>  Here are some food intake tips:<br>  <br>  -Drink lots of water<br>  <br>  -Spread your meals out and take in lots of veggies and vitamin boosting foods. This means eating regularly as opposed to the 3-meal/day routine.<br>  <br>  -Protein helps to maintain muscle mass which is important in the fat burning process. Good proteins can come from fish, shrimps, low fat cottage cheese, low fat yogurt, skimmed milk, and egg whites<br>  <br>  -Eat lots of fibre, it keeps that fullness feeling in your stomach to prevent giving into those cravings<br>  <br>  -There are good fats and bad fats. Consume the good ones. Think fish: Salmon, mackerel, herrings and sardines<br>  <br>  -Don't believe what you read about carbohydrates being bad for you, they can actually help you lose weight!<br>  <br>  -Stick to it!|`|3se8BaJLaa	Yes its bad. That is way overweight. Lose weight by dieting well. to lose fat you must burn more calories then you eat.|`|S0ZPErIfaa	you need to lose weight<br>  my advice<br>  is to excersise<br>  dont eat less<br>  but excersise more<br>  what you need to do<br>  to lose weight<br>  is simple<br>  set a timer for 5 mins and do squats nonstop go at a slow pace but consistent one if you cant do 5 off the bat do 3 and get up to 5<br>  do this several times a day 5 mins of squats just do it at a light to moderate but continous pace then when you get better and see yourself losing weight you can lose more weight and now start conditioning yourself by doing as many squats as fast as you possibly can in 5 mins now that is very intense much more so then the simple thing i gave you for slight weight loss if you do that you will ******* drop the pounds theyll fly off and you will get very good conditioning for speed stamina and running at the same time also if you want to do the routine involving conditioning not just weight loss plus then its no longer a routine but a game a challenge try to beat your high score what i say does produce results and if you work for speed conditioning try it out do that for a month i guarantee you you will nhave phenomenal results|`|EONXaXYEaa	You're not FAT.

Eat smaller portions. Honestly, you can eat pretty much whatever you like, just have small amounts of it. Of course, if you're eating vegetables, tofu, non-fat beans, or something healthy, have as much as you want. <br>  <br>  Eat slowly. Put your fork and knife down, chew and swallow your food before taking another bite. Research shows that this helps you eat less and become full faster. Speaking of being full, eat until you're pleasantly full, not uncomfortably stuffed.<br>  <br>  Drink a glass of water before you begin your meal. This is another trick to help you become full faster. <br>  <br>  Avoid "comfort eating" - don't just eat because you feel like it. I have this problem too, I used to eat whenever I was bored or tired or sad. Instead, buy sugar-free gum in your favorite flavor and instead of eating food, grab a piece of gum instead.<br>  <br>  Exercise! Start out slowly, maybe take a short walk around your neighborhood every other day. Gradually increase the duration and speed of your walks – maybe even start jogging, if you’re up to it!<br>  <br>  If this doesn’t appeal to you, try an aerobics, Pilates, or kickboxing class with a friend. They’re fun and you get a workout too! <br>  <br>  Good luck!! :)|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	You are not fat, you are just fluffy|`|K4bJgTF4aa	um are you male or a female? because 5'2 is pretty short (my height yay!) and 175 is not tiny.  if it is muscle...then ok...but if it is all fat...then that is VERY UNHEALTHY.  lose weight by first cutting back on food.  start eating greens, and lean meats (like turkey or chicken) and low calorie foods.  then walk a lot and do some aerobic/cardiac exercises.  it won't all come off in a week.  give it time and best of luck. =)|`|rbVw9Zt8aa	Based on your body mass index (weight/height squared) no you are not. a healthy body comes in all different sizes. it is still important to stay active and maintain a good diet, but in general you are not overweight or obese. make sure you are eating correct proportions, and that you have at least 30-60 minutes of exercise a day or at least try and take a walk or walk around a mall while shopping. i hope i helped! fell good about urself!|`|ee5MawLdaa	Even if you are a guy. . . thats a bit much.

EMbaak9waa	No you can't get a disease from shaving your legs.|`|87pV5lvZaa	Definitely not!  If so, then 90% of the women in America would be diseased!<br>  <br>  As another poster mentioned, use a skin-conditioning shaving cream and a new razor to reduce your risk of razor burn.  However, if you do get small red bumps after shaving, don't stress!  These are simply a rash caused by irritated hair follicles.<br>  <br>  A word of CAUTION: Do not share a razor with anyone else!  Be sure that your razor is your razor alone.  Although you cannot get diseases from shaving in general, you can contract diseases such as hepatitis C from sharing a razor with someone.|`|g19eiYbwaa	nope you can not get a disease from shaving your legs.

V5R1UItlaa	Yes you can definitely get rosacea as a teen. I'm 17 and I've had rosacea since 6th grade. It runs in my family, and I've gone to the dermatologist. They basically told me, that there was nothing they could do and there is no instant cure. The doctor said the best thing is to use moisturizer and wear mineral makeup. I have been using a lotion and face cleaner called Cetaphil and it works good and it has less irritation then other brands.<br>  <br>  I know how you feel, it just seems very embarrassing especially when people always ask why your face is red. It gets annoying. So my advice is to wear mineral makeup. A good mineral makeup brand is bare essentials and no one even knows I wear it!
D4jZM26Paa	I would advise against a "famine" and suggest a fast instead.<br>  <br>  "a severe shortage of food (as through crop failure) resulting in violent hunger and starvation and death"|`|44fe68ac48e4256fe9ab6ffbd1ee8375aa	I just learned about this in biology! :)<br>  Your body uses carbs as its primary source of energy so you eat a meal rich in carbs, your body will burn it off fast. It will give you a short supply of energy and then you'll be hungry and burned out<br>  Protein is used second so it will keep you full for a little bit longer because your body is busy burning off carbs first.<br>  The last nutrient group to be used up is lipids or fats. Fats will fill you up faster and last for a longer time because they are the body's third source of energy. It takes longer to digest them so it's not like it will be running right through you! If I were you I would start eating a fatty meal right now and eat a small portion every two hours until midnight. It's not a good idea to stuff your self with food at like 11:59. If you eat small amounts in intervals you have time to fill yourself up fully and it should keep you going for a lot longer. PLEASE don't listen to the post who said eat a lot of fibre... Your body is not able to digest cellulose (fibre)  which is why you will poo it right back out. That will dehydrate you and leave you starving!  Best of luck! Your strong for doing this!!!|`|E047GSKdaa	You mean your fast?  <br>  Just eat a regular meal.  It is not that hard.|`|Ybkxy4H2aa	Eat red meat, proteins, stuff like that.

bOELcQrpaa	I am 22 and I am Irish, fair skinned w/ freckles.  I used to want to be tan so bad, but a few years ago I spent the day at the beach and got SO sunburned and nauseous.  I ended up throwing up and falling asleep in the car and for the rest of the night.  It's extremely dangerous, and now I put suntan lotion on all the time.  I don't care if I am pale!  If you take care of your skin now and put suntan lotion on, when you are older you will look much younger.  Your skin should NEVER bubble, that is extremely bad for you.  Talk to your doctor about it, as he can direct you to a dermatologist who can take a look at them.  If they are shaped funny then they may be cancerous.|`|VMY7No0eaa	Sounds like sun stoke or sun exhaustion.<br>  This is serious... skin cancer is dangerous (my uncle died because he didn't take care of melanoma) <br>  The worst part of it is you will be WRINKLED BEYOND YOUR YEARS! <br>  <br>  GO to a dermatologist and have the freeze the spot (this way they wont' develop in to sk)<br>  if you have any spots that break and bleed ...

mlaLgoaSaa	Here is what I would suggest:<br>  <br>  1. Change your diet. Try and obtain most of your calories from complex carbohydrates (this will give you energy and keep you feeling full). Remember, you lose fat by burning more calories each day than you consume. Example: If you burn 2000 calories each day just by existing, and burn 300 more through exercise, eat less that 2300 calories. Never skip breakfast. Snacks are fine as long as they are healthy. Examples: fresh fruit and veggies, rice crisps, peanuts, yogurt, etc...) Also, little things will help tons! Like, switch to skim milk, eat low fat yogurt, use cooking spray instead of oils, opt for the low fat foods, eat whole grain bread... All these things will help a lot. <br>  <br>  2. Drink AT LEAST 8 (8oz) glasses of water each day. The more water you drink the better. Especially if you are working out.<br>  <br>  3. Try and do 20-40 minutes of continuous cardio exercise (jogging, speed walking, elliptical, biking) every day, at least 3 times per week (the more days you can do this, the better).<br>  <br>  4. Create a weight training schedule. Try to do some general strength training exercises at least 3 times per week. Remember, muscle burns fat. So, the more lean muscle tissue that is on your body, the faster you will burn fat.<br>  <br>  5. Stretch! This will help to lengthen and tone your muscles. Some studies even show that it can help to prevent injury. It also feels awesome!<br>  <br>  It sometimes takes about 8-12 weeks after starting a weight loss regime to see results (depending on the intensity of your fitness plan). So be patient, and keep with it! It will pay off.<br>  <br>  Do not cut out bread! You NEED carbs. Here is a sample of a low-fat meal plan:<br>  <br>  Breakfast:<br>  1 cup raisin bran w/ skim or soy milk<br>  1 banana<br>  <br>  Snack: <br>  1 handful of nuts<br>  <br>  Lunch:<br>  Turkey on whole wheat w/ lettuce, tomato, and mustard, 1 slice provolone cheese<br>  1 cup broccoli, steamed w/ seasoning<br>  1 orange<br>  <br>  Snack: <br>  1/2 cup low fat cottage cheese or low fat yogurt<br>  <br>  Dinner:<br>  4 oz. lean chicken breast, grilled or baked<br>  3/4 cup brown rice, steamed<br>  1 cup peas or carrots, steamed<br>  <br>  Dessert:<br>  1 serving fat free, sugar free pudding or fat free frozen yogurt|`|hyo4tWv9aa	looks like a good diet, but i would reccomend u take out the walnuts and dates, because they have lots of calories and fats like any dried nuts.  try to add a egg. and remember ur 16 so that means u are high in metabolism.(so dont go hungry) always eat when u will feel hungry and take as much protein as u can because it takes the body lots of work to break it down, so more calorie loss|`|sQxPTjUAaa	i know body building is all about proteins and building muscle, but your not having enough food.<br>  <br>  heres a solid plan that will get you toned in no time!<br>  <br>  breakfast(7:00)-oatmeal or cerial (like cherioos) and a protein shake (dont add the banana and pb)<br>  <br>  snack(9:45)- you need protein at ever meal, and even though walnuts have protein in them, its just not enough for what you want, try having a south beach diet snack bar, or some slices of turkey with a pc of fruit<br>  <br>  lunch(11;30)- you need more for lunch than cottage cheese and berries! try a chicken ceaser salad/or/ chicken or fish with 1 cup of brown rice<br>  <br>  snack(2;00)- power bar(230 calories, 9 grams protein, 3 fat, 56 carbs) the power bar is OK but there isnt enough protein in it and you can choose better things for your muscles (aka protein!) for example 1/2 can of tuna and 1/2 the power bar (for the carbs//or something with carbs in it)<br>  <br>  workouts from 3:00 to 4:30<br>  <br>  snack(5:00)- whey protein shake <br>  <br>  dinner(6:00)- i try to have chicken or salmon or whatever homeade meal my mom makes. i make sure its balanced. make sure your not having too many carbs at dinner, this can ruin your whole diet and make you store fat instead of burn it. load up on the veggies and make sure you have your protein in there!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  SNACK** i would add another protein shake (or maby even half) in right before bed, it wont hurt you at all, if all you make it with is water (or light milk) and powder then youll be fine, and youll see the defenition right away. if you dont feel like having another shake you can always exchange it for 3 pc of turkey and 1 pc of cheese (good proteins/fats)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helped!|`|hXehbPVqaa	you are eating well and exercising great.<br>  exercising is only 30% of weight loss what you eat will help you loss more weight.<br>  don't get as much fruit because it has so much sugar. also have you looked at your shakes? how much added sugar is there?<br>  <br>  cut bread out if you can, if not only have one piece a day for lunch and make sure its not dinner|`|ZZAHlF0naa	It looks good to me but I have always wanted to cut fat and not worry with the other stuff.

But this one guy I was best friends with for 3 yrs he finally asked me out and I thought he was kidding and I was like "Don't you think I'm ugly?" and my friend was there too so she was like "You're not ugly! You're so pretty!" and then the guy was like "She's right, you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen." And like, so the point I'm trying to get to is, you might think they're kidding about you being a ladies man and such because of things you've gone through in the past to destroy your self-esteem but they're actually being truthful.

9EVcTnUWaa	IF you live in assisted living facility there is more than one person to talk to.

IF you're truly having issues with your boyfriend than break up with him so that you don't have that problem it would take away one of your stresses.

Anyways i was sick with the cold/flu virus and my doctor said to drink lots of gatorade and water. Rest for a couple of days then you have to not think you are really sick. you have to get out and do something. So you should start going back to school within the next couple of days. Remember to keep lots of fluids in you. Hope this helped. Also if you can get vitamin C, it tends to help.

Speak to your local doctor or school nurse, ask for them to check your spine for any curvature or deformity. Other reasons for poor posture include, knock knees, improper shoes.<br>  <br>  If you have none of these, then you need to walk and strengthen your abdominal muscles and upper body muscles.

sQxPTjUAaa	theres two ways you can go about doing this:<br>  <br>  -RUNNING- running would burn much more fat than walking, so put it at a speed where you can run or jog easily..not too fast but at a pretty good pace. if you do this 5 times a week for 30 min or more (is better), you will forsure see results within 2-3 weeks.<br>  <br>  INTERVAL TRAINING- (hard! but it works wonders) interval training is known to burn fat quicker than walking or running alone, its kind of a combo between the two, and you can burn 2x more calories in 30 min than running! heres an example:<br>  <br>  Time         Speed                    Incline <br>  5 min.  3.0 mph - warm-up  1% <br>  5 min.  3.5 - 4.5 - walk/slow jog 1% <br>  1 min  5.0 - 5.5 - speed walk/run 2% <br>  2 min  4.0 - 5.0 - walk/slow jog 0%  <br>  1 min 5.0 - 5.5 - speed walk/ run 2% <br>  2 min 4.0 - 5.0 - walk/slow jog  0% <br>  1 min  5.3 - 5.7 - speed walk/run 1-2% <br>  2 min 4.0 - 5.0 - walk/ slow jog  0%  <br>  1 min Walk or run as fast as you can  1-2% <br>  2 min 4.0 - 5.0 - walk/ slow jog  0% <br>  5 min 3.0 - 4.0  0% <br>  <br>  <br>  Also, try to put some weight training in there cause you said you wanted to get rid of your love handels and tone your legs, so running or interval training along with weight training should get you an amazing body in time for binki season =]|`|tPpn8nbKaa	Well when i wanted to lose weight fast i ate about 6 small meals a day to increase my metabolism which burned fat quicker.

gAOAdOHraa	I know I'm in my late 20's now and when I was younger I took every precaution to not get pregnant.  I don't know why people can't be more responsible and if they aren't mature enough to stop an unwanted pregnancy then maybe they should close their legs.|`|vVEnCP0faa	No it doesn't.  I have protected sex (we use condoms and I'm on the pill), I believe I'm at a responsible age (19) and have only had one partner who is my boyfriend of 2 and a half years and even though I believe I am Intelligent about my sex life, I'll admit there have been times that I've been scared that I'm pregnant.  So I guess I'm a little more understanding.<br>  <br>  It does irritate me when these girls are about 14 or 15 and aren't using protection.  That is pretty ignorant, but you can't change the past.<br>  <br>  But over all it doesn't irritate me, and I think the only way it would irritate someone is if you have never had sex, have only had it a few times and are one of those "holier than thou" religious people or are too unattractive inside or out for someone to want to have sex with you.|`|xM4CumQoaa	ya it does, but some people don't no what to do and need help before embarrassing themselves.|`|mvKbfkhGaa	I agree with you 100%!

AA11780840	Anytime you change your diet of course you are going to experience what you are experiencing. It is normal. Ride it out or go back to the same diet as before. It is most likely the food that you are now eating not the increase in water intake.   Your stomach needs to settle down after being shocked by something new. Take some Zantac or some tums if you need to help your stomach a little. It will be a few days before it settles down. But if it doesn't go to your doctor and tell him or her you are on a new diet. Food allergies could be a reason.<br>  <br>  Drink some water and brush your teeth before you nap..<br>  <br>  Give it some time...<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|OZJPrLSwaa	1. I get the same thing. Because you breathe out of your nose most of the time during your nap, the air isn't getting out of your mouth, so it moves around your mouth, therefore creating the taste of your breath. It can also be bacteria bulding up inside your mouth because you are not swallowing and breathing through your mouth as much as you do when you are awake.<br>  <br>  2. Sounds like the pasta is creating gas - try to cut down on that a little. Try using the bathroom twice a day or daily to clean out your system. Keep drinking water to rinse out the extra bacteria. Consult your doctor for further information such as pills, drugs, or other things that may result in stopping gas.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Im 14- and ppl say dont take meds thye have side effects- its perfectly fine. They'll talk to you about it. Dont give up though|`|AA10300538	oh girl, i know how u feel. Hey, i feel like that 99.9% if the time. There are times that i think i am bipolar or something, coz i will be super happy, then after a couple of minutes i feel so sad and burst into tears. That happened a couple of days ago- i was ok, then i took a shower and as i stood there i just started crying. I came out eventually, continued the wailing for a good hour, then i was fine! I even went out to watch a movie! I think im bipolar...idk. But yeah, for me happiness is elusive...it never lasts. My fav quote: hapiness is like a butterfly....ever elusive. It rested on me once, long ago...but now...it wont come near me. Sometimes it flutters for a second on my shoulder, but when i blink its gone...when will i ever be happy?<br>  <br>  I feel that way 100% of the time. I am on antidepressants and am seeing my uni counselor too. I have serious problems...and its easy to give advice (like im doing now)...but yeah, just know u are not alone.<br>  <br>  I wihs u luck in ur pursuit of happiness...and i will see u on the other side (i'll see u when i get there!)|`|Zk4pn8oKaa	I bet i can make u feel better.  Cause a woman as beautiful as u shouldn't be so sad.  Black is beautiful, remember dat.  Don't be so sad. <br>  Let me talk to you.|`|TadINnYoaa	You are already well on the road to recovery.<br>  That is clear by the fact that you are taking up seeing a counsellor which is hard painful but a really good move. It also requires time and building up a relationship with the counsellor.<br>  Plus you have a great insight into your difficulties and are honest and have the courage to write on here about them.<br>  Youve got loads of confidence in there and also appear to have many talents. I recognise this because I have a young niece who has come through very similar hardships.<br>  She was in a real bad way with OCD and anxiety yet with the right support has recovered to being a brilliant outgoing happy young woman.<br>  Most of it is about where you feel safe and familiar and when you are unwell like this those places which are easiest for clinging to are usually somewhere dark lonely and pitiful. But it doesnt have to be that way because you have choices.  Now you have found channels for reaching out to people and sharing where you are at with some who also know what it is like to have anxiety depression etc. You will recover fully I can see it. You have a strong personality.<br>  Take things one day at a time and always try to use music and the personal things that you love in your own unique way. Soon you wont know or want to be that girl who crawls back into the dark space anymore. I used to crawl into bars and alcohol when I was afraid and now I dont go anywhere near either at all. That part of me is dead and gone.<br>  The answer to beating those things starts with telling first yourself then other trusted  people about it. You have done both !<br>  Keep going strong Rhea. You can and will do it !|`|pMmOXlZ6aa	We all have hard times in life. What you need is to identify things that make you happy, and concentrate on those things. Nobody can take that away from you. I wouldn't know how to answer your question, because i don't know you, but i suggest is that you calm your mind. Not everything in this world is fun, and the quicker you accept that, the easier it will be for you to live on.|`|xXhkRq0Caa	I think you are experiencing some type of depression. You are looking for a feeling that is not humanly possible, even if you were to go on medication, no one has the same feeling forever. You will have to learn to accept all types of feelings and not feel paranoid. You have deep rooted issues that you must address with a licensed therapist. Keep your appointment with the therapist so that you can work out your issues. Also, ask for group therapy, this way you will be with others that are experiencing the same things as you. You should also attend yoga classes, these classes help you unwind in a peaceful manner. If you can, try to fore go medication and do things naturally for a while. One more thing, eat healthy meals daily, reduce your sugar intake. Start keeping a journal to record your feelings daily. Just write what you feel, you can even keep inspirational sayings in there. Go now and start taking charge of your life, because you are missing out on some beautiful things. Good luck, I really hope you feel better.|`|hOTrfGHEaa	im in the same boat at the minute broke up with someone last week i feel exactly the same going to docs today but scared of going as don't want anti depressants heard bad things and know someone on them and the trouble they have coming off them|`|GBODLQNcaa	I think you just need do get on your knees and pray and let God see you throug this.|`|8tVV8yqxaa	If your not already seeing a doctor, you really should be...seriously. A therapist cold really help you out.|`|3a1d98e5d06e33a288cfd5d40b0c4470aa	I do not know you well enough as yet to understand why you are so upset, but believe me, no one is happy 24/7. If that were the case, life would be rather boring. The fact is that humans have many different life conditions that vary from moment to moment and depending on how you feel about yourself, the mantra you keep reciting from your lowest consciousness, is what manifests itself when facing obstacles.<br>  <br>  There are many reasons why you may feel the way you are, it could be hormonal, it could be due to grief, it could be because of a realisation, it could be because of a lack of confidence, the only thing I can promise you is that it will pass. I can provide you with all the answers that enable you to grasp your pain in that all suffering is related to our earthbound desires. Each human has a pain body and a level of tolerance. What is easy or fun for one person can be excruciating and even destructive to another. <br>  <br>  In my case, I was fortunate to come across the path of Nam Myoho Renge Kyo which is a full circle doctrine that provides you with all the tools to maintain a certain level of stability. It does not guarantee 100% anything. Nothing does, because our mind perceives life and circumstances in accordance to the journey we travel. A good book to read is 'New Earth' by Eckhard Tolle and does not interfere in whatever religious doctrine or non religious approach you may have. It explains about 'energy'. When you understand that your body is made up of trillions of nucleus atoms and cells, where do the emotions come from and why do other people around you not comprehend your pain? This is merely the springboard to discovering your purpose and your goal in this world. <br>  <br>  If it is grief you need to go through, only time will heal, but even bereavement can allow you to feel a sense of comfort when you understand its complete nature and your connection to the sensation of pain or sadness. One thing, you do not need any chemical substance to feel better. Natural body endorphins and serotonin suffice in that department. It is knowing how to release them.<br>  <br>  Love yourself and understand why you should and give yourself permission to be appreciated by yourself. You need no one but your own approval. This sets you free and allows you to forgive yourself also. To receive love, you must be able to give love. To give love, you need to know how and this comes from loving yourself. Be kind and gentle with your own sensitivity and trust in your own abilities. Start your own healing process right now. This is a new moment and from here on end, you live in this moment. In each and every moment 100%. Giving it your best. Whatever that is at that time. No one is perfect!
8rI3Efykaa	It is definitely an STD because it's transmitted through un protected sexual contact. Just rubbing is enough. And yes, often men don't see the microscopic wart (the symptom of HPV) which can be only be discovered, when that small, with the use of a  special light in a specialized clinic. Often, ignorant general practitioners give men a clean bill of health when they can't even see the microscopic warts! As for women, it's much easier to know if they have the microscopic warts inside (which the men can't see) because of their yearly PAP smears. Sometimes you can clearly see them.

Hey, and if you don't you will be much healthier.  In fact you might put on muscle - increase your weight - and be much slimmer.  It's not how much you weigh so much as your health overall that really matters.  I've always been quite slim but weighed more than people would expect for most of my life because I have a high proportion of muscle.

VQID67Blaa	Because if you are really cutting yourself they look and feel like paper cuts, but they aren't. Its hard to judge how deep the cut is that you have made. After you cut your self so many times you cut deeper and deeper. Eventually they are no longer like "paper cuts" and you can easily bleed out from them. It is especially easy to bleed out if you hit a vein. Its also unhealthy because it increases your risk of getting infection in one of the cuts.|`|9SX6673eaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  First of all any cut can become infected because of the bacteria that is on the implement that cut you, or any bacteria that is in the area where you were cut.<br>  <br>  If you are deliberately cutting yourself, people may be referring that it's unhealthy behavior to want to cut yourself, or to hurt yourself. If that is what you are doing, please, seek some professional help. What you are doing is called self-mutilation and I don't think you would even like the sound of that.<br>  <br>  The people that care for you are only trying to help you by saying it's unhealthy, and it is.|`|Njx3roeDaa	Unless you feel cutting yourself is the right thing, it's best that you don't. <br>  Cutting yourself over time with a bunch of cuts will make people think your odd. Having a 'gazillion' cuts over you isn't the most appealing look.<br>  <br>  But its not just about the looks that this can hurt you. If your cuts were to get bigger and bigger, it could lead to an infection. Infections can get really bad if you do not treat them properly. If someone were to continue with the paper cuts, but if they were to enlarge over time, with your big gash of a cut + an infection could possibly cause death. Only if your cut were to become as big as your kneecap, a chance of serious condition or death MAY occur.<br>  <br>   Do not worry about your small paper cuts. If you were purposely continuing this habit, it would hurt quite a bit. Just make sure not to cut yourself on purpose because it's just unhealthy like that.

You do it to self medicate or make you feel better. Eventually, a paper cut isn't going to make you feel any better. You'll likely eventually go for something more serious.<br>  <br>  That isn't healthy. The fact that you're in a state of mind as it is to cut yourself isn't healthy, either.<br>  <br>  Coming from someone bipolar, I'd suggest you find someone to talk to.

I'm not going to BS you and say join a club to get new friends-most likely your in a tough place right now and reaching out to new people is just going to make things more difficult. <br>  <br>  If you get those good grades, you can lift yourself out of everything you dislike so much and go to a good college. And trust me...almost everyone loves college.<br>  <br>  If you feel like you can't stand it anymore, there are two things you can do. 1-Reach out to a semi-close friend and create a bond. Having someone is important.  2-buy a journal and write everything you hate in it. Keeping feelings bottled up is going to make things worse. A journal may actually help keep you stable.|`|AA11702728	Hi!<br>  I felt it was really important to answer your question as it's not nice to see someone so unhappy. I am no expert but i'm going to attempt to answer your question.<br>  Ok with parents, I don't know how old you are but if you're a teen then it's really normal for you to argue with your parents, I know I did and now (In my early 20's) I get on really well with them. Maybe you could try talking to them about how you feel, addressing some of the problems about why you don't get on. It's usually all about compromise. I know everyone might suggest this, but if you don't talk to them how do you expect to have a good relationship? or how can they understand you're point of view if you never express that to them. If you really don't feel comfortable talking to them maybe just aim to do something with them, i.e. sit down together for dinner and enjoy random conversation, or watch a movie if you all want to have a laugh I would suggest a comedy! Doing activities together might bring you all together. If you start getting on with your parents you will benefit from a happier home life and you might actually enjoy living at home with them?!<br>  If you are in your 20's or not a teenager you could always look into getting your own place where you're not restricted by your parents, and you don't have to conform to their rules. Also decorating a new home will give you a project to take your mind off things. I know it's expensive but you could always look into renting or house sharing so it works out cheaper. Alternatively you could always look into going to college/uni - it gives you an oppertunity to move away from home and be more independent at the same time you can study a subject you love if you pick the right course for you.<br>  At home is there a brother, sister, auntie, uncle, grandparents you could talk to. From you're question you seem quite lonely, you could maybe talk to someone you know about how you feel, i know when i share problems with people I feel a lot better afterwards, like a weight has been lifted. If you want to meet or make close friends then get yourself out there, join a club (there are so many out for all sorts of interests so you're bound to find one you like!), excercise class, start a hobby - not only will you meet people but it will take your mind off how you feel. If your friends invite you out always say yes and go....it's much better to be out having a good time than sat inside alone feeling miserable.<br>  You need to get help with your self harming and suicidal feelings, I would suggest calling the samaritans <br>  <a href="http://www.samaritans.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.samaritans.org/</a> <br>  they are trained to deal with these situations and will be able to help you!!! If you don't want to ring them maybe try speaking to your doctor?<br>  You don't need to pretend you're happy all the time, botteling up your feelings is not good for anyone, I feel it's important for you to sit down and let it all out whether that's with your parents, a member of your family, friend, helpline or counsellor.<br>  You need to adapt a more positive attitude, only you can change the way you feel about life, but people WILL want to help you as much as possible, instead of concentrating on how everything goes wrong, you should focus on the positive, the good things in your life and the things you are grateful for. <br>  Changes can't happen overnight, you need to work on it. I wish you all the best and I hope life starts to get better for you asap!! Please don't suffer in silence, speak to someone and be proactive in changing your life and way of thinking for the better.<br>  Good luck and I hope this helped!|`|fc1558ce0e3b1ca7711c74b1a6c9f385aa	Do you have anyone that you can speak with regarding your situation? What about a Minister or Pastor, or a counselor in school? You really need to speak with someone about what you are going through and how you're feeling. What is causing you to feel like this? Why do you want to harm yourself? It sounds as if you are young, so please believe me when I say this, things will get better, but it will take time. Everyone goes through periods in their life when things don't go right, and they feel hopeless and they feel there are no options. Your life will get better. Find things that make you happy, meet people who you have things in common with. Hurting yourself or killing yourself are never solutions. You are in pain. You can't avoid the pain by causing more pain, or ending your life. Find ways to deal with that pain. What is causing your unhappiness? Figure that out and find ways to be happy. Maybe it is talking with someone, maybe it is taking meds., whatever. There are ways to get through this. I have felt the same pain you have so please, get help.

Zt6eh6VRaa	Well, I didn't grow out of my acne until my forties!! And I have a client in her 70's who breaks out if she doesn't use products. This is why I became an acne expert, so I could help those people who "don't grow out of it" in their early 20s. <br>  <br>  I know that skin problems can be extremely frustrating, especially when you feel like you've tried everything and nothing works!<br>  <br>  I own an acne clinic and have helped hundreds of people to get clear skin (all around the world!). In order to help you I need to know a few things:<br>  <br>  First of all, I need to know what kind of acne you have. Then I need to know how sensitive your skin is. We have a long-distance program that determines both of those so we can help you in the best way.<br>  <br>  For a start, you can get some Neutrogena On the Spot benzoyl peroxide and start of veeery slowly with it. Just wear it for 15 minutes a day. Then double the wearing time every three days. Then, when you are up to wearing it for 3 hours for 3 days in a row, then start wearing it overnight. You need to wear benzoyl everyday in order for it to work and not just "on the spot" but all over. It prevents the acne from forming in the first place.<br>  <br>  That will help your acne alot, but it usually takes more than that to get clear. <br>  <br>  For free information about:<br>  <br>  1. Acne<br>  2. Foods that make it worse<br>  3. Ingredients in makeup that can make it worse<br>  4. Things you can do today to make your skin better.<br>  5.

Now!!!!|`|W0hNoMSsaa	I am sorry about your acne. May I suggest a few things?<br>  <br>  1. Be careful not to touch your face. Most people do this a lot without even realizing it. Your hands carry a lot of germs that can aggravate acne.<br>  <br>  2. Try using an acne-clearing facial cleanser such as Biore that contains salicylic acid.<br>  <br>  3. Dab a little tea tree oil on breakouts to help them heal faster.<br>  <br>  4. Drink lots of water.<br>  <br>  5. If you wear makeup, use an oil-free foundation that is labeled "non-comedogenic."

Try not to let them get you down and just enjoy life. :-}|`|q1R8BDrnaa	I had them as a teen too, as an adult I have them occassionally. <br>  <br>  The best thing to do it moisturise everyday, it helps to keep the elasticity in the skin and therefore reduces the stretch marks as your skin becomes more flexible. :)<br>  <br>  Try finding a moisturiser with Neroli Oil in it as this also helps reduce the appearance of the ones you have, possibly something withRose or Lavender too as this reduces any redness in the skin.|`|XadcGNGnaa	You're growing a lot as a teenager.

ItJzrvQ4aa	Those who are extremely lean tend to have weaker immune systems,<br>  making them prone to infections, surgical complications, and slower<br>  recovery times for illness. They tend to have low muscle mass, and<br>  less than ideal hair, teeth, and skin composition. They may have<br>  disruptions in the ability to regulate hormones and protect bone<br>  health, and women could become unable to menstruate.<br>  There are many reasons why people may find it hard to gain weight.<br>  Genetics can obviously play a role, but individual personalities and<br>  the environment can be strong factors.<br>  Some people are just more physically active, they tend to move around<br>  more,<br>  burning more calories than they take in. In children, the inability<br>  to gain weight may signal a condition<br>  known as "failure to thrive," which means a kid is not growing<br>  appropriately for his/her age. This may be caused by an illness, or<br>  eating patterns dictated by a parental idiosyncrasy. <br>  Being able to eat anything with abandon is also deceiving -- even the<br>  skinny need to worry about having too much sugar and fat for good<br>  health. Poor diets can lead to ailments such as heart disease,<br>  stroke, and<br>  cancer. <br>  If you want to put on weight, you should work out, to insure that you<br>  put on muscle and not fat. Healthy weight gain, just like healthy<br>  weight loss, takes time and<br>  requires a conscious effort to apply good habits.<br>  Recommended Ways to Gain Weight<br>  Have meals with the right balance of proteins, carbohydrates, and the<br>  right kinds of fat (such as unsaturated and monounsaturated fats,<br>  olive oil, canola oil, pistachios, almonds and walnuts). Heinemann<br>  suggests the following ratio: 60%-70% carbohydrates, 10%-15% protein,<br>  and a small amount of fat. <br>  Eat foods higher in calories, vitamins, and minerals, as opposed to<br>  higher in fat or sugar. <br>  Pack more nutritious calories in each serving. For example, you may<br>  add grated cooked eggs to mashed potatoes, ground chicken to soups and<br>  gravies, cheese in casseroles, eggs, and soups, and nonfat dried milk<br>  in soups, shakes, milk, and mashed potatoes. <br>  If you get too full too fast, try having more high-calorie foods or<br>  slices of foods as opposed to consuming the whole thing (raisins<br>  versus grapes, granola and Grape Nuts versus corn flakes, mango slices<br>  versus the whole mango). <br>  Limit drinking beverages to a half-hour before and after a meal. <br>  Drink mixed juices (apple/berry, peach/orange/banana as opposed to<br>  one juice beverages) for a higher calorie intake. <br>  With moderation, you may add in good fat sources to meals such as<br>  nuts, avocado, olives, and fatty fish (salmon and mackerel). <br>  Snack in between meals. Nuts, dried fruits, and yogurt are good<br>  options, but it's also important to find nutritious foods that you<br>  will enjoy. <br>  Have a nutritious snack before bedtime, such as a peanut butter<br>  sandwich.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Eat lots of nuts. They're full of healthy fats. What is your calorie intake? The guidelines for females is 2000, so try and increase that to maybe 2300?|`|7b5d7721387ea9716cf48828f5d4cc1caa	Don't start eating really fatty foods or eating more than you should as you'll just become unhealthy. You could eat more carbs, fruit (which is high in sugar and unless you go for a run straight away, will help you put on weight) and also look at the website below. Hope this helps!|`|STQuFtaYaa	why would you wanna gain weight|`|v4DfbDEQaa	eat more then ur friends, have extras and if ur always moving around calm down
K2QwEM4raa	I know all about xanax and stress and even if you are having a panic attack I think you need to go back to the Dr. because of the physical pain. I also think you will really mess up your sinus's if you keep using that inhaler. Something is definitely not right. Usually people that forget to breathe are on meds and in to much of a deep sleep or have a sleep disorder.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Go back on the xanax. Or get your doctor to write you for another antianxiety pill. You really need it dude.|`|PCsW0gbPaa	No.  You are having a panic attack. <br>  This is a purely psychological/stress reaction.  You are in no real danger.<br>  But it sounds very unpleasant.  You should probably talk to your doctor again and try to get a medication that works for you.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  One of the symptoms of panic attacks is that the person suffering is always convinced that it is not a panic attack but a physical problem (and sometimes that they are dying).  It can be very exasperating for others because it's always the same.  But you are describing a panic attack.  There is no other medical issue that causes what you describe.  Go to the doctor, get medication, and stay on it.

You are not married so at this point, you should really start thinking about yourself before your stress can negatively affect your own health.

i03qjBEfaa	No that is untrue, and a common misconception. If you lift too much you will, WILL hurt yourself. The best way to get bigger is to start off with a very small amount of weight but lift that about 20 times (you'll know the right weight when you find one that you can barely notice but gives a very little burn towards the end of the 20).  Take a small break between sets (you'll tire yourself out and/or hurt yourself if you don't). For the next set you're going to take the weight up a notch, to whatever weight gives you medium resistance (its not hard to lift but its not easy either, sorry, there are no exact terms here so it may seem a little vague). About 15 reps should do it here. Rest, and the take the weight up again. Make it heavy enough to where your arms/legs/whatever are on fire. In all you'll be doing 45 reps. Now don't do this every day. Do this every other day. If you are extremely sore do not attempt to work out that muscle. If you injure yourself you will actually be reversing the progress you have made.|`|3SNhXpf0aa	You should be doing 5x5, or 5 sets of five reps.<br>  <br>  Find a weight where you can only do 5 reps, don't use a small amount and only do 5 reps, you must find a weight where you are only able to complete 5 reps. Don't do more than 5 sets because anymore then that and you will be over training.<br>  <br>  This will promote strength, and if you are eating enough, muscle mass.|`|qfvuwWMJaa	it is true, and to get bigger you need to do 5-7 reps and arounds 6-8 sets|`|xreWOKBYaa	I would recommend setting up an appointment with a trainer (aprox $50 an hour) for one session.

Those symptoms often force you to seriously limit your physical activity. It's also common to have problems concentrating and remembering things.

A proper diagnosis often takes months.<br>  <br>  Adding to these considerable frustrations, it can be difficult or impossible to qualify for Social Security Disability benefits.

It will slow down over time if you are concerned about it.<br>  <br>  By the way, it doesn't have anything to do with masturbation or touching yourself.  I didn't masterbate untill I was about 17 or 18 and my boyfriend did it to me, and I still had those thoughts and feelings when I was your age.  Totaly normal.
n7OYTY0aaa	Have a couple of pads with you at all times or you could start wearing pantiliners!|`|1BbnyTfBaa	Coalition for Positive Sexuality<br>  <a href="http://www.positive.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.positive.org/</a>|`|u1t12bsAaa	You are not a loser. This a scary, exciting time in your life. Invest in some very thin panty liners and wear them daily. Most periods start slowly and this will absorb the first spotting. You can then go to the bathroom at your earliest convenience and change to a thicker pad or tampon. Tampons do not hurt if you put them in properly. Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell when your period will start or how heavy it will be. You are smart to be prepared. Good luck!|`|ORUAtr0kaa	Starting later doesn't determine how heavy it will be. I generally first time, just got a stain, so it wasn't that bad. Most people start with a very small amount, like a half-period or something.  Try carrying a pad/tampon around with you, at all times . Also just to avoid bad luck: don't wear white pants :)|`|MHQkgpdqaa	just keep pads or tampons in your purse ! relax ! dont stress it will make it worse.|`|AA11902084	hey there...it will be ok lol i was just as scared as you were at first but luckily i got mine in the summer.<br>  but when you first get it you probally wont "feel" it and mine wasnt very heavy at first but people differ also the same with cramps and or symptoms at first i had NO symptoms at all but the longer i have had my period ive been getting more symptoms such as cramps and my breasts just started getting tender before i start which i was freaking out but then talked to my mom. <br>  and the pad thing....it rele doesnt matter what kind you get but using a pad is very uncomfortable and strongly recomend using tampons which i just started using and i wish i would have a long long time ago of course there gunna hurt the first time but after that its fine and you can go swimming!!! lol and i also recomend plastic its a lot easier to use.<br>  hope i helped!!|`|pBxLZFGzaa	Wow... That's a LOT of questions... Ok:<br>  <br>  1)When you first get it, no it's not heavy AT ALL. The first day is fine. The second, is a little heavier and then it starts to become less, and less, and less.<br>  <br>  2)From what I've heard all over the place, "Always" pads are the best. And also Kotax. They take up the least amount of space, and have the highest absorbency rate. Stayfree SUCKS. They only absorb the thickest of liquids, (blood) but never the runniest, or the thickest. You can try them, to see if they work for you, but I would advise the latter.<br>  <br>  3)The first time you get it, it almost never gives any pain to you. It's only after the first few months that you feel any cramps or tension.<br>  <br>  4)After you've had it for a while, you feel it a lot, and yes... I've known it to be quite miserable... Some of my friends go home with soreness in their uterus...<br>  <br>  5)Tampons are quite difficult, but any kind will do once you actually can figure them out.<br>  <br>  6)You can feel it, but when you feel... the blood... slip out... it's not exactly uncomfortable... itsnice<br>  <br>  7)Instructions for when it happens:<br>  -Always keep a rolled up ordinary jacket in your locker<br>  -Place a pad inside of it<br>  -Tell the teacher that you feel terrible (Mention diarrhea if necessary)<br>  -On your way over there go to your locker, pull out the rolled up jacket<br>  -Go to the bathroom...etc... Place the jacket on the stall's coathook<br>  -And wear the jacket on your way back to the class<br>  -If they ask why you have it, say: "I felt ill, and rather cold."<br>  -This way, if you make them think you're ill, you may get an opportunity to go home, and spend your first day in the safety of your house: a supplied, secretive area. :D|`|K8Lm8JsDaa	It's like you read my mind.. I'm 15, I haven't started and I'm asking alot of the same questions.. So don't be scared, you're not alone. <br>  If your teacher won't let you leave, just tell them you're having "lady problems" and they'll understand and let you go.. If the don't, screw them! Leave the class anyways. :) <br>  And if you''re scared and embarrassed to walk out with a tampon, just wear a long sleeve and slide it up your sleeve on your way to the bathroom. <br>  That's all I can answer.. Sorry.<br>  Like I said, I have started either.. So I could use some help too. <br>  Good luck. :)|`|TTvvVRcBaa	I cant answer all because im a guy, But im training to be a GP so some answers i know....<br>  <br>  When your period starts, its not heavy, It wont be a great gush of blood. Normally you will know when your soon to be on by soreness of breasts also bloating in the stomach.<br>  <br>  The pad with the water, It didnt work because your period isnt that heavy, Its not like a tap coming out of you. If you change you pad every couple of hours your good to go.<br>  <br>  I would say stick with pads first, Some people are different. Just because its your first time im sure they are easier to use.
ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|3SNhXpf0aa	By decreasing your body fat percentage. Actually it's not only the best way, it's the only way. You must have ~10% body fat to have nice abs. Visible abs are about 12-14%<br>  <br>  In order to do this, you must lose fat. To lose fat, you must eat 1800-2000 calories a day, and burn around 300+ a day. Walk/jog/run for 45 min a day 5-7 times a week. Getting abs takes work, you must be dedicated.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	We all have abs--I take it you mean toned abs.  All sorts of activities build abs.  Pilates exercises are popular because they work all the different layers of ab muscles, in different planes of motion.  The classes are a bit expensive but a good place to start.  Afterwards you can practice the exercises at home while pursuing other fitness activities.|`|OtDms9wEaa	Crunches, crunches and more crunches. Sit ups are good but not great for your neck. Sex helps build those muscles too. Don't eat fatty, high cholesterol foods|`|F1oGer5Haa	If you were born a normal human being, like us, you were probably born with them.|`|cWnEia5haa	lose weight and crunches.|`|p8J9JBxZaa	The best way to get abs is to...<br>  <br>  + Stop eating fake health foods. Eat natural unprocessed foods.<br>  <br>  + Dont waste your time with hundres of crunches!<br>  <br>  + Do the proper exercises such as deadman rolls, mountain climbers, and lunges.<br>  <br>  + No long drawn out cardio. Short extreme bursts of cardio routines.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps

MeeJWmGtaa	So what is it? "after sex" or "not doing anything sexual"?<br>  <br>  Because if milky white stuff is "discharging" right after sex, that would be your partners cumm dribbling back out again.|`|9pLdhuBnaa	This white stuff that you noticed is most likely discharge that comes from the vagina which is normal to have.  The color of it can be an indication that you might be ovulating (an example only) depending on where you are in your cycle.<br>  <br>  However, I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.|`|EXPdJVLaaa	Discharge was 1 option.<br>  2nd means you could possibly be pregnant!|`|epsUr7d4aa	sounds like *** or idk
c3MFIbeUaa	Interesting read and yes, you have a valid point there.<br>   I believe when manufactures add or take products out to produce a longer shelf life, we become unwittingly victims.<br>   I also will state that man's desire to consume these products in  large quantities also makes a statement to how well they care about their own bodies and therefore allowing them to become the blimps, encourage laziness and less outgoing as a person.<br>   I find these chemicals are foreign to the human body and instead of helping ones digestion, actually does the opposite. It promotes build up and therefore a blockage to the body operating normally.<br>   There is where the many problems of the body lies in wait for us. Some times quicker then we ever could realize.<br>   It is sad that many of these traits are passed on during breast feeding and actual Development inside a mother's womb. However i wonder if this wasn't all a design by human engineering to cause a decrease in the human population or is it just a consequence of a "on Demand" society.<br>   I learned a lot about nutritional values when i searched out about diets for myself. There are some products now that i will never eat again<br>  Great question and deserving my further attention as well as others.
K2QwEM4raa	I think asthma too, tell your parents that you need to see a Doc.|`|qLvhoRpsaa	You are 13 years old. You have the right and ability to go to a Doctor's Office or Walk-In Clinic. You need to be checked out by a doctor. I am sorry that is seems your parents do not see fit to do this with you. There are several reasons that you have been feeling this way. Many of them are manageable and nothing to worry about AFTER you get them checked out. <br>  You can also go and speak with your high school counselor or nurse and they may assist you in finding a doctor or clinic. <br>  Good Luck. Peace:)|`|sw2R5A9iaa	yes -but we all die sometime.  have your parents take you to a pulmonologist.|`|1h5RpINNaa	When you cough you are still taking in air and you would pass out if you were not taking in enough.  When you pass out your breathing pattern will even out again.  Tell your parents to take you to the dr if it is that big of a concern.|`|MoUtk7cUaa	if you're coughing, you're breathing.  but you still have an issue that needs to be addressed.|`|5rn8OzwAaa	its probably asthma, u should get that treated|`|4rxAeyybaa	One other (very likely) possibility is that you 'just' suffer from hyperventilation. Even though the word 'hyperventilation' sounds harmless, it can feel like you're going to die. The worst thing however that can happen is that you faint, after which your breathing normalizes. You won't die from it (unless of course you had something in your mouth like candy; you can choke on that).<br>  <br>  Like the answers above: go to your doctor.|`|f7GPOxooaa	consult a doctor if your that concerned<br>  also tell your friend to shut up when i was your age whenever anything hurt my friend told me it was cancer and i was going to die...it wasn't cancer it was pain(obviously)... friends say stupid things.<br>  <br>  maybe its asthma|`|kRHXcsX7aa	if u caant breath u will die....ur parents should listen to u....u need to make them understand this situation .....to me it sounds very serious....book a docters appointment asap....u need to get to the bottem of this problem and treat it before its to late|`|gGJn9G5Zaa	see a doctor. you might have some really bad disease.

Since it has been going on for so long yes you should see a doctor right away. Probably before now. <br>  <br>    I have Asthma, allergies and asthma can both give about the same kind of problems you mentioned. People live with allergies all of the time but your would feel more comfortable if you took something for it. The asthma can be more serious. <br>  <br>    If your parents aren't listening to you and since your a minor, there are 2 things you can do. I am not sure if you can get into a doctor without their permission and they should be aware of what you do anyway. But go to the school nurse, tell them what is going on and ask what she or he recommend. See if there is anyone you can get into to see. Tell her everything it is their job to make sure you kids are safe. <br>  The other thing is to go to your local pharmacist, drug store. Tell him what is going on and how long etc. Ask what he recommends. And ask him if he could explain about asthma to your parents for you.<br>  <br>  There are times that I get really choked up and say " I can't breathe, the doctor tells me if I can cough and talk I am getting air, even though it is restricted and hard to get a full breathe, but it can be serious so please do some checking. <br>  <br>    If I knew who you were and could talk with your parents I would tell them what I know about asthma and let them know that you should be seen. They might listen to someone older. They might listen to the school nurse or Pharmacists too. <br>  <br>    If you have a computer at home look up webmd and look up Asthma and show your parents what it says. That could help too. I am sure they have probably heard you coughing. Do you cough anything up when you cough or is it just a dry cough?<br>  You can contact me at peaceinhim33@yahoo.com<br>  Bridget|`|oSAnBPPDaa	I'm pretty sure you can't be coughing and not breathing at the same time. If you can cough, that means something is restricting your airway but not completely blocking it. I'd say to get it check out by your family doctor. Hope you feel better!|`|Cfja6h4Kaa	Don't you ever go to the doctor? Next time you are there, describe the problem to him. It could be asthma, maybe?<br>  <br>  You've had this problem for 7 years, and you haven't died yet, so try not to worry so much.|`|a1EYZNQNaa	go to an asthma and allergy specialist. tell ur parents u dont wanna die for god sakes!!!! its most likely asthma or some respiratory disease. get help fast. u may need an inhaler or some other medication.|`|0ySakvLcaa	if your coughing your breathing and you wont die but do ask your doc the next time you see him/her let them tell you whats wrong not your friends      do your parents smoke?|`|ROtxg1kSaa	beckie listen to MOST of these people most of them have good ideas like hmm idk GOING TO THE THE DOCTOR!!! gesh your so stuborn.|`|xye2XCdeaa	Go to the doctor!

ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	There's no way to know for certain when a bone is fractured without getting an x-ray, but there's a few things you can do to make an educated guess.  With a bruise, you should have no trouble moving your arm, wrist, and fingers normally, and the pain shouldn't be too much worse when you move things.  With a fracture, you are likely to have difficulty moving your arm, wrist, or fingers, and there is usually a position where the pain prevents you from moving the limb any further.|`|Ybu2E2OWaa	it sound like you only bruised yourself pretty badly but get an x-ray just in case.

VFhE8nBxaa	Crush: 5 carrots, spinach, 2 leaves of dandelion, 2 broccoli flowers and one beet. Eat sleep similar to a baby. <br>  A few hours earlier than bedtime get Kava kava. Decrease stress, tension, anxiety and relaxes muscles. It aid to fall asleep deeper and to rest more. It can be used the same as a sedative when taking a large dose, as efficiently as, benzodiazepines but without the side effects. <br>  Combine 2 tsp of honey to 1 glass of warm water. Drink just prior to sleeping. Provide half the amount to babies it will aid put them to sleep. <br>  The most admired herb for insomnia is Valerian, It loosen up nerves and muscles, improves sleep quality and makes falling asleep easier. <br>  2 tsp of fenugreek leaves juice among 1 tsp of honey at bed times every day. <br>  Tuck a lavender sachet beneath your pillow prior to leaving for the day. As you come home you will sleep better. <br>  <br>  <br>  First of all getting prepared to sleep is very important in Insomnia cases. Hot baths to relax, Reading books is a great way to slowly fall into sleep. Don't eat anything past 6-7 or drink any caffeine past 6-7 because doing either increases your metabolism. Complete silence no computer or TV two hours before you try to sleep because this adds to your stress level your thinking and anxiety.|`|aDBQncYuaa	Wear yourself out physically. I've had problems sleeping since i was a kid (like 5 years old), and I've found the only way I can sleep at all is by doing extremely physical work. I've spent the last 12 years working in warehouses, factories, furniture stores, and the like just to be able to sleep. I spent 12 months behind a desk and nearly went insane from sleep deprivation. <br>  <br>  Another thing to try is masturbating. May sound odd, but it works for a lot of people.
F4DhYjlnaa	Plucking your armpit hairs is fine, there should be no adverse health effects. When you sweat, there are naturally bacteria present on your skin that break down your sweat - that is what causes the B.O. - their waste products. <br>  <br>  To make your life easier, you might consider getting an epilator, since you can already stand the pain of plucking - it will make it go much faster! <br>  <br>  I rarely use deoderant either, as little as possible, like every few days if I am able. I don't think plucking has any effect on this, because my smell stays the same whether I wax my pits, epilate them, shave them or let them grow out European style:) lol|`|OZKwc1pHaa	Don't pluck - this is a waste of time and will cause ingrown hairs and irritable skin. Shaving is quick and convenient and contrary to popular belief does not make hair grow back quicker. If you are UK based hair removal creams like Veet also do a good job. Waxing is painful but you will have up to two weeks hair free.|`|NHoG9OBjaa	That can also happen from shaving your arm pits as well, as a precaution whenever you shower make sure to exfoliate your arm pits with a shower puff or something of that nature and you should avoid anything like that.<br>  <br>  As for body odor, you are still quite young and you are going to notice that your body odour gets more noticeable as you proceed into adolescence regardless of your hygiene regiment.|`|0ZQrxZuAaa	ew|`|sfuOL8V7aa	ewwwwww!

zEy0uuAFaa	No - your balls and the other glands that contribute to semen keep functioning all your life.  There is no lifetime limit that you need to worry about depleting - it's a completely renewable resource.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, if a man ejaculates repeatedly over a short period of time, the volume may reduce or he may climax without ejaculating.  But "once a day" is far away from that.  And if this does happen, all the fluids become available again after a few hours' rest.<br>  <br>  Most young boys masturbate about once a day, some more, some less.  Your masturbation is not excessive.  Don't worry about it.  It's normal and it's good to keep your sex parts exercised.|`|AA11785060	The average guy can easily ejaculate 4-5 times a day with no ill effects. So you aren't even close to having any issue.  No different than if you were lucky enough to have sexual intercourse every day-- bet you wouldn't be asking if that was bad.|`|IM3QwSS2aa	yes, when the well runs dry that's that guys limit.  sperm production will replace it.<br>  <br>  /jerome|`|MeeJWmGtaa	Hmmm, at least once a day in the last 5 months, call it about 200 times in total...<br>  OMG you've only got about 300 shots left for the rest of your life!<br>  <br>  <br>  No, but seriously, nothing wrong with masturbating, but keep it to a sane level, man. You won't go blind, and your "balls" won't stop working (that's not where sperm is made anyway), but obsession with any one thing is not healthy.|`|SltEwVX7aa	you can jerk it as often as you like/need to.  the more times a day you do it, the less ejaculate you may get each time, but that's pretty normal.

0nc4OHs3aa	It doesn't hurt.<br>  Wel i guess it depends on the person, but mine didn't hurt as i got it done. When i left the place the pain began but i took a pain reliever and it helped, i also couldn't bend down or sleep on my stomach because it got sore, but the bending down was only 1 week and sleeping on it lasted about 2-3 weeks.

tGEMwgyBaa	Usually the sensitivity goes away after a few weeks but this has lasted to long, you may just need to go back to the dentist and have them take an x-ray of the tooth. It could be that the filling has a leak or a crack in it or the filling was big to begin with and does need to have a root canal now. Root canals should not hurt, if it does you should let the dentist know and they will numb the area more so that you don't feel it. The tooth would then require a crown after the root canal to protect the tooth from further damage.That would worst case scenario. It would be great if it just needed to be refilled with a protective liner at the base of the tooth prior to the filling being put in. This will take the sensitivity away. Hope this was helpful, good luck
VFhE8nBxaa	Currently, there is still no known cure for genital herpes. There is no reason to lose hope though if you were recently diagnosed with the disease because herpes can be easily managed through medication and implementing healthy and positive changes in your lifestyle. To manage the disease properly, one must be able to control its symptoms and outbreaks.<br>  <br>  <br>  Your boyfriend needs to be tested and more than likely will have this as well and he needs to be treated for it as well other wise you taking the meds won't help unless you stop sleeping with him. From here on out if you and your boyfriend don't last you need to be honest with guys you might be with later and tell them that you have this because even though you take a med for it that's still not 100% and you'll always have this so please be responsible with it.|`|yo65rDLDaa	toothpaste|`|uYzjMAI8aa	Never nice, they come and go but seem to flair up when your batteries are low and your system is a little more vulnerable than usual.

B2cvkTp7aa	All I can tell you is when something is a "supplement" that means there has been NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE of the accuracy of the claims. The FDA has not approved it for the use they are saying you can get from it. Meaning, the HGH injections are real, as you need a prescription. The oral and pill form is not b/c it is a "supplement". May have some HGH in it, but could be .00005%. They never say how much is in there.<br>  <br>  However, I have used Melatonin to help me go to sleep at the same time in the past, and it is also a supplement, but did work for me.<br>  <br>  However, if something sounds too good to be true, that is a big red flag. It's like those diet ads that say you can eat everything in site and not work out and lose 50 lbs in 2 months. If it were true, no one would be fat.|`|D8SpQAgLaa	Read the wording carefully. It's not actually HGH that they're selling. It's "HGH enhancers". Meaning, herbs that "might" have a small effect on the HGH your body has naturally. No guarantee you're even getting anything for your money. Whatever your goals are, you can probably get better results with vitamins, herbs, and supplements that you actually know and understand what you're getting.|`|x2mgUMb6aa	best you try it.|`|jUqFz0mgaa	yes<br>  hgh is for real but you have to work out and tear you muscles as much as possible take from some that has took hgh injections. also you might put a couple inches in height on. i grew 7 inches in 2 month|`|lFLsbDZxaa	Do you have any reason to belive that it wasn't?<br>  <br>  You have the website and everything, come on ;)|`|VFhE8nBxaa	yes

I was the worst with dentists, my fear was dreadful. A friend of mine was a 4th year dental student and he suggested I let him do a filling for me. I don't know how he did it but he completely cured me of the fear. The students are under constant supervision. A root canal is not painful, don't listen to the hype. You will have plenty of anaesthetic and you won't feel a thing. I promise you I could have dropped off to sleep during a root canal once. You'll be fine.|`|Y6YrRo7Uaa	Wow i would take the day off if i were you, it takes at least a few hours to recover from a root canal, much more if anything goes wrong...|`|kHLwlNA5aa	It depends. Yes, it's going to hurt. You may not be able to work if you're given medication. You need to ask about this beforehand, not after.|`|9EmUPlJzaa	Pain , yes but its soon over , I wouldn't go to work afterwards , you will feel very fragile and need to rest .|`|psMZrXa7aa	I should imagine it wil feel a bit like this descriptive word...<br>  <br>  AAAAAAAAAARRRRRGGH!!!!|`|tGEMwgyBaa	You should not feel pain, if you do, always let the dentist/student know. A 4th year dental student has a lot more experience than you think. They have to do a perfect job in order to pass the procedure they are doing. And they just don't do it once or twice they have been doing it for awhile, especially if they are in their 4th year. You should be able to go to work, when you have a root canal done, they are taking the nerve out of the tooth, which means no nerve...no pain. You might be sore from keeping your mouth open for so long and the gums around the area might be sore from the rubber dam that they use to keep anything from falling down your throat. So it may be uncomfortable but it should not hurt. Good luck, I hope this helped!|`|OjDg4LW9aa	The student would not be doing your root canal if their overseer was not 100% confident they could do it, so do not worry about that.<br>  <br>  As far as the process goes, it's not so bad. You get a LOT of numbing shots, and the process id tedious. Seeing as they are taking the feeling out of your tooth, there isn't much pain afterwards. I would recommend taking the day off though, it's an ordeal.|`|PjyP8yEiaa	Well I hear they do everything by the book and have to have instructors check their work as they go step by step. Part of the downside of going to a dental school is that yes you may have pain and it will take all day. It will prob be sore, but everyone is different. Who knows they may be great and you wont have any discomfort.|`|M92DlyzDaa	If you don't have a tooth abcess it shouldn't hurt. It does hurt if you have a tooth abcess because the injections then won't numb you totally.|`|gFf8KiIIaa	DEFINATLEY going to have pain. not because the student is conducting the surgery though...because root canal is a painful expierance. but have fun with the vicodin

8Xbc4ok1aa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .

RXI8ImdIaa	I'm not familiar with codeine sulfate vs. codeine.<br>  <br>  I know that hydrocodone is a combination of codeine plus an NSAID. I think it's acetaminophen.<br>  <br>  Hydrocodone will be more powerful than codeine alone, because the 2 drugs combined provide a stronger effect than either would separately. You can get the same thing from taking codeine and tylenol pills separately, 10 mg and 1000mg respectively. It's the same thing.

n7BIleRFaa	I just had that a couple of months ago.  If you have a lot of red bumps on you stomach and back and it itches like crazy you probably have it.  I first noticed bumps on my stomach. I went to the doctor the next couple of days and I had it. Hydrocortisone 1% helped a little. So did Avenno Oatmeal Bath mix helped. But, then after that It still itched like crazy. I had to go back to the doctor and get 2 prescriptions that helped 1000 times more than to other stuff. It went away in a little over three weeks. It is most common in people ages 10-35.  Don't worry it will go away.  Also, when you take a shower use lukewarm water.( the rash itches more when it is overheated.) Hope this helps!|`|HgFx9Hfqaa	There is no known cause or cure for it, but it does go away eventually on its own.

Usually when you have an infection your lymph nodes or node will swell to fight the infection or wound. You have two lymph nodes on the underside of your neck under your jaw, if you feel the other side of your jaw opposite the lump you may feel another small lump exactly like it but not as swollen. If it is or isn'ta lymph node you should recieve medical attention as soon as you can.  It could be a number of things, all lumps require some concern.  There could also be something going on with your thyroid gland as well.  Go to your doctor, until then you won't find out what it is.|`|q411DXsFaa	Yea, its possibly a swollen lymph node|`|FebNOmqDaa	You might gross out of what I have to say but we used to put a vinegar on this spot back in the old days.

It drains the lower lip, floor of mouth, teeth, submental salivary gland, tip of tongue, skin of cheek. Common causes of enlargement include mononucleosis syndromes, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, dental pathology such as periodontitis. <br>  <br>  Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'. <br>  <br>  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter. An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant - nodes that continue to grow in size are important and those that regress in size tend to be more reassuring. If your nodes remain less than 1cm in size and no other symptoms arise you are "considered" safe. But, if you are concerned or anything new should arise you should contact your Doctor.  Seriously, it is probably nothing - but, be safe and see your Doc - it is better to be safe then sorry - Good Luck and think positive!
8NZC6LsRaa	its normal, as long as it doesn't come out looking brownish or greenish (because that means its an infection) and the discharge is not curdled..(look like cottage cheese or some kind of curdled milk - that's a yeast infection).

fLsXT4t1aa	Sounds like you're stressed out and homesick.Don't take any medication to help you sleep, you'll be drowsy and dizzy the next day. If you're open to this kinds of stuff you may try learning some breathing techniques to help you relax and feel better before going to bed. Basic yoga positions are always a good way to let your body rest and take your mind off of things. However, if this is too loony for you I find that a strong chamomile tea before bed is nice. Exercise during the day so you'll be tired by night, this is always a good routine. Try to have some comfort food that reminds you of your mother and talk to people when you're homesick. Don't keep it to yourself if you're feeling down. Your sister and you might want to try chat when you're on bed. You may not be asleep but at least you'll be resting, relaxed and thinking positive things with her. Also, don't use some else's phone without permission.I understand that this is a hard situation for you but if your cousin doesn't approve, don't do it. Best luck to you and your sister.|`|7cGcdmQYaa	Pray before you lay down...seriously EVERY TIME.|`|16f8H4alaa	awww i'm sorry about this<br>  just make sure your tired before to bed and write down your thoughts before you go to bed so your not thinking about them all night.|`|BBTnM1p7aa	Read something VERY BORING don't stop have the light on and eventually you'll fall a sleep, trust me thats what i do EVERY night =]

Oh and I know you might get a lot of answers about how you have herpes, but this is not herpes. People don't know the difference between canker sores and cold sores (which are herpes). You have a canker sore (not herpes, not contagious) because cold sores aren't found inside the mouth. Just so you don't get worried! :)

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|Rk46lIBwaa	Generally you don't and if you do you put it back FAST!<br>  <br>  Lifestyle changes which involve BOTH diet and exercise are essential to sustain and maintain weight loss.

I read it in a magazine somewhere but eggs actually help you!<br>  For lunch/dinner, I usually eat subways. Veggie delight is the best. I order Italian herbs and cheese, put swiss cheese, toasted, lettuce, tomato, onions, (light) mayo, and vinegar.<br>  <br>  The point is, you've got to cut the junk food. If you want to lose weight, cutting junk food will help immensely. Instead of candy and sweets, eat an orange or an apple! Strawberries and raspberrys are good too. Also, cut the soda and FLAVORED (which is FAKE SUGARED JUICE) juice! Replace it with lots of water, and some milk once in a while. If you want something sweet to drink, drink Tropicana Orange Juice. From my experience, that's the only REAL juice I've seen out there. Once in a while, I drink pomegranate juice too. <br>  <br>  Also, I now have a habit in looking at the package for the calories. I can only limit myself into comsuming 2000 calories a day.<br>   <br>  Oh, and you can find out if juice is not real juice by looking at the bottle. Usually they put it in tiny letters so you won't find out. But its fake if it says Flavored.<br>  <br>  & of course, you HAVE to excercise. Try walking up flights and flights of stairs. Walk the long way home (if its safe of course!) or dance crazily to your music (I do that, its fun AND healty).<br>  <br>  WARNING: Do not starve yourself! I repeat, DO NOT STARVE YOURSELF!

Lunch, 6 inch veggie delight or turkey or oven roasted chicken from subway on wheat for lunch. Small snack like nuts or fruit for late PM. Dinner: chicken or Fish or wheat Pasta, any green veggie, brown rice/carrots. Real low calorie after that.<br>  <br>  Weight watchers has a great cookbook. I will actually use it once I lose my last 20....If Ever!!!|`|A5nZFjEoaa	Some people can change their diet and drop weight like that! Others actually have to work out. you're probably the type that has to work out.
44fe68ac48e4256fe9ab6ffbd1ee8375aa	It'll hurt for about a good week and then it will slowly go back to normal and you'll feel like you felt before. Cut up your food into really little pieces and chew on your very back molars and drink lots of milkshakes and eat lots of soup! Whenever it gets too painful to handle, take an Advil (Not Tylenol because Advil is an anti-inflammatory and will reduce the swelling of your mouth too). I would reccomend taking one before bed because when you wake up in the mornings it can get pretty sore! Use the wax the orthodontist gave you, it will save you from many hours of misery from bleeding lips, gums and tongues!  It will only get better so don't let it get you down too much! For the future: Take an Advil before you go for a tightening, it will hurt BAD if you don't!) :)|`|Ek3MtNVfaa	I got braces last year an i still have them now. But trust me its get really easy!!!

9vBqgoDfaa	Some people have phosphenes with migraine. Phosphenes are defined as a sensation of light caused by excitation of the retina by mechanical or electrical means rather than by light, as when the eyeballs are pressed through closed lids. Depending on the migraine these may be small lateral lights or completely blind both eyes.<br>  But, the excitation of the retina is an excitation of the brain. When it is severe, it may be a sign of another problem that hasn′t been diagnosed.<br>  You should have your eyes checked and, if possible, consult with a neurologist.|`|KKev7q04aa	Sometimes, when you have migranes, you can have very wierd and scary visual phenomina occur, you might want to get it checked out, just in case.|`|umca7pwoaa	It sounds a lot like a ocular migraine.

The visual disturbances usually last about 5 to 30 minutes and you may experience pressure behind your eye.<br>  <br>  However, it could be something more serious like retinal detachment or a blood clot in your eye which requires immediate attention. I would get it checked out just to be safe.|`|p27jMTFuaa	It could be a migraine but if you have any other symptoms in the next day or two then go to an Optometrist immediately as it could be something dangerous that needs emergency attention.|`|kkM8vFfKaa	You may very well need glasses or contacts. I'll be 19 next month. I thought I had wonderful vision, when in reality I went to the eye doctor and I needed glasses for almost all the time.<br>  Your eyes get so used to straining all the time, that you don't even notice you're straining to see at all. Go for a checkup at your eye doctor. Tell them about what happened. I guarantee you need glasses.<br>  <br>  P.S. Something similar happened to my twin sister a couple of days ago. She said for about 10 minutes one of her eyes had blurred vision. She said she was laying on her side and he eye was kinda squished on the bed, and when she got up she couldn't read or see anything. She said after she put her glasses on it went away like 10 minutes later.<br>  <br>  Go to your eye doctor. You really probably need glasses.
TuheGzLkaa	Those are the side effects. If you stop it you should bleed some but i suggest you keep taking it until the side effects wear off. I'm pretty positive that you will have side effects from all hormonal birth control methods. I had side effects from yaz for about a week and even threw up. Now i have no problems with it.

Please go and talk to your GP about the side effects and read the material contained in the packet.  Your GP needs to know if you are experiencing severe side effects as they can be serious.  You can also get the prescription changed through your doctor.  Best see your doctor for this one.|`|vpClQW4xaa	It could take over a month for your body to get used to being on birth control. <br>  <br>  Just try making it through this month's pack.

Use smaller sized tampons when your flow is lighter. TSS occurs more often when super-absorbent tampons are used. Don't use these unless your menstrual flow is particularly heavy.<br>      * Alternate between pad and tampon use. You might want to use pads at night, and tampons in the daytime.<br>      * Wash your hands before inserting or taking out your tampon.<br>      * Don't use tampons to absorb anything other than your menstrual flow.

Just do it slowly and gently or you will have problems, don't get tense or it will be harder to do.
K1BMovMTaa	You have to make sure you are combining excercise AND diet. If you are ingesting 3000 calories a day and working out, you won't see a difference. Reduce your calorie and fat intake, and maintain your workouts, and you will see your weight drop significantly.
SltEwVX7aa	it's possible for both to occur.<br>  <br>  usually, it's just a small section of intestine that's affected.  But, if left unchecked, the 'dead' part of the intestine will spread infection and bacteria to the rest of the intestine, and it really becomes a problem then.<br>  <br>  it's also possible that when the intestine is strangulated, that it could limit blood flow into that side of the scrotum.

It was quite uncomfortable and caused me anxiety as it seemed to worsen with time.<br>  I researched the problem online and came upon Indian Health Guru Consultant’s website. I wanted the procedure as soon as possible. The staff at the surgical facility were so competent and kind I was astounded. The procedure was done on time, quickly and efficiently and with great kindness and dignity. The total time was les than 20 minutes. I had minimal pain during the first eight hours and none thereafter. There was virtually no bleeding, scab or scarring. I flew 1000 miles two days after the surgery and spent a few days sightseeing and visiting with my son. Seven days after the procedure I want back to full work. I have functioned normally since then with no effects from the operation except the relief from the discomfort, anxiety and risk of the hernia. Fourteen days after the surgery I ran three miles and used weights at the gym, including squats.<br>  I am so grateful to Indian Health Guru Consultant’s treatment and care.

I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.

If it's that, then it'll probably go away with time. <br>  <br>  Neck pain can be a cause of spinal injury, although this is unlikely as you would have some other obvious symptom. Your best bet would be going to a doctor or a free clinic.
XNc5moJEaa	They had this for a school in TX. Similar to the exam to get in to Nursing school.  It was impossible for me to find any study guides, so I was told to get the study guide for the nursing school entry exam and that it wasn't much different.  I'll admit, I lived in another state at the time who didn't administer the HOBET anywhere and I would have had to flown in to take it, so I decided to not apply there.  I ended up going to a school where I didn't have to take it.
BTI0XOptaa	Yes head lice prefer clean hair because it is easier for them to move around and easier for them to lay their eggs. But head lice do not live for long off the human head so they will live in whatever hair they can find at the time. <br>  <br>  Don't  worry too much just yet. If there is no infestation, don't go treating your grand daughter with pesticide treatments. Not only is this an overwhelmingly drastic measure, chemical head lice treatments are not meant to work in this way.<br>  <br>  Get yourself some tea tree oil from your local health food store and mix 10 drops of it in with some water into a spray bottle. You can also mix it with some leave in conditioner. This will repel any live lice. Straighten her hair with a hot iron, this will pop any nits.<br>  <br>  You really don't have to worry too much about it until you find live lice in her hair. Until then take these prevention methods and she should be fine.<br>  <br>  If you have an infestation, please see the following website for more articles and information.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|E87JwnACaa	lice love hair that has been washed.

eQCsKq4jaa	Alprazolam (Xanax) has a half life of about 6.3mg in young healthy people, with 11-12 hours being an average. That being said, the peak concentration in the body occurs within 1-2hrs. So if you are drinking 8hrs later you will be fine. And no matter what many say, having a drink or two is fine for most people. And the Xanax will be mostly (if not fully) gone. And Xanax only works for around 4hrs. So the sedation will be gone by the tie you go drinking.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|F4DhYjlnaa	It's really not a good idea to ever take xanax and drink on the same day because it can cause black outs.

I think it's the fact that you are trying to resist touching it that is making you even more uncomfortable about not touching it. For example, DO NOT think of an elephant.<br>  <br>  Everyone has these to a certain extent. For example, I need to check several times if a door in my house is locked, even though I've checked it the first time. It's only when it gets too severe that you should get it checked out. There was once a woman that was so obsessed with cleanliness, she would scrub the floor, walls and roof of a room to keep it clean, and would open doors with her foot because she didn't want to touch the door knob.<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about it, and no nothing is wrong with you.|`|F4DhYjlnaa	Agreed - might be OCD.

ZuYTZ80Gaa	A similar entity to alzheimer's is vascular dementia, which is I think what youre trying to describe.  It is caused by chronic ischemic (lack of proper bloodflow)  changes to the brain over time, and is usually seen in people who have had strokes/heart attacks/diabetics/bad peripheral vascular disease (as these are the people who have bad blood vessels).<br>  <br>  It usualy looks like alzheimer's but instead of having a gradual decrease in function, they tend to have a stepwise decline, staying stable, deteriorating, staying stable at that level, and deteriorating agian.  <br>  <br>  This may be what you're descibing, as well, alzheimer's and vascular dementia can overlap and produce a mixed dementia which looks different from the typical alzheimer's picture.|`|cftWwsidaa	it was by the strokes ahlzheimers effects ur mind|`|q411DXsFaa	one type of mini stroke can also be related to the brain it is called a  (Transient ishemic attack)<br>  <br>  <br>   Alzheimer's disease always gets worse over time, but how quickly this happens varies. Some people lose the ability to do daily activities early on. Others may still do fairly well until much later in the disease.<br>  <br>  Mild memory loss is common in people older than 60. It may not mean that you have Alzheimer’s disease. But if your memory is getting worse, see your doctor. If it is Alzheimer’s, treatment may help. <br>  <br>  What are the symptoms?<br>  For most people, the first symptom of Alzheimer's disease is memory loss. Often the person who has a memory problem does not notice it, but family and friends do. But the person with the disease may also know that something is wrong.<br>  <br>  As the disease gets worse, the person may:<br>  <br>  Have trouble making decisions. <br>  Be confused about what time and day it is. <br>  Get lost in places he or she knows well. <br>  Have trouble learning and remembering new information. <br>  Have trouble finding the right words to say what he or she wants to say. <br>  Have more trouble doing daily tasks like cooking a meal or paying bills. <br>  The symptoms of Alzheimer’s get worse slowly over time. A person who gets these symptoms over a few hours or days or whose symptoms suddenly get worse needs to see a doctor right away, because there may be another problem.<br>  <br>  As people with Alzheimer’s get worse, they may get restless and wander, especially in late afternoon and at night. This is called sundowning. Over time, they may also start to act very different. They may withdraw from family and friends. They may see or hear things that are not really there. They may falsely believe that others are lying, cheating, using them, or trying to harm them. They may strike out at others.<br>  <br>  Later, they may not be able to take care of themselves. They may not know their loved ones when they see them. They may forget how to eat, dress, bathe, use the toilet, or get up from a bed or a chair and walk<br>  Cause<br>  The cause of Alzheimer's disease is not clear, and it is likely there are several causes of this condition. Alzheimer's disease causes changes or deterioration in certain areas of the brain that control thinking, communication, and behavior. Some of the deterioration may be related to a loss of chemical messengers in the brain (neurotransmitters)—acetylcholine, in particular—that allow nerve cells in the brain to communicate properly.<br>  <br>  It is not clear why these changes in the brain occur, but they are a major focus of Alzheimer's research. Although most people who have Alzheimer's disease do not have a family history of the condition, you are at increased risk for the condition if a member of your family has it.<br>  <br>  Some theories have suggested that metals, such as zinc or aluminum, play a role in Alzheimer's disease, but research has not found much evidence to support these theories. Experts agree that there is no reason to leave zinc out of your diet or to avoid items that contain aluminum, such as cooking utensils or soda pop cans.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mini strokes-<br>  <br>  there exist 2 types of stroke: Ischemic stroke, the multiple routine type of stroke, and also hemmorhagic stroke. A transient ischemic attack (Transient ishemic attack), sometimes dubbed a "mini-stroke", remains a temporary interference with blood flow to the brain. The second kind of stroke is a hemorrhagic stroke, in which a blood vessel bleeds and ruptures or hemorrhages. Hemorrhagic stroke accounts for approximately 20 percent of strokes, and is chiefly linked with high blood pressure or hypertension. How a stroke attacks a person depends on the portion of the brain in which the injury occurs. Stroke is a quick loss of brain operation started by an interruption in the availability of blood to the brain. Because it is primarily a disorder of the brain, stroke could impact the whole mind and body. Even though most strokes occur without warning, there are physical signs that may signal one are having a stroke. signs of stroke grow suddenly. there exist many times rather specific warning Symptoms of a potential stroke. By distinguishing the announcement Symptoms and creating action, you may be able to prevent a stroke or reduce its degree. Just detailed physical examination and medical imaging produce information on the existence, type, and amount of stroke. Given stroke as a major disorder, some individuals tend to totally discard the topic of 'Mini Stroke Warning Signs'.|`|EMbaak9waa	I give this to you short and simple.<br>  Its the strokes that would of done it to her as Alzheimer's effects the mind.<br>  <br>  Hope i have helped.
RbABRTxuaa	I lost nearly 40 pounds in a mere month by starving myself, using the treadmill everyday for more than an hour, and drinking only water.<br>  <br>  I went from 180 to 140 pounds and although everyone was really happy to see the new me, I was really depressed and became antisocial because everyone just stared at my body and not my face or personality. The feeling of confidence nad control was good, but never satisfying. My period stopped for 5 months and at first I thought I was pregnant. It was really scary becuase I had suicide thoughts and nervous breakdowns if I allowed myself a piece of sugar gum. <br>  <br>  I would never recommend this to anyone. It takes a toll on you emotionally and mentally. And a year afterwards, I gained all the weight back (which is actually normal for my height and stature), and thank goodness, my good-natured, happy personality returned. <br>  <br>  If there are any girls out there who don't feel pretty becuase they don't fit into the social norm of a skinny, beautiful cover model, don't beat yourself up like I did. You can be sexy and outgoing without having "the body" eveyone talks about.<br>  <br>  I encourage healthy eating habits and attending the gym. It makes you feel good about yourself and you gain alot of energy and encouragement from the people around you. Have a positive attitude and if you have decided to lose weight, take your time and do it the right way. I ended up with alot of health problems after my mistake (when I work out hard my face turns red but the skin around my mouth turns yellow, and I have heart abnormalities now becuase of exessive exercise)<br>  <br>  Good luck to all and remember- be yourself and make positive choices that won't cause a devestating effect on your health and relationships in the future.|`|STQuFtaYaa	ive lost weight fast by barely eating but it comes right back, its better to cut out foods one at a time and eat healthy|`|3SNhXpf0aa	I was 228 lbs in August last year, and I am now 192. I cut out all sweets/sodas, ate 1500-1800 calories a day, and did some light cardio, such as walking/jogging. The first two months I lost 15 lbs, the next month and a half I lost 17, and It's taking me longer to lose weight now because my body is adapting to my new habits.<br>  <br>  Change up whatever you are doing every month or so to keep weight loss optimum.|`|AA11953398	Everyone has done the yo-yo dieting. If you are looking for a quick fix try fasting for two days (only drinking liquid), this will let all the crap out of your body so you can start fresh. Then go on a low calorie diet while doing some sort of exercise activity...it will have you feeling great in no time. This is not recommended for long term weight loss.<br>  <br>  Also, one summer I ate nothing but turkey and cottage cheese (definetly not recommended), but I lost 30 lbs that summer. Let it be known that I was also taking an energy booster to help me along the way. It worked for awhile, but definetly not a long term weight loss.|`|n4uffXEtaa	no, no, and no, it sucked, i did a water fast for 2 days and only lost like 5 stupid pounds, and i really need 2 loose weight. so it ******* sucked. i still felt disgustingly fat, even when my jeans felt looser. <br>  u don't think u can give me some fasting tips, do u?<br>  another thing, those other's who say it is water weight, and that they gain it all back are wrong, u dont gain weight back. u might gain 2 pounds when u loose seven pounds, u just have to be careful when u break the fast|`|tPpn8nbKaa	Last year i lost 30 pound in about 3 months by eating about 6 small meals a day to increase my metabolism, drinking plenty of water, and running at least 2 miles a day. And yes i was able to keep that weight off. Now i am 16 and have pecs and abs and i look amazing no lie. I have put 10 pounds back on but its not fat its all muscle lol. So now i weigh 135 and look amazing. I love my results.|`|mlaLgoaSaa	yeah. i ate only 400 calories/day, for 3 days and exercised twice/day for those days. i lost 7 lbs. i got sick. it sucked. then i started eating normally again and the weight came back, plus 2 lbs... ha ha anytime you lose weight over a really small period of time, its just water weight. it will come back the moment you go back to your normal habits. i would not suggest it. ever.|`|W3wMtucgaa	um...I lost weight from being sick (I went from 94 to 88) from the stomach flu...I kept it for about a week or two and of course, I did not like the results of the stomach flu lol
6QEiuz7Naa	Or try anti perspiring deodorant it will reduce the "wetness"<br>  By plucking under you arms you could also be irritating the sweat glands and this could be causing you to sweat more then usual. So you might like to try waxing. Less painful then plucking as it is all off in one strip.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  (:|`|mIj2EtY5aa	just saying, Secret Clinical Strength deoderant works incredibly!<br>  <br>  <br>  prevents sweating and smells good. =]<br>  <br>  hope i helped.<br>  [=|`|mKirpWOgaa	omg i get it sooo bad..like whether it is cold or hot  i sweat so bad... i found this deodorant called certain dri.and it works better than anything ive ever tried(and ive tried everything)...there is a day here and there i sweat a little bit but not enough to really know...u should def. try it...|`|ItmXFmMIaa	I do know if you go to a dermatologist(a skin doctor) they can help you with that problem easily and without any pain at all.|`|KuVNm4R2aa	deodorant and perfume :)|`|8NZC6LsRaa	Well I use Dove deodorant which is MAGIC...but you may need to try to clinical strenth deodorant!|`|EOK7eBu1aa	Okay I have the same problem....so I totally understand.....Those other people don't know what they are talking about!<br>  <br>  okay one way that might help you is to take a shower at night then apply the deodorant and use the clinical stuff.<br>  The next day put on some more, then you should be good for the day.<br>  It really helped me putting it on at night ( I have no idea why, but it did)<br>  If this does not help at all, you may want to get checked out.|`|QzdsPwIgaa	try deodorant.

I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.

mlaLgoaSaa	i used hydroxycut for a while combined with diet and exercise, and got pretty good results...<br>  <br>  just so you know, neither of these pills "burns fat"... they give you energy in the form of caffeine, and "suppress" appetite by combining herbs and caffeine... they aren't good for you, and may cause permanent damage to your metabolism...|`|iEuRY0QXaa	Ya i've messed with a lot of diet pills.. They can REALLY screw up your heart to the point you have to eat to recover... defeating any purpose.. Not to mention your heart is kinda vital for living.. Try liquid hoodia, it tastes good, filled with nutrients, suppresses appetite, gives you a natural energy/fat burning boost.|`|NK9Qc46Paa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|KdyXwVg9aa	get off your fat butt and move more...seriously.

My record was about 8-10. Think I was abstinant the next day! Its practice for sex so that you don't chuck your muck before the girl has even touched the little fellow. That will F**k your head  up and confidence, like most things is massive when it comes (excuse the pun) to sex. I have had many satisfied f**k-buddies and don't mind admitting I kinda enjoyed myself.(Getting a girl to get you off is great, but thers a lot to be said for satisfying her though, sence of accomplishment, making someone you care about happy, bring you closer and more intamate,trust etc, but most of all, YOU DA MAN!!! Whos the Daddy? YOU THE DADDY) It makes you feel like you have accomplished what a man has to do going back to our ancesters and only the strongests, fittest and/or cleverest got to mate with the girl, so the next generation is the best it can be. So w*nk away and impress the ladies or don't and discover sex together with that special someone. Choices, life is series of choices, and they have consequences, good, bad and indifferant.<br>  Porn can falesly raise your expectations of what a normal girl is like. They use fit models and all sorts of tricks eg lighting, to give the hottest girls. They are all competing to sell their porn. So use it but use your imagination as well, like a girl you know and like and have a chance with. Just dont tell her you thrap yourself silly over her, women find it disgusting/peculiar/wierd, I dunno.

KqxQlPrNaa	There is a condition referred to as "anger seizures" in the psychiatric world.  It is usually accompanied by bipolar disorder and is a "side effect" if you will of bipolar.  It is common to be triggered by alcohol or drug use but it can be treated.  The treatment usually involves a visit to a psychiatrist and typically they will put you on a mood stabilizer and possibly an anti-psychotic as well.  Sometimes they will also try anti-depressants depending upon what type of bipolar is involved (I II or III, etc...)   Anger seizures are very much like drunken blackouts.  Be careful though, because I personally believe it is in this state that most crimes of passion are committed!
oThixZeBaa	I'll tell you about my experience. Nuvaring is millions of times easier than the ring - nothing to remember every day, you can't feel it, and much fewer side effects than the pill (oh the nausea.... the bloating!)<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, I was very dry "down there" and my sex drive tanked. That's the only reason I don't use it anymore, and it's a real shame because until I figured out that the ring had killed my drive (about a year) it seemed like the best form of birth control out there. That said, not all women get this side effect.|`|ItmXFmMIaa	I think that it is a risk worth taking. if you like having unprotected sex you should get the NuvaRing. I dont think that you would like to be pregnant at your age. Listen to your mom and get the NuvaRing. Alot of times they just put those side affects on the side and over half the time nothing ever happens. Just listen to your mom its a deal worth taking.

Some suggest you wait a month. I don't think 7 hours late will affect it that much, the only part that concerns me is that you have only been taking it for 11 days. If you had been taking it for at least a month, then I would say don't worry about it as I used to take mine late sometimes and never got pregnant. However, depending on your answer to question 1, you should maybe go get it just in case.|`|M8a4Qe2Maa	I wouldn't take it to be honest. That's smart of you to be using a condom in conjuction with the pill though. Generally it is pretty safe to have sex without a condom or anything after the first week of starting birth control (this is what my doctor told me). Though, doctors recommend waiting a full month just to be super safe, but a week is still okay too. If you were 7 hours late though, it does increase your chance of being pregnant but I think you will be okay.|`|MfXiWkMTaa	i take the pill (ortho tricyclen) and never use a condom...i have yet to get pregnant. dunno if that helps.

AA10626373	You should first write a note to the insurance company that's denied you and ask them to send a copy of their lab results to your own doctor.  Don't despair by the way.

It is constantly working to break down not only the environmental and external toxins that invade our body through breathing and eating, but also those produced during normal metabolic processes in the body called internal toxins. Many common symptoms such as headaches, mental confusion, muscle pain, fatigue, poor coordination, nerve problems, skin irritations and emotional imbalances can be a result of over exposure to toxins. If liver function can be improved the entire body will benefit.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best of luck!
gCdP3NJGaa	Welcome to our world........ it can be fairly grubby here, can't it?! <br>  Seriously though, learn to develop a bit of  thick skin and pity the sad fools that need to get their kicks in that way.

7Qy385Gtaa	Psychiatrist is a doctor from medical viewpoint and can give you pills, electroshock or brain surgery which are the only methods psychiatry uses. Brain surgeries like prefrontal lobotomy found its place in horror movies where it belongs and is disappearing from psychiatry. Electroshocks are still being given to the people despite no results and serious damage caused to the patients. Modern psychiatry focuses on drugs. Psychiatrists prescribed LSD and ecstasy as medicine in the past and their modern drugs are said to be even more dangerous. Some psychiatrists however may be using alternative methods or psychology but that is not psychiatry. Psychiatry has been using 1) brain surgeries 2) shocks (not only electroshocks but also insulin shocks) 3) drugs.<br>  I wouldn’t play with psychiatry at all - see the vids below.<br>  <br>  A must see new document - story told by psychiatrists, psychologists and other professionals - it CAN save your life<br>  <a href="http://www.cchr.org/#/videos/making-a-ki..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cchr.org/#/videos/making-a-ki...</a><br>  <br>  Alternatively<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPUHUpfDV..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPUHUpfDV...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHu7Ik361..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHu7Ik361...</a><br>  <br>  school<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABmVOS..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABmVOS...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSZ9YTnSk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSZ9YTnSk...</a>|`|Rk46lIBwaa	You ask, as you are entitled to do, for a second opinion.

HsX4H0FLaa	You seem to be listing side-effects, some are which are covered by the Black Box warning on the drug. They are supposed to be explained to the patient/patient's family, since daily monitoring is recommended. Sexual dysfunction is common; manic and agitation/aggressive/emotional blunting type of effects would possibly cover the rest. Confusion is a side-effect, but can be tied into some of the others.<br>  <br>  I've linked you below to a site where you can access the info relevant to the drug, including the 'Patient Info', but please also read the Warnings, Consumer, and Side-Effects pages.|`|d6fa994e64f1d1e826663cbb1b3de20caa	That drug is known for people not feeling any emotions. Get off of it immediately.
mlaLgoaSaa	You need a balanced diet and a fitness routine. Here is what I would suggest:<br>  <br>  1. Change your diet. Try and obtain most of your calories from complex carbohydrates (this will give you energy and keep you feeling full). Remember, you lose fat by burning more calories each day than you consume. Example: If you burn 2000 calories each day just by existing, and burn 300 more through exercise, eat less that 2300 calories. Never skip breakfast. Snacks are fine as long as they are healthy. Examples: fresh fruit and veggies, rice crisps, peanuts, yogurt, etc...) Also, little things will help tons! Like, switch to skim milk, eat low fat yogurt, use cooking spray instead of oils, opt for the low fat foods, eat whole grain bread... All these things will help a lot. <br>  <br>  2. Drink AT LEAST 8 (8oz) glasses of water each day. The more water you drink the better. Especially if you are working out.<br>  <br>  3. Try and do 20-40 minutes of continuous cardio exercise (jogging, speed walking, elliptical, biking) every day, at least 3 times per week (the more days you can do this, the better).<br>  <br>  4. Create a weight training schedule. Try to do some general strength training exercises at least 3 times per week. Remember, muscle burns fat. So, the more lean muscle tissue that is on your body, the faster you will burn fat.<br>  <br>  5. Stretch! This will help to lengthen and tone your muscles. Some studies even show that it can help to prevent injury. It also feels awesome!<br>  <br>  It sometimes takes about 8-12 weeks after starting a weight loss regime to see results (depending on the intensity of your fitness plan). So be patient, and keep with it! It will pay off.<br>  <br>  And, here is a sample of a nutritious meal plan:<br>  <br>  Breakfast:<br>  1 cup raisin bran w/ skim or soy milk<br>  1 banana<br>  <br>  Snack: <br>  1 handful of nuts<br>  <br>  Lunch:<br>  Turkey on whole wheat w/ lettuce, tomato, and mustard, 1 slice provolone cheese<br>  1 cup broccoli, steamed w/ seasoning<br>  1 orange<br>  <br>  Snack: <br>  1/2 cup low fat cottage cheese or low fat yogurt<br>  <br>  Dinner:<br>  4 oz. lean chicken breast, grilled or baked<br>  3/4 cup brown rice, steamed<br>  1 cup peas or carrots, steamed<br>  <br>  Dessert:<br>  1 serving fat free, sugar free pudding or fat free frozen yogurt<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|FoxTcv4Zaa	160|`|XLnboFslaa	It doesnt work like that. you also have to eat less and exercise.
XYAaRG1Baa	you grow outside of the gym, so by going everyday you are ripping your muscles more and more, and not giving them enough time to rebuild. at least work out every other day, if you are doing the same thing. here's what i do and it's been getting results for me:<br>  Day 1: chest, triceps, shoulders<br>  Day 2: back, biceps, legs (and calves)<br>  Day 3: off<br>  then repeat|`|cEHgmfmiaa	Exercise is good, it tells your body that you need more energy and raises your metabolism, the problem may occur if you slip or let go of your exercise completely.  If you quit the vigorous exercise, make sure you reduce your food intake as without exercise all that extra calories will be converted to fat.<br>  <br>  My opinion is that you do not need vigorous exercise as part of your healthy lifestyle.  Simply because, you will need to maintain it forever. If you are doing this for the short-term (losing weight) it's great, but definately not a lifetime thing.|`|Em47d1miaa	Ease up, you gotta give your muscles time to build up. Muscles grow by tearing and repairing. If you keep ripping them without giving them time to grow back, its definitely hurting you. If you absolutely must work out everyday, try working on different parts of your every other day or so.|`|AYIEpXCOaa	It depends on what your split is. If you are going in everyday and bench pressing, than yes its going to hurt you. And you will be in the "over-training" zone, you don't want to be in that area. It happened to me, and its horrible. If you workout a different body part everyday you should be good. <br>  <br>  So if you do Legs (Quads, Hams., and Calves) on Monday, Chest on Tuesday, Back on Wednesday, Shoulders on Thursday, and Arms (Bi's, Tri's, and forearms) on Friday. You should be fine. It would be wise to find a workout split that has opposing body parts whenever lifting weight, e.g. push-pull. Hope that helps.|`|ktJRog7Taa	nno
EsvJ9ji3aa	Some people also don't use it because they are allergic to it. I don't know why they wouldn't use it because It's alcohol. It is not mandatory for staff to use it. If they don't want to use it then they are supposed to wash their hands in between patients. I just attended a lecture by the doctor that is head of the department that takes care of that stuff and that is what he said. Take Care and next time tell her to ask for a new nurse if it bothers her.|`|IM3QwSS2aa	a small factor as hand sanitizer doesn't kill that .01%.<br>  <br>  handwashing is the guaranteed way.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	I haven't come across this before. The use of alcohol gel is mandatory. <br>  <br>  The main problem we have in hospitals is cleanliness and the fact that certain forms of bacteria are now very resistant to antibiotics. The worse thing the NHS ever did was give the cleaning jobs to outside contractors. Hospitals used to employ their own cleaning staff who took pride in their work. That said, because of the new Hygiene measures that have been brought in to tackle the problem, it has got a lot better this last year or so. <br>  <br>  I thought it was against their religion to consume it not touch it? Lots of products have alcohol in it- including cosmetic facial washes and shampoo- they don't seem to have an issue using them? I hope the NHS or better still the NMC are not tolerating this behaviour. I am by no means racist but patient safety and infection control has to come first and if they don't like it or it is against their beliefs then they need to find a more appropriate job which tailors to their beliefs. We cannot compromise patient safety to fall in with their religion.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	I read about this in the papers but I haven't witnessed it at first hand. The answer is simple: The gel is there for a good reason and it's not acceptable that certain people do not use it. It's not acceptable that people contract life-threatening infections simply because muslims will not comply with hygiene regulations. If they cannot or will not do their job properly and are putting patients' lives at risk then they should be dismissed.|`|HG0742a9aa	i think the rise of infections in hospital stems from the fact that alot of the cleaning jobs were outsourced to agencies who employ people for very little money, and they do not do a thorough job of cleaning in the first place if at all.|`|Y3Fp6oKxaa	Hi there<br>  The rise in infections is due to the bacteria becoming resistant to the chemicals we have used for years to fight against them
XkqIW5mtaa	Okay, so this is from my experience.<br>  <br>  For breakfast, eggs are the best choice. I read it in a magazine somewhere but eggs actually help you!<br>  For lunch/dinner, I usually eat subways. Veggie delight is the best. I order Italian herbs and cheese, put swiss cheese, toasted, lettuce, tomato, onions, (light) mayo, and vinegar.<br>  <br>  The point is, you've got to cut the junk food. If you want to lose weight, cutting junk food will help immensely. Instead of candy and sweets, eat an orange or an apple! Strawberries and raspberrys are good too. Also, cut the soda and FLAVORED (which is FAKE SUGARED JUICE) juice! Replace it with lots of water, and some milk once in a while. If you want something sweet to drink, drink Tropicana Orange Juice. From my experience, that's the only REAL juice I've seen out there. Once in a while, I drink pomegranate juice too. <br>  <br>  Also, I now have a habit in looking at the package for the calories. I can only limit myself into comsuming 2000 calories a day.<br>   <br>  Oh, and you can find out if juice is not real juice by looking at the bottle. Usually they put it in tiny letters so you won't find out. But its fake if it says Flavored.<br>  <br>  & of course, you HAVE to excercise. Try walking up flights and flights of stairs. Walk the long way home (if its safe of course!) or dance crazily to your music (I do that, its fun AND healty).<br>  <br>  WARNING: Do not starve yourself! I repeat, DO NOT STARVE YOURSELF! Don't skip meals because once you eat again, you'll gain all the weight back (and possibly gain more). This is because of the metabolism that had depleted.<br>  <br>  I'm 14 by the way... and by following these rules, I lost 5 pounds in 2 weeks. Yeah, I use to be 120 lbs, but now I'm 110 lbs.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps? :)|`|5rn8OzwAaa	exercise, eat healthy such as granola bars, cereal fruits.|`|HhKOOX8zaa	just eat less.and run for 30 minutes at least 3 times a week.<br>  you should lose more then 10 pounds in 3 months.<br>  and don't eat so much junk.

I suggest you visit here www.icety.info/cashonline|`|pqyjmVCzaa	There are few honest ways to make money online. However, there is a lot of scam as well. <br>  <br>  Scenario that I find the worst is actually when there is a way, and they suck you into it only for you to find out that you were left to deal with it your self. So you know that this thing could work, but you don't know where to start. <br>  <br>  It happened to me before, many times. Fortunately, I did not give up because I wanted to learn how to generate some profit through Internet. I was not pulled in by the numbers they were throwing at me, I just wanted to make extra cash to have for holidays, to pay of my credit card, and I wanted a new motorbike. So, I kept looking...<br>  <br>  I found out that most of the Paid Survey companies can't generate even close to what I wanted. In addition, you receive so much junk into  your email that is not even funny. When you do get a proper survey, it does not guaranty that you are yet qualified to complete it. Most of the time you get cut off after few questions because you don't fit into the demographic profile they are after. Only one that worked for me was Lightspeed Panel, but it made me around $20.00 a week. I don't know about you but that is not what I had in mind. So, I moved on...<br>  <br>  I found these guys that promise you millions, and all you have to do is set up a website, activate it and it's all automated! Right. I wanted to know what do you promote on these websites, because it seamed that all you do is promoting the same thing to other people, the same website,just with your name on it, and that is how you make money. That's scam written all over it! Anyways, they never got back to me.<br>  <br>  Finally, about 3 months ago I stumbled onto something GOOD. I am not joking. This site is for real! It gives you actual blueprints how to set up an online campaign. The best thing is they are real people too. There is support forum, FAQ's, blog, members area. You can check it out on <a href="http://www.maverickblueprints.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.maverickblueprints.com/</a> <br>   <br>  These guys studied all possible ways and tools out there and now they formed a club where they mentor people to success. Yes, to success, not to unrealistic million figures. Everything is right there in one place. As I said, I joined three months ago, and I finally stopped looking for "the one" that works. I found it, and I am so happy! I just got back from holidays, I paid of my credit card, and I am buying a bike soon. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps,<br>  <br>     Mr Matt

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	As I explained in my last answer the results indicate that the patient has mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary congestion happens if the valve does not close properly, this causes blood to be pumped back into the left atrium when the left ventricle contracts. <br>  <br>  If the leak is large, it results in an increase in the pressure in the atrium. Hypertrophy of the wall of the atrium can occur and the atrium might dilate. A back pressure of blood may then cause congestion of blood in the pulmonary veins which bring blood to the left atrium from the lungs.<br>  <br>  The dizziness is due to the decreased C/O .|`|z6DIHEG3aa	i'm still in training and by training i of course mean high school classes and curiosity lol, but it sounds to me like endocarditis.|`|ZuYTZ80Gaa	Sounds like your patient has mitral regurgitation, the mitral valve is leaky, leading to backflow into the atrium (causing the enlargement). As well, an enlarged atrium is prone to arrythmias like atrial fibrillation.  Finally, the backup causes pulmonary congestion through the pulmonary circulation.<br>  <br>  Mitral regurgitation is a common valve defect seen in people with a history of rheumatic fever.|`|L2fGkm05aa	This sounds like my situation.

VCIZJQCJaa	The Gleason score "grades" tumors on the basis of how abnormal they look when the tissue is examined under a microscope. The more abnormal they look, the more likely they are to grow fast and to spread to other parts of the body. A grade of less than 4 generally means that cancer cells look similar to normal cells. Grades 5 to 7 fall under the intermediate range.

In one study, a Gleason score of 2 to 4 indicated about a 95 percent chance of survival at 15 years without aggressive treatment.|`|cftWwsidaa	sorry but i have no idea but i think the chances are pretty low|`|2dxBxg5vaa	Hi,<br>      I was 62 when I had a PSA of 4.7.  I had a biopsy taken with around 11 or 12 samples and the results where 5 or 6 where cancerous. My gleasen was a 5.  I had the prostate removed over 2 1/2 years ago and my psa after 2 months went to 0.0.  I'm checked ever 6 months now. By the way the prostate readings can go up over 200. <br>  <br>     The prostate cancer can spread to other parts of the body, that's why something has to be done. Once it gets into the other parts of the body it's harder to remove. <br>  <br>      Before he has the surgery he should have a digetal rectal exam. Also a biopsy which will tell a lot about the health of the prostate.|`|I5b4ZeZaaa	>Prostate Cancer Symptoms(2)<br>  Posted On Mar 1, 2009 at at 1:44 PM by Eddie    <br>  <br>  Prostate Cancer Symptoms(2)<br>  <br>  If the cancer is caught at its earliest stages, directorship men will not matter of fact any symptoms.

M7MrhmXXaa	anybody can lose weight.<br>  ur just not working out hard enough (u need to break a sweat)|`|ZRbTdQ6iaa	thats fine, everyone is different|`|gtAb94d2aa	You want to work on bringing up your cardio workouts to make that heart healthy first. It'll be easier to lose fat. Think of a 5 or 10 minute run, followed by a walk (uphill as you get more comfortable with it), then another sprint. Try to work in more running and constantly push yourself. The more you exercise the more endorphins released - Naturally the happier you'll be.<br>  <br>  Other than running there is tons you can do, yoga classes create a great relaxing environment for weight loss. Another option is Pilates, which is great for muscle building.<br>  <br>  Here are some food intake tips:<br>  <br>  -Drink lots of water<br>  <br>  -Spread your meals out and take in lots of veggies and vitamin boosting foods. This means eating regularly as opposed to the 3-meal/day routine.<br>  <br>  -Protein helps to maintain muscle mass which is important in the fat burning process. Good proteins can come from fish, shrimps, low fat cottage cheese, low fat yogurt, skimmed milk, and egg whites<br>  <br>  -Eat lots of fibre, it keeps that fullness feeling in your stomach to prevent giving into those cravings<br>  <br>  -There are good fats and bad fats. Consume the good ones. Think fish: Salmon, mackerel, herrings and sardines<br>  <br>  -Don't believe what you read about carbohydrates being bad for you, they can actually help you lose weight!<br>  <br>  -Stick to it!|`|VlxjNzgtaa	Nope :) as long as you don't see flobby baggage hanging about you are fine. I know muscles weigh more than fat, and when I started working out regularly I actually gained weight. I say don't worry about the weight. As long as you like what you see in the mirror, that's all that matters. However, if you think you are too bulky from heavy exercising, just try some stretching exercises and some dancing. Ballet Pilates is a good one for lean, elegant muscles.<br>  It also depends on your structure, some people are just more heavy built. I know two of my friends are both as tall, they are both in shape and they both look great but one weighs 20 pounds more than the other because she has broader shoulders and a bigger figure and all. The other is very, very slender. But like I said, both look great, they just have a different skeletal form. And by the way, don't always listen to the online scales where they give you what weight you should be for your height, it is a generalization for average people. But like for my slender friend, she is an adult but by that scale is underweight. However, she is healthy and doesn't starve herself.<br>  So yeah, if you look good, the weight doesn't matter :)|`|4DAOhKFLaa	If you aren't fat or chunky why are trying to lose weight?|`|OleVPkJgaa	thats because you dont need to :D|`|JpvX0ZY2aa	you probably have alot of mucsle and or bone weight.|`|gcatAUkdaa	Seriously if your not fat or anything than why are you bitc***?<br>  <br>  Jeez stupid question!
44fe68ac48e4256fe9ab6ffbd1ee8375aa	I broke a back bracket a week ago, but it's just loose, not sliding. How long until your next orthodontist appointment? I'm just going to wait it out and hope it won't get me in too much trouble. If it's really bad, then call your ortho and go in and they will fix it in no time. It won't cause too much harm if it's loose for a while though.|`|YhoUANPKaa	Ya that happended to me too, you can't really do anything about it, just get your orthodontist to fix it the next time you go.  Try not to play with it though, but if it does come completely off, that's OK.  I've had like four of my brackets come off, and all he did was glue on another one;  they have PLENTY of extra brackets with them.  So don't worry about it, it's fine.|`|wrJPYWlgaa	You can't do anything about it. Try not to play with it and go to your orthodontist as soon as possible to get it glued back on.

S0ZPErIfaa	my advice<br>  is to excersise<br>  dont eat less<br>  but excersise more<br>  what you need to do<br>  to lose weight<br>  is simple<br>  set a timer for 5 mins and do squats nonstop go at a slow pace but consistent one if you cant do 5 off the bat do 3 and get up to 5<br>  do this several times a day 5 mins of squats just do it at a light to moderate but continous pace then when you get better and see yourself losing weight you can lose more weight and now start conditioning yourself by doing as many squats as fast as you possibly can in 5 mins now that is very intense much more so then the simple thing i gave you for slight weight loss if you do that you will ******* drop the pounds theyll fly off and you will get very good conditioning for speed stamina and running at the same time also if you want to do the routine involving conditioning not just weight loss plus then its no longer a routine but a game a challenge try to beat your high score what i say does produce results and if you work for speed conditioning try it out do that for a month i guarantee you you will nhave phenomenal results|`|hyo4tWv9aa	lots of protein because it takes lots of work for the body to break down the protein( which means more calorie loss).

It takes patience to lose weight.|`|f9op7sEHaa	Eat your food with thought. Don't rush through your meal. When you are no longer hungry stop eating yuor meal. Don't stop when you are completely stuffed. When it comes to exersize do some pull ups or sit ups. Maybe buy some exersize videos. jog a few miles. (when you get the time) Instead when you going to have a snack don't eat a bag oh salty chips. Eat some veggies. Hope this helps! :)

Your cholesterol is high, but this most likely os because your thyroid is underactive.  Do a search for AACE and TSH and you should find info that supports you have an underactive thyroid.  Once your thyroid gets treated, the cholesterol level should decrease.|`|0nyWiro9aa	You need a free T4 test as the total T4 can be altered by other things besides thyroid.<br>  Assuming the thyroid hormones are normal then you would be classified as having subclinical hypothyroidism with a minimally elevated TSH.<br>  <br>  "Based on the evidence available at this time, the consensus<br>  panel recommended against routine treatment of<br>  patients with minimally raised serum TSH (4.5 to 10 mIU/<br>  liter).

Usually most physicians will only treat this if the patient has a TSH that's high (the normal can even go to 4.5-5) and a T4 that's low.
Kpn4FnuSaa	Well, it all depends on what the treatment and the doctor.  I had severe acne for 4 years and I have been to 3 dermatologists.  <br>  <br>  The first one gave me chemical peels that were to strong for my face and burned it.  (it hurt)  She also gave me about 5 different topical creams that didnt work as well as an oral antibiotic called adoxa.<br>  <br>  The second one i went to put liquid nitogen on my face to help with the acne.  (that didnt hurt and only takes a few min.)  She also gave me many more topical creams that didnt work and a oral antibiotic called minocyn.  <br>  <br>  The third one I went to FINALLY cleared up my face.  He gave me accuante.  And every 2-4 weeks i had to get my blood drawn and have "acne surgery"  (acne surgery is when the doctor pops all your pimples and it isnt pleasant.  That takes about 10 min) I also recieved more liquid nitrogen.<br>  <br>  But now after being on accuante for 6 months my skin is clear and i get no more than 1 tiny pimple a week.   Accutane makes your skin more sensitive to light and in general, but its nothing that lotion or sunscreen can not help.  <br>  <br>  Good luck at your appointment. :)

9MEcOGOvaa	Hello <br>  <br>  well defin. you should use something aerobic(that speeds up your heartrate).. like the stairmaster, treadmill, elliptical .. of which to keep ur tush and firm it up a bit.. <br>  <br>   now that being said i'd personally recommend the elliptical since it works out more (ur arms, thigh, butt, lower back, and arms) for ur time.. not to mention since it does that it helps you burn more calories for your time working out... <br>  <br>  maybe work out about 2hrs a week however you want to do .. like two days one hour each.. or maybe 4 days 30min each <br>  <br>  then when you find that your starting to stay longer without getting so tired.. add a little more time .. also ... unlike common misconception you could work out with wieghts and not look all bulk u cant look very musclar only lean yourself and tighten  (freeweights or machine) prob. since ur beginner i'd say machine weights..<br>  <br>  so the machine. like these-<br>   <a href="http://athletic-scholarships.net/gym%202.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://athletic-scholarships.net/gym%202...</a>  <br>  <br>  try do work with a weight lets say 5lbs in which u can do lets say 10 times (each time you do one lets it's called repetition-rep for short..so <br>  <br>  10 reps when you complete these reps thats called one set...<br>  <br>   then rest.. for about 10-15sec..<br>  <br>   then another 10 times.. (so ur starting on ur 2nd set.)<br>  <br>  etc.. for the first day and try to increase about 1 rep every time.. then when u about doubled the amount of reps.. increase the sets<br>  <br>  for ex. after a while u will do <br>  1set of 20<br>  2nd set of 20<br>  <br>  then u will add a third set.. and lets say increase it to 5 more reps.. then increase this one till it gets to 20 then and then once u have 3 sets of 20 reps.. or 4 u add more weight.. to lets say to 10lbs..<br>  <br>   and so on <br>  the key is to keep increasing when ur body adapts.. like in time when it comes to aerobic, and increase reps and weights and sets..|`|DnVeerYUaa	I was overweight until I used acai berry, I know they say that pills do not work, nevertheless they sure worked for me, and they have been shown on the Rachael Ray Show too.

It is a hard adjustment to be from a foreign country and come to the USA.  The cultures are different and so are the problems.  Don't take the way your "friends" treat you as some thing that is all your fault.  I have found that most people your age from the US have their own problems and issues they are trying to deal with.<br>  <br>  You are feeling some very typical emotions and stresses in your life.  Coming from another country is going to be even harder as their values are always different from yours. Your parents will not understand because their frame of reference will be vastly different than if they were from America originally.<br>  <br>  Killing yourself will not solve the problem, but I am glad you put the message on Y-answers which says to me you really don't want to hurt yourself.  Drop me a message and we can figure it out.
AA11440097	anything that doesnt seem "normal" gets labeled as a "disorder."  Let it be.  Most of these 'disorders" are bull.|`|mTSYemNgaa	I have a son and he was the exact same way when he was really young. I think it maybe a sign that he'll be more athletic.|`|pCbzhOrkaa	all kids are like that. seriously... dont worry|`|8LhEs3WLaa	It is possible but don't jump to conclusions. He may just be a healthy active little boy. Another thing to think of is what foods is he eating. Many foods can hype a child up. For example if my 6 yr & 8 yr olds drink Fanta, they literally start bouncing off the walls. I learnt that very fast and do not let them drink it at all. Coke and apple juice are other ones but not quite as severe. If you are concerned see a child nurse or paediatrician who can help eliminate these triggers to find the cause. Good Luck!

ZcJgYpE6aa	First you could try modifying your diet. EAT SPINACH (no joke) for iron. And find out what other foods are high on iron. Eat some daily.<br>  Do not eat junk,or fatty/fried/pre-prepared foods.Do some exercise daily,walk a mile or do whatever you enjoy (yoga? dance to your fav music?)<br>  Then,and only if there is no change in your mood and sleeping patterns ,consult a nutritionist.<br>  Leave your doctor as a last resort. He/she woul probably prescribe some drugs ,which would make you feel even more depressed. Good luck|`|AA10450066	Sounds like your anemic even though you are hungry your body needs to absorb the nutrients and vitamins from the food you eat or it will want more.There's a condition called pernicious anemia that fits your symptoms.Your doctor will refer you to another doctor that needs to take a bone marrow test to know whether you have it or not.You should make an appointment.I suggest that your not sleeping well due to the fact that your brain doesn't want to stop going through these problems wondering what is wrong.It'll really stressing you out.Stress reeks havoc on the heart.

As far as the irregular heart beat, You may also have High Blood Pressure, or if it's painful at all it may be a blood clot. You definitely need to see a doctor. Each of these problems has their own level of seriousness, and tests need to be done, to hopefully rule out anything fatal that may be on its way.|`|Xel3S1W5aa	I think you should go to the doctor. I recently had symptoms like this. The low iron is probably causing your heart to beat irregularly.

However don't over eat.<br>  You can eat a regular portion of food at each meal. If you are still hungry a little while from then. Have a healthy snack like fruits, nuts, or trail mix etc. Nothing like candy or ice cream between meals. As that robs the body of what it needs.<br>  You can also drink things like grapefruit juice about a 1/2 hour before your meals to help curb your appetite for you.<br>  Then if you can you should not sit down right after you last meal but walk a bit or  get outside. To move around. As often when sitting down and doing nothing after a meals . It causes food not to settle well. So moving around a bit helps the blood circulate better and the gastric juices do what they should, the way they are meant to work. As it help to lessen indigestion also.|`|a44bdf9ab4b4445fd8c12378bca3da45aa	drinking 2 full cups of water just before you eat will help fill you up, so you feel fuller when you eat less.

If so then get her a warm wash cloth and wipe her mouth when she throws up. You could also try getting a clod wash cloth and letting it sit on her head.

On the other hand the coughing may not have been an allergic reaction but something close to choking due to not chewing the food properly. If he has any reason to doubt, have him see a physician (allergist) who can properly test him for this allergy.|`|yrBqpVsBaa	Allergies can spring up at any point in your life.

zLUQJxJkaa	More reps with less weight tones your arms, makes them have better endurance, harder and overall looks like muscles that are hard.<br>  Fewer reps with more weight makes arms bigger, less distinct muscle, and overall a little stronger. Toning is better IMO because it won't "deflate" like building will. You can tone your muscles and they'll look the same for weeks, but building will go down in a few days.
AA10717341	You have two basic types of muscle:<br>  <br>  Fast twitch and slow twitch.  As you indicated 10 x 5kg would build endurance, and also impacts primarily fast twitch muscles.  This also contributes to near instantaneous visible muscle, in that it also affects more of the muscles that are directly beneath the skin surface.<br>  <br>  5 x 10kg curls is better for building strength.  Heavier weights most directly challenge slow twitch, deep muscles.  Using heavier weights with fewer reps will also have a more direct impact on your metabolism -- increasing your resting/sleeping metabolism by up to 5%.  While these muscles will not give you the superficial pop, they are what show as long-lean, heavy muscle.<br>  <br>  As with any exercise, changing-up weight, reps and particular motion (bicep curls to concentration bicep curls for example) will have the most dramatic impact on your body composition, and also create the most healthy, well-balanced body.|`|woK6mApGaa	you answered your own question. lifting less but with more reps helps you build endurance. while curling more weight with less reps makes you gain muscle.|`|kG2c19r3aa	Doing more reps with less weight builds endurance and durability.  Less reps with more weight activate muscle fibers which send nerve signals to your body and build more muscle definition.|`|3vaQfqNMaa	more reps and less weight adds muscle tone and less reps with more weight builds strength

mAQHyfCYaa	Pros: it can be regulated. There can be standards, such as mandatory condom use, STI checks, etc. No violence towards the prostitutes by the customers or the pimps. No under-aged prostitution, no "crack whores" or prostitutes os addicted to a drug that they do whatever their pimp tells them to get their fix. For the people who use prostitutes they would no longer need to worry about being caught because it would be legal.<br>  <br>  Cons: I guess people that use prostitutes might miss the thrill of doing something illegal. <br>  <br>  And truthfully I support legalizing prostitution because of the above reasons so I can't think of many cons, I am sure there are many religious, moral and ethical reasons why it is wrong but I really don't care.|`|vKCS3AVLaa	pros- more people happy<br>  cons- more people with aids|`|J1J47FIAaa	As long as they get checked before they have sex.|`|dpmDLhNSaa	of prostitutes  <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>  ARGUMENTS FOR: <br>  <br>  <br>   There have always been prostitutes, and there always will be. To pretend otherwise is humbug and hypocrisy. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   Current laws are confused and illogical. Prostitution itself is not illegal, though soliciting in a public place is. Advertising sexual services is not illegal, if done in coded language. Making use of prostitutes is legal, though living off their earnings is not. The confusion puts prostitutes on the borderline of criminality. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   The Ipswich murders show how dangerous a prostitute's life can be. Licensing would allow prostitutes to work in legal brothels, a more secure environment. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   Licensed prostitutes could be required to submit to regular medical examinations; reducing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. <br>  <br>  <br>   Sex is a commodity offered for sale. The sale of other goods is regulated. The sale of sex should be no different.<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>     <br>   <br>  The First Post guide to the issue of the day <br>   <br>   <br>    ARGUMENTS AGAINST:<br>  <br>  <br>   Prostitution is immoral and degrading to women. No decent society should give it the stamp of public approval by licensing those who practise it. <br>  <br>  <br>   Far from relaxing the law, it should be made more severe. Decent citizens should not have to tolerate the existence of 'red-light districts' to which police turn a blind eye. <br>  <br>  <br>   The way to curb prostitution is to make it a criminal offence to buy sex.<br>  <br>  <br>   It is foolish to suppose that licensing prostitutes would prevent other women - drug addicts for instance - from working as unlicensed prostitutes. A licensed prostitute who failed a medical examination would likely return to the street. So licensing prostitutes would not solve the problem. <br>  <br>  <br>   Sex should not be regarded as a commodity, divorced from love. Licensing prostitution makes the statement that society approves of that divide.<br>  <br>  FIRST POSTED DECEMBER 13, 2006 <br>  Related links|`|TTt51jutaa	There are no pros to legalizing prostitution, sweetie.

0hHw5IK7aa	Try not to take on too much:<br>  <br>  When I was at school I decided to take on higher level math. I was rubbish at it but I kept pushing myself..trying to keep up with everyone else as i didnt want to drop out. I was always stressed, panicking about homework and missing out on spending time with my friends, I starting feeling miserable, lost my confidence in everything.<br>  <br>  My mum new a professor that taught maths at a university and she told me to go speak to him.

Some people bruise more easily than others, and this is indicative of fragile capillaries, poor health or an inability to create collagen. For people who bruise easily, bruises seem to appear for no apparent reason. Research has shown us that the leading cause of frequent bruising is a deficiency in one or more nutrients. The elderly, due to their generally poor diet, are quite susceptible to having bruises. The remedy is very simple: add supplements to your diet. Dieters who have lost a substantial amount of weight are also at risk of developing bruises. This is due to the fact that they have many capillaries that were needed to supply blood to their body, but that body is no longer there, leaving the capillaries exposed.<br>  <br>  One of the main causes of bruising seems to be a deficiency in certain nutrients, primarily vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin K, bioflavonoids, and zinc. A vitamin C deficiency may be caused by several factors:<br>  <br>  ? eating too few fruits and vegetables (remember the problem sailors used to have centuries ago with scurvy outbreaks on long voyages? It was caused by a lack of vitamin C)<br>  ? taking drugs which destroys this vitamin <br>  ? long-time stress from illness, frustration or depression<br>  ? smoking (one cigarette can deplete the body of 25 mg of vitamin C) <br>  ? frequent emotional outbursts such as anger<br>  ? exposure to pollutants, allergens or heavy metals <br>  <br>  A deficiency in hesperidin, one of the bioflavonoids (sometimes called vitamin P), naturally occurring nutrients usually found in association with vitamin C, has been linked with abnormal capillary weakness. These bioflavonoids, including hesperidin, Citrin, Rutin, Flavones, Flavonals, Calechin and Quercetin, were found to be essential in correcting the tendency toward bruising.<br>  <br>  Tips<br>  When you bump something, immediately apply a cold compress to the area to reduce the swelling.|`|jZguzD2Raa	Ooh sorry that was me.

Start a program at Curves, or a local fitness center, or join some sort of sports team. <br>  <br>  My suggestion:<br>  <br>  Breakfast: glass of orange juice, PLAIN yogurt with weat germ, and fruit (add some honey or maple syrup to sweeten it). If you want something hot, cook up an egg, but DON'T use butter, use olive oil. <br>  <br>  Lunch: Sandwich with whole grain bread. Avocado, spinnach, tomato, olive oil (no mayonase or spreads because they have bad fats and colories)...<br>  <br>  Snack: Handful of almonds is great!! Also, drink a lot of water! <br>  <br>  Dinner: Veggie burgers are good, but you should definitely check the brand/calorie count because some veggie burgers are loaded with trans fats and sugar. Morning Star is my favorite brand for veggie products. <br>  <br>  Eat a lot of raw vegetables and fruits. Don't eat the same three fruits, and veggies. <br>  <br>  I still think lots of exercise is the best. Create a simple work out plan, and follow through every day for 3 weeks. Be consistant. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|85KrSJh3aa	Most diets these days will actually cause you to gain MORE weight in the long run.<br>  <br>  I suggest you use a natural system to help you lose the weight you want.

rDb9ZLyfaa	I had all four of mine out at the same time.. I think I was 16 and it was not horrible at all.  They give you meds ...the hardest part is keeping the sockets clean and eating and drinking.  I think I was fine in 3 days :)  Don't sweat it... I was completely out when they did it though|`|rFlhIgJXaa	Depends, one of my brothers was put to sleep for it, the other one had no freezing and the dentist just knocked em out, apparently getting fillings hurt more for him(he went for fillings and the dentist said why dont i knock those wisdom teeth out for you and he did, took a big chisel thing and tapped em out). Of course if you are going for a specialist i assume theres some sort of impact thing going on (growing in sideways or somesuch) and you probably will have to have surgery. The sooner you go the better off you are.<br>  <br>  The brother that was put to sleep had a bunch of awesome pain meds that probably cause hallucinations and was unable to do anything for a week. The other brother went to work right afterwards and was fine, just a little swollen, they did not administer novocaine to him because it does not actually freeze him very well, they give him the max dosage and he still feels so they dont give him any anymore :).<br>  <br>  I have yet to get mine taken out :/... It all depends on the person...|`|xr2Tf9egaa	I think everyone gets panicked at the thought of wisdom teeth extraction.  I know I did.  But, let me tell you, not only did it not hurt at all, the medicine they gave me to relax me and deaden the pain was WONDERFUL.  I've often told people that I never felt better than when I had my wisdom teeth out.  The worst of all is the bleeding afterward, because who likes blood anyway.  You may not even bleed too much.  Your doctor will give you pain meds to take at home and you will do great.  As far as the pain scale, I never had any more than 5, and that's pushing it.  Within a couple of days, I barely knew I had surgery at all.  Nobody can take away all your fear, and all people are different when it comes to medical procedures.  I wish you a good experience and a very speedy recovery.|`|VULcEH21aa	I just had my wisdom teeth out two days ago actually. On a scale of 1-10.. maybe a 3. I looked like a chipmunk when i got out of surgery, and was pretty groggy/ goofy lol, and was a bit swollen and numb. Now the numbness wore off and I have been on vicodin to ease pain. Just keep the ice pack on, and stay on the pain meds. The first day all you can have to eat is some kind of smoothie, or a milkshake. Then the 2nd day you can eat soup and apple sauce type stuff. Just take the vicodin (or whatever pain meds) and amoxicillan, keep your pain area iced, and just take it easy and you will be fine. My doc said like 5 days and you are good to go. Hope that helps!|`|ERnZPKTlaa	I got all 4 of mine out, and I had hydrocodone. It's not bad, unless you get dry socket (i clenched my teeth at night because i had another surgery on my shoulder a week later, and i did everything i was supposed to!) Make sure you rinse with the salt water and have lots of soft foods. you'll be fine! :)<br>  <br>  My recovery time was like 5 days. not a biggie.|`|kFC4ug3baa	I was really worried about it, but it wasn't that bad.  It obviously will be different for everybody.  I would say a 2.  Don't listen to all the people saying how terrible it was because that will just psyche you out.  I actually thought it was fun in a wierd way because I got to lay around for a whole weekend watching movies and eating icecream and soup.|`|bNAHAGvHaa	Depends how many wisdom teeth you have. I had 4 taken out. It is basically surgery, so you will most likely be put under. You just wake up with cotton swabs all over your mouth. They always give you pain killers to help cope with the pain.<br>  <br>  Recovery is over a week at least.|`|oatNCFjyaa	I think the most painful part is when they stick in the needle to numb your mouth so it's probably about the same as when you get regular teeth pulled out.  I'm not really sure though because I don't think I've ever gotten my wisdom teeth pulled out.|`|N7NdDtpHaa	You'd be so knocked out or hyped on the laughing gas. That you won't be able too notice but after that wears off it's hella painful I rank it as a 7.|`|CHCPnvksaa	When I had my top widsom teeth taken out, it wasn't bad at all, the worst part of the procedure was the needle. I was prescribed pain meds and didn't bother taking them. i just ate soft foods for about 3 days. <br>  When I had the bottom ones out, that was a different story. I had to get knocked out for that because the teeth were growing in instead of up so he had to cut open my gum and break the teeth and pull them out in pieces. I was on pain meds for a few days. If you smoke, don't smoke after getting them out. I ended up with an infection because I continued to smoke.|`|mqMhrmloaa	7. take painkillers when you don't need to. take them more than you're supposed to, but not like 20 a day. That's dangerous. Your body is gonna feel like ****, but as long as you don't feel the pain in your mouth, you're gonna be fine. I had mine out with the laughing gas - ask for the laughing gas! It's so much better on the way out! <br>  <br>  Recovery... eh... by the time the month is over you should be back to normal, but still be sensitive to touching anything back there. Whatever you do - TAKE THE PAINKILLERS.|`|qWIha03Iaa	I had all four of mine out in October, and personally it was horrible (9.9). And I'm not trying to scare you by any means, I just think you want the truth. <br>  <br>  However, I cannot swallow pills so I was in constant pain as soon as the freezing came out. Also, I unfortunately had an infection and two dry sockets, which made it that much worse. I was literally in tears for a week until I went to see the dentist. I can't quite remember approx. how long it took to heal, since it is different for everyone and I had some issues. But I would say over two or three weeks, maybe even a month. It's February and they are almost fully closed. Haha<br>  <br>  Your experience could be totally different then mine though. If you can take pills then you should be absolutely fine pain wise, just make sure you keep taking them as instructed :). Eating is going to suck for the first week and it's a true pain in the a** to clean out the wholes after that. But, it's better to get them out now rather than having them cause you problems in the future, ex. pain and infections. <br>  <br>  But yea, they put you to sleep for it so you wont feel or remember a thing. I was truly frightened by that part, which seems silly now. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you and I hope you have a better experience than myself.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Dont ask ok, just get done what needs to be done. If you can go under completely, do so, the anestesia for me anyhow, seemed to stay in my system a long time and helped with pain. I took alieve for pain, 4 tablets every 12 hours, no aspirin based med in system for 12 hours before or 24 horus after, take the drs prescription for a few days, and then start on alieve with a pharmasists approval after you tell him all meds you are on for other health issues only, get that approval. Make sure you follow the ice packs and then heat applications as noted in the post op instructions, that is really key in keeping pain to its least it can be, keeping swelling down is key. Eat only the foods they tell you to, its tough, I poured soup or oatmeal down my throat to help keep my mouth clean and nothing getting stuck in the stitches, took alot of work. Since everyones pain leve is so so different, Ive known people who would answer your question on a 3, and them some people ..........|`|5afa5bd19226d3326c9f6bc410b563e1aa	I only had 1 removed top right.  The worst part was the shot of Novocain directly in the top of the mouth.  It is sore after wards because you have an open sore, but I don't think its that big a deal.  I would do it again if I need to.|`|s9zC9r9Uaa	for me it was about a five. My face didn't even swell up. The reason it was half way was cause I didn't have any pain from the operation but the pain medicine made me throw up. I was able to go out 3 days after I got them out|`|Ax9UJMiLaa	its not pain its is uncomfortable, you really dont feel because of the anestesia, well thats how it was for me it also depends on the dentist or specialist doing it, my dentist was very smooth, they also give you pain med if you get any pain, but na you dont really need it. number #1 thing be very relaxed and dont worry it hurts more when you are tense. <br>  good luck *:o)|`|5c07eea93e2b7eb3dfa4e16ee3a3c43eaa	It depends on the individual and whether or not the teeth are impacted.  My sister was in bad shape after hers were removed, and she was eating soft food and in pain for about 5 days.<br>  <br>  When I got mine out I felt virtually no pain, I just took a couple tylenol, and I even ate normal food the same day.<br>  <br>  The dentist will likely prescribe you plenty of pain meds just to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  Hopefully it will be easy on you like it was for me.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ClZWgDoxaa	I know someone who just got them out.. It was an 11 he said.. It felt like someone was ripping all your nerves and squeezing them he said. Idk, does't sound like fun at all the way he described it.. Even with the Novacaine it hurt like heck he said. It's been a week since he got it doen and still can't open his mouth all the way and chew on that side.|`|aWbMhQvVaa	Well it depends on how the dentist is taking them out. Are they cutting them out or are they pulling them? Pulling is the least painful one and cutting is bad so I hear. I don't mean to scare you but pulling is about a 3. And cutting is about a 7 i guess.My brother took about a week to recover. You'll be just fine. Best of wishes. God bless you.:D|`|hUHwf0hmaa	For me, it was like a 6.<br>  <br>  I had all 4 out at the same time.  i quit smoking during the recovery.|`|z6DIHEG3aa	it's actually amazing cause you get vikoden.|`|Aq77sFxYaa	eww i never ha had it but my mom has and she says its pretty bad so like a 8|`|6yD5k9Azaa	nine
UOZP4Ma5aa	You can only do an implant after 18 year sof age if its done now, your other teeth will grow longer than the implant
kjW1fmmPaa	That is up to you and your counselor to decide.  Don't feel guilty at all! And you are most definitely not a "waste of space".  You are a strong person trying to heal.  <br>  <br>  I know this may sound rude, but disregard what your mother says about the counselling process.  She is not a counselor (I assume), and I assume she is not in the room when you are talking with your counselor.  It is easy to think that once someone has gone to a few sessions and is starting to feel better that they are "cured", but often people really just need that continuing support and reinforcement from the counselor.  Yes, you probably know of some coping tips by now but if you quit counselling too early and your anxiety begins to return, when you are in distress it is hard to think logically and thus you may not be able to use those coping mechanisms properly.<br>  <br>  The fact that you are not confident about ending your counseling sessions and the fact that you have only been feeling better for a few days are indications to me  that you are not ready to quit it yet.  But again, you need to talk with your counselor next time you go and work together to figure out when you can start having sessions further and further apart, and then eventually stop going.  Don't let your family's perceptions of your progress sway you, only you and your counselor know for sure how well you are doing and will continue to do.<br>  <br>  One more side note, it's normal to feel incomplete, as these past behaviours were almost a part of who you were, and now that the behaviours and feelings are being eliminated, you are being forced to forge a new identity and not be able to rely on what you know.  With time it should get easier, just keep reminding yourself that you are getting better but you can take your time with the counseling.  And seek out support wherever you can, maybe even talk calmly with your mom and tell her that you will end the counseling when you feel ready, but in the meantime would appreciate her not pressuring you to quit it because you wouldn't want to risk relapsing.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|SkDomhoXaa	no DON'T stop!!!!<br>  <br>  i'm not lucky enough to be able to have cbt in my area yet, but i do feel the same with my medication - i have a few good days and want to stop taking it. which is a bad idea.<br>  <br>  i have started learning cbt out of a book lol (the dummies guide to cbt)<br>  i just wish i had someone who could help me and guide me thought it. <br>  however you must not stop the therapy until you are advised to do so.<br>  <br>  my friend has been with his therapist for nearly 2years and although he "seems" ok most of the time there is still moments where he slips.<br>  so i urge you to carry on with it, you not a waste of space, you deserve the help and are lucky enough to be given a chance, so grab it with both hands.

Let them know what's bothering you, or that you simply need to relax. If your nervous during the massage try to empty your mind and focus on the relaxing music. If that doesn't work chat with your therapist. Your Therapist will ask you to be UNDER the sheet/blanket either face up or face down. You'll undress to your level of comfort, most people are either fully nude, or leave the boxers/panties on. You breasts/genitalia will always be covered by the drape. Relax, and enjoy your massage!|`|3Q1ofzZPaa	you will take off your own clothes in a private room and be given a robe.<br>  <br>  you will be in a room under some blankets while you get the massage, they will not see any of your private parts, they will simply lift back the parts of the blanket that they want to massage, but never exposing something. <br>  <br>  you will love it, it is so relaxing, and will relieve some stress!

Just like nonprescription glasses, they won't alter your vision at all.<br>  <br>  Word of advice, though, start wearing them at least a month before Halloween so that your eyes can get used to them.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'd recommend just getting prescription ones. They're more expensive, but it's so nice to NOT have to wear glasses!|`|txeWi8Bbaa	Hi there, <br>  <br>  Before purchasing colored contacts, I would recommend visiting your optometrist. Contacts that are sold for $20 over the counter can be VERY dangerous to your vision because they are not sized and fit properly to your pupil and can scratch your eyes and not allow for proper vision (generally tunnel vision is created). I certainly understand that many people purchase these lenses, and believe it or not, I did once as well. I found that they were uncomfortable, difficult to wear for any extended period of time, and left me with blurry vision for hours after. I then visited the eye doctor, he was able to fit a pair for me, they are comfortable and easy to wear and I have had no issues. Now please keep in mind that I do not require glasses at all, they were purely aesthetic but the extra few dollars at the doctor was worth every penny. They can also put your prescription right in the colored lenses to solve your wearing glasses problem. Cost is anywhere from $40 to $80. It is an avenue that I would recommend at least checking out before purchasing the $20 pair. <br>  <br>  Best Wishes, <br>  <br>  -Ethan|`|Bii5FvqLaa	I highly recommend seeing an optometrist. They will be able to give you a prescription and show you how contacts are inserted and removed. Otherwise, you risk infecting or damaging your eyes.

Good luck!|`|QK4r41Hqaa	you could allways get the contacts with no vision alteration.<br>  <br>  Then you could wear the glasses, and the contacts wouldn't affect anything other then your eye color (but, you have to have your eyedoctor's permission, signature, all that crap in orderto get them- or last time I tried to that happened....)|`|AA10065759	To get any type of contacts for your eyes,<br>  you have to see an eye doctor.<br>  <br>  It is for your safety, the eye doctor will make sure<br>  it will fit properly and won't cause you problems.<br>  <br>  WARNING!!!!<br>  DO NOT buy any "used ones" or order any off the<br>  internet.<br>  Unless you want SERIOUS EYE PROBLEMS or<br>  to go blind.<br>  Again, only an eye doctor can make this determination.<br>  <br>  = = = = =  = = = = = = = = = = = =
ZuYTZ80Gaa	The gynecologic exam involves three steps.<br>  <br>  1) The doctor examines the outer genitalia for any abnormalities<br>  <br>  2) The doctor inserts a speculum (a device to open the vagina, kind of looks like a ducks bills) into the vagina with some gentle pressure.  They open the speculum and take a look to the back of the vagina to the cervix.  They may choose at this point to do some swabs from the area and/or a pap smear, which involves a little scraping of tissue.<br>  <br>  3) The doctor then takes the speculum out, and performs a bimanual exam.  This involves inserting one finger into the vagina and one hand on the abdomen outside, the doctor tries to get the uterus/ovaries between both hands to feel the consistency.<br>  <br>  The exam takes 3-5 minutes.

Don't believe people if they say that they can't be.<br>  <br>  Both your sleep and menstrual cycle are regulated by hormones. If something is messing with your hormones then it can cause your irregular period and sleep pattern. Also, someone mentioned that having to pee a lot can be a sign of diabetes. It can be, it can also be a result of irregular blood sugar levels, which can also be serious but not a disease like diabetes. But again insulin is a hormone that controls blood sugar levels. And also there is a hormone that controls how much water is reabsored by the body, if this hormone isn't at the proper levels either then the body doesn't reabsorb that water so you have to urinate a lot.<br>  <br>  It could also be stress induced insomnia. Stress will mess with your period and your sleeping habits.<br>  <br>  In any case you should go see a doctor and tell him/her what's going on. If it is a hormonal issue it's best to catch it early, hormones control a lot of things in your body so if they aren't working right then it could cause a lot more problems in the future.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|qAHAb5RRaa	Find a quiet comfortable room. NO DISTRACTIONS! If you must remove T.V, Cell Phone, Clock, etc. then do so. Make it very dark in there. Lay down, and even if you don't feel tired just lay there with your eyes closed. All of these problems could very well, and most likely are, because of your sleep schedule. It is SO unhealthy. It affects your period, weight, eyesight, mental health, weakens your immunee system. <br>  BAD!<br>   Lay there until you find sleep. Do this until it becomes habit and easy. The first couple nights will be hard but you have to stay strong.<br>   If this continues, however, speak to your doctor. It could be insomnia or any other range of diseases.

YDeYXjpwaa	I too have fibromyalgia.  I was diagnosed at the age of 34 and was told that was young for the typical age to develop it.  My mom also has it and i now have a niece that developed it in her mid-twenties.  There are various degrees that it can affect individuals.  i myself have several other medical issues and therefore went out on full disability shortly after being diagnosed.  At this time i work part time as a secretary, I have to switch often from task to task because doing anything repetitive with my hands for to long causes severe aching.  This said I do know of other individuals with fibromyalgia that through physical therapy and medications are very successfully continuing to work regular full-time jobs.  So don't be discouraged, aim for your dreams....it may be that you have to alter the way you do things but if it's what you really want don't give up without trying!  have you contacted someone that works in the field, like your friend's dad.  Maybe he knows of a type of job in that field that you would be able to handle.  Good luck with your dream.  And just remember with a disease like fibromyalgia...you will have good days and bad so make the most of the good ones!|`|h6cAhPs6aa	yes i think you would have a hard time. fibromyalgia really hurts.  because i have it myself.  but the is medication to help with the pain. even sitting at a desk hurts the minute you get up from your desk.  but i also believe if you want to do something bad enough you can do it.  especially if your young.  give it a try  you will no what you can or cannot do.   i wish you luck hon|`|Gk4kNAWsaa	my mom has fibromyalgia and i am so sorry to hear that a 16 year old has to suffer from that as well. when you hear about the disease, you generally think of older people and it makes me sad to realize this disease has no boundaries. sorry. i think you still could have a career in ecology, but talk to your school councilor for options and take a minor that would benefit both the ecology side and what you're going through physically.

Ba5PVgHMaa	Breaking up is hard. But dont ever think a girl has control to rule your emotions to that kind of extent. You arent living for her. Your living for you, or if your religious, your life is not yours its Gods. <br>  There is never a valid reason to why someone should kill themselves, that shouldnt even be an option. Theres always people who care about you, whether you think that or not. <br>  Theres always another way. It does take time, but i promise you over time, it will get better. It may take months, it may take years, but it will get better, and when it does you'll be glad you didnt let this breakup control you.<br>  Life gets hard, everyone goes through it, you just got to hold on and tough through it. If you have a close friend or a parent whom you could trust, i would go to them and talk to them and they can give you the encouragement you need. <br>  <br>  Hold on, it'll get better.<br>  <br>  <3 Crystal.|`|u4LLFhORaa	try prayer if ur a christian.God works in strange ways. ask for his help|`|yCU47Zskaa	I hope you're being serious because if you're not you have a sick sense of humor.

This would definitely be a red flag for me.  If he is that aggressive with kissing, how will he react the first time he wants sex and you aren't ready?

Maybe he's just craving attention and doesn't know he's creeping you out, or maybe he's a phycopathic reincarnation of jack the ripper, it's hard to tell.<br>  <br>  Just let him know he's suffocating you/creeping you out/ coming on too strong, and see how he reacts. If he gets angry, gtfo, if he just made a mistake, see if he improves.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you honey.|`|nFpOWZy5aa	I think he likes you a whole lot more than you like him.  You are being selfish by staying with him.  You obviously can't stand him, and there are girls out there who would love a guy like that.|`|IdwbQTIaaa	Maybe you feel this way because you feel he is moving too fast and is going to want to do things your not ready to do?  Or because you feel he is acting needy?  I just started dating a new guy too, and he is constantly wanting to kiss me, hold my hand, put his arm around me and I like my space!  Just tell him your not comfortable being attatched to him at all moments your hanging out.  If he understands, keep him around.  If he gets mad that you dont wanna kiss him constantly, ditch him.  Cause if he's that obsessed with kissing you, he might be worse with other things!  Good Luck!!
Rk46lIBwaa	This is quite an important question, and though he was jesting the question, 'where is the other one' is quite important. It is probably there somewhere as an undescended testicle and it is often considered wise to look into this and either bring the second testicle down in to the scrotum, or to remove it.<br>  <br>  If removal is the better option in your case then a realistic prosthetic testicle can be implanted in the scrotum to make things look and feel normal.<br>  <br>  BTW a single testicle will allow you to father children in the normal way.<br>  <br>  Ask your GP to refer you to a urologist.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Has this been seen by a doctor?

One testicle is enough to do the job. When you eventually get with a girl, she is going to figure it out.|`|OsnCPSsoaa	It may have something to do with it because you were born 3 months early.  During medical physicals doctors usually check your testicles for lumps.  If something was wrong they would have probably brought attention to it.  I think you only NEED one.

Next time during your physical maybe you can talk to your doctor about it.|`|AA10350894	You have what is known as an Undescended Testicle, If you go and see your doctor they can patch you up so it lowers down to where it should be.|`|LCMCrmQTaa	What happened to the other one????|`|zEy0uuAFaa	You can get through life fine with one testicle.  It will just have to work a little harder than if you had two.  Perhaps one of your testicles didn't descend properly when you were younger.  Your pediatrician should have noticed this and corrected it, or maybe it was removed when you were a baby because of some defect.<br>  <br>  Ask your parents about this.  If they know why you're missing one, they may just be embarrassed and not sure how to bring up the subject.  If it's news to them, ask to see the doctor so you can correct an undescended testicle if possible.|`|luCReaXcaa	Please don't get paranoid or depressed over the matter.  It just isn't worth it.  I went through similar circumstances as you are now.  It is very possible the second one is up inside your body.

You could also have had one removed as an infant for some reason. If that is the case your parents could answer that. You can still get a girl pregnant with only one testicle, you just have less storage space for semen. As for the girls they may consider this a novelty that could become popular with them. THey may just want to look or even more. I would use it as a selling point with girls. Use condoms you do not need any other problems.|`|d21532a2f9f71c66253d32b4a34837d0aa	Serious problem yes - well maybe.<br>  <br>  Likely hood is that you have 2 testicles, but only one has decended.  If this is the case you'll need to get it looked at ASAP.<br>  <br>  I've two decended testicles, but one is about a quarter the size of the other and often 'vanishes', only to re-appear later.

Stay away from energy drinks and caffeine because things like that will actually cause your body to slow down and it starves your muscles. when you go to the gym concentrate on your legs, but, tummy and back this will help with endurance and speed.
ZuYTZ80Gaa	Unless there is a specific indication (such as working in a profession where bodily fluids could be exchanged, such as professional sports) There is absolutely no reason to idenitify HIV patients.  The reason being is that there is no risk of contracting HIV without the exchange of semen or blood.  In fact people with mono, chicken pox, colds, pneumonia, or diarrheal illnesses are much more infectious and aren't isolated from society.    <br>  <br>  Identification of HIV patients simply draws out stereotypes and isolates this population.  The HIV patient of today is actually quite healthy and could not usually be picked out easily, since medications are more and more effective.|`|hc89tLJcaa	There is no need for that.

sNE6qwAOaa	I'll be completely honest with you, Differin saved my life.  I don't get a lot of pimples, but I got one large, noticeable one every couple days.  I struggled with it especially in the winter for probably 3 years from 8th grade to 11th, and that's when I finally decided to see a dermatologist. <br>  <br>  I now have really clear skin, and it's amazing how much better clear skin can make you feel.  A fresh breakout can definitely ruin your day haha.  <br>  <br>  Anyways I know you don't have too bad of acne, so you might want to just try a regular cleanser like Cetaphil (it's a good one). But if you want to definitely eliminate it, set up an appointment with a dermatologist.  You need a prescription for Differin, so you need to see the doctor.  It does cost a little more than the average acne cream, but it's definitely worth it.  It also lasts a long time, so it's a good deal.  I hope something works for you :)|`|YwHl37Hgaa	If you have an oily skin wash your face twice a day in warm salty water. This should leave your face oil free without aggravating the pimples like soap.The secret of keeping the skin clear is to keep it oil-free and clean.

If you have a combination skin when you wash your face, use sugar to scrub it, at least once a day, for two weeks to rid yourself of acne.Try  <a href="http://solutionsforpimples.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://solutionsforpimples.blogspot.com/</a> for more info.|`|htpxHZTPaa	Lol i don't feel like posting a pic of myself but.<br>  I use clean and clear acne free<br>  My sister uses Noxzema <br>  <br>  Pick one.

It's getting rid of stress.  When you get stressed your body releases extra chemicals (mainly adrenalin), tenses your muscles, secretes different oils, causes your digestion to react differently.. the list is endless.<br>  <br>  I'm actually a therapist and I've seen so many things (including acne) cured by EFT simply from reducing stress. Also EFT balances the nervous system which could be malfunctioning if you are getting pimples. if you go to the official EFT website you can download a manual on how to do EFT yourself completely free - so try it, and if you need help contact me. You can also go to the resources section and view case studies on EFT for acne and see how it helped others. www.emofree.com<br>  <br>  Heres my site too - extra info and some videos of EFT so you know what your doing.<br>  <br>  Good luck, let me know how you get on<br>  <br>  Kelly|`|jZguzD2Raa	Well, after I shaved every part of my body completely bald even though I'm a girl, I was acne free!

8HmULotpaa	There are three main symptoms.  they are 1. Attention deficit, 2. Hyperactivity and 3. Poor impulse control.<br>  <br>  To understand these better.<br>  <br>  1. Attention deficit - Trouble concentrating on things like school work, short attention span, gets bored and looses interest in things really quickly and easily, easily distracted, underachieving at school, trouble finishing your work in time, trouble concentrating on things you enjoy like watching TV.<br>  <br>  2. hyperactivity - fidgetting and fiddeling constantly, talking a lot, needs hardly any sleep, cant sit still or stay seated, trouble walking places tends to run and jump and skip and hop instead, often very loud, always feeling restless, often feels driven by a motor like you cant stop.<br>  <br>  3. Poor impulse control - struggles to think of the consequences of your actions, acts without thinking, gets in trouble a lot, gets in serious trouble like being suspended or excluded from school, repeats behaviour often already corrected, just tends to do silly things all the time.<br>  <br>  There are also three other things you must have in order to have ADHD.<br>  <br>  1. You must have had these problems your whole life, ADHD does not appear later on in life.  It is an inborn condition, you have to have had it your whole life.<br>  <br>  2. The problems must be in all parts of your life not just school.  You would need to have these problems at school, at home, when watching TV, when playing sport, when out with friends, and everywhere.<br>  <br>  3. These problems must be very severe and have caused major problems in your life.|`|XKYP0sGQaa	How old are you ? I am sure that if you had ADHD the signs would have been picked up on by now.

Start going slow if you want to tone up, and eat healthy|`|kyVP0kC7aa	Dont eat bagel in the morning and for a teenager to  lose weight is fairly qucike than someone older and eat a lot less and exersice a lot more and do a lot of running|`|HK30PzNraa	Skipping lunch is the only big no no I see.I have lost between 12-14 pounds just by staying under 1700 calories a day.Hope you start losing!!|`|YoSgEUstaa	what you should do is eat most in the morning, snack throughout the whole day on foods like fruit/granola bars/cereal/etc. i used to keep a baggy of cereal in my purse to munch on. Your smallest meal should be dinner. this is because you burn the most calories and use the most energy throughout the day, so eat a big breakfast, but a small dinner. gradually make your meals smaller throughout the day.  It actually helps to eat MORE when you exercise because your metabolism goes up burning more calories and keeping you healthier!<br>  <br>  also, depends on how much you want to lose. I lost 128 lbs in 16 months. It's typically healthy to lose 1 pound per week but that has to be paired with healthy eating and exercise.|`|jN83NgfTaa	Try this diet:<br>  eat 5 smalls meals a day. Not eating anything all day long makes you gain weight and its not healthy. Try not to eat repeated food, try new foods everyday. Try eating healthier like a lot of nuts, fruits, vegetables, water instead of sodas, cottage cheese, yogurt, smoothies, etc...Try to cut all as much junk food as you can, eat it every once in a while. Eat dinner before 7:30 p.m and don't anything for the rest of the night. <br>  Exercise:<br>  continue doing what your doing right now. maybe try to switch it out a little like run 2-3 times a week, crunches, push-ups, lifting. Cardio is a big thing if you want to lose Weight. Lifting will help you tone your muscles.|`|W0ZsuxRTaa	it sounds pretty good. just know that snacking throughout the day instead of 3 big meals might work out better for you.  <br>  also, just because eating salad sounds healthy, it doesn't mean that you can't gain weight from eating salads.  make sure that you measure out proportions before eating any meal and that you're not adding a lot of extra stuff like loads of dressing.<br>  my third suggestion has to do with the exercise portion.  i would say definitely stick to cardio because then you're sweating things out, but maybe no too much pilates.  with pilates, you'll be gaining muscle and that tends to make people look bigger since all that muscle will be building under the fat and will add to it.  and DEFINITELY stretch. you don't want to hurt yourself. maybe just a light stretch beforehand then go all out afterwards.<br>  good luck! i truly admire what you're doing.|`|ZIyZRGftaa	In order to lose weight your going to want to eat something like fruit or yogurt in the morning, NEVER SKIP BREAKFAST it will boost your metabolism! they suggest eating 6 small meals a day, it will keep you full. For example have a bag of nuts or fruit, string cheese.  Stay away from a lot of carbohydrates, drink 8 glasses a day. Weight watchers is a really really good program if you have an extra 20 dollars to join.  And for dinner eat a smaller meal. Your exercise looks good, doing a lot of cardio will help! also working out in the morning is better for you, it iwll also boost your metabolism!|`|Yi4ja5Lkaa	with all that excersize girl, you better be putting a bit more in your tummy.<br>  if your losing toomuch too quick,and not eating enough - everything you do eat your body will store, cos your body thinks its going to need it to keep going. maybe an extra salad or something. good luck :)|`|2nOC6OZHaa	You'll need lots of veggies and fruits. You need a lunch. You'll need to work out also.|`|Nytn8HB8aa	Your exercise certainly sounds great, as long as you're not doing it every day. That would be a good way to tire yourself out quick. Every other day, or maybe three days a week would be fine. Also, you might want to turn that "maybe" stretching afterwards into *always* stretching afterwards. Stretching is a great cool down, and who doesn't like flexibility?<br>  <br>  Your eating concerns me, though, but only because of how much you aren't consuming. <br>  <br>  Yes, the key to losing weight is to burn more calories than you consume, but that doesn't mean you need to starve yourself! A bagel for breakfast is fine. Maybe add a piece of fruit or a cup of yogurt to that. Lunch is important. You should always eat a midday meal. Dinner sounds good. Protein is healthy! I hope you're getting some veggies in with that met, too!<br>  The no snack thing is a pretty bad idea. Snacks help you by giving you little energy boosts during the day and keeping your appetite satisfied. Things like apples (any fruit, really) or raw nuts (mmm, almonds!) are good to keep on hand for snacks (or you could just google it). <br>  <br>  Water is also really important, and you didn't mention it. Cut. Out. Any. Soda. <br>  <br>  It might be hard at first, but sodas are absolute diet killers! Empty calories! Your body is at least half water! And if "plain" water doesn't strike your fancy, get flavored water. It's just as good. <br>  <br>  :) Good luck!|`|zZVHdfD4aa	Hop hop abs? Pilates?<br>  <br>  You need to build muscle. Take a weght training class and cut out the yuppie crap. You're literally just stretching and doing some crunches and it won't do anything. Pilates are for people that are already fit, which you are not according to your post.<br>  <br>  My sister used to do all of the pilates junk and home video prane in front of the tube things. They never worked, she still does them and is a friggin cow! We're talking about 300 punds on a 5 foot 6 inch frame. FAT. <br>  <br>  You want to really drop some pounds? <br>  <br>  - Go to GNC and get a high protein meal replacement shake. Replace 2 meals a day with it. Don't buy any fat burners or pills - those things do not work and stress your heart. Don't buy any of the opther crap they will peddle at you. Expect to spend $60.<br>  <br>  - Start a weight training regiment. I'm not talking sissy pink colored weights you've seen used in your videos. GO TO A GYM. Get a friend to join you if you need someone to push you along. Creates competition, helps motivation. <br>  <br>  - Get a personal training session. 24 hour fitness offers something like 3 sessions free. They give you valuable advice and a workout plan to run with. Don't be bashful about it. If you think your *** to fat - SAY SO. They'll point you in the right direction. Make sure resistance training is incorporated. <br>  <br>  - Go to the gym EVERYDAY, stick with the shake EVERYDAY. No days off, you have to want the change. An easy way to get started is to hit the treadmill/crosswalk. Spend an hour on it at brisk walk. Spend 15 to 30 min on an eliptical with moderate resistance, you should and will feel the "burn." Then go do some resistance training such as benchpress, weighted crunches, arm curls, leg presses, etc. Keep record of weight amounts and reps, increse them gradually by 5-10% every week. You WILL see results.<br>  <br>  - Weigh yourself at the start of your program. When you lift weights you will gain weight, muscle weighs more than fat. After two weeks check yourself again and so on.<br>  <br>  - Take a picture of yourself at day 1, day 14, day 28 and you'll see the improvement. Positive reinforcement. <br>  <br>  I've done this program since high school, I'm 25 now. I go through periods of in shape and out of shape. I'm about to start it all up again tomorrow, because it works. I'm 6 ft 1 in and weigh in around 230 pounds, 40 inch waist. I have 30 to drop and more if I choose to. Within 45 days I'll be back to where I'm the most comfortable. On what I've recomended you can actually burn over a half of a pound of fat everyday. In addition to what my advice is I will begin hitting the gym twice a day after week one. It's personal preference. <br>  <br>  Do bear in mind one thing - fitness products are an industry. Very few videos, pills, etc that you see advertised work at all. <br>  <br>  Good luck and commit yourself to your program. Remeber - it won't be easy, you'll want to quit, but the results are worth it.|`|xmudxxBHaa	The most important thing is that you eat balanced meals.Skipping meals can actually make you gain weight because you eat more at other meals.Try eating a piece of whole wheat toast for breakfast with penut butter(protein).At lunch eat a salad but with chicken on it .At dinner eat a balanced meal with veggies and meat.Drink lots of water ,exercise and don't binge.|`|82XQwyluaa	i know your momm would probably say this but " eat your greens" in other words VEGETABLES ,and eating meat everyday is not very wise either, try eating pasta with mashed potatoes  excersizing is important as well keep up the workouts, and drink plenty of WATER, green tea is excellent also..hope this helps!!|`|yeg19Tbnaa	You need to eat more, not less.  Eat 4-5 small meals/snacks a day and load up on veggies.  Eat every 3-4 hours and don't skip meals!  The exercise sounds good.  Keep it up!|`|eW5D8rKPaa	drink a lot of water before each meal.<br>  then you will get full. =)<br>  the water will make you full and not eat as much!|`|7OdkdFQOaa	no c a nutritionist|`|lbpSuEc2aa	well i kno this is kind of exspensive but i got wii fit and lost 4 pounds in 3 days!|`|aGx4gzDfaa	It can take a while... but just so you know bagels are really bad for you|`|mp3pIq65aa	YOU NEED TO EAT MORE!!!!<br>  I can't stress this enough. In order to lose weight, your metabolism has to be working as fast as you can get it. If you don't eat, then your metabolism will slow down and your body will go into starvation mode, stopping all weight loss progress. <br>  Use this calculation to find your basal metabolic rate (how many calories you burn if you do absolutely nothing but breath and sit):<br>  WOMEN: BMR = 655 + (9.6 x weight in kg) + (1.7 x height in cm) — (4.7 x age)<br>  Then multiply it by one of these factors:<br>  1.0 = sedentary (do nothing all day but eat potato chips and watch TV)<br>  <br>  1.2 = very light activity (desk job, no training, some walking)<br>  <br>  1.4 = light activity (no training, job might require some light physical labor)<br>  <br>  1.6 = moderate activity (most of us: a physically undemanding job, but training on a regular basis)<br>  <br>  1.8 = high activity (daily training plus a somewhat physically active job or lifestyle)<br>  <br>  2.0 = very high activity (twice-a-day training, sports + training. or training + a very demanding job)<br>  <br>  This is how many calories you need to eat to in order to maintain you weight. Cut this amount by 20% but not any more. Split these calories up between 4 to 6 meals in the day. Your metabolism will speed up and you will burn lots of fat. Also, light weightlifting is a much better fat burner than cardio. So do that also. Your food should consist mostly of protein and fat, with not too many carbs as they increase insulin levels and fat storage. Carbs are still important though, just not too many and int he form of fruits and veggies. Use this website to record your food: fitday.com<br>  I have used this program with awesome results. MAKE SURE YOU EAT!!! Your plan does not have enough food in it and you will feel and be unhealthy. It will take a few months at the least with any program you try, but this one will make you healthier in the long run.

t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain, weakness or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.<br>  <br>  This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.<br>  <br>  Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.<br>  <br>  I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.<br>  <br>  Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy. <br>  <br>  DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.<br>  <br>  A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.<br>  <br>  Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and anti–inflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.<br>  <br>  Narcotics didn’t help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.|`|EMNwWAuvaa	The usual problem there is that the muscles of the calf in particular are not functioning.  Those muscles work as an extra heart and pump fluids out of the lower limb.  So when those muscles are not working the pumping action is not taking place.  To decrease the edema elevate the leg and try and work those muscles.  For this see a physical therapist.  They should be able to help you through the use of massage, electrical stimulation, and specialized exercise programs.
9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Yes the 'starting on the first day of your period' rule extends to day three UNLESS you have a very short bleed. Some women only have two day periods, if this is the case then you could be at risk from pregnancy. Most women have a period which is 3-5 days in duration, if this is the case then you are fine.|`|DMQgIWa0aa	why didnt you use any contraceptives, thats so stupid...|`|ZuYTZ80Gaa	It is recommended when starting the pill you use another form of birth control for 7 days as it takes this long for the medication to be effective.  <br>  <br>  You've started the pill at the right time, but you should definitely be using condoms for a bit, it's not an instant effect.<br>  <br>  I would certainly get tested for pregnancy.|`|dYGLyVpzaa	As long as you've taken it around the first day of your period you should be fine. But how many days did you take the pill before you had sex? On my pill you're protected from about the third day you take it, it may depend on what brand you are on. I understand that you were keen to try it without a condom (my bf went crazy waiting haha) but you may want to have waited a while. If you're concerned you may be pregnant take a test, but as I say it depends on how long you waited. Just make sure that from now on you take it every day and you should be fine. Oh and you might wanna get tested for STIs as the pill doesn't protect you from them :)|`|Lt4MxnxXaa	i think u have to start the pill on the first day of ur period.

Well he spoke about using a condom, but to be even more safe I am planing to take the pill also. better safe than sorry, but incase if anything does happen talk to ur bf about what would happen if you came out pregnant.

6d18126e711f352c62adc9c85e6d27ceaa	Well the best way to treat congestion with out drugs is being properly hydrated.  The more Hydrated the body is, the more liquid can use used as a "thinner" for the mucus in the body.  They fluid is only excess fluid.  Your body will feed the important parts with water before using the rest to help hydrate and clear the mucus membranes in the airway.   <br>  <br>  If you want to try a medication, you can try Mucinex.  It is an over the counter med that is designed to thin mucus.  This drug is activated in the body by fluid so again you have to be hydrated for it to work properly.  Even though it is an over the counter medication, you may want to ask the pharmacist about it.  I am not a doctor so dont take my word for it. <br>  <br>  Hot showers and baths can help to.  Deep breathing and coughing exercises can clear the airway.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, good luck

Even if that scares you a little bit, crying in front of a stranger, it would do a whole lot of good for you. You could also if you have a church nearby go there and talk to the pastor, they arent normally judgmental at all and would probably be eager to help you out. If you have a really close freind talk to them about it too. The more you talk about it, the better things will get.|`|QjwBMQbjaa	Definately go to a counsellor, you dont want to become dependant on drugs (which drink and smoking are) you could end up needing counsellor for addiction down the line don't add this to your problems hun, try to get help now|`|flaOQzZoaa	I'm going to give you an answer as an emotional health therapist - so it is biased - but it will help - and it is professional advice.<br>  <br>  Firstly, you have a build up of issues and unresolved emotion. That stays inside you and grows. You have to get it out. In all honesty a counsellor mite be good if you want someone to talk to but it wont actually make your feelings any different. EFT would be really effective for you. I usualy encourage people to go to the official site www.emofree.com and download the free manual for how to do it yourself (which you should still do) but also i think a lot of those issues will be too confusing and emotional to deal with alone.<br>  <br>  The plus side of gettting EFT is that you dont have to tell the therapist about the experiences or memories - all you have to tell is HOW you FEEL about it - thats what is worked on. By using the tapping technique while tuning into these issues you lower the intensity of the negative emotion (or completely get rid of it permanantly) - this happens naturally within the amygdala (part of your brain that controls your stress response).<br>  <br>  Take a look at my website - there is more information and also videos of live EFT which mite help you get started. I also do telephone or web sessions which might be helpful for you because its not face to face which is much less scary. www.thelife-clinic.com<br>  <br>  Good luck, get in touch if you need advice or help<br>  <br>  Kelly.|`|Nntu0hZZaa	yes, i deff. think you should see a counsoler. Or maybe you should just try talking to someone you trust, and that doesnt have to be a counseler.<br>  you need to stop drinking. go to rehab for that.<br>  just have faith in god! (:|`|AA11080047	yes i would see a councillor but please don't smoke or drink to try and solve your problems because drink wont solve anything matter of fact it will make you more confused. so yes talk about your problems with somebody that is responsible and don't bottle it up either good luck.|`|l7g5JBEEaa	yes you need to talk to someone drinking and smoking will only lead to more problems, not to mention addictions.  You are hurt and it's okay to hurt just get some help now before things spiral out of control.
zZs6VJtzaa	I had a cyst on my ovary about 7 years ago and the pain got so bad i was rushed into hospital after putting up with it for over 2 months. Every other month the pain was really bad as it was that ovarys turn for my period felt like my kidneys most of the pain in my lower back and side.<br>  The doctors found it and took me to surgery right away and removed my whole right side ovary tubes the lot cos i had left it so long it twisted them up and was the size of a grapefruit.

I went to the doctor and I had to have a MRI. They said it might grow or just go away. It took a few months for the pain to stop but the cyst went away. So you could wait but if you feel like it probably won't go away, you should probably go to the doctor.
jNZ7yRbvaa	Sorry to tell you but a cold sore, and i mean any cold sore, is a form of herpes.  Since you are having herpes symptoms around your mouth, it's more than likely Type 1 Herpes Simplex Virus, which is usually not consistent with genital herpes, which essentially means that you probably didn't get this from having intercourse with someone.  HOWEVER, if you have a cold sore and you perform oral sex on someone, they can get herpes on their genitals from the cold sore on your mouth, and vice versa.  Close to 80% of all people end up with type 1 herpes by the time they die.  Its very common, and nothing to worry about, but you definitely should go to the doctor to see which type of herpes it is.|`|piI1aWOdaa	you can do a viral swab or wait and see if you get more..herpes returns|`|EqfWi7Ohaa	You can have a viral culture done at any medical office or clinic. They also can give you a variety of medications to lessen the length of time that you are infected. You could also use over the counter l-lysine to prevent them in the future.

6NZeItMAaa	SET REALISTIC GOALS <br>  <br>  “Lose 10 pounds in a week!”<br>  “Lose 20 pounds in 20 days!”<br>  “Lose 50 pounds by fairy dust!” <br>  <br>  You have seen all the ads … all promising to help you lose weight instantly. <br>  <br>  While some may work, many don’t. Sure, you can lose weight quick and many times you will, BUT…what they don’t tell you is that many times that rapid weight loss is water weight. AND IT WILL RETURN! <br>  <br>  So, what we have to do is set realistic and achievable goals. <br>  <br>  Remember our “One Pound at A Time” philosophy mentioned in the beginning? <br>  <br>  That is our immediate goal. Start with ONE POUND! Then another and another, etc. Pretty soon, you will be reaching your goals and starting to feel and see the changes happening. <br>  <br>  Once you have been successful with your smaller, short-term goals, start setting a little bit longer-term goals. “Today is Monday, July 9th. I will lose 5 pounds by July 31st.” That is not only reasonable, but achievable!|`|pquw7AdQaa	You could by starving and drinking only water with lemon but you would also be losing a lot of your muscle!<br>  A reasonable weight loss per week is 3-4lbs!<br>  If you lose much more than that it means you have lost some muscle too!|`|PTecquV6aa	Its totally possible to lose that much weight but not at all healthy to lose it in 3 months! As a mom of three (including 7 week old twins) I am totally on the lose some weight wagon. However because I'm breast feeding severe dieting is not an option (or at all in the game plan). The best advice I can tell you is this..  Make sure you are getting at the very least 1200 calories a day (although for myself 1500 is much more realistic when trying to lose weight).. your body needs that much just to function. Try to eat foods close to their natural state. Such as fresh or frozen veggies as opposed to fried. Try to cut out white carbs but keep in mind your body needs "healthy" carbs such as baked sweet potatoes a whole grain breads. Get rid of sodas even the diet kind! Water is the best thing for you and a nice cold glass of water can kill a craving for a little bit till you're sure you're actually hungry. Dont starve yourself and dont change your diet to the extreme, you'll set yourself up to crash and burn. Also throw in some walking or cardio for at least 30 mins a day 3-5 a week. You might not see a huge amount of weight loss in 3 months but you'll definitely see loss and it'll be much more healthy than extreme dieting. Hope this helps a little!|`|MPagmrD4aa	3 months = 12 weeks.<br>  Professionals say you can lose 1-2 pounds per week, so thats 24 pounds MAX.<br>  <br>  I disagree, and I think that you could lose 3-4 pounds weekly, so thats 48 pounds max.<br>  <br>  I dont think you can lose any more than that though!!<br>  <br>  do the best you can, and aim for 36-48 pounds in 3 months|`|FyuaaiKIaa	i would aim for 35 slower the better i am a personal weightloss coach if u need any help email me at saralen19@yahoo.com. dont set goals u cant make|`|7OdkdFQOaa	talk to a doctor|`|BoAPm53waa	The pattern for losing those excess pounds is not difficult - consume less food and move more often - the problems arise when we in reality try to put that into practice!

MoNZOqlOaa	She was told she had an abnormal smear test but she decided to ignore it. She's quoted as saying she was scared. She also ignored letters from doctors telling her to get procedure to remove those abnormal cells.|`|cOwFDh3Naa	Well, speaking from experience yes pap smears do catch abnormal cells. I have had my pap smears yearly from the age of 22. When I was 32 I had my first abnormal pap smear, my doctor immediately did a biopsy and advised my that we needed to freeze the cells from my cervix. They had the potential to turn cancerous. (they were abnormal). After that my pap smears were normal until I was 36 which was 4 years later. Once again he did a biopsy, but told me he did not need to freeze the cervix again because it was mild, and freezing too many good cells away could be harmful. He did another pap smear 3 months later, and it was normal. Now at 38 I just had my pap smear and it is normal. See abnormal cells can either go away or turn into cancer. Please don't call anyone a coward. You just don't know how you would feel if it was you. I freaked out, I had terrible thoughts, I wanted to pretend it was not happening. Fortunately, for me I had strong support from family and friends who encouraged me.|`|IUSCAdDtaa	Maybe it came quickly. I recently went through something simalar.

Management is in the form of Ointments, suppositories and creams. If your haemorrhoid's are quite bad then Haemorrhoidectomy or banding is the next option. <br>  <br>  Banding is done by a surgeon at an outpatient clinic. A  band is placed at the base of the haemorrhoids, cutting off the blood supply to the haemorrhoid which then dies and falls off the next day or so.<br>  <br>  If banding does not work then surgery to remove (cut away) the haemorrhoid is the next step. The operation is done under GA with high success rates.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	Unfortunately medical managements only reduce symptoms and can shrink them temporarily. Definitive management is surgical, usually banding, injection with sclerosing agents or more unusually these days classical haemorroidectomy.|`|JTOZJH7Xaa	It depends on what type of hemorrhoids you have.  With internal hemorrhoids, you may see bright red streaks of blood on toilet paper or bright red blood in the toilet bowl after you have a normal bowel movement. You may also see blood on the surface of the stool. <br>  <br>  For most external hemorrhoids, home treatment is all you need. This includes slowly adding fiber to your meals, drinking more water, and using over-the-counter ointments for a limited time to stop itching. You also may use stool softeners such as Colace or Benefiber. The same home treatment can be used for internal hemorrhoids.<br>  <br>  If your internal hemorrhoids are severe, you may need other treatment. The doctor may tie off the hemorrhoids with rubber bands or scar the tissue around the hemorrhoids. These treatments reduce the blood supply to the hemorrhoids so that they shrink or go away.  Surgery to remove hemorrhoids may be done if other treatments don't work.<br>  <br>  Healthy habits can help you prevent hemorrhoids or keep them from getting worse. Eat foods that have lots of fiber, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Also, drink plenty of water, and get some exercise on most days of the week.|`|xFTAeLtcaa	they are easy to get rid of by yourself,,,you only get them when your rushing on the toilet and your straining and pushing......thats when your force the veins out.<br>  surgery is an option, they will cut and seal the viens or remove them,,but its best to let them calm down and dont push when you go toilet.<br>  ive had them before when ive done just that,,but they have gone now, because i relaxed when using the toilet.

cqan7V3haa	the left coronary artery divides into the left anterior descending and the circumflex.  The LAD gives blood flow to the anterior (front) part of the heart and the circuflex gives blood to the lateral(sides) side.  So, if the entire LCA is blocked you will not get perfusion or oxygen to either the anterior or lateral sides of the heart. So when the heart is not getting oxygen it get ischemic.

Do not cross out anything from your " diet", save the 2 days that you do not work out for being able to eat junk foods.

Then they next thing you know they will give you the medicine probably through an IV and you won't feel or remember a thing.

You've done well tracking the number of days, it would also be helpful to your dr. if you'd track the level of severity on a scale of 1-10.  Ten being the worst, rate your headache on a daily basis.  Take this info with you to the dr.  Some headaches are migraine, no matter how sever or lack of severity.  Please seek treatment|`|Z1AIE6yVaa	There are a few things that could be the problem. When was the last time you had your eyes checked? That may be the problem.  I have bad acid reflux and i get headaches a lot because of that too.  Talk to your doctor if it gets worse.|`|211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	Its very unhealthy and unusual to have a headache that lasts more than a day.  Even though you have been fighting some anxiety and illness, this should not be happening.  It sounds like a cluster headache - and this alone can cause anxiety.  And, you are definitely working yourself up over this which is producing more anxiety.<br>  <br>  My recommendation would be see a doctor as soon as possible.  You do not have a tumor!!  But, you have something serious going on and it needs to be checked.  You are probably dehydrated, too, especially after an antibiotic.<br>  <br>  For more information about cluster headaches, check out the link below.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|Aej3lgQZaa	Yep. I've had that.<br>  <br>  I get migraines, but I know some people get it from sinus infections. Antibiotics won't clear up allergies. You need something that says "sinus" on it.<br>  <br>  Take ibuprofrin for pain. Less rebound headaches than most other pain killers.<br>  <br>  You can go ahead and see a doctor and get an MRI, but the odds of it being a brain tumor are very small. Is it possible? sure. But very unlikely.
ssuo801naa	Those symptoms are found in probably hundreds of different illnesses but the fact that there's a fever and swollen lymph nodes says your body is fighting infection. The white coating on the back of your throat sounds like strep throat, or possibly tonsillitis.

O0VQqIkDaa	Mine was $5880<br>  <br>  My Orthodontist office told me about a finance company who gives out loans just for braces.  My payments were $147 a month (I think).  So that may be an option for you.|`|BDPc9P4Faa	Mine cost $4000.

p3NW0Mstaa	Start by Eating a Breakfast like a King, lunch like a worker and dinner like a poor man.. By raising your metabolism in the morning and eating less as the day goes on you will have time to burn all the calories you intake.  Drink nothing but water after dinner, if a snack is needed, make it fruit, or something high in fiber.   Cut unneeded fats, like the extra butter on the bread, use canola oil or Olive oil for cooking.  And walk, swim or any exercise you like and enjoy life..|`|mh0QRDE9aa	At least you have the desire and the determination to get started.  So to do it right, start with a nutritionist and a personal trainer.  You can drop the trainer when you feel comfortable enough start using your bow flex.  Stay with the nutritionist for at least 6 months.  You can start walking to the tune of 10,000 steps per day (buy a pedometer that measures steps). Your goal of losing 10 lbs per month, you should lose 120 lbs in one year.  Good Luck!!|`|rxScdXM4aa	eat several smaller meals that include fresh fruits veggies nuts and seeds, and for a week try eating a meal with no meat. you can get protein from beans, brown rice, spinach and peanuts and potates.<br>  <br>  cut red meat as much as possible

Rk46lIBwaa	Your testicle is retreating up the inguinal canal. This is normally vestigial in adults, except in for example Sumo wrestlers who are trained from childhood to exercise their cremaster muscles and retract both testicles, keeping the canal open into adulthood. This protects them when they fight.<br>  <br>  In your case this movement of the testicle might put you at risk of torsion (twisting), which might prove serious. I would seek medical advise as to whether surgical fixation might be advised.|`|IM3QwSS2aa	okay join the same, redundant happens to us all group.<br>  <br>  /jerome|`|Y3Fp6oKxaa	It's perfectly normal son don't worry your head about it<br>  your not the first to ask this question here<br>  just relax enjoy & be happy<br>  All the best<br>  Dave|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	It's completely normal and there is nothing to worry about.

Sometimes they contract so far they seem to disappear.  This is perfectly ordinary, normal behavior.  Don't worry about it.<br>  EDIT:  Seeing Doctor Frank's answer (whom I respect) I will revise my advice.  The testicle is not supposed to stay contracted close to the body for an extended time after climax.  If it's not coming right back down, it could be going into the inguinal canal.  It's worth going to the doctor to have a look.|`|luCReaXcaa	This is not a serious matter at all.  For some reason, one of our testicles is on a 'short leash' for lack of a better term.  When the groin area is warm, it comes out of hiding; after certain body functions, like one you mention, it goes up inside the body but comes back out later.  Not every male is in this situation (you & I are unique).|`|ZzyEhSB1aa	Sorry, I know that this question is for the men BUT I was curious to read.<br>  <br>  But there is nothing strange about this at all. You may even find that even before you *** that this process is already happening and that your testicles are changing shape.<br>  <br>  If you are really concerned, then go and see your doctor but this is quite normal. <br>  It is always good to be observant about your body like you are - many are not.|`|AIsvSsEKaa	great question, man.<br>  <br>  What you are describing is not uncommon in guys. The inguinal rings which keep your testes from going back up inside have not totally closed, at least on one side. So you get that happening sometime.<br>  <br>  However, if the teste retracts up inside, it might not pop back out. This is a very painful condition that requires immediate medical attention.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to ask your doctor how to manage it. Good luck.|`|513a27e4679ce8c76c10d99baa79e5dfaa	man its nothing serious coz everyones testes is different|`|iFJZ9fFVaa	That doesnt happen to me.|`|6jAFnbfxaa	i have that as well but not wen i ***. its fine
VRSUyeqbaa	because with cutting a wrist, you are severing the brachial artery and they bleed to death|`|mqMhrmloaa	You've actually sat there and let someone bleed out of both cut arms? <br>  <br>  Or... You really let someone cut their wrists and just watched them? Cool. <br>  <br>  I didn't know people don't die when you cut off two of their major limbs.|`|z7l0BF1raa	Well its not that its the cut wrist that kills you it is the swift loss of blood! if you cut your arm off and just let it bleed you would die the same!|`|9BbV2xqIaa	if you cut one vein or artery length-wise (ie. your wrist), it takes your body longer to seal it up, which allows more blood to exit (and you pretty much never seal it up and so you die).<br>  <br>  if you cut a lot of veins or arteries as a cross section (ie. your arm being cut off), then your body can seal it up faster and you have a better chance of survival. meaning: it will take you longer to die.<br>  <br>  however, if both situations are left untreated, both will die. it's just that the wrist slash person will die faster than the arm cut off person.<br>  no doubt having your arm cut off would hurt more, as more nerves are being affected.|`|VYFdo6zmaa	you would die without your arms..... the same as you would if you sliced a wrist....you'd bleed out without medical attention..either way.|`|MTJs95Emaa	I think they both have the same death rate, it just depends on how fast they are treated.|`|hRqJ7Ii3aa	everything is closer to the surface on your wrist like your veins|`|6yrgVfJQaa	That's a good question.|`|ch8DC4z7aa	wow, just wondering what motivated you to ask such a question...I'm scared..lol

Usually used once braces are taken off, worn (nightly or all the time. w/e the doc says.) It doesn't hurt like braces do.. Another type of retainer is that for which some people are presciribed because they bite down really hard when they are sleeping and wake up with a massive migraine.. Then its just plastic used to cushion the biting.|`|ZyR8ezBwaa	If you need braces, but it is not very severe, you have the option to get a retainer. If your teeth aren't horrible, just a little crooked, your dentist will prescribe you a retainer. It is a lot less painful, and you can take it out of your mouth. It's a lot easier, and it doesn't hurt. If your dentist gives you the choice, then take the retainer. It will save you from braces.|`|El3DLcSqaa	its a metal piece u get in ur mouth after braces that you can remove and put back in.........theres a platform at the top of ur mouth then a thin wire that goes across ur teeth.........it helps them stay in place after ur braces straightened them out and it keeps them there while they get used to being where they are so they dont move back again..............ur only supposed to take it out while eating though|`|k6pfqWNNaa	A retainer is something that the orthodontist gives you after your braces come off. This is because the braces have shifted your teeth into a straight position. Your teeth are not used to this position so they might shift back into place. The retainer fits your teeth as to where they are after the braces, so it keeps them in place.|`|U1BUK70Kaa	It looks like normal braces but without the brackets and you can take them out thy are always worn after braves and sometimes worn instead of braces they stop your teeth from moving after having braces

rDb9ZLyfaa	You eat well don't you?  Do you drink caffeine?  You need to be on a strictly healthy diet and cut all sugar and caffeine out of your diet.  You really should see a dietitian.

There are dozens of medicines for migraines, and people usually have to try out several different meds before finding one that works.   None of the available drugs work for everyone.|`|CHCPnvksaa	I thought my doctor was crazy, but he put me on anti-depressants (Paxil) for my migraines. Surprisingly enough, it worked wonders. I used to get a migraine every day, so bad that you could physically see my eye pounding and blood would spray out my nose. The only down-side is that I slept a lot, like 14 hours a day. I went off Paxil after about 3 months because of that, but ever since, the daily migraines stopped. I get one maybe 2 or 3 times a month now, but I can tell when one is starting to develop, so I take 4 ibuprofen and drink tons of water and that prevents it.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	I have migraines, too, probably caused by hormonal fluctuations.<br>  <br>  Never heard of your drug.  I take desipramine for both headaches and depr.<br>  <br>  Call the dr.  Are you working with a neurologist?  If it's not getting relief on the double dose, you need to change meds.<br>  <br>  I have found Maxault to be very effective on my migraines.  If I take ibuprofen the very minute I feel a h/a coming on, sometimes I can avert it.<br>  <br>  I hope you feel better.  It's really hard to live a normal life when you have to keep stopping for migraines.<br>  <br>  TX Mom

73ee354f7bf2027a3e2d3c971ceb8834aa	Probably. If you have 9 of them, chances are at least 1 or 2 will leave a scar. But those are the kind of scars that will fade away (probably completely) in a few months.|`|BtEMrUFUaa	it depends on the way you take care of it and what color of skin you have by the sound of it they should only be a slight pink color and not too bad looking|`|nTuAbdtoaa	Yes, it will leave a scar. The pink  you are seeing is new skin growing over the cuts. The new skin is different age than the skin around it making it appear different, which is a scar. There are creams and lotions you can buy which help reduce the appearance of scars but after time they will appear much less obvious.|`|aVGj9yVfaa	maybe sometimes they do sometimes the don't just wait if you are very concerned about it get that stuff that makes scar's go away my cousin uses it and it works good.|`|CONpX6rhaa	Mine didn't.|`|wrYRxjHraa	no,They'll go away.

w5z0O8jlaa	It happened to me years ago. I was feeling kind of depressed, yet I had an "inner rage" that would cause me to get upset at the slightest thing.  If someone cut me of in traffic I would chase them down, swear, etc. Me, an average, professional woman, almost snapped one day and came this close to beating up a woman who cut me off! I guess I was paranoid, I thought everyone was talking about me, or staring at me. I was always yelling and people must have though I was nuts. I always seemed to be in a bad mood, and crying for no reason.  I finally couldn't take it anymore and saw my doctor thinking I was losing it.  My blood tests revealed that my thyroid levels were sky high!  I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and put on  med called PTU.  All that crazy stuff went away!  My blood levels are checked regularly even now (years later). I only had to take meds for a couple of years.|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	Yes, absolutely! Unfortunately, hyperthyroidism is all too often misdiagnosed as any manner of mental illness - depression, bipolar, psychosis, etc. This is because it can give you symptoms of all of those disorders. But once you get the thyroid under control, those feelings will go away. I had what we call "Grave's rage". I was angry with everyone and everything, including inanimate objects, which is completely irrational.|`|e04025e23b950e2f3fe00c64e34a3bf1aa	I think that is quite possible - your Dr. however might say otherwise|`|RtlL0PDcaa	yes your deppresion is due to thyroid problem. take proper tabs to treat your disease. since its a hormonal problem its quiet common for you to experience depression,hatred,excitement,anger etc. consult a good endocrinilogist|`|6TPCpZ0Oaa	i have the same problem i use some medication and i am able to control to an extent i will mail u some more info about it and some meditation tec best of luck|`|o4khP5pKaa	It may it can cause your body to release an extra amount or Estrogen which can cause mood swings.
ZuYTZ80Gaa	Absolutely! This is usually a congenital (developmental) deformity and can be fixed surgically.<br>  <br>  In adults, rectovaginal fistulas tend to be rarer, and associated more with people who are having abdominal surgeries, or people with inflammatory bowel disease.

I don't know how old you are or when you statred getting your period but if you just started getting it then it'll be a little irregular.|`|SB4N01OOaa	How far apart are your periods normally? If this is really abnormal for you then maybe you are, but in general women menstruate every 28-31 days give or take, so give it another week or so.
u70TaWI5aa	No you are breathing the same air as anyone else so you are getting the same pollution as you would if the smoker was not around. If there are cars around you their pollution you are breathing in, even when you are at your home. It does not really affect you worse then if you were around a smoker.|`|1YdeUn1Caa	Given the choice would you rather spend an evening in a room with 20 smokers or in a closed garage with a running car? Try them both, then come back, and let me know which is worse.|`|r3KlbLcfaa	well your not smoking the cigarette but people have had issues in their life because of second hand smoke.|`|jy52NZEjaa	TRUE|`|3di4X6VPaa	That's 2nd hand smoke.|`|SfdpJKoWaa	I think if you are sitting next to someone very rarely who smokes it wont have an effect on you. But if you are married to or spend really a lot of time with a heavy smoker it will have a harming effect on you. Not as much as the smoker but definitely something.|`|1dvYP7nfaa	Yes that's true and it is also called as passive smoking and it may lead to lung cancer.|`|RknydzkZaa	It's called second hand smoking.

You are likely hungry all the time because you are eating alot of refined sugars and you probably arent getting enough fiber in your diet either. so go for fiber filled snacks like almonds,whole grain toast, and fresh fruit. A snack that I eat all day long is sugar free strawberry jello with light cool whip(only 20 calories per serving) good luck!|`|oDz0FQpEaa	neither can I. I eat non stop all day.<br>  Your body usually craves food every three hours so try an think about splitting your day up into 5 smaller meals. Snacks will help you last until your next meal. If you feel you've ate too much then try walking every day to compensate this.<br>  Good luck<br>  Hope this helps|`|8bVoZGTYaa	Tape your mouth shut- I tried it & seriously it works, because if u rip it off it hurts and your then not in the mood.|`|awokgNY0aa	Most people don't function well if they try to go more then 3-4 hours between meals, so that is normal.  Instead of NOT eating regular meals or spacing them further apart, you should eat smaller meals every 2-3 hours (like half a sandwich, half an apple, and 8-10 ounces of water), and when the next meal is due eat the other half of the sandwich and apple and more water.  Yogurt with granola and a peace or banana or other fruit is good, for breakfast oatmeal with dried cranberries and raisins or bananas is a good choice.  Chicken and lean meats with a half a baked potato or vegetables is good for dinner and 2 hours later (save the other half for lunch the next day or for dinner the next night).  The true key to loosing weight is to burn more calories than you take in, so be careful of what you eat, but also step up the exercises.  You don't have to exercise at one certain time of the day (if you find yourself with 15 minutes between classes or on your lunch time walk briskly around the school halls or outside on the school grounds or around the block at home.  Do this as often as possible.  Run up and down the steps or take two at a time.

If you were to look at a muscle anatomy picture, you will find that what we call love handles are simply our gluteus medius which goes up and connects to the external obliques and goes down to and forms the gluteus maximus which is connected to your lats. Doing the following will help with the entire area to tighten and tone up your muscles and help burn the fat around them. Hope all of this helps do lunges, step-up kickbacks, walking downhill, running, leg raises without weight or very light weight, yoga, push ups, lat pull downs, pull ups rowing, and deadlifts.

I take Sundays off to rest and relax. Push pull for example is doing triceps extension with or without a break then doing biceps curls and adding reverse or regular crunches in there to make sure I get abs in and it cuts down on time. I do abs a lot to keep my core strong. I try to get all of the muscles in that area to work together on the same day. Do the amount of weight for what you want to accomplish. Say for toning, lightweight and high reps (15-20) and 3-4 sets. To build muscle, 2-3 sets and 10-12 reps. All beginners need to start with 1-2 sets and 8-10 reps with lightweights.

They shouldn't have a problem writing out your scrip if you have a medical history of chronic pain from a slipped disk. Just make sure your medical records arrive before you show up for your appointment, so it's clear that you're not a drug seeker.<br>  <br>  If your new doc won't give you a scrip in spite of your medical history, then find yourself a new one or ask for a referral to a pain management specialist. You shouldn't be forced to suffer just because you've moved to a new area. You just don't want to switch doctors too often, because then you might be accused of "doctor shopping."  ::rolls eyes:: Finding a pain management specialist first might even be your best option because of that.|`|PU5Qq1bIaa	You need to go see an orthopedic.

CuVnpxh3aa	Have you been checked for diabetes? Having low blood sugar can cause you to faint and lose weight. You may not be eating often enough. The Dr's say if you have low blood sugar you should eat 6 small meals a day and possibly a snack or 2 if your blood sugar gets too low. Dizziness is a symptom of low blood sugar. I would suggest you see your Dr and be checked for low blood sugar, sounds like you might have it. Drink plenty of fluids and the headache is probably where you fell. You say you eat plenty but just getting out of bed and going to shower tells me you didn't eat until after a shower and that is probably an everyday thing. You can try eating something before you get out of bed and see if you stop getting dizzy and passing out. Have a snack before getting out of bed and see if that helps.|`|6Ss31wyBaa	Well your head probably hurts from falling on it. Fainting is tricky because it could be from anything. If you are stressed, it could be the reason for the weightloss and stomach upset and even the fainting.

I would suggest going to the doctor because it could be something serious but if you refuse then make sure you are eating right and taking a multivitamin. And also drinking plenty of water, dehydration can cause all of your symptoms.|`|AA11839720	The exact same thing happened to me. i fainted randomly, and it could simply be from standing up too long while being really tired, or a sudden rush of blood... don't worry about it, but if it happens again you might want to see a doctor.|`|yrza9o9Taa	Migraines make your head hurt and stomach(feeling like throwing up), makes you off balance and dizzy, so it could be a migraine but not sure.

I would keep on eye out for any redness, bumps, fever, and runny nose. If any of these happen then I would take him in. It's really hard at his age as so many 2 year old are allergic to things and then grow out of them. My son Erik was allergic to eggs and would break out in hives within seconds of eating them at 2, but now at 10 years old is fine with eating them. Also I would just keep giving him Benadryl every 4 to 6 hours today just to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  So in my opinion I would just keep a close eye on him and see what happens. You will know, and feel it in your heart if you should take him in.

You should go to the doctor though, if you're over 18 you can get a pap without telling your mom you're not a virgin anymore either [since you're supposed to get one every year after turning 18 or when you become sexually active]. Try eating a lot of garlic and plain sugar free yogurt to speed up the fighting of the infection. [i just had my first yeast infection like 2 weeks ago and i have been sexually active for 10 years now]. You'll be fine sweetie... but you should go to the doc. They'll prescribe you a little tablet to take and then over the counter 7 day vaginal treatment. Good luck!|`|qNYW6Y97aa	You should see your doctor.  Otherwise, i suggest showering after intercourse.  I know that after using condoms i tend to have increased discharge after sex.  Also, when u have sex there is friction, you are all moist down there, sweating, a lot of moisture going on there so its easy for the natural pH down there to change a bit...id give it a day or two and see if it clears up...take a bath (so that your vagina gets flushed out)  don't use any douche for now...and then blow dry between your legs (...don't stick it in or anything!) to dry up the moisture (thats a gyno tip i got a while back really helps)...and if it is bothering you see your doctor.  Also, now that you are sexually active you should be tested for all STDs every 6 months and always use protection!  Yes your doctor will ask if you are sexually active and you HAVE TO BE HONEST.  Your doctor cannot disclose anything to your parents.  Its against the law.  You should see your doctor do not attempt to treat it on your own.  Also, the burning might be from having sex for a bit (the friction may cause little abrasions) and when you are in the moment it is feeling good you might be going at it pretty ahem..hard and fast, but the next day you cannot walk...i suggest using a latex compatible, water based lube...that will ease friction...and it feels better....but the soreness from going at it too much...thats just something that you gotta deal with...but at least the burning will be avoided...|`|Gql7tFXFaa	could also be a UTI - Urinary tract infection. Go see a doctor just to get it checked out properly.|`|YjaVT2JHaa	uhmm yeah, the gino wont tell your mom or dad so dont worry about that and yes you have to tell the gino that u are sexually active but its better then dealing with that
l8Xlae3paa	in the morning it gives you energy at night its good to stretch|`|jN83NgfTaa	It depends, exercise can sometimes make you tired and you feel the need to go sleep or it can wake you up. I exercise early in the morning. It gives me the energy I need to get through the day and I'm in bed by 10:00 p.m. Exercising before you go to bed is not a good idead. It wakes your body up and you most likely will not fall asleep for hours. I recommend working out in the morning or afternoon (maybe about 2-3 hrs befor you go to bed.)|`|tRNtFNHLaa	well it helps. <br>  but i find if you work out too much it makes  you really tired. <br>  which will make you sleep longer. <br>  haha|`|7OdkdFQOaa	Yea thats true

hUHwf0hmaa	Yes, it does sound like it's broken.<br>  <br>  I broke my thumb when I was playing softball as a kid and it sounds very similar to what happened.  The thing swelled up, turned black and blue almost immediately, and was completely useless.<br>  <br>  go see your doctor and he'll set it so it heals properly, and give you some nice pain pills.  The ice is a good thing, but it needs to ahve the bone set, and it can be dangerous if you don't.|`|mPuRl4tbaa	yes its broken|`|Ff15178saa	BROKEN - when it starts to swell and bruise with throbbing them are all the signs of a fracture the part that worries me is that your hearing all kinds of cracking when you try n move it .. if you do not get it put into a cast asap you will have a life time trouble with arthritis|`|EyaD1AvHaa	It is very likely broken. I would recommend seeing a doctor.<br>  <br>  I broke my thumb falling off a horse three years ago. At first, it did not hurt because of the adrenaline. But my whole thumb was extremely swollen and completely purple. I iced it for three days before going to the ER. And yes, I could move it a bit, because of the location of the break. <br>  <br>  If it hasn't gotten any better, there is a good chance you broke it.|`|tRNtFNHLaa	yes, but you should make sure at the hospital.

ImDRDBPKaa	They say that you take your right hand and put your thumb on your belly button lay it flat and point your other fingers down. Where your middle finger ends is where your appendix is. If the pain is there it is possible that it is your appendix. When you push on it it may not hurt, it actually may relieve the pain. In my opinion, you should get to the doctor whenever possible.<br>  <br>  J|`|LCMCrmQTaa	It isnt ur appendix, if u arent crying in pain or throwing up then ur fine. especially if its been going on for a while since appendicitis is an acute disorder. Lots of muscles in that area, could be that or your bowels try taking a bowel movement and drinking a lot of water. Possibly gas bubble trapped?|`|Zupw5rilaa	You could have pulled a muscle or it could be your appendix's.
4CgYIHWYaa	When you get your braces, you usually get a consultation before with moulds and x-rays if you haven't so already. When you get your braces you will have them cleaned by the orthodontist and they will then glue each bracket onto the tooth ( make sure you try not to taste the glue it doesn't taste very nice ). They then attach wires through the brackets and secure them with little sort of elastic bands to hold the wire in place ( you can usually choose colours ). Getting the braces put on at the time doesn't hurt but afterwards can be uncomfortable so just take pain killers and it shouldn't hurt too much.|`|gS3I2lsBaa	Don't be nervous! It's a long process though. Make sure you wash your teeth well. Then they will put glue on your teeth , then they put the bracket deal. They put wire and tighten it.
J1J47FIAaa	Omg use the spell check, please! You need to go back to english class.
tq1eQwRZaa	I am kind of the opposite. I'm 5'1 and 85 lbs, which many people think is like too skinny. But my arms are kinda bigger than you'd expect, like 8 inches around, not cuz of fat but cuz of muscle. I hate them. My chest is bony (my ribs are visible) and i have abs lol but my thighs are like 15 inches around, which is supposedly really skinny. and theyre also muscular. One thing you can do is get an ab/butt workout video or one that focuses on your legs so you can tone them up. And to bulk up your upper body, you can weightlift and eat protein bars (idk)|`|e48yQ1dKaa	Ugh I have the same problem. From the waist up I look like the smallest little thing, but from my butt to my thighs to my calves I am fat :/ I hate it..|`|MPagmrD4aa	I understand...I gain no weight in my arms and thighs, but all in my tummy!!!|`|zZ3MGvPHaa	hey try pitiless  or sit ups
WrNWqnvEaa	well it seem you've overdone it. Your body can take but so much and it seems like no big deal, you probably just agitated your vessels but it should clear up.|`|Nytn8HB8aa	Well, I know that when you exercise, your body needs to let off increased amount of heat. Blood flow increases to help facilitate this (because sweating might not be enough to help get rid of the heat) and that is why your face turns red - blood flow! <br>  <br>  It shouldn't last hours after the fact. My guess would be that capillaries were stressed by the amount of blood flow, but if that were the case, the would look like small bruises, not red dots. If the dots persist, I would probably see my doctor. <br>  <br>  It is possible, though, that it just took you a long time to cool down.|`|uVi9tpBxaa	cuz ur white|`|S0iqDSSPaa	Sounds like tiny busted blood vessels in your face. Maybe you have high blood pressure. You better get it checked out.|`|t0X1cEh7aa	Ask an adult, maybe not consult a doctor immediately, about it.
uKmNYqGgaa	It does sound like you have your hands full...  Call your local Mental Health Agency and tell them what you've written here, and ask them how and where you can get help for your husband - and probably you too, since you need to understand and know how to deal with this.<br>   <br>  Has he admitted to having the problem?  That's probably necessary, if he doesn't think he has a problem it'll be all that much harder for you to help him.<br>   <br>  Best of Luck :-)|`|3mIHxillaa	Good luck.

wwP3ONCFaa	How many did you take? An overdose of Advil can cause damage to your stomach or intestines. The maximum amount of Advil for adults is 800 milligrams per dose or 3200 mg per day (4 maximum doses). Use only the smallest amount of Advil needed to get relief from your pain, swelling, or fever. Avoid taking Advil if you are taking aspirin to prevent stroke or heart attack. Advil can make aspirin less effective in protecting your heart and blood vessels. If you must use both medications, take the Advil at least 8 hours before or 30 minutes after you take the aspirin (non-enteric coated form). Do not drink alcohol while taking Advil. Alcohol can increase your risk of stomach bleeding caused by Advil.|`|AA10450066	You will get very sick if you did.You'll need to read the bottle or box it came in and it will tell you.You can also call the poison control 800 number and they'll let you know exactly what to do.It'll be listed in your phone book with the rest of the emergency number's or you can get it from 411 but decide quickly what you want to do and do it.Accident or not any medication, whether it's OTC or not can kill you.|`|VnVmWn5raa	look on the back of the advil bottle for accidental overdose,<br>  and if your really having problems just go to the ER.|`|gu5fBjrdaa	if you take advil for too long or take too much, you can cause your stomache to bleed. yeah not good. but thats only if you take a TON of advil|`|ZswKDrpYaa	Sorry to say but you'll be dead in about 4 hours.<br>  Enjoy!|`|lOpjLnyIaa	how much did u take?|`|V7vmx6JPaa	when my friend took too many her stomach started to feel really queasy and she called my other friends dad who is a dr. and he said it will eat the lining of your stomach. thats why they're recommeded to be taken w/ food. so just be careful w/ it and only take the suggested dose or more often if your headache or whatever hasnt gone away yet.

XNc5moJEaa	Since you are a nursing student, is there a dental hygiene program or assisting program at your school? If so, go talk to the program director. They get great rates from crest and might be able to hook you up. Dental offices and schools get them WAY cheaper than any drug or department store will sell them.

They were really nice toothbrushes too that were sold for over $2 @ WalMart.|`|kgczgM3Raa	Call some local dental offices and explain what you are trying to do - often, companies will send them boxes of samples, and you might be able to get those for free from them.

Nobody else in my family has it including my sister who is younger than me.<br>  <br>  If you check out the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation's site, they have the information you are looking for plus a live chat and hotline run by healthcare experts, an open forum where you can post this question to others who have children with IBD, information on locating a local CCFA chapter near you....some even have meetings just for kids and their parents, as well as diet, latest meds, surgery, coping skills, etc.<br>  <br>  It's a cr@pshoot basically as to who will get it and who it will miss. Definitely check out CCFA's site and post your question to other parents like yourself. I hope you are doing well.|`|L5qWHzePaa	Crohn's disease is not a hereditary disease in that it is not passed from parent to child like some diseases are. There is, however, a familial incidence so that in the extended family there may be more than one person with the disease. Some genetic markers have been identified but these are not entirely conclusive.<br>  <br>  So, is it likely your daughter might get it? She is probably at a higher risk. Is that your fault? No. You didn't pass it to her.

ZjhQ6PL8aa	Sounds like you had a bout of palpitations.  There are many causes of palpitations some of them unknown.  I've met a few people with eating disorders who have experienced palpitations most often an electrolyte imbalance and stress are the causes of them.  Without an EKG it's very difficult to know what your heart did at the time.  People with eating disorders do die it's not usually due to a heart attack though.  It's usually an electrolyte imbalance which leads to arrhythmias causing cardiac arrest.  You should seek help for your eating disorder<br>  <br>  Keep in mind only a physician can diagnose you in person.|`|mTSYemNgaa	It sounds like a heart murmur. You should see a cardiologist.

nwuL7M7saa	Question: What is a prostate and why do men need it?<br>  <br>  Answer: The prostate is gland that is part of the male reproductive system. It is shaped like a walnut and is about 1.2 inches across. One of its functions is to make part of semen, the fluid produced during ejaculation. This fluid is called prostate fluid. This fluid also keeps sperm healthy for fertilization.<br>  <br>  The urethra runs through the prostate gland. This is why many men with prostate cancer experience urinary difficulties. If a tumor grows, it can put pressure on the urethra, ultimately slowing the flow of urine or not allowing the flow at all.|`|J8uhpecYaa	The gland underneath the scrotum (in men).|`|XmD61yBpaa	Its that thing the doctor is looking for when he puts his finger up your bum|`|pyBHdJ90aa	A gland that secretes your man juice and surrounds your urethra.

0TT5q0cUaa	are you talking of sex??<br>  Sexual intercourse is not merely a physical act with your partner. It is important that both of you are ready for it and enjoy it for fulfilment. It is, therefore, necessary that the mood be right and both partners be adequately aroused sexually. Arousal can be heightened by foreplay, which is an important part of intercourse. <br>  <br>  In foreplay, the partners fondle and kiss each other, and stroke each other's genitals. This increases the sexual urges and also lubricates the sex organs to facilitate a pain-free intercourse. As a result of the sexual arousal during foreplay, the man’s penis becomes filled with blood, causing it to become erect. This process is called an erection. <br>  <br>  Sexual intercourse involves the male inserting his erect penis into the vagina of the woman. This must be done slowly and gently so as not to cause much discomfort to the woman. In a virgin, the initial insertion can be extremely painful, and this discomfort may be reduced with the help of lubricating creams. After this, the penis is moved forward and backwards in the vagina without withdrawing it completely. This rhythmic motion is continued till both partners reach their orgasm. An orgasm is a feeling of extreme pleasure that starts from the genital region and washes over the whole body. It ends in a climax, which is a state of heightened pleasure for both the partners.<br>  <br>  In the male, the orgasm is usually reached with the discharge of semen. In the female, there is a white discharge from the vagina. After an orgasm is reached, the male’s penis becomes deflated again and comes out of the vagina easily.

NLAek2bJaa	I would never get veneers for a lot of reasons. Its better to keep your real teeth and use them for their purpose instead of getting fake teeth that you cant use, its only for appearance.  There are different options you can take to make your teeth look better. Your dentist and shape and contour them a little to make them look nicer or a retainer to straighten them and you can bleach them to whiten them. Dont ruin your teeth with veneers because they are exactly like fake finger nails. They are very brittle and fragile. You will not be able to bite into anything again. They can easily pop off and you would have to constantly get them re cemented back on. They are only a cosmetic thing, not a healthy thing for your teeth. Basically, they cut down your tooth in front for that porcelain to fit right over the top. They require more maintenance and if not taken care of properly, decay can form under them and cause more problems. Decay has more of a chance in entering the pulp of your tooth resulting a root canal, trust me those are not the greatest. None of this is cheap either. Trust me, its a waste of money. Keep your real teeth, just think about how you can make them look better and I bet that will be cheaper.

Just like it doesn't stop premature ejaculation.  <br>  <br>  Finally, if you can *** whilst tugging yourself off then you're physically  OK - it's all in your head.<br>  <br>  Maybe you've had a lot of wanks and are used to the feel of that to get you off.  Once you're with a girl the different sensation doesn't quite get you there, gets you anxious then wham - it's never going to happen.<br>  <br>  So forget the blue pill, take a chill pill and don't focus on "I never *** when I'm with a girl" because it's a self fulfilling prophesy.
jh00NAj3aa	You don't say when your period is supposed to come.  Most likely the penicillan might be affecting things.  Medications have affected my periods in the past.|`|fQch3BkEaa	could be who knows|`|KZfYzhZRaa	well im not a doctor but i think your pregnant you should really get a pregnancy test and see a doctor oh and tell your boyfriend the minute you can if you are...congrats!|`|r9HpqAECaa	it generally takes a whole months cycle on the pill before they can be used as a form of birth control. So my next question would be how long were you off of your old pill before going on the new one? <br>  <br>  Your body could just be readjusting to the new pill but I do believe that when you switch it still takes one full cycle to be effective. The bleeding and "morning sickness" although are signs of pregnancy could also be the fact that you have switched your pill recently. <br>  <br>  If you have any doubts that you are pregnant get off of the pill IMMEDIATELY and make an appointment with your OBGYN who  can run urine tests that are more sensitive then the ones in the store. If you do not have an OBGYN there are many clinics, such as planned parenthood, that also have these tests and sometimes blood tests. <br>  <br>  Good Luck
VM6XG5c3aa	There could be a few things going on here.. but first I'd want to explore the thyroid thing a bit more... <br>  <br>  You say TSH is normal.. well, 'normal' TSH is relative.<br>  <br>  Is it normal compared to the OLD lab ranges or the CURRENT lab ranges?<br>  <br>  Is it normal taking into consideration the symptoms that you've listed?<br>  <br>  Considering your symptoms, if your TSH is over 2.0, I'd want to have further testing done.... like perhaps getting thyroid hormone levels Free T4 and Free T3, checked, TSH is a pituitary hormone, not a thyroid hormone.<br>  <br>  If your Free T3 is lower in it's range, rather than higher in it's range.. there could indeed be a problem with your thyroid hormone levels.<br>  <br>  Then it's time to check thyroid antibody levels.<br>  <br>  There are a LOT of symptoms associated with thyroid disorders and not everyone presents with the same ones, and some only present with a few. And the earlier in the process the fewer symptoms will be experienced.<br>  <br>  Getting a few more tests done might shed some light, and worse case scenario is that you can indeed right off a thyroid disorder as a possibility<br>  <br>  Have you been monitoring your body temp? Is it actually running low? If so that is indicating that you have a low metabolic rate... <br>  <br>  One thought is that since you do have a low level of body fat that your body may be having trouble with maintaining proper gland function if your food intake is too low and you have a tendency toward thyroid problems to begin with.<br>  <br>  Under eating challenges how the body produces thyroid hormone and can increase the stresses with maintaining healthy thyroid hormone levels.|`|86VgnUmQaa	I think that it could very well be your lack of body fat. <br>  <br>  My friend is really super short and skinny, and whenever we go swimming we she has to get out every 25 minutes and rinse off in the showers with super hot water. <br>  <br>  Eat some fatty greasy foods! It could help you a bit.|`|rSJHzlzsaa	I'd trade you in a heartbeat. I'm ALWAYS hot.

Hope this helps whether I get the 10 points or not.|`|fbGv4iZ1aa	Well you could try to equivilate the amount of money one spends on drugs... verses  what they could buy.   <br>  <br>    Such as  have a picture of marajuana and a oz. size then put a or and use a picture like a couple of cd's or concert tickets. ect with other drugs and then caption it with...

8Xbc4ok1aa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth .

AA12253037	depending on your state.  in Colorado it's yes but you have to be able to prove it to the social security admin.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  However, knowing that a condition can be disabling does not tell you HOW to prove that social phobia is disabling in your case.<br>  <br>  As in any Social Security disability case, you have to show that social phobia keeps you from being able to engage in substantial gainful activity (generally full time work).<br>  <br>  Social phobia most likely affects your ability to work by making it impossible for you to have more than very occasional contact with the public, co-workers, or supervisors.

wwP3ONCFaa	Not Necessarily. BUT don't spread your germs,  when you need to cough, go ahead and cough. When you need to blow your nose, go ahead and blow. But cough and sneeze into disposable tissues instead of setting germs free in the environment, then promptly throw the tissue away and wash your hands. Your healthy friends and family who want to stay that way will appreciate it.<br>  <br>  Also Take Vitamin C.Vitamin C works in the body as a scavenger, picking up all sorts of trash—including virus trash,It can shorten the length of a cold from seven days to maybe two or three days.<br>  <br>  Load up on liquids. Drink six to eight glasses of water, juice, tea, and other mostly clear liquids daily.This will replace important fluids lost during a cold and help flush out impurities that may be preying on your system.|`|rprzoBjCaa	No you are not unless you cough or sneeze on someone luv ya

NQGpw0x4aa	the clear rubber bands that go on the brackets only turn yellow if you don't brush your teeth enough. i would not get color at all. it makes you look like you have food stuck in your teeth. i had silver brackets with the clear rubber bands around them. i stuck to that for the year and a half i had them.|`|t9UzwM8Paa	SILVER! You will regret getting a color|`|v2gyKb9Zaa	you can't get colored brackets, only the bands. & you should go with silver, it looks simple & less noticable:) unless you're still in elementary or middle  school, colored ones look a little childish in my opinion especially when it's two colors in a pattern. but if you really want colored, i think red or teal look best ! i had red ones a long time ago once & they seriously made my teeth look whiter. it's like wearing red lipstick :D|`|fpS90nx4aa	the color doesn't come in the brackets they're little rubber bands that they put around the brackets and clear yellow and gold colors do not make ur teeth look yellow i promise u that.i had braces before and i wore those colors at times.just make sure u brush ur teeth really good and ull be fine..i say you go for color but ur going to have a lot of appointments so im sure ur going to be able to have a lot of different options each time you go.every time i went to my appointments i would switch it up.be creative and good luck|`|Y7O7MkLdaa	i have silver braces, with colour bands around them, i dont know if thats what you mean, but ya you can choose like any colour you want for your braces.|`|qSwthDsPaa	your actual braces wont be a color. the rubber bands will be though and youll probably be able to change them every month. im pretty sure your braces will be silver but i would get silver rubber band because it will make our braces less noticable|`|lt44hIvBaa	its not actually the brackets that you change the color of but there are tiny colored bands around the bracket to hold the wire.

It's like a hallucination except that it's all in your thoughts and beliefs that you are fat. Anorexia is often deadly because you cut off the necessary supply of nutrients so your body shuts down. Often anorexic people cut out all fat out of their diet and become sick because of it. You body can not exist without getting a supply of fat every day - it needs fat and protein to function normally.|`|yAYjTp2Paa	you are too skinny for your height <br>  best thing to do is visit the doctor and ask cause i dont have an M.D.<br>  lol

AA10625552	Well it sounds like you are much better off without him.  Stop talking to him, and your confidence will get better.

He wants to stop the relationship right where its at and end it. but if you keep going back he will just keep on doing wat hes doing. If you look through a guys POV some girls get clingy and he probably thinks that he should end it b4 it gets too much for him. but for the life threat he is trying to scare you away from him. but so not cool. . . I have a friend that says that all the time. "no one wants me" "I'm ugly" She says it all the time its just a phrase that will pass after a demeaning break up. If you want we can talk. I deal with these types of cases all the time,|`|I40iBJdHaa	"I just let him speak to me like it cus i'm like who else is gonna want me.."<br>  no! don't ever think that! you can do so much better. you don't need that. even if he does like you again one day, you should turn him down. you will find someone who loves you and treats you the way you should be treated. please please stand up for yourself! remember you are worth it. i understand that you still care, it's hard to let go of feelings sometimes. but really, he doesn't even deserve the opportunity to even speak to you.|`|AA11476749	Why he says these things to you is anyone's guess.  He obviously doesn't care that he hurts you, so my question to you is this:  Why communicate with a guy who lives to torment you?<br>  <br>  It's obviously time for you to refuse his calls, e-mails, and the like.  Don't "care" for the jerk.|`|l1QzfK8uaa	I think the best advice for this is end communications all together. He is obviously no good to you. You should be able to find someone better.

There is absolutely no excuse.|`|YZ1PvyQFaa	Try to go to a quiet place like ur religious place and think if ur bf deserves to be ur bf and if not then move on.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	Well, why do you keep talking to him then? Block him, delete his number from your cell, just erase him from your memory.<br>  <br>  > u say block him, delete his number.. i can't its so hard to do.. i just <br>  > feel like one day he might like me again but i know it will never <br>  > happen..<br>  <br>  Yeah, I knew you were gonna say that. That's why we can't have nice things. Girlie, there's ~150 million males in this country. Cut away a 100m because they're too old or too young, leaves 50m. Drop -generously- 5m, because they're gay.We're at 45m.  Remove another 40m, because they're not at all your type, too tall, too skinny, too fat, nasty teeth, wrong politics, too poor, too rich. Leaves 5m. Remove 4m because they're geographically out of reach, although the Internet should solve that problem.<br>  So surely you should be able to find one guy out of a million who's to your liking, loves you just the way you are and cares for you, isn't being an insensitive jerk and is otherwise the perfect match for both of you.<br>  <br>  Now why in the world would you let yourself get abused by an asshole who isn't even right for you, doesn't want you, and is being nasty to you?<br>  <br>  Yes, that was a rather wordy way of saying there's plenty of fish in the sea.|`|qRfZ7q9iaa	he has self esteem problems. when guys say things like that to a women it makes him feel more like a man. but it don't work like that. he's a coward. if he gets pleasure from that, he shouldn't even be talking to girls.|`|lEK0eIOFaa	just leave him alone!<br>  hes obviously not intrested and you taking the hint,<br>  although sound much of a hint anymore,<br>  more of an order!<br>  just back off<br>  stop talking to him<br>  and delete him from your mind!|`|Iqf0kXQGaa	u must like to be berated if u keep talking to this jerk. stop the cycle now or the next guy is going to b just like him or worse.|`|O2s8tLQzaa	I feel sorry.<br>  <br>  Yeah, sweetie.

If he did he wouldn't be putting you down. How can you get over him if you keep communicating with him. Let him go and try to get yourself together. God will definitleey send you somebody, you don't have to go out looking and you don't have to put up with his mess. Show him that you don't need him to be happy because right now he has a hold on yoiu and that's not good.

frgnKHs3aa	Good morning, <br>  My boyfriend has type 2 and suffers from the same thing, its called Neuropathy. my boyfriend has it in his hands and feet. usually when his feet start to hurt i pull out the foot massage bath ( its the same thing us women use for at home pedicures) After he soaks his feet in warm water with the massager on i'll take one foot out and massage it with lotion then repeat on the other foot. this seems to help him for a couple of days. I do the same thing with his hands. alot of people say its because a person is overweight that why there feet hurt when they have diabetes but my BF is like 160lbs tall a skinny so i know its not that. I hope this helps you and HIM out. you know its nice to know i'm not the only person out there taking care of my man and his diabetes. do you ever get frustrated??? i'd love to keep in touch maybe swap techniques on how to keep these guys healthy and pain free.|`|5703c028626fd0f9cd862fa2e78925e2aa	IT SOUNDS MORE ARTHRITIS AND NOT HIS DIABETES ACTING UP.

12VQ4ETcaa	It's amazing the way a family can gang up on one member.  Mine used to do that too.  Finally I told my parents, "I need you to only say things that are supportive or not talk about my personal life, or I'm not going to be able to spend time with you any more."  They were really mad, but oddly enough, it worked.  Now when we spend time together we talk about the news and stuff, and if they ever make comments about my life it's to be supportive or just ask how I'm doing.<br>  <br>  Your family probably believes they are helping you.  But their negativity can really drag you down.  At your age, it's best to start separating yourself from them and spending less time with them.|`|EZt7ZHIiaa	I think a lot of it depends on the situation and what you are doing that is causing them to gang up on you.  If you aren't doing anything wrong and your intentions are good, then I can understand how you would feel like you are the target or that you are being treated unfairly.  If you are doing something to provoke them or cause a disruption in the family, that is a different story.  Either way, when there is that much conflict within the family, it is normal to feel the way that you are feeling.  I would suggest that you try to talk to someone friend/relative/professional to see if you can sort it out and decide how to best handle this appropriately.  It does sounds like something isn't right, and sometimes when there is tension amongst other family members it can get taken out on the wrong person.  Good luck.|`|ecbe0658102674f8ad91e0162ac2a91faa	Well, I lough sometimes - many times - at my ***.<br>  If the LIFE we see around is what we get ... must we be serious about it, after all?<br>  <br>  Let's say, one mom is struggling her entire life with everything, all alone (rise a child, build the own house with everything in it, help that child with everything - schools & own house, rise the grandchildren)<br>  and what does she get into the end of her life time, when the humans are in their most needs?<br>  She rests alone! Or even worse, she has to struggle once again, but this time with the two children of her grown child gone in the wide world to seek for his happines ?!?<br>  <br>  Let's see, on the other hand, the father of the same child, who never ever did something for his own child. Except he gave few explanation about the way he must drive a car (before his son to have his driving license), and he pushed him far further, to have much more confidence in himself into the car driving. NOTHING else, nothing more, for their entire life time.<br>  What does this father get into the end of his life, when the humans are in their most needs? Does he rests alone, anything even worse?<br>  NO! Not at all ! He has another loving wife, who is doing almost everything for him to be well.<br>  His first wife, the mother of his son is somehow still weeping any rare time she's hearing his name :)<br>  and his son, before he leaves his country to know the wide world, put his dad into the possesion of his personal car - a present to his dad!<br>  <br>  This isn't a soap opera, but real life :)<br>  <br>  Don't worry, be happy!<br>  <br>  No one is giving/doing something, but if they want to! No other reason.<br>  It is just OUR OWN WILL :-)<br>  <br>  <br>  Thanks to you, I got an idea:<br>  <br>  I will ask myself each morning WHAT way do I like to live my life for that day !?!<br>  A little self diagnostic? A little step of a huge life :(<br>  ??<br>  <br>  Hug & thank you|`|q4tTabfjaa	If I do something I think is right, and my entire family ganged up on me and make me feel like an idiot then I would consider myself bullied and not supported. As a result, I would also get upset and end up feeling upset and get angry thoughts towards them.  I think you are right to want to emotionally detach yourself from them.  At your age, you can, but I suggest you pity them and not yourself.  You sound like a wonderful person, having to put up with a distressing situation and should not allow others to change who you are.  Please stay that wonderful sensitive person that you are, but protect yourself from them by making new friends and best not live too close to the family.|`|A4yrPokPaa	I have been feeling the same way.  It will get better, stressing about the small stuff is not going to help at all though.  You do whatever YOU think is right, dont worry about what they think..even though it is your family and that can make it hard..keep strong..prove them wrong!!

On South Beach, you can lose 8-13lbs the first 2 wks.

I went to the bathroom a lot too. (urinate) My grandma thought this was unusual so my mom took me to the doctor who did some tests and determined I had diabetes. I wouldn't wait. I would check as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  I disagree with being severely sick. I only had the symptoms above and I'm type 1|`|QqY8YgGDaa	You can take your classmates parents<br>  -there are several methods|`|iK3YYRaTaa	You have very little symptoms for diabetes. But many people have diabetes with no symptoms until neuropathy or excessive peeing ETC. plague them.If you are fixated on this , your school work will suffer. So I suppose you must talk to your mother. She will have to make that decision.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	Unless you are really very ill and vomiting and stuff, your test can probably wait.  Are you experiencing severe symptoms?  Because you are a teenage girl, and a hundred teen girls post on here thinking they have diabetes, I am willing to bet that you don't have diabetes.  Type 1 diabetes (the type most teens suffer from) makes people quite sick before their diagnosis.  It's not subtle like type 2.  You would be thowing up and and feeling so sick that even your grandparents would suggest you see the doctor.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you should call the doctor's office and speak to the doctor or one of his/her staff.  Explain your symptoms and ask what you should do.|`|ZgUPOXB8aa	Don't think you have it, it could be stress, which would make sense since your moms in the hospital and your probably at your grandparents not your home. It could also be PMS. If it's diabetes there are way more symptoms you will notice before stomach pain.|`|XGkv5Y8Kaa	You don't say how old you are-you need to go to the Dr.There are tests that will need to be analyzed.A small sample of blood is required to determine it you are diabetic.Your blood  sugar should  be between 80 and 125.A Dr will determine what ,if anything,needs to be done.You should see your Dr as soon as possible.|`|XkWd08Uvaa	depending upon the necessity  you can choose the company|`|o7jn78CLaa	when you go to see your mom in the hospital you could share your concerns with any of her nurses and they can do a fingerstick on you and let you know if the reading is within normal limits in about 30 seconds. After that you and your mom can take that information and go from there.
FVDbVcnCaa	I would say do what makes you feel comfy. If your really attracted to men why not maturbate to them? It's not like some guy or girl is right there next to you watching and judging you right?
B12E4rYiaa	It depends on what your body frame is small medium or large. Someone small frames at 5 feet should be like 100 pounds or less. A medium frame 100-110 and large frame 110- 115 and it depends on how they carry the weight and how it's distributed. <br>  <br>  To lose weight the best combination is cardio combined with weight training. Eat maybe 1500 calories keep track of all you eat and drink with a calorie chart. Do the workout 3-5 days a week. You can get ideas and visuals on youtube on cardio and weight training.|`|E4WGxzXzaa	you can calculate your bmi (body mass index) on this website. it will give you an idea of what your ideal weight should be for your height. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/bmicalc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/bmicalc....</a><br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|FsS7MfFyaa	The thing you want to find out is what most of your weight is.  Is it mostly muscle or fat.  If its fat, then just eat healthy and maybe jog 3 times a week with push ups and sit ups.  If its muscle, then keep working out a little and tighten it up =]|`|seMXuWwxaa	That is not overweight at all, I would say that is healthy weight.  Just stay active, run, bike, go outside and do stuff, and that will help you stay healthy.
YFAPpzngaa	I have had the same problem as you quite frequently and I went to my physician.  To make a long story short, there are a few prescriptions that can be tried and one of them might be just right for you.  In my case it was Nasacort.  Obviously, this won't work for everyone, but in my case it was the one that worked the best.  There are still times that, like you I find I must use the nasal decongestants sold in the drug stores, and I'm aware that they don't recommend  usage on an ongoing basis, but by using Nasacort, I find that I only need the other decongestant 2 or 3 times a month.  <br>  <br>  I hope that this helps you because I know how frustrating it is to not be able to breathe when trying to get to sleep.  Good Luck!|`|s30Duwdraa	You probably have really dry air in your room.  have you tried a humidifier? <br>  <br>  My son had the same problem and that solved it for us.<br>  <br>  It may also be dust in the room.  How often do you dust?  I hate doing it, but it has to be done.  It is quite nasty when you think about it.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, i urge you to see a specialist.

GJKsizL7aa	What do you mean by safe?  It won't fall off.  <br>  <br>  But, your glans and inner foreskin will dry out and keratinize, which will result in a loss of sensitivity.

FicyC2TXaa	As others have pointed out, there are a number of reasons why cancer APPEARS to be more common these days.<br>  <br>  The first is better general health care; in the west at least, more people are living well into old age than ever before. Many cancers are associated with ageing, so - more old people = more cases of cancer.<br>  <br>  With modern diagnostic techniques and screening., cancers that would not have been spotted in the past are now found through routine screening.<br>  <br>  And because of improved treatments, more people are surviving cancer for longer, so you are likely to meet more people who've had cancer than you would even 20 years ago.<br>  <br>  And of course we hear more about cancer these days in the media. When we didn't have TV or the internet cancer didn't get as much coverage as it does now. <br>  <br>  And people are more open about cancer, more willing to talk about it. When my dad got cancer in the 1950s, his mother was mortified because she associated cancer with dirt - I bet she didn't mention i to anybody she knew that her son had cancer, as someone in her position would these days<br>  <br>  You mention famous people getting cancer; in the past, even as recently as 20 years ago, very few people in the public eye would announce they had cancer, much less give interviews. Famous people, like other people, are more open and honest about cancer - and a good thing too. In the UK there's anecdotal evidence of huge increases in the numbers of young women going for and asking for cervical smears following the publicity surrounding Jade Goody's cancer.<br>  <br>  Cancer's been around as long as humankind and longer.<br>  <br>  The oldest description of cancer in humans was found in an Egyptian papyrus written between 3000-1500 BC. It referred to tumours of the breast.<br>  <br>  The oldest available specimen of a human cancer is found in the remains of skull of a female who lived during the Bronze Age (1900-1600 BC) The tumour in the woman's skull was suggestive of head and neck cancer<br>  <br>  I once read about a tumour discovered in the fossil remains of a dinosaur, but I haven't been able to find the reference again.<br>  <br>  Here are some articles about the history of cancer<br>  <br>  <a href="http://cancer.about.com/od/historyofcancer/a/cancerhistory.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cancer.about.com/od/historyofcanc...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerandresearch/learnaboutcancer/whatiscancer/historyofcancer/" rel="nofollow">http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancera...</a><br>  <br>  The origin of the word cancer is credited to the Greek physician Hippocrates (460-370 B.C.)|`|7eb3fd3226605d4f11ad285a2b5a5ab4aa	There are several reasons for your observations.<br>  <br>  People are living longer, so more chance of contracting cancer.<br>  <br>  In the past, it was often undiagnosed or diagnosed as something else.<br>  <br>  In our modern society we are exposed to more risk, electromagnetic radiation is everywhere, our diet is often rich in fat and calories but poor in anti-oxidants and fibre, we tend to be more sedentary, holes in ozone layer leave us with more UV exposure etc.|`|LQABiZcaaa	The truth is in USA and Europe, the number of cancer cases is decreasing and the survival is increasing.<br>  <br>  Cancer is a disease of age.   The older you get the likely you are to get a form of cancer.  Go back over deaths in the last 100 years and you see that there were many other causes of death the killed many young.  You also see it in the life expectancy.<br>  <br>  1900 -1905  the flu killed thousands,<br>  WWI and II millions of young soldiers killed<br>  We have cured many child diseases that killed millions in last 100 years.|`|Vrc13ExVaa	It's been around for ages, we just have better technology to detect it now. Some of it is on the rise.<br>  <br>  Some cancers have increased for reasons like pollution of the earth, but with medical advances some are expected to go on the decline.<br>  <br>  People hardly knew anything about it before the microscope was invented-- think about it. If you can't even see cells, how can you understand tumors, or cancer at all? <br>  <br>  Today we still don't know a whole lot about it.

Tc23KWgzaa	I don't think there's much you can do about the sweating, unless you want to apply an antiperspirant.  Do your shoes have good ventilation?  They should have mesh or air holes. Your socks need to be 100% cotton.  Wear sandals when you can.  For your smell, do you use an anti-bacterial soap?  My friend's baby was having smelly feet, so they brought lysol in a basin of water, soaked his feet, and it worked.  My sister works with herbal remedies, and the saying  goes, Feet Stink?  Take zinc.  Maybe bacterial?  Maybe fungal?  See a dr. if it continues.<br>  <br>  TX Mom|`|pyBHdJ90aa	Black tea.  Tanic acid will stop the sweat, but you have to keep doing this for a few days.

As an example I'll use my own medical history. I've been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder {a mental illness}, chronic infection with the Hepatitis C Virus {a blood borne viral disease}, and Basal Cell Carcinoma of the vulva {a malignant -cancerous- growth}.

The patch is better. You are right, the act of smoking is much worse than using a patch.|`|83fe3aa603aeb5f0a66147482fa68a47aa	Anything with nicotine, like gum or patches or cigarettes, are bad. Nicotine is the addictive substance in cigs, so they advise ppl to use patches or gum to rid their addiction to cigarettes but not to the drug itself.<br>  <br>  Nicotine is harmful. It damages the blood vessels and interupts with blood flow and pressure. That means it can affect the coronary arteries and cause heart diseases.|`|866080b9aca1fb5e68df6b076153bd50aa	Nicotene is very harmful..it is a powerful stimulant and chemical that affects the heart so it's not advisable to use patches long term.<br>  <br>  There are over 3000 harmful and carconagenic chemicals in one single ciggarette as well..So the tar is not the only harmful ingredient in a cigarette by far.
z4rmuK69aa	I am a doctor, i can rx anything I want,  Trust me, there is nothing   cool about OxyContin. It has caused more pain and suffering  then you can ever imagine.  Now, I lived through the 60's, that was cool.  Sorry I don't  know any cool facts about Oxycontin .|`|U3WgkkpHaa	It will make you look hilarious in front of many viewers.<br>  It will also make you want to roll on the ground for no apparent reason.<br>  <br>  HAHA ROFL ; )|`|YAoHtXSLaa	Commonly Known As: Oxy, Oxy’s, Oxies, Oxycotton, OC’s, Killers, Oceans, O’s, Oxycoffins.<br>  <br>  Access to Drug: By prescription, through dealers, parties, raves, friends, and the internet without prescription. It is illegal to possess Oxycontin without a prescription and arrests can be made for possession, sales, driving under the influence, and transporting the drug.<br>  <br>  Scientific Name: Oxycodone Hydrochloride controlled release. It is an opioid analgesic, central nervous system depressant that relieves pain for up to 12 hours and induces sleep. It is highly addictive.<br>  <br>  Interesting Facts: Oxycontin is rapidly becoming a wide spread problem in the United States. The drug was developed in the mid 1990’s from Oxycodone (Percoset) for time release extended pain management of chronic pain in dying cancer patients, and people suffering from around the clock chronic pain. Unfortunately, some patients prescribed Oxycontin and Oxycodone without proper instructions are finding themselves battling an addiction problem. Oxycontin abuse is also believed to be responsible for numerous deaths in adolescents, especially when combined with alcohol, and has contributed to an increase in crime in some communities. Purdue Pharmacies, which developed the drug, is currently exploring methods of creating a new form of Oxycontin which would include an opiate antagonist that would block the effects of the opiates if the pill is crushed.<br>  <br>  Methods of Use: Oxycontin is a pill that is taken orally. Abusers will use methods including chewing, crushing the pill and snorting the ingredients, or intravenously. Some will lick or rub off the time release coating on the pill prior to administration.<br>  <br>  Common Effects When Intoxicated: Euphoria, dry mouth, motor impairment, impaired judgment, hallucinations, impaired gait, pin point pupils, slurred speech, nausea, and sedation. The effects are reported to be similar to Heroin but with worse consequences.<br>  <br>  Duration of Intoxication: When taken as prescribed, the effects last approximately 12 hours. However, crushing or chewing a pill immediately releases all the narcotics into the system instead of over time and the effects can be felt for about four to six hours followed by intense cravings. Overdoses are common due to people not realizing that even half a pill when crushed can lower the respiratory system enough to cause coma or death.<br>  <br>  Withdrawal: The intensity of the withdrawal depends on the amount of drug used and the duration of abuse. It is more intense than Heroin withdrawal and includes flu-like symptoms with body and muscle aches, itchy skin, inability to concentrate, sleep disturbance, amotivation, headaches, nausea, and hot and cold flashes. Regular abusers/addicts require cessation therapy in a medical facility. However, cravings combined with the extremely uncomfortable withdrawal often lead to relapse.<br>  <br>  Effects of Long Term Use: Because Oxycontin is still relatively new, long term effects have not been documented. It is estimated that like Heroin addicts, the longer the use or abuse, the more intense the cravings as well as an increased need for more of the drug to reach the desired effects. Weight loss/anorexia, amotivation, brain dysfunction and other symptoms common to long term use of opiate drugs can be expected.<br>  <br>  Abuse, Dependence, and Addiction: Oxycontin is highly addictive both physically and psychologically. The body quickly adapts to the narcotics in the brain and muscle tissue while psychologically, users will crave the euphoric feelings created by the drug. Treatment is required in a supportive, medical environment in order to aid in the withdrawal process as well as make changes in behavior that was adopted in order to maintain the addiction. “Doctor hopping” is common with Oxycontin abusers as well as the development of psycho-somatic symptoms.<br>  <br>  Associated Risks: Users of Oxycontin can experience any number of traumas due to the cessation of pain, physically and emotionally. Car accidents, suicide, overdose, seizures and death can result especially if Oxycontin is used in combination with alcohol, tranquilizers, hypnotics, and other central nervous system depressants. With addiction, abusers will often resort to crime to maintain their drug use.

Another possibility is that you have an under active thyroid in which case you will have cold skin, tiredness, and weight gain. You can also have weight gain with depression.

The first symptom was when she flew out of her bedroom window - luckily her father's car broke her fall. <br>  <br>  She spent many years in and out of various mental units but did manage to go back to complete her education - she had been at the start of her final year of A levels on the occasion of the flight.  Even managed a degree despite another break down during second year exams. <br>  <br>  Amy gave birth, despite advise to the contrary, to a baby boy who sadly was taken away some months later for adoption.  The father, like yourself, enjoys experimenting and proved to be more violent than supportive (the drugs made him that way).. <br>  <br>  We don't care what happens to the father, Amy is doing OK although she will never be able to hold down a job and will have to rely on benefits for the rest of her life..   The little one is happy with adoptive parents.  <br>  <br>  All in all; I'm sorry but I would be stupid not to say it - Please give up drugs now.

Don't you think that maybe she had a predisposition for whatever mental problem she developed? And I'll bet that before she had that "deadly" toke, she showed signs of whatever she has now.

But there is a website: www.erowid.com that provides detailed, objective information about drugs. Perhaps you can find an answer there.|`|IERF9IjJaa	The answer to this question depends highly on the dosage, what other medications you might be taking, factors such as preexisting or family history of certain kinds of mental illness (especially schizophrenia) and the fitness of your brain to begin with. Hallucinogens, like other dissociatives, are believed to agonize (increase) levels in the brain of an excitatory neurotransmittor known as Glutamate. Glutamate, at any level is neurotoxic, it damages brain cells. However, at low doses it is usually accepted that Hallucinogens are unlikely to have a permanent effect. At higher doses however, it is proven that hallucinogens, as well as any other substance agonizing glutamate will not only damage neurons but that it will cause lesions (holes if you will) in the brian. Fear not, regular recreational doses used sparingly and infrequently are unlikely to have this effect, but given the fact that doses of street hallucinogens are difficult to predict (you may get far more LSD than you bargained for as LSD doses are measured in micrograms and tend to fluctuate), you are best avoiding LSD if you wish to maintain cognitive functioning. Opinions vary on how to LIMIT damage to the brain but some theories have included taking various substances AFTER one trips that reverse or mitigate the effects of lsd directly in the synapses. This would include many drugs that affect serotonin, as LSD is a non-specific seratonergic agonist, although its effects are most prominent at the 5ht-2a subtype. Therefore drugs which have an antagonistic effects at similar binding sites of serotonin receptors, such as the atypical antipsychotics (seroquel, risperdal, geodon) and SSRI's (Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Lexapro) might limit the after-effects and long-term effects of hallucinogen use. This has not been proven however and so at best, with the current state of neurological research, use your drugs  carefully, and caveat emptor.

pqnEavSyaa	Shin splints is a painful condition in the shin involving inflammation that occurs either in the front or inside section of the shin bone. In many cases, shin splints can result from intense physical activity such as running or jumping, and is a condition that can often take a long time to heal. <br>  <br>  The symptoms for shin splints include tightness and/or tenderness around the shin, especially after running or walking for long distances. Shin splints are generally caused by excessive stretching of muscles and tendons along the shin bones (tibia and fibula). Overuse of these muscles by athletes and runners is the most common factor.  Excessive pronation of the feet can also be a major contributing factor. Over-pronation leads to internal tibial rotation and increases the tractional forces upon the muscles and ligaments in the lower leg.<br>  <br>  In the short term, rest is required to help alleviate shin pain; running and other strenuous activities should be avoided until the condition is minimized. Shin Splints can frequently be prevented by warming up before intense physical activity.<br>  <br>  Using appropriate footwear is also a good way to prevent and reduce the effect of shin splints, especially for runners who strike heavily with the heel. Running shoes with proper rear foot stability are important. Orthotic insoles are useful in that they help prevent over-pronation and provide heel cushioning to reduce impact while providing heel stability.<br>  <br>  Please refer to link below for more information.|`|JwecpnBVaa	Shin splints are what you are developing.  Before you run and after you need to ice, by icing I mean sticking your leg in a bucket of ice water.  Also tape it before you run.  Have an expert (this is what my track coach had me do last season) watch how you run, there could be a problem with your feet that is causing the pain.  My feet would turn in when I stepped down which created pressure on my shins, all I had to do was buy a new pair of shoes that were made for my condition and I was better.<br>  <br>  If you don't do anything this could start a major problem, so be sure to treat it!|`|zNnW2TxHaa	Just means your over-working your shins. They'll eventually adjust. If it has been absolutely unbearable, take it down a notch and work your way back up. Make sure your form is on key as well. Think straight lines, and try to relax while walking (unless youre working your core- keeping your butt and abs tight) But this pain is common when first starting a cardio work out.|`|S9mUA5IVaa	What works for me is actually raising the incline, my foot hits the treadmill at a different angle and some how it help with that.

16vMIGPiaa	Yes, more time in bed can make things worse not better.  It's possible to get too much sleep; it trains the body to be asleep instead of alert and awake.<br>  <br>  You need to put some effort into studying your sleep patterns - how many hours do you actually need to be physically rested?  Are you dreaming when you wake up, or struggling to consciousness when the alarm rings?  Waking from a dream is good.<br>  <br>  Do you snore?  (get some objective data on this one, don't pop off an outraged "I DON'T SNORE!").
