So you should be able to find a job somewhere<br>  try calling the stores or contacting them some way|`|lJbLxz39aa	Do you really talk like that? It sounds very immature.|`|dh8QUfywaa	16 is the legal age for work, but some of the places that you've mentioned prefer slightly older due to maturity.<br>  <br>  You would do better in the long run at a store like Rite-Aid compared to FootLocker.  Rite-Aid has more opportunity for advancement because there are more duties to tend to and more departments to work in.<br>  <br>  If you are 16 and wish to work at a more mature place such as Rite-Aid, you must 1st dress the part.  No baggy and saggy clothes. No piercings and nothing that could be seen as "Gangsta" no matter how much it cost or how nice you think it is.<br>  <br>  Maturity will be assumed based on how you are dressed and how you speak.  Use complete sentences and avoid using slang or expressions at all costs.<br>  <br>  Standard dress would be:<br>  1. Dress Slacks<br>  2. Button Down Shirt<br>  3. Tie<br>  4. No Cologne or Perfume<br>  5. Simple Hair -- High Maintenance Hair = High Maintenance Personality<br>  6. Go conservative on the make-up -- Especially if you are a guy.<br>  7. No Tennis Shoes -- Dress Shoes Only!<br>  <br>  Target prefers 18 years old or older and does not offer most employees enough hours in the course of a week.  Some stores will skip a week for scheduling an employee.  I do not recommend Target.<br>  <br>  Remember Speech and Presentation and tell the manager, you are interested in working for their store because you are looking for the best experience to add to your resume.  Tell them you have initiative and motivation and that your personality is if you see something that needs to be done, you do it rather than waiting to be told to do it.  That statement alone will increase your chances of being hired anywhere.<br>  <br>  One last thing. Instead of saying Do You Got say Do You Have<br>  Change the word got to the word have in your vocabulary.  It sounds gentler and more sophisticated.  The same goes for the word Want.  Instead of saying "Do you want" say "Would you like".  Would you like a drink?  How old do you have to be to work at a store?  Instead of saying "Can I do..."  use the word "May".  <br>  <br>  Go get 'em and Good Luck.|`|AA11478827	Depends on the State Law you live in and the Company policy of the company in which you wish to apply. I know most states require people under the age of 15 to apply for a work permit and so forth,.
