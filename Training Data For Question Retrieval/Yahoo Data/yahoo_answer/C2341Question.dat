20070530125101AAixmNM	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Admissions to a semi-adequate university?	I want to dual major in English and Architecture. The problem is my GPA. I bombed my ninth grade year but I've gotten straight A's the last 2 years (I am an enrolling senior). I received a 1220 on my SAT (I am going to retake it; CR: 640 MTH:580; WRT: 680). My GPA is 3.232 and I am in the process of online classes and summer courses. Don't get me wrong, I'm an Honors student and I am on the Varsity Swimming and Tennis team, so I am not totally dumb-witted. I am an All-County Saxophonist, an aspiring All-State player, and I'm in numerous clubs. I received a 2 (failing, I know) on my AP European History exam and a 4 on my AP English Language one. Is there any chance, if I continue with straight A's and these Honors and AP classes, for me to get accepted into an "okay" university? (Preferably, at this point, FIU) I think it is necessary to know that I am of African American and Asian descent (50/50). I am not usually one to trail on about this sort of thing, but comfort is always welco

Ich arbeite im IT-Bereich (Fachinformatiker) und m?chte unbedingt IT-Sicherheit studieren. Zwar bieten das eine ganze Reihe Unis in Deutschland als Spezialisierungsrichtung im Informatikstudium an, aber ich will meinen recht gut bezahlten Job auf keinen Fall aufgeben, also bleibt nur ein Fernstudium als M?glichkeit. Leider gibt es aber in Deutschland nur ein einziges Fernstudium im Bereich IT-Sicherheit, und das ist ein Zusatzstudium (Master), aber ich habe noch keinen Bachelor, kann damit also wenig anfangen. In den USA gibt es aber viele Fernstudieng?nge in dem Bereich, auch auf Bachelor-Ebene, nur werden die hier in Deutschland auch anerkannt? Mu? ich vielleicht was bei der Auswahl des Studiengangs beachten, damit es anerkannt wird, und wo mu? ich das Studium in Deutschland eigentlich anerkennen lassen?

20081029102935AATJVEs	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Personal statement for college?	i got a preferred application to the college i want to go to, so i didnt have to pay the fee, write an essay or any of that stuff, i just had to fill out the app. and send in my transcripts. well, i got a phonecall last night from a lady at the college, and she said since im applying for the nursing program, i have to write an essay on why it is i want to go into nursing. this is the personal statement i wrote for my senior english class, and i was hoping i could get some opinion on if i should use this or not.....         No less than 24 hours before receiving the news, I was sitting on a beach in Florida, having the time of my life. All of that came to a screeching halt with a phone call from my sister. She called to inform my mom that my brother was in the hospital, in a coma.    “Megan, Eric died this afternoon”; words that will forever be burned into my memory, like a bad song that you just cant seem to get out of your head. I never would have expected to hear my mother tell me that my brother, my best friend, was gone. I would never again get to jump on him to wake him up in the morning, go out to lunch with him, or just sit and have a conversation with him again.  It was as if the world around me stopped. “How could this happen, he’s Eric, he’s superman. How could he be dead?”   The days following my brother’s death were a blur. It was a mix of family, friends, food, cards and well wishes. The part I remember the most though, were the tears.  At ten years old, it was hard for me to grasp the fact that I was never again going to see my big brother.  The days passed, and dealing with his death slowly became easier, but there was always an empty place in my heart, where my brother once was. It’s hard to believe it’s been seven years since I saw him last, but its amazing to look back on my life, and see how much stronger of a person I’ve become. Through all of the trials and tribulations I’ve been faced with, I’ve gone into all of them with the same attitude. “If I can get through the death of my brother, I can get through anything”. To this day, I still think about how he would react to the choices I’m making in my life, and that plays a huge role in my day to day decisions. . Tomorrow isn’t promised to anyone, so if I’ve learned anything through this experience, it is that life can end at any moment, so it’s best to live life to its fullest, and work as hard as I can to do the best that I can, in all aspects of life. It has also taught me to be a much more caring, whole-hearted person, and I believe that becoming a nurse would be the best way to share that way of life with others.   Luckily, I’ve been able to turn a bad experience into a learning tool for my future. This experience not only forced me to mature, and learn to handle things at a young age, it also gave me an idea of where I would like my future to be headed. I’ve always considered going into the medical field, and after the passing of my brother, I began to realize how much I would enjoy being able to help people. I would love to be able to assist people who are going through similar situations, and I know that my brother would be happy to know that his death has made a positive influence on my goals for the future. Although I can’t bring my brother back, by becoming a nurse, I hope to offer support and comfort to the patients and families of those whom I encounter.

Can someone see if there are obvious errors such as apostrophes, commas, etc.?      Dear Mr.  Ravitt:      I have been an Acer customer for three years and have purchased various computers. My experience with the Acer products has been a pleasant one, and I especially love the Acer Aspire series. My latest purchase however, has not fulfilled my expectations as with previous purchases.      The computer I have been having difficulties with is the Acer Aspire T3200, which I purchased seven months ago from Best Buy. My computer started having problems about three months ago so I took the computer to a Best Buy technician where they had apparently resolved the problem. Two weeks later, the screen began fading away to the point where the images were hardly visible. I had to return to the technicians where they told me that they could not fix this problem, only the manufacturer could. A month later I received the computer, where it worked for only five days. Now, the computer doesn’t even turn on.      I feel I have exhausted my options to repair this computer. I love the computer model and would want to continue using it. A replacement under these conditions would be acceptable, since the computer has failed to be repaired twice. I hope that this issue will be solved so I can continue using your great products.

20080331211048AAVrNi1	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Should I let my teacher and classmates in on my human calculator math skills?	I'm in 10th grade and currently taking Algebra 2.      Basically.. I can divide a two digit number by a one digit number completely, reciting all the decimals very quickly.      If you pick a number and square it, I could give you the square root instantly. If you pick a number and multiply it by itself 3 times, I could give you that number instantly as well. I can do percentages in my head. (like what's 28 percent of 48) I can also race against the calculator by adding a 2 digit number on itself over and over again. A lot more too...      People are gonna think I think I'm some **** bragging on the internet but I'm really not. I'm as honest as possible. I've always hidden my talent from everyone because I fear people will call me a FREAK and view me differently if they find out.      Also, what if my math teacher gets mad that I'm trying to show off and impressing people instead of him when that's his job? Is it common for math teachers to have those skills?      What do you think I should do?
20090304063040AA5K1jP	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Are there any mistakes in this english topic?	My favourite band is “Alesana”. They play punk music but they’re not very famous. They are American and the band is composed by 6 boys. The band has been complete since 2004 when they make them first tour. In addicted of internet, they were known by many European and Australian teenagers. Infect I knew them last year while I was surfing the web and I listened to their songs while I was watching a personal blog of a girl. The name “Alesana” derives from Alice-Ann Street in Baltimore, the place where the singer wrote his first songs.       Their best song for me called “Early morning” and it talks about a night when a boy missed his girlfriend. In this song there aren’t basses, guitars or drums but there are only the piano and the voice of Dennis Lee, the singer. Other songs as “Apology” and “Nero’s Decay” instead talk about nights of love or death like all the other songs.      I like them because it is an unusual band. The best thing of this band is the voice of Dennis Lee. There are different parts in their songs. In some parts the singer sings with a lovely voice, but in other parts the singer uses a growl voice making the song more interesting. They have an unusual style. They always dress in black and smooth their hair too.       The best cd for me is first called “Try this with your eyes closed”. Here there are 13 tracks including “early morning”. On June they’ll present their new cd called “when myth fades to legend”.      Recently they are giving some concerts in the USA, Japan and Australia, And in June they will be in Italy in Milan at the “Zoe-Club” but I can’t go there because my parents aren’t agree, but if I find someone known by my parents take me there maybe they let me go.         can you say me them? have you got any recommendation or criticals? Help me!!

20090227022943AA3ZvKJ	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Homework halp!!!!! thnk you?	can someone write me a book report from this? i needs to be a page or a page and a half thanks so much ^_^ is due tommorow             Number the Stars is told from the point of view of ten-year-old Annemarie Johansen. The story is set in the city of Copenhagen, Denmark in September 1943, the third year of the Nazi occupation of Denmark. Annemarie and her best friend Ellen, who is Jewish, are stopped by soldiers on their way home from school. The two girls, who go to the same school and live in the same building, are unsettled by their first direct encounter with the Germans. Mrs. Johansen and Mrs. Rosen are concerned and ask the girls to take a new route to school. The encounter makes Annemarie reflect on what her father has taught her about Denmark and also about her older sister Lise's death a few years before the start of the novel. Later in the fall, Annemarie and her younger sister Kirsti discover that Mrs. Hirsch's neighborhood shop has been closed. This event further alarms Mrs. Johansen, though Annemarie does not understand why.       During a late night visit from Peter Neilsen, a member of the Resistance and the man Lise was to marry, Annemarie is told more about the war. Her parents and Peter explain that Jewish stores are being closed. The next day, the Rosens must flee. They leave Ellen with the Johansens. During the night, German soldiers come to the apartment demanding that Mr. Johansen disclose the location of his friends. He refuses and they search the apartment. Ellen pretends to be one of the Johansen's daughters, but her dark hair causes the solider to be suspicious. Luckily, Mr. Johansen is able to show them a baby picture of Lise with dark hair, which convinces the soldiers.       The next day, Mrs. Johansen takes the three girls to her brother Henrik's home in Gilleleje, Denmark, where Henrik is a fisherman. They spend a peaceful day in the house by the ocean before Henrik announces that their Great-aunt Birte has died. The service is to be held that evening. Annemarie knows that no such aunt exists, and demands the truth. Uncle Henrik explains the importance of not knowing too much when bravery is needed. That night the coffin arrives and they gather around it. Many more people arrive, but all are silent. Soon Peter appears with the Rosens, who are reunited with Ellen. Soldiers, drawn by the post-curfew lights, come to the house. They demand that the coffin be opened, a problem since the coffin is empty. Mrs. Johansen thinks quickly and says that her aunt died of highly contagious typhus. The soldiers leave.       Henrik takes the first group of people down to his boat. Mrs. Johansen follows with the Rosens. Annemarie, who now understands that the people are being taken to safety in Sweden, awaits her mother's safe return. When her mother does not appear, she discovers that Mrs. Johansen has broken her ankle. Because of this, Annemarie must take an important package to her uncle before they can leave. On the way to the boat, soldiers with dogs stop her. They search her basket and discover the package. But when they rip it open it contains only a handkerchief, and they let her go. Annemarie makes it to the boat in time, to Henrik's evident relief.       That evening, Henrik is safe at home having dinner with Annemarie, Kirsti, and Mrs. Johansen, whose ankle has been taken care of by the local doctor. After dinner, Uncle Henrik takes Annemarie to learn how to milk the cow. They talk about the events of the day. He explains that he hid his passengers in the bottom of the boat, and the handkerchief was essential because it kept the Germans' dogs from smelling the human cargo. Uncle Henrik praises Annemarie for her bravery and reassures her that Ellen is safe and they will meet again someday.       The war ends in May, and Annemarie and her family watch from their balcony as people parade in the streets with the Danish flag. Annemarie thinks of the Rosens and realizes that they, along with all the others who were forced to flee, will soon be returning home. Peter Nielsen has died. He was shot in a public square for his involvement in the Resistance. Annemarie's parents tell her that Lise was a member of the Resistance, too, and that she did not die in an accident, but was killed by the Germans. Thinking of Lise and of Ellen, Annemarie goes to the trunk of Lise's things in her room and takes out the Star of David pendant that she has been keeping for Ellen. She says she will wear the necklace herself until Ellen returns.

20081022150603AApT8dK	Education & Reference;Homework Help	*best answer given* Help on this paragraph?	 Once you are forced to live with a sibling you are bound to share a few touching memories together. I remember him and I skateboarding down to 7-11 almost everyday. On Fridays we would take our allowances with us and splurge on slushies and gummy bears. Then we would race home on a sugar rush. Unless it was raining outside then we would learn songs. We tried to learn as many songs as possible. Both he and I were musically inclined therefore we easily learned the lyrics to our favorite pop, alternative and hip hop songs. Once a new song was learned then our lucky house members got to listen to us sing on the top of our lungs for hours. But the place that beat out any sugar rush or song memory is our stop sign. About a street away from our house was an old rusted stop sign. Whenever he or I needed to work out our problems we went there together. Sometimes we didn’t have a solution to anything but that was okay. He would just sit there in my lap and place his hand in mine giving both of us the feeling of reassurance/relief. And to me that feeling couldn’t beat anything else that was given to me in the world.         any suggestions ideas feel free to tell me what to reword

20090305055833AAvyQqc	Education & Reference;Home Schooling	Home schooling 5 year olds questions regarding Hooked on Phonics...?	I'm currently home schooling my 5 year old twin boys on a kindergarten level.       I'm using hooked on phonics - the yellow (kindergarten) level for teaching them reading. It's actually got a really great system for it and starts out with "an" words like (man, can, tan, ran, pan) then goes to "at" words (mat, cat, sat, rat, fat) and teaches them in word groups like that how to spell and read it. The problem I'm having is that one of my twins digs it and does really with it. The other one on the other hand, not so much. I know he knows it because I go over things with him and make him sound out words for me at random and he does, and he reads it along with the CD and I show him the flash cards of the letters and make him go through all the letter sounds. But he just won't read the little stories and tells me he doesn't know the words, which isn't true. I know he knows them. My stepdad thinks that he (the twin I'm having a problem with) is just too smart for the hooked on phonics lesson plans and that he's bored with it and needs more stimulation. I considered this a possibility because I know not everyone learns the same way, and maybe he just has a different learning style.      So my questions are: Has anyone used Hooked on Phonics and what was your experience with it? Also, what other methods do you recommend for teaching beginners reading? What has worked best in your experience and what has not worked well for you?

20090227034119AAdIBNo	Education & Reference;Other - Education	From A Foreign English Speaker--- asking for revision?	English is not our mother tongue. Although having learned English for a long time, I still haven't been to English-speaking countries. My daughter is going to have a English-speaking contest in her school. She wrote a script about describing a dream for the contest, and ask me to revise it for her. I am afraid that I used too many uncommon words for a G5 kid and  inappropiate usage, or made some grammatical mistakes.       Asking for opinion of revision from university students or anyone good in English.      The following is her script.      --------------------------------------...      Good afternoon, teachers and schoolmates!       Today I would like to share a story of mine with you.       It was a sunny afternoon. My family and I rode bicycles together very happily. We saw and entered a castle with special pictures on the walls. It seemed that there were many stories in these pictures. There were many kinds of colorful fish in the lake of the castle and beside the lake were also colorful flowers and trees. The scenes of the castle were so strange that I thought there must be something wrong, and most of all, there was not any person.       After leaving the castle, I saw a forest where many animals lived. Suddenly a rhinoceros rushed toward us. I was scared by the roar and the rumbling of its steps, so we left in a hurry. Being sure that we were out of danger, I lay on a grassy lawn in the breeze. It was a very wonderful feeling enjoying the breeze on the lawn.      When we rode again, my brother and I were chasing each other. I rode faster, faster and faster. Then I felt that I became lighter, lighter and lighter. I was flying up in the sky! I could see higher and farther! I enjoyed viewing the beautiful green landscape, breathing the crisp fresh air and listening to the happy chirps of little birds.      Then I saw a splendid outstanding building. Wow! It was the famous Taipei 101 ! I had ridden from the country to the metropolis. In the meantime, however, the landscape was transforming! The tall green trees became tall buildings. The sweet scent of flowers became the foul odor of sewage. The happy chirps of birds became noises from the factories. The bright blue sky became dirty gray because of the automobile exhaust.      I felt that the air was running out! I could not breathe any more!      I shouted “Mother, Father and younger brother, where are you!”      Then I woke up. Oh! Oh! It was a dream, and my face was covered by a blanket! I could breathe again.      Although it was a dream, it gives me an inspiration: “we have only one Earth, and we have to protect it very well!”         Thanks for your listening!      --------------------------------------...

20090305063917AAnCxsH	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Please Check This Paragraph!!?	This is an intro to research paper on The Rockefeller Foundation      During the late 19th century to early 20th century, large companies and monopolies controlled the American economy and many workers suffered from low wages and horrible working conditions.  During this time, John D. Rockefeller revolutionized the petroleum industry and quickly became the richest man in the world.  But as his wealth grew, his desire to help others in need also increased.  After Rockefeller read The Gospel of Wealth written by Andrew Carnegie in 1889, which stated the idea of the rich helping others without reward, he wrote a letter to Carnegie: “I would that more men of wealth were doing as you are doing with your money but, be assured, your example will bear fruits and the time will come when men of wealth will more generally be willing to use it for the good of others.” (qtd. in Nauffts 1).   Not long after, Rockefeller began his quest to destroy the underlying source of human suffering.  After making countless contributions and donations for many years, he officially created the Rockefeller Foundation in 1913.  Since then, The Rockefeller Foundation used the force of globalization to expand their reach to help vulnerable communities around the world.  With assets of more than 4 billion dollars, The Rockefeller Foundation stands as one of the biggest non-profit organization in the world.

Because of all work that the board did, spellings like ax (instead of axe) and program (instead of programme) had become acceptable in American English.(11)        The listening passage explain why the work of the Simplified Spelling Board does not last.According to the listening passage, the main reason for the board's problems were that it went too far.They tried to establish spellings like yu (instead of you) and tuff (instead of tough). There was a real negative reaction to the attempt to change spelling too much, and eventually the board was dissolving. (6)

At that age I did not have to wear school uniform as our primary school did not have one. Them when I was seven our primary school came up with the idea that we should have to wear a uniform. So I had to wear a grey skirt, with a green top which had our school logo on and a plain white t-shirt. Them when I went to secondary school I had to wear a blue or white blouses, grey or blue jumper or cardigan and a grey or blue skirt with a smart pair of shoes.      The reason I ask why the US have to wear uniform is because I have watched films that are from the US but for some reason they never seem to have uniform on.
