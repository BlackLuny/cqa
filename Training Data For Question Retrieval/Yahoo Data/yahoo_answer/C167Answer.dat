STfDkQTyaa	Una vez investigamos en el colegio este tema cuando era adolescente. Varias mamás se llevaban a sus fetitos en frascos, envueltas en culpas y reproches que las marcaría de por vida. Otras veces, los dejaban en frascos para algún estudio. Lamentablemente la mayoría de las veces, las mamás que no hicieron nada por sus vidas, no hicieron nada por sus cuerpos muertos, y para el hospital, esta criatura es un desecho más y sigue la misma suerte. Hay como hogueras en el fondo de cada hospital donde se queman estos "desechos". Es escalofriante a veces escuchar cómo puede una madre matar a su hijo por nacer. Cómo puede alguien justificar el aborto? No me entra en la cabeza. Es todo muy triste pero es así.|`|pNbc1ch9aa	La verdad cuando es un aborto provocado no se que se haga, pero cuando es un aborto quirugico necesario, antes de los tres meses se examina para ver el por que del aborto, si es despues de los tres meses ya no se puede esto y te lo dan como bebe muerto, lo tienes que registrar y primero se examina el caso, ya sabes llega la semefo y todo, es bastante traumatico, a mi hermana le paso, el unico consuelo que le queda es que ahora su bebito esta con nosotros al lado de mi abuelita, (tenemos las dos urnas con sus cenizas juntos) creo que eso le ayudo a superar su perdida por que tampoco queria que se quedara en el seguro y que le hicieran quien sabe que tantas cosas|`|rmdoYLNHaa	Se conservan para algún estudio o generalmente son deshechados como residuos hospitalarios y puestos en la basura.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	En los hospitales les preguntan a las madres si quieren el feto o no. Si dicen que no, son donados al anfiteatro del hospital para estudiarlos.

A MI NO ME GUSTA. <br>  Genoveva, nombre femenino de origen incierto; algunos autores le atribuyen origen Gales "Gwenhuifar", que significa "Aquella que es blanca como la espuma del mar" y otros le atribuyen origen Celta, su significado es "Aquella que es de origen noble o de buena casta"<br>  Historia y el Santo: <br>  Santa Genoveva, virgen. Nació en Nanterre, Francia en el a?o 422; desde muy joven sintió el llamado del Se?or y junto a otras mujeres funda una asociación para dedicarse a la vida religiosa y ayudar a los pobres. Durante el a?o 451 se pronostica la amenaza de Atila (la invasión de los hunos); los habitantes de Paris atemorizados desean huir y Santa Genoveva les calma y anuncia que si se quedan y oran no les pasara nada. Atila nunca llega a Paris y se dice que ella salvo Paris mediante sus oraciones. Según la leyenda Santa Genoveva convierte al cristianismo a Clodoveo I y a través de él a todo Francia. Patrona de Paris y de Francia, es convocada contra los problemas oculares, contra la lepra y la peste. Su santo se celebra el 03 de enero. <br>  Genoveva en otros idiomas, catalán: Genoveva; francés: Genevieve (acento frances en vie); ingles: Guenevere; italiano: Genoveffa|`|acc3549d0852dccdc860dc34c017f709aa	esta bien|`|fc43ea2cb9e88853283224580bf2bb7daa	pues la verdad ami no me gusta pues en mi opinion es mejor giovana que geneoveva que no bueno no se es tu gusto yo solo doy mi opinion ....|`|1Mg3y5ZQaa	ese nombre definitivamente no pega, a menos que no estes en alemania. creo que a una ni?a no deben ponerle ese nombre, es un nombre para personas mayores, jaja.|`|Ro4zVqvJaa	nose a lo que te refieres pero el nombre no esta mal.<br>  besazos|`|XwiFdXLhaa	como que no beba .jaja|`|gStfn3Azaa	quien es genoveva???

QNnRVUoiaa	I'm sure she'll be mad if you tell your mom or her mom. but that's the right thing to do. go right ahead and tell your mom and her mom everything you just told us. your cousin is far off the limits. dont be afraid.|`|xbgCwmbdaa	I think that these are things that need to be brought to someones attention. If you want to tell your mom but don't want her to know that you told her, type up a letter (or have someone else do it who will come across as someone older) and put it in your mailbox or even her mothers mail box. <br>  <br>  Some secrets are OK to keep, while others could hurt the person you are keeping them for. On one hand you want her to trust you so she wont start keeping what she's doing from you - and on the other, she could develop a serious problem, end up in trouble and on probation, or worse if you don't tell anyone. You have to figure out which is more important.|`|2QvIM81Haa	Well, you should tell your mom. Find out the next time your cousin is going to sneak out and then have your mom and / or her mom follow her until she is there and watch her. Then when the time is right, the mom's will come out and catch her in the act. That way, she has no idea it was you who told and she gets caught and will hopefully stop. :D|`|egqveuPjaa	Listen, if it's just beer I wouldn't be worried, I know A LOT of people who've been drinking cans since they were 11.

She is playing with fire, and her parents need to know!  She'll be mad at you, but she has to be alive to be mad, and the way she's going she might not be for long unless she straightens out.  She'll forgive you eventually, when she gets her head on straight.  She knows (when she's capable of thinking) that you love her.<br>  <br>  Only 13 and already can't remember how much she drinks is a very bad sign.<br>  <br>  Her parents can't help her with a problem they don't know about.

WBqyCECaaa	Mi hija tuvo esa afeccion... el medico vivia diciendome que se le iba a ir a los seis meses cuando madurara el lagrimal (pues tiene una nariz muy chiquita) Yo no le crei ay tenia la misma sensacion que vos... "es normal, es comun"...  (era mas propenso de un ojito)...  de todas manera la primera vez lo tratamos con unos antibioticos, para descartar la infeccion... pero le mejoro mientras le poniamos unas gotitas y despues volvio... entonces el medico me dijo es falta de maduracion del lagrimal...<br>  Y te cuento algo? .... despues de los seis meses se le fue.... solo .... lo unico que hice durante esos seis mese fue limpirle el ojito con una gasa con  con te, con leche materna , o con solucion fisiologica... para que no se le irritara.<br>  <br>  De todas maneras este es un ejemplo para tranquilizarte un poco de que aveces "es normal , es comun" y vivimos aterrorizados con que le pueda pasar algo... me paso... <br>  <br>  Pero el medico esta tambien para hacer ese trabajo... tranquilizarnos... asi que la consulta al medico debe incluir la revisacion del ni?o y la satisfaccion de los padres a todas las preguntas... asi que a preguntar...|`|0Vpn7y37aa	tienes que tener cuidado y si continua seria bueno que lo vuelvas a ver un medico.puede tener una infeccion y por eso si no se trata bien le va a volver.|`|92b3ea1a28f341b06d6f18282bedd813aa	Es el aire, pero enjuagalo bien con aguita y se le quita.

Uno para cada ojito. Mi hijo se despertaba de dormir con los ojitos pegados de las laga?as que tenía...Me dieron unas gotitas llamadas gotabiotic (que tiene tobramicina y otras cosas más). Las gotitas se las dí un tiempo..no me acuerdo cuanto...pero lavarle los ojitos tuve que hacerlo hasta casi los 4 meses...después se le pasó todo. Consultá con un oftalmólogo para ni?os. Yo hice eso, porque mi pediatra, también me decía que era normal.. Eso ..te vas a cansar de escucharlo....La oftalmóloga me había dicho que aparte de la maduración del lagrimal, es muy común la conjuntivitis en el recién nacido, por eso me dió esas gotas.<br>  Y tu hermana...debe ser alérgica...que vaya a algún neumonólogo, inmunólogo o médico especializado en alergias, y que le diga que está amamantando..para ver que puede tomar.

(Nota la "n" que ubica despues de la "a" y antes de la consonante "d".  Ahi esta lo musical).  <br>  <br>  Deysi no me parece que vaya de la mano con "Alejandra".  Como que falta coyuntura, conjuncion entre ambos nombres.  Deysi ("daisy" -- "i" latina primero y "y" griega al final-- es la palabra en ingles para la flor "margarita") y se usa como nombre en ingles {Daisy} tal y como usamos el "Margarita" en espaniol.  Pero. . . no se.  Como que no hay eso que no es definible pero que es lo que hace que una combinacion de dos nombres agrade al oido.  El "Alejandra" es genial.

2ZXh00C5aa	rather low. If he urinated prior to his sexual encounter with your friend and after his last ejaculation, the chance is almost non-existent.|`|yFYFSjwcaa	Pre-***<br>  <br>  Yes she can get pregnant the chance is even higher that she didn't use a condom.|`|EE7sAaMlaa	its not 50/50 because even if he did ejaculate it doesnt mean that shes 100% gonna be pregnant! i still wouldnt say its likely to be honest i mean people always freak out bout it because of course its possible but it happens and most married couples dont worry if they had sex once without a condom and they dont want to get pregnant, because its just not that likely!|`|SpYS7VYoaa	50/50|`|p3d3E75oaa	50% either way|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	Ermm... Pretty high. For cr@p's sake how hard is it to use a freaking condom?|`|VVDzHiROaa	there is a 50/50 chance. granite he didn't ejaculate, there is also sperm in the pre-ejaculation juice :)|`|03cd64db97799ad453f75f436a0f4b73aa	50/50. There is less of a chance she is pregnant because he didnt ejaculate, but there is still a good shot|`|lTsPX04jaa	there is a good chance
0Kw2yVp4aa	do something really bad lol no maybe just talk to her|`|EfiIrH1Jaa	talk to her, tell her how u feel.  all mothers love all their children the same.  just talk to her.  she loves u, she just may not love the things u do.  and she does notice dont worry!

BUOJJpaCaa	While you're having sex, play with your clitoris. It will help, really.<br>  <br>  Some woman just can't orgasm.  Try different positions or toys.|`|kIad9ffRaa	If your not married don't have sex!
4ahUadqxaa	Everyone masturbates.|`|kIad9ffRaa	Most don't know how.
oP504BtFaa	I hate when my girls will drag out words in perfectly normal conversations. Likee when they're tryingg to tell me somethingg it just takes foreverr because occasionallyy they think it's cuteee to talk in the form of a questionn? SO irritating. They seem to be growing out of this though - yippee!|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	Chase will stand on the couch and yell, "Sit down now!"  Or he'll beg and beg for more juice, milk or water.  He just drinks and drinks and it's annoying to keep refilling the cup every five minutes.<br>  <br>  Mason's only five months, but sometimes he screams.  Not like upset, crying screaming, but just to hear himself happy screaming.  It gets annoying after a while.|`|YBQvzEhGaa	My 1 year old runs away when you try to get him dressed.  He will even walk towards you and then back away smiling.  This game is not always cute and funny. <br>  <br>  My 3 year old has no patience and when you tell him no he always asks "maybe later?" and even if you have no intention of allowing him to do the activity he will not stop saying "maybe later?" until you say "yes, maybe later." <br>  <br>  My 10 year old tells little lies that really make me angry because he thinks I am dumb enough to be outsmarted by him.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	she changed my name from mommy to But Mommy Why.  Its a full name now.|`|2fB383F2aa	When I'm cooking dinner and my 2 year old daughter walks in and asks "what doing mommy?" I'll tell her I'm cooking dinner which always leads to her running around the kitchen island screaming "make dinner, make dinner" over and over again. I mean it was cute at first, but now it's just annoying and getting worse because she has the dog running behind her! I just tell her to run around the dining room table now lol, still annoying, but at least not in my way!|`|ZadTQtJaaa	My step daughter thinks that every time the stupid phone rings it's time to put on a show.  She will come sit RIGHT beside me, and chatter, sing, clap, anything to make noise and drive me crazy.  She can be in her room playing, soon as the phone rings she's in my ear either making noise, or saying "Can I talk, Can I talk, Can I talk...." AAAAGGGHHHHH|`|7c9a6ac2b60c434d81159b0728373573aa	Constant Repeating! He says the same thing over and over and over again. Even after I've answered or acknowledged him 3 or 4 times.|`|imziSPonaa	Eating with his mouth open and smacking the entire time.  Have probably told him to eat with his mouth closed about a million times.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	When he drinks his bottle, he rolls the nipple around in his mouth and chews on it. He also squirms a lot when I try to feed him.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i hate it when im cooking and my daughter wraps her armsand legs around my leg and just hangs around lol even worse when im wearing cotton trousers and she trys her hardest to pull them own...i mean seriously|`|MI53mUKzaa	my husband started it bt one of my sons calls me "Mummsie" I can not stand it.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	I hate when my kids say "What the..."  It's very common among the 6-year-old world and I cannot stand it!|`|qRDHEGHJaa	every time i get on the phone or go to cook something that dont my 3 cant be a part of really they act like totally crazy kids yelling top of lungs fighting throwing fits anything for me to stop what ever im doing and get them. of course they are only 4   2  and 10 months tho so what should i expect lol im a stay at home mother so i know they get more attention then they could ever dream of|`|uWnLJYj2aa	Which kid?lol The 15yr old bossing over my instructions to the others, my 14yr old saying she can do her pouty face to get daddy to give her anything (what world does she live in?), my instant tears to get his way 10yr old, and that is just this week! Read more about our fab 5 on our parenting blog <a href="http://tips-for-parenting.info." rel="nofollow">http://tips-for-parenting.info.</a>|`|f1nX6thdaa	If I have to use the phone my daughters completely take advantage of me! They'll run inside the house, pull snacks out of the cupboard. You name it....it seriously makes me crazy.|`|oDlDrjF1aa	my son will sit there and say over and over mom mom mom mom mom mom and then ill say wat  and he says either hi or i forgot and then starts Again he is 11 months old he can say alot  of words but those are his favorite|`|y0iXEYkvaa	Well the most annoying thing my 15 year old daughter does is lie.<br>  The most annoying thing my 4 year old son does is whine.|`|wqbZbwpBaa	My cousin says text with a lisp. He told my aunt that I was sexing a boy and I got in trouble - I was TEXTing a boy. lol|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Bamming on the door as soon as I go to the bathroom yelling "MOOOOMMM"!  <br>  <br>  Des: my 12 yr. old still does the potty dance!!! LOL  Drives me crazy!|`|cAtWxJG1aa	one of my kids who is certainly old enough to know better will not use the bathroom until it is obvious to everyone that it is time to do so.<br>  <br>  what is with that? what age do most kids outgrow the "potty dance?"|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	Umm.. my kids don't really annoy me. Well, when my son (10yr old)and I play video games, sometimes he commentates and give scene by scene synopsis of what's going on. It annoys me because he only does it when it's my turn and he HATES it when I do it to him.<br>  <br>  With my baby (5mos), it annoys me how I'll be playing with her and no matter what we're doing, AS SOON as my husband comes in the room she forgets I'm even there. It's not really an annoyance.. more like a light hearted jealousy and it's not at the baby, but my husband. I'm like "dont you have a game to play or something?" It's all in fun. My kids, my family period, are a joy to be around. There isn't a whole lot that sticks out in my mind that would be an annoyance. When my son doesn't do what he's told, it ticks me off, but I expect him to not listen sometimes so it's not really that big of a deal. That's what kids do.
oYmZUO8Caa	Bella and Andrew? Hm. I honestly don't think there could be a mix, haha. <br>  <br>  Do you like Elise, Analise, Kaelin/Kaitlin, Kahlen, Sherilyn?|`|fboC1N7gaa	Combining Bella and Andrew you would get Annabelle or Annabella.  You could also do Adabelle or Adabella.  In terms of similar names to Evelyn...<br>  Eve<br>  Eva<br>  Ava<br>  Avalyn<br>  Evette<br>  Yvonne<br>  Yvonne<br>  Lynne<br>  Linea<br>  Lynette<br>  Ellen<br>  Ellena|`|AA10372890	I like Evelyn.

My son's too young, can I borrow Johnny when the time comes?|`|nfzQkvqraa	Well before it's deleted I can understand why you asked it.  I just got bashed sort of for defending you so I am annoyed with your troll.  I can't imagine how you're feeling.  <br>  <br>  I think if I met any of these trolls in real life I would laugh in their face.  I would love to see how "perfect" they really are.  Generally people who lash out at others are insecure about themselves.|`|0QYIbn1saa	I would tell them to grab their ankles, and let Eli have at them with his new wooden hammer!  YIPPEE!!!|`|iHJuXKBiaa	Not even, trolls stay crunchy in milk.....|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I'd make sure he had something for her butt.  JOKING<br>  <br>  <br>  Can someone please tell me why I asked the finger/ butt question???  JEN.... Another speak before I think kinda thing, LOL!|`|cAtWxJG1aa	give the little guys some credit.  i think even my kids would realize a person like that isn't worth their time.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I'd just tell them their life is so sad.  It must be terrible to have no life other than to harass people you don't know.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'd let my daughter tooth 'em a couple times, lol.  They would be terrified of my son... he's will run them to death!|`|j2mRop0laa	I suppose one could stab troll with her paint brushes and the other could swing a microphone at trolls head.<br>  Oh that would be funny!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  OMG...s@hm... see? I knew exactly who the troll was! I knew it I knew it *doing my knew it dance!*|`|TQW5E6olaa	Depends on how mean the troll is, I think I'd borrow a mean dog instead, Bella's too sweet.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	You should see Dylan with a hockey stick...<br>  <br>  LOOK OUT!<br>  <br>  ** ADD **<br>  <br>  I love when she disappears....
yKS2UI87aa	OK This is a weird way but the only way I could think of to explain it. Tighten your heiney, that's what it feels like only in you stomach. Braxton Hicks are normal and come and go throughout pregnancy. Mine usu. lasted about a hour.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Like something is squeezing your stomach.  I know this is a bad way to describe it, but like a vacuum cleaner in a plastic bag......it seems to pull everything in.|`|9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	It's a bit like a muscle cramp but not as painful. Your stomach feels really hard like a football, and you feel a squeezing sensation. If you get them more than every 12 minutes though, speak to a doctor or midwife, they shouldn't be more frequent than that at your stage of pregnancy.

Im in North Carolina... Its really sad that he lost 4 people really close to him because of tuberculosis. But what is amazing is that he didn't get it and its so contagious. Keep on learning he was a very interesting man.|`|tZl7EDDeaa	no i didnt, until you mentioned it.|`|St6Jvc3Daa	Actually I did.<br>  (:|`|d0fa25b284e1f0b5318568250948279baa	Yes, I did.  Poe is one of my favorite authors.|`|bfhsP4GFaa	YEP! I used to be Poe obsessed. A friend of mine just got a back tattoo (the entire size of her back) of vibrant flowers coming out of a skull, with ribbons wrapping around it that say "From Childhood's Hour".<br>  <br>  It's BEAUTIFUL.|`|SrcoG7JRaa	Yep. I watched a special on him on Biography at 4am once.<br>  He also took off his pants and wandered around Baltimore drunk.<br>  <br>  He's one of my favorites. As for the little snarky cynicism, "times haven't changed," there will always be people who do the wrong thing with their kids, adopted or not.
8cd6d1064a8d6379febc6914e867a26baa	I like the name, its pretty.<br>  <br>  But that was kind of a coincidence.<br>  There is a girl at my school named Shelby, and me and her have some serious problems. Expecially today they got worse.<br>  So when I saw this question my jaw dropped.<br>  <br>  Not very good experiences with the name, but its a nice name.|`|OEMIkJTUaa	I like it! I think it is unique, not overly used!|`|qkCdLp92aa	It is a nice name you just have to match it with another good name.<br>  exp:<br>  Shelby Rose|`|g8jHYetnaa	i love it ... some day i'd like to name my daughter Shelby Danielle|`|4QuFVM38aa	The first thing that comes to my mind is a car....its a unique name sure but im not a fan sorry.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	too hillbilly

Nolan and Foster are ok.<br>  <br>  What about Grace, Kate, Ella, Claire and Noelle for possible middle names for girls?  They would go well with your first name choices.

1ezYfkX7aa	I have never done this with my kids but many people have done it and their kids are fine....my grandmother did it with my parents and aunts & uncles...they all turned out fine lol.|`|Cwqkbp49aa	I think it was common back in the day, don't think it is so common today.  I know plenty of kids (now adults) who have had it done (a long time ago).<br>  <br>  Being that the purpose of soap isn't for that, I don't think it's a good idea.  Too many other options that can have a positive outcome.|`|m2jeeo4Laa	It didn't damage me, but I remember wondering why it was okay for my mom to use the words I got soap or hot sauce for.  I won't do it to my daughter.|`|0ab6fc7bd98309110aaef7ff59e4615caa	Yes, it will hurt a child because of chemicals in your mouth.  It can be poison.|`|2mHbi6Exaa	i don't know. you'd think it would make the kids sick if they swallowed any of the soap. My mom used to do that with us too, but then we started blowing bubbles with it and laughing, so it wasn't much of a punishment.|`|kuHE3z2Maa	This is NEVER ok! Today's soaps have chemicals that aren't meant to be ingested and can be harmful. Putting chemicals in a child's mouth as a form of discipline is child abuse. Plus, what is this teaching a child?|`|YQRdXrFaaa	I had my mouth washed out with soap as they say when I was young it was yuk! but I didn't get sick or anything, I do know though that it didn't stop me from swearing! So a pretty pointless ordeal I won't try it on mine.|`|MPYQ2Mfuaa	its very harmful ..i never had it done to me .. but i think ur kids would hate u if u did that to them|`|G2auAv1Saa	If it was that harmful my brother, sisters and most everyone else from my generation would all be dead and that was before they really regulated ingredients put into stuff. <br>  <br>  It's probably not the best thing to do and I guess some soaps could be harmful I wouldn't do it to a young child- but I would to a teenager.|`|AA11210211	You CAN hurt a child by doing this yes.
zLoyo24Taa	After spending a lot of time looking at both US and international adoptions, we decided to go international. We are not adopting infants, we are adopting older children. The reasons we decided to go international is that there are many children in orphanages, they do not even have foster families in some countries. International adoption is not a choice everyone makes, but it is the one my husband and I made.|`|2wyDALHgaa	I chose both.  Our circumstances were such though that we were living temporarily overseas for abut 3 years and we chose to adopt while we were there.  Once we returned home however we had one natural child and then, just last year, we chose to adopt again.  Our second one was adopted through domestic foster care.|`|b1e7acd9969e11fd38ae40bfed0968bfaa	My wife and I adopted domestically (US).  There are pluses and minuses no matter how you go.  The horror stories we heard about overseas adoption scared us away.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Im looking at Russia/Ukraine. Im in the UK. I'm not keen on the current system here.|`|iVcaB9h7aa	We adopted through an agency in the US.  Our daughter was born about an hour's drive away.<br>  <br>  We choose domestic adoption for one overwhelming reason:  open adoption.  We didn't want to raise a child without maintaining a relationship with his/her natural family.  It didn't sit well with me to know if I adopted by another means there would be a woman out there who may never know what became of her child.  I also wanted to be able to give my child the chance to know his/her natural family and to have them in her/his life.<br>  <br>  We've been in a fully open adoption for ten years now and I wouldn't have it any other way.|`|3AfQ9UXYaa	When I do get older (19 is too young) I want to adopt from foster care but that doesn't mean I wouldn't do international adoption. I plan on going with the flow and what feels right. I'll be traveling alot in the near future so it's highly possible I just might do international adoption first who knows.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	I wouldn't adopt, but I would highly suggest looking into domestic foster care adoptions, rather than using a corrupt agency to further allow them to sell babies.|`|J2glFOkhaa	There are plenty of needed American children here who need love and a good home.<br>  <br>  If we decide to adopt, we will most definitely stay in the US|`|OQnRP6xVaa	We chose to adopt siblings waiting in foster care in the State we were living in at the time we adopted.|`|kBp9IzQqaa	You could check your own backyard.  US has so many children.  They would like a home, too.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	I plan on adopting through foster care in the next 3 years. But I'm open to adopting international at some point after that. <br>  <br>  You have to be comfortable which ever path you decide to go down. There are goods and bads about each route you just have to find which suits your family best, regardless of what others think is right/proper.
hVVALFAPaa	There are many causes for stillbirths in humans but often no one can know for sure. Guinea pigs are probably the same.<br>  <br>  Sorry for your loss.<br>  <br>  You may want to re-post this question in the Pets section.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	Ask this in the guinea pig section.
gEtg9LOiaa	It is normal I had braxton hicks after my 31st week. The doctors told me it was just my body making more room for the baby to get down in my pelvic bone and everything.|`|BbwI6CJqaa	Hi there, that sounds like BH.  You will know when the real thing happens, it is just like opening an oven in your belly.|`|f4c31ffa76035961741011f2df6b939aaa	My 1st one was today and I am 32w 1d|`|MtC3CWZraa	Probably are BHs. They can start as early as 20 weeks.|`|6PEOqeLOaa	around 28 weeks i think i started to notice them...don't worry about them they will come and once you figure out when your having them you will notice them more and more until they become annoying!
wURg3jBcaa	I think for most of her pictures, have her in just her diaper.  I think babies look so cute in black & white photos and it's just their skin.  My daughter had a pro do a portrait sitting, and we framed a series of photos of her wrapped only in a fuzzy white blanket.  When you do the family pictures done, I wouldn't put her in anything too frilly.  I think the focus should be on how beautiful your baby & family are, and not about the outfits.  (Ditto for the parents- simple black or white tops look best in b&w photos.)|`|YEqQZgs5aa	My favorite baby pics are always in diapers with a nice white blanket done in black n white... I have seen some cute ones where they put a necklace on the baby to make it more obv. its a girl..  <br>  <br>  even though its not summer I think dresses would be fine, your indoors and who cares that it was cold out when they were done, if they are cute - go for it...  I meean it may be a lil off to put her in a really "summery dress' but just a dress would be fine|`|lWVgQYs8aa	Maybe you could get a little sweater or undershirt for the cute dresses. I also have a 5 month old, and its cold where we are too. However, I would still put her in those dresses. Maybe you can go look at some of the gently used childs clothing stores to see if there is anything there that you think would be cute. They should be pretty cheap and barely worn since they are dresses. When my daughter wears dresses on special occasions we put her in leggings and undershirts. Its still very cute. But if you decide to go with the sweater. You could always take it off for some pictures since it should be warm in the building where the pictures are being taken.<br>  <br>  Good luck!! =]
SDjrojZXaa	noahs ark would be cute because 2 by 2|`|Cwqkbp49aa	I don't have any pics, but we did an animal theme.  Half of the wall is green like grass, the other half is light blue like the sky.  We did a 2-D effect; painted trees, but then hot glued leaves on the wall (fake leaves).  Used wall stickers for the animals and glued on cotton for the clouds (we had to work w/ the cotton to form it properly).  Everyone loves it!  We didn't know if we were having a boy or girl ahead of time, so it worked well for us.<br>  <br>  Other themes:<br>  <br>  Noah's Ark<br>  Winnie the Pooh<br>  Sesame Street<br>  Multi-colored theme (maybe paint two walls green, two walls yellow, etc).<br>  Under the sea theme<br>  Animal theme<br>  Princess theme (girl)<br>  Flower theme(girl)<br>  Car, planes, trains (boy)<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun with it!|`|ILbgqBLxaa	my favorites are baby circus with cute pics like this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.comparestoreprices.co.uk/images/nu/nursery-dandeacute-cor-circus-6-wallpaper-border-self-adhesive.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.comparestoreprices.co.uk/imag...</a><br>  <br>  or a jungle like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.wendyswalls.com/5x7jungle_buddies72dpi.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.wendyswalls.com/5x7jungle_bud...</a><br>  <br>  if you are a disney fan:<br>  <a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UPKik9VSL._SL500_AA280_.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51...</a><br>  <br>  frogs are cute =):<br>  <a href="http://www.unique-baby-gear-ideas.com/images/frognurserythemefroggytales.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.unique-baby-gear-ideas.com/im...</a><br>  <br>  underwater:<br>  <a href="http://www.babybeddingtown.com/images/Go-Fish-revamp-BG.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.babybeddingtown.com/images/Go...</a><br>  <br>  western:<br>  <a href="http://www.unique-baby-gear-ideas.com/images/redbabybeddingbuckaroobananafish.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.unique-baby-gear-ideas.com/im...</a><br>  <br>  spring/green:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturesbabystore.com/images/summersault.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturesbabystore.com/images/s...</a><br>  <br>  the most important thing is to think like a child and make it fun! =)|`|wFfeayBMaa	Polka dots & stripes<br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3066859" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3066854" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a><br>  Jungle theme<br>  Winnie the pooh<br>  Under the sea<br>  Ladybug<br>  Floral<br>  <br>  These are just some basic ideas.

YEqQZgs5aa	I only get 3-4 oz per session, I pump every 3 hrs while at work.. I think pumping at 1 would be too soon..<br>  <br>  It would def. help alot if you pumped overnight (I also would rather my sleep so I dont)<br>  <br>  I was taking fenugreek and within like 3 days it helped my supply, was getting about 6 oz per pumping.. then I kept forgetting to take it.. gonna start again soon!<br>  <br>  I also didnt take as much as it said - I could start smeelling the "syrupy smell" so I was taking 2 pills in the am, 1 at lunch and 1 with dinner... it still did the trick wihtout making me smell like syrup!|`|sNQdUZxuaa	Don't know.. im sure everyone has different answers for this.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	talk to your doctor when he/she gets back|`|AA11903503	I would feed from one breast only and pump from the other when ever you would normally feed. Within about 2 days your supply should begin to increase. I've also heard that pumping while nursing gets you more from the pumped breast.<br>  I can pump about 5oz in 5 minutes every 3 hours.<br>  I wouldn't worry about pumping at night, my baby only wakes up once per night or after 6-7 hours of sleep and my supply is still good.
DvnOIx1laa	I can understand your frustration, and you have every right to be p!ssed! don't feed into her stupidity by going over there though! People like that are unhappy, and unhappy people try to make everyone around them miserable! Just think about it.... When you are in a bad mood, doesn't it suck to have someone all happy around! So the best torture for this old ***** is to just act happy, and it will p!ss her off even more! I know, I live with my mother in-law who is miserable, unhappy and negative all the time, and she constantly tries to bring us down with her!!!<br>  That sux though!! I am sorry you have to even deal with a situation like that! I totally understand how sick it is for anyone to say rude things about your Innocent children! god help her!|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	No matter how wrong an old person is, the young person always looks like the azz cussing or yelling at an elderly person.|`|yB5go5wbaa	What an crotchety old lady.  I wouldn't say anything more, just because she got her comeuppance by having to leave!  Hopefully you won't run into her for the next 30 days :)|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I wouldn't even bother. If someone said something like that about my baby, I know I would be furious. But why waste your time? She's not even worth it. It seems to me like she FEEDS off of making other people mad. She's probably waiting for you to go over and yell and scream at her. Ignore her.. that clearly bothers her. I would pretend she didn't even exist.|`|5dRvtaGgaa	Wow!!  What a Whacko!  I wouldn't bother with her at all.  She has enough problems.  At least she got kicked out of the complex so you won't have to worry about her anymore.  Karma has a way of taking care of people like that.  I understand that you're mad, and I would sure want to say something, also, but be the bigger person.  She obviously, isn't able to do that.|`|UXhFcHCHaa	i know i know!! calm down take a breath and count to ten. if u need more count away lol. if she is already leaving dont cause anymore problems bc well you could be next. let it go and i hope it taught her a lesson in how she talks to people.|`|frpCK0utaa	oh wow what a witch! but i would be the bigger person and leave her alone. She'll be gone soon enough, and all it would cause is more trouble.<br>  <br>  *hugs* been there, its HELL!|`|GpR5MI5raa	Well at least she's kicked out. she definitley sounds like a B**** but just let her go. You dont need more trouble or more fuel to get you this upset.|`|Xijr73Vfaa	Feel better now? Just get it out....|`|ME62Mtv4aa	Well she is the one that has to leave so she got what was coming to her all you should do now is smile and wave! :)<br>  I was always taught kill them with kindness and I'm sure when she is leaving if you had a big ol smile on your face while waving her off she would be really pissed.|`|jlUczlQZaa	Although her actions were abusive and uncalled for, I think when someone is berating another without due cause one should consider the source and just walk away.  She could have dementia, mental-health issues, etc. <br>  <br>  Walking away and not giving her a platform is the best answer.  I would not be angry with her at all because I know what she is saying is untrue and she is just venting to someone who is there.   I would show by example how it is to be kind to others and not react to her outbursts.<br>  <br>  Your reaction is a testament to her behaviour, if it's not true, then why do you care what she says or does?  Leave her alone and avoid her until she leaves.  I would actually act kind to her and see what happens, she may be shocked to see someone not fall for her instigating berating!|`|pXSKSS3daa	I'd leave it alone. It's not worth stirring up more trouble, especially if she's leaving within a month.<br>  <br>  I'd be more inclined to feel sorry for her, actually. It's a sad, sad, person that constantly needs to nag and berate people. She must not have much to live for and misery loves company, doesn't it?<br>  <br>  I wouldn't be overly friendly to her by any means but be civil with her this next month. I know I hate unecessary drama in my life.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Old ladies are cranky.  She sounds like a pain in the ***, but I wouldn't confront her.  What's the point?
7XG5fd5Xaa	I would consult your doctor. I have had a miscarriage, but I didnt know I was pregnant at all. I was 4-6wks, I was about 16 days late on my period and all the sudden I had very bad pains in my stomach, like cramps but way worse. I had to go to the hospital, cause I could barely walk. they took a preg test and it was neg, so I got xrays then they told me the test turned positive. Then I had an ultrasound, THey told me I was having a miscarriage because the preg was on my ovary. If left untreated I could of died. I felt sick and in pain for the next 10 days straight while i was having the miscarriage, you really need to talk to a doctor. Hope this helps, and I hope everything goes ok for you. i know having my miscarriage was one of the worst things I have ever had to deal with.|`|xyV5xe26aa	I also had lower Beta Hcg levels during the 5th - 6th week. My gynaecologist prescribed me Duphaston, which contains dyhydrogesterone and is supposed to lower chances of miscarriages. Maybe you should consult a doctor/gynae and he/she will advise you about what you might have to take. <br>  And you mentioned you took pregnancy tests again and the line was "lighter"? I don't think you should worry because it's till too early to get a dark line, and results fluctuate. Its better to get your blood tested for presence of Beta Hcg levels.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I know that hormone levels have a peak usually and then they go down but I think that happens at around 20 weeks. Talk to your Ob/gyn .... I am sure you are ok.  Taking tests at different times can have an effect on the test too. Honestly I truly think you arnd your child are ok. Everyone has these times in the begining that they think everything is or is going to go wrong.. <br>  ?
046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	Are there reasons your mother doesn't like your friends other than the fact they are Black?  Are you just assuming that is her reason?  The only way to know is to ask her why she doesn't like your friends. Use their names when you ask and let her bring up color if it is an issue. If the news is you were right, don't subject your friends to her prejudice.  It is her problem and you don't need to make it yours or your friends.  If you are welcome to visit their homes do so and see them at school, the mall, etc.  You won't change your mother's mind about being a bigot if she is one, so don't try.  <br>  <br>  Just know that each generation of a family typically hopes the next one achieves more than they did in all areas of life.  If your mother is a racist then you've achieved something that her generation did not; a broader world view.  Congratulate yourself and enjoy your friends.|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	I know it may seem hard but just ask her: "Why don't you like ____ and _______?"<br>  See what she says.|`|BNe9GIkGaa	I think you should confront her,<br>  not in a "are u racist?" way becuz that will be awkward for both of you, but as more of a "mom ive been meaning to talk to you about a certain problem" type of way ya know<br>  <br>  and be honest and let her know you have a problem dealing with the idea also, theres a 50/50 chance she is or isnt but at least you will know|`|AA11830777	You should talk to her. It's better to know where she stands. If she is, well that's her unfortunate flaw. As long as your friends are good ppl then it doesn't matter what she thinks. Just because she is your parent doesn't give her the right to force her racism on you.|`|ELSKfMpxaa	She's an adult and entitled to her own opinions, as are you, get over it (unless she's being overtly rude, then confront her)|`|1SGhenQBaa	dude, confront her. damn racists with their non-asian liking and their funny cars and funny tasting... stuff
tQPvv0Glaa	Yes, you can try a VBAC!  The only reason you couldn't would be if you had to have a c-section for a reason that was the same in this pregnancy - like if the baby was breech or if your pelvis were too small or something like that.  I had an emergency c-section with my first baby because he was breech, but since then I've had two vaginal births.  You can do it!  Just make sure your doctor is on board, and if for some reason he/she doesn't want you really want to try for a VBAC, you can find another doctor who will let you try.  Good luck!|`|9P26sacKaa	Just looking at this information, you would almost certainly be a good candidate for VBAC.  I would get involved with ICAN, either online or in your area if there are meetings, and see which doctors are the best ones for VBAC.  Some doctors say they do VBACs, then it turns out you have to follow all sorts of ridiculous and unnecessary rules that make you more likely to have another c-section.  It is REALLY immensely important that you get a good doctor or midwife.  You are probably even a good candidate for a homebirth VBAC (HBAC).  Homebirth midwives are very good at keeping a woman low risk through diet and lifestyle and just talking with them.  You're generally more likley to become high risk if you start out low-risk and a're seeing a doctor than if you're seeing a midwife, either a homebirth midwife or a hospital midwife.  Being a VBAC does not automatically make you high risk, by the way.  The rate of catastrophic uterine rupture, where there is permanent damage or death to the baby is only 1 in 2000 VBACs, which makes it less likely than a lot of other complications of vaginal birth or c-section that could result in these outcomes.  <br>  <br>  If you want to continue having children, it would definitely be worth persuing a VBAC actively.  It might mean a fight for your rights, depending on where you are.<br>  <br>  If you want to see what hospital policies about VBACs in your area, you can look on ICAN's new list of this information.  It can be hard to find the information right now because it's just recently been put up.  <a href="http://ican-online.org/vbac-ban-info" rel="nofollow">http://ican-online.org/vbac-ban-info</a>  Go here, and at the bottom of the page, you can see where it allows you to search for hospitals according to ban status: allowed, banned, de facto ban, or all hospitals.  If you look up all hospitals, it will a bit to load, but you can then scroll down to your state and look for the hospitals near you.  <br>  <br>  If you go onto the main part of ICAN's web site, you can look at the VBAC section for lots of information.  You can also go to the community section and join forums or email lists to get information, support, and all sorts of things from the women of ICAN.  It's a great resource for anyone who wants a VBAC or information about resources and the studies on VBAC versus c-sections, information on c-sections, what options you might have in your area, etc.  <a href="http://www.ican-online.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ican-online.org</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|F8iyUqJBaa	I suggest trying to find a midwife that will attend a vbac, it is much safer and having repeat major abdominal surgeries is very unsafe.  The scar tissue alone cause major risks and yes it will hinder having many more than 2 or 3 children.  Doctors don't like to do VBACs because a lot of them, their insurance won't cover them if they do and others is because they just prefer to have something quick to put on their schedule and they can do that with a C section.  <br>  A midwife will work closely with you and your body and it will be a much more enjoyable experience.  They also teach you how to eat and exercise right so you don't have those risk factors like high blood pressure.|`|xpstigPTaa	I'm sorry but what the heck is up with your typing?!? It makes it very very hard to read? Why do you do that?!? And your spelling is pretty scary!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well it depends on where your incisions are.  Most emergency sections have the vertical cut and with those you have to have another c-section.  I had a c-section with my first and currently 27 weeks pregnant with number 2.  Once my new doctor made sure that both my external and internal incisions were low and horizontal she said I could try for a vbac since there was no other medical reason (placenta previa or genetic problems) for a c-seciton.  It all depends.|`|6DNHxcSsaa	Yes, you can try for a vaginal birth after your c section. You just might have difficulty finding a provider willing, not because it's too dangerous but because they have to eliminate ANYTHING they could be sued for if it's not a good outcome. This web site might prove very helpful to you. It has helped thousands of women make the right choice for them.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ican-online.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ican-online.org/</a><br>  <br>  Birth blessings to you.|`|0UzfNoA2aa	hi i also had 2 have an emergency c section for my son which i was devastated about. my consultant said that there was no reason i couldn't go on to have a normal delivery the next time if all goes well. Good Luck x|`|AA11210211	Please hun learn to type it is hard for people to understand what you are saying when you do this.The only one who would know is your OGBYN please talk to him/her at your next app.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	As long as your BP doesn't get dangerously high, you could probably try one. It depends on what your doctor says, but if you want to do one, then find a doctor who will support your decision. Obviously some people are better candidates than others, but there is nothing saying your last situation will repeat itself. <br>  <br>  First - do as much reading and research as you can. There are tons of good websites to read as well as books, too. The VBAC Companion is one you might find helpful and can usually find at your local library. Know the risks and get as much info as you can so you can be as informed as possible going into it. <br>  <br>  Second - find people who have done it before who can offer you helpful advice and support, not criticism and negativity. That is very important; at least it was to me. <br>  <br>  In your research, you will learn some important things: that even women who have been diagnosed with 'small pelvis/big baby' can have a baby vaginally that's bigger than the first. Also, Pitocin induction is not recommended because it can make contractions stronger and put you at higher risk for uterine rupture. And also that your risks of complications in a C-section are about the SAME as with a VBAC.

AA11660585	hi i was pregnant 3 times my first i was always throwing up none stop my 2nd it was very very bad cramps felt like i was going 2 have a miscarriage so i was hospitalized 4 3 days but they said it was just the baby pushing on stuff 2 make it uncomfortable so its normal but good luck on ur baby n congratulations|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	There is no need to call if it is only cramping.  If bleeding starts, then yes, call, but otherwise it could just be your body adjusting to the baby.|`|nXMy2qDkaa	It can come from dehydration drink up!|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I had some cramping in the beginning, and personally, any cramping at all would warrant a call to the doctor's office!  I would call and ask your doc to see what they say!  I had mild cramping in the beginning and they had me come in to rule out an ectopic pregnancy, which can be very very dangerous.  Good luck!|`|HMwBx17xaa	I had cramps and spotting and all was fine. But I panicked like you and wrote into yahoo and answer bag. It's natural - esp for first timers - to be anxious. But much of the time unfounded! Good luck with it all!|`|AqU180claa	It's probably normal. Your probably Just having braxtion hicks contractions.  I had Braxtion hicks contactions all through my  second pregnancy for like the whole time I was pregnant.  <br>  When your pregnant you'll probably always be alittle uncomfortable.|`|0pmYRlMcaa	Cramps are normal, I have heavy cramps all the time.  My doc said as long as I am not bleeding.  My first one was like that and this one is too.  You are probably starting to stretch and your legiments are causing the pain.
tQPvv0Glaa	I'm sure they would call you if there was a problem (no news is good news!), but you could call and ask for the results just to put your mind at ease.|`|ZEYEmYRtaa	Yes No news is good news if they found any thing in your results that was of any thing of concern they would have contacted you ASAP x<br>  Hope this helps x|`|98WKYtfwaa	They only inform you if there is a problem. You'll get the results either way at your next antenatal appointment.|`|xy5UNiELaa	It's according to what you were tested for.  If a disease or illness, they should contact you via phone if positive.  If negative, they would more than likely send you something in the mail (or phone).  If it's for pregnancy, they should call.  If it's for tests DURING pregnancy, positive means a call, negative means nothing (or reassurance at your next appt).  Good luck.|`|4d609fcce5f5f73d048fa387f7f37eacaa	It depends on your dr. I have had both happen.<br>  <br>  They should have your results by now. And if they haven't given you a call, the results are probably good. If you're concerned, give them a call! They are working for you, and if you need peace of mind they should be more than willing to provide it.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	they usually only call if something 'bad' shows up but it depends on what you were tested for. just call the doctors office and ask if the results are back yet to be sure.
gx4s68s8aa	Most doctors don't do the test until after three.  But some are now doing the test after 2 especially if they are two in a row and if your mother, sister, or grandmother (on your father's side) had two or more miscarriages in a row.<br>  <br>  So really it is somewhat up to you.  If you feel like you want or need the testing and you have had less than three miscarriages, then just call talk to your doctor.  Or you can try to find another doctor in your area that will do the tests.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Usually after three miscarriages women choose to see a specialist to determine the cause.|`|AaXl3vcCaa	testing for what? i know lots of girls who have had miscarriages and they usually know why they lost it, the doctors do tests there so what are you asking if they test for?|`|IEZoHcysaa	Your doctor will let you know if you need to have any test.
WWcaKZ7Qaa	Well, it sounds like everything is going perfectly so far! I would try to calm down, I think most women in that stage of pregnancy have the exact same fear, I know I did. It's still possible to have a miscarriage, but honestly, there is a chance of losing the baby throughout the whole pregnancy, so just try to relax. It's not something you have control over anyhow. If I were you, I wouldn't worry, you don't have any signs of a miscarriage or anything. You'll probably feel better when you see the heartbeat! :]|`|FjGeKhY0aa	It is normal to be that scared, I think all women go through this during the first 3 months but just try to take it easy, don't thing about it too much because you'll just drive yourself nuts. When you'll have your ultrasound you will feel better seeing that the baby is there and everything is fine. Just follow your Dr's advice and take it easy for now. Good luck!|`|CuCrGDuRaa	My doctor told me that one in three pregnancies ends in miscarriage.  About 95% of miscarriages happen before 13 weeks.  While most miscarriages have symptoms such as bleeding, lower back pain, and/of fever, some have no signs at all.  I went in for a 12 week ultrasound last year and found out my baby had died weeks before then, but I had no symptoms of miscarriage at all.  While you need to know that miscarriage is always a possibility, odds are you won't have one and there is no use worrying about it.  Try to stay positive.  Good luck!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think it's normal to be scared. Just don't get too scared that you stress yourself out and that causes a miscarriage. I'm sure your baby is going to be fine and healthy. Just stay positive and I'm sure it will be fine! It doesn't even sound like your going to have a miscarriage so don't worry! Congratulations and good luck with the rest of your pregnancy!!|`|DDnxY3k1aa	it's said most women can't carry their babies.. but it seems to me a lot do. well i don't think it's likely it would be you such a thing happens to. you probably have nothing to worry about. i'm glad for you you are pregnant. i wish it was true i was...|`|wFe7L1XJaa	Slim to non as long as your taking good care of yourself and make sure you take your vitamins just because you dont feel preggers doesnt mean your not good luck and dont worry <br>  <br>  congratulations|`|rzf4tMXGaa	Don't worry so much, I know it's really hard. I was extremely paranoid for the first 3 months, and I'm still paranoid now at 22 weeks. I guess it's normal. The only thing you can do is hope for the best.  I think after week 12 you are in the clear, til then just be positive.  Try not to read so much about miscarriages, that can get you even more paranoid.  Just relax, I'm sure you will feel much better after you have heard the heartbeat.  <br>  <br>  p.s. <br>  no spotting means most likely everything is fine!|`|nFW8QeBsaa	It is possible but dont give up so soon. There is always chance for a miscarriage up to 20 weeks. They say once you hear the heartbeat and baby is developing at normal pace there should be nothing to worry about. I spot now because I am bleeding behind my placenta and baby is fine. Just be positive...|`|NdKLtgqBaa	I remember those days: wanting so badly to be pregnant it was hard to put it out of your mind. However, I would say you are on the right road. Worrying about it won't get you any further, and certainly won't make you any more pregnant. Your body is doing the right stuff right now with your boobs hurting even though you don't have any morning sickness; not everybody gets that. The fact that you haven't had any spotting is good. I would say for you to not worry about a miscarriage. Of course, there is always that possibility, even later on, depending on the situation. But you aren't showing any risk factors right now. And I think the more you worry, sometimes you might bring stuff on yourself you might have avoided had you not gone down that road to begin with.<br>  So try to rest easy and enjoy this time...after all, even though at the beginning it seems long, nine months really isn't all that long.<br>  <br>  Check out my web page at www.classymaternity.com for great maternity clothes to make you feel good during your pregnancy!

Lots goes on!! dont worry you will only get bigger. invest in some maternity pants!!<br>  5 lbs is a healthy gain so sounds like you are right on track!!!|`|eU5Eth2aaa	It may just be bloating or the little bit of weight you have gained.  At 13 weeks you might have a real baby bump starting though!<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|PfIywLLyaa	I had the same problem! I was 5'2" and 105 lbs, and at 5 weeks I could not wear ANY of my pants due to a round hard belly! I had to go buy maternity pants to wear, and the shop owner couldn't believe I was "showing" at 5 weeks. It is bloating, and it sucks, I know!|`|Kz5Fb0mPaa	I started showing VERY early. I knew it wasnt bloating because it was taking more of a shape instead of the bloated look. I started showing between 9-10 weeks and I had gained around 3 lbs at that time. I am now 20 weeks and everyone says I look like I'm further along. I did start wearing maternity pants at 10 weeks because my pants were too uncomfortable! Hope this helps!|`|kgE96Nhcaa	Sounds like it could be a combination of both.  Is it your first pregnancy?  Usually you would show later so it may be just bloating.  Later pregnancies can show that early.  Have you tried anything for the bloating?  If it doesn't go away you probably have a bump.  Usually the bloating would be worse either in the morning or night (I've heard it both ways) but then you would fit your pants at the other end of the spectrum. Hope this helps!|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Bloating is common in early pregnancy, at about 8 weeks I couldn't fit into my pants, but it was mainly bloating.  But being 13 weeks, it may be the baby that is making your clothes tight.|`|186fde084a61fc7cf260841370aa6839aa	I think I just answered your other question too!  Believe me, what you're experiencing is well within the normal range.  I felt bloated and fat almost immediately, and my "slim" jeans were already uncomfortable at 8 weeks.<br>  <br>  Your round hard belly could be from constipation, if that's been an issue from you.  Not sure what else....|`|Y8KmfOOsaa	hmm. that kinda makes no sense, if you've only gained five pounds how did you jump from a 12 to a 16?<br>  <br>  it could possibly just be bloating, but 13 weeks is not too early to show.  think about it, there's three semesters to your baby: nine months, three months each. you're already past the three month marker, one third of the way to having a baby. it's not too early, believe me.<br>  <br>  of course some people show more than others, earlier than others. it all depends.|`|tgzGcu5uaa	Seems like a simple bloating problem- you should be fine in a few days. Its nothing to worry about. If it is a big problem they you can take some anti-bloating meds which should help alot.|`|6PEOqeLOaa	your probably just bloated you typically don't start showing until later on

2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	they say its better to eat 5-6 little meals a day anyhow so try that, instead of forcing it down.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Don't force yourself to eat meat. There are other ways to get protein,such as beans and lentils. Have you tried making yourself a vegetarian taco salad. With lettuce,tomatoes,cheddar cheese and black beans. I think it's actually better that way than with real meat. Much healthier too.|`|lLyyuPpvaa	It sounds like you are on the all too familiar pregnancy roller coaster.  First, let me tell you that what turns you off this week, or makes you gag may be the only thing you want to eat in 2 weeks.  Personally, I hated Ketchup, then about a month later I couldn't get enough of it, then a month after that it made me sick unless I mixed it with mayonnaise.  The roller coaster of pregnancy is harsh some times but you need to listen to your body.  If meat makes you bloated or gaggy then eat some almonds and nuts to get the protein you need.  For the first 4 months i couldn't eat anything bigger than a Jr. Whopper without feeling my stomach would explode!  So I ate a snack at 6am, 10am, 12pm, 3pm, and 6pm.  It sounds weird, but they were small snacks.  A cup of fruit, a 99 cent bag of nuts from a gas station, a snickers bar, a small muffin, a donut, a cheese stick....etc.  Your baby will take from you what it needs, whether you have excess or not, so just try and take your vitamins, and eat plenty of protein.  During month 5 I ate everything in sight, I could have eaten 2 regular whoppers, no problem.  Now i am in month 7 and I am back to smaller meals and snacks....gotta love the roller coaster!!!|`|86PuYgDJaa	Just snack on fruit and plainn biscuits/crackers. I wouldn't try to eat full meals if it's making you feel ill i'd just eat little and often to avoid the hungry feeling because sometimes that can make you feel sick. Try soda water with fruit juice or sparkling flavoured when you start to feel sick sometimes the bubbles can make you feel a little better.<br>  Ginger biscuits work wonders sometimes too!|`|qQsFTkWmaa	drink a Ensure before meals...   and take you prenatals..<br>  <br>  <br>  you wont have to "eat for 2"   thats a myth...  <br>  <br>  eat what amount you normaly eat....<br>  <br>  <br>  if you have a eating disorder... cunsult a Dr...<br>  <br>  but if you dont just eat regular avoiding fast foods and soda...  <br>  soda besides the cafine has a TON of suger witch will make you gain un-healthy wieght...<br>  <br>  try other protines like tofu, beans, eggs ect|`|AqU180claa	Maybe you could try eating a vegitarin diet.  Just fruits,veggies,and nuts,bean,pasta's and 100% juices and lots of water. I think that you will feel great if you do. Don't force yourself to eat meat.|`|9ro8fiKvaa	I had the same meat/fish problem when I was pregnant with my daughter. Don't worry about it but DO research how to get your protein. Chances are you will feel the same right after birth, especially if you are breastfeeding. Protein is VERY important in the healing process so find out what you like now so that you don't have to think about it after the baby is born. There are some really good vegetarian recipes out there - look for a lentil lasagna, veggie chilli, etc. Scrambled eggs with cheese and beans are easy & yummy ... good luck!|`|Inxmls7xaa	The most important thing is that you need to keep eating every 1-2 hours when you're pregnant.  Vegetables and fruits are highly recommended.  Don't depend on junk food.  <br>  <br>  Also, don't stay hungry for long hours, it's just not good for your system.  Eat just a little bit every 1-2 or 2-3 hours and you should be fine.  <br>  <br>  If you're too lazy to cook, then just steam your veggies and add salt  and black pepper over it and eat it like that.  It's tasty and healthy.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your baby!  And congratulations!|`|ANuNNnwiaa	well ive never been pregnant so im not really sure!!<br>  but u could try snacking on things that dont make u feel sick and gradually increase the amount u eat!!<br>  <br>  hope i helped

(ive done this many times) but the baby is fine and well protected no worries : )|`|Fd4lITkvaa	It doesn't do anything. I slept that way all the way until I gave birth. Your baby is well padded and your body won't let you do anything that will hurt either of you. If you remember from your last pregnancy how uncomfortable it is to lay on your back as you get bigger that's because it's not good for you or the baby. Your body is smart and will take care of both of you.|`|W1p6LetFaa	Baby is well padded in there.  If it doesn't hurt you, then it doesn't hurt baby.  It will hurt to lay on your stomach before it will hurt the baby.  Trust your body!|`|3qI1oyFaaa	Nothing. As long as you are still comfortable that way, it's totally safe. If it was causing harm to you or your baby, you would know it.

Doctor's tend to tell you as long as you're still comfortable on your stomach, you're okay.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	It's fine to sleep on your stomach, eventually you'll get so big you won't be able to anymore and you will toss and turn from side to side, so enjoy it now while you still can!|`|dDVAUA9saa	I'm 23 weeks and 3 days with my second and still sleep on my stomach.  It's more comfortable!  But my baby kicks me when i do it....LOL!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Nothing will happen to your baby if you sleep on your stomach. You can sleep on it as long as you're comfortable doing so. As soon as it get uncomfortable for you then sleep differently. Just don't sleep on your back because that can be dangerous for your baby. Good luck!|`|a7pgX1W8aa	No I don't think there should be any side effects from that. I did the same things when I was pregnant.

Once you get bigger it will be nearly impossible for you to sleep on your stomach, but for right now it's totally fine, especially concidering you are not COMPLETELY on your stomach.  <br>  <br>  Because I am not a dr.  I went and done some research just to reasure you of my opinion...<br>  <br>  Expert Answers off of this site <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/406_is-it-safe-to-sleep-on-my-stomach-during-pregnancy_1245307.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/406_is-it-safe...</a><br>  <br>  Catherine Lynch, ob-gyn, director of the division of general obstetrics and gynecology, University of South Florida, Tampa <br>  <br>  There's no problem lying on your stomach in early pregnancy. At this point, your uterus is still nestled behind your pubic bone, so it's totally protected. Later in your pregnancy, sleeping on your stomach just isn't going to be comfortable. You'd be too uncomfortable to want to do it long before you could ever hurt your baby.<br>  <br>  Russell Turk, ob-gyn and founder of the Riverside Obstetrics & Gynecology in Riverside, CT <br>  <br>  While sleeping on your side (especially the left side) is most commonly recommended, you can also sleep safely on your stomach. The issue of sleep safety during pregnancy generally focuses on optimal blood flow and nutrient supply to the placenta and the fetus. A main concern is the weight of your enlarging uterus pushing down directly on the large veins that return blood to your heart. The most notable effects occur when women lie flat on their back. If you experience such problems as shortness of breath or heartburn, especially in the third trimester, propping yourself up with pillows may be helpful.

C8E3fe3xaa	Yes! You need to go to the hospital asap, dehydration is really bad for baby.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	If you are showing lots of symptoms of dehydration, call your OB. I know I ended up in the hospital to get fluids because I had the same thing going on. If you call your OB maybe they can call in a prescription anti-nausea medication for you that you could get immediately, take, and hopefully keep some fluids down before it gets to the point where you need to be hospitalized. Good luck to you.|`|p3d3E75oaa	you should go to the hospital if you feel like you are dehydrated that's not good and they can give you something to help with the nausea if its that bad that's what they did for my sister, good luck|`|7273c2f9619f41237bda5553ffcdd9ddaa	I am not a nurse but I would suggest you go to the hospital, even to get an IV.  The IV will help keep you hydrated, especially if you cannot keep anything down.  <br>  <br>  They make morning sickness pills or pops, that way help.  You should be starting to get better with the sickness anyway.  Around the 12th week, it should not be as bad, because you will be in the second trimester then.|`|gEtg9LOiaa	You need to go to the doctor dear. I am medical student studying this. Also having a little problem myself. If you dont want to go to the doctor right now then try this. Some saltine crackers as a little snack this will help settle your stomach. Try sipping on some ginger ale or ginger cookies. Also if you cant take the prenatal vitamins then take the smaller ones like a,b,c, and so on so that you have the vitamins that the baby is taking from your body. Also I found a warm bath but not hot bath helped a little and make sure to eat the crackers first thing in the morning. If that doesnt help try some toast. If none of this helps then go to the doctor.|`|PfIywLLyaa	You should call your doctor first, and then proceed to the hospital where they can determine whether or not you need IV fluids.
WWcaKZ7Qaa	You should use either a kaolin-and-pectin- (Kaopectate) or loperamide- (Imodium) type medication if you're having bad diarrhea, because otherwise you could become seriously dehydrated and put your baby at risk. If you get really dehydrated, your blood won't be able to circulate as well to your organs or your placenta, and you'll need to be hospitalized and given intravenous fluids.<br>  <br>  If you have severe or bloody diarrhea, see your healthcare provider right away. An underlying bacterial cause, such as food poisoning, could pose a threat to both you and your baby.<br>  <br>  Taken from the website below, posted by: John Larsen, professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and genetics, the George Washington University, Washington, DC|`|tQPvv0Glaa	Immodium is considered safe by most doctors, but she should check with hers just to be sure.|`|T9SgqPyhaa	I agree with the first answer, also if it is from a stomach bug then try this diet<br>  <br>  Bananas<br>  Rice<br>  Applesauce<br>  Toast<br>  Tea<br>  <br>  This diet is usually recommended for the stomach flu and will help greatly with vomiting and diarrhea if it is stuck to.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	The sheet of medications my doctor gave me lists Kaopectate or Immodium AD
qgglgTcRaa	I have a little brother and a little sister. My brother is 1 and my sister is 2 months. She has recently had an ear infection. We took her to the doctor and she said that her ears would be fine if we claned them out with normal cotton buds. The only thing you have to make sure of it that you don't stick it in too far. The doctor said when babies are little their ear drums can be permantently damaged. We cleaned my sisters and she is fine but it is one of those things you have to have your complete consectration on. I'm sure your little girl will be fine once you clean those little ears out!

by77NPbTaa	Well,<br>  <br>  I can kind of relate to you because i'm 13 and my parents really hate it when they have to talk to me about my bed time too. I think that the best thing you can do is listen to your mom for now. <br>  <br>  I think your mom is telling you to sleep earlier because in the morning, she might be wasting alot of time trying to wake you up instead of doing anything that's important.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, this happens to everyone. It's really not a big deal, just don't fight with your mom or be rude with her because when you go off to college you're going to miss your parents !<br>  <br>  In college you can have ALL the freedom you want so just sit tight and enoy being a kid and getting yelled by your mom for now :)<br>  <br>  HOPE I HELPED DUDE :)|`|AA10152451	She's probably just irritated with you for not getting up.

fc3045470b792b9f04d696b7f2f9cd91aa	If she said more than HPV it could mean that there is a high grade lesion present.  I'm not keen on just how "sure" she can be by doing a colposcopy about whether it's "more" than HPV or not.  They normally would not do a biopsy for herpes, because that can be easily seen on a pap smear. As is the case for CMV.<br>  <br>  What bothers me about this is the fact that your doctor did not talk to you or contact you about any of your results.  That's just totally unprofessional and not fair to you.  I honestly hope you are not dealing with the same doctor who did your colpos and biopsies the first time you were pregnant!<br>  <br>  My take on this is that A) the doctor was totally irresponsible for mentioning that it was more than HPV in front of you while a student was there, that is sooo unprofessional and rude.  B) She wouldn't even know until a pathologist actually looks at the biopsy!<br>  <br>  Just try to keep calm and wait for the results.  Some pregnant women with HPV do tend to have flare ups, but like previous people have said, there are ways to treat it after you deliver your baby that are really effective.|`|v3LnJycKaa	well they also say that when pregnant your cells can appear irregular, and can also change quite a bit, this may be why you seem to get ireegular paps during pregnancy, I would def discuss further with your dr.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	HPV most commonly just causes warts or cervical cell changes.  <br>  <br>  Also sex too close to the test can cause false results.  Yeast infections can cause "abnormal" pap results, etc.<br>  <br>  If it is cancer then you will speak to a specialist.  Different kinds of cervical cancer need different treatments, and treatment can be more or less urgent.<br>  <br>  Also you should know that there is screening available to see if you have one of the strains of HPV that commonly causes cancer.  Also if you live in the US there is a blood test for cervical cancer which is considered more accurate than PAP tests.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=2760" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/defaul...</a><br>  What happens if you are pregnant<br>  <br>  You can have a colposcopy if you are pregnant.  It is perfectly safe for you and your baby, and will not affect the delivery.  It won't affect your ability to get pregnant in future either.  In most cases, any treatment for pre-cancerous cells can be planned for after you've had the baby.  Your doctor will be very careful about taking biopsies.<br>  <br>  Your doctor will not suggest a cone biopsy if you are pregnant unless he or she suspects there is a cervical cancer.  Cone biopsy during pregnancy can weaken the cervix and bring on a miscarriage.  There is more information about the effect cone biopsy might have on future pregnancy in this section of CancerHelp UK.<br>  <br>  ---------------<br>  Tests after an abnormal cervical screening result<br>  <a href="http://www.cancerbackup.org.uk/Aboutcancer/Screening/Cervicalscreening/Furthertests" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancerbackup.org.uk/Aboutcanc...</a><br>  <br>  Colposcopy <br>  <a href="http://www.acog.org/publications/patient_education/bp135.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.acog.org/publications/patient...</a><br>  <br>  --------<br>  Abnormal Pap Smear<br>  <a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/womenshealth/abnormalpapsmear.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanpregnancy.org/womensh...</a><br>  What could cause an abnormal pap smear result?<br>  <br>  An abnormal Pap smear may indicate any of the following:<br>  <br>      * An infection or an inflammation<br>      * Herpes<br>      * Trichomoniasis<br>      * Recent sexual activity<br>      * HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) This is also called genital warts (up to 60% of women may carry this virus on their cervix, genital area, or skin and are completely unaware of it).<br>      * Dysplasia (abnormal cells that can be pre-cancerous)<br>  ---------<br>  <a href="http://www.cwhn.ca/resources/faq/abnormalPap.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cwhn.ca/resources/faq/abnorma...</a><br>  An abnormal Pap test does not mean you have cervical cancer. Approximately four million Pap tests are done every year in Canada. About 8% (over 325,000) have abnormal results. The number of women diagnosed with cancer is around 1400. <br>  <br>   Your test result says | What does this mean? | What usually happens next?<br>  <br>  Unsatisfactory smear | 1. The doctor or nurse practitioner did not take an adequate sample.<br>  <br>  2.

Treatment of dysplasia is usually simple and almost 100 percent effective. It is not even mandatory that it be treated. It is not treated during pregnancy. It need not even be specifically diagnosed during pregnancy. During pregnancy all that need be done is to be assured that there is no invasive cancer present. This can often be accomplished by careful repeat colposcopic examinations, without a biopsy. Mild dysplasia may go away by itself without treatment.<br>  <br>  If a cone biopsy or LEEP were done that had removed the abnormal areas it would be therapeutic as well as diagnostic. Otherwise, the abnormal area can be destroyed by freezing (cryocautery), vaporization (laser), removal by biopsy, cone, LEEP, or even hysterectomy if necessary. Hysterectomy may be best in certain circumstances, but is seldom a medical necessity for dysplasia. If the biopsy shows an invasive cancer then staging procedures need to be done and appropriate treatment given. This is an entirely different problem and will usually require referral to an oncologic specialist.<br>  <br>  Once a premalignant condition has been treated then the woman should be reexamined every three months for at least a year and have a Pap test done. If all goes well then she should be reexamined annually. If the woman was pregnant when the abnormal Pap test was found and examination at that time was not suggestive of cancer then her definitive examination and biopsy can be deferred until six weeks postpartum. <br>  <br>  <br>  ----------<br>  Accurate blood test for the detection of cervical cancer, CSA blood test<br>  <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/27364.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles...</a><br>  <br>  The Cancer That Shouldn't Be<br>  Cervical cancer is almost entirely preventable with a new genetic test.

EVERY BIOPSY, AND EVERY LITTLE THING IS risking your babys life!!!! They are crazy!!!!! You can take care of these things after....IF you still have an abnormal pap...AND YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED to know that it will come back normal! I dealt with this....its will make you worry but, the one thing you should worry about right now is the danger that you are putting on your baby for letting them do a biopsy and any other checking......TRUST ME, They will tell you that its not going to hurt but as soon as something go's wrong they will tell you it was from something else and will never admit to the dangers!!!!!!<br>  WATCH OUT!!!!! Doctors dont know everything!!!!!!!!!|`|PhTKb3JUaa	That happened to me when I had HPV.  I wasn't pregnant, but they explained how it would usually show up then since the immune system isn't as strong then.  The good news, they know it isn't herpes are anything like that.  If it is a form of HPV, it's curable.  I actually had two strands of it and they went away in 4 months on their own.  I now how a lifetime immunity to those two strands.  <br>  <br>  Freezing cells is for a type of HPV, but I'm not sure which kind.  You're worrying too much.  That will kill you.  Breath, and be patient.  I wasted o ton of stress and sleep when mine came up irregular.  Now, I'm perfectly fine and healthy.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ynjgq4GZaa	Several years ago I had an abnormal pap smear and they thought it was cervical dysplasia, which they described as precancerous cells.  They did the colposcopy and biopsy, as they did with you, and in the end they performed the cryosurgery (forgot the exact name) in which they froze the cells.  That kills the cells and they shed, which took about 6 weeks for me (shorter for some women).  After that, I had no problems.<br>  <br>  Now, since you're pregnant, they may not do surgery until after the baby's born.  Obviously your doctor will discuss this with you.  However even if the surgery is delayed, I wouldn't worry about it too much.  It sounds much scarier than it actually is....my doctor told me that (at least in my case) had the cells been left alone, there was a chance I might have developed cervical cancer....about 10 years later.  I don't know what your particular status is but please do try to relax, for the sake of the baby.  Regular pap smears are very effective in catching irregularities very early on, so they can be treated long before there is a problem.<br>  <br>  I hope this is reassuring. :)|`|8Wcqm0iMaa	I had the same thing when I was pregnant.. the results from the biopsy during the colposcopy came back normal. If you dont hear anything, your fine. The next pap smear I had came back normal, and the last one I took (3rd one) came back abnormal and Im going back for another colposcopy tomorrow actually. Obviously they dont know much yet but they said that it could be that I'll have to have more pap smears during the year than usual because it came back. Basically it went "dormant" and didnt show up when my pap smear came back normal and its back again. I would say your probably in the same situation. My nurse also said that it rarely turns into cancer unless you dont get a pap smear for like 5 years or something.. I wouldnt worry too much.

Still I would contact ur doc and let him know how ur doing,
6DNHxcSsaa	It works but one needs to have guidance in using it. Using too much can cause severe diarrhea which can then lead to problems for you and baby.<br>  There has been much debate over whether taking castor oil to induce labor will cause the baby to have its first bowel movement in the womb before birth. This pre-birth bowel movement, called meconium, can be dangerous, because if baby inhales some of it it can cause pneumonia in the lungs. Meconium is also a widely-held signal that the baby is in some sort of distress. Most professionals with any experience with castor oil inductions agree that this is untrue. They have found that there is no increased occurrence of meconium in castor oil induced labors over spontaneous labors.<br>  <br>  The real danger lies in the mother when using castor oil for labor induction. With the severity of the diarrhea, a laboring woman can quickly become dehydrated. Especially in a typically highly managed hospital birth where a woman is allowed few fluids. Dehydration makes one tired and less able to endure through physical activity. Plus, not only does this endanger breastfeeding (proper hydration is necessary to make adequate milk), but a dehydrated uterus is an aggravated uterus, and an aggravated uterus causes more pain for the mother. More pain makes a woman less able to handle natural child birth and puts her and the baby at increased risk for a snowball of interventions.<br>  So yes, there are risks but not as many risks as Cytotec, Pitocin, or artifical rupture of membranes (AROM).|`|ZEYEmYRtaa	Don't do it .. It can be dangerous for your baby.<br>  HE/She will come when they r ready and you will not be left much longer before the Dr's intervene.<br>  I know it is difficult to wait but you wont do your self no good drinking that stuff.<br>  Have a hot curry lol lol xxx<br>  Good Luck and Congrats xx|`|VT24zOomaa	dangerous, it can cause baby to have a bowel movement which can lead to infection!!|`|HbciMmROaa	I took it and it worked within 4 hours..I was a week late and in two days if i didnt go into labor naturally they were going to induce me. A midwife actually told me to try it. My baby came out perfect and I am happy i used it.<br>  <br>  It does cause you to empty your bowls and can be a little painful..but I didnt care cause at that point I was in labor so I was in pain already. and i didnt poop when i delivered her cause i already emptied out my bowls..haha so that was a plus. If i was late again with this pregnancy I would use the castor oil again.|`|6lyvhRLsaa	Its too dangerous. It can make the baby poo itself inside you and that may cause the baby to get sick. I know its horrible when you're overdue, I went 9 days over and I wanted him out. But the baby really will come when its ready. Get some rest while you have the chance. I never thought it'd be so tiring and I regret not resting while I had the chance!<br>  <br>  Congrats on your little one :-)
dNlCfhD2aa	I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it may continue throughout your entire pregnancy.  Sorry!|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I hate to tell you this, but it might not go away. I've had it off and on throughout my pregnancy thus far and I'm 34 weeks along now.|`|fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	Well, it's different with everybody. But as a norm, the morning sickness ends the first time baby moves. Perhaps you were really unable to keep anything down.. so it may linger for longer. But really, morning sickness is about hormones kicking in, and it may last the whole pregnancy. There are some things you can do. There's a prescription supplement of vit B6 that might take the edge off. I had that prescribed and I couldn't take it orally, so they prescribed suppositories and that worked. Go on with the crackers. Eat after you throw up. Some can keep it down if they eat afterward. You really have to find your individual niche. <br>  Congrats, there's not much left!! If it's any comfort, the sicker you get, the better chances you have to bring that baby to term. That means the hormones are present and they'll sustain that baby good.|`|7asbI060aa	I always thought I was having morning sickness too, but then my doctor told me to stop my prenatal vitamins for a few days, and those few days I was completely ok then I started to take them again and I was sick as usual, so I got them switcted and now I'm all good!!<br>  But if it's not that it could last the whole time!!!|`|eHTbY6lhaa	sorry to say it is different for all women. i had sickness morning, noon and night with my first two pregnancy's. i am 22 weeks now with my third and i still get sick sometimes.good luck and congratulations|`|PJBjllsVaa	well with my first pregnancy my sickness didn't go away until my daughter was born so don't count on it going away. sorry
mx3gFmIKaa	I would dismiss it, the woman has no idea what she is talking about.  Average for walking most walk between 10-18 months, this is the normal span for walking, anything earlier is early, anything later is late.<br>  <br>  Walking has absolutely nothing to do with cognitive ability.<br>  <br>  No you should not be worried at all, and I rarely say that, and don't sugar coat anything.|`|2O58btqxaa	don't worry about her there is nothing wrong with your daughter my son was walking at 10 month but that means nothing my friends son is 18 months and hasn't been walking long keep going you will get there and take no notice of that person|`|M6c0hUefaa	While you can't do anything about her legally speaking, you shouldn't be worried about your daughter not walking yet. Some kids don't walk until they're 15 months old..My daughter is 11 months and hasn't even taken a step yet. She will stand up and let go for a few seconds, but I doubt she'll be walking any time soon and I'm okay with that. You shouldn't worry and if there was anything wrong I'm sure your doctor would've noticed. I'm sure she'll be walking before you know it. I just look at it like I'm biding my time waiting and I'm going to enjoy her crawling for now, because once they figure out how to work those feet, there's almost no stopping them. So, don't worry, enjoy the fact that she isn't walking yet and don't let dumb people bother you. They aren't doctors, they don't know her like you do and they probably dont even have kids of their own.|`|lGrcLQ49aa	I would have writen her back and said:<br>  "Of course she is not a genius because we all know that children who walk late have an average high IQ"<br>  <br>  My child all walked around 15-16 months, the older two both have above average IQ's (my 18 yr old has been tested at 150 - very high) My youngest is only 3 so he has not been tested but has displayed some of the same attribute as the other two.  <br>  <br>  Don't worry at what some random idiot has to say - you baby is right on track, if not a bit ahead of the game.  Keep being a good mom.<br>  <br>  Blessings|`|O6DSFJbTaa	Don't worry about it.  My nephew didn't walk until 14 months and he is perfectly normal.  Whoever sent that to you is just a troll.  Your doing a good job.|`|d3gc60wAaa	there is nothin wrong with ur child all children has their moments and soon ur child will b walking all u have to do is b patience|`|7ach0Dz5aa	Nothing to be worried about at all. All kids reach their milestones at different paces. My daughter didn't walk until she was a year and a half and she never crawled at all. But once she was on the move, that was it, running all over the place lol. As for the woman who responded to your ad in that way, she obviously has nothing better to do with her time than to get on people's nerves. Shes probably some "mongoloid" loser. So at least you did your part and reported her but I wouldn't let it get to you!|`|IesX2mWVaa	Hi I'm a mother of 4 kids.  My second is my only daughter.  And she too waited to walk and talk.   All kids develop in their own time.  So don't worry.  She sounds like she is doing fine, if she is talking and connecting with you.  I have a son who has Autism, and his development was very slow.  He talks, and makes some eye contact, but it's not great.  I don't think your daughter has any of these problems, I mention them as I've had a child who has had challenges in his development, to show you I know my stuff.  I do know they have done studies on premature babies, and that they develop at a slower rate then "so called" normal children.  As they often start out smaller, they have to work twice as hard to catch up to their peers.  You say in your question that she is small, and this may be why she is taking her time.  I do know, from many parents I've spoken to who have girls that they do seem to take more time then boys in reaching the known developmental mile stones.  If she were a year and 1/2 and still not walking, I would suggest that you check with you family doctor.  However you said she isn't, so just wait her out.  If she is cruising, using furniture to help her stand then she is doing great.  <br>  Children who have developmental issues will take an average of  six months to a year to reach the same developmental milestones as children who are "so called normal".|`|KNxs4PrZaa	how horrible, i am so sorry that she decided to ruin your day.  your daughter sounds perfectly normal and wonderful, my daughter started walking the week before her first birthday and my niece didnt walk until almost 14 months but was talking up a storm.  your baby sounds right on track.  there is nothing wrong with her, but there is definatly something wrong with a person who would be so cruel and unhelpful about a little baby.  best of luck and dont let her get to you, she is clearly a miserable person.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Oh just delete it, there are crazy people out there who have nothing better to do, you should have read some things people emailed me during the election from the politics section, there are real wackos out there or just bored people.<br>  <br>  And don't worry, my son started walking at 13 months.<br>  <br>  You can always block all email if you don't want any.|`|t3eJ0Y3caa	Don't let this email eat at you! All kids are different and do things at their own natural pace. Your daughter is just fine!  You sound like a great mom, you really do!  My twins, one walked early and one waited. Let me just say, 18 years later, they both are walking just fine!! As far as the woman, she tried to provoke you and don't let her do that.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I'm guessing that e-mail came from someone who doesn't even have kids, lol.  Some people can be soooo rude.  As hard as it is to ignore an insult to your child, just try to and remember that the world is full of ignorant people.  : )|`|Hhifw93laa	that was soooo mean and no don't be worried not un till she is 16 months and showing no sign of walking if she is trying then thats awesome the normal range for walking is between 10 months and 14 months she is normal and not retarted I would of had to cuss some one out for that my daughter is 24 months she did not start to walk till she was 14 months that is why I know about this I have 4 kids and 3 of them walked at 14 months and my youngest is 11 months and not walking but showing a lot of intrest but I hope I helped tell that woman to get real <br>  <br>  God Bless
AA12228565	I have a friend that was suppose to start October 15th.  She took a test December 3rd and it said negative.  Today she is 4 months pregnant.  If you keep getting negatives and you think you might be go and have a blood test done.|`|o4kkU2kSaa	I went to the doctor thinking that I was pregnant because my period was very late and before I went to the doctor I brought 2 pregnancy test and they were both negative and that's when I went to the doctor and the doctor told me that sometimes females could have had a pre-abortion meaning that the baby had aborted it self before even knowing that you are pregnant and they would do something to promote your period to start.|`|jAc7AgOiaa	Either get an expensive test. or make an appointment at a local planned parenthood for a free test.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything.|`|GtEtCliEaa	I'm no medical doctor or anything, but I think you should see a doctor to get his or her take on your situation, sometimes there are other factors that may make you miss your period.|`|4d38b5e779d34e18d56ef4285647b2efaa	Wait a couple of days (a week if you can wait that long) and retest with first morning urine.  I tested negative until 16 days past ovulation cause when I would test I drank a lot of water and I think it diluted my urine.  Or wait four to five hours before peeing on stick. If it's still negative I'd say you're not pregnant but maybe ovulated later in your cycle or not at all. A blood test will tell you a positive before a urine test but my drs office won't give a blood test unless you've tested positive on a urine test. Good luck!
7rCeCVl2aa	You heard this? Any links? I've never heard of this being the up and coming trend in parenting.<br>  <br>  <br>  **Edit** I wasn't going to say anything but a few other did so "WOMEFOLK? WTH? LOL!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I suspect that this is simply more "Americans thinking French men are feminized" B.S.<br>  <br>  Male lactation is extremely rare and for that reason would never be adopted as a widespread cultural practice.<br>  <br>  Also, "womenfolk"?  Really?|`|gPb0s9Ulaa	I think that gynocomastia (the condition where a man is lactating or grows female breasts) is very uncommon.  I have seen stories of men trying to nurse their offspring, but most often these men seek medical treatment and do not try to encourage lactation.<br>  I do not konw whether or not it is more common overseas.|`|tptPX0DJaa	I'm French.  My wife's been pregnant three times, we have two children.  In no way, shape, or form did I start to lactate or anything.<br>  <br>  From what I understand, it's a very rare condition.  It's not like once a woman gets pregnant, a man gets breasts and starts to lactate.  From what I've seen on medical documentaries men seek treatment.  I have never heard of a man trying to breastfeed his baby.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Womenfolk??? Really???<br>  <br>  EDIT: Ok, that's better. "Glorified incubators" is a far more current and accepted expression. Thanks for the update.
b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	I think it's odd too. This is coming from a person who learned to read fluently before school. My mom used flash cards made out of the cards that come from pantyhose, with words written in magic marker and hand-drawn and magazine pictures glued on. We loved them and that's how we learned our words- mom sounded out the words, spent lots of time with us, and praised us, and encouraged us, never forced us, and it was fun. My brother, my sister, and I all learned to read before kindergarten- the old fashioned way! That's not to say that all kids are ready for that or that it's necessary.  <br>  <br>  But a very expensive TV program is not the only way to go. I'm going to save my money.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Totally agree.  Whenever people ask about it I usually discourage the program.  There is no reason a baby can't learn just from day to day interaction, reading books at story times,  and play.  There is no reason to force a program and series of videos and flash cards on a baby.<br>  Its is just ridiculous the expectations of babies now days.  I don't know whats wrong with letting a baby just be a baby!|`|3EhoJ42zaa	I agree.  My kids will be learning the old fashioned way.  I will not be relying on a television to teach them.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? I agree with you, the original way sounds better.|`|qsjGSXaRaa	I see a lot of people bashing the program and I wonder just how many of them have had personal experience with it in order to place negative judgment on it. My guess is that they've only seen the commercials and looked it up online...this gives their opinions no merit, in my opinion. <br>  <br>  I've seen it work firsthand and it's really something! To address your concern about time in front of the television: the baby doesn't sit, "vegging out" alone in front of the T.V. The parent has to be right there, offering visual cues and showing flashcards and such. It's extremely interactive and a great way to spend time with your little one. <br>  <br>  Also, I've seen people bashing it because they feel it doesn't actually teach babies to read, but just helps them to memorize words. My argument to that is that we ALL learn to read by memorizing words! If ever there's a word that I don't know how to spell, I look at the word and my memory is what helps me the next time to recognize it and secondly, to spell it correctly. Without memorization, none of us would be able to read!<br>  <br>  While there are certainly other and less expensive ways to teach your child to read, I don't think that anyone using the program (the way it's intended) can argue that it doesn't work. I know a 20-month old who can read dozens of words out of her little books, and speaks in 3-4 word sentences due to the fact that her mother used this program. <br>  <br>  As for  me, when my baby is old enough, I just may consider using the program too.
9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? I agree, glad I have a choice|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	That is so true, well done for putting things in perspective for those closed minds.|`|faPKwClPaa	I totally agree.  Not only should we be thankful for having that choice, but I think it would do some people a world of good to step back and look at the bigger picture.<br>  <br>  Did you breastfeed or formula feed?  You know what?  It doesn't matter.  What DOES matter is the baby/child is loved, is supported, is given every opportunity in the world to be who they want, etc.  <br>  <br>  When someone achieves something great, no one asks if they were BF or FF -- no one cares.  That didn't make or break them as a human being, and I think that's something people need ot keep in mind.|`|AA11327039	Yes, I agree with you.  I'm so glad we all have choices.  It's sad that we can't just all embrace one another and learn from the choices that those around us makes.  I love learning what people have done and what works for whatever reasons.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	I think you summed it up and worded it very nicely. I agree 100%. <br>  We are all very lucky!!! Thank you for this post!!|`|IlyS8KGzaa	I agree with you whole heartedly.  We are SUPER lucky.  We live in a country where we can have as many children as we want.  Certain countries you can not.  We live in a country where we as woman are allowed to enjoy sex.  Some countries cut the clitoris out of the woman on her 11th birthday because she is not meant to have sex for pleasure, only for breeding.  Crazy right??? <br>  <a href="http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/438/viewall/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/43...</a><br>  FGC, also called female circumcision, is practiced by diverse peoples, including Muslims and Christians, on girls ranging in age from infancy to the late teenage years.1 Specifics of the practice vary more by tribal/cultural affiliation than by national border. FGC is usually a ritual of great cultural significance performed by an older woman in the community. <a href="http://www.notjustskin.org/en/fgc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.notjustskin.org/en/fgc.html</a><br>  <br>  I think sometimes we tend to forget the big picture here, and that is, we as woman in the "free" countries we live in should stand united. No matter how we feed our children, or whether we vaccinate or not, or co sleep, we are free to make those decisions where as some are not.  I think all woman in general ROCK anyways.  We can withstand way more pain than most men even if they can't admit it.  We have the ability to bear children. Most men I know go sleep on the couch the minute a newborn starts to cry, woman can't do that.  We have the ability to "multi task" better than anything else on the planet!  lol!!  We ROCK, and we should tip our hats to one another for a job well done, no matter how we get the job done.  You know?|`|lGcpXteaaa	I agree 100%. <br>  I always feel annoyed by people that jump down peoples throats for their personal choice of parenting...its their flipping choice so why the hell do people get worked up about it??<br>  Nice question hun! <br>  <br>  Oh..the one thing i really disagree with is circumsicion. I would never get at anybody for it, but it still makes me sad to hear it...could you think of a comparison for that? Just to make me feel better about the whole thing? Thanks :)<br>  <br>  Wow..this is such a happy 'get together' moment! tee hee!|`|MMj7YcXkaa	i agree totally.  Its their child, they have their own parenting beliefs and most of the time try not to push my beliefs on others. Some are just not BF material...the same goes for Formula material.  I wish the govt didn't make us have to vaccinate our children.  it should be a choice.  I vaccinated mine but others should be able to make that choice|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Oh I agree completely.  I mean, I feel like anyone who asks questions about formula or bottles gets judged by what I've seen refereed to as the "boobie police".  I mean, I personally used formula.  It doesn't matter what my reasons are, I shouldn't be judged for it.  I honestly feel like it was a blessing from God that I was able to formula feed.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I think we should all just be happy that our children are FED. There are millions of babies (and adults) who die every single day from starvation, and we find it necessary to complain on here that this person said that breastfeeding is gross and that person said formula is poison... There are far more important things to be going on about.|`|A7cZtZFyaa	I agree. I am very proud that I have been sucessful breastfeeding. I am also proud because it was my Choice to do so, and I wasn't forced.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	I feel like holding hands and singing "we are the world" now....|`|x7vTKP24aa	agree|`|AA11988490	I completely agree with you. I don't think women should be judged by the choice they make to breast feed or formula feed their child. As a mother who choose to go the formula route, I have gotten a lot of flack because of it. I don't judge others for breastfeeding, & I don't think its necessarily best. My child is quite intelligent & has always been at the top of %. She is 7 now, and is at the top of her class (which she was in kindergarten @ 4 because she was ready)<br>  But yes, I agree. We shouldn't judge each other because we are very very lucky to be able to have the choices to make.|`|7ee2e58a43d3c7214fd3e8cb1f2c131eaa	I totally agree..I'm glad that I have a choice.I do not think ANYONE should be judged for those kind of choices.Very well said by the way..
KcHhLsCAaa	3  weeks is ok
kaqPSgTVaa	That's a little early to get a symptom. To get a pregnancy related symptom it has to be at least a week PAST implantation. Your body doesn't start producing the pregnancy hormone until implantation has occurred and it takes a while for enough of the pregnancy hormone to build up in your system for you to physically get symptoms.<br>  <br>  Nausea is also not a symptom of implantion. It was most likely unrelated. Good luck though of course you still could be pregnant!|`|v3LnJycKaa	Could be, but could also be PMS symptoms and because you are trying to get preggo your a psyching yourself into seeing more...

hIzQyflqaa	im the same but im 29weeks and sometimes i look massive, other times especially in the morning i look tiny! i had a scan and baby is fine, its all to do with the fact that im dehydrated in the morning, as soon as i have a drink it grows again and by the end of the night it is huge, dont worry yourself!|`|MtC3CWZraa	This is going to happen based on fluid retention, what's in your bowels and stomach, and as the baby gets bigger, his/her position.

6359becf9ea83832470afde520533f08aa	Its hard at first. It will get easier. I lost my grandfather whom I was really close with back in 1993. He was more like a father to me then a grandfather. I still think about him often. You are always going to hurt but it does get easier. Just take things slowly. It will all fall into place. I'm really sorry for your loss.|`|OtbbKdITaa	My cousin died suddenly and unexpectedly when my daughter was only 2 months old. My cousin and I were very close, but the life she choose caused her to never see my daughter. When she died, I wanted to close myself up in a room so I could be alone and cry for her without worrying about responsibility. However, my daughter wouldn't let me do that. What kept me going was to remember that my cousin wouldn't want my daughter to be neglected so I could mourn her. <br>  <br>  Take care of your body. Make sure you're eating and resting. Please try not to get yourself too upset right now. Your unborn child needs you to take care of yourself, and that's what your grandfather wants, too. He wants his great-grandchild to be as healthy as possible.<br>  <br>  I'm so sorry for your loss. Keep your chin up.|`|GEfpzUNvaa	i know its hard but you of all people right now being pregnant have to keep yourself calm and healthy.. keep eating properly and what not.. and if you really think it will help talk to someone about it.. not just on here but to a counselor.. believe it or not they do help.. i lost a baby at 19 weeks in my pregnancy and it was the hardest thing ever and the one thing that helped was talking to a counselor about it.. so i hope this helps you out.. just remember life will take its course and it is very hard.. keep tlaking to people and just tyr to smile.. good luck|`|QQUZRXa3aa	think of it this way, your grandfather passed, but a new life is forming! talk to the people that are close to you and keep your mind on the pregnancy. good luck!|`|qamxVrV5aa	well I understand how you feel but the only think I can tell you is to think about you child. Stress is not good for the unborn baby. The only think you can think of is you and you child being that close. Think of it as you lost someone close to you only to gain another one that will be closer|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	they are happy for you and watching you and yours|`|f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	I'm so sorry for your loss. My father passed away 2.5 years ago and it was still hard on me when I found out I was pregnant. The only advice I can give is to stay positive. Your grandfather would have been so happy that he was going to be a great grandfather and he would not want you to be sad about him, but happy about bringing another life into this world. Good Luck and if you would like to talk, you can send me an email. Take care!
UZRNLFz4aa	DONT DO IT!! use nuvaring, trust me...i know... ._.|`|YlLmAADraa	DON'T TAKE YAZ!!<br>  <br>  i know ALOT of people who got pregnant taking that pill. its not effective and actually Dr's even say that you should not take YAZ.|`|RyEfiuOGaa	I know it causes early chemical abortions...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://prolife.com/BIRTHCNT.html" rel="nofollow">http://prolife.com/BIRTHCNT.html</a>|`|6359becf9ea83832470afde520533f08aa	60 to 70 for a months worth. That's with out insurance
bsFOgh9daa	Girl that's rape.you said no you meant no. again no is no. So yes I WOULD TELL YOUR DAD OR TELL SOMEONE YOU TRUST. What he did was wrong and he will do it again to some one else until you stop him. I do not care if you ended up having sex you said no that is forced sex. You are a not to blame your self. He was so wrong and he needs help. If you are over 14 you can go to the doctors with out your parent and tell them and see if you are pregant at the same time tell them what had happen to you, You said no. and it did not stop there. I know you are scared that normal. I know you are worried what he is going to think. Wait he did not care what you thought so why are you careing what he would think now. Stand up for your self now with the help you need I know when he was forcing you to have sex you had to of  been so scared. I am sorry you did not deserve that at all. Tell some one you trust that's older than you so the right help will come your way. I AM SO SORRY THAT HAD TO HAPPEN TO YOU.|`|AXUeymRDaa	How long ago was it if it was less than 3 days ago then take the morning after pill and get checked for any sexually transmitted diseases!<br>  <br>  sorry for what he did to you he's a ****!!!|`|RoTLnFGZaa	You need to take a pregnancy test,<br>  and if you're pregnant- you have to tell your parents.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Regardless of verbally consenting, you are not the 'Age of Consent'.  So that was Statutory Rape on the guy's part.<br>  <br>  Tell your father so, he will get the law after the kid.|`|uXbl1Zbhaa	Sorry to tell you this but if you're old enough to play you're old enough to suffer the consequences.  In your case - possibly being pregnant at 15.  Two days late?  It might be just stress.  That will make a girl late.  Normally not a big deal.  You should have been more persistent and not given in.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	if your late u can go ahead and take a test do that be for u go getting your self all stressed out because stress can stop u getting your period to|`|115BfzMFaa	If you live in the uk this is called stratuory (( sorry, can't spell it )) rape. As he is 16, and  that is the legal age limit to have sex, and you are 15. Also it could be rape as you did not want it and he forced you to have it. Tell your parents and get this a** of a guy done. He was wrong for doing this to you!|`|7uVlYPEIaa	If you are two days late then yes you can take a test, and I would take it soon if I were you. Stress can put off a period too, for your peace of mind take a pregnancy test to let you know what direction you need to head in. Your father is not going to stop liking you because you had sex. What that boy did was rape. You said no and asked him to leave twice. He then forced himself on your to intimidate you. I suggest talking to a counselor at school if you feel you cannot talk to your father or other close adult. I also suggest staying away from that boy and maybe staying away from parties or situations, like having someone in when your parents are not home. He knew what he was doing even if you think he wasn't just trying to get sex from you.
Fd4lITkvaa	The most important thing to do is listen to your body. There is no need to stuff yourself to gain weight. Losing 3lbs in the first trimester is ok, if you continue to lose or were underweight I would be worried. Starting in the second trimester you should see a slow weight gain, only .5-1lb a week is just fine. You do need protein and plenty of it. This can be from cheese, beans, meat, eggs, fish, milk, or nuts. Try to get a bit of protein in at every meal and you will be fine. Your doctor shouldn't be too focused on the scale, it's fairly common to lose a few pounds in the first trimester. I lost 6lbs and ended up gaining 42lbs in the end. It does catch up with you and your body will make sure you gain what you need if you listen to it. Eat when you are hungry and I truly believe that cravings are a sign that your body needs something in what you are craving so give in to them in moderation.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	You need to eat a well balanced diet and make sure you don't eat low fat cheese or yogurts as your baby does need the fats to grow. You shouldn't way overeat and take eating for 2 to the extreme, but you do need to eat and eat enough to nourish the baby. You should have a well rounded 2,000 calorie diet for yourself, included all the required food groups as well as an additional 300 calories per day for your baby.|`|Ed7qNFdzaa	eating a proper diet which includes protein is not 'hording' food.<br>  <br>  you need to eat more than rabbit food when you are pregnant. <br>  <br>  i think you have some misconceptions about what 'healthy' food it...its NOT just salads and veggies.<br>  <br>  you need to at least eat some eggs and chicken and while i only seemed to crave "lighter" foods in the beginning of this pregnancy...i forced myself to eat proteins too, cuz the baby AND my body needs them.|`|3w7VztEWaa	You can't go wrong with healthy foods.<br>  Just think what you eats goes into the babie how can processed sugery high fat foods be good for you child?<br>  but you do need a well planned diet that will give you all everything you an the baby need.|`|WtTUNC8Naa	During pregnancy, you need all the calories you usually eat, plus a little more. Since every mouthful you eat is helping your baby grow, eat smart. You should eat at least five fruits and vegetables a day, and six to eight servings of breads, cereals or grains.<br>  <br>  Calcium <br>  Calcium helps build bones--for you and your baby. Drink plenty of milk and eat yogurt, cheeses and some leafy green vegetables like broccoli and kale. <br>  <br>  Folate<br>  This nutrient comes from citrus fruits, dark green leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts and whole grains. Enough of this vitamin may even prevent birth defects in the first trimester. <br>  <br>  Iron<br>  You'll need plenty of iron for your own increased blood supply, as well as the baby's. Good sources of iron include lean meats, dark green leafy vegetables, prunes, dried fruits, beans, whole grains and enriched grains. Not enough iron might mean you could become anemic. <br>  <br>  Protein<br>  Choose lean meats (round, sirloin), fish, poultry, many dairy foods, dry beans, seeds, soy products, eggs or egg substitute and nuts for high protein. Protein makes up every cell of your growing baby's body. You need about 70 to 90 grams of protein a day. <br>  <br>  Water<br>  You need more fluids now for your increasing blood supply--at least six to eight glasses a day. You can substitute some juice, milk or soup, but not coffee or tea or other drinks with caffeine. If you do, drink one glass of water for every cup of coffee or tea to balance out.<br>  <br>  Food cravings and pica<br>  When pregnant, some women notice cravings for certain types of foods. On rare occasions, a woman may have a strange desire to eat clay, chalk, cornstarch and other inappropriate substances. These unusual cravings are called pica. Don't give in to them! <br>  <br>  Caffeine<br>  Caffeine has been linked to everything from fast heart rates to insomnia. But there is also concern about what caffeine can do to your developing baby. In fact, a recent study linked a high caffeine intake during pregnancy to sudden infant death syndrome. Be smart--one glass of coffee or tea or caffeinated soda should be your limit, if you must have it at all. Remember, chocolate and some medications also contain caffeine.<br>  <br>  Shellfish<br>  Oysters, clams, scallops--these tasty delicacies are some of nature's hardest working filters. Shellfish filter large amounts of water through their bodies. As a result, any toxic materials in the water can collect in shellfish at high levels. To be safe, avoid shellfish while you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  Soft cheeses<br>  If you are pregnant, avoid soft cheeses, such as feta, mozzarella, Brie, blue-veined cheeses like Roquefort and Mexican-style cheeses such as queso blanco, queso fresco, queso de hoja or asadero. These cheeses can become contaminated with bacteria called Listeria. You can't tell by smell, sight or taste if the cheese is contaminated. Call your health care provider if you experience symptoms that include nausea, fever and chills or vomiting. Heat kills these germs, but they survive in the freezer and thrive in the refrigerator. Eat only pasteurized dairy products and choose hard cheeses like cheddar while you are pregnant. <br>  <br>  Sometimes the list of DON'T DOs during pregnancy can seem a bit overwhelming. Remember, moderation is key!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ynhh.com/maternity/healthy/eating.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ynhh.com/maternity/healthy/ea...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  here is another really good website:<br>  <a href="http://www.4woman.gov/pregnancy/pregnancy/eatresources.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.4woman.gov/pregnancy/pregnanc...</a>
FsiG5WtQaa	Its cute, I like Jaeden Isabella. <br>  I just hope Jayden isn't the next brittney or ashley. Meaning, I hope it doesn't become too popular of a name.<br>  It's still really cute tho!|`|61NKzPzMaa	Jayden/Jaeden/Jadyn are trashy spellings of the BOYS name Jaden.<br>  <br>  Isabella is pretty but overused.|`|vQVAZM66aa	Jaeden Isabella sounds interesting :]|`|aJZ4oGMKaa	I love the spelling Jayden the others ones are way too over the top|`|FpwRrOwxaa	I love that baby girl name!<br>  I think you should spell it Jayden Isabella.|`|u7o75zipaa	Jayden is a very masculine name to me.<br>  What about Jade/Jayde?<br>  Jade Isabella/Jayde Isabella?<br>  Sounds nice to me :) x|`|ZPxmuy2Naa	I like Jayden Isabella .|`|MSGixNibaa	The name Jaden is masculine and not at all suiting on a little girl, no matter how you spell it or try to frill it up with feminine middle names. <br>  Does Chrystopher Maria sound right to you? That's the same amount of awkwardness you find in Jayden Isabella<br>  <br>  The name Jaden is a common misspelling of the Biblical name 'Jadon' which has become increasingly popular these days.<br>  <br>   I know a teenage mother who named her son Jayden and said, "I really regret it now. I didn't do any research and just named him Jayden because I thought it was cute, I didn't realize how popular it was. He's going to have a really popular name just like I do and I'm sorry for it." I felt really awful for her. She says she'd never have him go by his middle name because he's already used to Jayden. Poor kid. ):<br>  <br>  Isabella Jade would be an incredible improvement, although Isabella itself is still very, very common. At least then the name would be feminine and correctly spelled.<br>  <br>  Jasmine Isobel would be a huge step up as well.|`|E8kzNG3iaa	I really like Jaiden Isabella.<br>  <br>  but of the spellings you listed, I prefer it spelled Jayden|`|AA10972366	Jayden Isabella|`|3K7ffKn2aa	Jadyn Isabella i like that one
aLajoXnRaa	Just tell her. at first she will be upset of course but with time hopefully she'll get over it. and when i mean time i mean like later on when you already had the baby and everything. but its best to jst be straight up with her, and if shes mad jst reason with her. its a motherly thing i guess.<br>  i had the same situation and it was hard but i told my mom, it was better than keeping it from her til' it was noticeable|`|fMXaNyWQaa	no offense but all i have to say is pple like you make me believe that this genration is not going to go far!<br>  EDUCATION SHOULD BE YOUR FIRST PRIORITY!<br>  BTW IM 13 !|`|j4lcMGmiaa	Just tell her...she is going to be upset no matter what you say or do...so just spit it out...the only thing you have to make sure is that you don't tell her when you are angry because its not going to be worse for you if you are.|`|TR91FM5Faa	Say "mom, I'm pregnant" she's gona figure it out when your belly gets all big|`|Di7KqbVQaa	LOL.<br>  <br>  Even if he wasnt going to jail, he sure would be now!<br>  <br>  You need to get it out in the open and tell her, tell her first off whats happened with the guy, and that you appreciate that she will be disappointed that you got involved with him.Tell her about the pregnancy - you are very young and you need to understand that pregnancy is not easy- you have a 1 in 4 chance of miscarriage, which to you, may not seem much, but its highly common. Could you be prepared for that? Could you cope with a child if it got sick? You cant expect your mother to do it all - she did her bit when she choose to have you.<br>  <br>  Sounds quite harsh, but its the grim reality of it all. You'll miss out on your late teen years, which are normally the best.|`|nFW8QeBsaa	Write a letter, and to the idiot that said have an abortion. Dont listen to them, it is not the babys fault you made a bad decision, at the end of the day you will be the only one to take care of it.|`|BfKKNqo3aa	email it to her if you cant tell her face to face, its easier like that, once she has read the email it will be best to talk to her ASAP to get your choices straight.|`|c8URWkq1aa	tell her and get an abortion<br>  x
AA12197561	If you have sex protected or un - protected theres always a chance of being pregnent. <br>  even tho protected theres a 99.9% chance of not getting pregnant. <br>  <br>   but I would say give it some time. Or get a pregnancy check?|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? There is a possibility any time you have unprotected sex. Take a test and find out. If your not pg, and your not wanting a baby at this time, then please use protection.|`|5cd52d24c5f7667ec458aba89c056f19aa	i'd say give it time and then take a home pregnancy test.  if it comes back negative and you still don't get your period, call your dr.|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I would just go into my docs office and get a blood test done.|`|sFdn9hIkaa	The fact that your period was shorter than usual shouldn't be a concern to you. Be happy you got it, this probably means you aren't pregnant! If you think about being pregnant too much it can really stress you out and sometimes that affects your body. Maybe that's why you've lost appetite. <br>  <br>  Try not to worry about it for the coming 2 weeks, and after 2 weeks take a test just to be sure. And the unprotected sex - this is exactly why it's not worth it, cause the girl will always sit and wonder if she's pregnant and unfortunately, the chances that you are pregnant when you have unprotected sex aren't small.
rFRo6DGTaa	Haha..I just experienced this about a half hour ago, my daughter is 6 months and I have been having problems with her wondering eyes while feeding, it makes it really messy and hard to feed. I don't know if this is the best thing to do but I put her highchair in front of the T.V and she watch mickey mouse while i feed her, she wasn't looking  at me but it stopped her checking everything out.  And just because our babies are looking around I don't think it means that there not hungry,  babies are just easily distracted, maybe this is just something that we have to deal with until they get older ( I hope not). good luck!|`|0zhPDe4zaa	Infants just do that kind of thing. They do not necessarily need solid food at 6 months old (unless told otherwise by a doctor) just the milk will give them all the nutrition they need. The main point at 6 months to start eating cereal and such is to just get them slowly ready to start solid food all the time at a year or a little later if you wish. they need to be able to handle swallowing the food. thats why it always starts out runny and close to a year they end up eating pretty thick foods. my 7 month old daughter used to eat ANY time i gave her cereal or baby foods but recently she has started to lose interest. babies are so curious and they find a lot of new and interesting things every day! so i just dont push it. if she doesnt pay it any attention when i try a few times we get out of the high chair and try again in an hour. if still not interested, we wait till next meal (ex from lunch to dinner). She only is offered cereal at breakfast, baby foods at lunch and dinner, and maybe a mum-mum somewhere through the day it she is trying to put everything in her mouth. any time she is eating (besides when i nurse her or give her formula) she always has to sit in her highchair. even for mum-mums. i also always offer her juice at the highchair every time. all of this sets up for good practice of having 3 meals a day at the table. just wanted to give you some ideas as your daughter eats more solids. anyway back to your question though like i said my daughter loses interest most of the time too but I dont get too worked up if she doesnt eat when i put her in her highchair and offer her baby food or cereal. just dont let them sit there a long time playing with a toy or something because it could confuse them. If you just think 'highchair is for meal times' then your daughter will understand that too and be more apt to eating when placed in the highchair. And dont worry, she will gain more focus on her food once she actually wants more than her milk is giving her. Its instinct. She knows its food so once she needs more than just milk she will want it. I hope this helps and good luck with your daughter :)|`|vue9NOhYaa	Remember the mantra -- if she's hungry, she will eat.<br>  <br>  If she's distracted and uninterested, she isn't hungry.  If she isn't hungry, she doesn't need to be eating.  So put the bowl away and let her down from her high chair.  Or, maybe she just doesn't like rice cereal. She doesn't need it, so don't force it.  Try a different food (peas, peaches, chicken) and see if that's more interesting for her.  Solids ARE just for fun, so whatever she enjoys is fine.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	My 5 month old does the same thing.  He has a big sis that captivates him.  If she's not around it's something else.  It's just the age.  Not much can be done about it.  Even my 2 year old gets distracted easily.  Sometimes it takes forever for her to finish a meal.|`|ZR7Fgerlaa	Sounds like a normal 6 month old to me.  If It's breakfast time and she's doing that, try to keep her attention.  Do the airplane thing "here comes the airplane!!!" with the spoon, or just give her a spoonful, let her look around a little, then call her name again to get her attention and feed her another one.  It's normal for them to be looking all over the place.  ESPECIALLY if the high-chair is a new experience.  If she keeps turning her head away from a spoonful of cereal, though, she's probably not hungry.  Babies don't usually start to pay attention to meal-time until they have the option to feed themselves, anyhow.|`|e9kvxIc3aa	If she's hungry, she'll focus...She's just checking out the world....relax and enjoy it with her!|`|UpRdvpmXaa	Try entertaining her while she eats her cereal. Funny but my 7 month old nephew enjoys hearing people growl before they put the spoon in his mouth...funny kid. He growls too...makes for some cute videos.|`|kjcybCOvaa	its normal for babys to look around and be curious at all things lol dont stress it.
rC6gL7KOaa	You can test today.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	You can take a test as soon as you miss your period, or up to 5 days before your missed period if you get a First Response.|`|AA12362903	It sounds like you may have conceived but if I were you I'd wait at least a couple days to take a test.  I never had luck with the ones that say you can test the day after your period is due.  I had a few false negatives when I was actually pregnant.  Good luck!!|`|SfludeD5aa	Take one today. Most test can detect pregnancy by the first day of your missed period, buy the two pack so if it comes out negative you can take the other one in a couple of days if you don't start your period. You don't have to buy the expensive test either when me and my hubby was trying to get pregnant I used the dollar store test and it showed I was pregnant on the day I was supposed to start my period.|`|xpstigPTaa	sounds like its a good chance that your pregnant. If you have already missed your period, go ahead and test! If you get a negative and still no AF in a few days, re-test again!!! Good luck!!!
pRpUBJDzaa	well my questions are somtimes to embarsing to ask to a doctor or family ect<br>  <br>  so i come on here and ask some|`|zBz10IiOaa	well i am 6 months pregnant i like to see the questions that people ask maybe i can help,or there are people asking questions that i never thought to ask and i like to read the answers i can't work anywho the hubby say's no he spoils me and i also do it to pass the time and you?|`|mVD3TQkFaa	Because I like to get answers form real life people that have been through pregnancy and parenting instead of books and websites for my answers. I just ignore that rude people they are just looking for attention. Also I enjoy helping people with my answers.|`|5cd52d24c5f7667ec458aba89c056f19aa	Sometimes it gives me a good laugh to see some of the questions.  Also, there is a lot of good information on here...and finally.. it helps pass the time while I'm at work since myspace is blocked.|`|1K0n0Sk8aa	because i ignore the rude ones and get good advice off the polite ones|`|4p9sBdyTaa	Boredom|`|Rt6ajbqoaa	it feels great to help out others with things you know about and its great to different opionions on your own issues|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Well, even though there are a lot of rude answers, there are people on here who actually give good responses and can give some insight into situations. I just ignore the people who are rude. :]|`|em8A42Bqaa	You're right. they can sometimes be rude, but its all in the question you ask.  Just dont take it to hard and remember that its just an opinion and if you dont like it give them a thumbs down! :)|`|AA11828121	The rude answers usually come from people who are bitter or on here to pass time, i've also noticed rude answers are given to questions that one may think are ignorant. I've asked several questions on here and not once have I received a rude response. The other positive is that there are many pregnant women on here and many who have had children which means I will have a bigger range of answers than just asking my few friends and doctor.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	Sure, some people are rude, but others are pretty nice, and can be really helpful. I use Y!A to ease my mind about things that I'm not sure are normal during pregnancy. Hearing other women's experiences is both comforting and informative--it lets me know when I'm being paranoid, and when there really is cause for alarm. And it's nice getting to hear other women's cravings, funny stories, weight gain, etc etc etc... <br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope you start running into nicer people on here!!|`|KdqaGnlwaa	Its better than myspace... lol... It helps time pass by faster and sometimes the questions asked here are things that I am wondering myself.|`|VT24zOomaa	because i don't have that many people in my life that have pregnancy experience. so why not ask people who've gone through it??
3EhoJ42zaa	With my first pregnancy I had no morning sickness, my baby's heartrate was always between 166-168.  Felt great throughout the majority of the pregnancy. <br>  <br>  With my second pregnancy I had morning sickness, lost 10lbs in the first trimester, felt awful, had really bad round ligament pain, the heartrate was always between 135-140.<br>  <br>  Both are boys.|`|Do7HCN8vaa	i was told during my pregnancy that a girls normally have a faster heart rate. But of course there are always exceptions to the rules.
lCxcfisfaa	I had an interesting idea ... but my husband ruined it by showing up before I even got home!<br>  <br>  I was going to send him on a scavenger hunt. I wrote the clue's with a sexy undertone so that he wouldn't suspect baby at all. The last clue told him to look under my clothes for his reward. I had the Dr. write "congrats daddy" on my belly with my due date. However, she wrote it waaaaaay too small and sloppy so I was going to re-write it when I got home.<br>  <br>  However, I came home and he was already there. So, I took a onesie I got for an extra visual reminder a baby was on the way and wrote "Congrats Daddy" and gave it to him before dinner.|`|hmOidFp3aa	Hey!

cJRFbZUaaa	You can take a pregnancy test to be certain.  Your description of the period being normal for about two days sounds reassurring, though.  You might also have a bladder infection causing the discharge on the toilet paper; your doctor can test your urine for this.
90zcKChJaa	I'm 14 weeks in and I have been craving potatoes and hot wing sauce. (not the wing, but only that orange sauce) MMMmm..|`|SpcYCBndaa	m&M's peanut|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I've had tons!

In the middle I had a craving for burritos, the ones you get at the deli. Now at 31 weeks, fruit - grapes and strawberries.|`|d6dzoHvvaa	My biggest craving so far have been pickles. I have to have one with lunch every day and also I love spicy foods!|`|dn2UCOkqaa	Homeade chicken noodle soup<br>  Hot wings<br>  Pickles|`|6PEOqeLOaa	ice cream, Chinese food i really miss subs but since i can't eat deli meat i won't have them till after im done being pregnant, fruit, chicken noodle soup|`|IhZeoXqvaa	Pickles tend to be one of the most common; however, I also craved beef jerky.

27619df890eb68d8ffaf95f7eb7644e0aa	first of all Congratulations!!!! Welcome to the joys and PAINS of pregnancy :-) I have that same tail bone pain, my doctor tells me that its the pressure of the baby on your tailbone, which makes it rub your lower back, which causes some pain. I have the same thing going on right now. I have had it for quite a few weeks, and it is normal. I am 25 weeks 4 days today, and i use heating pads, and make my hunny give me lots of lower back massages. It seems to help temp, also try a firmer bed, i did get one and that helped wonders. Good Luck.|`|F9pAWBG9aa	i have had tailbone pain all thru my pregnancy.... try not sitting for too long and walking slowly the first few steps and it might be more comfortable to waddle (your prego its expected haha) but mine has lasted all thru my pregnancy (35 weeks 3 days prego)
Fkl6gV8Qaa	It's normal. My pediatrician (the same one who did the circumcision) recommended that after his bath I push it back a little. At first I felt weird doing this but I did it anyways. It will eventually take care of itself though. No need to make a doctors appointment just for that, just ask at your next one. Our pediatrician always checked it at my son's appointments.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	My son is the same way, I pull the skin back (gently) and apply vaseline. He's 7 months old and we are still doing it. The pediatrician said its normal and they he will grow into it at about 2 years old. Just make sure you pull back to clean and apply the vaseline so it doesn't become reattached, that would be very painful for the baby.|`|EZQIOIxxaa	The same thing happens to my son. I think once he gets older it will sort itself out.|`|BnOrf9nGaa	Wait.  It's normal.  When he gets bigger it will even itself out.  My godson is 5 now, and he was the same way.
o9u4H6m6aa	This is an interesting question. I know there are a lot of people and caregivers who would not be comfortable waiting beyond 42 weeks for labor to start naturally, but let's consider the research.<br>  <br>  The 42 week theoretical cut off point is based on one study done in 1958.<br>  The risk is that after a certain point, the placenta becomes less efficient.<br>  The chance of that happening goes up slightly ON AVERAGE at about 42 weeks. again that is just the average. It doesn't happen at the same time for every pregnancy.<br>  <br>  There are other factors to look into. <br>  1. Is the dating accurate? Many pregnancies may not be accurately dated. For eg, if the menstrual cycle is not regular, or if it is a lot longer than 28 days. There are some cases of babies who were thought to be 40 weeks and were induced. But when they were born, they were only at 37 weeks by development. Inducing before a baby is developmentally ready can of course cause problems of prematurity.<br>  <br>  2. Is baby currently showing signs of stress? Women who want to wait past 42 weeks can have the option of having frequent checks of baby's heart rates to make sure that it is not feeling stressed. It shows signs of stress in it's heart beat when it is not getting enough oxygen. So if the placenta is getting less efficient, baby will show signs of stress.<br>  If baby is fine, then there may be no reason to induce.<br>  <br>  Just wondering, which country are you in? <br>  <br>  Other things to consider are, trying natural methods of starting labor.<br>  There are many ways. You could probably find a lot by doing a google search.<br>  Long walks, hip rotations on an exercise ball, sex, nipple stimulation, kissing etc,  visualization, herbal methods, chiropractic, and so on....<br>  Also, how are you feeling emotionally? If you are feeling anxious or not ready, that can produce hormones that inhibit labor.<br>  Relaxing, talking to your baby, clearing up anything that is making you feel not ready can definitely help. Breathe and get grounded. Go for a walk in nature. Tune in to your body and your baby. Read other inspiring birth stories. Enjoy the time!<br>  <br>  If you are feeling contractions, that's a good sign. <br>  All the best!|`|28QPS6V9aa	It's fine but you need to consider the fact that waiting has some risks. You risk your baby being too big to fit through your pelvic bones which would cause you to have an emergency c-section. You also risk your baby having meconium and getting an infection. If you don't want to be induced, that's fine just remember you're taking a risk. My friend was seventeen days overdue and ended up having to get an emergency c-section because her baby was too big to come out naturally. She wishes she would have been induced.|`|S6QpB8QZaa	I was nearly 43 weeks when they induced me (army hospital during a baby boom). I would go back to the doctor because I started having a lot of problems myself not to mention my son weighed in at 10lbs 2 ozs. I don't want to scare you and I am sure neither does anyone else but your body needs help and you probably wont go into labor naturally. Call your doctor!|`|9ro8fiKvaa	I am assuming that this is your first baby ... otherwise you would have already made the correlation between a larger child and a more difficult delivery ... Unless you are one of those freakish women who can just spit 'em out I strongly suggest you ask your Dr what he/she is smoking by not having made an appointment for C-section or an induction. <br>  P.S. Take the damned drugs!!!! Induction labour comes on soooo strongly and quickly!|`|2n0B4cY6aa	Your baby would be in danger.<br>  In uk,you only go over by 2 weeks then doctors bring on labour to get baby out.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I find it very odd your doctor would even let you go 3wks over due....|`|MtC3CWZraa	Dear god, yes! What kind of doctor is letting you go that long? The placenta starts breaking down after 42 weeks so the baby will literally not get adequate nutrition and oxegent. I can't tell you the last time I heard of a doc letting someone go beyond 41.|`|v3LnJycKaa	after 42 weeks the placenta starts to deteriorate and not deliever as much oxygen and nuterients to your baby, it can become a very bad situation relatively wuickly, I suggest you have an induction scheduled soon, you may only need a small kick in the pants (some cervidil etc..) to get it started.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	You shouldn't have been allowed to go past 2 weeks overdue. Once you get that far along the placenta deteriorates and it's unsafe to carry your baby. <br>  <br>  Go to the ER.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	Your doctors shouldn't let you go over 2 weeks over due. You probably should call them and schedule an appointment to be seen. They might want to schedule you for a C Section|`|dDVAUA9saa	Most doctors will only let you go two weeks past your due date, then induce.
vQ8XPXsdaa	It is a beautiful name! I know a little girl named Alexa and she is so sweet.|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	I don't like it.  There are way to many Alexa, Alexia, and Alexis girls out there.  I know 3 Alexa's and 1 is in gymnastics and is preppy and 1 I don't know that well and the other is a baby so I don't know.  I know 2 girls with the name Alexis and both are overly preppy (almost snotty).|`|AA12370001	Its a great name for a girl.<br>  <br>  Not sure why you would think certain people act based on their name.  Thats probably the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard.  Behavoir is based what they see and what they mimic, and ultimately what they think is right and wrong.  Doesn't matter if their name is alexa, emily, rachel, donna, etc.|`|v6DRUwH7aa	My absolute favorite girl's name is Alexandra nn Alexa!  It's a very beautiful, feminine, & classic name!  Love the meaning behind the name as well - "Defender of the people".  I envision a beautiful female that has long dark hair with either blue or green eyes, an honest and noble person who is highly educated, the most kind hearted, friendly, and fun individual who loves her family.|`|9f3784bdf3bdc20b62d4d53dedacfdfeaa	Great name!  I have only met a few and always had a good impression of them.  Sounds professional too, great on a resume or application|`|16bWGB14aa	Alexa is a pretty name.|`|fh6TgqENaa	Alexa is a beautiful name! I know a girl named Alexa, actually it is Alexarae but everyone calles her Alexa, and she is Beautiful, very friendly, liked by many, and a great friend to have! Her middle name is Alexarae Nikolette. Alexa Nikolette is nice too!|`|ln0wLqZhaa	I LOVE THE NAME ALEXA <br>  <br>  I havn't known to many people named alexa but they all seem very sweet when i meet one and very pretty :)|`|wuqJZUauaa	I have a cousin named Alexa. It's a great name, and it isn't that common.|`|36e3fa7f42e78d18eb4c4017853f2865aa	I think is nice, as long that you dont change your mind and decide to name her alexandra .|`|eJMIazhLaa	Cute.  I like Alexis better.
ncUhlwevaa	I am not a pregnancy test, therefor, I cannot tell you if you are pregnant.|`|IhZeoXqvaa	Until you take a test, you cannot know for sure.  Pregnancy does not only depend upon your most fertile days, but your partner's sperm count as well as many other factors.  The odds of you being pregnant may be higher; however, until you pee on that stick, you cannot be certain.|`|WbaSpiYpaa	Honestly, not to be rude, but are you for real?  You are talking about last week, not a month ago, and you won't know for sure for at least a couple of weeks.  Take a pregnancy test then.
Q05rrSX4aa	Honestly it sounds like your period is here, or just starting.  The pregnancy tests should show + by now since you are so far in your cycle.  However a blood test from your doctor would confirm it for sure.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You could be pregnant but you could also be having a miscarriage. I would assume though that your period was just late and now it's light. If you still think you're pregnant then make a visit to your doctor and get a blood test. Good luck!|`|7BaHGMEyaa	search on google pregnancy symptoms.<br>  they mostly include<br>  missing period,headaches,being sick, getting tired.<br>  but it varies for different women, to be on the safe side go to your doctor and ask for a test.<br>  good luck!|`|d96SSlrIaa	You may have to go to the clinic to take a blood test because it may not be in your urine yet that's what I had to do .|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Well, if you've been having sex, then yea, it's possible.  However, having a period, even if it's light, is a good indicator you're not pregnant.  HPT's can be wrong sometimes, but if you're getting your period and multiple negative HPT's, then you're probably not pregnant.|`|UaL28atDaa	Here is something you should watch that will let you know what symtoms to expect from the first couple of weeks of pregnancy it may give you a better idea of what to look out for. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/video/watch/100090/Pregnancy_Weeks_1_to_4?YAFT" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/...</a> <br>  <br>  Good Luck
KOwzDLPdaa	How magical.|`|21LiTNVsaa	You need to talk to your parents asap because if you are going to keep the baby you need to start taking prenatal vitamins right away. you should also talk to your bf so that you two can decide what you are going to do about the baby. You may be worried about your parents, but they are the people who love you the most in this world and will help you through it. you also need to make a DR appointment to get a blood test to make sure you are for sure pregnant, and then to see your OB at 10-11 weeks. good luck!|`|cQoNzj5Gaa	Oh, well don''t have sex in this 9 month period at least.|`|173kXTiCaa	you should have thought about that the only thing to do now is tell them|`|kP3Ryfyuaa	you need to stop having sex and be a real 13 year old. Its just so sad that there are so many of you girls out there and then we have all those couples that have been trying so hard so get pregnant but cant. Im not trying to beat down on you or anything but you have to learn to be careful. If you think your old enough for sex you have to be old enough for the responsibilities that come along with it. Look just tell your parents and they will have the answers. They might not be the answers that you want or like, but your the kid and they are the parents, and they know whats best. Again I am not trying to be mean, or anything, it just sucks that these kind of posts are on here all the time, and its sad.|`|QhZUWx67aa	hah,<br>  you're screwed buttercup.<br>  <br>  you gotta be gentle with the 'rents, and make sure you tell them what a big mistake it was and cry,<br>  <br>  tell carl if he wouldn't of put his penis in your vag, this wouldn't be an issue.<br>  <br>  sorry girl.... hah.|`|IWzYB44raa	Talk to your parents.  They will be more understanding than you think.  Waiting to talk to them will only make you worry more.|`|d6dzoHvvaa	you need to talk to your parents first, they will be there for you and you need to tell your boyfriend the truth. Haven't you thought about what would happen if you got pregnant, you are only 13! You are too young to be having a baby!|`|xypA3yZMaa	Mammy and Pappy are going to spank you.
AA11961672	that is normal, unfortunately formula is not as easily digested as breastmilk is. Also rice cereal is known to cause gas and constipation.<br>  <br>  You can slowly begin to introduce fruits and veggies as long as you are given the ok by your Dr.<br>  You introduce one food at a time, wait 3 to 4 days to make sure there is no allergies to the new food then you can try another one. After trying a few things then you can mix them...such as cereal and bananas, or apples and bananas, etc...<br>  <br>  as you introduce more solid foods you can expect your daughter's waste to become more solid and adult like in texture and unfortunately in smell as well...makes you wish for those sweeter smelling breastmilk dirty diapers again! LOL|`|ae5106e0ddfd7ecb434859ce61fcdd18aa	That kind of poop is coming from the rice cereal. They can become constipated while eating it, especially if they are formula fed. Breastmilk makes their poo softer and easier to pass. Go ahead and start some veggies, it may help her. Wait on the fruits for a couple weeks so she won't get a sweet tooth, but the fruits will help too. I've heard that oatmeal cereal doesn't make them as constipated, but you're supposed to give rice cereal for awhile first, so you're doing the right thing!|`|MMj7YcXkaa	it means it is harder to pass!  its just because she is not BF anymore.  formula has more iron in it and makes stool thicker, sometimes constipating.  plus the rice cereal makes it thicker too.  you should try apple or pear juice or actually feeding her apple or pear babyfood.  she is old enough.  most start at 4 months.|`|EhGR05Etaa	At six months books and most doctors say babies can have green beans, peas, carrots, squash, sweet potatoes, applesauce, peaches, bananas.  Mostly all the jars that are listed with 1st foods.|`|SDjrojZXaa	it is probably the rice cereal binding her up a little so now that she has been on it for a month i would switch to oatmeal try that for a week to make sure there are no reactions and then you can try adding some apples or banana baby food in with it|`|x7vTKP24aa	my daughter is jocelyn elise just turned 5 months. my dr said wait till 6 months to start the cereal and other foods, idk about the poo problems, i would call the dr about em.
AA11961672	in early pregnancy spotting after sex can be normal.<br>  Light cramps can also be normal, your uterus is expanding, pulling and putting pressure on your ligaments.<br>  BUT<br>  spotting and cramps can also be a sign that something is wrong, if the spotting gets worse I would call your Dr ASAP I would also halt all sexual activity until the spotting is gone.|`|AA11724307	my doctor told me cramps are very normal as the body is adjusting and making room for the baby.  He also said that I may spot after sex and if so then to avoid having sex for about 2 weeks after the bleeding stops.|`|rzf4tMXGaa	light period like cramps were a sign of pregnancy for me.  but I never spotted.  I don't think at 2 and a half weeks the pregnancy test could say posiive. you are probably father along.  you have to be at least 4 or five weeks. You should go to a clinic to make sure everything is fine and to calculate your due date.  <br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|H0sJU68Oaa	Some women do this when the egg is implanting. I did. Its always best to speak to your midwife asap to make sure. I wouldn't worry though it dosent help just make sure you speak to your midwife.|`|6PEOqeLOaa	spotting after intercourse is normal. However let you doctor know she will check you out just to make sure everything is okay.
AA10700407	ask your ob/gyn first.  generally, it's recommended that a pregnant woman not start anything new, like working out.  since you haven't done it in a while, that goes for you.  especially since you have already had problems.|`|wURg3jBcaa	Definitely talk to your doctor, and TAKE IT EASY.  You may have been a gym bunny before, but since you haven't been for a while, you need to be extra careful.  I do think that exercise during pregnancy is awesome for you and your baby if it's done the right way.   Also wear a heart rate monitor, and don't go above 60-70% max.|`|egN478Bbaa	U should always consult ur doctor.  Esp since u had the miscarraige.

Before i was pregnant I was NOT a morning person.<br>  *At 2 weeks, before I knew, I was driving house hunting with my husband and almost puked in the car. I thought it was his driving ... guess it wasnt!!!<br>  *At 2 weeks I was shopping at Meijer and felt like I was going to pass out after I hit the second aisle.<br>  <br>  I really hope you get a positive test soon!!! Good luck!|`|WtTUNC8Naa	Pregnancy symptoms differ from woman to woman and pregnancy to pregnancy; however, one of the most significant pregnancy symptoms is a delayed or missed menstrual cycle. Understanding the signs and symptoms of pregnancy is important because each symptom may be related to something other than pregnancy. Some women experience signs or symptoms of pregnancy within a week of conception. For other women, pregnancy symptoms may develop over a few weeks or may not be present at all. Below is a listing of some of the most common pregnancy signs symptoms. If you have been sexually active and experiencing any of the following symptoms it is important to take a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  Implantation Bleeding:<br>  Implantation bleeding can be one of the earliest pregnancy symptoms. About 6-12 days after conception, the embryo implants itself into the uterine wall. Some women will experience spotting as well as some cramping. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Actual menstruation, altered menstruation, changes in birth control pill, infection, or abrasion from intercourse.<br>  <br>  Delay/Difference in Menstruation:<br>  A delayed or missed menstruation is the most common pregnancy symptom leading a woman to test for pregnancy. When you become pregnant, your next period should be missed. Many women can bleed while they are pregnant, but typically the bleeding will be shorter or lighter than a normal period.<br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Excessive weight gain/loss, fatigue, hormonal problems, tension, stress, ceasing to take the birth control pill, or breast-feeding.<br>  <br>  Swollen/Tender Breasts:<br>  Swollen or tender breasts is a pregnancy symptom which may begin as early as 1-2 weeks after conception. Women may notice changes in their breasts; they may be tender to the touch, sore, or swollen. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance, birth control pills, impending menstruation (PMS) can also cause your breasts to be swollen or tender.<br>  <br>  Fatigue/Tiredness:<br>  Feeling fatigued or more tired is a pregnancy symptom which can also start as early as the first week after conception. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Stress, exhaustion, depression, common cold or flu, or other illnesses can also leave you feeling tired or fatigued.<br>  <br>  Nausea/Morning Sickness:<br>  This well-known pregnancy symptom will often show up between 2-8 weeks after conception. Some women are fortunate to not deal with morning sickness at all, while others will feel nauseous throughout most of their pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Food poisoning, stress, or other stomach disorders can also cause you to feel queasy.<br>  <br>  Backaches:<br>  Lower backaches may be a symptom that occurs early in pregnancy; however, it is common to experience a dull backache throughout an entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Impending menstruation, stress, other back problems, and physical or mental strains.<br>  <br>  Headaches:<br>  The sudden rise of hormones in your body can cause you to have headaches early in pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Dehydration, caffeine withdrawal, impending menstruation, eye strain, or other ailments can be the source of frequent or chronic headaches.<br>  <br>  Frequent Urination:<br>  Around 6-8 weeks after conception, you may find yourself making a few extra trips to the bathroom. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Urinary tract infection, diabetes, increasing liquid intake, or taking excessive diuretics.<br>  <br>  Darkening of Areolas:<br>  If you are pregnant, the skin around your nipples may get darker. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance unrelated to pregnancy or may be a leftover effect from a previous pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Food Cravings:<br>  While you may not have a strong desire to eat pickles and ice cream, many women will feel cravings for certain foods when they are pregnant. This can last throughout your entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Poor diet, lack of a certain nutrient, stress, depression, or impending menstruation.<br>  <br>  Best bet is to take a pregnancy test once you miss your period<br>  <a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/gettingpregnant/earlypregnancysymptoms.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanpregnancy.org/getting...</a>|`|kHmDUPsraa	For me it's been mild cramping on and off, sore breasts (kind of comes and goes, but overall are very sore), areola's a little darker, occasional dizziness, frequent BMs, stronger sense of smell.  I've had no bleeding.  I'm just about at 6 weeks and haven't really had morning sickness.  Honestly, I wouldn't necessary think I was pregnant (other than the missed period) if it hadn't been confirmed for me!|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	Me personaly had NOTHING i have had the easiest pain free pregnancies i have ever seen maybe a couple time like 4 i felt like i had to throw up but i never did & resently i am feelin braxton hicks at 25 weeks.. but i never felt bloated or anything no sore breast nothing|`|tGgLhOIGaa	Hey,<br>  many women find they feel nothing until a lot later on in the pregnancy whereas some women can find that they know they are pregnant from the moment they conceived!!<br>  early symptoms such as<br>  bloating<br>  nausea<br>  sore/ tender breasts<br>  headaches<br>  dizzyness<br>  fluttering in the lower stomach<br>  spotting (implantation bleeding)<br>  missed period<br>  <br>  Baby dust to you|`|6fbbef3a86754c97a2ee57742fbd01acaa	Tender boobies<br>  Frequent Urination<br>  Spotting<br>  cramps<br>  Nausea--u may throw up..(i did)<br>  Increased smell<br>  Increased Saliva ..yuck i know|`|iOBLk9k2aa	sore breast, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and even if you are tired and feel like sleeping all the time, fatigue. also some women feel their stomach different.
AA12362903	I am against abortion unless the baby's or mother's lives are in danger.  I wouldn't have anything against a woman who wanted to have one in the instance of rape or incest either.  What I really oppose is a woman that considers abortion a form of birth control.  It disgusts me that women have these without giving a second thought.<br>  <br>  I tried for seven years to conceive and would never end a pregnancy willingly unless it was for reasons listed above.|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	I am a Christian and believe that it is wrong to have an abortion, a child is a child - regardless if it is still inutero.   But as a mother-to-be, we came across a situation that almost made me change my mind.  Our baby tested positive for DS and then I tested positive for CF and we had to go to different specialists and heart doctors (when he was only a 20 week fetus) And it truly broke my heart to think that my child would be born only to suffer and die within the first moments of his life.  I couldn't imagine putting him through it, even though I know abortion was wrong and a sin.   But at my lowest point, I put it in God's hands and so far - so good - no signs of DS have been found and the CF is only a trace chance.<br>  <br>  While I still belive that abortion is wrong when the child is healthy, my opinions have changed when it's known that the child will suffer endlessly due to health complications.   I know - can't have it both ways - but I can understand better now, than I ever could before.|`|10r0CU38aa	I am 100% pro-life… I don’t care in any circumstance you should kill your child, and abortion is doing just that… People know what causes pregnancy, therefore, they need to take the precautions on avoiding getting pregnant. I don’t think there is any excuse at all under any circumstance/predicament/reason for why you have to have an abortion, bc its not a need it’s a want.|`|JFbWyKKDaa	This is a touchy subject, but here goes.<br>  <br>  I'm Pro-abortion- pro life in some ways, but it should be the mothers' choice.<br>  <br>  I think abortion is a personal choice and the government should stay out of peoples business. I'm pro-abortion, but it's not birth control. Abortions are life changing things and they're scary, but they aren't meant for things people say they are... it is killing, but if the mother can't afford to pay for her child or if having a child would kill the mother the baby is probably in a better place.  There's always adoption, but sometimes people don't agree with that either. Some adopted kids are molested and abused... that's my side fo the argument.  And I speak from personal experience.  I feel bad about it, but I might be dead if I had a baby at 14. I was WAY too small... insecure as well. That's probably why I had sex so young to begin with.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	I feel everyone has the right to decide for themselves what to do. I might not agree or respect your decisions but you can't force people to do something they don't want to (and when you try to the out come is always bad). I am pro-life for myself but pro-choice as a whole.|`|8mchLCQhaa	I am pro-life. Every baby deserves the chance at life.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	I am pro-choice. I believe that any woman should have the right to do what she feels is best for her body. If a woman is pregnant because of a rape, if having a baby is going to be detrimental to her in any way, or if she feels that she is not ready for a child, I believe that she should have the right to choose to have an abortion. If the government outlaws abortion, these females are going to choose to terminate their pregnancies in an unhealthy manner. They should be able to go to a safe location and have a medical procedure done instead of having to find some person in a non-regulated environment to perform what can be a very dangerous and damaging procedure. I do, however, feel that abortion should not be used as birth control. I was friends with a girl when I was younger who got pregnant 3 times and had 3 abortions in one year. I refused to speak to her afterward, because she would not go on the pill because it gave her pimples. She was also 24 years old, and should have been taking responsibility for her actions.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	This is my opinion.<br>  <br>  I believe in better sex education at home.  Teaching your kids about sex, birth control and the responsibility of having a child.<br>  <br>  Then I believe that one has the choice to abort a child rather than raising someone when the parent isn't ready or able to support themself and a child.  <br>  <br>  I also think there should be restrictions on how many abortions are allowed - after 1 you're pretty much a serial aborter.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	I am pro-choice. I think there are too many irresponsible people bringing children into the world they can't care for.<br>  <br>   I think too many children are seriously ill or handicapped due to drugs or situations they were exposed to during an unwanted pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I think too many children are having children, and teens lives are being forever scarred for bad choices they have made.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's the ultimate solution, there has to be better education and more access to birth control and more parents who care what their children are doing out there.|`|b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	You aren't going to get a good cross-section of society in this section. 90% of the people here are pregnant- your results are going to be very skewed! (Just to warn you.) Maybe try asking this in the Ethics section as well?<br>  <br>  But since you asked, <br>  <br>  My sister had an ectopic pregnancy. She would have died- she WAS dying- had she not terminated the pregnancy. As it is she was in the hospital for over a month after. <br>  <br>  My sister had a right to live. Her death would not have helped out the baby. I support her right to do that. So I would never say, ALL abortion is wrong. And I don't think her doctor is going to hell or should be charged with murder. <br>  <br>  Blanket statements make me uneasy...there are a lot of extreme circumstances out there.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	i'm for the right to choose abortions. consent to sex is not consent to motherhood. also, nothing and no one has the right to use another's body without their consent or against their wishes. this includes a fetus.|`|nXxtBkguaa	I'm not for anything that results in the ending of a human life.<br>  <br>  That would include abortion.
Ka52nbhNaa	Call BC/BS and ask them . . . they should be able to tell you right over the telephone.  I have BC/BS HMO in Massachusetts and it was a $250 co-pay . . . I remember asking the insurance rep if she was sure as I was having twins . . . and she told me, "yes, 2 for 1 special".  LOL!|`|qayCggxMaa	It all depends on your insurance plan.  I think for each of my deliveries I ended up paying less than $500 in copays, etc.  Deliveries were pretty well fully covered by my insurance.|`|w0eRRsoVaa	You can call BC/BS to find out.  You also should have received a booklet that had some of that information when you signed up for it and every year since if you receive your insurance through work.|`|buoqtZeFaa	I would say check your plan I also have Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan (PPO) and from what I understand all things are covered.  I know with the same insurance in the past I have had a major medical procedure (emergency surgery) and the entire 30,000 was covered by my insurance.|`|4TNavgDuaa	I had to have an unexpected c-section and that was covered 100% I had pay all together 500.00 for things like Epidural, for my daughter to be checked out from her doctor other odds they throw in. I guess it really depends on your insurance.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	After the birth (c-section) we got our bills in and they totaled up to less than four thousand.  We paid the smaller ones off in full and grouped the big ones together for monthly payments of $100 dollars and have less than $900 left to pay and my son is 16 months old.|`|DxbaEPbUaa	most likely, you'll only be responsible for the co-pay! check with your insurance carrier for the details.|`|3aqm1SDbaa	Look at your insurance plan with BCBS. You need to look at the deductible because that has to be met. Then you look at the percentage you have to pay for the maternity services, then look at the estimated cost of a delivery at the hospital you are planning on using, take the percentage of what insurance would cover and deduct it from the total cost and you have what you are going to end up paying. Also if you are having a boy you are most likely going to have to pay for the Circumsicion which in North Carolina is about $600 at the hospital and only $200 at the doc office. You could also call your insurance provider and see what their estimates are. GOOD LUCk|`|kgE96Nhcaa	I am in a different state and have United healthcare but I was able to call my insurance and get a written estimate of how much it would cost, that excludes of course if ICU or C-section is needed but they at least gave me the basic cost and what it pays for.  Mine is $25 copay for baby and $100 co-pay for me for the hospital and $25 copay to the OBGYN.  Total $150.00<br>  My first child I had MAMSI and paid over $3000 for the delivery ten years ago.  My sister has BCBS of NC and paid just at $1000 for her delivery this past year.
LKIhUMCgaa	well i'm not getting my crib until the baby shower, my friend offered me to bring it over now, but i said i'll just wait, but then i'll be 1 month away from my due date, so i'll probably put it together then, we'll have to sterilize all the sheets later anyway before she comes home, but putting the bed together if u already have it would probably be a good idea bc it'll be just 1 thing out of ur way, u'll have other things to set up later too, besides u could show off ur crib to everyone at the baby shower if u put it together now.|`|QSodlfMraa	my cousin put together her at 37 weeks, you can put it together now and have it in another room til the time comes, congrats:).|`|OG4410bdaa	I was alittle over enthuastic<br>  I had the entire nursery put together by the time I was 7 months, including the crib<br>  <br>  however I had a separate bedroom to devote to the baby's things...<br>  if I had to share a room with the baby then I probably would have waited to put the crib together<br>  its a large piece of furniture, do you really want to be moving around it for the next three months? with that big pregnant belly?<br>  <br>  sounds like the bedroom might get alittle crowded if you put it together now...I'd wait another month before putting the crib together, but make sure its up by 36 weeks, in case you go into labor early|`|DutTBV3caa	well i haven't gotten mind yet but i'll probably put it together as soon as i get it lol. you dont want to wait too long to put it together because the more pregnant you are the hard it may be. unless you have a man you can make do it. (i dunno if you're married or anything)<br>  <br>  congrats on baby!|`|MtC3CWZraa	My crib got put together about 2.5 months ago, but we didn't set up the pack 'n play (what baby will sleep in, in our room) until a couple of weeks ago.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	I'm 30 weeks and me and my husband put the crib together sometime last week. I couldn't wait.|`|IA5zVfk0aa	well my oldest sister waited until 8 months and she got so frustrated putting it together and go tired that i had to do it lol<br>  <br>  my second oldes sister did it at 6 months and had everything ready.. you can do it now! i would before i get too big that it makes it harder.. congratulations :)|`|4GwTDea1aa	I dont think you will ever get tired looking at it lol maybe anxious tho.. Im 35w and 3d mine is coming in tomorrow and as soon as i get home imma put that baby together.. i think either way if you want to put it together or not.. the nesting will kick in and you will give in :o) <br>  Good Luck lots of pieces!|`|RjdrO7DVaa	If you're going to use the crib right when you bring the baby home from the hospital rather than a cradle or bassinet, then put it up in the next few weeks.  You might go early so you'll want to be prepared.|`|F9pAWBG9aa	i put mine together this past weekend =) and im so proud to look at it!!! (i'm 35.3 wks prego) and well when i say i you must know i mean i watched my man do it ha|`|yPNvecc7aa	I did mine somewhere between 20-25 weeks. I did the whole nursery around then too.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Wow I guess I'm early. lol I just thought the sooner I do it, the sooner I'll see what stuff I am stilll missing.|`|VT24zOomaa	i'm 38 weeks 5 days, and i put mine up last weekend. but i'd say around 36 weeks is the latest. just in case the little one comes early.|`|DxbaEPbUaa	it's best if you do it while you can still get around. LOL!|`|2z3lTB2Raa	i started putting things together when i was 8months along
cJRFbZUaaa	Lots of women lose weight during pregnancy, especially right at the beginning like you are.  I think it's a combination of stress and morning sickness.  If the baby is still growing OK, there's no problem (you'll find out on your ultrasounds).  My breasts didn't get much bigger during pregnancy either, but the lactation consultant says they're still OK for breastfeeding.  Size doesn't matter that much.  Your enlarging tummy is a good sign because that's where the baby is!|`|ffAmoqFTaa	I lost about eight pounds and my belly got bigger too, my doctor said it's because my cervix was being pushed up which made my belly poke out a little bit more.  I have small boobs too and I still fit in my bra at 26 weeks, unlike my tummy they won't grow!!  Good luck and congrats.|`|CJqK40uFaa	im not ur size but i started out 234 and now i weigh 241 at 31 weeks and although i have really only gained 7 pounds in 7 months, obviously i keep losing and gaining and honey my stomach is HUGE. its normal. the baby is gaining all the weight he/she needs and if doc isnt worried then you shouldnt be either. and the weight u see is prolly water weight, but u will be showing soon enough. congrats!|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Your weight will actually re-distribute itself around your body when you are pregnant. It seems weird, I know. You could be retaining water or a bloating.|`|JITTMjasaa	First off let me say congrads. Your a moma now. I'm small and petite so I can't relate much. I can tell you that for the first 5 months of pregnancy I looked like I had a beer belly. I wasn't fat anywhere else but my belly. Then things took there normal route. Just make sure you get the proper nutrition and exercise lightly. A short walk or swim a day is good for example. I know it sounds lame but if you don't exercise, labor will be much harder. Just remember that every pregnancy is different and try to pay attention to your body. It will tell you if something is wrong. Also, don't stress the small stuff, your only stressing your baby out. Good luck, God Bless
AA11210211	yes it is possible to cause a miscarriage.|`|Jf0s6pByaa	well yeah you could do things but why not just go to planned parenthood or someplace where if you get an abortion they can not tell your parents without permission.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	I'm sure it is possible.  People that do that are stupid and are risking their own life in the process, plus there is a risk that it won't work and the baby will be born with problems.  It is much safer to just go to a clinic and have it done.   If you don't want a baby, then don't have sex.  If you are going to have sex anyway, then use two or more forms of protection.  With so many options available out there for contraception, there should be no such thing as an unwanted pregnancy.  (This is just my opinion, of course.)|`|v3LnJycKaa	um it wouldnt be a miscarriage it would be an abortion, but no sit ups and not eating for a few days would not cause a miscarriage.|`|WXExyAlWaa	She could use abortificants - there are certain herbs, etc, that were used for this purpose before surgical abortions were common. However if the wrong dosage is used it can be quite dangerous.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Not without some effort. Most miscarriages are due to chromosomal abnormalities. They are involuntary.|`|afAbSq5gaa	I suppose it is possible though i would NEVER recommend this as it could be very dangerous to the girl. Even when someone has a miscarriage naturally they still have to go to the doctors because they have to make sure all of it comes out of her otherwise it could make her really sick. So instead of trying to create a miscarriage i would suggest she just get an abortion, as long as she can get a ride to a clinic her parents never have to know.|`|BbwI6CJqaa	if you are pregnant and did not want it do it the right way.  You can harm yourself by doing some of those things.  You can also have the opposite happen and the baby can survive.  So my advice is if you do those things then your are mad. I would do it the right way and have it aborted.|`|VXSjZQc3aa	ummm im pretty sure this wasnt in a tv show .... you can but i hope no one tells you how. theres no way your going to be able to hide for long like i used to tell my friend "hun your gonna get fat and bulge"|`|p3d3E75oaa	no you can not force a miscarriage just have an abortion its safer that putting your body through all that crazy stuff|`|9vccbqrVaa	Go to the health food store and buy plenty of Pennyroyal tea and Blue cohosh root.  Have 1 cup every 4 hours for 5 days.  Don't go over that amount, though, as you could die.|`|d740a1806ac12ea6cc4e2e9a03202502aa	Yes she cohuld by doing sick things like drugs|`|bTXsr5JWaa	it is possible, but not a very nice idea...|`|arZTXrS8aa	Sure you're not....|`|WgDYb5Nvaa	.....yes it is possible. There is a certain pill out on the market that can force a miscarriage but i dont think it's FDA approved.....|`|JqtPN2kjaa	I think anyone could do anything. Should they is another question. I would tell anyone in that situation to pray and ask God what his will for that baby might be. Let it be him who decides not her.<br>  <br>  I have a friend who when we were teenagers she became pregnant, it was the worst thing she thought could ever happen to her. It was the with the wrong guy, wrong time and no resources. She considered so many times in ending her pregnancy. Years later she told me that child saved her life, on many occasions. Now that life has changed after 13 years, that child is her most sacred blessing. <br>  <br>  God always wants for us better than we want for ourselves. Accept his gift of Grace.

WXExyAlWaa	It depends how pregnant you are - spotting can be implantation bleeding, but it can also be a sign of trouble. I would go to the doctor and see what's up because it's better to be overcautious than undercautious. It's possible that the negative was a false negative.|`|XhIYAH6Laa	You need to go to the doctor so they can test and see. Spotting is sometimes normal and sometimes not. You probably need to have blood drawn and have an ultrasound to confirm you are still pregnant. Good Luck

1RwZZ2aPaa	PLEASE STOP THE CAPS LOCK.<br>  She's only 15 months. Don't except her to be a chatterbox. And instead of watching TV read her some stories.<br>  And how does a 15 month old baby learn a foreign language? If you want her to speak better English don't push foreign language on her.<br>  Again, she is only fifteen months old! She's not going to have a lot of interaction with other children.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Yes kids learning 2 languages develop languages more slowly than those learning just 1.  Not caring to interact much is a possible sign of something more than just a speech delay.  It is a possible autistic spectrum disorder.  There are all different levels but it is some impairment with social communication, social interaction, and imagination.  The obsessiveness with tv and videos is common for those on the spectrum.  I don't think it has anything to do with being tongue tied, she is making sounds.|`|Inc78M0Raa	CHILL!  DONT TYPE IN CAPS LOCK! She should be having books read to her. Not watching tv. You shouldn't expect too much out of her though. She's only a child. They learn at their own rate.|`|jr1VZz5yaa	It sounds normal.  <br>  <br>  There are many factors which influence a child's speech development.  These include having siblings, interaction with family, tv watching and the personality of the child.  It does not sound abnormal to me, however if you continue to become concerned you can make an appointment with your child's physician.  They could check her hearing, although further tests for autism and other disorders would generally not be run at this early age. <br>  <br>  I would follow the recommendation by others and try to maximize interaction with her.  Good ideas are having game times and reading times.|`|1enIWBGnaa	What has this got to do with "Adolesents'?<br>  Your neices speach problem is your sister's/brother's problem to deal with.  Sounds like she's not being forced into asking plainly/clearly for what she wants - she's being allowed to get what she wants by just making noices.|`|6vdSFw5Jaa	She shouldn't be watching as much tv and instead have someone read books to her and talk to her. That is where the best language development comes from.|`|T1htc1ZIaa	she doesn't like you??
nAGswgNCaa	it does increase the risk, but i think you're fine. you only really have to worry if you miss 3 pills in a row then you should use another backup form of protection. good luck|`|vue9NOhYaa	Your risk is slightly increased, yes.  Esp. since you missed two pills in two days.|`|zVdVGsoJaa	There might be a small chance, but not likely.  I did this all the time before my husband and I were married, but nothing ever came of it.  I wouldn't make a habit of it though.  It really messes with your hormones and your period!|`|AA11784984	There is always a chance of pregnancy if your on the pill or not. I got pregnant on the pill without missing any. Just keep them in your purse or something you always have with you so you don't forget. Set a time on your cell phone ( if you have one) to remind you to take it at the same time every day.|`|rELSr3Oaaa	Yes, your chances are greater of getting pregnant whenever you don't take them exactly as recommended. That's one of the ways people get pregnant while taking the pill. Most of the literature recommends taking them at the same time everyday and sites that they are less affective if you do not. Logic alone tells me that if taking them at a different time decreases their efficacy, missing a day here and there definitely would. <br>  I always kept my pills next to my toothbrush and took it at bedtime  This way when I reached for my toothbrush to brush my teeth I was reminded to take the pill.<br>  This is a quote from this link that pertains<br>  <a href="http://www.estronaut.com/a/pill_how_to_take.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.estronaut.com/a/pill_how_to_t...</a><br>   "What if I forget?<br>  It is extremely important that a woman take the pill everyday, but mistakes happen. If a woman misses one pill she should take the pill immediately when she remembers, and then take the next pill at the scheduled time. If she misses two pills in a row she should take two pills as soon as she remembers, and then take two pills the next day again. After this she should return to the regular schedule. In this case she should use a backup method of contraception for 7 days after the missed pills. If she misses three pills in a row she will probably begin her period. If this is the case or not, she should throw away the rest of her pack, and begin the next pack as if she had never been on the pill. For example, a Sunday starter would start the new pack the next Sunday. She should use backup contraception util she has been back on the pill for 7 days. "
n6XYYyoLaa	LOL, no, i use my points, why would i give them away? u willing to buy some? >:)|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Sure. <br>  TJ3PRTHTFTH7CV6<br>  Its off one of the huge club pack boxes of 150, I never use them so I don`t know what its worth.
oXzHvsBpaa	Contact the WIC office. They should be able to help you find proper housing and also help with any other government assistance programs. You could also contact the social security office nearest to you.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Have you tried looking for a job? There are still places that are hiring-Gas stations, telemarketing companies, state unemployment offices. Then you could pay for your own apartment, and maybe look into getting day care assistance from your state. If you stay at your job long enough, you could eventually make enough money so that you could get off welfare altogether.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	there is shelters for you and your baby! you can call 311 and tell them what you are in need of and they might be able to help you or if you have a friend you can stay with try taht the system isnt much help if you and your baby is in danger go to a shelter at first they can help call your local public aid worker! be careful good luck please let me know how it works out?! gntpaula@gmail.com|`|AA11784984	You have to go and apply for it. Depending on what job you have and how much you make you will probably get on it. You can also apply for food stamps and state insurance.|`|hY5mMi90aa	The best is to check with the abused women shelters in your area?  For what reason do u need to leave your home.

AA11660585	u can  passably be pregnant but have u heard of if in ur mind u keep thinking ur pregnant ur body will make u late on ur period? but to tell u the truth i don't think u will be pregnant because u got ur period 2 weeks after if u were pregnant u wouldn't get no period at all but i wish u the best of luck|`|uuHPneEcaa	i would take another test. just to be sure. u might have taken it too early, when u do it like that u should use morning urine. I took mine when I was 5 days late (in the after noon) and it was positive. and one when I was 7 days late (at a clinic) and it was positive.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	The test would have been positive for sure by this point, first morning urine is when you are just before your period or only a few days late. If you want to be sure, test again in 7 days, you may have your dates mixed up.|`|29a2wm7Eaa	Take another test.  If it comes out positive you know your answer.  If it comes out negative I'd wait for a bit and then go to the doctor.|`|5cd52d24c5f7667ec458aba89c056f19aa	if you still don't get your period in a few days, call your OBGYN and have them give you a blood test.  That will tell if you're pregnant or not.|`|AqU180claa	I would wait and take at least one pregnancy test in the morning.|`|86PuYgDJaa	I'd give it three more days then test again|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I'd wait a few more days and if you still haven't gotten your period, then take another pregnancy test.

Lay off the sex.|`|TC00nL07aa	Okay well if you think a girl can get pregnant by cumming in her mouth than you deffanity are way to young to be having sex.

Good luck to you.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	If it was 3 positive results you are pregnant. Your doctor will be able to determine how far along you are.  It is probably this cycle that got you pregnant, having a period while pregnant is unusual. Congratulations:)|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Were they positive or negative?<br>  <br>  Well, since they were positive, I think even the cheap tests are right. 3 positives are hard to ignore, no matter what. I'm gonna go ahead and say you're definitely pregnant.|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	was it + or - ???|`|mc6YtaRbaa	If all 3 were positive, then yes you are pregnant. If your period was due on 2/18 then I'm assuming you had your last period around 1/21 so you would be about 5 weeks pregnant. Your Dr. can confirm that for you tomorrow. 3 tests would not be wrong. It is extremely rare to get a false positive on a pregnancy test.|`|fULZei1haa	these test are more effective if you take them with the first "morning pee", so you should wait to take another test til tomorrow anyway.  BTW go for the more expensive test and you only need one.  Your best bet is to go to the dr anyway so just have patience til tomorrow!|`|WPI0Z47saa	If you got 3 positives then you are pregnant. False negatives are common but false positives are rare. Three false positives would probably be nearly impossible. Make an appointment with your OB/GYN to confirm with a blood test. They usually make your first appointment when you are about 8 weeks pregnant.|`|v0aKxF6iaa	i bought 3 tests from dollar tree they all came up positive and i was pregnant. and once i bought 2 and both came up negative and i went to the doc and he confirmed that i wasnt pregnant.|`|JITTMjasaa	Wait till the apt.

Just relax and know that there is nothing you can do so just take it as it comes.|`|5cd52d24c5f7667ec458aba89c056f19aa	if you're not sure how far along you are, your dr. will schedule you for an ultrasound and by measuring your fetus they can tell you how far along you are.|`|23bs0kAKaa	i doubt all three are wrong, by the sound of it they say that you are not preggerzz. You should try to use different brands too tho|`|ebM6CxRQaa	Were they positive? If they were positive you are pregnant... they will do an Ultrasound and be able to tell how far along you are and give you a due date. <br>  <br>  It is normal to be scared the first time you are pregnant (whether it was planned/unplanned... where you are single/married etc... there are just a lot of unexpected things in the future...) But you will do fine it is a wonderful and exciting time! GL|`|WtTUNC8Naa	Well were they positive or negative?<br>  I mean if you took three, and they were all positive, you are probably pregnant. Just see what the tests show up at the doctors. Good luck, don't be scared. It will all be ok<br>  <br>  Early Pregnancy Signs:<br>  Implantation Bleeding:<br>  Implantation bleeding can be one of the earliest pregnancy symptoms. About 6-12 days after conception, the embryo implants itself into the uterine wall. Some women will experience spotting as well as some cramping. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Actual menstruation, altered menstruation, changes in birth control pill, infection, or abrasion from intercourse.<br>  <br>  Delay/Difference in Menstruation:<br>  A delayed or missed menstruation is the most common pregnancy symptom leading a woman to test for pregnancy. When you become pregnant, your next period should be missed. Many women can bleed while they are pregnant, but typically the bleeding will be shorter or lighter than a normal period.<br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Excessive weight gain/loss, fatigue, hormonal problems, tension, stress, ceasing to take the birth control pill, or breast-feeding.<br>  <br>  Swollen/Tender Breasts:<br>  Swollen or tender breasts is a pregnancy symptom which may begin as early as 1-2 weeks after conception. Women may notice changes in their breasts; they may be tender to the touch, sore, or swollen. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance, birth control pills, impending menstruation (PMS) can also cause your breasts to be swollen or tender.<br>  <br>  Fatigue/Tiredness:<br>  Feeling fatigued or more tired is a pregnancy symptom which can also start as early as the first week after conception. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Stress, exhaustion, depression, common cold or flu, or other illnesses can also leave you feeling tired or fatigued.<br>  <br>  Nausea/Morning Sickness:<br>  This well-known pregnancy symptom will often show up between 2-8 weeks after conception. Some women are fortunate to not deal with morning sickness at all, while others will feel nauseous throughout most of their pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Food poisoning, stress, or other stomach disorders can also cause you to feel queasy.<br>  <br>  Backaches:<br>  Lower backaches may be a symptom that occurs early in pregnancy; however, it is common to experience a dull backache throughout an entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Impending menstruation, stress, other back problems, and physical or mental strains.<br>  <br>  Headaches:<br>  The sudden rise of hormones in your body can cause you to have headaches early in pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Dehydration, caffeine withdrawal, impending menstruation, eye strain, or other ailments can be the source of frequent or chronic headaches.<br>  <br>  Frequent Urination:<br>  Around 6-8 weeks after conception, you may find yourself making a few extra trips to the bathroom. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Urinary tract infection, diabetes, increasing liquid intake, or taking excessive diuretics.<br>  <br>  Darkening of Areolas:<br>  If you are pregnant, the skin around your nipples may get darker. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance unrelated to pregnancy or may be a leftover effect from a previous pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Food Cravings:<br>  While you may not have a strong desire to eat pickles and ice cream, many women will feel cravings for certain foods when they are pregnant. This can last throughout your entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Poor diet, lack of a certain nutrient, stress, depression, or impending menstruation.|`|0p7ZiIIxaa	It is very difficult to get three false positives on pregnancy tests. Though they were inexpensive tests, they still you are producing HCG which is produced in your body when you are pregnant. I am having my baby very soon, and when I was taking the tests I bought many different kinds ranging from the dollar store kind, to the 30 dollar yes or no kind. That's when I found out that your body only produces that hormone when you are pregnant, and any sign of it being positive means you are pregnant, even the faintest line. Good luck with everything!|`|AqU180claa	You don't need to panic. Just stay calm. It's really hard to read pregnancy tests. My pregnancy  tests were really faint and I wasn't sure if I as pregnant either.  <br>  If you aren't pregnant you shouldn't get mad at yourself. Your only human. People make mistakes.
3w7VztEWaa	hah sounds possiable. al you can do is wait and see!!good luck.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	the best thing to do is to buy a test and take it to see the earlier the better then you will know what is going on with your body better and if you are and have the baby in 9 months then the best advice I can give you is have at least 6-8 packs of the LARGE diapers on hand they go through them like they are water|`|WnLRgTKlaa	you should really go buy a pregnancy test !|`|TnCTXKHzaa	go buy a test ept is the best
88581cf566c30acddb7ffe0f4e82d631aa	Yes the sex should be determined by your next visit, unless for some reason the baby is in a position where she can't see, but something my doc told me is that if you see a small white dot where the genitals are, it is a girl.  Good Luck!|`|xypA3yZMaa	i am going in at 16 weeks and they said they will check to see if they can tell me what my baby is. I am sure they can tell you too ;-) and i eat every 3 hours but normal amounts...|`|qQsFTkWmaa	yea they told me at 17 weeks i was having a boy...<br>  <br>  but some dr offices wont do a ultrasound till 20+ weeks<br>  <br>  just depends on how you drs work<br>  <br>  i didn eat like crazy.. but i had a endless craving for cheese..|`|S6QpB8QZaa	I am 14 weeks pregnant and yes I eat like crazy.

Z1e3Cxjoaa	I would go to the labor and delivery floor of your hospital and get a sonogram done to make sure your baby isn't in distress.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Your baby is moving; that is a very good thing!  Try not to worry and stay calm until your appointment tomorrow.|`|0iUxfCMcaa	if you are in that much pain i would call the doctor and let them know what happened and see what they say.|`|WbaSpiYpaa	I'm also 28 weeks, and if that happened to me I'd be really worried to.  The good news is that she's moving.  Is it possible to go to the local hospital to get checked out?  They could give you an ultrasound at the very least to see how the baby is positioned.  I'm sure everything is fine, but it's best to get looked at.  Good Luck!|`|90zcKChJaa	The same thing happened to me when I was about 25 weeks. I saw my doctor that day because it was scary, and they sent me to the hospital because I was having contractions. Long story short, everything was alright and we went home. <br>  <br>  It is much better to be safe than sorry. Only your doctor is able to let you know what is going on. Best wishes to you.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Is there anyway that you can be seen sooner then tomorrow? I wouldn't wait until then. I'm sure everything is fine but you should still make sure. If I were you I would call them and see if they could see me today and if not I would go to the ER and get checked out there to be on the safe side. good luck!|`|d96SSlrIaa	Your ok Just soak in some warm bath water and have some warm green tea  if you not bleeding then your good.
758cDKEFaa	i was bleeding at 5 weeks (also 6, 8, 9, 11 + 14 weeks!) when i had my first i just needed to know.<br>  so i rang up the hospital and asked to be put through to the delivery suite or labour and delivery (epa dont book appointents apparently they have to be booked through hospital staff only) and i said id had some bleeding and my midwife said if i had anymore to ring delivery and get a scan booked and ive had some bleeding agen.<br>  i wasnt bleeding agen but they got me a scan booked straught away so i knew telling a little white lie would get me scan :)<br>  the next day i found out my baby was more than happy in there!|`|W8aiAWe2aa	Hi there,<br>  I live in Portsmouth.<br>  I would advise you to go to Minor Injuries at St Marys hospital, Portsmouth and they will take it from there for you. <br>  <br>  They are open all day until 9.30<br>  Go now!!!!!<br>  <br>  Am sure you will be okay. DO explain that your GP isn;t bothered.|`|claUGpVRaa	Contact your community midwife straight away and explain your doctor hasn't been helpful when you have concerns. The midwifes are great, because they specialise in pregnant women!|`|98WKYtfwaa	Call up the NHS 24 and explain that you're experiencing bleeding and how far along you are, tell them you're worried and your doctor isn't doing anything to help you.<br>  <br>  They will tell you what they think and then refer you to the right department in the hospital.|`|inA6ZLeAaa	If you are bleeding you are more than likely having a miscarriage, I did the same at 7.5 weeks. You still need to go to the dr. and find out.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Go to the Emergency room. They'll check you!|`|VWyW8tJXaa	Ask your doctor to schedule you an ultrasound at the hospital. They will be able to tell you if everything looks normal. They may even be able to detect a heartbeat. 6 weeks may be a bit too early for the heart beat, though. The hospital machines are way better than any doctors office. That is where he would send you if he thought you miscarried. I think most doctors have to write an order form for you to go, but you could also just call the hospital and check if you can schedule your own appointment. I went at 8 weeks and got a clear picture of my baby! :)|`|Di7KqbVQaa	I dont think you can just 'walk in' however you have two options.<br>  <br>  You can call the EPU and explain the extent of your bleeding. If you're not in major pain, they may not see you today and may book you an appointment within the next day or two. They are normally very very busy.<br>  <br>  However I did once call NHS24 who told me to go to A & E should I wish. So i did. They took me to the EPU and they scanned me. So it might be an option to just walk in to the A & E|`|44uorNhOaa	go to the hospital if your that worried about it.|`|QeALCWbqaa	call up
xRZ1PRZwaa	Hi! I'd recommend breastfeeding as much as you can; if that is two times a day, terrific! That will be very helpful for your little guy. The more you nurse, the more milk you will produce.<br>  <br>  Supplementing him with formula is probably a good idea for when you go back to work because working, spending time with your baby and pumping is probably going to be too much. You're better off spending that pumping time actually nursing (or sleeping!).<br>  <br>  You may find that your milk supply diminishes with reduced feeding though (although, not necessarily), so be prepared for alternative feeding methods (nursing more or formula) in the event that this happens.<br>  <br>  Regarding baby starter cereals, the 'pros' say six months, but many moms start their little ones with success between 4 and 6 months when their babies are strong enough and ready (i.e. the baby can hold his/her head up on his/her own).<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|oXIYHsDaaa	I would recommend breast feeding as much as you can, you might dry up completely if you only nurse once a day, but once a day is better then nothing. You can start cereal when your baby can:<br>  1) sit up well with good head control<br>  2) has lost the tongue thrust reflex that pushes solids out of the mouth<br>  3) is still hungry after 8-10 feedings a day<br>  4) shows an interest in food ie: reaches for food and tries to put it in his mouth, screams incessantly when others eat near him.<br>  <br>  most babies are ready around 6 months but never before 4 months, and don't put cereal in the bottle, it makes it easy for baby to over eat and get an upset tummy and since it doesn't dissolve completely, the cereal particles can be aspirated into the lungs.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Generally your milk slows down when you supplement with formula. Was it doing this before you started supplementing? If you're going back to work, you can either pump (I would suggest using a really good hospital grade pump) or switch totally to formula, which he'll be fine with. As far as solids and cereal, most people recommend waiting until 6 months. <br>  <br>  You can try Fenugreek supplements and pumping more to boost your supply, if that's what you want to do. If you're able to, you can increase your supply and then store breastmilk for when you go back to work.|`|vue9NOhYaa	It seems that you do not quite understand the way milk production works.  The *reason* you have so little milk is that you aren't nursing often enough.  If baby is only nursing twice a day, your milk supply is going to drop and probably, in the next few weeks, dry up completely. (A mother of a nursing toddler can probably maintain a supply nursing 2-3 times a day, but at 2 months, such infrequent feeds WILL cause your milk to dry up.)<br>  <br>  If you want to nurse your baby, you need to be nursing your baby.  Offer the breast at least every 2 hours during the day, and a couple of times at night. The frequent stimluation will increase your supply. If you must continue to supplement (and you probably will, at least until your supply improves)  do so only after baby has nursed for 20-40 minutes and, if possible, avoid bottles. (You can use a nursing supplementer, or cup or spoon.  A lactation consultant can help here.)<br>  <br>  When you go back to work, pump during the workday and the caregiver can offer the milk.  If necessary, you can supplement with formula, but you will need to pump to keep your supply up. <br>  <br>  Solid foods (cereal or jarred foods) are usually started around 6 months.<br>  <br>  Definitely get in touch with a lactation consultant.  You will need her help to increase your supply and get baby nursing well again.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	Physically yes, if you are offering a substitute (formula) for those other feedings.  If you would like to nurse you can though, the use of the formula has lessened your milk production.  It is possible to get it back up again if that is what you would like to do.  Any bit of breast milk helps but it will not have anywhere near the effectiveness of exclusive nursing/breast milk for the first 6 months. <br>  <br>  See "Just one bottle won't hurt - or will it?" <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/bf/supplement.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/b...</a>|`|vXYQcixvaa	yes! i only did 2 breast milk feedings a day...the rest was formula and my baby girl is now 6 months and at her last check up doc says shes growing great. Dont start rice cereal until about 4 or 5 months. Their digestive systems have to be able to with stand solids!<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  ps: i only did 2 breastmilk feedings bc she wouldn't latch and i ended up losing my supply even tho i was pumping.<br>  :(|`|VvAOuXTCaa	Well they say that any is better then none. So as much as you can give a day is better then nothing. It's totally up to you. Plus you can pump at work,if you wanted to. Oh and the more you nurse the more you produce.
kkxn0Q4Aaa	you've had sex|`|jyzpX5iuaa	You mean before your missed period.<br>  <br>  Thats easy, <br>  Never using birth control<br>  then have sex<br>  Frequent urination<br>  upset stomach<br>  muscle pain<br>  headaches<br>  sore feet<br>  emotional mood swings<br>  uneasiness<br>  rash<br>  swollen appendages<br>  vivid dreams<br>  <br>  Do some research, or ask your mom|`|lnnwXsdsaa	Sometimes there are no signs at all. My first pregnancy, aside from a missed period, I had no signs AT ALL untill I was about 4-5 months pregnant and my belly started showing and the baby started kicking!

It's every pregnancy is different, and every woman is different.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It's different with everyone.

TXddP0uxaa	I was induced with my son.  In my case, my water broke (at 7am) and contractions never started.  At noon, it was decided to start inducing.  I was given pitocin, and chose to have an epidural at the same time.  It was actually just lovely.  I hung out all day, no pain, basically just being bored.  At about 12:30am, I knew it was time to push (that was the first time I had felt any pressure or discomfort all day).  He was born at 1:17 am.|`|63a5d617239afd4f62c7622fb8d95be3aa	When I was induced this is what happened,<br>  <br>  The night I was admitted they put a prostoglandin pessary into my cervix. The next morning I was contracting and started dilating. The next night I was put into the labour suit, where they broke my waters (I had to walk around and bounce on the birthing ball to get her in a better position though) Then because I was not dilating or contracting fast enough they put a syntometrine drip into my hand which brough the contractions back to back.<br>   I was monitored continuasly.<br>  <br>  I had gas & air, and morphine for pain reliefe. It does hurt but its worth it. <br>  It took just over 24 hours for my daughter, Laila, to arrive.<br>  <br>  Good luck, you will be fine. Congratulations in advance!<br>  xxx|`|4YIUxSlYaa	I was induced at 42 weeks.  The nurse will insert a tablet into your uterus and hopefully start labour.<br>  <br>  I was induced at 6pm - nothing happened.  Tried again at 10pm and finally went into labour around 11pm.  Established labour at 3am.  Baby was born at 8:29am :]|`|d6a1ec4f105a0e8a0ddec27db0cf8b47aa	I was induced when i had my son as you say each story will be different i had my waters broken which was fine for about 10 Min's then was very painful when contractions kicked in.I also had some cream put on my cervix to help dilate me i think.this was late morning when i went in and i had my son at 2 Min's to midnight.Every birth is different some ppl are more tolerant to pain than others and some are quick either way good luck and remember no matter how much it hurts you will forget how painful it was and when u hold your child for the first time is all worth it. I also had an epidural which in my opinion was a very good idea lol<br>   Good luck xx xx|`|4yGGjs7zaa	i was induced with my son because he was a big baby (9lb at birth), i went into hopsital around 8 am, they monitored me and did a heart trace of the baby for about 20 mins, check my urine, blood pressure etc and where the baby was lying. they then gave me a gel pessery which is used to soften your cervix and was told to lay for 20 mins so it could atke affect i had this done only once as it worked well for me first time, i did plenty of walking around the hospital, i had my waters broken around 5 and i gave birth to my healthy son and 9.55pm,<br>  <br>  some people take longer in labour! and there are other ways of induction, you may be given a pill or a drip it all depends on where you live and hospitals etc!<br>  <br>  i did find that labour was a bit more painful when i was induiced as to when i went into labour with my daughter naturally! i think it depends on your pain threshhold really! some people suffer more than others!<br>  <br>  i only used gas and air both times and i had my daughter (2nd baby) at home!<br>  Good Luck for you!|`|ugbe40X3aa	it all depends on your body they give you a pesery one in the morning and then could be one in the evening the first one the chance is nothing will seem to be happening you will be monitored for a while not all the time so you cna move about then the second is given in the evening and after that one things can start to happen but some times a third ne can be needed once the midwife can break your water then things are going well but if the pesery don't work and the midwife can't break your water then you may have to have a c section|`|ooadGX6Laa	Hi, <br>  <br>  I had to be induced at 38 weeks and 5 days pregnant due to developing pre eclampsia.  I was taken down to the delivery suite at 6pm, they did an internal examination and then put this gel stuff inside me to 'induce' me.  My contractions started about 2 hours later, started off as mild cramping just like period pains, so I was given painkillers to start with.  Once I was 4 cm dilated (at 12am) they did another examination and broke my waters. By then, my contractions had got worse and was given stronger pain relief. By 6cm dilated I was given the epidural, which took away all the pain.  Everyone is different, you may progress through the dilation stage really quickly, or it could taken hours, so be prepared.  I had a really bad labour in the end, but that was due to me and not something everyone goes through.  All I can advise is, get PLENTY of sleep these next few days before they induce you, it could be a long labour, and then once your baby arrives, its sleepless or short of sleep nights.  Good Luck though and I really hope this info helps.XX
ebQJsYTxaa	My children have not been vaccinated at all.<br>  <br>  I breastfed one child for 18 months and the other for 2 years. We eat reasonably healthy foods.  I don't make a big effort about hygiene or keeping the house clean.  We live normal lives in a big city, and I make no effort to keep them away from other kids or people.<br>  <br>  I give them sodium ascorbate when they are sick. It is a powdered, buffered form of vitamin C. <a href="http://www.iherb.com/productdetails.aspx?pid=-7152293197697039798&utm_source=g&utm_medium=x" rel="nofollow">http://www.iherb.com/productdetails.aspx...</a> It is especially helpful for pertussis (whooping cough), which my daughter and I both had when she was 2 1/2 years old.<br>  <br>  I do not lower fevers.  Fevers are important for fighting illness, and the body knows how high the fever needs to be for the particular illness.  Brain damage from fever will not happen unless the fever reaches 107.6 <a href="http://www.adventisthealthcare.com/AHC/health/library/Health_Illustrated_Encyclopedia/1/1_003090.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.adventisthealthcare.com/AHC/h...</a>  Also, Tylenol has been linked to all sorts of childhood problems, including asthma. <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26788879/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26788879/</a>|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Common sense I guess. Breast feed to give their immune system a boost. Don't take them out long in the cold. Don't expose them to people with illnesses. Don't expose them to many young or school aged children. That's just as a baby. As an older child I would say just modify it like you always do to keep your child from getting sick. My son is the healthiest baby I know and he has no immunizations and won't be getting any.|`|G2auAv1Saa	Most diseases children are vaccinated against aren't around anymore and when they are, the cases are isolated.<br>  There are no vaccines for the common illness' of children.|`|kPNnfjNSaa	Vaccinations don't protect against everything. And there's the old-school "wash your hands" policy. <br>  <br>  Also, children who are not constantly medicated have a tendancy to get sick less as they grow up because they fight off sicknesses and have more antibodies. A stronger immune system is preferable than a weaker one that gets sick more often.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	My son has all of his vaccinations, but if we were to go it again I would only give him selective vaccinations.<br>  <br>  How would I keep him from getting sick?  Getting sick from what? Colds and flus or polio, measles, chicken pox, or hepatitis? The biggest things I'd do is ensure proper hygiene and health.  Hands are washed before and after eating, after using the bathroom, before and after helping prepare food, baths/showers are taken at least every other day etc.  Our home would be cleaner than it is now.  This wouldn't be to prevent him from becoming ill from germs and generic stuff, but to lower the amount of illness that could *potentially* be transmitted.  <br>  <br>  We'd also make sure that we were preparing foods properly to prevent Hepatitis A, and we'd make sure he didn't share toys (during the chewing stages) or food with anyone who has Hepatitis B.<br>  <br>  I'd also make sure that he ate a strong and healthy diet, which would help his immune system fight off any thing trying to attack it better than it would if he were eating a not-so-great diet.<br>  <br>  It's not about, for me anyway, making sure that he never catches anything.  It's about making sure that his body is strong enough and I am on top of things enough to keep his illnesses mild and to help him recover fully and build a strong immunity.  This is what applies for measles, mumps, and the chicken pox, at least.  I can help control his fever, push fluids, and get him antibiotics for any bacterial infections that happen to form.<br>  <br>  Rotavirus is a fecal-oral transmission, so as long as I make sure he doesn't eat his poop, or anyone else's poop, we'll be okay with that.<br>  <br>  The flu vaccine is pretty ineffective for children under 5, and not super effective anyway, so I'll take my chances with the flu and treating its symptoms.<br>  <br>  I would get the DtaP vaccines, because I wouldn't want to take such a great risk with a newborn having whooping cough, diphtheria, or tetanus.  <br>  <br>  I'm torn on the polio vaccine, and not sure if I would give that or not.  I've seen polio be crippling, but I've seen it be no big deal at all, and better health and hygiene prevent the spreading of the disease regardless.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Julienne's mom, it's not just herd immunity that keeps disease rates low.  We have made wonderful strides in personal hygiene and health since before vaccinations were introduced.  We know more about how diseases are transmitted, and we know more about how to keep our bodies strong and healthy.  Even highly transmittable diseases aren't as big of a deal now because we have this better hygiene and health.  If we were to not be vaccinated, we would still be much less likely to catch and pass along diseases because of our sanitation, hygiene, and health.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Vaccinated and unvaccinated children BOTH get sick.  it's a part of life.  No one can keep their children from ever getting sick.|`|GU3RauKOaa	Its called herd vaccination. As long as most of the "herd" is vaccinated, those serious diseases will rarely show up, therefore the unvaccinated kids are not at as much risk, unless they travel outside of the country.<br>  <br>  Vaccines are very important, but in the case of children who have autism in their family and are at high risk for autism it can be a good thing to not vaccinate and to rely on the herd vaccination. Not every baby is a good candidate for vaccines.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Ok Jack g, whatever you say: <a href="http://www.know-vaccines.org/autism.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.know-vaccines.org/autism.html</a>|`|f298053ebd42df4c5da5f85a6ead96d4aa	My daughter has received only some vaccines. You can't prevent your child from getting sick, but you can make sure their immune system is in tip-top shape so that when they do get sick, their body fights it off easily. For me this includes breastfeeding beyond a year, feeding high-quality, nutritious foods, and not having her in daycare or other settings where she's likely to be exposed to lots of other kids.<br>  <br>  However, I am not one of those parents who follows her around with Lysol, sanitizing everything she touches. I also believe that to have a strong immune system, you must expose yourself to germs so your body learns how to fight them off. My kid plays outside, eats dirt, and is in general *a kid*. I just don't worry about her getting sick because I know I've done everything I can to protect her.|`|bHfuVh6kaa	you can't - and as less and less vaccinate your child become more and more vulnerable - why would you not get your child vaccinated? - these diseases can cause disabilities and can kill. <br>  <br>  Someone on answers this week made a very valid point (sorry can't remember who it was) - people who don't vaccinate are still relying on the vaccines to keep their children safe by relying on the people who do vaccinate<br>  <br>  ETA - miss herrara - the reason that the diseases are not around any more is because of vaccination programmes - they will soon re -appear if vaccinated children drop below a certain level<br>  <br>  Vaccinations hve nothing to do with autism - it has been proven - my son was autistic before his jabs. They still don't know what does cause autism but you are born autistic and you die autisic - nothing that happens in between causes autism -  you do not develop it - this much they do know
xRZ1PRZwaa	Yes - he is too young to understand. He thinks your tone is amusing! Mommy makes him giggle!<br>  <br>  Teaching him to respond to 'no' is an ongoing one. Try to keep your tone consistent, and follow the 'no' up with changing his behaviour. For instance, if he's reaching for an outlet, say "No 'Josh'. Ouchie" and then move him. You'll do this about a trillion times or so before he starts to get it - when he's older, and after he is capable of seeing the relationship between cause and affect - I touch hot, it hurts. I bang head, it hurts. This level of development won't come for months and months.<br>  <br>  Some people in this forum might suggest 'slapping' the baby. In the case that they do, I will write proactively that that will only accomplish to teach that 'mommy hurts', not to respond to 'no'. So, unless the goal is to teach that 'mommy hurts' instead of 'mommy makes me giggle', a slap is really not a good idea.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps - try to not let him see you laugh when he laughs, as hard as that is!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Yes, he is.<br>  <br>  Presuming you are telling him no about something that matters (and if not, why are you doing it) then you simply reinforce by preventing him from continuing. Is he throwing food on the floor? Say no and take the plate away. Tearing up a book? Say no and put the book out of reach. Banging on a window? Say no and remove him from whatever he's standing on to get at the glass.<br>  <br>  Don't ever say no as part of a battle of wills, or to see if he'll comply. You need to teach him that when you say no, what he is doing stops instantly. Either he stops or you stop him. Defiance simply isn't an option.|`|bVaZ72f3aa	to be honest,there are many reasons.<br>  he may think ur not serious,then try the naughty step(treating him as a one year old,since he is close to it).<br>  that should work,as long as u get a stopwatch and it will help him understand..<br>  but moving him back to that place,so he understands will take a while...usually about 20mins..<br>  and after he has done it,u also succeeded ! reward him and yourself by an apology from him ONLY and a kiss..U DO NOT APOLOGISE.<br>  make sure he knows what he has done and apologize for that,tell him when u put him on the step or mat etc.<br>  good luck..<br>  xoxo<br>  hope that helped...it is a nanny 911 thing..but it works for my little brother who is a year old(and about 3 weeks :P )....he now listens to me,not just my parents...<br>  its respect towards him,and u get it back :)<br>  xoox
yDfq0YlXaa	I'm sure it's your boyfriend..one day is WAY to early to get pregnant, plus, if your temp went up on the 23rd..then you ovulated on the 22nd..which means you would have had to have gotten pregnant from intercourse between the 19th and the 24th.|`|0BC2WTyoaa	Yes, it is your boyfriends baby.  If you got a positive test the day after being with your ex it is not your ex's baby.  It takes 7-10 days for a test to show positive.  Relax  and congratulations  :)|`|nFj30sZcaa	You were definitely already pregnant BEFORE the one night stand. There's no way that you conceived and tested positive on a pregnancy test the next day, it would have been WAY too early.<br>  It's likely you feeling guilty about the situation. I wouldn't stress yourself out about it anymore.|`|ZXhX78wsaa	I would think that the baby belongs to your boyfriend : )<br>  Its seems early for it to have been your exes.<br>  But to be certain i suppose you could have a test takin.<br>  I do hope your boyfriend knows about the one night stand tho : /<br>  Yeah you know it was wrong and you wish you could take it back, but he still has the right to know.<br>  <br>  Good Luck Hon!|`|Q05rrSX4aa	There is no possible way that you could have sex and then have a + pregnancy test the very next day.  100% impossible.  So it is your boyfriends baby.  I wouldn't even worry about it at all.  Good Luck:)|`|zATQaiwIaa	at 30 years old you should know it would take longer than a day to get a positive HPT.|`|7RkINHF2aa	When your pregnant, you grow a baby in you're stomach.. It gets bigger, by now you would be showing.  Its very hard for me not to comment on how messed up that is.. i hope your boyfriend doesn't kill you.. maybe its not a baby and you have aids.|`|hAXJ47iAaa	I will respect your wishes to keep my personal opinions to myself...but I am very familiar with BBT charting, and from what you've stated, it sounds like you would have ovulated either the 20th or 21st, given the temp rise on the 22nd. Also, it takes at LEAST, the VERY least 6 days for the fertilzed embryo to implant into your uterus and therefore secrete HcG into your blood/urine to produce a positive pregnancy test. Also, you stated you had an ultrasound to confirm dates? This is fairly accurate.  I wouldn't worry. I think it's definitely the guilty conscious that is making you worry about this.  There is basically NO chance that this child could be from your ex husband. You CANNOT have sex the day before and have a positive pregnancy test the next day.  CANNOT!  You basically were pregnant for about a week or two...and your doctor counts your pregnancy start date from the LMP.<br>  Best of luck to you and your little blessing!

KDb96QS7aa	I had really bad acne as a teen and was one of the "test" subjects for accutane. They actually paid me to take it. It did the trick but afterward I still struggled quite a bit with acne and rosacea though not as bad.<br>  When I got pregnant, it got a little worse. Once I had my baby (I am breastfeeding for 9 months now) my skin has been perfect. I was just thinking yesterday if maybe the pregnancy or the breastfeeding had something to do with it or if I just finally reached "that age" when it will no longer be an issue (I am 28).  I'll be curious to see your other responses too!
AA11327039	I highly doubt a doctor would induce a woman at 3 1/2 weeks early just because the baby is getting too big.  There has to be a medical problem to induce that early.  My sister in law was recently induced because of size and they made sure to make her wait until she was only 10 days before her due date.  Her child ended up being a pound less than estimated.  The estimated weight was a little over 10 pounds.  The baby was actually barely 9 pounds.|`|DvWGTzLUaa	Big babies are common in women who have gestational diabeties. So if she had it and the doc thought the baby was gettin too big they'd induce. Pregnancy is 40 weeks and is calculated from the first day of the womans last menstrual period. The due dates are usually pretty close and are quite often confirmed by an ultrasound performed in early pregnancy.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	You are pregnant for 40 weeks, but generally women deliver between 37-42 weeks <br>  My son was almost 11 pounds and I was 41 weeks <br>  It is possible that they had the date wrong in the first place! Or she may have had gestational diabetes and not known it!|`|S6QpB8QZaa	My son actually weighed 10lbs 2 ozs. and I have had 3 friends give birth to babies that big. My stomach actually measured 40 weeks when I was 36 weeks.  Your due date goes by your first day of your last period and you are pregnant 40 weeks.|`|0iUxfCMcaa	they say 40wks in a pregnancy which is actually 10 months instead of nine. but if this is not her first child then yeah a baby can be big early. plus the due date can be off by 2wks either way.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	If she had gestational diabetes, maybe ... Maybe her dates were off. There could be genetic issues or something, who knows. I've heard of preterm babies weighing over 7 lbs so I guess anything is possible. <br>  <br>  A typical pregnancy is considered 40 weeks and you calculate it from the first day of your last period. So technically it's 10 lunar months, not nine.
2013075b963c70173a3dc732a3f43ecfaa	Sadly... we all have to wait to find out if we are pregnant. And I am sure we all wish we could find out as soon as the egg is fertilized. So frustrating!<br>  <br>  The pamphlet says you "can" ovulate right away. Honestly, the pill does not stop ovulation at all in any given cycle. It simply prevents the egg from implanting should it be fertilized. So odds are, if you usually ovulate on day 14 of your cycle... then you probably did this cycle too and if it was fertilized, it could implant! The best time to have sex is in your fertile window (any day between 3 days before you ovulate to 1 day after you ovulate). So if you are sure you ovulated on Feb. 16th, you had 3 well-timed events to help you get pregnant. You may want to invest in some ovulation kits and even a thermometer in the future just so you can be 100% sure when you ovulate. You might think you ovulate on day 14, but I would hate to have you miss your window if you ovulate a few days earlier than that!<br>  <br>  I know it is a pain to wait to find out if you are pregnant. I have been trying for 16 cycles now and every month, the wait is excruciating! Just remember that even a healthy couple may take up to 1 year to get pregnant. Don't let it get you down if this is not your month. Good luck to you!

kgE96Nhcaa	Unless the MD is worried about miscarriage, cysts, unusual bleeding or pain they will most likely not order another ultrasound until the Ultrascan for genetic disorders between 11-13 weeks.  They have confirmed that it is not ectopic so you don't have a need for one until then.  Then after that you would have one for baby's gender around 17-20 weeks and they usually only order one later than that if they are concerned about fetal distress or fetal growth.  Now all pregnancies are different and so are all doctors but they pretty much need a reason to do an extra one for your insurance.  You could always pay for an extra one if you are worried.|`|yPNvecc7aa	Depends where you live.<br>  In Canada you'll get one a.s.a.p. to determine your dates if you didn't know when your last period was. You'll get one at around 12 weeks if you do testing for abnormalities. <br>  But if you knew your dates, and you don't want to do the testing for abnormalities, your first ultrasound will be at 18 weeks, and your second (and last) at 36 weeks.<br>  <br>  In the states, it seems to be whatever your insurance covers. (I live in Canada so I'm not too knowledgeable about what goes on in the US.)|`|HbciMmROaa	I have already had two..and I am 7 weeks 4 days..|`|98WKYtfwaa	Well i know in the UK they only give you a dating scan at between 12-16weeks and an anomaly scan between 19-22weeks. <br>  <br>  We only get other scans if there is a problem. If everything seems fine with you, they'll give you another abdominal one around 12weeks to determine your due date and so on. Then you'll get your 20week scan and that'll probably be all.
wl7tlYOYaa	You can go to a free clinic to take a test...its free, it doesnt matter how old you are, and you dont need to tell your mom. Without being sure of a pregnancy I wouldnt tell her because its going to freak her out and it might turn out your not pregnant. The weird period might of just been that a weird period. It happens specially when your young. You need to take a test and see what is going on. If your not pregnant I suggest you use condoms to back up the pill that way if you forget it doesnt matter and if the condom breaks you are still protected by the pill.|`|sXU3RrfWaa	you should start by talking to your mum about this, because its the responsible and healthy thing to do.<br>  <br>  if you absolutely cant, you need to go to planned parenthood and get tested or buy a test asap. Dont put it off.<br>  <br>  Its none of my business but if you can manage to take your pill correctly AND you dont want to get pregnant, you need to reconsider if youre ready to be in a sexual relationship.|`|i3FgiLENaa	Maybe you shouldn't have sex unless you want kids..<br>  Oh and man up and tell your mom, be responsible. You sound 14, and if you are that young, then you REALLY shouldn't be having sex
Itk0TYjSaa	Absolutely, it's called implantation bleeding. It is rarely bright red, usually pink or brown but sometimes can be heavier. I bled for one day with each of my three pregnancies right around the time of implantation. Just type in "implantation bleeding" into google or yahoo and you'll see all kinds of info about it.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|3cLE5L7Saa	yeah, implantation bleeding
YP3rEESUaa	its completely normal :)  just try to relax and make sure to eat right and get daily exercise (the exercise will help with labor in the end) and CONGRATS!!!!!|`|EDiJe38Taa	It is perfectly normal. Your hormones are out of whack, and hormones are what cause symptoms. You won't truly "feel" pregnant for a few months. Probably not until you feel the baby move. Good luck!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Pregnancy symptoms are never consistant. Don't keep track of a healthy pregnancy by what symptoms you have and how long you have them because that is not an accurate way to judge how well the pregnancy is doing.
mRGfLpwyaa	SEX- Was it awesome?|`|2xpzhN5faa	The possibility is there.<br>  There's no harm in taking a pregnancy test so do that.|`|X0acKniBaa	I doubt it but think of it as a new wonder in the world if you did. Be happy and just tell your boyfriend if you didn't already. And if he doesn't like it screw him. Hes the stupid one for not wearing protection and he will miss out on alot of fun with the baby.|`|AQ9BfHbRaa	Even if he didn't ejaculate inside you, you can still get pregnant. However, it doesn't happen within hours. Just because you got your period it doesn't mean you aren't pregnant. Wait two to four weeks and take another test.|`|2z3lTB2Raa	if you got your period then you are prob not pregnant. My husband and i have been using the withdrawal method for 3 years and no pregnancy but if he isn't perfect at it then i would either use a condom or go on birth control to make sure it doenst happen|`|5nkcIfKXaa	There is ALWAYS a possibility of pregnancy when you have sex.  Especially unprotected sex.|`|xpstigPTaa	If you got pregnant, you wouldn't have gotten your period!
8t8NjjnVaa	It could take a few days, a few weeks, a few months...it can actually take years for your milk to completely dry up!  <br>  <br>  I could still express a few drops well over a year after I stopped nursing.  My sister could still get milk out two years after she stopped.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	idk i havent breast feed in two + months and i can still lactate|`|ps11uX4Naa	hiya,<br>  i had my little girl 10 weeks ago and never breastfed but i still have some leakage were as with my 1st (i didnt breat feed her either) the milk compleatly dried up with in about a week of me having her, if your worried ask your health visitor <br>  xxx|`|O76KyEOYaa	After my 1st it took 4 years for my milk to stop but after my 2nd it took 3 weeks. Its different for everyone and i wouldnt worry about it, if you are speak to your daughters HV or your GP. Hope this helps.|`|B6m0azAzaa	I was 6 months after I stopped b/f and then got pregnant again and it changed back to colostrum without stopping!
Q05rrSX4aa	Yes, you may not feel too many symptoms yet, because it is so early.  But I do know most women who claim that they "feel pregnant" are.  We know our bodies best.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Nope. Not unless you ovulated when you were on your period. You don't "feel" pregnant from the conception day. You only can start getting pregnancy symptoms once implantation has occured which happens anywhere from 4-16 days past ovulation. <br>  <br>  You are not pregnant hun. You are most likely imagining things.|`|WXExyAlWaa	Two weeks in isn't very long to be feeling symptoms.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	yes, if you had sex after your period. it takes on "average" 10 (give or take a few days)  for your uterus to get itself ready (after the first day of your period ) to hold a child.|`|afAbSq5gaa	Possible but you cant really know until you miss your period and take a pregnancy test<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ztzEloj5aa	when did you have sex??|`|vx18hc0Eaa	Well lets think? did u have any sex? if so then it is very possible|`|YkzPfyp2aa	Due August 26th w/ #2 is correct!<br>  Maybe you have a stomach flu?
WXExyAlWaa	Complete strangers can crave the same things. It's an individual thing, really.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	Must be a coincidence!  My sister just had twins and I am 16 weeks along with my first.  We craved completely different things and I have every pregnancy symptom in the book and she had absolutely none!<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|Kz5Fb0mPaa	Probably coincidence! Or (by old wives tales) you both are having the same sex (either both girls or having both boys). My sister and I have completely different cravings! She had a girl and I find out this week what I'm having (probably a boy)<br>  <br>  Congrats if you are pregnant!
WXExyAlWaa	That is pretty soon, yes. Try not to worry too much - even with unprotected sex the biggest chance is that you're not pregnant, and stressing is only bad for you. If you don't get your next period you can try a home pregnancy test, but otherwise try to assume you'll be okay and make sure to have protection on hand.|`|p3d3E75oaa	just wait it out and see if you miss a period because I could tell you that its a chance you could be or could not be but every womans body is different so good luck
Tjr9aObNaa	Yes, from what i have read, adoption agencies consider people like your family :), only if you are considering international adoption i would be careful, a few i have seen are not keen on couples who have children, they allow them to adopt but sometimes they don't give you 'priority' if you know what i mean. You sound in an ideal situation though. All the best :)|`|HxAyoEQVaa	This is a great thing that you are considering. Help save another life that really wants to be saved. If you do end up wanting another child please persue your goal. You need to get a home study done and their are a few thing to do and have ready for that and that is about it. Good luck.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	If you are considering adoption, you also need to consider the lasting emotional effects of adoption on adopted children and their families. Relinquishment is a trauma referred to as the "Primal Wound" that will have a profound impact on the adoptee.<br>  <br>  Please check out a couple of books on the subject as an introduction into the complex topic.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.enotalone.com/article/4571.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.enotalone.com/article/4571.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nancyverrier.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nancyverrier.com/</a>

Crawling isn't.<br>  <br>  Crawling isn't even mentioned in my favorite pediatric development textbook!<br>  <br>  This seems strange since, of any of these behaviors, crawling is most associated with babies. The truth is many babies never crawl! They do need to find some way to move across the floor. Each will do so at unpredictable times and in distinctive ways. Your grandson may be a scooter, one who likes to stay upright and scoot across the floor on his bottom. Many babies prefer creeping, or wriggling forward on the stomach. Many children will crab-crawl, moving backwards. And, of course, many children will get up on all fours and crawl forward in the traditional way. Each child is unique.<br>  <br>  Some adults are concerned that children who don't crawl in the traditional way will be less coordinated. This is a myth. As long as the baby begins to move across the floor using each arm and each leg, there is no cause for concern.<br>  <br>  I'm reluctant to mention time frames, but somewhere between six and ten months I expect babies to discover some way to move horizontally across the floor to get desired objects. Obstacles to this include the child's not spending enough time on the floor, using an infant walker (which often eliminates the desire to learn crawling behaviors -- infant walkers are bad for proper development), having toys brought to the infant, pushing the child to learn to crawl, and physical problems such as muscle weakness. If babies actually crawl, it usually begins at around 8 to 10 months.|`|3255bf9a56942506a066812fff721579aa	You need to teach her to walk/crawl, don't carry her around all the time. push her along, hold her hands. It could be a medical problem, but she is still pretty young. Its just something you have to socialize into her, and help her build the muscle she needs to be able to walk/crawl. she should be crawling by now.|`|yKS2UI87aa	I put a toy out of reach (one he really liked) but being 10 months old, I would put her in the position and then see if she can get to the toy. Some babies never crawl and go to walking. For the standing we always just used our fingers for him to hold onto and pulled him up. My son could stand when he was only 6 months but needed something to hold onto until he was about 11 months. They have something for parents now not sure of the name but I think it had wings in the name so parents didn't have to kill there back doing it. You could also try a stationary walker has the seat and they can stand or sit in it. My son liked ours from about 5 months Good luck|`|zlAxBOGQaa	i wouldnt worry too much about that<br>  i have a baby cousin and she is 1 years old and about 2 months and she is JUST learning how to walk<br>  just excercise her legs a little bit make her bounce up and down
Qki6UtFSaa	yes it's possible. I had some light cramping just as you described when I was newly pregnant. I've read that it has to do with your organs starting to shift and expand.|`|PfIywLLyaa	I did have serious cramping in early pregnany. My hips ached and so did my legs.|`|hmOidFp3aa	Probably just an early sign of your period!|`|qamxVrV5aa	No I don't think it is an early sign of pregnancy unless you period was late but it could be early sign of you period.|`|VXSjZQc3aa	if your cramping that bad go to the emergency room now! they'll check you out. and tell them if you had unprotected sex. also ask for a blood test.

A lot of women don't start showing until later on in pregnancy. I think I was about 20 weeks or so before I looked noticeably pregnant and not just bloated. A lot of times it depends on your size and shape before pregnancy.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Yes very normal - esp for a first pregnancy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Congrats on feeling movement!!|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	That is very normal for 15 weeks!

And most don't show until after week 20, depending on your body frame and condition.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Yea. Its fine. everyone's body is different. Some people will show earlier, and some people won't show til later like 16-20 weeks.

tcHkn0VIaa	Yes you are already late for you cycle so you are probably pregnant get a test and find out!!!|`|sVPToYvKaa	Yes! I would definitely test now.

cj7sSPZEaa	legally you can not get it without a prescription under the age of 18.  You have to take both pills for it to work properly- the doctor you get it from will tell you how to take it.  It is important to take it correctly.  Why can't you get birth control?  If you are having sex you should be using birth control.  Go to a planned parenthood and get the implant or the ring.  Your parents don't have to know about it.|`|CPwdVc4caa	There's a reason they call Plan B an EMERGENCY contraceptive...it shouldn't be used as just a backup to a condom.  It can cause nausea and vomiting, bleeding, and can really, really screw up your cycle.  Besides, it's prescription only, meaning it requires a doctor's appointment.  Your parents will find out.  Also, $40-$50 seems a bit steep of a price to pay for one night of fun.  <br>  <br>  Planned Parenthood will provide you with free birth control, no questions asked, no parental consent required.  Heck, if you live in the right state, you might be able to get birth control from your school!  You clearly haven't thought this through very thoroughly...
WyQuDaRyaa	Audrey. I use to not like this name..not sure why, just never did. Now I have a friend with a beautiful baby girl named Audrey Willow, and what can I say, the name grew on me. I now love it =)|`|HBgnkltfaa	I know I'm in the minority on this one, but I'm going to pick Rosalind.  They are both fabulous names, though.<br>  <br>  The reasons for my choice:<br>  <br>  -- Rosalind is far less common than Audrey right now.<br>  <br>  -- Rosalind feels more literary.  Most people think Hollywood instead of Shakespeare when they hear the name Audrey.  There's nothing wrong with that, but I like names with that distinctly literary vibe.<br>  <br>  -- Rosalind is definitely the more admirable character in Shakespeare's play.  She is a brave young noblewoman; Audrey is a dimwitted goatherd girl.<br>  <br>  -- Rosalind has more potential nicknames, and I tend to be a nicknamer.<br>  <br>  I think Audrey might be a great choice for someone else (and it's one I recommend often), but Rosalind is the best choice for me.|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Audrey|`|4RAboDSDaa	Audrey|`|Ux0F7WJJaa	Audrey!|`|3255bf9a56942506a066812fff721579aa	I really like Audrey, its pretty.|`|gl4DFLVGaa	AUDREY ALL THE WAY!|`|odm2M1Xwaa	for me it's audrey<br>  <br>  = )|`|ZA5QTj3Zaa	Audrey<br>  <br>  Audrey Hepburn.|`|I8nIewQHaa	Well Audrey is a great name, it fits with a young child or an older woman.

He wanted to make sure that Tyler didn't need a band aid or need to go to the doctor.<br>  <br>  My 3 year old will also ask us "What you do to my brother?" if his brother starts crying.  He will go up to him and kiss him and bring him toys to try to make him feel better.<br>  <br>  It is really great to see him acting like this since he has been rough with him in the past.|`|z7SJaMwuaa	I am the oldest child in my family.

My sister had something wrong with her so she had alot of tubes in her and they kept prickin her fingers and feet for blood and needles.<br>  Any way I was looking in the window and all of the sudden she looked at me and smiled and my parents saw her and I did and she was so cute.

I actually had a check today and I gained 10 pounds in the last 6 weeks!  So, I gained 16 pounds already (now 31 weeks pregnant) and normally I don't gain more then 15 total.  I think it's because I'm so anemic that I don't get exercise like I used to.  It is normal to gain about 25lbs though.  It just depends on your size.  It is good for smaller ladies to gain 30-35 pounds.|`|Eqln1jmNaa	well im not too much further than you are, but im 24 weeks on weds and ive only gained 5 lbs so far, unless i put more on in the last 2 weeks... but as of right now the average weight gain is between "10-20 lbs" so your fine|`|Kz5Fb0mPaa	I am 20 weeks this week and have gained exactly 10 lbs so far!!! The obgyn and nurse say that is good. So I think we are both doing well!!! Congrats!!|`|1o820L3Daa	I gained about 10 pounds at 20 weeks. Now Im 23 weeks its about 13-14.|`|GCPbKg9Eaa	10 lbs thats it!!! wow your doing great!!!
rGci1ehoaa	switch to vitamin d milk... babies need the fat.. I switched my son at 10 months. Make sure you are also giving her food rich in nutrients!! My son weighed the same at 1 yr old.. he is a very picky eater.. make sure you have her try the food 3-4 times as everything is new and they may reject it the first 2 times but then end up liking it alot!!|`|AA12339451	Cow's milk has protein for strength and growth, calcium for strong bones and teeth, and vitamins A and D for eyes and bones. Children older than one year should have two or three 8-oz servings of milk every day. Yogurt and cheese are also good dairy foods for children.<br>  <br>  Babies should not drink cow's milk. After they turn one year old, most children should drink whole milk for at least one year. The fat in milk helps children grow and helps their brains to develop. If you have an overweight child, ask your doctor about using 2 percent milk. Toddlers should not drink nonfat or skim milk.<br>  <br>  Some children drink too much milk, especially if they use a bottle instead of a cup. Try to get your child to drink 2 cups of milk each day, then add variety with other healthy dairy foods.|`|2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	She should be on whole milk until she is 2.  She's needs the extra fat in whole milk to help her brain and body grow.|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	She should not be on 1% or even 2%.<br>  <br>  She should be on whole homogenized milk, babies need whole milk, not low fat.|`|3HR1SfGMaa	You should switch her to whole milk.  My daughter was taken off formula at age 1 and she drank whole milk until age 2, even with that she is still barely heavy enough to be considered a healthy weight.  That baby needs more fat!!|`|3kJom1Eraa	I think you should switch to whole milk asap.|`|AA10624857	I am surprised that your pediatrician didn't have you switch her to whole cow's milk. It is most typical to have babies between 12-24 months drink full fat homogonized Vitamin D milk. The fat content is beneficial to proper growth and development, especially in the brain. I think if you buy her whole milk and give her 16-24 ounces per day along with a healthy, well-balanced diet that she'll be fine. It is very normal for babies to reach around 12 months and suddenly seem not to eat very much. The rate of growth slows considerably. Think about what a newborn baby looks like and then what a 12 month old looks like. Quite a change. While the difference in a 12 month old and a 24 month old is not so much physical growth as it is intellectual growth. I suggest you give her whole milk and wait to give her 2% or 1% after her second birthday.|`|3NyM1cq5aa	She needs whole milk until at least 2 years of age.
FTW82Wumaa	Hi there!<br>  If you're like me, you wanna make sure you're "normal" and on track belly wise. I really really like the website <a href="http://www.i-am-pregnant.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.i-am-pregnant.com</a><br>  I like it for a few reasons. First of all, you get your own little profile page almost like a myspace page. You also have tons of forums to read up on for everything you could imagine related to pregnancy. <br>  They also have photo galleries for ultrasound pictures and belly pictures! You can kinda see how all different people show at all different times. It's pretty cool.<br>  And as for me, I'm 11 weeks and starting to get a little bump but no one really can see it except me.<br>  Good luck!|`|0J0A7HqCaa	Every women is different.  I started showing at NO LIE about 10 weeks.  Just a little though but you could tell I was pregnant.  I am short, 5 feet so I have no belly room.  That could have been why I showed early.  But through out my pregnancy my stomach always measured bigger than it should have.  My daughter was 9lbs 2oz.  She was big!!!!|`|8Cvv86Jeaa	Usually you wont start showing until the fourth month. This is what everyone says. But I started showing in the third. Depends on how small you are. Everybody is different.You wont be BIG until about the 6 month though.|`|sIr2fWh6aa	I started showing at 8 weeks, but every body is different.  It depends on your height/weight pre-pregnancy, the amount of fluid you have in your belly, if you're in shape or not.. etc.  Everyone is different, though.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Everyone's different. but generally they say you can start showing at twelve weeks. I starting showing alittle around that time. I am now fifteen weeks, and I am getting quite a big belly already. good luck.|`|a9ad5fb472d76ac52689ca11de1f2cc4aa	I felt I was showing around three and a half month but other people didn't really notice or comment till I was around 5 months.  So I guess around 5 months, you can be showing.|`|BX4Ja1Rgaa	it is hard to give an exact science as to when cause we are all different and show at different times of the pregnancy.|`|3gVPMjURaa	around 5 months|`|wphI41wNaa	Its different for every women I didnt start showing till I was about five months or so|`|TCzvigiuaa	It really depends on you...but its usually around 16 weeks.|`|QSodlfMraa	every one is different but from 17 weeks up or maybe 6 months.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	anywhere from 16-22 weeks most likely.|`|UaL28atDaa	Take a look at this i think you will find it really useful. Its a week by week guide to your pregnancy so you can know what to expect from each week. It will also tell you which week to expect showing and as a first time mum lots of other useful things about pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/video/watch/100090/Pregnancy_Weeks_1_to_4?YAFT" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/...</a>|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	every person is different i started showing at 16 weeks<br>  <br>  EDIT: <br>  OK This is weird i was 140 and am 5'0 before pregnancy...|`|jgtfWjE4aa	depends on your size<br>  i'm petite and i started showing at 16 weeks.|`|jQCmJQrtaa	usually around 16 weeks +
VukTbsCUaa	would say ultrasound.|`|c7f419243c5a31e1118c95c6e72ce929aa	Ultrasounds measure a "generic" type of measurement. In other words...where the baby should be at a certain gestational age. Although they are not always accurate. 11 days doesn't seem like a huge jump. Remember, babies come when they want to so don't depend on your due date.
3Zad0UuWaa	The doctors do not start counting the days until the egg is implanted in the uterus wall. Which can take up to a couple of weeks if im correct  So if you got pregnant on the 7th, the due date would be around June 13-15. Not really a specific date, but hey thats what happened to my cousin. You have to also take into consideration that you dont count sep. You start with october.
0F9b6g5vaa	subchronich heamatoma is a clott between placenta and uterus wall  they found mine at 6wks and it was only small like 10cm by 4 1/2 cm and by the time i got to 12 wks it had reabsorbed did they tell you how big yours was i did have lots of spotting for a few weeks befor it must have gone but i did look on the net and alot of people do go on and have normal pregnancy with bleeds here and there but just follow there advice and rest and it said no sex on the net aswell good luck hopefully yours may go away by itself too|`|qayCggxMaa	See the following website, which I think is what you are talking about:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazingpregnancy.com/pregnancy-articles/191.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazingpregnancy.com/pregnanc...</a>|`|9a3sNrEqaa	Hey hun. It sounds like you may have what I have. Its a subchorionic hematoma or it can be a hemorrhage. Its a tiny clot that forms b/w your placenta and uterine wall and when it bleeds out it can be called a hemorrhage. I have to go for an ultrasound every week so they can monitor it. I asked a simmilar ? a week ago and many women said they had it and went on to have a perfectly healthy baby. I can tell you not to worry, but we are pregnant women and we WILL worry! But the best thing you can do is just try to take it easy. GOOD LUCK HUN!!!!!!!!
JXB5pI7Aaa	Actually, your 'any lawyer' would be wrong.<br>  <br>  The United States has signed reciprocal agreements with a number of countries to enforce child support orders.<br>  <br>  If you happen to have moved to a country which the US does not have an agreement with, it's a relatively simple matter to call the Consular Services in the country of question and arrange for legal counsel to have the order enacted in that country.

Attitude Personality Advice, anything that rubs you the wrong way, when you come to him or her for advice or treatment. <br>  If you feel that your doctor is condescending to you and talks down to you like you are unable to understand what he or she is talking about.

yQDxgLBPaa	You should go get the plan B pill that's what it's for when your in situations like this! You don't even need a prescription for it she needs to go to any pharmacy and ask them for plan B. It's about 50.00 or 60.00 dollars. If you don't have the money if she can get ah old of 2 birth control pills take them both at ones should do the job. She may feel sick after but hey it's better then getting prego! Good luck!|`|0xWAHvKYaa	Chances are very likely<br>  You can actually get pregnant while ON your period because sperm can live up to 3 days<br>  Best advice, go to your local pharmacy and ask for Plan B (the morning after pill) you are supposed to take it within the first 72 hours after having unprotected sex and the sooner you take it the more effective it will be.<br>  If you don't have enough money for Plan B then taking 2-3 birth control pills is the same as taking plan B....BUT you are putting a lot of hormones into your body so it may make you feel sick|`|Xf28j1Eeaa	Well it really depends on what day she ovulated if she ovulates on day 1 4 of her cycle and her period lasts 7 days there should be no chances at all because a woman starts to be more fertile around the time she ovulates.

Wb9oqcWDaa	My husband and I went through the same thing.  You just have to make time for it.  Put the kids to bed one night when he is at home and do something romantic together that will lead to more intimate things.<br>  If that doesn't work I watch Oprah occasionally and I saw an episode on this subject and a relationship therapist said to schedule in time for each other and this specific reason.  Make it a time when the kids are in bed or when you can get a sitter either for a few hours or over night.  Then play with it, send emails or texts about how you can't wait or what you want to do to him etc.  That will spice it up and make you both excited for the time.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	You're doing pretty good by sending love notes - but after midnight is too late for any mom.   During nap time is a good time to reconnect - not late at night, at night my husband and I tell each other the best and worst about our day so that we can listen to each other and check it, it takes 10 minutes at most and is pretty easy, and it's a great way to keep the marriage bond up to date - making it easier to "reconnect" when you have time and energy.<br>  <br>  P.S.  He doesn't care if you're a mess.  At all.|`|AA11476951	Sometimes it's really hard and men have a hard time understanding "mommy mode" and think it means we love our kids more. Sometimes you just have to make that switch turn back on or just fake it. Sorry but it's true. Your husband needs you to turn mommy mode off and if you can't... pretend you did!|`|28QPS6V9aa	One day a week get a babysitter and go on a date with your husband. That's what my husband and I do and it's the best day of my week. I always look forward to it. Go to dinner and maybe a movie. The time alone together without kids helps a lot! Or if you just want to be intimate in a more physical way, take your kids to a babysitter for a few hours and while they're gone relax at home with your hubby. Buy something sexy and light candles. It always works for us. But I understand how you feel. Sometimes it's hard for us to find time to be intimate too, but the dates really help a lot!
tcHkn0VIaa	at 28 weeks the average baby weighs 2.5 pounds so the baby may be a little large or the ultra sound could be inaccurate which is defiantly a possibility.

UkQuMykiaa	I just had my twins 4 weeks ago today.  I went into labor at home and at first wasn't sure it was the real thing - this was the first pregnancy I actually went into labor on my own. My symptoms: first, despite what my dr said I believe I did lose my mucus plug about four days before. second, my contractions started in my lower back, my lower abdomen would tighten and I had aching dull pain in my upper back thighs.  Very strange and that was why I was not sure.  The only thing that clued me in a little was that once I noticed this I started timing my contractions and they went from 5 minutes apart to three minutes apart and after my water broke 1 minute apart (most people I know don't have their water break, but it has happened to me at home three of my four pregnancies).  Good luck and I hope this helps.  If you are EVER in doubt and you think you are in real labor - call your dr. or go to the ER.  Never feel bad about doing that - even if you really aren't in labor. I went by ambulance to the hospital this time and within 30 - 40 I went from being dilated to a 4 to a full 10.<br>  <br>  Congrats to you :o)|`|UaL28atDaa	Why don't you take a look at this to give you an idea of what labor will be like and you may get a better idea of whats happening.

ZbnxGIsnaa	Yes, cramping is perfectly normal in your first trimester in particular as it's the most critical time for your uterus to grow for the baby.  Especially for new Moms.  Gotta stretch you out, don't ya know?  *smiles*<br>  <br>  You can always take Tylenol as that's okay to take while pregnant.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Yup. Light to moderate period like cramps are normal. it's your uterus growing and stretching to accommodate your baby. If they get really strong and you start to bleed that's when you worry.|`|DXLfbKUBaa	Yes normal, i got cramps for the whole 9 months seemed to be every month when i should have been due a period, you will wake up in the morning and the cramps will be gone, try not to worry as stress is not good in pregnancy.

If they get really severe and/or are accompanied by bleeding, that's when you need to be concerned. If that happens, contact your OB. And congrats! :]|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Perfectly normal!

Yes it's normal, so don't worry. It's only your uterus stretching and growing. Little muffin will be taking up a lot of space in there eventually, so the uterus has to prepare..Just to prepare you, you'll possibly experience these stretchings and crampings throughout your pregnancy, but you'll learn to get used to them!|`|8uiH6iRbaa	congratulations x<br>  <br>  it's perfectly normal and they feel like period pains so they can be warring and confusing.<br>  <br>  just to put your mind at rest mention it to your doctor when you see him/her ( i assume you probably have an appointment booked)<br>  <br>  rest plenty and increase your fluid intake and to help with the cramps use a hot water bottle make it up so that its warm, not hot i did this and it helped <br>  <br>  good luck x<br>  <br>  p.s there will plenty more cramps and aches and pains to come lol but its all worth it x|`|JDw1RDcaaa	very normal, and you will get worse pain than that though the pregnancy but you will realise what is normal and what isnt.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  x|`|9a3sNrEqaa	yes hun! they can feel veryyyy simmilar to AF cramps.

Od73sfkxaa	He may of have mixed feelings about the pregnancy, which is normal...especially for guys. One day he may be excited and feel fine with the idea, the next day he realizes just how life changing this is going to be...BUT he thinks about the negative aspects.<br>  <br>  He needs to realize; however, that life rarely goes the way we have planned. Which isn't always a bad thing, but learning to "go with the flow" is a hard lesson to learn but a very important one.<br>  <br>  I gave up a lot of stuff to be with my husband, but that's not the way I thought things would be (gave up a management position to move out here, a scholarship, all of my friends and family). BUT we are now happily married (+1 year), we have decents cars, and we just bought a house and we''re trying to conceive. I am finally able to go to college, I still visit my family and friends, it's just that things took a different turn then what I expected...and actually, I have more than most of my friends (husband, house, etc)<br>  <br>  Also..Let him know that you didn't do this on purpose, and that it is life changing experience for you as well. Is there anything that this baby might put on "hold" for you? If so, let him know. There will be hard times, and fun times. When you struggle in life, especially over a child...it's well worth it. You guys are now a family. <br>  <br>  ___<br>  <br>  Tips:<br>  <br>  Just talk to him about how you feel as well, let him know he's not the only one this is affecting.<br>  <br>  Continue to pick out baby names, furniture, ideas for a nursery, etc.<br>  <br>  Bring him to the ultrasound, even if he has to ask a day off of work. He needs to see the little baby on the screen, and realize that this is his child, and that it is all worth it.<br>  <br>  Continue to include him...he will warm up to the idea.<br>  <br>  I wish you both the best of luck with everything that you do....<br>  <br>  ...and congratulations!!|`|ojVl4Gowaa	Everyone has different reactions. My own reaction was one of mixed emotions, sad and happy but when we heard the heartbeat me and my hubby couldn't stop smiling. And the first ultrasound? We both cried when we saw her profile on the screen. It felt more real, and then you don't even think things like "my life is over". It's like falling in love, both of you will be so excited.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your fiance has mixed emotions, just try not to let it stress you out and share your fears with him too to let him know he's not alone in this. Congrats!|`|iKPSOMiSaa	if he keeps being selfish and putting extra stress on you , you need to show him what he can loose and leave. you need love and support when expecting. he'll think its the best thing that couldve ever happened when the baby is born|`|a6e7SRYzaa	That's crap. Fine people have bad days, but if anything he actually did this to you seeing as you are pregnant. Tell him to stop PMS'ing and grow up.|`|6PEOqeLOaa	He might just be having a bad day..i never experienced that but then again doesnt mean he didnt feel the same way he just may not of shared it with me. Don't get down try to cheer him up let him know you love him, but also let him know that his reaction is concerning you maybe he doesnt exactly know how he is coming off..just talk to him he's your fiance you two can talk..good luck and congrats!|`|yKS2UI87aa	May have something to do with his friends. My guy will try that being rude crap if his friends are there and I don't put up with it and am either rude back or call him on it|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Okay, my husband didn't react like that, saying that I burned him, that's pretty ridiculous. But, he did go through a shocked/scared stage where he freaked out a little bit. Even though that was a pretty mean thing to say, he's probably just scared right now. I would give him some time, and talk to him about it if he wants to. Let him know how you are feeling as well. Good luck to you guys!<br>  <br>  And on a side note, this might make you feel better. My husband and I were actually trying for a baby, and when I got a positive pregnancy test after the first try and told him, the first thing he said was, "F**K!" I was so mad at the time! But I think it just really hit him that this was really happening and it was way faster than he thought it would happen. We are both super excited now and can laugh about it. So don't worry, I'm sure he'll come around! A few weeks later when we got to hear the heartbeat, my husband had tears in his eyes and has been in love with this baby ever since. :]|`|gHUalk8Xaa	I don't know...did you do this on purpose? If the pregnancy was an "accident" of course you're going to be blamed. You can't do anything about it now, what's done is done. He needs to snap out of it and decide whether to man up or leave.
yp9rEMSraa	Hello, yes TTC #1 can be confusing especially if you have irregular periods...I have irregular periods and my ovulation changes from month to month so it does make it harder to try and hit the right day...so don't get discouraged if it takes a little while due to your irregular periods....<br>  Types of Testing:<br>  Ovulation Test sticks-these sticks you buy usually in a pack of 7 or ten...after you period you start testing...the stick are suppose to tell you when you are ovulating...when the results come back with two lines you would baby dance...<br>  Basal Temp method- you measure your temp and keep it charted...when your temp is raised you would do the baby dance...sometimes it is hard to tell this way if you have a fever, did something differently that day etc...I would not recommend this method but some women do use this method..<br>  Websites-there are some websites out there you put your day of your last period and how many days your cycle is...when you put that in it will tell you when you are suppose to be the most fertile....for you since you have irregular periods i would take a good day range (say your period ranges from 28 days to 35 days)...whatever the weeks are that they say you are the most fertile do the baby dance...you will be having sex a lot though cause your weeks of being fertile will range over a two or three week period cause your period...<br>  CM fluid testing-I don’t know much about this one cause I just can’t bring myself to measure this but....your CM fluid when you are ovulating will be like an egg white...basically when it gets like that you would do the baby dance....they say your cervix’s shifts and it is moist...<br>  Ovulation monitoring- these are monitors that are like the ovulation sticks but once you pee on the stick you put it into a monitor....it will read it and tell you whether you are ovulating or not...it measures in by low high and peak....whenever it is at the high days or peak days you do the baby dance...for some reason if you can’t conceive within 6 months you can get a print out of the results and can take it to your doctor for his record....<br>  <br>  I don’t know which one will be the easiest for you or the best...women have conceived using all of the above techniques so it is going to be based on you and your body...Best of luck to you and baby dust!|`|c7f419243c5a31e1118c95c6e72ce929aa	Since you have an irregular period your best bet would probably be ovulation predictor kits to see if you are even ovulating. Don't assume that you're ovulating just because you're having a period whether it be regular or irregular. It's called anovulation and your body will flush the lining of your uterus regardless of ovulation. <br>  <br>  Also you can try checking cervical position and cervical mucus. I have been using this method and it took about a month to understand it and know what I was looking for, but it seems easiest for me. I have posted a couple of links below for things you can do.|`|Wzws8v8daa	i have irregular periods too, and after trying for months and months and nothing working, i finally went to see a fertility specialist and he told me that irregular periods almost always means not ovulating!  so i am starting on fertility medication (clomid) this month to make my body ovulate. if i were you, i would certainly go talk to a doctor asap since you have irregular periods you are most likely not ovulating!
OMYgUs1Saa	The best time to try is around or just after ovulation.Ovulation is around the 14th day into a woman's cycle and the cycle will start when she starts her monthly period. However it is still possible to get pregnant while even on your period as sperm stays alive for up to 7 days and you only need one sperm to become pregnant.|`|YWA8w7Ndaa	take these steps first-<br>  <br>  buy her a baseball glove<br>  locate a near by baseball field<br>  explain to her how to use a baseball glove<br>  <br>  once youve dont all this take her to the field, but her in the middle of it, put the glove on her hand, tell her to hold her hand up and wait. im sure she'll "catch" it by the end of the day.<br>  <br>  oh. and remember. determination and perseverance is key. :]<br>  <br>  ahhahahha. "catch pregnant"...whooo.|`|AA12231679	apart from not catching pregnancy, a woman is fertile about 14 days after her last period, usually from the first day of the last period and usually fertile for about 3 days.<br>  <br>  ALL timings are only approximate and should not be used for contraceptive purposes!!!<br>  <br>  Oh, and she has to have sex!|`|bIn8GDa8aa	right after lunch. especially if u had peanut butter and jelly. <br>  :)|`|3AXlgGgUaa	When someone nearby sneezes.|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	10-14 days after her period stops.|`|rftEZA50aa	pregnancy isn't the flu you know!<br>  <br>  "catch pregnant".. tut|`|AA12030056	dude have u had sex ed, u dont catch it|`|EV5Ekcsgaa	when she is with someone else|`|kaqPSgTVaa	pregnancy isn't contagious. But a woman usually can get pregnant when she ovulates anywhere from 11-16 days into her cycle.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	The best time to GET pregnant is when you are living on your own with financial stability and you are in a strong, loving relationship.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	catch it ? Like the flu ? 14 days after she had her period first day so if she started on the first the 14 day she might catch it|`|50lIaC8zaa	A woman's most fertile time is 14 - 16 days from the first day of her period.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	catch pregnant lol i like that. but i think around 5 pm usually : )|`|7utsLRfyaa	you cant catch prenancy
AA10632588	My mom always told me it didn't matter where we come from, what was important was that the souls that were meant to be together found each other.|`|DJMPQlFDaa	Well my kindergarten teacher offered to adopt me and asked my mom if she could. I even asked my mom if she could. But my mom didn't let her. I think I would have had a better life if I was adopted out. <br>  My mother became very verbally abusive towards me. Her favorite thing to call me was a b*tch. and that was by the time I was 5 years old. If it wasn't that she was going to blow her head off in front of me or have me watch her jump in front of an eighteen wheeler.<br>  I had lead poisoning as an infant and I had a delay in my speech. And my mother hated the fact my father favored me over her. My mother made it clear to me that she could only love her sons she never wanted a daughter. I was suppose to be still born. She actually tried to kill herself while she was pregnant with me. She overdosed on her anti-psychic medication and her pain medication. I was imformed the only reason she wanted custody of me was for child support and income tax money.<br>  <br>  I am for adoption if it is because of abuse but against it if it is not.|`|993127072b7a2a0e8c555efdb241a674aa	i was 'given away' as you say. i have had an issue or two over the years with it, but in my case being given away was what saved my life. (very long story, not meant for this question)<br>  <br>  adoption CAN be a good thing...im living proof. there are a few situations that it is done for the right reasons and the right people. <br>  but the amount of lies and unethical procedures sours the pot for everyone.|`|PBSM8uDwaa	It would depend on the age I was given away.  If it was when I was too young to remember, it wouldn't bother me much as long as I went to a good home.  Although, my friend had to give his niece up for adoption.  She's only eight.  Imagining the confusion and heartbreak she's probably feeling is terrible.|`|8OREBeRdaa	I'm adopted, I was adopted a week after I was born.  I never met my birth parents but I intend to look this year.  I have no problem with it.  My current parents did a great job raising me. <br>  <br>  I think adoption is fine as long as the the adoptee doesn't remember and it's to a good home.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	I am adopted.  It feels like hell to be given away to strangers.  I've been dealing with it for 30 years, and the pain never lessens.  I'm sure there are people who will have a rose tinted view of adoption.  I'm totally not one of them.|`|sbnlqrsoaa	I was adopted and it is great! I am 16 and recently came into contact with my family. I litteraly have two families. If I get sick of one, I can go to the other!|`|JP04HX6maa	I *was* given away.<br>  <br>  Sure, I have a great family, but it doesn't change the fact that I was GIVEN UP BY MY OWN MOTHER in order to gain this family.|`|6L9jJnchaa	I WAS "given away."  My b-mother did what was best for her, and that was getting rid of me, lol.  Do I hold a grudge against her for it?  NO WAY.  I was put with much better parents, and my life was better for it. How could I possibly be bitter about that?<br>  <br>  I have had a relationship with her for the last 2 years...don't criticize her at all for her decision.|`|zLoyo24Taa	I was adopted and I am happy that I was raised with a great family. Not everyone who is adopted feels this way, but all experiences are different.|`|HmkCFddAaa	Being an adopted person I don't have any problems with it. I have never felt unwanted, rejected or any of those things. I have always know I was adopted. I was going on 3 by the time my second adoption was finalized. I think adoption is a good and necessary part of life, as some can't parent, some simply don't want to, and some should never be allowed to raise children. My parents also had foster kids so I saw a lot growing up. Some good some bad and some down right horrible, as far as why the kids were in foster care.<br>  Everyone has their own feelings on this. Some can't get past it and others have no problems. To me it is simply a part of my life that makes me who I am today, a strong independent woman who has ups and downs in life just like anyone else.|`|27fcbd4a2b0b4c5a2c64b68f6be0547faa	It sucks to be given away.<br>  Nothing I ever do will EVER make me feel 'good enough' - because even my own mother decided that I wasn't good enough to keep.<br>  <br>  Intellectually - I know better.<br>  But deep in my soul - it hurts to my core.<br>  <br>  The truth about adoption - <br>  <a href="http://www.cubirthparents.org/booklet.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cubirthparents.org/booklet.pd...</a>|`|3X4i5Whvaa	Like hell.<br>   I knew when I was pregnant with my son that If I were forced to part with him that he would feel rejected. He would grow up not knowing that I had fought to keep him, and that I wanted him.<br>  <br>  And I knew that it would hurt me, too.Losing a child to adoption hurts the mother as well. <br>  <br>  My own parents engineered the adoption, along with the "help" of a corrupt agency...and the abandonment by my child's father. By law, my child had no "legal father."In reality, his father had a college degree and a good job. But he didn't want to support him. At that time, there was no legal way to force it.<br>  <br>  People try to "pretty up" adoption with nice-sounding words, but it hurts.<br>  <br>  21 years later, I found him and told him what happened.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Not so bad if i had been raised by loving parents. I believe a family doesn't just have to be blood.
ciz0qYwnaa	Well, there are two 'skinnys' I believe. <br>  <br>  The first is the naturally thin. Those people are, obviously, naturally thin. They eat normally and they might exercise or not, but either way their bodies don't retain fat very easily. The disadvantages are being considered an anorexic ALL THE TIME even when not, being told to eat more even tho they eat a ton, sometimes not even finding the right sized dress or top or jeans at a certain store. <br>  <br>  The second is the group of girls who willingly inflict terrible hatred and pain, both physical and emotional, upon their bodies. I was in this group, I sometimes feel as though I still am in it. It's horrible. All you can think of is food, calories, grams of fat, bad foods, good foods, negative-calorie foods, exercise, being fat... The bad points are pretty obvious: mental torture; plus your entire body starts sort of decaying. Your teeth turn yellow and if you have bulimia, they start to erode. People can start seeing the bones of your body; your spine, your ribs, your collarbone, your hipbones... It's not something pretty to see. You become very moody. Friends leave you, get away from you, think you're a weirdo. You start losing it. You develop strange habits; you cut your meals into small pieces even if it's just a salad, you chew then spit your food. You can't sleep very well at night. The list goes on and on. You will lose fat, yes, but in the wrong places. Your boobs *might* melt away, your bf will tell you to eat more, other guys won't want to go out with you because there's nothing to hug, you're just a sack of bones. At a very advanced stage death is probable and possible.|`|R47Bj9Q6aa	if your just skinny : <br>  people think you have an eating disorder<br>  some guys arent attracted to skinny girls and like curves<br>  hard to find clothes that fit<br>  <br>  if your too skinny : <br>  you have a mental disorder<br>  you have health problems<br>  you could die|`|RoTLnFGZaa	Skinny Isn't Cute; Slim is Cute.

d8fSVX23aa	I am sorry that you found yourself in such a terrible situation to have to make such a hard choice at such a young age. As you are interested to find out other women's views why not contact any abortion clinics to see if there is any women groups to talk to who have been through the same thing to share your feelings with. It would have to be better than this site and the judgmental people on here. You are right that women should feel comfortable to talk of such things without everyone getting on their soap boxes.<br>  <br>  From a mother who fortunately has never been in the situation of having to make that sort of decision.|`|Px79AEXtaa	no,i never had one.  i think when i was 15 if i had gotten pregnant, i would have had an abortion.  but, knowing what i know now, i wouldn't. i couldn't... but i will defend your right to one...it's your body, your baby.|`|ixD2RnqTaa	My sister has had 3 abortions.

Well I had an abortion when I was 15 too. Reasoning was because 1. I was immature&careless& I let my mom&boyfriend talk me into it, literally the day after up until I found out I was pregnant again I would seriously think about it all the time & feel so horrible& it literally affected my everyday life. Well now I'm 18, 11 weeks pregnant & I'm still with the same boyfriend & it was totally planned. We graduated highschool, freshmens in college, we work 2 jobs & everything is just in order! So that's that. I don't think my reason for getting an abortion is a good enough reason, because its like living a statistic. So I do regret it, but I have put it in the past, because I have to focus on myy baby on the way, I'm just greatful god gave me a 2nd chance, at such a young age to be a mommy again, so I can't mess this up! Well I appreciate you coming out & telling a brief of your story, always feels well knowing your not the only one that has gone through something like that! Well goodluck in your future pregnancies & all that (:|`|58XjVRFPaa	my mom had one with my little brother/sister.<br>  she didnt go through with the pregnancy because it was from a night fling type thing.<br>  if she did have the baby, it would be around 7 years old now D;<br>  <br>  my mom had a really hard time when it came time to get the abortion and almost ran away, but still had it done anyways. <br>  <br>  after she had the abortion she was depressed for awhile and would cry alot when she was alone (or when she though she was). <br>  <br>  now she has almost completely forgotten about it|`|I8nIewQHaa	Yes I have. I was 15 as well. It was more my parents choice then mine. My mother told me it was the only choice and there was no way I could keep the baby. She now tells me how sorry she was that she made me do it. I was dating a guy that was a jerk! I was only dating him to make my ex jealous who just hated this guy. Well he liked to have sex allllll the time! One day I really didn't want to but did anyway and he said he wore a condom but didn't. So months later when things felt strange... oh boy! So I went to my mom and she starting crying. I had it done, and after felt terrible. I still do and it's almost 11 years later. I don't wish I could have changed things, because like you said I could not bring a baby in the world then. That's it!|`|EFGKxSsVaa	i honestly don't see what's so wrong about having an abortion.<br>  some girls, like this one, obviously wasn't ready to be a mom, nor was she ready to care for the baby, NOT BECAUSE SHE DIDNT WANT TO, BUT BECAUSE SHE DIDNT HAVE THE FREAKING OPITION. she probably didnt even have a job at 15! shes like in her freshmen year old highschool.

If you act like his disability is weird then it won't help him. If you treat him normal like you seem to that's good. That you say you admire it is even better. I wouldn't mind being with someone that was deaf, I've got a million questions I'd ask if I was close to someone like that. I think you're a wonderful girlfriend and if it makes him smile, then how can it possibly be bad?

Imagine being 16 and called apple but being pear shaped?<br>  <br>  Heavenly Hirani Tiger lily is one that Paula yates called her kids as well as Peaches, Pixie, Fifi Trixabelle.<br>  <br>  Cruel.|`|8gWftZQpaa	no..i don't like it..I think they only do it b/c they're in the spotlight...I think it's just wrong|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Nope. Silly|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	no|`|JU351q6Naa	Most of them i hate. Some however i adore.<br>  These are the ones i like:<br>  Maddox Chivan Jolie-Pitt<br>  Pax Thien Jolie-Pitt<br>  Zahara Marley Jolie-Pitt<br>  Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt<br>  Knox Léon Jolie-Pitt<br>  Vivienne Marcheline Jolie-Pitt<br>  Harlow Winter Kate Madden<br>  Kingston James McGregor Rossdale (even though Kingston is unsual i like it but would never name my kid that)<br>  Emme (Jennifer Lopez)<br>  Violet Anne Affleck (my best celeb baby name)<br>  <br>  Ones i hate so much:<br>  Zuma Nesta Rock Rossdale<br>  Bronx Mogwli Wentz<br>  Princess Tiaamii Andre<br>  Junior Savva Andre<br>  Pilot Inspector<br>  <br>  <br>  At least some of the names are normal like Sean Preston and Jayden James (dont like the names but they are normal which is good)|`|rUPjr7hjaa	Generally, no.<br>  How can anyone named Apple be taken seriously when she's older?  I think it's awful to give your children ridiculous names.|`|gu1sEQN8aa	Cant stand it...I like the normal names like Sarah Jessica Parker named her boy James...nice and normal!  I do kinda like Nicole Kidmans daughters Sunday Rose|`|OXxKTM6vaa	They name their kids some pretty outragous things. I personally wouldn't. It wouldn't suprise me if they did it just for the front page of the sun!!|`|yv94euDBaa	Quite often I do. I like Knox, Apple and Tallulah. Only I liek Apple as a middle name.|`|AA10300538	yes. it gives us entertainment, something to laugh about!<br>  hahaha, like Pilot Inspector!|`|AaXl3vcCaa	well not all celebs pick weird names like that just as many of them have normal names|`|gl4DFLVGaa	Umm...I do find them a bit akward....|`|4a27eb7f77cfbe149ec481259486fc8aaa	I like Knox, I've actually wanted to name a boy that for a long time (way before Brangelina had the twins) bu probably won't now because it's a "celebrity baby name."  Some people have used normal names that are just fine, like Violet Affleck, Connor and Isabella Kidman-Cruise, Jennifer Lopez's twins Max & Emme, even Kingston isn't bad (Gwen Stefani's oldest).  Britney Spears didn't do too horribly with Sean Preston and Jayden James.  I don't really like Jayden but at least it's a real name.<br>  <br>  Not a fan of most of the others, i.e. Apple, Tallulah, Bronx Mowgli, Zuma.  Ridiculous.  And every time I hear about Suri Cruise I want to sing "Surrey with the Fringe on Top" from Oklahoma.|`|9y4mUvaFaa	i think some of the names are cute my favorutie would be:<br>  <br>  Honor ---- jess alba and cash warrens wee girl ---- this is super cute<br>  Harlow --- Nicole Richie and Joel Maddens girl ---- cuper cute as well<br>  Emme --- j.lo and mark Antonys girl --- v cute!!<br>  Kingston and Zuma --- gwen stefani and gavin rossdales boys!!<br>  <br>  i also think celebs choose names that everyday people couldnt pull off lol like Tallulah or  Diesel and Denim. some are just plain weird lol|`|ZA5QTj3Zaa	For the most part, no.  Although the kid will be able to get away with it better than anyone that I know because their parents are famous/rich.<br>  <br>  I feel sorry for not famous kids whose mothers copy the names.  They will get beaten up at school.|`|ln0wLqZhaa	Alot of them are really bad , Some are okay .|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Sometimes. I do like Shiloh, Vivienne, Violet, and Harlow. Apple, Seraphina, Bronx and *insert any other weird name here* - not so much.|`|3255bf9a56942506a066812fff721579aa	I really do. Don't give a damn about the celebrities, but the names they choose are often very unique, and I really like unique names.|`|kLoICJJjaa	most of them are awful.......... because they want to be 'different' just because they think they are better than everyone else............ (not all celebs.......... just the stuck up ones)|`|J1ziLHTGaa	Yeh, i like most of them.. <br>  From your examples i do like Knox and Tallulah though apple not so much dont hate it though.|`|be40588ae7c28e63b468da0087e4f8f9aa	Not at all. I actually feel sorry for their children!|`|IZUi93oeaa	simply No!!|`|d07861561c1ae1f3be24fc58fcebdcf5aa	only when its normal|`|4cM3njVOaa	nope.
lGcpXteaaa	I think it would be brilliant and always go for the medela range. <br>  If it is a little out of your price range..then go for the medela 3 in 1. It worked really well for me! I only paid 100 bucks for it!<br>  <br>  If you plan on exclusively pumping then go for the Symphony, if not and plan on occasional pumping go for the 3 in 1. <br>  Its small easy and great for people who have a hard time pumping..No other make worked for me.<br>  <br>  Heres a link to have a look on what will suit you better. <a href="http://www.medelabreastfeedingus.com/products/breast-pumps" rel="nofollow">http://www.medelabreastfeedingus.com/pro...</a>|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	That's a crazy amount to spend on a breast pump!  You can look at electric pumps online at www.babiesrus.com and www.target.com along with other places.  They both had some medela models for $200-something to $300-something.  And i found a couple that had very good ratings.  If you get one of these, you won't know what i'm missing i'm sure.  I'd hate to rent something that would cost me that much more because if i wanted to buy it and couldn't afford it, i would know that there was a difference between that and the target/babiesrus one!  At least look at these others! $1500 is crazy to spend on a pump!|`|rFRo6DGTaa	I have a 6 months baby girl and i'm exclusively pumping, I use the medela swing, its a single pumps, I had the medela double pump and I returned it, it was too much work to double pump, I know it takes longer with a single, but I can pump and still have a free hand to take care of my daughter, when you double you have to make sure you have someone there to help you because you are basically not mobile for 20mins or you can do it when he or she is sleeping. but its up to you, also I like the swing because I pump at work and its small enough to fit in my purse<br>  good luck<br>  oh and the swing was only $180 and is a two phase pump which stimulates your breast like your baby would so it help keep your milk supply.|`|9KpidWBEaa	I have not used that particular madela pump but my madela that i own hurt so bad i stoped using it.  I got an avent pump and loved it.  It was gentel enough that i was not in pain but it got enough milk out that it kept me flowing when i went back to work.  Good luck on your serch for the right pump i would rent it first to see if it is for you if you like it you could always buy one later.|`|7W3iEtW8aa	It is great.  Is this your first kid?  I would rent if that is the case - see if you like it and use it.  easy to clean.
a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	How much was she at birth? My son was a 34 week preemie born at 4lbs 4oz and he is now 9 months and 16lbs. I dont know if she will start walking late. Lets hope she gets a little bigger before she walks, Id be afraid of people trampling my baby too!|`|YmEGCGtnaa	my niece is 10 mons and weighs 19 lbs and is 26 inches...shes actually the same as my 7-month-old daughter. being small and walking have nothing to do with each other. my 7-mon old is big and is still not crawling.|`|bHAlwhTBaa	My little guy is about 18.5 lbs and about 29 inches.  He is 10% in weight (approx) and 50% in height.  So he is long and lean!!   He stands too, when he has something to hold onto.  But I am pretty happy with his size.  We JUST moved him into the *big boy* car seat and what a pain it is!  I would have kept him in the carrier forever if I could have.  <br>  <br>  My nephew was a 2% baby, diagnosed with reflux and failure to thrive, and he walked before 11 months!!  He had to chase after his 4 year old So do NOT worry!  On the other hand, my friends 18 month old took her first steps last night, but she was a 3 lb preemie (by about 3 months).   I have never heard of a distinct correlation between size and walking...usually something else figures in.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	My friend nannies for a little boy who just turned two and his is just over 20 pounds, he has always been small (he has issues eating and sees a therapist for it) but all kids are different. He walked just fine around 15 months.|`|DLDweOcYaa	At 10 months my daughter was 21lbs 8oz.  She's almost 11 months old now.  She was born 3 weeks early weighing 6lbs 13oz.|`|Q3xUM68jaa	Everyone here has small babies. My girl was 8lbs 6ozs at birth and now at almost 5 months she is 15lbs and 26.5" long. Guess I have a little moo moo.|`|ddYu1rrYaa	My ten month old is 23 lbs and is about 29 inches. He is huge and just this week started to stand on his own. My 5 year old on the other hand has always been small as a baby in the 4oth percentile. he started walking at 9 months. i truly believe it just depends on the individual baby.|`|Apdwkw66aa	My daughter is almost 11 months and weighs 22 lbs. But...she is big for her age so don't worry. I don't think being little will influence her milestones at all. I think it would only be an issue if she was severely over weight.
c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	You need to figure out how much sleep your daughter needs.<br>  <br>  For example, if she has to be up by 7am, and if she would actually sleep until 9am if you left her, then she obviously needs 2 more hours of sleep.<br>  <br>  So, if she is going to bed at 10:00pm, then she needs to be in bed by 8:00pm.<br>  <br>  She will complain - ignore it and get her to bed on time!|`|Tc23KWgzaa	She won't get out of bed or can't get out of bed?  Is she solidly asleep?  What time does she go to bed?  Does she fall asleep quickly?  Is some amount of cafiene make it into her diet at all?<br>  <br>  We had trouble when my son was 8.  So we got his meds (including an ADD med) and made him take them at 7:30.  Then he could go back to sleep for 1/2 an hour.  Within half an hour, the meds had kicked in and he COULDN'T sleep.  There was another med that would make him sleepy.  So we gave that to him an hour before bedtime, and he would pass out.<br>  <br>  In Texas, as long as your child is there at the school at 10:15am, she is counted present.  The school gets paid for a student day if she's there at 10:15am, so if she doesn't actually make it to school until, say 8:30am...so what?  Look into the laws for your state.  If they are serious about making education fun and keeping kids from dropping out, this negative reinforcement in elementary school is the wrong way to start.<br>  <br>  TX Mom|`|0vLU2GGGaa	what do you mean she doesn't want to wake up??  So she doesn't want to wake up you just let her sleep in? OMG ... even 5 mins late is LATE, the school is not targeting you, you seriously need to correct this problem, get her to bed earlier, and wake her up when it is time, no excuse.  Sometimes my daughter doesn't want to get up in the morning too (i think no kids really like it), but i will just drag her *** up and took away her warm blanket.  DO SOMETHING, MOM!|`|5Nxb8aqRaa	we'll get her up earlier so there is no rush to get her to school so she isn't late and after a while of her not being late then maybe you can take her to a treat like a movie etc.|`|Y3EUTUwLaa	no big deal.  tell them no need stressing everyone out over something as trivial as that.|`|75acbeaefbdb50e3100c79930d1c607caa	first put her to sleep 1 hr early <br>  then get her up 1 hr early <br>  then no lateness n no drama from the school|`|56ko0AnOaa	maybe try to get her to bed earlier or start getting her up earlier so if it takes a while you're still on time. what grade is she in? i had this problem with my daughter in kinder but i told the school to eff off b/c kinder is NOT a required course in ca or nv - we live in ca. the law states a child must be enrolled in school @ age six but they can start in 1st grade. anyway - the school only cares because they get paid per student per day - if a childs is absent they dont get the money! tell them that on thursday & i bet they shut up!|`|OCKLSoKqaa	i agree witht he answers down below. wake her or start waking her atleast an hour earlier than when she needs to be out the door and in school! discuss with her that if she does not wake up in the morning when she is woken up there will be consequences (ie: earlier bedtime, no snack before bed, etc.)<br>  <br>  i hope this helps!<br>  good luck!|`|lVa2zYrlaa	I think if u are having a hard time waking her up, make her get up at least an hour before school starts. So no one has to rush or hurry. Maybe a little bit earlier. Only the parent are responsible for their kids being late NOT the school.|`|Or6RoRWDaa	Make her wake up at the appropriate time. You're not a bad mother but you need to be more rational.
oIBR7FUIaa	He was 12 days early. I went to a Valentine's Day party and my friends grandmother told me I was going to have my baby that night and that I should take her rocking chair home with me. I told her I wasn't due for 12 more days and she still said I was going to have him that night. I took the rocking chair home and sure enough 3 hours later I went into labor and had him the next morning.  The doctor said though, that if I could have done it natural instead of with the epideral, I would have still had a valentines baby.|`|YkzPfyp2aa	My first was 10 days late, had to be induced and my second was 7 days late, induced.<br>  My kids were way to comfortable.|`|r6IRYVRnaa	on it!! I was 40 weeks when i had her! September 30, 2008!!! I went into labor sept 29, 2008 at 12:28pm and had her 2:45 am september 30, 2008!!|`|GCPbKg9Eaa	before. But I developed preeclampsia and was induced at 37 weeks|`|vuEyUbsgaa	Mine was born about 3-4 weeks before his due date|`|FEg0PDdnaa	My son was born 7 days before his due date.|`|b7329aa7a50c45d2073625da82916595aa	Before, but I had a scheduled c-section.|`|uxmqgmCCaa	my daughter was born at 42 weeks.|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	7 days after and even then he took 18 hours and a ventouse delivery to be born. Kid was way to comfy in there!!|`|cj7sSPZEaa	My first was born right on her due date.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	both were born at exactly 38 weeks.  one induced one naturally|`|tWzdvnlwaa	Our first was born on the exact day; the second was over  2 weeks late.|`|AA10624857	My first baby was born 9 days past her due date.|`|qayCggxMaa	The day after my due date.
0iUxfCMcaa	they want you to have an iv just incase you need something like pain meds or fluids or even antibotics while your in labor. but you can refuse to have one. i hate needles alot too. what i do is i turn my head so i cant see them put it in then i cover it up with the blanket when they are done lol.|`|vuEyUbsgaa	lol the IV isnt bad at all! have you ever had your blood drawn during your pregnancy? its like that...you dont even feel the plastic tube going into your veins at all....I had more than a few IVs durng my pregnancy and its not bad at all!|`|jcXSNjowaa	No you only need a iv, if your getting medications for an infection or if you have the epidural|`|Coc593Ikaa	It is required if you get an epidural. If you go natural, you will not have to have an IV.|`|ZGXxP4vRaa	I've always had one.  Remember, the IV goes in with a needle, but the IV itself is a plastic tube.  It is actually a blessing to have one instead of having to take lots of meds orally and get extra shots.  Just take the IV and be happy.  In the long run it saves you more pokes.|`|MW1yrHbOaa	yes be prepared to have an IV and have more blood drawn|`|3qI1oyFaaa	How far along are you hun? I'm 27 weeks and have had to have my blood drawn about 10 times I'd guess throughout my pregnancy, which was a huge fear of mine. You get over things. And from what I hear about labor, I'm pretty sure a little IV in your arm will be the LAST of your worries when the time comes. <br>  <br>  RELAX a bit, and congrats on the pregnancy!!
532XA7lkaa	My son turned 4 this summer.  I bought some homeschooling books from Sam's Club...and they have them on Amazon too....I'm not planning on homeschooling him, but at least it's better than just senseless coloring....he can do the work sheets...trace letters...learn tall and short...full and empty...all kinds of things from the book.  Below is the one I bought:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Curriculum-Skills-Preschool-Curriculum%C3%A0/dp/1561893749/ref=pd_bbs_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235431705&sr=8-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Curr...</a><br>  <br>  Every page is brightly colored and thick so they don't rip....it has hundreds of pages and they are all perforated for easy tear out as well.  It's been a great tool for me at home with him.  Also, I know it's $13 there, but I bought the same book at Sam's for $7.87.|`|A8ofpjUiaa	Reading heaps of different books both fact & fiction.<br>  <br>  I also buy workbooks for my daughter so letter writing, mazes, dot to dots.<br>  <br>  I have been buying her these Usborne encyclopedias in areas that interest her, such as space. They are for older children but she loves learning and discovering new information. I read the actual information which increases her vocabulary and then we talk about what it means.<br>  <br>  I taught her phonics and now she's beginning to learn to read. I used starfall.com and then we often play eye spy in the car, where I would spy something beginning with the phonic sound 'b'.<br>  <br>  We also use paint and bath colors to let her find out how to make different colours.<br>  <br>  As she loves pretending it's her birthday everyday, we sing the months of the year and ask her to guess which month family & friends birthdays fall in. If she's not sure I'll describe the season etc giving her clues.<br>  <br>  I do believe beyond basics of counting and singing abcs it's important for your child to learn what interests them. We really don't have formal sit down, concentrate & learn session, rather it's usually gaming playing in whatever areas interest her.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	we do nature walks ..my kids could identify every tree and plant by age 3-5<br>  and tell you the medicinal application of the plant
5jqfKDdfaa	The easiest way for me to stop caring about one person is to find another person to like...<br>  <br>  Do you have a crush of some type ore even a guy you find very attractive? Focus on him instead.|`|ELSKfMpxaa	Just avoid him. <br>  Sorry I don't have a good answer for you. I've got a similar issue and haven't managed to work it out. My thoughts are if you can avoid the person long enough and distract your mind with other things enough eventually the feelings will fade.|`|oQDQSSSDaa	Yes, over time it will decrease. The less you see of him, the more you are likely to get over him. I'm sorry about the loss.|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	Well...I think that it's going to be really hard for you to "unlove" this guy, but if you really don't want to be in love...I would suggest staying away from him. But like I just said, it's going to be really difficult if you really are in love with him.<br>  <br>  But you also mentioned that you are still grieving (I'm very sorry to hear about that), perhaps you're not really thinking clearly yet? I am grieving too and it's really difficult to try and think clearly while your emotions are running wild.
ilMi2HSeaa	how strange, I'm in exactly the same boat as you -- same days and same symptoms. however, i did take a pregnancy test at 3am thursday because i was getting antsy and couldn't sleep. it came up negative, but it may have been too early to test. I'm going to give it a few more days and if nothing else happens, I'm going to test again.<br>  <br>  i would recommend grabbing a hpt, or going to your dr. it could be pregnancy but it could also be something else that could warrant seeing a dr. or it could simply be an irregular period.<br>  <br>  ps. did you have cramps at all? i didn't and that's highly unusual.|`|uxmqgmCCaa	do a test thats the only thing i can suggest.Do you have any other symptoms.

sRy2SKpXaa	I can honestly say I do not remember the day/night before I went into labor. But, the day that I DID go into labor I do remember well. I woke up, got my usual pregnancy craving of a Whopper (big big mistake) because I did not think or feel like it was "time". However, a short amount of time later, I started having mild period cramps. An hour or so later I realized they were contractions and went to the hospital. I spent a few hours throwing up/hooked up to machines to be sent home with "false labor". To make a long story short, at 1050 the same night Anthony David was born, which proved my point that it was indeed REAL labor, not false. I'm pregnant with my second, almost 31 weeks so i've got time before he makes his appearance. I'm just afraid that it'll be me and my 3 year old in the delivery room, because my husband is being deployed in a week and a half, and my mother isn't coming down until 10 days before i'm due. So god willing, this little boy will stay put until then. Good luck!|`|sVPToYvKaa	The night before my nephew Jason Michael was born, my sister and I were reading "myths" about how to induce labor. (otherwise, force the baby out because she was in pain!) <br>  <br>  We jogged, drank hot tea, etc. <br>  <br>  Finally, at like 2 a.m. we gave up and were playing yahtzee..<br>  at about 3:30 she just screamed and a was like "yahtzee?" & she said NO! I think I just felt a contraction! It's time!<br>  <br>  I guess those myths might actually work!|`|YVBXMghXaa	I was actually working at Outback when I went into labor :)
65RZ441Zaa	lol honestly it's like a HUGE flem ball. i don't think it's always bloody. but You'll just know when it does come out. Most people i know called their doctor to see if it was suppose to be so big!! (lol so gross i know.). Some women won't loose theirs at all!<br>  <br>  google it lol|`|AA11682796	I've been having really thick (creamy white) discharge as well, as far as I am aware that is not the mucus plug...However my doctor said that more mucus is good, it keep your vaginal canal nice a moist so it's easier to deliver baby.|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	yea it is mucus mine didnt have blood in it|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	Im sorry im no help i just wanted to say.... that's sooo gross. :)|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Sometimes it has blood in it, but usually the bloody show arrives later in labor.  For me it looked like a horse booger with one end being crusty/dry and the end I assume was attached to me looking like boogers, and it came out all at once - a wine cork sized mucus plug.|`|ChsvVm60aa	my first pregnancy i had a little at a time ,, i had braxton hicks false labour...they kept asking if i had lost the plug ..Lol i didnt really know what they were talking about...but  then i did notice a fair size with no blood... then a week later i went into labour....<br>  secongd baby i dont even recall it happened so fast.. hope i helped everyone can be different... gl :)
d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	I had my period 3 months after having baby-breast fed til she was 19months old (til i had her brother) exactly 19months apart|`|GlzVQclpaa	It took me almost 4 years with my first. With the second one I got pregnant almost immediately after I had my mirena removed. I had it removed September 4th and had a positive pregnancy test on Oct. 13th so it happened really fast!|`|CPwdVc4caa	4 months, after losing our first at 19 weeks.|`|Ar6wD9Oeaa	6 months after we decided to start trying.<br>  We have been TTC #3 for 4 months now..... still no BFP!|`|28QPS6V9aa	Ha ha ha, well I might not be the best person to ask because I got pregnant only seven weeks after having my daughter thinking my birth control was effective when it wasn't. So it didn't take long. First time we had sex after having her I got pregnant. But I never had a period during those seven weeks and I was breastfeeding and somehow I still managed to ovulate. So just because you haven't had your period yet, doesn't mean you aren't ovulating. Chances are, you can get pregnant any time now.  Good luck!|`|4p9sBdyTaa	It took years, I am 24 weeks with #2 and my son is 7 years old but I have fertility issues.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Let's see it took a day after a heated argument. A la boom, make up "loving" = conception that took place.<br>  <br>  Seriously my husband and I weren't actively trying for another one but with our daughter it took about a year before I became pregnant.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Three years.  About same as first time.
CL4p7fccaa	Its totally normal - my daughter was born with a head of hair that rubbed off underneath at the back only - she looked like a little monk !<br>  <br>  It will grow back - go with more tummy time during the day & you could try a silk pillowslip under babys head when they sleep. (SECURE IT TIGHTLY TO THE MATTRESS OR BOTTOM SHEET so it doesnt move around babys face).<br>  <br>  The silk is less 'grippy' than cotton or flannel and will stop a little of the rubbing.<br>  <br>  Also works well for girls with long fine hair who wake up with a head full of knots in their hair - a normal pillow and silk pillowcase from about 3 year old up is fine.|`|XVljoYZ5aa	I know its hard, but wait it out. She will grow thick, beautiful hair there someday, but she is a baldie for now. I was the same way, and my mother always had me in old fashioned bonnets.|`|AA11612508	it will happen. nothing you can do will help it either. it happens!|`|9QVjNaIPaa	more tummy time|`|AA10938311	It is normal. All of my sisters children (two girls and one boy) all had the same bald spot on the back of their cute lil heads.  <br>  <br>  It will grow back in.  Don't worry. <br>  <br>  In the mean while a sleep positioner may help.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Totally normal, try to do more tummy time.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	personaly i would just leave her be its completely normal and will grow back. my daughter went tatally bald at the back and now at 14 months has a gorgeous head of hair:)
nfzQkvqraa	I get that it's an all star team.  I get that they want to win.  Maybe they think the pants will get in the way or are unsafe. Maybe they think that despite the temperature she will overheat in a hoodie.  It's still unacceptable to scream at your daughter in that way.  After all you're the one that sent her dressed like that.  And you were right to do so.  I'm not trying to defend them.  Just trying to rationalize why they would be so anal as to react that way.  They are 10 years old.  I would throw a fit if my child got suspended for that reason. Hitting, poor conduct.  Fine.  Dressing for the weather.  Not ok to be suspended.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry for your daughter.  It seems extremely unfair.|`|PJBjllsVaa	absolutely not what kind of dress code won't let you wear warm clothes when it's cold outside? that's the dumbest thing i ever heard not to mention being suspended for it? why couldn't they just ask her to change? and furthermore i that coach yelled at my kid like that i would make sure he didn't forget who the parent was (meaning i would have flipped on him) i think you should see about getting that coach removed..it's one thing to follow rules it's another thing to flip out on a kid for no reason.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	You put her in that league. You have to follow the rules.
AA11476951	Oh it's horrible and just think these whiners are having babies! It's going to get worse!|`|a6e7SRYzaa	Well let me say this I agree with you 100% and I am in the generation. I am 21 and have been married for a year and I have a college degree. I am a grown woman who can take care of myself. I have a friend that is a year older than me still lives at home and is upset that her parents wont buy her a new car even though they bought her last one. I am embarrassed to be in this generation. Just try not to clump all of us in that category. I have worked hard for where I'm at in my life and I'm very proud of myself.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	just that in your culture people move out of the house and leave the parents by 18 doesn't mean it is acceptable to every other culture, or countries.  In Asia, a lot of people live with their parents even after they have their own family and take care and listen to what their parents well into their adulthood.  They are not whiners, just different culture.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Yes there is a generation of whiners. America has lived beyond their means for so long, but the baby boomers really spoiled their children, and now they've produced these whiny kids that want the latest iPhone, clothes, cars, etc. I think it's more preteens and teenagers than anything. It's sick.|`|ajEuk4MTaa	The generation ahead of you no doubt feels the same way about you. I'm 27, and the 15-18 year olds are so damned petty and focused on image that it blows my mind. Not to mention the drama...<br>  <br>  It's evolution.. Get used to it.|`|frpCK0utaa	most twenty year olds i know have moved out and started college. But then, i usually skip those questions, as they annoy me.<br>  <br>  I suggest you do the same.|`|sbeoF50gaa	LMAO I totally agree. BUNCHA wussies. I've seen what ur talkin about and I"m like "wtf how old are you again?"|`|rqOIqO7Raa	Did someone pee in your cherrios this morning?? Which question set you off?!?|`|VKQzj4Pmaa	It's our society. Everyone wants everything they want, but won't do what it takes to get it.<br>  <br>  People also like to be catered to and pampered. If life isn't going their way, it's unfair. If their parents go against their desires, they are a victim. Though they claim to be an adult, they don't want to leave mommy and daddy to be the tough, independent adult they complain to be.<br>  <br>  The way children turn out is do to the parenting they received. Period.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying all 20 year olds are like this. But you do see it a lot.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I think i has to do with the parents. I have a "friend" who complains all the time and it drives me crazy. She wines about how much college is costing her ( she didnt have to go that school) about how her dinner didnt turn out right so on and so forth. Another one is a year older then me, sadly has a child and complains that her daughter is a normal 2 year old and sometimes does naughty things. On the other hand I know two guys who are room mates, work there butts off, one goes to college and ive never heard them complain come to think of it. Im 21, married, have a 2 year old and one on the way and im so lucky that i have the wonderful life that I do. I get to be a stay a home mommy for my little one, my husband works hard and I have nothing to complain about pretend or not.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I've yet to see a 20 year old whine about what they can and can't do.  A 20 year old is a legal adult.<br>  <br>  What I think is that there is a generation of ignorant, close minded parent like you out there that are infesting society today.|`|FvhCUHjxaa	Yeah; sorry I'm in that age group and I don't whine about rules; because I'm in college and have my own rules! I don't need my parents to tell me what to do anymore and they actually respect me as an adult; maybe you should re phrase your question because the only whiners are 17 and under.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	I know, I saw the question that sparked this too. I had my first kid at 20 (just before my 21st birthday but still), I had been out of my parents house, going to school and working full time for years. I ended up being a single mom for awhile but still I bought my first home when I was 25 and now i have a great partner and a new baby girl. I'm almost 27 yrs old but I know quite a few 30 yr olds that are still hanging out in mom and dad's basement smoking pot and it seems to be getting worse.|`|iTEf1dP3aa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmgaXoCEYd3AxROYF_5bV6587hR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090223151529AAfsrFx">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  I think that was the question that set you off....like one of the other commentors said, culture has a lot to do with it to, this person in particular is Asian.....on the other hand, what sets me off is when grown a$s people think they are the best in parenting and call other parents on it, by calling them losers because they are single....ugh!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Since when is there 20 year old's complaining about mom's rules.

It's not totally too late. Start calling the police on them and tell them that they're going to be the state's problem if they won't cooperate. I don't know about you, but I refuse to let my kids run me over and cause me stress. You gotta put fear in their hearts while they're growing up...stand up for your self...they need you, not the other way around. Send them to boot camp...lol...make 'em get some act right!!! So, maybe you don't want to take any of my advice...but you need to stand up for yourself, if nothing else. Don't fight them...don't argue with them...don't reward them with iPods or digital cameras & allowance when they run away or are acting horrible...GIVE THEM NOTHING!!! Make them earn what they get.

VQs0adT8aa	I agree generally with the first poster, just want to add a little more detail.  The book she mentioned is GREAT.  Link below to order yourself a copy (check out the used sellers to get a good deal).<br>  <br>  Really depends on what kind of fertility monitor you are using.  Most fertility predictor kits or monitors are watching for a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) which will provide the impetus needed to pop that egg!  The LH surge can happen, as she said above, about 12-36 hours before you actually ovulate.<br>  <br>  Possible timeline:  It could be perfectly plausible for your body to begin the LH surge, THEN produce egg-white-quality fluids, THEN release the egg as a result of the LH surge finally, THEN dry up post-ovulation.<br>  <br>  You should always treat the egg-white fluid as fertile, though.  Always.  Especially if you're not charting.  So go ahead and BD when your monitor says to AND anytime you have egg-white fluids.  Unless you're dealing with low sperm count.  In that case, I would go for the very first egg-white fluids you see, assuming that it happens at least within 12 hours of the positive OPK.<br>  <br>  You can check CM when wiping, by checking your undies, or with a clean finger internally.  It really doesn't matter as long as you're consistent.|`|NaJPIOheaa	Hey dear.. well i'm guessing it is because when the OPK tells you that you are fertile, it means that you will be ovulating within the next 12-36 hours, but also does vary from every gal. I'm reading the book "taking charge of your fertility" by tori weshler, and i'm learning new things every page, and i thought i knew alot!! Just to be careful i'd BD on the days your OPK monitor tells you your fertile, and when your experiencing the EWCM, but not every day, every other day so the sperm can accumulate and mature! If you check inside you make sure to wash your hands before hand, if your checking your cervical position, you can also check for mucous, but usually you can check mucous by wiping, or on your underwear.. Good luck dear & tons of baby dust xo|`|fYMWDQLGaa	Hi I think I am in the situation as you are now.<br>  <br>  its 6 dpos as of today, and today morning i see a white discharge, its not stretchy its like nose*** , dont know wats happening. had my breast nipples as sensitive as ever, i havent felt that before in my lifetime, mild cramping in the uterus and right ovary.. ughhh.. being on TTC is really a waiting game. <br>  <br>  goodluck and loads of baby dust dear...|`|O8eBCmTXaa	yes you are suppose to have egg white discharge when you are ovulating. it happens because your vagina is acidic and it helps to make it less acidic so the sperm can live in that environment. and when checking it you can just look at it when you go to the bathroom.<br>  hope this helps :)
deIzFnV8aa	Our DD has only gained about a lb a month tops so far - 16 oz in a lb, so that is a little less than 1/2 oz a day.  And no one has questioned her wt gain at all as being inadequate. Its true she was not a preemie and therefore no one was worried about her to begin with.  I would insist on doing both at the minimum; baby will get the nutritional value from your milk and you will be able to bond moer with her, even if you are only about to BF at half the feeds.|`|uCLenopbaa	i've heard that hind milk, has more calories in it. so maybe you can pump for a few mins, then breastfeed her. use both breasts if she is still hungry.|`|ZKxgqK3zaa	ok don't feel bad! Relax!<br>  <br>  it may take some time for your body to adjust BUT never doubt your milk supply! You produce what your baby needs! You can give her formula but I would do it every other feeding. Just to help with the weight gain. In one feeding use both breasts. Nurse one side, burp, and then nurse the other. Then in the next feeding try the formula. flip flop it. If you only use one breast at a time per feeding the baby may develop a favorite and choose one over the other and that may have some supply issues! I encourage pumping because it helps with production too. So when you do the round of bottle feeding pump what you can from your breasts and store it for a later day! It takes patients but with determination and persistence you should be fine! I did this with my daughter because she was born with jaundice and they needed her to get it out so I talked with a nurse and this is what she told me to do.<br>  <br>  Good luck and stay positive!|`|uMIvRRjoaa	Well for FT infants the expected weight gain is an avg of 6 oz per wk. <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/enough-milk.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/enough...</a><br>  IS BABY GETTING ENOUGH? -- QUICK REFERENCE CARD <br>  ~~~ BIRTH to 6 WEEKS ~~~ <br>  WEIGHT GAIN:<br>  If baby is gaining well on mom’s milk alone, then baby is getting enough. A 5-7% weight loss during the first 3-4 days after birth is normal. Baby should regain birth weight by 2 weeks. Once mom’s milk comes in, average weight gain is 6 oz/week. If these goals are not met, call your lactation consultant. More on weight gain. <br>  WET DIAPERS: 5 - 6+ sopping wet diapers per day (after 1st week).<br>  Expect one wet diaper on day one, increasing to 5-6 by one week. To feel what a sufficiently wet diaper is like, pour 3 tablespoons (45 mL) of water into a clean diaper (if baby wets more often, then the amount of urine per diaper may be less). Urine should be pale and mild smelling. <br>  DIRTY DIAPERS: 3 – 4+ dirty diapers per day (after day 4).<br>  Stools should be yellow (no meconium) by day 5 and the size of a US quarter (2.5 cm) or larger. The normal stool of a breastfed baby is usually yellow and is loose (soft to watery, may be seedy or curdy). More on infant stooling. <br>  OTHER POSITIVE SIGNS: After a feeding, mom’s breast feels softer and baby seems reasonably content. Baby is alert, active and meeting developmental milestones. <br>  <br>  Now, just because you need to supplement does not mean you can't bf as well. I'd talk to your doc and an IBCLC about using a SNS while you're nursing to allow your LO to get the high calorie formula and bf and keep your supply up at the same time. <br>  <br>  Here's some more resources on bfing your preemie<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/preemie/preemie-links.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/preemie/preem...</a><br>  <br>  GL!!|`|ubo0HWtVaa	you can still do both, why is that you can't do both? insist on doing both if this is what you want!|`|UghJ0XROaa	From what i have heard, as long as she is gaining weight at all, she is getting enough, the only issue comes if she is losing weight and you said yourself that she is gaining, even though it is only a little bit.

SnQvsOPwaa	Its normal. Instead of asking her if she needs to go. tell her to go. Have her go before you go anywhere and when you get back. This is very common with kids no need to get mad about it.|`|uP08b6K4aa	It might a good idea to take her to your GP and have him check  that she hasn't got a urinary infection or some other underlying problem that may be causing her to unnecessarily wet herself.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes children are far too preoccupied (and sometimes downright lazy!) to realise they need to go to the toilet so badly and unfortunately some leaks out, at which point it can be too late!.  Try not to raise your voice or get angry as there could well be another issue causing her to wet at the moment.  If she fears that she'll get told off for making a little mistake, it could lead her to fear going to the toilet altogether or telling you in the future if she does it.<br>  <br>  Also ask your GP (if he rules out any infection or otherwise) if he could perhaps put you in touch with your Health Visitor who may be able to give you some pointers towards putting an end to what might be just a phase.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|9e69YDivaa	consider pull ups or the kinds of diapers that look just like underwear until you think she's ready.<br>  if not, i've watched "daddy day camp" and it was said to sleep in the clothes you wore that day so you won't wet yourself :D<br>  <br>  good luck to you and her!

b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	it's hard.. you and your baby have been together for 9 months and leaving a baby at home is tough.. very tough.. well, you have to bite the bullet and move on.. one tip from a mom who had to leave a baby at the daycare (3-mo old baby) and was crying all the way to the work - don't bring any baby pictures as they would distract you and make it unnecessarily harder on you.. but you are not going to have fun - you are providing for the family, so you have to do it.. and this is how you should treat the situation..|`|7vRVF6wUaa	You do what you have to do to support your children.  Nobody wants to go to work and leave their kids, but in order to support them you have no choice.  It will get easier.  Make sure you have good daycare, it will help you worry less.

Hang in there!|`|5ZwIASCgaa	i went back to work when my son was 2 months turning 3 it was so hard i think every mother faces this problem its so sad...now he is 11 months old and its worse because when i walk out the door he crys and i can hear him crying as i go down the stairs even if he is wit my bf (his dad) the only person he doesnt do that for is my grandmother he loves her...but it kills me to hear or see him do that...the best advice i can give is do what ur heart tells u!
BbwI6CJqaa	hi, when your dr confirms your pregnant, you get a blood test, your weight will be recorded, then you will be asked if you want share care between your gp and the hospital.  when they do the blood test they have an idea how far you are but your last period date will be used to determine your due date.|`|WecTdlZ5aa	I found out when I was about 6 weeks & they brought me in when I was 8 weeks.<br>  <br>  At mine - they make you give a urine sample (which they also do at the beginning of EVERY visit), they felt around my vagina to make sure everything felt okay, checked my boobs, and also did a vaginal ultrasound.<br>  <br>  I think that was about it!|`|sIr2fWh6aa	Every office is different on when they would like to see you for the first time.. Generally, it's between 6-8 weeks pregnant so they can do labs (HCG levels, STD tests, etc.), get your height, weight, blood pressure, and then they'll see you more frequently as your pregnancy progresses.
HFKVREiUaa	how can an abortion fail? dont a dr. know if just killed a fetus or are  they stupid and blind? im against it, ifmy mother tryed to abort meand i survived, i would hate her. my brain would probley been messed up more than my arms or legs. but seriously just look it  up online and you will find better answers.sorry.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i have heard the babies have chopped off limbs  ahh sick and sad
01ntBgaPaa	It is possible but HIGHLY unlikely. 98-99% of all women have Hcg so if you happen to be that 1-2% the doctors tend to keep a closer eye on you. <br>  <br>  I am 20 weeks pregnant with baby #1 and have no Hcg. I have all the other hormones and go in to see my doctor alot. The first few months I was super stressed because my doctor had yet to see a successful pregnancy without the hormone. All the other patients mis-carried. Now he is excited and my level is 14.<br>  <br>  In terms of not having any of the hormones, you would miscarry pretty fast. You need most of the hormones so the baby can grow and develope. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|7KMOLdcNaa	HCG is the pregnancy hormone.  Hcg doubles every day and is high very early in the pregnancy.  If HCG is negative or doesnt rise drastically then chances are the pregnancy isnt a viable pregnancy.  Also if the HCG is high and there is nothing visible by ultrasound, the pregnancy mey be in the tube.
YFPMcHCbaa	Probably not. Ask your doctor for more information on the after-effects of placental abruption and blood infection.

tcHkn0VIaa	Braxton Hicks are the type of contractions you are having that are never regular and they are just practice. Usually they will keep you if it looks as if your labor is progressing- continuous contractions that are steady, close together, and producing results. If you go in and are 3 cm but you are not having regular contractions it could still be a long time and they may not keep you it just depends. I would rather not be in the hospital until i have to be though :)|`|DVmDWDC4aa	I had irregular contractions for 4 days. I went to hospital repeatedly and was sent home. Finally, I was 2cm dilated but they kept me in because I wasn't progressing. They gave me something to make me sleep and relax, and in an hour I went from 2cm to 9.5cm!<br>  <br>  Try to rest as much as possible, as hard as it is, and stay relaxed because this will really speed it up. Take baths, just warm, with lavender oil in.|`|0iUxfCMcaa	with my 3rd child i was 3cm for about 2-3wks before they finally let me have him lol i was 4cm and having very strong contractions when they decided to keep me at the hospital.<br>  my water never broke till he was coming out.|`|r6IRYVRnaa	I was 2 cm n having contraction like 5 mins apart n they were lasting 90 secs!! I went quick when they started the pit!! well good luck|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Most hospitals use 4 cms as being the dilation of admittance, but it depends on your situation, it's very rare to be 4cm and no in labor.  Such as if you have pre-eclampsia or premature rupture of the membranes or fetal distress they are going to keep you no matter what your cervix is doing.<br>  <br>  Yes it's possible to have irregular contractions and be labor but it doesn't count as true labor until you hit 4cm, and by then they are pretty regular.   As for being dilated to 3cm and then being induced - theoretically if the fetus is happy and there is plenty of amniotic fluid nothing should be done before 42 weeks.|`|0BC2WTyoaa	I was 4 cm at my 37 week appointment and my Dr waited until 38 weeks to induce me, and it was due to my blood pressure not how dilated I was.  I remember being so paranoid that I would miss my epidural and not feel my contractions until it was time to push (that happened with my first baby).  I think this is why my blood pressure was up.
CPwdVc4caa	My OB just said to wait until I had seen him and made sure everything had healed the way it should...two weeks all said and done.|`|UaL28atDaa	Take a look at this video it will explain everything you need to know.

bql2RJzWaa	About the GD test, you will have to drink this certain drink. Just guzzle it- get it over with, lol. Then you will have to wait 60 minutes with out eating, drinking or going to the washroom. Then, they will take about 4 viles of blood. Then you done. You will probably learn your results within 2 weeks.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	When i was about 30 weeks I was measured at 32, and I'm on track now, babies grow at different rates.  Sounds healthy.  You should look up the meds that your doc gave you.  I'm sure if they said its safe then its okay to take, a few weeks ago though they gave me these pills cause i couldn't sleep and i ended up just dealing with it and not takin them because of what it said on the internet and the paper work that they gave me with it.  (it said not to use while breastfeeding) and so i got scared to even take it while prego.  When i had my gest diab. test they had me drink this soda pop drink in 10 mins or less and then wait an hour and then draw blood....so it will take a lil over an hour. :)  They will call you if you have gest diab. but no news is good news and they told me at my next appointment that i DIDN'T have it.|`|QIUCmRFoaa	I can answer the Gestational Diabetes test question.  I'm overweight, so they made me take one pretty early.  You will be there for approximately an hour.  They are going to make you drink a very sugary liquid as quickly as possible (I think they want it gone w/in 5 minutes) and then they make you sit around and wait for an hour.  When the hour is up, they are going to take some blood from you.  I don't know about anyone else, but I never heard any results from mine, because I didn't have any problems...
F1DXUByNaa	i've heard that the cheap ones are more reliable~|`|kaqPSgTVaa	They are all just as accurate and FDA approved. The ONLY differences between tests are the amount of hormone they detect and packaging.<br>  <br>  I took a Dollar Store test 4 days before my period was due and got a positive. Price does not matter.|`|W1p6LetFaa	I spent $13 on three tests at Walmart. They were all accurate.  I personally would be skeptical of the dollar store ones, but please don't spend a ton.  The cheap ones work just as well!|`|Coc593Ikaa	In my experience the cheap ones work just as well.<br>  <br>  If you look at the tests, you will see that a lot of the money goes into the packaging and the outer shell of the test. Cheaper tests are smaller, while more expensive tests are larger with more plastic, but inside they both contain the same kind of strip.|`|A6S5Tx2Oaa	No, price does not matter.  After taking several to confirm 4 different pregnancies I am sure that price does not matter.|`|sdtqTbmoaa	price doesnt matter..but for me..digital preg test are the easiest...less trying figure out the lines. there a bit more expensive then regular  but just so much easier. and on those it dont matter what brand..there good.
sIr2fWh6aa	I had the shot 2 weeks ago.. It's not necessarily supposed to stop you from progressing, but it may slow it down just a bit.  The med is actually to progress the baby quicker, so that if you have a preterm delivery, the baby will be healthy enough.|`|hsp7f9Epaa	yes with my recent daughter I just had her in jan09 and my son was <br>  6wks early so they gave me the shot at 28wks|`|GEfpzUNvaa	sorry havent heard of that before....|`|J2glFOkhaa	I had my first child at 30 weeks, I'm 11 weeks along now, and they are takling about possibly giving me the shots. I am 100% against it, only because they haven't really explained the need or any risks involved.|`|p3d3E75oaa	lol Im 34 weeks and had the same shots and no it doesn't stop you from dilating Your baby just might have gotten comfortable

HvoOeTVuaa	For brand new babies, I loved using Pampers Swaddlers.  They are soft and VERY absorbent.<br>  <br>  When you little one get a little older, don't be afraid to experiment with store brand diapers.  I use HEB (grocery store) brand diapers exclusively and I can honestly say that I love them more than any other name brand diaper.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	Bum Genius 3.0 and Fuzzi Bunz are two amazing brands.  You don't get the papery feeling like with a lot of diapers, they're super absorbent and can become more absorbent if you want, they don't have any harsh chemicals, and they're made from extremely high quality materials.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Huggies diapers are AWESOME! I reccomend the wipes too, nice and durable so you don't get poop on your hand when wiping little butts. LOL.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Pampers for premature babies, but after they are to regular size Kirkland diapers, no question!|`|AA11612508	best quality and i swear by them is huggies.<br>  <br>  I have two children, and the whole time they were in diapers, i only tried crappy brand diapers once, and i never finished the pack. Yes they are cheaper, but you will change baby more and they leak like crazy, so you use double the diapers. But huggies in bulk at walmart target kmart etc, and they arent that expensive. literally 4 dollar more then the cheapest brand.|`|Yyqhbyoiaa	HUGGIES hun, they used them for my son in hospital and he was 5 weeks early. I still use them to this day as I find they don't leak and soft on bum.<br>  Edit: Huggies may costmore but are the best and can get sizes 0-4kg. <br>  I saw on tv the other da huggies nappies priced at $38 for 180 nappies for boys. Just look around you can get them cheap.|`|sbeoF50gaa	I LOVE pampers! Luvs always leaked with me, Huggies ALWAYS left this.. goo on my babies butt! It was gross AND they leaks. I hated huggies! I never had a problem with Pampers! It was the only brand I bought. OH someone said something about the smell with huggies! so true!|`|4kfljeIGaa	I like Huggies.

I started to use Huggies on my newborn but they smelled like pee. Plus they felt a Little rough. It depends on what size you need, but I used pampers saddlers until she was in size three cruisers.

Huggies wipes are too wet. Good Luck!|`|qWNVHEsJaa	I loved pampers!  We tried Luvs and they leaked horribly.. and huggies were ok, but we felt the pampers were a better fit for our daughter.|`|a508777527beb8fd9a3a41166b16dccdaa	pamper swaddlers are the best, I think they have preemie size, they are soft and very absorbent!|`|5baec14131fd7b822f3da2903a188129aa	I found Pampers swaddlers and baby dry worked great during the day... but huggies absorbed more for overnight.|`|5ZwIASCgaa	LUVS there my favorite!!!!!!!|`|joiacDUdaa	I have two toddlers and when they were tiny babies I used pampers swaddlers.. They have them for premies.. However, as my children got bigger I "tested" several other brands of diapers as well.  I absolutely HATED the Walmart brand "white cloud"  terrible leaky things.  I LOVE and still use Bj's (BERKELEY & JENSEN) brand diapers they have a money-back guarantee.... Which I've used ONCE I just upgraded the size... I used to like LUVS but, they changed the past time I used them I had coupons so it was cheaper than any other brand by like $5.. They were horrible.. I ended up calling the customer service line and they sent me $30 worth of coupons... I used them and bought the next size up and they were still terrible so I followed the instructions to get my money-back and got my money refunded promptly.. So, I DID get two months ($60) worth of diapers FREE!  You may have to have some trial and error for your personal preferances... I've also used HUGGIES with terrible results.  They leaked and leaked everytime... Eventually, I got my money-back from them as well.... If money were no option I would probably opt for PAMPERS but, they are expensive even if you have coupons.... I buy in bulk and for PAMPERS it's about $35-$40 for a case... When I can buy Bj's brand for about 1/2 the cost... <br>  <br>  good luck|`|CVdcrY3kaa	Pampers have always worked best for my daughter. I'm not sure when it comes to being a premature baby, but if your child grows to have really chunky thighs - pampers were the only ones that didn't leak (or squeeze too tight on her thighs)
KYMDPdA8aa	You usually don't have any symptoms until you are about five weeks pregnant. But if you have already missed your period you can take a test now. For an accurate result you can always go to plan parenthood, they can either do a blood test or a urine test.   I took two pregnancy tests at home and they were both  inaccurate so I went to plan parenthood. With you spotting you could be starting your period, since you have taken plan b it does mess up you cycles. BUT you could still be prego even if you are spotting.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Its possible!  Anytime you have sex you can get pregnant, the spotting could have been from the pill you took, or implantation spotting.  That can occur anywhere from 6-12 days after ovulation (day of conception).  Take a test when your period is due, good luck.|`|c0plf0VLaa	I don't mean to sound judgmental or harsh, but you really should practice safe sex.. You don't exactly sound like someone who is ready for kids.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	We can't really tell you. Spotting can be from a lot of things. Just wait a few more days and take a test.|`|AA11795652	Take a test and start using regular birth control or stop having sex if you can't be responsible.
ftSsVFQNaa	Honesty is always the best policy. You should tell him now I mean it should just be something he always knows. I mean he is a baby you don't need to sit him down and have a talk. LOL!!!!! If I were you I would get a very good book about adoption made for children. They have tons of them. Just begin reading it to him just like you read other books to him. Then when he is about two tell him you are adopted like the baby in the book. Now I am your mommy and I love you very much. I would say that every once in a while. Then after about age 3 or 4 I wouldn't say it anymore. He will then know he is adopted and will ask you and your mom questions as he is ready to know them. Just make sure to always give him hugs and kisses and make sure he knows that ya'll love him. If he ever needs to ask a question be honest. If he is two young and the truth is not so good. For instance if he was adopted from foster care. Make sure to tell it in a way that is age appropriate. As he gets older and older you can give more information as he wants to know. Some don't want to know so if he doesn't talk about it don't push it. If the first mom loved him make sure he knows that. If he decides he wants to meet her then support him and help him find her. Just make sure he knows you love him. He will love you more for the honesty and support. If you hide and lay it all on him later it is like a bomb. There will be hard feelings. If you are honest all along he will love you more. Your mom doesn't have to worry as long as she loves and is good and honest to him. He will love her for that. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Love,<br>  michelle|`|24012ce93a61f006e2d2c809881dd85aaa	Yes, absolutely he should be told!! Your mom IS his "real" mom, as she is the one who is raising him. He would be more likely to be resentful and love her less if he finds out that she has been essentially lying to him his whole life one day. He deserves, as a human being, to know that his birth mother gave him up, and that your mom lovingly and willfully adopted him and loves him. To keep that information from him is living a lie, and grossly unfair to the child. Your mom can explain to him about "accidental" kids and "on purpose" kids. His birth mom had an accident, and got a baby she did not want or could not keep for herself. Your mom Wanted baby so much, she got him on purpose, and that makes her his REAL mom. A real mom is the one who loves and raises you, not necessarily the woman who was biologically stuck with you.|`|sbnlqrsoaa	It is wayyyy better to tell him now, sit him down and explain to him what it is. It will be a huge mistake if you don't!|`|2Hot9EJiaa	PLEASE have your mother tell her son that he is adopted as soon as possible. You can begin using the word in the house so that he will get used to hearing it. For your first answerer that said wait until he is 14, has no clue on what that may do to your little brother.  Put yourself in his shoes for just a moment.  You are adopted and your mother decides not tell you-  about the age of 10 you overhear someone tell someone else that you are adopted, how would that make you feel?  Also if she told you at 14- wouldn't that make you feel she had something to hide all those years.  The longer she waits to tell him, the harder it will be for him to understand.  I am adopted and was told at such an early age, that I cannot even remember. I also have 2 adopted children, and they knew very early as well. About not loving your mother, because she is his REAL mom- you are wrong- she is his real mom.  She is the one that is raising him.  This is not to say to birth moms are not moms too, so please don't give me thumbs down, because I said that adoptive parents are real.  Have your mom tell him when he is almost too young to understand, and then he will grow up with the thought that adoption is a good thing. I always did.|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	Yes your mother should tell him in fact seeing that he will be 2 years old this year I think she should get some adoption story books for his age and read those to him he wouldn’t fully understand but it will get it out there. There are ton just have her do a search on amazon for adoption. I was official adopted when I was 3 years old but was with my family at 3 weeks old(foster baby)  I never remember not knowing I was adopted.   Very few adoptees don’t love their adoptive parents. Your mother is the one who is raising your brother, she is the one who is there for him and will continue to be there for him through out his life in every way that a mother should be for their child so she is his real mother in every sense except genetically. <br>  <br>  A book your mom might get is Talking with Young Children about Adoption|`|zLoyo24Taa	You need to tell him. Start talking about it and he will ask questions as he needs to. Be open and honest, it is not child abuse if you don't tell him, but he will have a difficult time when he realizes he has been lied to.|`|JaTjoLNlaa	tell him. you have too. and he'll still love you guys as long as you raise him. he'll completely hate you if he finds out when its too late. and he'll most likely find out.<br>  so yeah, tell, its essential to him.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	From day 1. Be honest as long as he can talk, if it is kept from him surely it can only hurt him in the long run. Tell it him as if it were a fairy story.|`|27fcbd4a2b0b4c5a2c64b68f6be0547faa	Lies ALWAYS have a way of coming out.<br>  NEVER lie to adoptees.<br>  Please.<br>  All adoptees deserve their truth.<br>  <br>  If this child doesn't love you mother 'enough' - that's your mother's issues that she needs to deal with.<br>  This child didn't ask to be taken from one family and placed in another.<br>  Those were adult decisions.<br>  <br>  For the record - most adoptees I know - love their adoptive family very very much.<br>  BUT - they get very very cranky if they're lied to - and sometimes it can ruin relationships forever.<br>  Make sure you read the stories at this website - by adoptees that found out years and years down the track - quite heart-breaking - <br>  <a href="http://www.latediscovery.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.latediscovery.org/</a><br>  <br>  Adoptees come from another family - and they need to know their truth.<br>  It's very hard to not know who you look and act like.<br>  I'm and aodptee - and I have 2 mothers - that's my reality.<br>  Your mother needs to get over this - as she's making it all about her - and not the best interests of the child - which is what adoption is supposed to be about.<br>  I have 3 children - I love them all with all my heart.<br>  I have 2 mothers - it's exactly the same.<br>  An adoptee should NEVER be made to choose sides.<br>  <br>  ETA: adoptees need to know from DAY 1 - not years down the track. It's part of their story - they need to know.|`|w2NA1KuXaa	My amom started telling me my "adoption story" the day they brought me home.  She felt the practice was for her, so she would be comfortable talking about it to me.  As a result, I don't remember a time that I didn't know that I was adopted.<br>  <br>  I think it is atrocious, and selfish when an aparent keeps a child's truth from them.  It really has nothing to do with protecting little Johnny's feelings, and much more to do with not wanting to face the possibility of rejection, or of ever having to share.  That baby's history didn't start with her, and to pretend that it did is just awful.  What about things like medical history that could really have a bearing on this child's health in the future.  His history, roots, etc aren't hers to hide.<br>  <br>  A child feeling the pain of late discovery is entirely preventable.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	Well, I guess since your mother was 16 when you were born, you're probably not adopted.  If she was a little older, I would wonder if I were you.  If she's not willing to tell this child, who's to say she hasn't neglected to mention this to other children previously?  Your mother's motives are very selfish.  If I were you, I would promise to be the 'someone else'.|`|iVcaB9h7aa	Beyond the shadow of any doubt, yes.<br>  <br>  Love isn't dependent on "real", but its strength is dependent on trust.  If your brother finds out another way, he may start to wonder how many other things he wasn't told.  He may begin to doubt and his trust may be shaken.  Now THOSE are emotions your mother should be afraid of.<br>  <br>  Your mom should start now.|`|S5Lsbh0taa	For now just a buy a story book like "I don't have you're eyes" or other kids books on adoption. Kids understand better through simple stories with lots of pictures. The word 'adoption' at his age isn't really going to mean anything. Face he's just learning to talk and what things are in the world around him at the age of almost 2. Get used to finding ways of explaining things for each stage of his life and then he will grow with a gradual sense of knowing. Also life books are good to make for him. Again full of pictures and short sentences explaining how he came into your family and something about his first mum. Or 'Tummy mother' as some people like to use to explain it all. Just make sure its on his level of understanding.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	It's better than him hating her when he does find out and that she hid his truth from him. Its his truth, his story, and it is considered child abuse to NOT tell a child they are adopted. Its best to start telling him NOW. Most adoptees have ALWAYS know. Their parents began telling them as toddlers. NOT telling them is something adoptive parents do out of weakness, and it's disgusting.|`|AA12174100	in our adoption classes they said some people buy story books about adoption and read to the kids from when they were 2 or 3 years old. Start talking about it when he is young and it will be no big deal to him.|`|2f49jsLpaa	Yes, he definetly should be told, and she should start talking to him about it now. I know he seems to old to really understand, but you want it to be something he grows up always knowing, and not a big suprise he just finds out one day. We adopted both of our children, and they are only 2 and three, but we've already started talking to them about their adoption story, and reading stories about adoption so that they know from the start.<br>  <br>  Your mother needs to understand that he WILL find out one day, as someone will eventually tell him, and what will hurt their relationship is not the fact that he knows he was adopted, but the fact that she lied to him his entire life, and seems to think that adoption is a deep dark shameful secret. PLEASE let her know that telling him the truth will not deminish his love for her.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	YES.  You start telling him now, in words that he understands.  You never hide this kind of thing from a child.  The shock will only get worse as the time goes by if you don't tell him.  Find the proper words to use at each stage of his development.  He will never be too young to tell, but if you wait until he is grown, there will be trouble.
NaJPIOheaa	as for your periods being irregular, that is normal, coming off any birth control will make your periods out of whack while your body adjusts. are you having symptoms of anemia? if you are i would call the doctor back, or seek another doctor for a second opinion, and make sure your taking a mulitvitamin. there are herbs that are known to help regulate hormones, so your period and ovulation will become regular, and have helped me tons... if interested do some research on Vitex or Agnus Castus. since your irregular you can also use OPK's to test when your ovulating, along with cervical mucous and position. good luck & lots of baby dust xo|`|CuTvFlxTaa	Ive been on the depo twice.

I came off it and got caught 4 months later again.<br>  <br>  No one mentioned anaemic.<br>  <br>  If you are concerned see another G.P.<br>  <br>  The second link may back up your G.P's reluctance to think you may have anaemia.

e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	With our son, we ended up letting him run around naked for a week.  Sometimes kids who are wearing underwear or pull ups forget that they arent diapers and have an accident.  Letting him be naked and have an accident (get lots of carpet cleaner:) makes him realize what the feeling he gets before he pees is.  It also helps you realize what his signs are before he goes pee so you can try to get him on the potty.  After he starts going on the potty, put underwear on him.  Once you start potty training get rid of diapers completely and use pull ups at night until the are able to hold it through the night.  Good Luck.|`|TEG6O7sDaa	When I was potty training, I got the book "Potty Train Your Child in Just One Day" by  Teri Crane. I didn't try for just the day because to be honest I don't have ALOT of patience, but I did use pointers from it that helped to make my life easier. I also got a potty watch from the website : <a href="http://www.pottytimeinc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pottytimeinc.com/</a> because it can remind you every 30, 60, or 90 min that it's time to try and go potty. I would forget how much time had passed myself and this was a great tool to help remind me as well as him. We would wear it when we went to the stores and also at home just to keep us on track. Hope this helps you in your potty training "adventure"|`|qRDHEGHJaa	well unless he wants to nothing will work. I made it seem like my kids idea. Im sure he likes them dollar hot wheels?? well take a piece of paper hand it on the fridge with his name on it (he helps put it on) then every time he pees in the potty he gets to make one mark when he does number 2 he gets 2 marks. now when he gets to 5 he gets a how wheel have 3 for him to chioce which one he wants.  We bought our son a car for every line he made on the paper but trust me it worked alright first weeek we had to buy over 30 something cars so we cut it to 5 lol with our daughter and her babies. lol good luck with this.|`|SkOALXv9aa	They do have some new training pants on the market that when used they alert the child who is waring them as soon as there is the slightest drip.  This gives them a reminder to go to the potty chair and relieve them self.<br>  <br>  I am not sure what the name of the product is but we have seen it advertised.  You may want to check with your pharmacist.  This could be something that will help.|`|lN0GkKgaaa	Most boys aren't ready to start potty training until they are about 2 1/2- 3 1/2 years old. Closer to 3 though. They aren't like a girl who would be ready at age 2. It's about a year difference between toddler boys and toddler girls for potty training. <br>  <br>  But to prepare him to start potty training, read books about using the potty and even sit him on the potty and read to him about going pee in it ect. <br>  <br>  Reward him/ or praise him each time he goes to the bathroom in the potty. Encourage him to go too. When he first wakes up in the morning or after nap take him straight to the potty. After he drinks juice take him to the potty. <br>  <br>  Leave him in underwear. If he wets his pants remind him that he needs to use the potty. But remember, because you are starting him young you may get a bit more accidents. <br>  <br>  Sometimes waiting until they say they want to use the potty makes it better and easier to potty train. And less accidents.<br>  <br>  But remember, your sons bladder isn't as developed at 2 which can cause him to not be able to feel that he needs to go to the bathroom. <br>  <br>  Good age to start potty training boys-- 2 1/2 - 3 1/2 years old<br>  <br>  Good age to start potty training girls-- 1 1/2 - 2 1/2 years old.|`|pbrfZQ53aa	When it comes to potty training its best to start off young. The best method is the Fido-Potty Training Techniquee. When they poop or pee in their diaper or have a night time accident in their bed you take them and rub their nose in it. Then forcefully, showing a hint of dominance, yell "NO! NO!" Swatting their thighs and/or nose with a rolled up newspaper is optional but can get tricky if authorities get involved. Its best to instruct the child, if he is of speaking age, to automatically answer the question with the "I fell"-response thus alleviating you from lawful consequences or responsibility.

They are not very resourceful though I have noticed.|`|bd9bE5LRaa	Serious adults have better grammar my dear.|`|g7LaH8O2aa	Maybe it's time for you to go to a different website.<br>  Life doesn't go your way. cope with it.|`|SJgszogfaa	you are mean i am 12 and i use it not to goof off but to help me with homework|`|B3H7HIFGaa	my question is how this related to pregnancy??|`|PxlZtBUmaa	well to be honest,<br>  im different.|`|FDQg1ldFaa	leigh ure right...i gotta good question 4 u...i gotta huge bone er wut should i do wth it?????
lGcpXteaaa	lol....this made me laugh..<br>  <br>  Go back under your bridge love.....|`|3cMRhJHSaa	If you are pregnant than the baby is deffintly yours no matter if your boyfriend cheats or not. Your carrying that baby its yours.|`|h0dov8E0aa	If the baby is not yours i would shove it back in,feel me.|`|SjX72fPyaa	Well if your pregnant then I don't see anyway that baby cannot be yours....|`|DvnOIx1laa	I am sorry, but this cracked me up.!!! Thanks for the laugh!!!|`|YD9LxWHuaa	I don't get it. If you are the one pregnant. How come you don't know if the baby is yours? Sorry but that doesn't make sense.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	Well...I don't know you. But if you're pregnant then I'm 100% positive the baby is yours.
ZGXxP4vRaa	I had the same problem.  I used sips of Pepsi or Coke.  Really strong stuff and just tiny bits of it.  Then I sucked on popsicles.  I don't know how that happened to help, but it did.  Just eat much smaller meals and take smaller drinks and that will help your stomach settle.  Good luck and congratulations!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Well, that is something that should be treated by your doc.  For me I chew and suck on slivers of candied ginger (spice aisle and ethnic food aisle), it seems to melt the nausea away for me.|`|uxmqgmCCaa	ginger biscuits,dry toast,crackers,and eat little an often an sip water.|`|znkumaA1aa	If it's hyperemisis gravida I say that Marijuana is the only real cure. I would consider it safer than any prescription medications (which have terrible side effects). It's also safer than starving you and your baby to death. You don't have to smoke it..you can simply put a bit in your cheek  (like chewing tobacco).|`|FAGI8owFaa	I use to keep a bottle of water and saltines by my bed and have a sip and a small bite and get up slowly it helped me a little bit. good luck
8Cvv86Jeaa	Well they will not make you take a pregnancy test unless you tell them you had unprotected sex. Even then they can't MAKE you. But I think you may want to because what you explained with the bleeding is called spotting and this happens when implantation is going on. Which means your pregnant. But you should take a test. But Depo is pretty potent stuff. It can take up to 6months for your system to get back to normal. So just to be sure..|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You spotted because your body is not used to not having the hormone. With that said you can still definetly be pregnant or get pregnant so you need to get that shot ASAP if you are not pregnant and use condoms in the mean time.|`|nwWBddEnaa	i fell pregnant on the depo injection i wasn't due to get another one as my other one hadn't run out, i got told to go back for it when i had a period but i only had spotting then it stopped, i took a pregnancy test, it was positive, but i thought it was wrong as i was protected so i went to the doctors and had them run the tests and turns out i am pregnant, i would still get check or atleast take a test, i wish you all the best xx|`|ZGXxP4vRaa	Yes, you will take a pregnancy test before they give you another injection and you are not supposed to have sex at least 5 days before the test.  You can also request a blood test instead of urine test because they can pick it up quicker on the blood test.  Good luck!
3qI1oyFaaa	Pregnancy is counted from your last menstrual period (LMP), or 2 weeks before conception.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Because you start counting pregnancy from the FIRST DAY of your last period. You are about 10 weeks. Ask your doctor.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Pregnancy is counted from the first day of your last period, not by your conception date.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	You start counting from the first day of your last period. you need to call a dr. and start prenatal appointments. also you can go to whattoexpect.com it is a wonderful website|`|2ObqoJbKaa	because they consider you pregnant from the start of your last mentrual cycle.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	i would go with whatever your doctor says...

Love wont feed or cloth a baby sweetheart.|`|z77TERJGaa	I'm sorry.  That's gonna be rough. I don't know what to tell you other than be honest.  Sit your parents down and tell them straight up.  They're probably going to be upset and disappointed because you're so young, but when you take the risk of having sex at such a young age you need to step up and be responsible for your actions.  If you want to partake in adult actions you need to act like an adult and tell your parents because the best thing you can do for your baby is to get good prenatal care.|`|ex53YwSuaa	Tell them.<br>  Then run to the nearest 4-way intersection and shout "MY FATHER IS TRYING TO KILL ME!!"<br>  Hopefully another wierd parent'll pick you up and let you keep the baby.<br>  Then, have the baby whichever way you like..abortion or adoption.<br>  Or..you could keep it, I guess. But that wouldn't be fun.<br>  You thought you were just having some fun, right? Having sex?<br>  Well, HA! Look at you, now you're pregnant! Yipee!<br>  ..Honey, you've just ruined your life.|`|gRAaX6NJaa	I know its going to be really hard and  tell them what you think will be right. Just tell them you really love them and you really love your bf. and hopefully they will understand. the worst they can do is ground you. you have to say you want an abortion to have to doctors approve it
hIzQyflqaa	not really unless u miscarried before you knew you were pregnant but the hormones havent gone down yet! it could just be that you are only a few weeks and therefore baby wont show on scan!|`|96HWpdkFaa	Not really.<br>  You could have had a misscarige and not known it.<br>  Or if your before 6 weeks (even sometimes 6 weeks) it's too soon and they can't even see the baby yet.|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	I guess anything is possible but I received a positive test last week and I thought it was a false positive as well. After lots of research and ANOTHER dr apt. I found out that i was pregnant and you cant really get a false positive. You definitely have the pregnancy hormone in you.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	It is extremely rare to have multiple false positives. My guess is that there is another reason behind it. Did you recently have a miscarriage? if so that could cause tests to still come up positive. When the doctor did the ultra sound, are you sure the doctor didn't say you were pregnant. Since your so early, you probably wouldn't actually see the baby on an ultra sound, you should have been able to see the little sac, bubble thing that it was floating around in though. You should ask the doctor all of these questions. good luck.|`|sVPToYvKaa	Yes, it is possible. Although it doesn't happen regularly, my doctor told my sister (who was in the same case as you) that her hormone level was off and made a "false positive."|`|tcHkn0VIaa	nope your pregnant|`|tkpBDLwYaa	Have your doctor check for a possible ectopic (tubal) pregnancy.  This can be dangerous, so please get it checked out ASAP.  You are getting positive results from your tests because your hormones are indicating you are pregnant.  No baby in the uterus is a strong indicator you have an ectopic pregnancy.  I don't want to overly-alarm you, but this could result in a ruptured fallopian tube and serious infection.  Please ask your doctor to do another ultrasound of your fallopian tubes.|`|uLcUrQ8Yaa	You are more  likely pregnant. But either you had a miscarriage and didn't no it. Are it's to early in your pregnancy to see the baby in a ultrasound.  I had my first ultrasound at 10 weeks two days and you could see the baby clear as blue.  Good luck.
plI0WOrUaa	Could be pregnancy, or it could be your period coming.  You'll have to wait it out a bit.  That's the problem with early pregnancy symptoms.  They mimic your period symptoms.  Good luck conceiving if you  haven't already!|`|Llt5PTN8aa	Well there isn't much indicating that you're pregnant, but seems likely that you will be soon, good luck =).|`|pnMjJ3s1aa	u probably are|`|UaL28atDaa	Its possible you should take a hpt to be sure. Also take a look at this video to see if you have any of the early symptoms.

WZQKevt8aa	Just keep offering it to her or give her a sippy cup she can take around with her. Try cutting back on the juice and increasing her water intake, but if she won't drink more water then juice is fine. If you keep offering it to her she will end up drinking it and getting used of having more fluids. Good luck.|`|WWfL5tMvaa	When I started weaning my son I was worried about that. He was 15 months old and the doctor said that they need 12-16 Oz of liquids a day so i think you are doing good. Offer her liquids and if she needs them she will take them.<br>  best of luck
BlZSrsrmaa	yes u can!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  because even if the penis isnt fully inside u it does release sperm [come] and thats what gets u pregnant <br>  <br>  it was quite stupid 4him to do that without a condon<br>  if u live in the UK go to ur GP tomorow[make sure its tomorow ok]<br>  and tell then exactly the same thing and ask them can u have emergency contraception<br>  they will not tell ur family and know will know|`|28zqdoSNaa	If he went inside you, whether partially or not, it is possible to get pregnant. It all depends on his age. There are times when the pre-sperm are mature enough to impregnate. Take a pregnancy test to make sure.|`|oQDQSSSDaa	You're a virgin right? And he put his somewhat not all the way penis into, and didn't precome, then no you're not pregnant. I highly doubt it anyway since you've never had sex. :)<br>  Keep protected!|`|fJTjE8j8aa	I think you're okay (meaning NOT PREGNANT)|`|a8tCObqraa	u can only get pregnant if any sperm has entered the vagina :)<br>  hope this helps good luck x|`|5pZFw65Waa	That's a weird question|`|5Za0RAwtaa	depends where he put it|`|zB2PIUmzaa	i dont think u r! :)|`|ALvp7YRuaa	no your just fine i mean he didn't blast so yes your okay and you are not pregnant or will be... but be safe and don't let them take advantage of you...|`|oGHtaaCkaa	If he didn't ejaculate inside of you then you can not get pregnant. <br>  Take health next year.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	I would say that you are not pregnant. However there is always a chance with any unprotected sexual contact even if its minimal. Ive read about people getting pregnant from a towel.(men wiping their penis's on a towel and not telling a woman then she wipes)<br>  If I was you then I'd see your G.P and ask for emergency contraception and make sure you do it first thing. The amount of stressing you are doing tells me that you are not physically or mentally prepared for a sexual relationship or a baby. If you have to let a boy take so much control over wether he puts it inside you or not without contraception then you are asking for anything that may come out of it from sex, baby or even rape!!! Please speak to your G.P and ask for birth control not for any unwanted pregnancies for unwanted S.T.I's. Sex is best left for two consenting mature adults in a loving relationship. Its not the be all and end all. Learn to say no and mean no you have 100% control over your body and what happens to it. Concentrate on school.|`|dXDroPtfaa	Hmm, no, you can't..<br>  UNLESS-You felt some liquidy stuff sorta in your vaginaaa.<br>  That could be sperm. meaning you get preggo.<br>  OMG, BUT---sperm is REALLLLY TINY! So he could have prec*m...|`|dnG7fhnbaa	It's highly, highly unlikely...of course there is always a chance or semen being secreted in his natural lubricant and impregnating you...but if he only put it in there for a second then you're almost 100% safe.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	if there was any pre *** then maybe. Sperm can travel into the vagina.
GCPbKg9Eaa	I didnt have a belly till 20 weeks with my first pregnancy! it just poped over night.<br>  So not having one at 16 weeks is totally normal.<br>  <br>  My stomach was flat as a pancake till about 18 weeks. But I too had a bloated belly after I ate,, that at least sometimes made me feel pregnant!!!<br>  <br>  If you have good stomach muscles it tends to take longer to show up with your first!With your second you have already been stretched so it happens alot sooner!!|`|rHufcHwHaa	i wouldn't worry. everyone grows differently.  I didn't start showing til around 24-25 weeks, and i was 140lbs at 5'7 before I got pregnant.  It really just depends on the person.  As long as your doctor says everything is okay, you're probably fine.  I'm almost 28 weeks now and very obviously pregnant...which looks nice but feels kind of cumbersome.  Enjoy looking normal while you can! It gets old fast.|`|47BmzHbKaa	well you are having a baby and wait to see the results of your stomach|`|5JkRf9Y1aa	no, if the baby's heart beat is fine last time you checked then everything is ok (:<br>  <br>  i obviously wouldnt know but i know a lot of people who have been pregnant and dont get big stomachs. its not rare, stop worrying.|`|OWVXKKLdaa	Some people don't show until later and some barely show at all...<br>  It doesn't sound like the doctor is concerned.|`|laO3osrwaa	You might wanna check with the doctor on that if your skinnyeir|`|oIBR7FUIaa	When a lot of women get pregnant they tend to loose some of their own body fat. Between the puking and the choosing to eat healthier for the sake of the baby you loose some weight.  It just doesn't always show on the scale because you are gaining baby, water, and placenta weight at the same time. I personally didn't show till I was around 5 and a half months pregnant with my son, and my friend who was pregnant around the same time didn't show till then either, with both of her pregnancies. You should start showing in the next couple of weeks. If you are worried about it though ask your doctor, no question is a stupid question to them when it's your first pregnancy.|`|Qki6UtFSaa	I wouldn't worry, that's perfectly normal! Some women start to show as early as 12-14 weeks, and others don't show until well into the mid-20's.<br>  <br>  My belly suddenly popped out around 19 or 20 weeks. I'm 22 weeks now and getting comments about it all the time. <br>  <br>  If you are concerned about it though, mention it to your doctor at your next appointment.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ZGXxP4vRaa	Don't worry at all.  That is normal.  Some people just show earlier.  I am 7 months pregnant and a lot of my friends didn't even notice I was pregnant.  I just assumed they knew because I feel huge.  I started with a flat tummy too.  But, trust me, I complained about it and now I wish I enjoyed it.  lol  Good luck!|`|VcO87w4Daa	I don't think so, I heard you don't start showing signs as much until a bit later on. Now at 22 weeks you can start being worried. if your doctor says you are okay. then you are okay|`|APt16L4Kaa	tly see a doctor cause i dont think thats normal.
DVmDWDC4aa	Well early on in pregnancy you get lots of pains and pulling feelings and tugs and pokes and sharp pains. If its severe enough to make you lie down, or if you bleed, then it's cause for concern. <br>  <br>  Both times I was pregnant I had this kind of pain in the first few weeks.<br>  <br>  You have to remember that your whole womb is changing, your muscles are softening due to hormones being released, the ligaments - everything. You have to expect pains and sensations like this, they are par for the course in pregnancy.<br>  <br>  So, get it checked out, find out if you are for sure, its likely pretty normal.|`|HIO0yvK0aa	buy a pregnancy test,<br>  <br>  and also if your periods stopped your most likely pregnant<br>  <br>  however the doctor does usually know best <br>  <br>  =D|`|kaqPSgTVaa	By bump do you mean your butt? Your uterus is still below your pelvic bone so any pain higher than that is most likely not pregnancy related. You may have pinched a nerve in your back.|`|AA12030056	only the doc can diagnose you|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Quite possibly....could it be period pains?|`|3AXlgGgUaa	lol, sounds like gas to me.|`|L7S24gkEaa	ok i dont want to scare you but if there is a real chance that you culd be pregnant, and the pain is in the lower abdomen ( like period pain area) and to one side you should probably go straight to casualty.in january 2007 i had to go into hospital at 4 weeks pregnant because the pregnancy was ectopic. The pregnancy growing in the tube  is life threatening if the tube ruptures ( which mine did not , i was very lucky they caught it early ) and after treatment left hospital after a week. <br>  the good news is that even after an ectopic pregnancy most women go on to have healthy babies next time, ( which  did. my son was born in feb 2008)<br>  the reason im telling you this is not to scare you but to make you aware of the possible reason , the sympoms and to lt you know that there is always hope or the future. <br>  HOWEVER..... this is unlikely about 1% of pregnancies are ectopic. but i feel i need to mention it because it can be so dangerous. if the pain isnt to one side or very low down, or if you are not pregnant then i apologise for scaring you.<br>  if you are pregnant it could still be nothing, ligaments stretching or generall aches and pains are normal. <br>  any way good luck , if you arnt too concerned then keep your appointment tomorrow but dont leave it any later.<br>   best of luck|`|ayAWGaHCaa	Maybe the extra weight in your stomach is creating pain in your lower back. I think you shouldn't be too worried about anything, sometimes these internet sites can scare you for absolutely no reason.

Get another home pregnancy test and do it with your first urine sample of the day - it will have stronger pregnancy hormones in it.<br>  <br>  Good luck and i hope you are babes
kaqPSgTVaa	Take another test. The pregnancy hormone doubles every 48-72 hours. You may have not had enough pregnancy hormone in your system yet.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Day 36...I would guess no.

87WOSjwgaa	Maybe he is growing or teething. Have you tried teething tablets?|`|X6as2nOAaa	Is he still teething? Maybe growing pains? Ask the doc.|`|qWNVHEsJaa	Could be one year molars... which are awful.  My daughter cut all four molars within two weeks, and it was a very difficult month.  The doctor recommended tylenol and oragel.  Although the oragel doesn't last that long.  Cold washclothes, frozen bagels, anything he can chew on.  If you do not see any teeth cutting though... definitely bring him to the doctor!!|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	Have you taken him to a doctor to make sure he doesnt have an ear infection or something else?|`|yiPZ1UZAaa	Put him in foster care.

kaqPSgTVaa	Pregnancy symptoms don't stick with you your whole pregnancy. Most pregnant women don't have symptoms in their second trimester either. Since this is your first pregnancy you may not start showing until week 20. If all your prenatal visits have been fine then you are most likely fine. Relax (stress is not good for the baby or you). You are fine.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	You probably won't really show until 20+ weeks, and probably won't really feel any movement until then. You're not going to "feel" pregnant every second of every day. I'm 27 weeks and there are still times I don't "feel" pregnant... If I had to "feel" pregnant every single second of the day I'd lose my mind!!<br>  <br>  I'm sure your little one is totally fine, congrats on the pregnancy!! :)|`|FEg0PDdnaa	I don't see any reason to be concerned. Most people don't feel movement until 20 weeks or later. I didn't really start to show until 23 weeks when I was pregnant with my son and I wasn't in maternity clothes until 25 weeks.|`|0iUxfCMcaa	is this your first? if so then you may not feel movement till around 17-22wks and you probably wont start showing a baby belly till around then too.|`|YvgCqoCDaa	you should go talk to your doctor about it...that would be the best thing do do|`|dNlCfhD2aa	Stop worrying!!!  Not everyone has tons of pregnancy symptoms.  Since this is your 1st baby you might not feel any fetal movement until you hit 22 or 23 weeks.  <br>  I am 17 weeks, haven't felt any movement and am not showing.<br>  Just be thankful you are not one of the women that have vicious morning sickness.<br>  Also, if you have any more worries check out some pregnancy websites like babycenter.com and americanpregnancy.com.

Go to your local swimming pool and see when they offer their lessons. Also, I know that some swimming pools offer prenatal classes. You would still need to check at the pool close to your neighbourhood for an exact answer.
FEg0PDdnaa	I had an ultrasound last Wednesday and found out that the baby stopped growing at 6 weeks. I was supposed to be 9 and a half weeks at that point. I did still feel pregnant and I still do today. I still have the sore breasts, exhaustion, queasiness and aversions to certain scents. Some of them are starting to fade but they are still there.
pJgxPNTTaa	I would go to your DR. I had my 2nd c-section Dec 5th and i stopped feeling pain about 3 weeks after. (stopped taking pain killers before that though)  <br>  <br>  I would say it is scar tissue, everyone feels different pains though. I had desolving stitches with my first and i did feel pain for a few weeks longer than with my 2nd where i had staples (although i have a staple that is still in my skin...) anyways you should tell your dr only they can tell you if it is normal. If this is your first section it could just be your body trying to figure what to do and you are loosing weight and toning back up at the same time, so it could just be your body trying to catch up with you. But you best bet is to call doc. <br>  Sorry i can't be of more help.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Stomach or lower abdomen?   It could be adhesions breaking up at the scar site, if it's lower abdomen - I had that, it was like bee stings when I moved around.   But, if it doesn't get better I'd go back to see your doctor as there are other things that can happen, like hernias.|`|BX4Ja1Rgaa	yeah its gas pains ouch do they hurt what i used to do was drink soda in a can to help me belch so that the gas can come out.

And you don't usually start gaining any real weight until at least the second trimester, at which point you would know you were pregnant. I'm 27 weeks pregnant, and normal weight gain for this far in is only 16-22 lbs. As far as your other symptoms go, wait a while and take a test to see if you're pregnant. That's the only way to know. But I'd see the doc about your sudden weight gain, there could be other problems with your health if you've gained that much that quickly.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|UaL28atDaa	<a href="http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/video/watch/100090/Pregnancy_Weeks_1_to_4?" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/...</a><br>  <br>  Take a look at this and see if you are experiencing any of the symptoms it describes althought it could just be the pill messing with your hormones.

Same thing happened to the girls in my class.but if you have had any sexual contact then you have a posibility of being pregnant.|`|V7T7QDrhaa	if you had your period less than a week before intercourse than its possible but if its been longer than that I wouldn't think so.|`|W40HUC19aa	well if you had sex without a condom then most likley i hope it wasnt me haha|`|8YRJBrisaa	if you had your period den noo|`|EB63JHS2aa	no if u have ur period then ur not pregnant...u probly have somthing else..so check with a doctor|`|AA10990125	Instead of asking us, why don't you go to the drug store and take a pregnancy test.  That way you will know for sure.|`|gy6eUJZRaa	i wouldn't think so|`|g08ELuNmaa	no
vygYFdsSaa	Everything happens for a reason. Your circumstances could dramatically change in the next 9 months. Not knowing is the hardest part but just do things to keep your mind off it if at all possible. And try not to think about it as a bad thing--I had an unplanned pregnancy which I now consider to be a blessing. We never know what we need in life, maybe this baby (if in fact you are pregnant) will be the best thing ever to happen to you.<br>  <br>  I understand your feelings and I truly sympathize. I hope everything works out for you please email me if you'd like to talk, especially after you take the test. Best wishes xx|`|JDw1RDcaaa	there nothing saying you would be a single mum, cuz you might meet someone nice. There is nothing wrong with being a single mum. When i couldn't afford to buy a test i cleaned my house for three days until pay day to take my mind of it|`|sIr2fWh6aa	Just don't think about it in a bad way.  Who cares if you're a single Mom.. There are millions of women out there raising children on their own!  It'll be okay either way.  Just don't worry and stress.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I know it's hard when you have to wait. Just try to keep yourself really really busy. My mother and best friend were single mothers and they are GREAT mothers. Being married or having a partner doesn't guarantee perfect children. :) If you are pregnant you have just as much of a good chance at raising a healthy child as anyone else.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Take a bath, and rub one out.<br>  Why?  Cause it will help you calm down for one.<br>  And for 2...it will help bring a long your period if your not pregnant!
WZQKevt8aa	You are better off waiting until the day of or the day after your period is due because them '5 days before period is missed test' aren't as reliable as they are when you have missed a period.|`|ce8COixxaa	You can test sooner with those and might get your BFP! However, if you get a BFN, you have to retest after AF is actually due, because the tests are significantly less accurate days before. It's probably best just to wait until you are late- even though that can be soooo hard!|`|14RzmDTmaa	yeah they have worked for me.|`|dlOFWcU4aa	Depends on the person.  I have always waited till the day I missed my period or later and the results have been accurate thus far.  Good luck to you!!!
yH39NEXSaa	There isn't much blood in implantation bleeding. There's only a little. If you continue to wipe and there's more blood, that's probably your period coming.|`|NaJPIOheaa	hey dear... to tell you the truth, it could be either or. implantation bleeding occurs anywhere from 6dpo up to when your period is supposed to start. it also is very light, and by no means will fill a pad or tampon, but then again i've heard it being slightly heavier than the books say. implantation bleeding will also usually be pink, or brown... so so far it sounds more like implantation bleeding, but you never know! just keep an eye for it within the next few days, and relax! :) good luck & tons of baby dust xo|`|txSiQc7Waa	Well implantation can happen as early as 5 dpo or as late as 14dpo... usually the theme with implantation bleeding is it being bright pink. Since you've experienced this, I'd say it's implantation. So relax and wait around the day your period is supposed to start and take a hpt. Taking them too early can give you a false negative and a lot of heartache. Good luck and baby dust to you!
fOxS7EE7aa	i also had a miscarriage before, and my OB advised that the day you miscarried will technically be your "new period".<br>  <br>  so expect that your menstruation will come after the usual 28 to 31 days.<br>  <br>  It could take a little longer though, because of all the hormones that could still not have returned to your normal pre-pregnant state.  this could be delaying your next period.<br>  <br>  it is also a possibility that you are pregnant, but it is less likely because with the levels of pregnant hormones in your body, your body might still be "thinking" that you are pregnant.  and will not release your hormones to help you get your period.<br>  <br>  better to consult an OB regarding this.|`|c7f419243c5a31e1118c95c6e72ce929aa	You could definitely be pregnant again. There are many women who fall pregnant soon after a miscarriage and often don't have a "first" cycle. It's harder to predict when you actually conceived but it wouldn't be a problem as it would only be a week or two off. <br>  <br>  Take a pregnancy test to see if you are pregnant. Sometimes after a miscarriage the body takes time to regulate itself as far as hormones. Some women may not see a period or a return to their normal cycles for a couple of months.
WGAFP6mSaa	Whoa, your way older than him. You should be able to handle this.<br>  <br>  When he sits on you, push him off.<br>  When he makes fun of you, just ignore it or tell him to shut the hell up.<br>  <br>  If he continues to do these things to you, I would tell the bus driver and hopefully the bus driver will assign this kid a seat, therefore, he won't be sitting by near you any longer. Honestly, I think that the only reason he's doing this is to show off in front of his friend/impress her. <br>  <br>  Don't let him walk all over you like that!<br>  <br>  Edit: If I were you, I'd slap him right across the back off his head for not getting off of me.

Hmph.|`|Av9jeRAkaa	say hey I'm older, get the hell off, or else, I think he wants to show off in front of his friend, or talk to the bus driver, or just DON'T LET HIM SIT NEXT TO YOU, SAY THIS SEAT IS TAKEN!! stand up for yourself!|`|3dpIt3PIaa	Punch that asshat in the face.

4AZp8Quwaa	Yes, that is all very normal. My hair was very oily and my face broke out bad during my first trimester. After my second trimester, my hair got thicker and my skin started to have this radiance.

ztrRs62Daa	How old are the two of you?<br>  He is probably sh*t scared. Most men are at the prospect of becoming a father. If he is quite young then he is probably feeling like he hasn't lived enough yet and that it's too soon to be settling down. Even if he's not that young he is still probably feeling like he hasn't accomplished enough yet.<br>  <br>  But I think that both of you will regret it if you have the abortion. Although I am a keen advocate of equal rights when it comes to parenting, I still think that it is your body this foetus is living in and that it is your choice whether or not you let someone take it away.<br>  <br>  Also, don't forget that abortions can go wrong and leave you infertile.. I'm not trying to convince you either way, as this is your decision, just warning you, it is a possibility, but I don't know the stats.<br>  <br>  He must've had a little while to think about this so far, and if you think he's calmed down a bit you should try and get him to explain why he doesn't want the baby.. But he may just start shouting again..<br>  <br>  If you want this baby, you should have it. It may just be the best decision you ever make. But you would have to be prepared for the possibility of him leaving you.<br>  <br>  Do you have anyone close to you or him you could talk to about this? Your parents? His parents? They might be able to help you, or at least offer some comfort. If not them, then a friend? Abortion is a huge decision that many people regret. Even if you don't regret it, you would certainly think about it everyday.<br>  <br>  I really hope you decide and that everything's okay for you.. Like, really and truly. And remember, the sooner you decide the better. If you do go through with the abortion then it will be easier if it's earlier in your pregnancy.. It will probably be (a tiny bit) less upsetting and also there are less likely to be complications and such..<br>  <br>  I wish you well, good luck with everything, whatever YOUR decision. Not his. xxxx|`|QSodlfMraa	i can not believe that you would abort a baby because home boy dont have his mind made up, you really need to move on to some one with some more sense of life.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Ugh, that's terrible. Bottom line though, if you don't want the abortion, don't get it. You will regret that for the rest of your life!|`|UcgWrGaAaa	If you don't want it don't get it period.  He cannot force you to have an abortion.  Please be strong for your baby.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	u dint want an abortion we can tell men can be replaced your child cant  <br>  have the baby all will be good|`|Od73sfkxaa	You need to be extremely careful. If you tell him you are not going to get an abortion, what will happen? Will he hit you? Kill you? He seems mean, abusive, and unstable. From what you've wrote, he doesn't want a family. <br>  <br>  Most women who have abortions regret it, have nightmares, and wonder what that child would of grown up to be like.<br>  <br>  He has no right to act this way. You need to make a decision about if whether or not you want to keep the baby, and if someone like him will be a proper and good dad.<br>  <br>  Be careful with the amount of stress you are exerting on yourself with being pregnant.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck and I'll keep you in my prayers =)|`|laVH1Bz3aa	it is your body - if you want to go through with the pregnancy, then do it. keep in mind what the repercussions are. you can't assume he'll support you or the baby. he might break up with you.<br>  <br>  however, you should not be forced to do something you will regret forever just because you are afraid to lose him. tell your boyfriend how you feel.<br>  <br>  what you really need to do is talk to a friend or family member. support from here is not sufficient for what you need right now - go to someone who will let you cry on their shoulder and let it all out.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	do NOT have an abortion if you dont want to! you will regret that decision for the rest of your life. what if the baby come out as a beautiful healthy smart loving baby, the best thing in your life. youll never know if you have an abortion... especially if you didnt want to have the abortion in the first place!! if YOU are ready that is what matters.|`|4AZp8Quwaa	Don't you dare let his selfish ways influence your decision on this baby. Please don't get an abortion. That baby did not ask to be conceived, but it deserves a chance at life just like anybody else. Your boyfriend is a jerk, and could care less about your feelings. If he really didn't want a child, he should have thought about that and been more responsible before he got you pregnant. I am currently 8mths pregnant and would be absolutely devastated if anything happened to my baby. Pregnancy truley is a gift.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	do you honestly think if you give in and let him control you like that (which is SO wrong) that you'll just go on all happy? most couple like this end up resenting each other for being pushy. honestly if you want the baby keep it. your body your choice. he should had thought of it earlier. when my bf pulled that i told him im sorry but if he makes me choice between him and my baby i'll choose my baby. he came around the next day and realized how stupid he had been.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	YOU  dont need to do nothing for him.......if he is not willing to support you in this well im sorry he just does not care about you enough. if you want you baby then have your baby with or without him...without better he sounds like a douche with no respect for you. your using the wrong reasons to abort. please think seriously about this without him there, you may find it easier.|`|KfGa8Hdiaa	I am sorry to read about your situation. I feel terrible for you. I wish your bf was being more supportive. <br>  My first thought, like everyone else's on here, is that don't let him force you to get an abortion that you do not want. <br>  HOWEVER, please make sure that you do actually want the baby before proceeding with the pregnancy. Maybe you just want the baby because you love this guy, and not because you are actually ready for a baby. Remember that being a single parent is a HUGE responsibility, and right now you may feel that you want the baby, but only you can decide if you are ready to meet the challenges of being a single parent in the long run. I think being a bad, irresponsible parent is a bigger sin than having an abortion...it is of course TOTALLY YOUR CHOICE. <br>  Good luck!|`|PDmoIvRwaa	Is there anyone else who can support you during this time?  Your bf is forcing you to do something you will regret forever.  It is not like you looked at the ultrasound picture and felt nothing.  You cried in relief when he said he wanted more time.  Imagine how you will feel if you are forced to abort your baby.  There is no guarantee your bf will stay with you if you do have the procedure.  Then where will you be?  Talk with your parents, or your best friends.  If you don't want to keep the baby, at least give him or her a chance to live in the world and give them up for adoption.  There are so many loving homes wanting to adopt a baby.  It really takes a lot of sacrifice on your part to keep the baby and stand up to your bf to fight for the life of the baby.  I hope your friends and family will love on you right now and you find the courage to do what is right.|`|Q2OP7SOtaa	When i found out i was pregnant with my little boy who is now 2 and a half my partner was not happy. he too told me that the baby cant be his and how he couldnt possibly have got me pregnant..! i spent days crying and feeling very alone. <br>  <br>  He was 25 years old an d i was 21 however he thought he was too young? The best thing that i did was to talk to my parents.. i needed support from someone and once he knew that other people knew he wasnt as quick to bully me.<br>  <br>  He tried to convine me t abort the baby and i looked up on the internet some information about abortions, i am pro choice and abortions have there place in society. i myself am not the sort of person who could go through with it and forgive myself.<br>  <br>  Please think long and hard this is his baby but it will effect you in ways you could not imagine. If he truly loves you he will come to terms with your decision to keep or terminate the pregnancy but if you are not 100% dont do it. He has a responsibility to you and his unborn baby to support you in the decisions you make about your body.<br>  <br>  Good luck. I really feel for you xx
AA11083066	She would have to adopt the baby.  You AND the father would have to give up your parental rights.  Your best bet would be to see an adoption lawyer.
TRDCdWlAaa	Hey well its sounds like he is a player...he likes 3 others girls? No good...you don't need that drama... its probably hard to imagine him in that light because from what it sounds like he is an angel to you but trust me, from this point of view he is playing you...guys are very simple, they see something they like and go after it...he would tell you or make a move or something if he was interested.  Love is blind and it definently have your blinders on...you should read "he is just not that into you" ...u can probably download the audio on limewire...its a great book that will open your eyes to his foolishness....I know it sucks but u r young and there are plenty of better guys for you!|`|5pZFw65Waa	And you are a toddler or pre-schooler?
2673aaa82d073007e40aa43361da9190aa	My son did the exact same thing! Your daughter is probably going thru a growth spurt. Is she hungrier then normal? She might be teething as well. The best thing I found for teething is teething tablets. I bought mine at Walgreens. Just take 2 tablets and hold them under her tounge untill they disolve. You can also try baby orajel if she seems like she's in pain. Don't worry she's fine! My son slept like that for about a week and a half and then he went back to his regular sleeping schedule. Hope this helps:)|`|yKS2UI87aa	Every once in a while my son would do the same thing, my doctor said it was a growth spurt. As long as it isn't lasting more than couple of days shouldn't be a problem. If I have a question, my pediatrician's office is very good about letting me talk to a nurse (actually did it today my son is not reacting well to antibiotic for his ear infection) If your ped's office won't let you talk to a nurse try and find a different Dr.

My husband could feel it too.<br>  <br>  <br>  It is possible<br>  <br>  Congrats|`|DTYHoinVaa	yea you feel it sooner, but dont be surprised if it comes and goes. I felt it at 14 weeks consistantly for a few and then nothing for like 5 weeks. Its normal though.|`|plI0WOrUaa	Usually with your second pregnancy you feel movement quicker.  I think its perfectly normal.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	i started to feel mine kicking at 15 weeks im 18 weeks now.|`|i88MbPB3aa	yes|`|9HAuyoSYaa	Most definitely. My son who is my only child was moving at around that time. In fact later on he would even kick up a storm if I was wearing anything to restrictive on the belly. I think even before they are born they already have their only little personalities. He definitelly kicks up a storm now at 3 whenever he is mad just like when he was in a fetus.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	I am also 16 weeks and I have been feeling "flutters" occasionally for the last 10 days or so but today i had a more noticeable movement not quite a kick but i could tell it was my baby! Perfectly normal. I love being pregnant- Enjoy it :)|`|NblWmEOaaa	I'm 18 weeks pregnant with my second child.And this time I felt my baby move at a lil over 15 weeks and now at 18 weeks it is full blown kicks.|`|tkpBDLwYaa	Absolutely not!  You have a health baby there.  Best wishes and congratulations.|`|A0tWlG94aa	its not too early
NYVshNgMaa	Does it feel like a heartbeat? Because that's what my belly feels like from time to time, and my aunt told me that it's just all of the veins pulsating. I mean WE'RE growing a life inside of us.|`|plI0WOrUaa	Yes it really sounds like hiccups.  Its a funny feeling, but I had that little jumping of the uterus too.
hVVALFAPaa	You can try to pull it back GENTLY. Try a little at each diaper change. It may bleed a little if it is too firmly attached. <br>  <br>  If it still won't 'unstick' then tell the doctor at his next visit. <br>  <br>  If you do get it unstuck, then rub a little Vaseline (petroleum jelly) on it each day so it won't reattach until it is healed.<br>  <br>  Make sure you pull it back at least a couple of times per week to prevent this. It should completely 'unstick' or not have the tendency to stick by the time he is a year old or so, though you should check and pull it back occassionally even after that. Once he gets a bit older (potty training age) you can teach him to do it.|`|q1YDp1y3aa	This is called a skin bridge or an adhesion. Basically, the skin has healed itself to the head of the penis. The doctor will want to undo the adhesion. Talk to your doctor before hand. Some doctors will simply yank the adhesion and rip it open. this would be extremely painful for your boy, so be sure to tell the doctor NOT to do that. He should be provided with some pain relief before anything is done. <br>  <br>  Also don't be talked into a re-circumcision. These loose circs are common and better for your son. Doctors give looser cuts now because they found that boys who were tightly cut (so that they looked circumcised as babies) grew up to have painful erections, bleeding erections, hairy scrotal skin pulled onto the shaft, even bent penises. Doing a second circumcision would greatly increase your sons risks of these problems after puberty. Having a little excess skin won't hurt him, but removing too much is very serious, and practically irreversible.<br>  <br>  After the repair, simply push the skin back at every diaper change and coat it with vaseline to prevent readherence. Continue with the vaseline until your son is old enough to do it himself, or he grows into the skin. -Neb|`|AA11987492	That is because by circumcising him, yau are actually signing up for the work that you were trying to avoid. If you had left him intact, you would just wipe like a finger, because the foreskin is attatched to glans like the fingernail is to the finger, sometimes until puberty.<br>  <br>  Since you DID have him circed, you were supposed to pull back the remaining skin and clean under it with every diaper change. This is to prevent the adheasions which he is now experiencing. The remaining foreskin has reattached to the shaft, which is not only unsightly, but risk for infection as well. <br>  <br>  Doctors are leaving more skin these days because when they took more, as the boy grew, he experienced painful and bleeding erections.|`|W2z5dCrmaa	I'm not in favor of circumcision, but I'm not here to push on that.<br>  <br>  I find it disappointing that getting that thing cut is the big ta do, but after, the instructions seem to be lacking now that the deed is done.<br>  <br>  How to take care of it after is more important than getting it done or else you get left with a mess and what to do with it isn't obvious. I turns out to be a whole lot more than just smearing a bunch of Vaseline every change.<br>  <br>  I feel bad for you and others needing to extract information that should have been given even before the circumcision was done, to help in evaluating whether or not you really wanted to get it done.|`|qImMwhUHaa	I just kept my boys' penis' skin pulled down at diaper changes and when it would start to attach itself I would pull it back down. It would seem to stick and you'd think it would hurt but they never cried.  I had a friend who's son had to go to the doc and he pulled it down like that too but it hurt him but it was over with quickly.|`|2LflHv23aa	That is happening to my boys penis also. I talked to his doctor about it at his last doctors appointment and she told me that when I change him to pull back the foreskin a little bit when I clean it. She said if I don't he may need another circumcision.|`|Ug5twRBDaa	My hubby and I circumcised our son also. He too is 5 months old. Our pediatrician has always had us fold it back to clean with a wipie during diaper changes. So I have not had this happen.

t4HXotwEaa	I think it's different with everyone.  Your Dr. should let you know if there is cause for concern.  I'm also 12 and a half weeks.  I went to the appt. thinking i was going to get a lecture for gaining...14 pounds.  Yikes!  But, my Dr. didn't even look sideways.  Don't worry about it too much.  Just get good prenatal care.|`|S4DNQkFraa	Some woman lose weight because of morning sickness. I had it light and I lost weight. You usually don't start gaining more weight until you hit 9 weeks. I'm starting to gain weight. Doc's suggest you gain about 20 pounds. That 20 pounds is the baby, the amniotic fluid, bigger breasts and water retention. That way, after the baby you only have like 8 pounds to lose. Good luck and eat healthy!|`|HPRlEWu1aa	none really .. u dont need to consume those extra 300 calories a day until ur 2nd trimester .. so keep on ur regular diet .. im in my 14th week right now and havent gained anything. i never had morning sickness either. just ate what i always did ..|`|mqHL4UcRaa	You typically pack the pounds in the 2nd & 3rd trimester. I believe its the 2nd trimester that you gain nearly a pound a week. Then 11 pounds during the 3rd trimester. <br>  <br>  At 12 weeks your little one only weights around a pound. You should be okay. Your doctor will be weighting you at every visit. So he/she will let you know your weight status.|`|UaL28atDaa	<a href="http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/video/watch/100090/Pregnancy_Weeks_1_to_4?YAFT" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/...</a><br>  <br>  Take a look at this it will explain what you should be expericing (and any wight you may be gaining) at each stage in your pregnancy. Good Luck`|`|i9M0U9Meaa	none really. most women are expected to lose weight they're first trimester due to morning sickness and lose of appetite. i lost 4 pounds my first trimester.|`|kDftsHXjaa	non actually, because of morning sickness, but you never know, i actually lost weight bc i was throwing up and i didnt want to eat at all.|`|bTlhBX3daa	In the first trimester the baby is very tiny, and you don't really need to gain any extra weight, or only a little if you do. You are completely on track and that is normal. <br>  <br>  I am 30 weeks with my first, and he should only be about 3 pounds now, they gain most of their weight in the last few weeks of pregnancy. I have gained about 25 pounds total. <br>  <br>  Congrats to you.|`|UkQuMykiaa	I gained one pound in my first tri and second tri combined (by the end of my second tri I had only gained three pounds.  I gained almost 47lbs in the third - ALL water and babies because I had my babies 4 weeks ago and am already 9 lbs lighter than pre-pregnant weight) and I was pregnant with twins.  I am not sure that this is normal or recommended. You could ask your dr if you are concerned or if they won't give you answers (as mine didn't) you could always research in pregnancy books or online.  One thing I can say is just always make sure you are getting proper nutrition and taking your vitamins no matter what your weight gain. Sorry can't be more help.|`|KfGa8Hdiaa	I think you are just fine. I hardly gained anything in the first trimester....like maybe 3-5 pounds. The doc. said there was nothing to worry about, and that many women also lost weight during 1st tri. <br>  <br>  Now i am 25 weeks pregnant and have gained 15 pounds!|`|plI0WOrUaa	It depends on the person.  I heard 3-5lbs.  I didn't gain anything until around 18weeks is when i started gaining weight.  You are normal.  It just goes to show that you aren't overeating!!  Which is great for later.|`|NiOjHyfKaa	at 12 weeks i had ganed 4 lbs and now at 16 weeks i gained 4 more lbs (all together 8 lbs)|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	in my first trimester i lost 3 pounds.|`|jCvdW3WGaa	I actually lost 8 kilos due to severe nausea. depends on the individual.
hVVALFAPaa	It all depends on the country or state.<br>  <br>  In most states in the U.S., the baby cannot leave the hospital without a name, but you have (I think) 6 weeks to change it with no reason given. After that, you pretty much have to go through the courts to do a name change.<br>  <br>  I don't think the U.S. has any rules. I saw on the news the other day that someone named their kid "Adolph Hitler." You also read about the starts naming their kids odd things like "Moon Unit Zappa," 'Dweezle." and "Apple."<br>  <br>  I think the only hurdle you would have would be the social security office. They might reject your claim to a SSN if the name could not be entered into their system.|`|28QPS6V9aa	There isn't a strict deadline that I'm aware of. The only reason you even need to name children is for social security and you're not required to get them a social security number right away. So I suppose a person could go without a name forever. You can change your name or your babies name whenever you want. Even at the age of sixteen you could change their name. Again, no deadline. And there are no rules about naming. You're free to name whatever you please. My friend took a little over two weeks deciding on a name for her daughter. So for weeks everyone just called her the baby. :)|`|Wb9oqcWDaa	Your baby can not leave the hospital with out a name.  It has to do with the paper work and all that is submitted while there.  Like birth certificate, social security etc.<br>  <br>  I am not sure of the rules for changing a name.  Sorry|`|IjkPBYlkaa	before being checked of the hospital you have to name your baby so basically you have up too 3 days to decide..you name your baby something that you like and its unique to you or has a meaning to you...i hope that helps|`|TunJmklmaa	you have until you have to fill out the birth certificate|`|oWLznROuaa	in the uk you have 28 days to register a baby i think, and i would guess until its all official you can change it when you want.<br>  <br>  As for "rules" about naming a child there is none - its down to common sense.  I once heard of a guy who's son was given the christian names of all the players in manchester united football team because he was such a big fan - poor wee sod had something like 17 middle names!|`|aae6df3d65f6ca7dcced752916509d6caa	Listen its your child, you can name your babie anything that you want even swear words. There are no rules on how to name your child. You take as long as you want to name your child, its perfectly normal.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	From experience usually the day after you given birth, there is a special person that comes with the proper paperwork for naming your child. Your child cannot leave the hospital without you filling out those forms and a name (in NJ anyway). As far as rules on naming your child, there are none. Also I'm not to sure what happens if you want to change the name after you've already picked one.
em1Zqnymaa	Yes they do say that glass bottles are better but I used regular ones cuz i didnt want my daughter attached to those then have to carry glass around once she could hold it herself ya know? I agree with you she should not buy stuff and it will hurt her more but she is her own person and I think that is just her way of coping even tho she knows she may have lost the baby. Just be nice to her and be there for her either way and best of luck to you and her with this situation.|`|qImMwhUHaa	Glass bottles don't contain "BPA" (I think that's what it's called). It's a chemical in some plastics that can have harmful side effects. There are plastics that are BPA free though.<br>  <br>  Concerning your cousin, I would just be quiet. She may be setting herself up to get hurt but apparently it makes her happy in the moment to be planning for her "maybe baby". Having a few bottles around won't make that big of a difference in her grieving if you does lose the baby.|`|7W3iEtW8aa	Don't stress everyone is very opinionated on babies and stuff.  You do what is right for you, and she can do what is right for her.  Be careful, and sensitive if she is not pregnant, she might get jealous.<br>  I was not able to breast feed - is this your first? - so have a back up plan just in case.|`|tZU9k9zNaa	I dont know about glass bottles but BPA free bottles are best.Shop for those if you're pumping.I hope everything goes well with your cousin's pregnancy.Lets pray that it wasn't a tubal or anything serious.She should wait till she's atleast in her 2nd  trimester|`|oXIYHsDaaa	The great thing about glass bottles is that we know 100% that they are safe, in 5 yrs there's not going to be a recall on glass baby bottles like the recent one for BPA. Breast feeding is the best option, but you are right you will probably still want a pump and at least a few bottles for if you need to be away from baby. I use BPA free plastic bottles because honestly they're cheaper and I pump directly into the bottles and cap them and pop them in the freezer just like that. I don't have to worry about them breaking if they get dropped or cracking when they are frozen.|`|iTEf1dP3aa	About glass bottles this makes a lot of sense, I used drop ins to tho...less hassle. About your cousin, dont get frustrated, she may be in denial. Deep down she is hurting she may lose her child. You on the other hand already are pregnant, if anything be careful not to hurt her feelings.....just be there for her because her situation seriously tough! Think of it this way, God does things for a reason, this could have also been you.......

ZDqdYhdGaa	I agree with you on not doing a DNA test while you are pregnant. <br>  <br>  But I do not recommend giving the child the fathers last name unless you are married. You may think that you 2 will end up married, but there is a chance you may not, especially since it didn't encourage him to ask you to marry him when he found out you were pregnant. <br>  <br>  You will later regret if you break up, giving the child his last name, because you will end up the primary care giver and every where you go, doctors, school, daycare, etc. You will have a different last name than your child. And good luck getting him to agree to changing it....won't happen! But since you are not married, the babies name, both first, middle, and last name are up to you 100%.<br>  <br>  And yes the father has to sign the papers first, but why would you want to give the child the fathers last name if he isn't going to be signing the papers?|`|Wb9oqcWDaa	The baby can have any name you give it.<br>  <br>  My husband and I were not married when our son was born, so I will tell you what we were told.<br>  <br>  After your baby is born and you are in the hospital your boyfriend will be asked to take a paternity test, at that point if the test says it is his he is liable, if it says it is not his he is not liable.  <br>  <br>  Or he can choose to forgo the paternity test and sign a paper that says he will take care of the baby no matter what.  He will have to listen to a recording explaining what his responsibilities are even if the child ends up not his.  It is his choice what happens.|`|SSvgklu8aa	no he does not have to sign the papers for the name you have chosen for your baby.the papers he needs to sign would be a voluntary acknowledgement of paternity. In which case he is voluntarily signing papers saying he is the father. If he doesn't sign it there will be no problems giving the baby his last name. When it comes to the birth certificate, his name won't be on it.|`|ZKxgqK3zaa	I think it depends on the state.<br>  I had my daughter in Louisiana and my fiance and I are not married. My daughter has his last name. The only thing he had to do was sign an affidavit for proof of paternity. Basically it is a piece of paper saying he takes full responsibility of our daughter. I don't believe that he has to sign to have his last name. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|9pDEhA1Xaa	I notice most single parent are giving the child the father's last name.<br>  You'll need his support, so take it easy, don't run him away!|`|Wz1O9m53aa	My boyfriend was required to fill out quite a bit of paperwork when our son was born.|`|JNDrlLjMaa	I'm not sure but I thought the baby could just inherit the father's last name.....|`|TunJmklmaa	its your choice|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	You can name your child whatever you like. The father does not have to sign in order for the child to still have his last name. Also your marital status has no affect on naming your child.|`|2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	In Illinois, the father has to sign a "Proof of Paternity" paper in order to give the baby his last name, unless you're married.

KyFCYs0Yaa	I would make the kid take the toy to goodwill, or salvation army where a less privileged child could appreciate the toy!

9zwSclnLaa	Just walk up to him, do the nice "hello".  Ask him how he is, strike up a conversation about something that happened in school.  Like how the football team did at the last game, or if he saw the Oscar's, or how he thinks he did as far as grades on these upcoming mid reports.  Something nonchalant and casual like so.|`|HtNaKQLOaa	Hey gurl! Just try to talk about something non-specific.

oPaqWJOOaa	That's ridiculous, kids are kids, they can get messy doing absolutely anything.

They are going to have to clean the bus at the end of the day anyways so what difference does it make if there's a little extra dirt on the floor to sweep? (If they don't clean them each day then they should!) I am a teacher and I would advise my parents to speak to the transportation department and have your brother's bus number ready and the name (or description) of the bus driver.  You could also speak to the principal/teacher but he/she might have you call transportation as well.|`|gtr3CGU5aa	I very seriously doubt she has that kind of power over a child having muddied their clothes during recess.  Find out what the laws are in your state for home schooling.  <br>  In Texas a child can be home schooled any way the parents want...... as long as they can pass the GED test when time comes.  <br>  The school gets money for every child who attends, so if your parents threaten to withdraw the child from the school over such a harsh rule, it would not surprise me if the school will back down on this issue.|`|3pMQE32Vaa	no that is not right! well it depends if the school is really serious about that kinda stuff, but i really dont think that is right!|`|w7XNcmihaa	That just not right.

Personally, I have always been able to feel this, but mine only lasts a few hours to a day at most.<br>  <br>  i don't know that the bc pill or nursing make it more evident, but perhaps you are just more sensitive to what's going on in your body now, post baby [which i assume you are as you referenced nursing]|`|C0kvzLiFaa	You could just be having cramps.

Even just a simple walk everyday would be great if you aren't one to normally excercise.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	I agree prenatals!! and try using just condoms don't get on the shot or pill or any of that bc sometimes it takes longer to get all of that out of your system, I was on BC and got off of it in JULY and havent been able to get pregnant :( ..|`|PQw92IGHaa	Prenatal Vitamins<br>  A Well Balanced Diet<br>  Working Out or Walking<br>  Yoga or Pilates<br>  <br>  Sounds like you are doing everything right on track!

28QPS6V9aa	Yes, because it is stretching and probably getting tiny tears from your belly getting so big.|`|749K6Hysaa	I had the same thing happen to me in my last pregnancy. Supposedly my doctor said it was because of the scar tissue. When the baby is moving and kicking etc., that will cause the pain (my daughter was super active).<br>  Remember your uterus is really stretched out and your skin is becoming more sensitive. Try to massage it while laying down. <br>  You don't have much longer to go, so I hope this helps! <br>  Good luck!|`|z77TERJGaa	It's normal but unfortunately I don't exactly know why. My belly button hurt towards the end of my pregnancy but it was because my daughter constantly kicked it.  Good Luck (get the epidural)!|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	yea it is smtimes the babies kick it or just set their foot or fingers on it you might try massaging it a little|`|XpqQvQsgaa	i agree with bubba b|`|EAzyjftKaa	Yep I agree too. mine never hurt or stick out.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Your skin is stretching put some oil on it or cocoa butter.
Cx5Zo7IIaa	Any kind of hot oil treatment will help make your hair softer, apply oil of choice (almond or soybean if you want something lighter) Put a towel in the dryer, to wrap your head in to keep the oil warm. Or you could mash up a few avocados a put that in your hair they have an amazing amount of oil in them. Good luck|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	It's probably just the hormones if that was something that worked well for you before. I work in a salon, and asked one of the hairdressers about my hair because I was having a hard time styling it as I usually do. She told me that your hair can change a lot during pregnancy. She told me mine went from being really fine to kind of coarse.|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Your hair will become thicker & stronger during pregnancy. Once you reach your 2nd & 3rd trimester, you will notice that your not loosing any hair. <br>  <br>  Depending on your body & hormones, your hair will either become dry or oily. If its oily, I'm sure its softer.|`|z77TERJGaa	I think it the hormones and the prenatal vitamins (if your taking them).  The prenatal vitamins are notorious for increasing hair and nail growth and making them both stronger.
kibCT4bkaa	its bad...but unfortunately im one.<br>  i dont think we are ready to be mothers but i know that i will be the best mom i can be.|`|96HWpdkFaa	I think when your in jr high and highschool and pregnant it's sad...but for the girls who keep their babies and either give them for adoption or keep them and have suppot at home, I'm proud of for not getting abortians and taking the easy way out..<br>  <br>  I'm 21 MARRIED and pregnant and Some people tell me I'M to young! What the heck!|`|QSodlfMraa	i think it is nothing to post a question about.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	really, they are too young to be having sex. but, seriously, there isn't a excuse when there are so many contraceptives; the pill, vaginal inserts, condoms--the more different ones you use, the better off you are. people should at least be smart. <br>  it's really sad that they have to grow up at such an early age and miss out on a major/great part of the teen/going into adulthood stage. they have to become an adult in nine months, which is hard to do.<br>  i feel sorry for the children with teen parents who cannot financially and or emotionally support their child. it's a sad sad thing, when there are so many eager people willing to take these children in, because they can't have their own.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	I think they are stupid jackasses for running out and getting abortions because they wanted to play big person, but i have a lot of respect for soemone who will own up and do whats best for their child either by raiseing him/her or putting the child up for adoption|`|QYYWBrG7aa	there is no age limit on what age u can be a mom.i just wish the girls that want adoptions and abortions should keep there legs closed.|`|9ofXOa0Saa	I am 15 and trying desprately to get pregnant.|`|sRy2SKpXaa	Well, seeing as how I was 15 when I got pregnant with my 3 year old son Anthony, and had him at 16, I don't think anything of it. I'll admit, I wouldn't go around telling people to do it, as it's very very hard to do, but i'm not going to judge someone who is/was going through it. I also think it has a lot to do with the individual girl. Some girls (like myself) mature and grow up throughout their pregnancy, while others, remain selfish little children who are totally not capable of raising a baby. Being pregnant for me was an eye-opener, and I quickly put myself to the side and my son at the top of my priorities. I was also a single teen mom (very long story) for 2 years, which was even harder. But, on a happier note, his father and I wound up getting back together and married and we're now expecting another little boy in April. I'm now 19, the baby is due the day before my 20th birthday. And while most people would still consider me a "teen/young" mom, I don't. I FEEL quite old to be honest. Maybe it's the wear and tear of motherhood that does it. But I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. I love my son, always have, always will and i'll love this new boy just the same.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and it doesn't always work out good, like it did for me. Sometimes the dad's don't ever come back. So you'd be stuck all on your own.|`|jCvdW3WGaa	I think it's not always their fault. Sure, there are some girls who will sleep around and have unsafe sex and whatnot, but when you don't know the specifics of what actually happened, don't judge.<br>  <br>  I know this from experience. I was raped when i was 16 and became pregnant because of it. I was still a virgin when that happened. I wanted to scream that at every person who gave me a dirty look. People are way too quick to judge, which i think is sadder.<br>  <br>  Still, i kept the baby and turned out to be a pretty good mother.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	i think age is just a number and anyone who thinks it "sad" or "horrible" or whatever, needs to mind they're own business. im 17 and 18 weeks pregnant. graduating high school this year, work about 20 hours a week, got a's and b's in school and doin just fine! age doesn't define how good a parent you are. so i think if a young girl has the guts and strength to take the responsibility of being a "teen/young" mom. then more power to her!! even before i got pregnant i used to idolize teen moms because they are so strong.|`|AA11542929	i think they should wait.. pregnancy aint easy at all.. its a true blessing to have a baby but alot of work and pressure to handle during pregnancy...and even after wards.. young girls should wait on sex or should be on birth control and using condoms if they wanna have sex... <br>  im 19 and pregnant and dont regret it at all.. just i dont like who her father is to her..|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Depends on how young and if it was on purpose or by accident. If they are married, happy, & able to take care of their young then good for them. <br>  <br>  If it was just from pure immaturity (not having any education on sex) then I feel sad for them.|`|plI0WOrUaa	It has to stop.  I don't get why so many young girls want to get pregnant so young.  I had a great time as a teenager, and am glad that I waited until I was an adult to start a family. It just boggles my mind.|`|3w7VztEWaa	I think it shouldn't happen but if it does that everyone should just shut up and be happy for them.<br>  what else can they do..they are pregnant it's a little late to lecture them and talk trash about them.|`|rUPjr7hjaa	I think it's so sad.|`|NblWmEOaaa	I was a very young mother I got pregnant with my son at 15 and had him 3 months after my 16th birthday.I'm not saying it's something girls at that age should do.But it was my choice and  I love my son and I'm a wonderful mother.And now I'm 18 and 18 weeks pregnant with my 2nd child.|`|01ntBgaPaa	One I think that by posting this question you are being WAY to hard on them.<br>  <br>  Alot of them don't plan on getting pregnant but still step up adn make responsible choices either choosing to parent or giving the baby up to a family that can raise the baby in a good home.<br>  <br>  Yeah having lots of teenage mothers is not good but looking down on them doesn't help the situation.|`|k0oJurVmaa	Its makes me sad to think that people are wanting to party instead of starting a family. Our grandparents and their parents didn't have a "early adulthood" as soon as they got out of high school they started their familys. That's what life is about. Not HAVING FUN and all that crap. That's all commercial.|`|tWV1aVS9aa	I'm 22 and pregnant with my first I'm in a long tern stable relationship and people think I'm also to young....so my question would be "if there is a wrong age, what is the right age?|`|fSwEPI85aa	it's sad and unfortunate but i wouldn't say they are stupid.<br>  everybody gets carried away sometimes and when you are a teenager you don't always think.<br>  but if you think you're old enough for sex, ask yourself if youre ready for a kid.
1enIWBGnaa	First of all, a 1-year old knows nothing about birthdays; it's just another day to them.  Invite family over, have a pot luck and make a cake.  Don't worry about birthday parties until he begins school.|`|DeXRWlR6aa	Have an afternoon party after nap time, it helps a lot when all the kids are rested. For the first birthday, most parents just do immediate family so even holding it at a family member's house would be okay. Keep it simple, take lots of pics and don't stress. Be sure you have a mini-cake for the birthday boy to make a mess of! If you're making his cake, I suggest a dirt cake. I made a simpler version for a cousin's first bday last month. Made a yellow cake w/chocolate icing & crushed chocolate graham crackers and sprinkled on it, looking like dirt. Then I put gummy caterpillars on it, which the birthday boy loved.|`|7W3iEtW8aa	Just make sure you don't do the party right before nap time, will make all the little guys grumpy.|`|ZLiolsNJaa	dont waste ur time and money wait till  he is old enuf to enjoy it...|`|Q6Bzggmpaa	Hi - Is there a mother and toddler group that your son attends? I run a toddler group and like many we offer for parents to bring a few extra dishes and a cake to playgroup on the week their childs Birthday falls on. Balloon, banners, party bags etc. can usually be organised by the parents to be put in the room ahead if required. All I would say is dependant on the group you may need to just OK any additional adults with the organiser beforehand and also just check everyone is OK with you taking photos.<br>  It is nice especially for the younger ones because the childs Birthday is celebrated with lots of other little friends in an environment that the child is familiar without a great expense.
bfP8tjPKaa	You should contact the authorities immediately. The girl clearly had it planned, she attacked your child  once they were no longer in the care of the school thinking she will get a way with this assault. I wish you & your daughter the best, no 12 year old or child at all should have to put up with this. MAKE SURE the parents are notified first of their childs behavior.|`|XF1y4wMmaa	Find a wittness|`|oGHtaaCkaa	Any witnesses?|`|1ZGDnSX4aa	yes you can take her to court! no madder what you can get her to court, but her punishment may only be dollar fines<br>  <br>  you can go to court for anything you want|`|9zwSclnLaa	You should definitely contact the police.  This is assault and the girl can be arrested and retained for it.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	Yes.|`|4d8420be4f044c1627ede2b5585dd409aa	You need to contact the school, the girls parents, and the police asap! Since they weren't home from school the girl can be suspended. Depending on your daughters condition you may be able to press charges. You may also want to contact a lawyer if your daughter was seriously injured.|`|hVVALFAPaa	Call the police.<br>  <br>  They may not arrest a 15 year old but you will have legal documentation that this kid needs attention and help.|`|W3jxmyVMaa	ur daughter is goin 2 have more fight when she older <br>  have somebody teach her how 2 fight so she <br>  can win some fights

ahnB52V4aa	You are just stressing.   If you skipped a whole day's pill, I might say you could have a very slight chance of being pregnant, but unless you are VERY susceptible to getting pregnant, I'm 99.9999% sure that you are not. give it a few days and don't stress.  A lot of other things can affect your period like eating habits, less sleep, sickness, etc.|`|Q2OP7SOtaa	very very slim! you will be fine its normal to not have regular periods when you first start using hormonal contraceptives, your body needs to adjust also you should not have a period untill you stop taking the course for 7 days, you should bleed 2-3 days after the last pill, it should be lighter and alot less painfull than a normal period.|`|XpqQvQsgaa	when you take birth Control it always don't work and condoms can break so u mit be and u mit not be but take a blood test it is better then a preganncy test. that will give u some answers|`|9hrJfhIIaa	You're not pregnant - when I was on birth control (for 11 years) my period regulated itself to come on the 3rd or 4th pill into the sugar pills. Stay calm, you'll end up getting it.|`|z77TERJGaa	Taking a pill a few hours late shouldn't affect your period.  I could see if you completely missed pills the chances of getting pregnant rise but not after a few minutes or hours.  I know my friend HAS to take the blanks because if she doesn't her period is always late.  I would just wait and take the last few pills and see what happens because chances are you're stressing yourself out for nothing.
DNyQYKLHaa	Very Hard to put a percentage on this sort of thing.<br>  But you had unprotected sex, so there is always a chance.<br>  Best thing to do it take the pill asap, but the longer you leave it the less effective. Then it's a matter of waiting for your period. If there are any signs of pregnancy take a pregnancy test then, but tbh theres not much you can do now apart from take that pill. But it's pretty much useless if you wait 3 days I think.|`|EAzyjftKaa	Any time you have unprotected sex you have a 50-50 chance of getting pregnant. So if you don't want a baby use condoms in the mean time.|`|8uiH6iRbaa	if you had run out of the pill then why would you be having unprotected sex !!!!!!! surly if you didn't have the pill you would of had the sense to use condoms !!!|`|hX7zhyIoaa	as you are on birth control you sound as though you are not trying to concieve. so im sorry to tell you but everytime you have sex there is always a slight chance of you getting pregnant as you had it on 3 occasions you have just tripled your chances and made them even higher as your birth control has ran out. hopefully there is still some left in your system.. (birth control hormone) but just incase it still wouldnt hurt to go and get the emergancy contraceptive also known as the morning after pill or plan b. this can be bought over the counter prescribed from your g.p or a family planning clinic the longer you leave it the less chance you have of it working.<br>  <br>  hope i helped x|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Well even though you are out of your most fertile days, sperm can live in the vagina for up to 3 days. So if you have a good swimmer in that batch, then yes you could get pregnant. <br>  <br>  I actually ran out of pills too and had unprotected sex with my boyfriend, were now 29 weeks pregnant.|`|plI0WOrUaa	Pretty good, i wouldn't risk it at all.  The minute you miss your pill, your body goes back to regular cycles, including ovulation.  I really wouldn't have sex without a condom unless you are planning for a family.|`|V9ZT22owaa	ummm he didn't *** in you did he...me and my bf have been together for 2 years and a month and we have had unprotected sex for a year and a half i am not pregnant yet and i am not on birth control.<br>  <br>  PS: don't judge me. you will be fine i have a feeling. people are always paranoid like this when they have unprotected sex.|`|z77TERJGaa	It's possible still to get pregnant but if you're past ovulation the chances are slim.  And if you aren't ready for a baby then he should be wrappin it up until you are back on the pill.  Good Luck|`|XpqQvQsgaa	it is 99.99 percent possible i think u are but im 13 and i got raped by my mom's boyfriend.
PcjOgAacaa	I had one child, then found out I have pre-diabetes.  I got pregnant without trying, but lost the baby (missed miscarriage).  Then I couldn't get pregnant.  Had to go on fertility meds, and even then had an ectopic and lost 4th baby at 19 weeks.  I'm still working on TTC, though.<br>  <br>  My A1C is also below 6, my morning numbers are the only ones of concern (they are between 100-110 without the Metformin that they have me on).  <br>  <br>  So, I'm not sure if it is the diabetes or other unrelated stuff that is giving me the fertilty troubles.<br>  <br>  I guess my only advice is to make sure your ob/gyn knows you're diabetic, and therefore you'll get more scans, appts, checkups etc. than the regular woman.  Don't be afraid to seek fertility help if you haven't achieved pregnancy after 6 months to a year.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bWyKAFwuaa	Yes, sugars that are out of wack can really mess with your ovulation but if you have your sugars under control is should be okay, and you could also try glucophage
mqHL4UcRaa	It's going to be uncomfortable when your 30+ weeks.

If it is too much pressure on your back, ask him to instead of grabbing your hips, to caress/rub your back. It's important for him to take the time to get you in the mood. Don't be afraid to try new things too. Your about to have many sleepless nights ahead of you, so go to the adult toy store and make your nights alone together fun! <br>  Good Luck :0)|`|plI0WOrUaa	What about spooning, with him behind you, as you are both on your side. This way there is support for your back, and not any pressure on your belly.  Good luck|`|z77TERJGaa	Get on top that's the best position for you and baby when your preggo.|`|5ohdDhmHaa	id say spooning, i think u would be pretty comfortable
Q05rrSX4aa	Yeah life can suck sometimes!  <br>  When I got pregnant my husband and I weren't married at the time, we had NO money and a 1 bedroom apartment.  We had nothing!!  It was so hard, but you know what?  We pushed through.  Our son is 7 now and we have our own house, business and car!  So you have to realize that things go bad sometimes, but you are the only one that can help it get better.  Get a job and get your life together.  You can't just sit and feel sorry for yourself all the time, you have to do something about it.  A baby isn't going to change anything at this point, if you are already broke and having a hard time you have to do something about it anyway.  Don't have an abortion....just think about what you need to do.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|hAuemuWTaa	OMG! u owe ur bf money, he should be giving u money to help u long and for medical bills ect.

I also thought about abortion very occasionally but I know I would never do it....it was just a depressed thought as I dealt with all this new stuff happening.

I have done this many many times. <br>  <br>  Good Luck to you! And lots of Baby Dust!|`|t8HPCzrOaa	wait until a missed period than test hun am in the same problem am just waiting until a missed period good luck
sQdBCs54aa	Hello this is John and Tara:<br>  We invented computers and we will take them all back to our warehouse if you dont send this to 12 people.<br>  This is because some mean people are using up all the letters in the world by typing a lot.<br>  Computers will break once a global limit of one billion letters is typed, thats a flaw in the computers.<br>  If you don't send this on it will mean we will come to your house and take this computer.<br>  <br>  Thanks|`|cj7sSPZEaa	If it has been within 72 hours of sex you can go get plan B, but any longer than that and you may very well end up pregnant.  Wait until your period is due, and if it doesn't show, take a test.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	how the hell do u not know hes not using protection? <br>  yes u may be pregnant genius|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	I think your just being paranoid - its too early for most people to feel symptoms altho it is possible.<br>  <br>  wait till your period is due, and test if it doesnt come.<br>  <br>  In future make sure protection is used - its not just up to him to make sure, you should make sure too.|`|NcHsbFXhaa	are you kidding, you did it 5 times, and your only just found out that he didn't use protection - hmmmm, why wouldn't you think of that each and every time of the 5 times?|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	You didnt know before he wasnt using protection?  How the hell did you miss that one?  SMRT hey?<br>  You wont know until 14 days after the sex.  I hope for your sake your not pregnant...|`|9hrJfhIIaa	How do you not know?!<br>  <br>  Condoms feel like a baggie on his ... yeah, you need some sex education and to take a pregnancy test|`|mqHL4UcRaa	This is all in your head. Here's why...<br>  <br>  You wouldnt be bloated this early. If you just had unprotected sex the other day, then you may not even technically be pregnant YET. It takes approximately 2-3 weeks for the fertilization process, implantation process, and for your body to produce a high enough level of the pregnancy hormone to feel symptoms or test for. So no you wouldn't feel nausea until you are 6+ weeks pregnant. Same goes for the other symptoms, you wouldnt notice them this early.<br>  <br>  How did you not know he wasnt using protection?|`|9KpidWBEaa	your being paranoid you would not have morning sickness and definitely would not be feeling the baby move at 2 weeks pregnant.  wait til you miss your period and then worry.  my suggestion is to chillax and next time make sure ur boy is being responsible, and you should also be a little more responsible.  carry condoms with you just in case your partner is inept and doesn't carry them with him!  You should make your motto no rain coat no playing in water!   if you don't want a baby.  <br>  <br>  what about birth control pills, plan b?  there are lots of ways to prevent pregnancy if you don't want to have a baby.  good luck with what ever happens.|`|RiwgGWT9aa	This is Frank<br>  <br>  I am in charge of fashion in the world and there is a problem.<br>  All the fashions in the world have been used already and we need to start again.<br>  If you do not pass this on to 17 people, we will not tell you the new fashions so you cant use them.<br>  This will make them last longer.<br>  <br>  Thanks|`|lLcF7Jo2aa	If it's within 3 days and you don't want to be pregnant right now, you may want to get a morning after pill.Also, be sure to get checked for STDs.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	how did you just "find out" he didnt use protection??? you should of known whether or not he put a condom on or not. you wouldnt have any symptoms yet. maybe its the flu.|`|DTYHoinVaa	way too early for that, implementation hasn't even happened yet. Duh 5 times and just didnt notice. Come on now.|`|hX7zhyIoaa	after the 1st time you should of realised that he didnt wrap it up. its your own fault.<br>  <br>  was you drunk?<br>  on drugs?<br>  confused?
