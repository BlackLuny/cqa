20090203091217AAmwZGH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i tell if she likes me or not? What are some things to look for and how do i tell her i like her?	This girl that I have liked for a long time is coming to visit me for the weekend. I want to tell her how I feel but I don’t know how to. I was thinking we could see a scary movie or something to see how she would react to it. Like burying her face in my shoulder, leaning on me, stuff like that. What are some signs to look for when were hanging out? How can I tell if she feels the same way about me? What do I say to her when it comes time to tell her? When is the right time to tell her? Do I tell her before she leaves? Any information or suggestions are much appreciated EXCEPT rude comments. Thank you.

There's this really good looking boy that's 3 years older then i am    and last year when i was a freshmen he never talked to me but added me as a hot friend on face book. This year when he comes by the school to see his friends he stares at me and it's pretty obvious even my friend noticed him looking at me in that weird way do you think he likes me or what?

20081111210546AAlEaKG	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does it sound like he used to like me? ?	There was this guy that I did like for a while in one of my classes. (I don't like him anymore) I think that he liked me too? We are in the same group thing for our class (but we started using comps. so I don't see him that much, or talk to him either) And me and a friend (that I sit by on the comps.) were sitting at a table, and he was like, "i'm gonna sit by you guys so i don't get in trouble". and he sat next to mee. :D we were all talking, and i asked him about random stuff. and he wouldn't look me in the eyes. 0__o      the computers are in rows, (as I said) and i'm really loud, so every time that I say something, a lot of people can hear it. When i would say something, he'd always glance over at me, or if i asked a question, he would answer me. :P even though he's like....6 comps. down. hah. he used to always come up the isle, and ask the teacher something, and he'd kinda look at me, i guess. ha. and this one time i was talking to the friend before class ended, and he came over to our group thing. :D      but i guess he has a girlfriend now? he doesn't do this stuff anymore. according to another friend of mine.   oh, well.      did it sound like he liked me? I don't like him anymore, so it's not like i'll lose any sleep over it.
20081111211250AANZIjS	Family & Relationships;Friends	I've had it!!! there's only so much you can stand? right?	This girl has been toying with me forever what should i do? She always wanted to be with me even though i was with another person, then i gave in time and time again, but she always pulled back when everything seemed ok. i would always get hurt, and i would always hurt the person that i was with at the time. then she dated this random guy for some weeks and then she talked to me again, i went out with her for a month after she broke up with this guy, and she admitted that the only reason she dated him was to get me jealous. after we broke up,(we broke up because she freaked out and cared too much about what her friends thought of us). She cused me out in front of my friends, and then started to cus at me in texts, i never payed attention to them, and i havent talked to her since then, this was in september, and then the texts again, but this time she told me that she was sorry for everything she had done. now im working on a new play, ( im an actor) and she tagged along to help the stage manager who happens to be the random guy she dated before. i dont know what to think im so confused, i dont know weather shes playing that same jealous game, or if shes just fixing to get on my nerves, and to top it off today she tried to talk to me and when i ignored her she cused me out yet again? she said i should be over it.. but to me the wound is still open and it still hurts, the worse thing about it is that i still have feelings for her but and i dont want to give into my feelings because so far everything with her has ended in chaos.. what should i do, i'm at the end, ive never been so confused....please, give me some advice i really need it..

20081224111737AAdMzRO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to determine if she likes ?	I'm horribly oblivious to determining a females attraction to me. I've lived my whole life on a hockey rink, not really bothered by a girl. Until now! I recently asked her to a hockey game and dinner. We chatted it up all night. I dropped her off, and on my way home she texted me about having such a great time. Then she said that we'll have to go skating one time. We didn't talk the next day then she texted me again saying how she went and practiced skating for when we go. My question: should I take this in a friendly aspect, or should I just pursue it? Women are so hard to read! And it's especially bad when you've got an idiot like myself. I hate sounding cheesy on Y/A, but hey, desperate times call for desperate measures!

20090105175834AAO3p8b	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Me ajudem com esse louco? é muito interessante a dúvida!!!?	VALE 10 PONTOS!      Olha só.. algum tempo atrás.. um cara me adicionou e disse que iria me assassinar... Eu até acreditei no come?o e comecei a me cuidar mais... Porém... + - um ano depois, ele voltou a aparecer e passamos a conversar...    Um dia ele fala que é meu protetor   Outro dia diz que sou o melhor amigo virtual   Outro dia liga a webcam e aparece ser um cara descente! (Eu suspeitei que era um cara gay, mas n?o bloqueei pq acreditei que pudesse ser uma garota... e depois ainda disse que era um amigo dele...)   Em outro diz que é um jogo de lógica e que eu tenho que adivinha... e ainda complementa exemplificando como sendo "jogos mortais"      A gente conversa, às vezes some por uma ou duas semanas... mas sempre volta... O incrível é que, apesar desse ser confirmar que é um jogo, eu n?o sei qual é o objetivo... sempre quando pergunto ou ele enrola ou sai...      Dai, um dia, comecei a chutar uns nomes de pessoas que pensei que poderia ser... E o cara foi falando: "vix.. vc tem a cabe?a fraca.. acho que vou ter que abrir o jogo..." (mas é claro depois ele fala que quem tem que resolver o mistério sou eu!) E um dia falei um nome, e "ele" disse "N-??O DE NADA" e sumiu...   Ele sempre escrevia errado... e era visívelmente, acreditem, de propósito...   ele me deu algumas pistas... como "ERVERNAUTI N′`STREHR GYGINTHE"   "SOU SUE=EU =+;-JEI +.NYT"   e "agente só se ve no ponto" (diz que me ve sempre)   e uma vez também disse:   "cara só vou falar uma coisa    vc esta ferrado comigo mas,    sem mim vc esta mais ainda.    Se voce esta sem mim vc ta ferrado    Se esta comigo vc esta ferrado    se vc esta comigo vc esta bem." (eu corrigi para melhor compreens?o)         Seria um psicopata, uma garota, um psicólogo fazendo doutoriado ou um cara gay mesmo?   Depois de tanto tempo eu sei que ele n?o vai me matar... apesar de me xingar e dizer que roubei a namorada dele (o que eu sei que n?o é verdade, pois na época...) ah entenderam certo?      Alguma idéia?

20090214080747AAUQ4mD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I secretly visited my girlfriend, And her neighbor saw me! What to do?!?	My girlfriend has been away for a week, She got braces. And she's sick right now, So I wanted to go check on her. But, We live in a closed society! Boys ain't allowed to be with girls! Her family know me very well, And they don't mind me visiting, Just that she was home alone...   So, They live in a flat, We went to the roof, I hugged her and told her that I missed her so much... That's all, Just as she was gonna leave, Their neighbor was coming to the roof for something, But he saw us, And returned to his flat with a serious face!      Her neighborhood don't really know me, I live a bit far from them, But, I don't want her family's reputation to crash because of me! I don't want everyone to hate them, I don't want her parents to hate her...      All I'm asking, Is a solution, That "if" her neighbor would tell her parents, What should we/I/she do to stay out of trouble?   Her parents are already having a lot of problems, I don't want to be the reason for their family to break up...      We promise to never meet secretly again if someone would help us out...      P.S: We usually just tell the truth, But that won't help much right now,,, If we don't find a better solution, Guess we'll just have to do so...

20090220203754AAL2zQm	Family & Relationships;Family	PLEASE answer?!?!?!?!?	Ok, well, about three months ago, I met this guy, Nathaniel, and we've hung out a TON since then... Like, a LOT. He's very emotional and metro... a lot of people think he's gay because of some of his mannerisms and how he's into fashion, but he's straight. I think he's very emotional because of his past... he lost both of his parents at a young age... awful deaths, too... I won't get into that... he's been in foster care, and never had a stable home. He's moved from place to place. Anyways, he's one of those guys who's really into hugging and stuff. He almost ALWAYS is hugging me or has his arms around me or something. I like him as a lot more than just a friend, and I think he might like me back, but anyways... He was living with this really nice foster family... they were thinking of adopting him, but he just told me today that he heard them saying they might not adopt him after all... they can't afford another kid during these hard times, or whatever... But he's SUCH a nice person... one of the nicest people you'll ever meet... and he's a junior, and soon he won't be able to be legally adopted anymore. He's never had a regular family... he's lived with grandparents and foster families... I feel so bad for him, because he was SO excited that someone wanted to adopt him, and he loves the family... I can't imagine giving up someone like him... I mean, I know times are hard, but when I look at him when he's upset, I don't know how anyone could turn him away... I don't know what to do, or if there even IS anything I can do, other than be his friend... but is there anything I could do?! Please, please just help me... just give me opinions, advice... I don't know... just, please?

20090220203325AAWzRNp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you help me through this?	Hi. I am in a relationship with a wonderfully amazing man. I love him dearly. We both currently attend different universities, I'm in Memphis, he's in Nashville. He's two years behind me.      I will be graduating in May and going off to attend medical school, which will increase the distance between us. I'll either be in Georgia or North Carolina.       I already miss him so much even with these 200 miles separating us, when we're not together. And I'll be moving this summer, and I know that I'll miss him even more.       I don't want to end the relationship, so please do not suggest that. I'm just looking for words of encouragement. He does plan to attend graduate school wherever I end up for medical school, but there's at least another two years before we'll be together physically in the same place. I know that he does plan on proposing also...      If anyone can just give me words of encouragement on how you were able to deal with a long distance relationship, I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much.

20090220204926AAXHCM3	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I leave my husband who is in prison?	I have been with my husband for over 9 years now. When I first met my husband I had no real idea about his past. He was a ex felon on parole for distributing drugs and also he is a drug user. When I met my husband he was this way. We have 2 children together. My whole story is really long and complicated. But I will do my best.    My husband got me pregnant over 8 years ago. He then left me to go back to prison for selling drugs. I waited for him and moved everywhere he was so he could see his daughter and we could be a family. He was in prison over 4 years. He got out started using drugs again and eventually went back on a parole violation. He got out went back again on a parole vilolation and then had went back another time this would be his 3rd time. During these time's he was out I had to put up with alot of crap. My husband always accuses me of cheating, he constantly degrades me calling me many horrible names that no one should stand for. He would always leave me at home for weekend's and come back and not call or nothing. This has gone on a long long time.   And I am a christian and feel that maybe he will change so I stay with him. I want to know what I should do for me and my children.    I really can't stand waiting for him everytime he goes back to prison. It break's my heart everytime and I get very emotionally depressed. I am finacially drained from not having the support that I need. Should I stay with him (me being a christian) and see if he changes or should I try to move on? I really don't want to be separated and he really don't seem like he want's to change. I have waited now over these 9 years for him going back and forth to prison. I feel cheated.   Another question. He always accuses me of cheating. Could this be a sign that maybe he has done so? Please someone give me some advice. My heart is breaking

20090220205307AAgApxj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it ok for a 16 year old girl to be with a 44year old man with parental consent?	I was just curious if it is morally ok, I mean if it is for love I don't see why people say it is wrong at all.      I happen to think it is perfectly fine, i think that anyone should be allowed to be with anyone they love no matter what and I think even a 14 year old should be allowed to be inlove with whoever and her parents should be allowed to consent. I am an 18year old girl with a 44 year old man and we are very much inlove and engaged, and I think that if we met 2 years ago and were inlove then it should be legal and morally ok.

20090220212145AAVQ63U	Family & Relationships;Family	What do I do if I hate my little brother and his annoying friends?	My little brother, Jakob is a f*cking annoying a*s. He is 9 years old and never, ever does anything I ask for help with... he never even says anything nice, all he ever does is swear (the "C" word being his favourite) and he doesn't even get in trouble... but when I say something like the "S" word I get yelled at and told that I am teaching my brother bad language! He learnt all the swear words from his 9 and 10 year old friends at school... I hardly ever swear and he even admitted his friends told him!   Now... whenever I ask him to stop running around screaming and hitting me (and me only) he just goes even more crazy... while my parents just stand around and don't notice... I usually try to keep myself from hitting him back... cause I would hurt seeing that I'm 13... and I usually don't. I just push him back if he gets extreme and he still goes on. I tell my mum that she never tries to stop him when he gets crazy and she should but she just says "Don't tell me what to do".   F*CK! (As well as finding an answer I am also seeking anger relief, the anger having been built up inside me... so excuse the foul language).   Anyway, you'll notice that in the title I also say I hate his friends... I do because they seem to come to our house every SINGLE day... after school on weekdays and for like 6 hours every day on the weekend. I mean are their parents trying to keep them away.   Then when they are here they never show any respect... they scream and laugh and play pokemon.   Then they stay for sleepovers and all night I here them punching and kicking at the wall just to prevent me from getting sleep.   Then when I ask my mum and tell her that they shouldn't come everyday she just says "Don't tell me what to do" or "Jakobs allowed his friends over if he wants". Sure! My assessments and tests mean nothing! Everyone favours him... "Jakob do you want the last ice-cream (which your brother hasn't had before but you've had most of the pack)"   They are here just too much and when I come back from going out with them here something important to me or expensive for me is broken!   What do I do?

We always joke on msn like "aww  i missed u soo much" bla bla bla .  But then he tells me that all these girls r fighting over him becos he gives them the wrong impression.

Like, a LOT. He's very emotional and metro... a lot of people think he's gay because of some of his mannerisms and how he's into fashion, but he's straight. I think he's very emotional because of his past... he lost both of his parents at a young age... awful deaths, too... I won't get into that... he's been in foster care, and never had a stable home.

20090220221119AAtNnVB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	College girl... should I try again or let it go? Best Answer?	Ok so I'm a 20 year old sophomore in college. I have terrible luck with women and all the girlfriends I've had , they asked me! So I can't read girls to save my life. Anyway...      I met this girl in one of my classes, she's cute and seems nice. I talked to her after class one day for about 15 minutes and she seemed interested in me I thought. When we split up to go seperate ways she asked me where I was going...I said up to main street to get some lunch, wanna come? she just said ....no I gotta get home. end of that.      Well I took that as not a definitive turn down. So I have tried to talk to her a few times since then. She always seems totally nice BUT....she has forgot my name 3 times! Every time I talk to her she can't remember my name.      Lastly....we were doing group exercises one day where we had to survey people around the class and find out what they did on the weekend. I asked her if she talked on the phone with her friends. She told me she doesn't even own a phone. Hahaha so I guess asking for her number is out.      My question is....should I even bother with this girl? Is she definately not interested? Would it be worth the risk to just ask her out?

20090220211846AACgcah	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you ask a girl out?	I'm a 17 year old guy and i've fallen in love with my friend. I fell in love with her the second i saw her 3 years ago. She is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen and she's really smart. Whenever I see her I get weak at the knees & get butterflies in my stomach. She takes my breath away and whenever i see her i feel like i have to use all my strength to keep myself from kissing her. I lose all rational thought when I see her. We're in math class together and i can't keep my eyes off of her. Seeing her is the best part of my day. I've tried to ask her out but i freeze up every time. I've tried to ask her out everyday for the last 3 years. I've even tried doing it over the phone but I just freeze up when I try to ask her. I'm trying so hard to ask her but I just can't do it and its driving me crazy. She would be the perfect girlfriend/wife. I love everything about her & when ever i see her i always get lost in her eyes. I just cant resist that look in her eyes. and it so cute when she plays with her hair. I think she might like me but i'm not sure she keeps telling me that i'm really smart and she tells all of her friends and her parents that too. and sometimes she teases me and she just asked me if i would come to her soccer games. and we've been studying together every week for math. and she said that she likes how i'm always there for her. I really want to be with her. I would b a good bf. I would adore her and shower her with kisses all the time. Her kiss has to be like heaven. I've fallen in love with her and I want to marry her. My life would be perfect if i had her. Meeting her was the best thing that has ever happened to me. I think about her day & night. my grades are slipping b/c i'm constantly daydreaming about her in class. not being able to ask her out is driving me crazy. And whats even worse is that she is going out of state for college. I know I have to ask her but I can't get the words to come out. Not knowing if she wants me is unbearable but I can't get myself to just ask her. I just can't stop thinking about her. I know that she is my true love and soul mate I just know it. I have to have her. She's the first girl I've ever liked or even had a crush on. I wish she knew how much I love her. It's just so hard to ask her out and I need to know how. How do you ask a girl out?

Even if I didn't want sex and I respected your decision, would you still refuse to go out with a non-virgin.    I'm just curious and wondering if it would be a MAJOR turn off to a perspective date. 
20090220164255AAGGhN3	Family & Relationships;Family	I can't stand my jobless boyfriend and his 3 yr old daughter. I need help!?	I am 24 with a 7 yr old boy and 4 yr old girl. He is 32. He takes care of 2 kids 9 amd 10 that are not his and I adore them...then he has a 3 yr old girl and I just can't stand her. I have no idea why. I feel so guilty. I will find any reason not to be around this chils. He was working when we meant and then got laid off and I dont think he is even trying to find another job. I know he is a package deal and I have to accept all the kids and his lack of working motivation, but I feel like he always puts his kids on a pedastool and puts my kids in time-out. I want to work things out with him but I dont know if we can if he doesnt get a job soon and if I dont learn to except the girl. I know I should try to talk to her or spend time with her...but seriously I dont even like to talk about her or listen to her on the phone in the background. Why does she irritate me so much?

One day she wanted to play with my star wars action figures that had not been open yet. When I caught her opening some of them I was so upset. The only way to make her stop was to punch her, so I made a first and got her in the stomach. She then threw up and ran away. I said I was sorry and explained how it was her fault. Why wont she take me back, and why did she break my heart?

20061224200655AAOoEzp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How does a guy normally react when...?	he finds out a girl likes him and he likes her back? I have a huge crush on my guy friend and it got complicated. I finally got over this guy I liked for a year so I become more obvious about my current crush and apparently he figured it out about a month ago. I was completely oblivious that he knew about my feelings (no one had told him, he just assumed and went to our mutual friend and goes "I think she likes me") but he started talking to me and flirting a lot more. Our mutual friend told me that my crush "doesn't know who he likes" but I swear he knows more than he's telling me. My crush gets jealous (I have a lot of guy friends) and is always play hitting me and asking me about myself. He also said "Well I didn't pay NEARLY as much attention to you then!" when I brought up the past. He compliments me a lot but is he just trying not to hurt me? I'm so confused.      What signs should be there if he really likes me back? I'm clueless when it comes to this stuff. Please help.

About a year ago me and my wife were having some problems but we were trying to work them out. I let her go out with some friends and when she came back the next day she told me she kissed a guy at this club. I didn't make a big deal of it because she said she drank alot which is unusual for her, but still i keep it in the back of my mind. Well the other night I went over to a coworkers house there were a few of us there, 2 of them went to bed and me and this other girl stayed up and watched tv. I am not sure if I have feelings for this girl or I just think shes cute and we flirt a lil at work but never got the hint that shes into me. Well she asked me to give her a back massage and she ended up cuddling up next to me then we started to kiss. Now for some reason I cant shake it. I am not sure if its because I have feelings or if its because I knew I messed up. I know it wasn't right to do and I do love my wife but I cant shake the kiss. If anyone has any advice that may be good or bad telling me how screwed up I am either way just let me know.

20090220213507AAHlhwI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If you are married...?	If you are married and your spouse was invited by his/her single step-sister and his/her single cousin on a cruise to three exotic islands leaving you at home with your step-child...and your spouse actually told them yes they would go would that not be wrong of them?      Tell me is my husband wrong for this...he got invited to a cruise to go to these exotic islands but it was only for him.  I'm pregnant and our baby is due two weeks before the date of the cruise.  That is why he refused to go but I asked him if I wouldn't have been pregnant would he have gone and he told me yeah he would have.  And I asked me so what about me and our son (who is my step-son) and he told me that I had a problem with him going because I have a jealous problem and I don't trust him because I'd be worried about all the women on the cruise.        Already since I married him I gave up two trips to europe to see my grandmother with my mom because I couldn't take him and my step-son with me.  Already he took two trips to Florida while I stayed home and with our son.        and he was serious when he told me if there wasn't a baby coming he really would have taken that ticket and gone.  Tell me, if you are married especially with a young child isn't that something you give up?  Or if you did go on a curise and you were married would you go without your spouse living the other at home with a two year old child?
20090220213839AAZI8tK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would You Trust This Honesty?	Im hoping for some opinions on my current situation. Recently my fiance admitted to cheating on his ex partner, the mother of his 3 year old son. He told me that she was always accusing him of cheating, when all he was doing was working late. He said he got to the point where he had had enough of the accusations so he went out and did it. He was more or less saying that because she thought he was he may as well. He also told me that he hadnt wanted to be in the relationship for a long time and seen it as a way out. So which was it, him or her or just a lame excuse?  Now the thing is he didnt actually admit to her that he cheated, she went through his phone and found her number and called the girl. He said that he felt extremely bad, though what was done was done. Now here's my confusion, do i keep trusting him because he was honest enough to admit it? Ive never accused him of cheating so i guess im safe there right? Im not so sure. The thing that i question also was that he said he met this girl out at a bar, after he had been caught out he went on to have a relationship with her.?? Was it already happening for it to flow straight into a relationship? See the thing is now, i appreciate that he was honest about it but i would have rather not know. I mean everyone makes mistakes and can change but im now struggling with all the what ifs. I told him if he wasnt happy with me then to straight out say it and just end the relationship dont look for an easy way out. He said he would. Im just struggling abit at the moment with complete trust and was hoping for some advice? Thanks Heaps

He councils me, he makes me laugh, I make him laugh, he is there for me, when I’m down and I am also there for him. We got each other’s backs. He loves me like a friend and as do I. Now this is a 4 part question.      Question 1&2: A month ago, I ask “L” if he could be my father, because my real father left my mother during the birth of me and I don’t have a good relationship with my mother anymore, so is it wrong that I asked him to be my father? said he’ll think about it, do you think he should be my father?      Question 3&4: How do I be a good He enough son for him?

For example, in both my hands there exists a marriage line with a link to my Line of Fortune/Sun. And I have an almost straight Line of Fate.

I need help with this girl who knows I like her and I know she likes me, and everyone else knows we like each other, but here comes the problem   she just recently broke up with her "boyfriend" who is an 18 year old and he lives in Pennsylvania, and she and I live in Minnesota,and she is only 14 going to be 15 in June, and I'm 15 going to be 16 in July but whatever. so it was a long-distance relationship and everyone knows those usually don't work. so she is broken up with him because one of my close friends had broke them up......again.....everyone thought he was a complete asshole, and that is all i here about him, but when i asked her about him and why everyone hates him, she just said no one understood their relationship, and she said she knew he had made some past mistakes, and she said well who hasn't, and she said he was kind of a skirt chaser, which makes sense because i heard he had cheated on her multiple times, and even once asked if he could have sex with someone, and the weird thing is she never said he was good now, she just said he was "different" but not better. so she is broken up with him but I want to ask her out because I know and she knows and most everyone else knows that its what is right for us to be together, but the BIG problem is that I don't think she is over T.J., so what do I do,    I mean i feel like she needs space which I am giving her, but she is different from most girls, she is like a sensitive dude, she doesn't really say whats on her mind, she avoids questions when she knows that she feels is hurtful to think about, and she is slightly unpredictable in mood, but I don't care how she is I want to be with her, but I don't know whether to continue giving her space or confront her and giver her some necessary slight harsh push, she deserves better then this, she needs someone who will actually give a damn about what she feels, not some 18 year old who cheats an is a complete asshole and who isn't even in the same state,   so what should I do? please I need help, she needs help, she needs someone her life is crap, she needs someone who she can actually be with her and take care of her.    I need help

Me and my girlfriend broke up about 2 weeks ago and we have said to each other that we both still have feelings for each other.

We still talk everyday and hang out and it basically feels the same. So its basically we're just friends.  She often asks me if ive found "it" yet which is basically her way of asking do you wanna be with me again and i usually say "yea but i don't know if it'll work" or something to that degree and she usually says that she doesn't know .  She still does stuff that bothers me but now i can't get mad at it because we broke up like talking to my best friends alot.  But i can't bring it up with her because we don't go out anymore. What i'm trying to get at is, should i try to get back with her or get over her?    I know this is confusing but i would really appreciate the help.

My  boyfriend and I were together for about 8 months when things started going sour and eventually we broke up. Since then, we've had a couple of nasty fights but he always tells me that he still wants me around to see where things might go. "You never know", he says. Well lately, there has been a girl who he talks to and her and her friend have been talking a little bit of smack about me all over their myspace pages. I don't talk to these girls, I don't know them, but they say that my boyfriend is playing me. He's only been talking to them and has only known them a few months. He tells me that he cares about me and he's willing to work on things and change a little here and there to see if things might work out, but he still wants the freedom to talk to other girls. We're broken up, but should I care about these girls and what they say? Is it worth getting upset over? I'm unsure what to do or who to believe. Help!

20070616001951AAJYbzY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need Advice...?	So there is this guy I have known for almost ten years now..he was my highschool sweetheart and first love.  We have had on and off going communication through the years and other relationships as well.  I just got through a really bad relationship which he sometimes was there for me, a couple of months ago we started "seeing" each other and even though he is a STATE away we seem to enjoy talking everyday and seeing each other as often as posible.  He has stated we are just friends but yet it confuses me when he jokes trying to make me jealous and he sometimes seems concerned of who i will be out with.  There has been times that he tells me he cares of how I am feeling.  Is there a possibility he is interested in me as more than a friend, is the distance scaring him?

20081014171305AAS8LyP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm very confused. He said he loved me. But what did he mean by that? ?	    I've known this guy for about two years now, and in the past few weeks, we've talked a lot more than usual. Almost every day. I love him very deeply as a friend, but only until recently did I start to...um...fancy him. I told him how I felt about a month ago. Anyway...we've been friends for a while now, but last night we were talking, and he told me he loved me. I told him I loved him too. But...I'm not sure what kind of love he meant.    There's a few more things that complicate this: he's been hurt really badly before by someone else, he's bipolar (not severely, but he has a form of bipolar disorder), and I've never been IN love before. I don't know what love feels like. I don't know if this bond I have with him is love or not. All I know is that it's strong. We're also both rather young, 19.        I'm just trying to figure out if he said he loved me because he loves me as a friend, because he is in love, or if it had something to do with him being bipolar.      Sorry for this question being so long, but I'm very confused. Help me please.

She had an unplanned pregnancy at age 19, didn't want the baby, but your sibling and their spouse who were unable to have children offer to put her through college/university (she couldn't afford it) if she would give them the baby. She refused and had an abortion for the sole reason that she didn't want to not be able to drink and do drugs. If you had been good friends since Kindergarten, would you still remain friends with her? Just wondering what the majority of opinions are.

20081017053632AAtaWgN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't think he loves me anymore, what shall I do?	Me and my boyfriend have been together for over a year, but for such a short space of time we have been through alot! Such as we had to go through a long distance relationship of 4 months while he worked in France, he met a girl there, there has been alot of suspicion of him cheating, he has done many things to upset me and i sometimes feel like cant look at him. Though we both agree that everything has made us stronger but now we're breaking apart. There is so much history behind us and things we try and forget but its just not working anymore. I love him so much but everyone is saying i should finish with him, both our familes have noticed how distant we are now-a-days, my mum even admited that there doesnt seem to be love there anymore. I am really worried, we argue alot, dont see eachother that often and because of everything hes put me through i snap at him alot, i cant even take the little things he does anymore. I dont believe it when he says he loves me, and as horrible as it sounds when making love i worry hes imagining im someone else. He used to not be able to keep his hands off me, but now its like hes not interested anymore. I have many guys who i know like me, its not like i couldnt get a bf after him but i dont want anyone but him. How do i save us? Or has it jus fizzled out? Thanks.

20090220185700AAsRRsX	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	A Woman's Prayer........?	Before I lay me down to sleep, I pray for a man, who's not a creep, One who's handsome, smart and strong One who loves to listen long, One who thinks before he speaks, One who'll call, not wait for weeks. I pray he's gainfully employed, When I spend his cash, won't be annoyed. Pulls out my chair and opens my door, Massages my back and begs to do more. Oh! Send me a man who'll make love to my mind, Knows what to answer to "how big is my behind?" I pray that this man will love me to no end, And always be my very best friend.      Amen.

20090220183426AAy89lD	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	In your opinion of this situation, should I still CALL this GIRL?	I have known a girl from University since November. We have exchanged email and phone contact info. She was inviting me over to her place a few times each week. She would make me coffee. We would chill, talk, and watch movies. Oneday, she told me that she was divorced. The same night, she seemed to be quite emotionally attracted to me. We kissed on the lips, cuddled, and held hands in bed. During the night, she said “I’ve been looking for a boyfriend that can care for me.” The following week we were hanging out a few times. Next month I was quite busy with completing final essays. She gave me a text on Jan/25th saying “You like my baby boy” along with a picture of her and a her baby boy. It’s a child from her previous marriage. Anyways, I still respect her and still feel the need to talk with her. I am still willing to chill with her but still feel confused about the whole situation..
20090220182031AAaKDP6	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Can the state force me to establish paternity if I'm not on public assistance?	My story: I filed with the state 2 weeks ago to establish paternity with my child's father, who was not cooperating with me. As soon as he got notification he decided to comply with my request so we set up DNA testing privately. Once we did this, I contacted my state Child Support Services office and asked them to close the case, however they will not. They state that it is not my case vs. the father, but State of WY vs. father, and say I can close the case once paternity is established. However, on their website it states that all I have to do to close the case is to put it in writing (which I did) as long as I don't receive public assistance (which I don't). Will the father signing the Paternity Affidavit stop state proceedings?      Also, the father and I live in different states. Can I just notify his state that I no longer wish to pursue paternity testing?

20090220184254AACT9pH	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do I get my boyfriend to do something he doesn't want to do?	I'm in a relationship with a guy who lives with me.  I feel like he is dominating me and I don't even realise it.  How can I get a hold of myself and get the respect I want without hurting him (i have a very outgoing personality and I'm always afraid I'm going to hurt one of the closest people in my life) and have my own life and get him to listen to the things I ask of him?  He has been acting more lately like he doesn't want to help out or honestly love me.  But I think he's afraid that I'm trying to control his life because I don't want him to get a job yet (it's his third try getting through college) and he realy wants one.  He has threatened to move out of our place to his parents, which I said I want him to stay with me..  then he flipped again days later and i told him okay if you want to and he freaked out and threw a fit and said he would but he never did.  He's very emotional and I don't know how to deal with it.  He grew up in a basement big enough for him to live in alone, it has a fridge a big bathroom and a couch and t.v. in it.  it makes me wonder if he's spent a lot of his childhood alone.  How do I deal with it or learn with him how to treat eachother respectfully?  Is it possible or should I just give up on him??

20090220185235AAQNOlE	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is she really an actual best friend?	I have a situation and tell me if you think my "best friend", Emma, should change her attitude or if I should change mine. So, today during lunch, instead of sitting with my best friend and our group, I sat with my other really good friend, Shelby, because it was her birthday. Then, Emma got mad at me because I didn't sit with her. I didn't think that was fair, because Emma and always brings herr friends over to our table and we move over just for their sake. After school, on the bus, Emma rode home with this other girl. I overheard them talking about visiting my other friend, Kearstein, because she had just gotten dangerously dehydorated. So, I thought, "Yay! Now we can all go to her house together and see how she's doing." That was until later that day, when my friend, Josie, was over at my house. Josie had gotten a text from Emma asking her if she wanted to go to Kearstein's house. I waited all night for Emma to call me to see if I wanted to go, but she never did. So, I figured, that she's actually mad at me. I kept texting her and asking her why she was mad and I even threatened to leave our group if that's what she wanted. And her reply said, "Wow, man, i was kidding when I was being mad at you." I don't want to sound mean and say that I'm not mad about that. I don't know what to do now. HELP!!!!!!! (Oh, and tell me whose side you're on)

I'm in college now and most of those good friends dont go to the school I do. People say its easy to make new friends in college (im not in a university) but in all of my classes we just walk in, take a seat, listen to the lecture, and leave. In my English class I say "whats up" and talk to this guy about the class. I'd like to become closer friends with him, possible hang out outside of school. I'm not depressed or anything but I would really like to have more friends because when I have nothing to do at school (like if I'm waiting for a class to start) I do feel kinda lonely. I met just about 2 new people. How do I start getting closer to them or possibly make new friends when most of my classes dont really allow us to socialize much?

However I think lies hurt more and for longer, they also leave you less able to trust the person who lied.      What do you think?
20090220180842AA2Bc40	Family & Relationships;Family	Do anyone here have messy/sloppy(pigs) in-laws that don't clean behind themselves?	My in-laws barely keep there homes cleaned. My mother-in-law have dogs that crap and piss all around the house, even on her bed. She is too freakin lazy to train them. When they come around my house they let the kids do whatever they want to do. They just throw there ish on the floor. When we invite them for dinner, they never even offer to help me clean up or anything. They just ask over and over when the food is going to be done, eat and sit their plate on the table. They have so many of those little food nats in their home. I can go on and on.

I NEED ANSWERS ASAP before its too late
20090220180150AAos4kf	Family & Relationships;Family	What can or should i do about my sister and i not talking?	well we're not little kids anymore even though i feel we both are acting like it. but my older sister and i haven't talked for about 10 months, because we got into a huge fight about a bill. my father was telling me that my older sister didn't give him any money for anything, and well my older sister would just pretty much raise the electricity bill bye leaving all the lights on everywhere and my father wouldn't tell her anything because she is very confrontational, which would make me mad but anyways the fight came about the pg&e bill that was some 300 and something dollars,and i got mad and told my dad i wasn't going to pay until my sister gave him alteast 1/3 of that. she heard, got extremely mad went to me and just started yelling at the top of her lungs that why do i care what she pays when as far as i knew she didnt pay anything. but she saying that it was none of my business what she pays and sense she didnt leave we faught and well she ended saying really hurtful things to me so i left my dads. then i thought my sister would have to pay but she didnt and then left my dad two months later. but she is still mad at me for judging her then i heard she said more things that she thought of, im mad at her for not acting mature like an older sister and for the hurtful things she said like for the fact that im judging her about her life style she hopes my child dies before mocking them for how they are going to look. its been a while i would talk to her if she would only apologise and say yeah i did pay my dad but u didn't need to know how much whatever, but im not sure i should we have really never gotten along but i have a small family and i only have two sisters she's the oldest im the middle. I just dont know if i should be the first one to try and talk to her because she's evil im not kidding she would probably laugh or ignore me thats the worst. so im confused if i should try and talk to her or just leave alone sense we haven't talked already for almost a year.

But there is this one girl in my class who I instantly judge and I find it weird. For some reason, I don't like her because she seems boring, normal, doesn't want to be weird, is not athletic at all, and is popular with guys somehow. I don't know why, but this girl bugs me really bad...I don't want to judge her! I give everyone a fair chance, but for some reason this girl annoys me. I never spoke to her or anything...What is wrong with me?

20090220182724AAYUU8Z	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would you do if your Significan Other NEVER wanted to have a baby - but you were so in love?	My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. In the beginning of our relationship he asked me alot of questions about whether or not I wanted children, I was young at the time and said, "well yes of course." Several months later he told me that he had had a vasectomy after his daughter was born (she is 5 now and he was married before) but that he would consider having one more child. A year later he told me that he didn't think that another baby was something he wanted. (Did he lie to get me where he wanted me or did he really have a change of heart ~ I don't know.) By that time I was head over heels at the time and didn't stress over the issue - I figured he would change his mind or that he might not even be the man I married anyway. Here we are 3 years into a relationship and I am totally in love with this man and couldn't imagine my life without him or with anyone else. He still stands firm on the baby issue and is talking about marriage and buying a house now. I am freaked out! Yes, I love his daughter like she is mine but she obviously isn't. I am happy now but what if I am not years down the road? What if we split (although we are so in love) over this issue and I still can't have a child for some reason? Then I would have obviously made a huge mistake. I recently found out I might have some health issues with pregnancy as well. As you can see, it isn't black or white its a very very grey issue. I feel like I soon have to make a huge decision on an issue because time is running out and we are talking about the next step in our relationship. I sometimes feel like if I made him choose (which is mean and I wouldn't) that he would choose the not having a baby and losing me over having a baby and having me. Think about all the issues here with an open mind and tell me what you would do? I would love to hear if you have been in similar circumstances?

Hi all,         I am having a very different life after i transfered to another college where i am still studying now. My whole world become so empty. i used to have a number of very good friends and enjoying school life. Now, it is totally a different story. the new college i entered, most of the students are 1 year younger than me. I dont have any friend in class as My class only has 3 girls. the rest of the guys seem to be having grudge against me. Most of the time, i m alone. Yes, it is lonely.         I admit that i am just suck. I am the head of a club in my school. I wanna be a leader who everybody love. In the end, my club can't get things done properly, cant meet the teacher expectation. Then i am told that a leader cant please anyone. I promise to change myself to be more decisive and commanding. Yesterday, i was shouted by my assistant in front of the whole mass. after the whole programme ended, i was the one being shouted then being rebuked by the teacher.  I didnt know ppl ard me cant get along working with me until my teacher told me. the teacher say that i m a proud leader who doesnt listen to opinions. I m trying hard to prove them that i am not a weak leader. yet, they say that i m vry assertive in a wrong way. do i deserve to be a leader? I m just suck.        I want to be friendly and i can have more friends and less enemies. I take people comments in heart and i wanna improve my flaws in anyways. it is HARD to change myself and let other ppl KNOWING that i changed is even HARDER.        Complicated life

Me and my husband is 5 years married already.But we always have an argument everytime I am telling him about no food,no milk for the kids,no diapers and everything.I dont have a job he is the only one who has a job.I have a degree but I cant work coz my kids are too young for me to leave them to work.I am tired of asking him money.If I will gonna ask him to give me money,he will going to give me $20 is the maximum.Although I have $200 every month but its not enough for our needs.He doesnt even care about his kids needs...My husband is so greedy and selfish aswell.I feel starving coz we only go to shopping just once a month and we spend like $150 including food and our needs for our house.We dont have a car either thats why I need to catch the taxi going to wherever I am going to for example if I have an appointment.I cant go to shopping aswell coz everytime we went to shopping for groceries he will always going with me.And how i will gonna go to shopping with no money,of course he will gonna go with me coz he has the money.I dont even know how much he is getting from his pay.He has some insurance but his primary benefeciary is his dad.. me, and his kids are second and third benefeciary.Everything in the house is his choice...i am just a follower..kids clothes and my clothes and my shoes he is choosing it for me.If i want something that i like he will gonna say no.I feel like I am not his wife.One time also he told me that I am stealing his money.How come he will gonna say that?One time,I told him that I am going to handle his money,he just said "no way I am not going to give to you my money".He is also mean to me.I am thinking to leave him but how I am for other country and no money also for the airline ticket and beside he is keeping our passport.I really need to get away from him.
20090220191623AA6ijQF	Family & Relationships;Family	Could my Ex have molested his daughter?	At 9 years old my ex's daughter was diagnosed with an STD and she had scarring.  I called CPS that night and the police showed up at our home.  The ex was furious with me.  I talked to my mom about his reaction and she thought that maybe he might have done something to her. He blamed it on her mother's ex husband and in hindsight this guy was not even in the picture at the time.  I told him that she needed counseling and nothing happened after that.  The police never investigated any further.  I was only 23 at the time and didn't know what else to do....life continued and we split up a few years later.  So, 10 years after the split I called to check in on the kids and their dad told me that his daughter had been molested at 16 by a friend's father and my heart sank.....he continued the story and told me that he had gotten a tattoo in memory of that time because he was on his way to kill the guy and his daughter begged him not to....so he didn't.  About a year after that, his son and I were talking and he said that he thought is dad had done bad things to his sister and I also found out that his dad had told his sister that it was her fault that she was molested because of the way she acted.....A TOTALLY different story than he told me.  She also slept in his bed before and after our relationship but he told her when she became a 'woman' that she could no longer sleep with him because she got her period....The son confronted his dad and there was never an acknowledgement or denial.  The daughter and dad's relationship is abnormal....she is codependant on him and insists on being the woman in his life....Am I insane or does this sound suspicous?

Since we moved here (Canada) and away from my mother in law, we hadn't left our son with anybody... and when our #2 was born we only left him with my sister... for a few hours and ONLY because I was in labour... well since we moved here my husband and I have not had one, not one date together because we dont trust anybody but his mother to take care of them (not even my mother).  I am a sahm, and once in a while my husband will come home early from work and take the kids and I can go out by myself... well recently I have become more and more afraid to leave them with him.  Its not like he'll hurt them or abuse them... but it bothers me that I leave dinner done and ready to eat and he doesnt have tha patience to feed them... or other times I dont leave food he will give them pizza pockets ALL DAY!!! and that bothers me to heck!! also when I take showers while he is here, I trust he will watch them and he sits on the computer with headphones on and watches a movie!!! My brother in law the other day walked in the house and tapped his shoulder to get his attention (while i was in the shower) because he had the headphones on!!   I'm so annoyed at him.

My friend is moving across the country about 2,000 miles away and she asked me, "Should I say goodbye to my ex, although we hate each other?"      I said no because he was a backstabber, liar, hypocrite, selfish, rude, disrespectful, and fake. He was also a horrible jerk. She broke up with him about a year ago and she really hates him and she doesn't know rather to say goodbye or not. And he doesn't speak to her at all, although they do go to the same school and he used to stalk her, threaten her and taunt her.      So, should she say goodbye to her ex although she really hates him?

20090220201639AAUvNWy	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How to support someone trying to quit?	My boyfriend and I are expecting a baby in May, and he is in the process of quitting smoking marijuana.  I realize that not all people get addicted, but this is a case in which he did, and he can recognize and is working on quitting.  I am willing to do whatever it takes to support him, but I am having a few problems.      When he has gone an especially long time without smoking, he becomes verbally angry and starts talking about how horrible and awful I am.  He tells me he never wants to see me again (and seeing as I'm pregnant and hormonal, this upsets me).  Then, he changes his story a day or two later.  He has decreased his use significantly, but is still smoking daily or every other day.       My question is this:  Has anyone been through anything like this before? If so, how do you cope with the mood swings?  Do I believe him when he tells me he can't stand me or when he tells me he loves me?  I know it's hard to know in a specific case, but how have your experiences panned out?

20090220195852AAlsnTu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do? Seriously need advice! [kinda long]?	So, I recently had a daughter who is now 1 week old. I also have a 3-year-old daughter. The father of my 3-year-old is not involved, but the father of my one-week-old is. Now, here's my problem. My current bf lives in Washington. I hate it here where I live, my family treats me like crap, and all my friends have kids as well, so I'm not very social anymore. basically, there is nothing left for me here except my girls. I really want to move to Washington, but I don't want to take my girls away from their family. I can't stand it here, or anyone here either. The only reason I would stay is cause of them having their family. Having a babysitter as an option is nice too. If I go to Washington, I could focus on going to school, on top of being with the man I love. I wouldn't have any friends right away though, nor a babysitter ever! My girls wouldn't have anyone but me until i could get them into daycare. If I stay here i'll be depressed and lonely, and just work all the time. I don't know what to do here. I really need some non-biased advice. I want to do what's best for me and my children. So, in a nutshell it's, stay here and be miserable but, my girls would have their friends and family. Or go to Washington and be happy and start all over, but have nobody for any of us the first few months there. In WA I would be financially stable and would basically work just for something to do, or pay for daycare so my girls could make friends. My one-week-old daughter's dad is putting up a real stink, but he will only see her twice a week as we brokeup when i was 5months along, and it was messy. He began dating a 16-year-old 2 days after we broke up. Well, she was 15 and turned 16 about a month after. So, I kinda hate the jerk and don't wanna give him the pleasure of staying here so he can see his daughter but, she does need her daddy and I'm not gonna punish her or rob her cause of my resentments. Please help me, what should I do?

I know this is a funny question but I do not wear dresses at all and the last time I remember wearing one was in school. I have no clue what my size is but I know the kind of design I want. If I take pictures will it help them pick out a dress for me? Do they have to be in the room with me? I feel uncomfortable with that. What about under garments anything special? I usually wear a sports bra and well you know. So if I wear the usual will that be ok? I am lost and just want advice from any ladies who have went through this or are going through this. Thanks a lot to everyone.
20090220200018AA36khS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I tell him? Child support!?	I just got my child support order in the mail. Our children are 8 and 10 so it has been "a long time coming"! As of this month he is  behind over 5500.00 The order explains everything we are to do. That he is supposed to pay the money to the state of Ohio and they will forward it to me.  BUT he brought over some money yesterday. In the state of Ohio any monies paid, that DO NOT go through child support are considered a gift and he still owes the monthly amount ordered by the courts to child support. I dont think he read the order should I tell him?

I went on a date with this really nice but nerdy guy, and it was really boring. I told my friends, and they both went up to him and told him that I didn't like the date. They even went separately! My plan was to go on one more date with him and see if it still sucked. If it did, I would break up with him (nicely) or something. I never told them to, and they did anyway! Now I'm really embarrassed, and feel really bad for the guy, because I imagine he feels weird... ahh! What should I do!

20090220195317AAzuvn0	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think he may become abusive?	I have been with my love for a while now and I am deeply in love with him. He will surprise me with sweet things like flowers take me to dinners and movies (I as well make plans for us at take him out to do fun things, we have taken trips and just have fun as a couple) you would say "Wow nice man" yes he is when he wants to be BUT, we have been arguing more and more as of late and it used to be that when he was wrong he would admit it freely. The last 3 months have been horrible, the way our fights turn out is that I am wrong and he is right (well he feels he is). He gets very loud, shakes and just gets very angry at times. He has never ever hit me EVER or laid a hand on me. However he has hit the wall and has punched the bedpost so hard his hand still hurts from time to time. He is Marine Combat Recon Force Instructor and has seen a lot of action in his days, as he has students to train and maybe that is why seems to have the issues with being right all the time. When we do have issues we start out by putting them on the table but it escalates very fast into a fight and he will not let me get a word in edgewise. I have to ask him over and over to let me talk. We do live together and it is just getting to the point that I am not sure if I want to marry him. Yes its great when its great and we do try to work on it we talked about counseling and we need it but honestly have you ever felt your heart is not in it as much anymore. Have any of you ever been there. If so, please help me out I really wanna find the spark, but not sure my heart says stay.
20090220192318AAqtKfA	Family & Relationships;Friends	How should i react when people make fun of my chest?	OKay, I am 14 and really flat. I barely fit an A cup bra and like 5 of my friends told me, excitedly, this year that they just moved up a cup size.   One of my friends, she's a B cup, but she is going to be HUGE when she's older because her sister has them and her moms were so big she had to get a reduction.   Anyway, her and all my other friends say like "Mary,why do you wear a bra, you don't need it?" or "Guys will like me because I have big boobs." Or you know, something along those lines. they just simply make jokes about it.   I am really insecure about it more and more but I really don't want to show it.      My MAIN question is: What should I say when they say that stuff to make them stop? Should I say that's just the way God made me? Or that I will grow eventually and not now? Because My sister is like I THINK an A or a B. (she has both sizes) and my mom is i think an A. I just want to say a simple, not mean, phrase so they will think you know, like "wow she's right or something"   But since I am going in high school, I don't want the other stuck-up girls I know to say stuff about my boobs, because I know they do because some other girl I know is like me....but bigger. :(

I went out with my current boyfriend for 4 months and then we broke up. Within those 4 months he told he loved me. we were broken up for a year. he asked me back out a few of days ago because he still likes me. i really like him. The only thing is that i was his first girlfriend, and yet, after a year, he came back to me, without trying any other girls. we are juniors in highschool. BUT, i know i have to talk to him about what he feels, but first can you tell me how i can tell if he is actually into me, or just doing it as a game of some sort? He is the hardest person to read.. even his friends tell me that he is so complicated to know exactly what he is thinking. He barely talks to me, and most the time i have to say something first. I feel like he doesnt think i am here for him. maybe its because ive been his only girlfriend and he doesnt know how to act.    What do you think he is doing asking me out a year after we broke up(and in that year we never spoke, only saw eachother in classes or in between classes). are there any signs to know if he really is into me or not?

I want to move in other with a friend or a roommate out of the state because this is all I can afford.    I once almost moved in with a friend, but once I left they called him non stop, reported him to the police (for what I am still unsure since absolutely NOTHING illegal happened) and were about to get plane tickets to come down and try to get me. They have also physically restrained me from trying to walk out the door. I have been told numerous times to get an order of protection against my parents, but I am positive they will violate it.

20090220203328AA841iN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Drama! Honest opinions please.. thanks!?	BACKGROUND INFO:My boyfriend and I are in a serious relationship and we are both in our 20s. We are both currently working on our Masters Degee. =) We are in an interracial relationship.       DILEMA: A few months ago at a gathering where I was not present, my boyfriend's friends asked him about me. My boyfriend being an honest person and very proud of our relationship  decided to share with them a little bit about me. Since we are in an interracial relationship, my bf decided to tell them a few minor details about my personal life like my religion. Now, the people who he is telling this to are great, however some of them had a different upbringing than others...Particularly my bf's best friend's girlfriend "A". She grew up in a small town where she never saw a person of colour or have never seen a homosexual couple kissing. Given the information about my religion (I'm Muslim)... she took it upon herself to notify her best friend, (who just so happens to be CRAZY about my boyfriend) about my religion. Now I'm not sure why it's so important to them, but here is what "A's" friend "J" had to say: "He's dating a Muslim girl...ewww...weird...why!?"        I'm not only hurt and mortified by this remark, but I'm also a bit upset with my bf for even mentioning my religion to some of these people because I feel that it is such an insignificant part of our relationship. He knows very well what "A" is like, yet he decided to talk about it. I'm sure he didn't realize what a complete turd she was, but still... I feel very uncomfortable that these remarks made by "J" unfolded infront of a group of people at a later time and quite honestly I feel as though that is the only thing my bf's friend's think everytime they see me now.       Please help me...I just don't know how to feel. I believe religion is a very private matter and I am a little disappointed in my bf for making my religion one of the first things that stands out about me. I'm angry and really hurt... What do I do?

20090220194521AAerYGw	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do about my friend's boyfriend?	Well, my friend Jamie has a boyfriend named Cody. I don't like him, and I think he's a creep, but I didn't say anything to her about it because I didn't want her to get mad at me. I have a reason not to trust him. Long story short, I had a little argument with her about something that he did (she told him about the guy I like when she promised not to, and I think that he told the guy. It could have been one of my other friends, but I'm pretty sure it was Cody that told him, because I saw him talking to the guy about 5 minutes later...) and when I asked her about it, she got really mad at me. She got really defensive, and said that she was "sick of people talking crap about Cody". We got over it, but I still don't trust Cody. They want me to sit with them at lunch and everything, but I don't want to be around Cody. I was planning on just avoiding them on Monday, but I don't know if I should just tell her how I feel. I'm afraid that either way she'll get mad at me. I don't want to lose my friend, but I don't want to have to be near Cody. What do I do? I need serious answers.

20090220191902AAR6rW8	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	BEST ANS 10 PTS! Would this idea work? Is it too cryptic, or do you think it'd be cute and grab his attention?	At my school, two weeks ago there was a once-off lesson where all the people taking Chinese were grouped together for a bit of fun. During that day, people paired up to make pinwheels out of straws. My friend and I were finding it a bit hard, so this guy offered to make it for us. He isn't usually in my Chinese class because I take the "Continuing" course and he takes the "Advanced" course. As I was incredibly amused by the pinwheel, he casually commented with a smile, saying I was a "xiao hai zi" (literal translation is "little child", in the sort of "haha, you're so adorably childish" meaning). In the end he gave me his pinwheel as well.      I didn't realise immediately, but I had developed a crush on him through our brief interactions. I haven't really had the chance to talk to him, especially as he's always around his friends and when he's in the hallway, he's always appearing to be hurrying towards some destination. Also, randomly rocking up to his group during recess or lunch and saying hi is a bit awkward, so I don't know what to do. He's an international Chinese student, by the way, so his English isn't too good (nevermind that, as I can speak fluent Mandarin).      Anyway, the international students have their own locker area, and I have a Thai friend who has a locker in that area. I want to give him a straw pinwheel (that I've made myself) and attach some sort of note with it. I don't know what it should say though. Also, if my friend and I figure out where his locker is, if I attach the pinwheel and the note to it, what would you anticipate his reaction to be? Do you think he'll be freaked out? Pleasantly surprised? Do you think he'd remember me from two weeks ago? I've seen him around briefly in the hallways and stuff, and I THINK he may have glanced at me, but would he remember me?      Basically:   1. What should the note say?   2. Do you think he'd remember me?   3. What would you think his reaction would be?      Thanks. Sorry for the length.      <3 XoXo <3   Yaivi      P.S. By the way, any good ways of finding ways to talk to him apart from the "accidentally" bumping into him trick?

20090220201320AA8l1S5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help!!! 16 Year Old Boy Advice!!!!?	I'm a 14 year old girl who has a bit of a problem...There was this 16 year old guy who said he liked me. Then that day he asked for my number, so I gave it to him. Then that day I was texting him and he asked me if I wanted to hang out that weekend. I told him I couldn't and maybe another time. He said okay and everything...blah blah blah. Then on Tuesday guess what I found out? That on Monday he got a girlfriend! I was so shocked by everything that on Friday I texted him asking him if he still liked me. Then he told me that I was cute. So I told him that I thought he was cute too. And he was really shocked by that. Then when we have class together he kinda flirts with me and stuff. We still text all the time, but he still has a girlfriend. It's been about a month since he's gotten a girlfriend and a month since he said he liked me. I really like him now, and before when he liked me, I really didn't like him at all. So, this week I'm planning to tell him that I like him. I'm thinking about writing a note that goes something like this:      Remember when you asked if I would ever like you? Well, I would. I like you. But everything kind of changed when you got a girlfriend.----         Just need to know your opinion on this whole situation!! And I wanted to know if the note was good or not. I want him to kind of question it a little bit. I want him to really think about it and what I've been through because the truth is I've never liked anyone as much as I like him. I might be only 14, but I've liked a lot of people in my life. haha. But he's probably the nicest guy I have ever met in my life. He sounds like a jerk just for doing that, but I don't think he even realizes what he did. He thought I would never like him, but I do.       Another thing to know is that I've never had a boyfriend or had my first kiss. And he obviously has.
20090220202655AAe5USO	Family & Relationships;Friends	What makes some people think they have the right to decide what's good for me, or get in my way?	All in the name of 'your best interests'?      My 20th birthday for example, I didn't want to be a 20 year old virgin, so I asked my friends to help me 'meet women' a few weeks beforehand, while holding the full details. They said sure, well 3 weeks later I still hadn't gotten laid, I decided, whatever. I got an $800 check from family and friends, who told me to have fun. Cashed it out, got my money. I hit the bars for one last attempt the day before my birthday. Well they came out had some fun. They c-blocked me with every woman my friend warned me could be 'easy'. Then to make matters worse, when I told them what I planned to do with the $500 I had left, they took it all! In my attempt to get it back I got arrested for assault. Managed to get out of it by telling them they took my money, 2 of my friends backed me up on it, so the cops let me go and ordered them to give the money back before they got charged with petty-theft. My friends argued about my 'immoral' intentions. The cops seemed cool about it though... Throwing 'This is Canada' back at them and stating 'it's legal here. It's also his body, his money, and his choice' which got me my money back. They even called me a cab and a phone number which he said 'gave a discount to cops'. Well my friends followed the cab and chained me down in the back of one of their trucks. And, well, let's just say I'm still a bitter 20 year old virgin. Thanks to the asinine actions of several people.      So I ask... What makes people think they have the right to decide what's good for me, or the right to get in my way, all in the name of my best interests?

20090220203309AA9bXBe	Family & Relationships;Friends	I really want to send a message out?	Im 28 years old, ever since my teens, i never felt good enough for girls. Although i get told i look good, girls say they like my hair and such, i just never buy it. I just never feel any girl would go for me, i admite i have low selfesteem. Tonight though, i drove by a prison, and i saw the inmates there, it really got to me. Some of those inmates are serving life. No chance of getting out, ever. After seeing that, it made me think, of how pathetic i am for feeling sorry for myself of all these years. Im so happy to have freedom and the chance to meet awsome girls, while there are men that will never get that chance. I know that there are girls that will give me a chance if im not so shy, i know i have to break out of it. The message i want to send... Don't take life for grantited, ( if i spelled it right,lol) Right now, there are people in prison that will never be out, be happy with freedom. I know that i will enjoy my freedom and i know i will meet awsome girls.

I love him very much and we have been talking about marriage for awhile now.  Recently he has become more serious about getting married; possibly within the next year.  My parents do not like him because they feel I have chosen him over my family.  I would like honest, appropriate opinions on whether or not we are ready to be married.

She's never had a serious boyfriend, and she had a guy that she really liked. He screwed her over, she met another guy, went on one not even a real date, and the next night had sex with him. She gave her virginity to a guy she knew for a day. I don't understand why, her brother feels she should have all the freedom in the world, but I feel like since she is living in our house she should have some kind of rules. I really don't think she's going down the right road, and i'm not sure how to put a stop to it.

20090220192650AAfuXIv	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I don't think my boyfriend  wants me around his 3 year old  daughter.  What should I do?	I'm in a 2 year relationship with my live in boyfriend.  When we met he was going through a divorce.  In the parenting plan, him and his ex agreed that their daughter would not do "overnights" at significant others homes.  His ex also stressed to him that the time he has with his daughter is ONLY for them and shouldn't include me.  Well now things have changed drastically.  We continue to live with each other and now have a baby of our own.  His daughter and ex-wife moved out of town (3 hrs. away) and he gets her every other weekend.  Because of the stipulation in the parenting plan he spends ALL his time with his daughter at his parents house. When his daughter is in town, we (our baby and me) only see him for a few hours a day and our only communication is via text messages.  Basically, he leaves Friday morning and returns Sunday evening.  This week he left Wednesday afternoon!  When he returns his daughter on Sunday he comes back to our apartment and picks back up where we left off.  I feel alone, embarrassed, and hurt.  He doesn't include us in family outings and he glorifies his daughter to all his friends and on his facebook page, while our daughter is left out.  When I bring up how much this bothers me he tells me that I am selfish and that I knew of his situation when I entered the relationship. He also stresses that he doesn't see his daughter very much.   Is this cause to end a relationship?  How will this affect our baby when she gets older?  Can the parenting plan be changed?  Am I being too selfish?

20090220192058AAyNOZE	Family & Relationships;Family	Can my husband take legal action since she deprived him of his parental rights?	We live in Ohio. My husband recieved a letter in the mail from Stark County saying a woman from his past (16 years ago) is claiming that he is the father of her 15 1/2 year old daughter. He says he knew nothing of this. He didn't even know that she was pregnant. Apparently, my husband and his girlfriend at the time had an argument ( he doesn't remember why) and she just picked up and moved to another state. She never told him she was pregnant. Now he gets served with this letter from child support. If the paternity test comes back as a DNA match for this child, is there any legal action he can take against the mother for depriving him of his parental rights to this child? Also, can she demand retro-child support if he knew nothing of this child? I understand that it is his word against her's and that it can be kind of a sticky situation, but it is a mess that should have never been created! If it is his daughter, he should have had the right to know 16 years ago.

My friend and I like to play the Question & Answers game over IM. (I know this sounds childish, but I don't really know what else to call it.)  He usually asks if I have any questions...and I usually say no, cuz I can't think of any good ones.  I don't know if anyone can really help, cuz we mostly talk about things from our past and things that happen at school...Sooo...Maybe this question is pointless, but I'm just curious as to what others think.

I am a mature responsible 18 year old who does not party, goes to college, has a job, has a car, and has money saved up. My parents do not understand that I am capable of making my own decisions and that I want more freedom, although they can clearly see that I am capable of paying my own tuition and books, and purchasing my own car. They are going to have a heart attack when I tell them I have already signed my one year lease for my apartment and have begun making payments on my rent towards the first three months. I don't want to hurt my parents or anything like that, but I just feel smothered by them and I need my own space. Any ideas on how to drop the bomb in the least painful manner?

I can talk to him about everything and we really get along. But when my moms home, dad is always about pleasing mom and completely ignores me. What is worse than that is that he will actually be really mean to me. And I don't like being around my mom because she selfish and doesn't care about me. So I'm stuck. I love spending time with dad but I like him to be happy, and he's happiest when he's with mom. Should I just leave him alone or should I learn to deal with the way he is around mom? Thanks a bunch. <333

20090220195225AAqJgCs	Family & Relationships;Family	Moving country/school?	Hey everyone! this is my first question (Be gentle! =D)    Okay, so, I'm 16 and attending at a school in england. this is my tenth school. My family and i have moved around a lot since i was born, and i've lived in pakistan, canada and england, the latter being where i've spent most of my life. In truth i've always been very unhappy in my schools. I'm pretty quiet and work quite hard. for the last 2 and a half years i've been going to a different school where i'm very happy, i have a close group of friends, i get to do extracirriculars and i'm doing pretty well in all my subjects.    My father very suddenly got a job offer in germany though, which he accepted. he's flying back and forth from now on, but he really wants us to move with him. My mother has a job here which she's not so willing to give up, but my parents are one of those weird couples who are still madly in love, lol, and i don't think she can stand to be away from him so much. My younger sister and i are both really happy where we are, but don't want to hold him back or split up the family. My dad's a great guy, and very hardworking, and he keeps emphasising that it's our choice and our education is a top priority. (if i go to Germany i might have to do an IB, which may be good, as i'm trying to do more Alevels than i'm allowed now anyway, but bad because i suck at spoken assesments and because i did intend to have a strong maths and science base and am unsure to what extent i can actually do this with the IB). I have also been detecting a little bit of coldness from my father recently, almost like he's angry i havn't 'chosen him' yet, though this could just be because he's nervous about the new job. i don't think i have much of a say either. if my mum decides to go, then i really have no choice.    In all truth i'm massively worried about everything. my parents and i usually get on quite well but nowdays we're not, which i think is both our faults. I keep trying to talk about it, but it always ends up in a sort of argument. I'm scared, though i keep telling myself both places are great, and i get a good education and meet nice people either way, i just have to try hard wherever i go, i'm terrified i'll make a bad decision, and everyone keeps asking me like i have to decide now. I've never even been to germany! I'm also really miserably and uncertain because all my friends are making their plans (we were alll going to go on this trip to uganda with the scool next summer) and i feel like i just can't connect, and like i should start pulling away from them all because it'll hurt so much when i have to leave. I've always been lousy at keeping freinds over long distance too. they all seem to move on with their lives, lives i should have been part of. I'm almost a little angry at my parents, though i guess i shouldn't be becuase my life is so unstable, and everytime i get comfortable anywhere it's like i get uprooted.   I know this is really long winded, and maybe sounds whiney, and if so, i'm sorry, but i just really wanted to get the opinion of anyone who could be bothered to read it through, because i'm feeling really unmotivated and anxious, and i keep having dreams where i'm failing tests or late, or breaking things... and in real life i'm not much better...my GCSE exams are coming soon and i just want to get myself together to get through them.    Sorry i ramble so much! i'm trying to be open to any suggestions, but please, if you havnt moved around loads, please don't tell me how easy it is or how lucky i am, because it's not like i get to go on a gorgeous world tour, it's more like i'm just stuffed into school after school.

20090220195519AARb2Et	Family & Relationships;Family	Why are younger siblings so annoying?	My little brother is 5 and he needs help!! He never shuts up and when your not looking he will do the meanest things 2 you. how do you prevent things like this?
20090220195627AAm0g84	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why dont I feel a connection with my friends anymore?	Okay, you know that feeling you share with someone who is really close to you, ie. your best friends? Okay, I remember feeling that, but it seems like now, I don't feel that. Before, I used to make friends instantly anf feel that connection with everyone because I was so witty and funny according to other people. I think I was too, or at least a lot more than I am now. Now I don't feel any connection with anyone really. What happened? I know it's partly due to me becoming withdrawn from people from having and Eating Disorder, which made me have things on my mind when I was talking to people and prevented me from really being "me" around people...but I'm over the eating disorder...so what's preventing me from just being me? Is it because I feel like my old friends have expectations of me that I have to live up to, or feel as if I'm being judged? What happens everyday to me is that I think about having difficulty being me around people (witty, fun) ...it's like I'm thinking of how bad I am around people when they're talking to me and then I feel bad for not knowing what to say. But, my wittiness came back a few days a ago full force, but it seems to have gone again? What happened to the witty me? What happened to my personality? I know it's still there...but how do I have it there all the time and not just come and go? Please answer any question you can.
20090220195719AAYJa2f	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What would you do if you could hear your neighbors having sex?	I live in a 2 story apartment complex.  We've lived here for about 4 months now.  We would hear our neighbors having sex only because of the bed squeaking.  But recently, they are moaning and screaming.  It's getting pretty annoying! Also, I have two little girls in the house and I don't want them listening to that.  The neighbors are a couple with no kids so they have sex at different times during the day sometimes early in the morning or early evening; almost every single day!!  I really want to hit the ceiling with a broom and see if they quiet down.  What would you do?
20090220195848AAB3oFh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he really into me or not?	So I'm totally confused. Theres this guy and we actually talk a lot, usually on IM or something, haha. But whenever we talk, we always have really deep conversations about interesting things. And this one time a girl at my school was being really mean to me and he made this stupid picture of her & sent it to me just to make me laugh. He always does things just to try to make me laugh. And he'll text me occasionally, and I'll text back, but the conversation will go like      him: yoyo ***** whatup? (he's kidding, being funny or whatever..haha)   me: hey! uhmm not much hbu?   him: nm   me: oic..fun   him: yea      but then thats it!? He always texts me, but then leaves dead end conversations I don't know what to do with?       My friend always says we'd be cute together, but I always tell her that we're just friends and stuff. But then she asked him about me & he said "Well it's just nice having someone to talk to about things and we have a lot in common" Is he just saying that like I am? I kind of do like him, but I really don't want to get my hopes up? What do you guys think?
20090220195940AAjc4Cy	Family & Relationships;Friends	I like him but she might too?	I really like this guy, lets call him jonathan.       I was sitting with my friend, lets call her Candace, and she said she thought he was kind of cute and I said he was a 31/2 out of 10. because he isn't really that cute except for his gorgeous eyes.   well, I started to talk to him a lot and I always catch him staring at me. then he was getting off the bus and my old crush passed by me and didn't even look at me then he walked by and smiled a toothy smile and didn't stop smiling until he got off the bus.       then the other day he practically backed me into a corner during science on a free day and he was only inches from my face and wouldn't move. then we were doing a project and we was the timer, and I was the recorder and he was really, really close to me and wouldn't move away.       SO obviously I have a crush on him.       but back to Candace.   I was telling her a dream that I had with him in it once and I was like, "I don't know, maybe my sub-concious is trying to tell me I like him" and she said, "it's cause I like him." but she likes someone else... so I don't know.       but I've fallen hard for this guy all of a sudden, I mean I KNOW it's not love, it's NEVER love when your a teenager. I just can't stop thinking about him, he's always in the front of my mind.       I want to tell Candace, because she's my best friend, I've already told my other friend Morgan. but I'm afraid she'll be mad at me...    what if she does get mad at me and starts getting all jealous and stuff.   but I don't want her to find out the hardway either.       HELP!!       xoxo
20090220200004AAD9aFB	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How would you feel about your partner away for a couple weeks @ a time?	Just a question to get everyones opinion.      Im in school right now to become a truck driver, i have alittle less then a month to finish, been preaproved for a job, the job training will keep me out 6-9 weeks. then ill come home for a week, then go back out 14-21 days back 3 or so then back out. typical truck driving routine. The company does offer local, but cant get it right away because the high demand, so i have to do 48 states for about 2+ months. .my fiance doesnt understand that i wanna do local, but its hard to get local right away as companys are firing and only really need long haul right now, she says she wants a family and family is together not separate. point is i have a 8 month old, havent worked since she was born, cant find a job here, i had an opportunity to get a job. would you stop the complaining about being separate and just suck it up for 6 months or so, that way youd have health insurance, dental, vision, and MONEY???  i wasnt doing anything and it was a problem, could be doing something but she cant handle not seeing me. ..

20090220201840AAFCanT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	The love of my life is back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!???????…	ok so when i was 14 (you have to realize i know this was wrong and i shouldnt have but this is how it went down....)   me and my friend met the most amazing guy EVER. jake.   we were all bestest friends for the longest time.    i liked jake a lot and he liked me so we started dating...the only thing was....he was 19 and a drug dealer..and got into other illegal activity...   but he was amazing. there was definitely some type of connection we shared. also i lost my v-card to him.   he got sent to jail for everthing he did.   so pretty much. it was like we broke up.   now two years later im at a new school and everyone there just kept on pestering me to get a facebook so i did. then jake found me and added me! i was shocked. turns out he went to the army to clear his record because it was either that or jail. what was weird though is that we thought about eachother like every single day. it was very strange. but also cool cause we never thought we would see eachother again.   in two months hes moving back where i live. im 16 now and hes 21 and he wants to get back together. (he didnt say that straight to me he told our friend)    i do love him...a lot.   but is this a bad time in my life.    but i am graduating a year and a half early.   but he is in the army. is the army hard to handle in relationships?   hes also a really really really really really good friend.    what should i try to say or do?????????

She is overall a very hyper person, very lovable, but she usually gets all sad, and she seems very attracted to "emo", she likes this "emo" thing very much. Lately, she has been cutting because she missed this boy she loves, this boy is much much more older than her, and she loves him very much, but she can't talk to him because ... well, they used to be a couple, until the police got involved somehow and the boyfriend got this contract thing, im not too clear, but now she is all sad and cuts herself because she is sad she cant talk to him, and she claims she loves him and how she had gotten him in trouble with the police, and she cuts herself. She has pictures of herself with the cuts on her wrists very visable and red up on Myspace, and has her Myspace layout with the words "emo" all around it, and it makes me scared when i see those cuts :(      What can i do?

This guy is somewhat flirtatious already (he will just flirt though, he's not a player type), but I still sometimes think he might like me. How do you know if a flirtatious guy likes you?          P.S. We've also been friends for a long time and he thinks I don't date.
20090220200917AAtsVxr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it normal to not care for your significant other when they have dissapointed you?	So, my significant other has been telling me to stop smoking weed for the longest time. One day, I finally realized I should stop, and it was all thanks to her. We promised each other neither of us will smoke (Which is kinda one-sided since she has never smoked before and is so against it). So I stopped, have been clean for weeks. Then she goes and smokes with her friends! She knew fully well it would sadden me but she did it. 6 hits and everything.       What the ****? Now, is it normal for me not to care as much for her? We are both in love with each other but now, I'm not so sure. Not only because she smoked but because of what it meant to me and such. :\      Lastly, is there any way I can overcome this feeling? She's told me she was sorry but tonight, she went to sleep over her stoner friends house. She's not a strong person. I really, really hope she says no. And what if she does it again?
20090220201840AApxSL3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get my significant other to get sexual with me?	So I've been with this girl for 2 years and I doooon't know. It's been weird now. She's abstinent and VERY prude (Lol!). I mean, she finds the penis gross and all of that junk. No pun intended. She says she wants to get married after medical school and she won't have sex until after she gets married. Medical school! You know how long that'll be? I love her a lot and I will be forced to wait if there's no other way but come on, is there anyway I can get her to sleep with me? I think we're very, VERY close. We have a strong bond so it's not like she'll be throwing away her virginity to just anybody.      Lastly, she said she only wants one kid so she told me she's only going to have sex with me once. Oh dear God ...

I found one that was in our price range, in the location we want it, and is perfect for our growing family.       I asked him about going and seeing it and he ignored me. I asked him again thinking he didnt hear me and he changed the subject, the turned around and started up the 360 like we weren't just having a conversation about our future. He does this to me all the time. When we discuss bills, our child, us buying a new home...anything. He always changes the subject like its something he doesn't want to talk about. He's 25 and it seems to me like his xbox and games are more important than anything else.       Im at the end of my rope with him. He doesnt seem to want to take any responsibility and when it comes to bills, he tells me he stopped and paid them on the way home and that I dont have to do it then I find out that he was lying and didnt actually pay the bills, he went and bought a bunch of video games and stuff. He's 25 years old...shouldn't he be a little more responsible by now?

20090220202256AAemFva	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I got over this hurt about him and move on?	I had been dating this guy for the past 2 and a half months and decided to end it. During that time we got pretty close. My reasoning for ending it is that I wasn't sure that it was the right time for us to be having any kind of dating relationship. He told me from the beginning that he is going through a divorce and is trying to uphold his business. Both of which were putting him under a lot of stress and that he's not ready to be emotionally involved. I became concerned when we were sleeping in the same bed together almost every night and nothing physical was happening and I never felt like he wanted to be affectionate. This was strange for me since I'm used guys being more aggressive. The other problem is that while I was contemplating ending things I went out with another guy for dinner, nothing happened but I figured it would be a way for me to see what else is out there before I decided anything. I never told him about this but did mention the next day that I wanted to keep things open to see other people. During our breakup conversation I slipped and told him about the other guy. He was livid!! He said he is upset that I didn't tell him before I went out with the other guy but after. Since then we have been fighting and he doesn't want to even talk about it! I apologized to him in an email and he txted back saying he accepted it but to not bring it up again. I am really regretting that I did this. Now that almost  3 weeks have passed since this I feel like if I had never gone out with that guy and had been more patient things could have worked. I just gave up trying to contact him the other day since we have just been going back and forth with this fighting. I want a second chance though. I told him I made a mistake but I don't know if he will forgive me. Im not going to sit around waiting but if I still would like to be with him. Do I stand a chance here? If so how should I go about this ?? Should I call him, drop by his house and talk in person??? He hasnt called or anything since last week.I txted again today apologizing but no response. I dont know if he'll ever want to talk to me again. I really just feel like I screwed this up. I haven't had alot of luck with guys and it just feels like such a long waiting game for the right one. I guess I just need to find a way to put this in my past.
20090220202254AAgAYvI	Family & Relationships;Friends	Are these girls assualting me? what should i do about it?	i live in some apts. and this girl who is in middle school, her grandfather lives right next door to me. one day i went outside to get my mail and her and her friend were yelling at me calling me a whore. so i said, "look i know we dont get along, but can you guys be a little mature about it" and they said "we are being mature, we just called you a whore" and they kept yelling at me, saying how nasty i was and how they puke everytime they think of me. so i said "at least my mom isnt a meth addict"      *her mother told my mother that she was a former meth addict, but we think she still is cuz she comes up to our door in the middle of the night saying really strange things.      once i said that they kept going off on me, so i went inside. the next day, the girl tripped me in the hall at school, and i turned around and i said "wtf b***h" and she came up to me and was like "b***h you wana go" and i said "no i just want you to leave me alone" and i just walked away. the next few days they called me and my mom until i threatened to charge them for telephonic harrasment charges, and they kepp pacing outside my apts. all day everyday after school, looking up into my windows. i tell them to leave, or to please stop bothering me, but they stay there glaring at my apts.       so now at school her and her friends call me names, and ask if "i wana go", and they sit outside my apt ALL day. they never touch me, but thay still say things to me. and ive just been ignoring it lately but its really disrupting in my life.       is "do you wana go" verbal assualt? are they assualting me? what should i do about this next?
20090220202330AAQuZ0l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend of over a year put that he's 'Single' on Facebook.?	I set up a facebook page recently, per my friend who lived overseas had requested of me. My boyfriend decided to set one up, too.    In the space where you say if you're 'single, married, in a relationship,' etc., he listed himself as 'single'.    When I asked him, very hurt and angry, why he did that, he gave excuses like 'well, i'm not married anymore," and "it's nobody's business".  I was very hurt by this. I know he's committed to me and he's over every night, so I was very confused as to why he did this.   He said, "I'm not going anywhere, I'm still with you.."   I haven't been speaking to him and am still feeling hurt by his nonchalance. For Valentine's day, I basically have to ask him to get me something. I wrote him a beautiful card and he never expresses how he feels to me. I know he's capable, he's written poetry before.   He was in a 10-year loveless marriage that ended 2 Septembers ago. He doesn't want to move in because he said if we fight, he'd feel 'trapped'. Should we break it off? He apologized for the facebook thing and changed it to say 'in a relationship'. But I still feel pained about it.  How do I forgive and forget?

There is this really beautiful woman that i used to be good friend with about 10 years ago, and then she moved away. I found her on Myspace a couple weeks back and i sent her an email asking how she's been doing. She read it, but never wrote back. I'm afraid that she does not remember me. She is someone who i would really like to get to know again. Thank you for any help you might have!

20090220203747AAnHxM3	Family & Relationships;Family	Family Issues. Oppinions needed!?	Alright. Let me start off by saying that this really isn't exactly a question, as much as a ways of venting, and to see what other people think. I'd appreciate no negative feedback, I'm already going through enough. Keep your negativity to yourself.      My Story   I'm 19 years old.. Had a pretty shitty life, but pretty much go by "What doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger". I'm a high school dropout, stupid I know, and recently jobless due to an injury sustained at work and BS drama that goes along with it. I had my heart broken a year ago, while I was dealing with being raped, and its taken me a long time to heal emotionally.   My mother and I have never really gotten along well, and I had to move back into her house after being raped. Before then, I lived alone, and loved every second of it. Really long story short, my Mother really does have issues, and sees a therapist for them. Her house is chaos, and we got into a huge fight two months ago over some stupid drama. I ended up moving in with my Godmother.    This really wasn't a huge change on my behalf, I've always bounced around from house to house since I was 14. (Remember.. I did say that my Mom was mental. And no.. Im not one of those childish immature hates their parents type of girls, either. Just trust me on this one) Anyway, I can only live at my Godmom's for months, if not weeks at a time. She eventually starts to take advantage of my over obsessive need to please, and has a boyfriend that has constantly bothered me for sex.. ever since I first started living there way back in the day. He's been known to touch freely, too. I attempted to tell my Godmom about this, but she didn't believe me, and it ended badly.    I've been living at my Godmothers up until today. Here's where the story really gets crappy.. My Godmother has been in the hospital for the last month and a half, and I've been taking care of her pervert boyfriend (hes wheelchair bound due to a stupid accident that he had in july) and his  mother. My days consist of nonstop cleaning, cooking, houserunning, errand running, etc. The house tends to get chaotic, especially since her boyfriend is just a miserable person in general. My Godmother gave me complete permission to use her car as a getaway whenever I felt the need, to save my sanity.    Her son, his fiance, and their three year old live in an apt in the basement. Longer story short, I recently started seeing her son's best friend. I really like him alot, and his house is my getaway once a week. I love the silence, peacefullness and relaxation of it all. Plus, I get to see him, which is always amazing.    I live with these people, and cater to them left and right. The only retribution I get is sarcasm, ungratefullness, and more messes. I didn't let it effect me that much though. I had the ability to see J. That's pretty much all I wanted. I'm pretty much told by everyone that I'm clearly being taken advantage of, even by my Godmother's son and fiance.    I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Adderall. I guess new found love(ish) combined with Adderall have really have taken an effect on me. I'm happy for once.. Until last night.    I spent my day on the computer at my Mom's. It was snowing the earlier part of the day, and my Godmothers b/f txt me to tell me not to drive. About four hours after the snow stopped, the roads were clear, and J called to invite me to his house, roughly 10 miles away. I said yes, excited because I havent seen him in over a week, and then called Tom (GMOMS BF) to tell him I was going to J's. Tom never really liked J, and has a pure hatred for him since I started seeing him. Im not sure if its because he's jelous, or because Im not around to cater to him, but he gets pissy when I want to go over there. Last nite was pretty much no different, except he pretty much screamed at me, saying the roads were too bad to drive. A crappy excuse none the less. I told him I'd try and find someone to ride me down there, and he rudely hung up on me. I immediatly called my Godmother and told her what happened. She told me I was stupid for asking his permission from the gecko, and to just go. So.. I went. The roads were dry, not in the least bit bad. I got there more than fine. Soon after I got there, however, J and I decided to go to a nearby store for cigs. He had been drinking and was a tad bit tipsy, so I drove. Long story short, we took a tad bit of a detour and ended up on a country road. I was driving slowly when I noticed some snow on the road, but we hit a sheet of black ice, spun, flipped over, flipped back, and then slammed into an embankment. J's jeep is pretty much totalled in the back. By some miracle, we weren't hurt at all. J got thrown in the backseat, but was scratchless. Pretty much the most traumatizing expirience of my life (second only to being raped), Ive been in a state of shock for the last twenty hours. I haven't been able to eat, and can't sleep. Im barely able to talk. When I left J's tod

20090203091810AAhbipa	Family & Relationships;Family	Accepting Daddy's Death?	My dad was electrocuted at work on Jan 8, and by Jan 10 at 2 a.m. he had died in the hospital. I was there when he was dying, holding his hands and crying hysterically.      It has been almost a month later and I am still in shock over his death. My dad was my best friend in the world, he was so positive, optimistic, always always smiling...even when he was in pain, hard working, energetic, sweet, caring, loving person I have ever met in my life. He was my little sunshine, with his cute bald head, and his cute little belly...and even though I am 19, I would still always give him hugs and lay on his lap like a little child.      Now that he is gone, and died so painfully, slowly, and unexpectedly, I am having an extremely difficult time accepting it and moving on. Any suggestions??? ( no religious answers please)

20090220213543AAyy6rn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think this guy even wants to be friends? (dated him before)?	I dated a guy last year and broke up with him because I didn't feel enough chemistry.      I still really like him though and wanted to be friends. The thing is I havent seen him for 3 months and he kept saying that we should catch up and i texted him a few times but he never could and the last time he didnt reply.      I spoke to him on msn recently and told him I've been down and he said he wanted to help me.      Anyway, I called him today just to say hi. He didnt answer because he was working then he replied asking me how I was going. I said good and was just seeing if you wanted to meet up sometime. He said he was seeing someone and was not sure when it was just a matter of finding the time.      He hasn't found the time to see me in 3 months. I just said 'It's ok it doesnt sound like you want to be friends so its fine.'      I'm really upset. He said he still wanted to be friends and i think its just the fact i told him i was depressed that he doesnt want to be friends anymore. I'm upset because when we broke up he said he definitely still wanted to be friends - and you can still be friends even if you're dating someone.      Anyway, i just dont understand. Its the fact that he said he wanted to be friends still - so of course I thought I'd see him still. I have been crying this afternoon blaming myself and thinking i screwed it up. I should never tell anyone i am feeling depressed because i think thats the reason he doesnt seem to want to know me anymore.      Any advice?

There is no way to contact him in person because we don't go to the same school anymore. I see him .. well people that look like him everywhere and its making the whole "getting over your crush" thing alot more difficult then i expected.. people say "if he likes you he would of said so" BUT i was always with my friends and every opportunity he did make an effort but i was joking around and didn't take it seriously.. i ignored him basically.. and this was when i did go to his school.       SO i have his number and i want to call him.. would it be weird if i called him? its his home phone.. sadly he does not have a face book or myspace so calling him is my only option. I also think he tried to contact me because i saw a car that looked like his in my driveway and he rang the doorbell.. i didn't answer cause i was nervous if it actually really turned out to be him.. he hasn't come by since.       but anyways should i call him and IF i do call him what should i say? what if he has a girlfriend or something?? im so nervous i know i have nothing to loose but.. i don't want him to be creeped out.. i guess i was always nervous he would be creeped out even in person lol but ya..       should i? its been a year since i seen him!! i dated this one guy but i kept thinking about him all the time!!      I did run into him recently and we locked eyes.. all the feelings came back to me and I know he felt the same way.. i did walk away though and i hope he didnt take it the wrong way.. it was just to painful to look at him.. hes perfect.

20090203092222AAo3y8q	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Feeling suffocated accidentally by GF and life?	I am one of those people who likes a lot his own space, but at the moment I go to university as i live off campus i am usually stuck there from about 10-6 most week days, I also work 25hrs every week (thursday friday Saturday and sunday usually), I see one best Friend on a monday night and my other on a tuesday. i also have a girlfriend who i have been going out with for nearly two years now, and a family who i think feel neglected so come and talk to me when no one else is there. Now I don't really have much time to myself, i tend to get a night after uni once every three weeks or so and i am going out of my mind!!! I know that the culprit is my GF. It is not her fault at all she tends to only see me decently for a couple of nights a week. but because of this she then wants to see me after my friends, and after my work because that's normally late and i have been awake for a long time i want to go to sleep, but then she gets angry at me because i want to settle down and watch a film in bed as i nod off rather than talk. she has also started phoning up whenever I see a friend past midnight getting moody wanting that they leave my house soon so that she can come around (as i am a student i live at home, its cheaper). I cant see my friends any less without actually not seeing them, i cant afford to not work and uni is uni, i cant not go until i finish the course.    any advice?

20090220213232AAC7soh	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Has anyone had a long distance relationship that actually worked?	Ok So I will try to consolidate this as much as possible. I met a guy 2 years ago on a cruise. We really clicked. At the time I had a boyfriend and even though we exchanged email addresses and phone numbers it was innocent. Well 2 years later after a failed relationship or 2 with him and my relationship ending we have kept in touch. Very frequently I might add even when things were going good in the relationships we had. We only live like a 2 hour drive away from each other, and now we are both single. He has told me several times he wants this to go farther. I am the one holding us back. My issue is that I have 3 kids and they have been through enough they really don't need anymore drama. After 2 years of corresponding with someone I have no reservations about him being around  my kids but I really am worried because you never really know. I am your typical over protective mom who will not let anyone but immediate family alone with her children. My point is that this guy I met 2 years ago but has never been around my kids may be THE ONE, but I'm afraid my kids may get hurt either physically or emotionally and I'm afraid to make this step. Would you? I can't spend much time without my babies simply because they are always with me so that is not an option. So  being alone with him is not much of an option. He is a single guy and never married or had kids but he says he has always wanted them.    Would you take that leap and see how things go or would you just move on?

20090203092651AAQcICb	Family & Relationships;Weddings	If someone gives you a cheap shower gift and no wedding gift- can you repay the favor when it's their wedding?	So Kate gave me a cheap shower gift with no thought attached to it just a random piece of crap.... and then didn't even bother to give me a gift or card or a note for my wedding.  Now she is talking about getting married... Can I do the same back to her?      Why or Why Not?   I don't care about being a better person......... Should I revenge gift?   I am thinking about giving her just a card (no money or gift) for her wedding.  And something under $20 for the shower.
20090220210045AABJUz7	Family & Relationships;Family	Please answer?!?! Foster parents...?!?!?	Ok, well, about three months ago, I met this guy, Nathaniel, and we've hung out a TON since then... Like, a LOT. He's very emotional and metro... a lot of people think he's gay because of some of his mannerisms and how he's into fashion, but he's straight. I think he's very emotional because of his past... he lost both of his parents at a young age... awful deaths, too... I won't get into that... he's been in foster care, and never had a stable home. He's moved from place to place. Anyways, he's one of those guys who's really into hugging and stuff. He almost ALWAYS is hugging me or has his arms around me or something. I like him as a lot more than just a friend, and I think he might like me back, but anyways... He was living with this really nice foster family... they were thinking of adopting him, but he just told me today that he heard them saying they might not adopt him after all... they can't afford another kid during these hard times, or whatever... But he's SUCH a nice person... one of the nicest people you'll ever meet... and he's a junior, and soon he won't be able to be legally adopted anymore. He's never had a regular family... he's lived with grandparents and foster families... I feel so bad for him, because he was SO excited that someone wanted to adopt him, and he loves the family... I can't imagine giving up someone like him... I mean, I know times are hard, but when I look at him when he's upset, I don't know how anyone could turn him away... I don't know what to do, or if there even IS anything I can do, other than be his friend... but is there anything I could do?! Please, please just help me... just give me opinions, advice... I don't know... just, please?

His daugther never wanted to speak to him for many years because he left her mom when she was 5 and her brother was 3.  (He didnt them for me) but I did know him back then.

20090220212830AASNTEA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How should I ask her out?	Hiya,   I am trying to figure this whole situation out. Here is how it goes;   I don't hang out with this girl outside of school. We used to be "friends" I guess, but we were never really too close. Lately though, after getting a class together, I decided that I really like her. However, I feel like she is flirting back with me, but am unsure if this is just a "friendly" type of flirt, like she wants to be friends, or a she likes me flirt.      She asked to be my Valentine (On Valentines day though and I am not sure if that is in a jokingly manner), she shared a seat with me, said I could sit with her when I needed a seat, was offended when I had got something wrong (but in a joking manner). (This is where I think it was flirtatious in a friend only matter) A week or so ago, I was talking to a friend, and she waved at me, making me look at her. I feel like she is looking at me during class, now and then, but I can't be confident because I can never really tell if she is actually looking at me or catch her in the act. When this girl gave me a hug, she asked another guy to give her a hug. (I was guessing jealousy on that part, which makes me think she likes me) But at the same time, she has given me no signs that she really likes me. I don't understand how exactly I can tell.       What does this sound like to you, a crush for her or just a friendly gesture? If it's a crush, how should I go about asking her out?

20090203094457AA2gdak	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Woman which jerks or nice guys?	There are only 2 types out there which do you want cuz its always the jerk that calls girls his b*tches and seems to always sleep with them. so which do you want? and why? Cuz i really have to know why girls dig jerks over guys      cuz i still cant understand why most girls have low morals. if girls keep doing this all guys will be are jerks, nice guys are tired of being last so they rather be jerks then to spend another night alone. other nice guys are get to the point where they give up altogether and die alone. For me im almost at that point and i hate calling girls my b*tches, girls deserve better then that. but if that what girls want to be called and lose their virginity instead of wait til marriage like nice guys do then whats the point of women saying they want nicce guys when they go for the jerks.      PS stop looking at a guy for his looks or heigth and look at him for who he is.

20090220210751AAyObFV	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can i be more social?	I'll try to keep it short:       - i'm an extremely shy girl.   This year it seems like guys have actually been coming up to me and introducing themselves and talking to me more.       -i've been hanging out with guys more and more,  but i'm never actually being myself.  When they first met me,  i just wanna be able to be the person i know i am.        -when i get all shy,  i'm serious and conversation is boring.  i wanna just be the person that i am from the start, which is usually a lot more expressive.        How can i be myself from the start and not care what other people think of me?         And what are good conversation starters? I don't mean like the weather i mean something interesting and maybe funny.  I'm a teenage, so something to make people laugh or whatever.  I wanna be able to talk to anyone and not have a boring conversation, but actually make it so the person wants to talk to me again.
20090220204509AAKEz8a	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I lied, what should I do?	my mom was a liar, my husband often bends the truth. I lied to him about money, I was putting it away where he couldnt spend it all like he always does. And now he cant trust me because I wasnt honest with him in the first place. He said he cant trust me with the kids and while they were crying, I wouldnt go to them. He said I just proved his point.  but he still left me with them while he took off. He hit me where it hurts the most because the kids are my life. If I've ever been good at anything it was  being a mother. He called me a liar and untrusting. The two things I never wanted to become, but the situations he put me in life just made me do these things. He is a great person who's loyal and respectful, according to him its ok for him to make mistakes, not me. I hate myself right now. I wish I could just disappear, but then my daughters would grow up with the same self esteem as me and I dont want that, so what do I do to make them stronger than I ever will be.
20090220210516AAUhrbx	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it just me or is my guy friend reacting a bit strangely to this guy asking me out?	He has been my best friend for 3 years. We talk about literally everything, except other guys. It bugs me because he tries to talk to me about his girlfriends, and even mentions them every so often. It bugs me as well. I like him, but I would really ever tell him that when he has a girlfriend. I got asked out a few days ago, and him being my best friend and the fact he is seeing someone, I told him about it. And he brushed it off like nothing and changed the subject. He acted as though it was whatever. This wouldn't be a big deal, except that he is the most curious and persistent boy ever. He has to know everything. So the fact he didn't ask details was ridiculously strange. I told a mutual friend (also a guy) about it, and his first question was "Who is he?! And how did it happen?!" I would assume this would be the NORMAL reaction. Was it just me or is my guy friend being strange?
20090220212627AAgpa1R	Family & Relationships;Family	Noisy in the bedroom......how to deal? Mature answers please!?	Ok so my husband, daughter and I have moved countries to make some money. We have moved in with my mum and her partner. Soon, my brother and his partner are coming too and we are all going to live together (to save money).      The problem is, my bro's girlfriend is really noisy when they do the lurve bumps. Past experience with being on holiday with them has taught me this. The first time, I thought it was funny......but then it just got down right annoying. Don't get me wrong either, I love this chick to pieces, she is the best thing that has ever happened to my bro, this is my only major problem with her.      The walls in this house aren't very sound proof, we will be in the room next to them and I just know its gunna drive me insane. I sorta think that if you live with other people, keep your love noises to a minimum....I wouldn't want to hear my mum and her partner going for it so I pay them the same respect.      We also have a six year old daughter and I don't want her to have to listen to it either........not ready to explain these things to her yet!      So now I wanna know how to deal with it - should I just wait til they get here and see if it happens? I am hoping that living with parents might make a difference to her - but what if it doesn't? Should I raise it straight away or wait til it happens? She doesn't get embarrassed about it, I think she gets a kick out of it.         BTW we are in our 30's.....serious answers only please! Thanks in advance for your help!
20090203095031AA4CsWC	Family & Relationships;Friends	All I want is to be like everyone else but I’m not fitting in. It’s complicated! ?	This is complicated and hard to explain but I'll try my best. I used to be shy and I never used to talk much, but about a year ago I woke up one day and decided to change. I am now a much more confident person and I can talk to anyone. HOWEVER my problem now is fitting in. I have been trying to get people to notice and show an interest me. I struggle to get involved with conversations. “The main thing that I’m worried about is that if I KNEW that I was doing everything exactly right, I’d know that it is entirely everyone else’s problem and I wouldn’t worry because it can only get better for me.    ? I am often around people that are not that interested in me. Do I try to get them interested in me? E.g. If the bell goes for lessons and everyone is hugging to say good bye. Do I A. Walk in without saying bye to anyone or, B. Go up and hug them even though they wouldn’t hug me. (Also should I try to talk to them even if they probably wouldn’t start a convocation with me)    ? My best friend SAM isn’t particularly loud, infact he switches off and he’s often oblivious to everything that goes on and he doesn’t Pratt around like everybody else. But despite this he fits in allot more and people will go up to him and talk.   ? I never know “what to say at the right time” because I either don’t know what people are talking about or, I’m afraid that I will say the wrong thing.   ? My so called “friends|” often take the p*** out of things that I say.   ? Whenever I go into town at the start if people are ignoring me it lowers my confidence for the rest of the day and I just think “What is the point of trying?”    ? On MSN for example people rarely want to talk to me. Should I talk to them instead of vice versa? –Should I force my company on people?   ? Lastly, When ever it is just me, a close friend, and another person. Whenever the other person talks he/she looks and directs it at my friend. One time it was me, Sam and this Girl I really fancied on a bus. I was sat next to her and Sam next to me. She didn’t look at me once.   I worry about not fitting in all the time. Especially when I’m going to school every week. It’s doing me head in! What can I do about the above problems?

20090220210651AAy7mUA	Family & Relationships;Friends	Hey i need help im having some bestguy friend issues?	Hey to everybody on yahoo answers i need some help. Ok last nite me and my friend went to this dance at a different school. The reason why we went to a dance at a different school is because we went to see one of are good guy friends that has just moved there. One time i went out with him as a joke and he said yes (i feel really really terrible for doing it) but im glad that he forgave me. When i told him about it he said that it was ok becuz he still was in love with this popular,pretty girl that he had been in love with since the beginning of the year. I always had a feeling that he liked me maybe but then i though no he likes this other girl theres no way he could have strong feelings for me. Well when we went to that dance last night it was really fun. He was really surprised to see us cuz we didnt tell him that we were coming so it was funny. We like sprang at him and gave him a big hug. Then we started dancing and i kinda noticed that he was staring at me. Then he told me and my friend that he had to admit we both looked super hot tonight. We were both surprised but we thought he was just joking around as usual! My friend started to say something to me silently and she said "he likes u" and i told her no he doesnt. Then he said he had to talk to my friend alone and then when they came back we kinda slow danced which was extremely awkward. But then i kinda got away and we all rocked out together!!! Then he told me he had to talk to me alone and so i went with him. He told me that he was in love with me everything and wanted a serious relationship with me. He said that he was so caught up with the other girl that he didnt realize that he was always in love with me all along. He said that he thought i was funny,amazing, and he said that i was the most beautiful and captivating girl he had ever seen which made me (blush) like crazy. The problem is i dont know what to do. I DONT know how i feel about him im just confused and i need ur help on what to do. I mean i love him as a friend and everything but i really i dont know if i like him like that. He said that he wanted me to think about it over the weekend and then im going to see him on sunday and let him know. I dont know what to do. Please help me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Thankyou!     p.s.  he kissed me on the cheek to and it was a bit weird.     Also sorry for how long it is. I Just really dont know what to do???

20090220213110AANoGP5	Family & Relationships;Friends	Freinds think its weird Sports are not my Thing?	Let me say it this way: I am definitely a nerd.      But that doesn't mean I don't like gym.      I definitely look forward to 2nd period everyday.      Im not overweight.      Its just that I don't EXCEL at any sport. Im not good and Im not bad.      Its not like I get picked last or just sit off to the side during games.      I just don't sign on for sports because, well, Im interested if different things.      Me and my friends engineered a whole city for the Future City competition in Colorado. I liked doing that more then basketball (which was going on at the time)      I could get on the tennis team if I wanted to. I just DONT. I feel theres more important interesting things to do.      Some of my other friends think that thats totally weird. Do you?      Please Note: I am not saying I could get on the team because I am arrogant. My friends tell me I have the lowest self esteem they have ever seen (which is another thing I don't like about sports: I don't like having any attention put on me).

20090220210859AAc4Ce7	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Does anybody else believe that the only reason young people as in early teens (13-17) don't have sex is...?	I honestly want to know this it is for my survey on society. If you don't like the question please just return to the home page. And please don't flag it.       Thank You!       Anyway, in my survey the question is do you believe the reason most people do not have sex at a young age is because our society does not accept it?      If you actually think about it our body's are made to have sex and make children once we have finished puberty. So why is it that most teens do not have sex. It is the way we where meant to be right?
20090220213912AABQYVv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i leave him or love him?	think i have a disorder, but i dont know.   it's pathetic of me, my ex..we had tons of fun with each other.    until i met his mom, and then he started treating me like his sister.   the B**** word and threating and hurtful things. but this didnt start happening until i moved away..when were together he's a man and kind   but he became cold hearted when i moved. sometimes he could take my breath away with love. and he would never say anything bad to my face in person.   But i knew deep down he was amazing, so i put up with it. It became a long distance relationship (my family moved, i had to move). he never spent a dime on me but gave me gifs like clothes and watches..i've spent over 500$ on him.   and well i lied to him about things i was going to give him, to make sure he'd never leave me, or get bored (long distance remember) well i did my best buying him stuff. but after a year and ahalf he broke up with me..but i still think about him, i left him over 100 messages..sent him a letter and just sent him 20$. He's my life, i miss him soo much, he's the sun in my eyes (he was madly in love with me...and deep down i think the fire is still burning, and hes just mad..that we never see eachother). we'll hes moved to the ghetto...and well i know life can be hard, but i love him and i think about him every night..and it isnt about making love..i have another guy thats my friend (that always wants to do that, i say no) it's just that i'm a nice person and would die for him..i think about him everyday. i want him back..but i dont know if he'll ever come back
20090220205106AAuirYz	Family & Relationships;Friends	Help please?!?! Bf's parents!?	Ok so me and my boyfriend have been going out for 6 months now and the 4 months of it has been hell! In the beginning his parents used to like me and always go out with me and everything but then they started to get really annoying saying that he gets bad grades and doesnt wanna do anything because of me.       His dad blocked his cell phone messages so that we couldnt text each other and stuff and he said that we could only talk until 9 pm. We had a whole talk his family and mine but it still didnt help,      the last time we all talked, his dad said that its over between me and him. We however still did not end it.. We love each other and dont want to lose each other..      The problem is his dad does everything to keep us from seeing each other and I cant stand it. He wants me to go to his house after everything he has done to me and he said that if I dont go there then my bf cant come to my house. So I went there yesterday until 6. Then his dad said he can only stay at my house until 6 from now on and that I have to go to his house..      What should I do? My bf is scared of his dad and he never really talks to him, his dad thinks hes the boss of everyone and he does whatever he wants..      I dont want to end the relationship I just need some advice on how to make them understand we will not break up and for them to be nicer..      Help me please!!!!

20090220204720AAn0tM3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	NO MINORS!!...FOR ADULT ONLY!!?	Do those female pornstars actually get married with someone who is NOT in the porn industry?  How do their husbands be able to accept their wives' professions?       I know most of the guys would fantasy about marrying to pornstars and think it would be awsome idea to have sex with pornstar wives everyday (I'M NOT MAKING A MORAL OR ETHICAL JUDGEMENT HERE, I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE MY POINT ACROSS....SO PLEASE, DO NOT MISUNDERSTAND MY STATEMENT).  But if you sit down for a moment and actually put some deep thought about it...Can you honestly be able to convince yourself that you'd actually be okay about it, knowing that there are countless guys keep pounding your wife...I mean if I were those husbands, I would have gone insane and be punching the wall everyday because I think jealousy is also part of love and if a man loves his wife enough, he would never want to share his wife's body to another man.      Please, once again, this is NOT meant to insult anyone in anyway.  If you're in that profession, I respect your own personal life choice.  I'm just trying to understand from a different point of view other than my own personal view.      and NO, this has nothing to do with me...hehe...lol

20090220205850AAXIzN4	Family & Relationships;Family	Growing up was your mother or father the bigger disciplinarian?	I think my mother was more of the disciplinarian.. however, it had more effect on me when my father disciplined me. I think this was becasue I was such a daddy's girl. It may of also been the way he disciplined. He very rarely ever did it, only three of four times in my life. He had a belt and it hurt!! The last time he used the belt was when I was nine I stole. I remember the talk he gave me and the dissapointed look in his face more than the whipping he gave me. The whipping hurt like crazy, but the dissapointment in his eyes was the big thing..    Who was the disciplinarian in your house? Who was more effective?

HELLO! they are suffering from a little thing called depression, not being emo. and if they label themselves that because they cut themselves then they are called "cutters"--------> emo is a type of music.... NOT  a lifestyle like she is treating it like. yes it may be short for emotional but it is also short for "emotional rock" or metal. so can u ppl on here please tell me if i am right or wrong here and what is the reason ppl would label themselves "emo"?

20090220210201AASn0Nt	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I deal with my INSANELY annoying stand partner?	I have orchestra class twice a day (1st and last classes of the day) and I have the same stand partner for both. I'm really not a hateful person...until I have to deal with this guy. There is literally no one on this planet more annoying than him, and I get to take the full brunt of the damage. And it's not just me - just about everyone other than his girlfriend would love to just beat his face in (lol, at least I get sympathy). It's not that he's not a nice guy, but it's time he finally took a hint. Now I might as well list a sample of the annoying crap he does:      -Thinks he's the funniest guy ever, even though 99% of the time, no one laughs and his jokes sound totally forced   -Comments on EVERYTHING, usually with his lame jokes   -Tries to talk to everyone as if he's best friends with them (esp. me, my orchestra teacher, and a few others)   -Always asks, "Whatsamatterwitchu?" whenever I ignore him   -Plays like crap, which screws up my playing   -Keeps playing (like crap, of course) when we're supposed to stop   -etc., etc.      Ignoring him doesn't help, since he just keeps going and tries to be all "HEY GUYS LOOK HOW FUNNY I AM" with the other people around us. The biggest problem is that next week I'm stuck with him for three hours a day for pit orchestra rehearsals, and I'm about to rip his throat out at this point.      How do I deal with him?

20090220210302AAxgfqb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Another try, or leave it as it is...?	Last weekend, my ex and I started talking again. He asked me out again, saying that he never stopped loving me...he just knew I was unhappy and wanted what was best for me. We're back together now and he's admitted that in the month or so since we broke up , he had a few crushes. But not like he likes me...apparently there's a huge difference. I think I trust him but he's always been really shady about his ex's and other girls. He doesn't seem as into me as he used to be. I know it's only been a week, but it didn't think we'd be going through the awkward new couple deal again. Do you think it was a good idea to go out with him again or should I end it now? BTW, we broke up over a fight we had about his ex. Do you think that'll still be an issue this time around?

20090220212738AAEfQJh	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is a week too long to go without seeing each other?	This guy and I started talking last Saturday....for the first time.  Monday we had our first date and Thursday was our second.  Today he asked me when we were going to hang out again and said he hopes it's not too long.  I said maybe sometime within this next week, maybe next Saturday.  He said he don't know if he can wait that long.  I said that I thought he was into taking it slow & he said that's like 8 days away.  I told him that sometimes when people get too attached too quickly it can mess things up & that I really don't want to mess anything up with us.  I also said that I feel like the more often I see him will probably make me want to see him even more and more.  He said he understands & doesn't want to mess it up either.  Is once a week enough to see each other?  We both work full time and I also have a kid.  So we work around our schedules too.  I just feel like I'm already getting attached to him, that's how much I like him already.  I can see myself being with him and falling hard and fast for him.  Does anyone have any input or advice on this?  If it helps with answering, I am divorced.

20090203091218AAkP8lX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it okay to be naked?	I was over my friends house last Holloween and she and her husband was getting ready to go to a party.  We were all in their bedroom when he came out of the shower and walked into the bedroom completely naked.  They seemed to play it off like it wasnt a big deal and he just stood there having a conversation with me all the time I kept finding myself sneaking peeks at his penis.  I didnt think much about it, but a few weeks ago when I was getting ready to go out with my gf at her house, he walked in while we were both completely naked.  My first reaction was to cover up, but I didnt want to be obvious so I just stayed naked.  Neither of them seem to mind about the nakedness.  Is this normal or does it seem strange?
20090203091529AAjNWHO	Family & Relationships;Family	How would you deal with this situation?	a little while ago I wrote a sons about this guy I had a crush on. This is quite usual for me because I write at least one song every day. I thought I had thrown it away but my mum must have been going through my stuff because she found it. She brought it up once and teased me about it and once when I was on msn she said, "I hope your not chatting to dean (his name)" and i replied like I didn't know what she was talking about but she said she would show me. My mum is like most other mother - embarrasing! and I am sooooo afraid that in the future she is going to bring it up again and show people the song and the song is quite cheesy!!!     Help !! what can I do to avoid her bringing it up again??????  I can't talk to her or bring it up myself because its too embarrasing.

20090203091735AAkEtJy	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can mother move out of Missouri if she has primary and physical custody?	My husband only has visitation rights with his 11 yr old daughter according to court he gets her every sunday and every other friday and saturday and gets her 2 weeks in june and july and one week in august and pays child support except for june july and august. So heres the deal back in 2004 we had her held in contempt for violating the visitation rights and she agreed to let my husband have her for 50% of the time and drop the child support if he dropped the comtempt charge, so he agreed, but now the state is going after him for child support and we believe the mother enforced it so now were stuck with a child support payment. We have learned the mother is moving but were not sure that it's out of state or not but she is going to school for a new career and she plans on going to texas for a week right after school lets out and she is also planning to move at the same  time and she told her daughter not to tell anybody that they were moving. So any advice we be appreciated cause we really need it my husband is a good father and he does get her 15 days out of the month.

20090203092328AAMbmBa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does it mean when a woman stops communicating with you?	I've been really good friends with this girl for a long time and recently we've been hanging out a lot. We've always talked about how we could be together sometime in the future. The thing is, she just got out of a lengthy relationship and I understand that she's not ready for anything serious. We spoke about her needing her space, and I'm alright with that. What I don't understand is, how can you go from talking to someone everyday and being close to just completely stop talking to them without any explanation. I'm just confused and looking for possible answers.

20090203092809AATt7nx	Family & Relationships;Family	My niece is in a horrible home?  She is small, quiet, very docile person.?	Her step-dad is an, in your face screamer, severe cusser and has put his hands on my niece twice in the last year. ( I just found out 7 days ago) Her mother  refuses to stand up for her kids. Takes their money for bills.  My nephew (19) joined the Army 7 months ago to get away from the abuse and mental anguish.     My question is this.  My niece is 18 in 3 weeks and a junior in high school.  She is terrified to stay at home with that a**. She wants to live the rest of her school career with me. Is there any way for her to leave that house and come back to my home, legally?   I am very distraught right now and so is she.  She has been at my house for 9 days at her mothers request b/c of the step dad. Now she is gone! Her mom and step dad made her go back today. We begged for her to stay but step dad, i'm sure, made mom bring her home.  Please, someone who might have been in this spot or know a law or 2 in California, any help would be greatly appreciated.       In addition, no one in her house can help with her homework so her grades are dropping. She has no privacy at all. Ppl go thru her belongings looking for money. She hasn't been to drivers ed. or training. Walks 3 miles to and from school, no food in the house, even though mom get $800 in food coupons. I think they are selling them for money. No lunch money at school.  She is just miserable.
20090203092820AAKIygN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS PLEASE HELP!! I saw him yesterday & he seemedd mad!?	So today i saw that guy Jeremy that i talked about in some of my other questions. When i was leaving the place I saw him at, his mom was like "Jeremy, come here. Did you say hi?" & then he looked at me & said "Hi". He wasn't smiling at all when he said it & he didn't sound happy either. Right after he said hi he just went back to talking to his friend. He only looked at me once. Does this mean he really doesn't like me? I still really like him even though we haven't talked in a while or seen each other! I don't know what to do! Could he have been embarrassed by his mom or was he trying to act cool in front of his friend? Could it have been weird for him just 'caus his mom was there? btw we liked each other once...but that was in elementary...

20090203093848AAqoaRA	Family & Relationships;Friends	I have a friend who is dating her "cousin"...?	It's not her cousin by blood, but only by marriage. They met when they were 6 years old and grew up as "cousins" because their moms both got remarried to their stepdads who happen to be brothers. Make sense? So all their lives they had a great connection and were always attached at the hip during family gatherings/vacations. Now they are both in their 20's now and have dated other people...but have realized that the feelings they had as kids never went away...they feel that they are soulmates. Is it weird for them date even though they are not related by blood? Both are stepchildren whose stepdads are brothers...opinion?  My opinion is that I just want her to be happy but she was wondering what other people thought...so I thought I'd post the question :-)
20090203093935AAd5iU7	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do your ever just feel like someone else is living your life?	Do your ever just feel like someone else is living your life?  I am 26, married and have the beautiful little girl I always wanted.  Yet, I feel very alone and depressed.  It's like I'm screaming for help and no one hears me. I've tried anti-depressants and therapy, but they don't seem to help.       My life consists of going to work, taking care of my daughter and husband, and taking online classes.  I feel like I'm not even me.       Sure I could go and do something but I never have anyone to go with or I have my daughter and can't. My husband no longer likes to do the things we used to do. My friends are single and would rather hang out with other single people.      I've tried making friends at church, but everyone there is old enough to be my great-grandparent. I've considered changing churches, but my husband has been there his whole life and wants to stay there.  It gotten to the point that I don't even go anymore.      I don't like hanging out with myself. It makes me feel stupid. I try new things (like arts and craft projects) but then I feel ridiculous when they don't turn out right.      It's like I'm watching my world move around me in slow motion and I'm not even in it. I tried talking to my best friend about it and the only "advice" she could give me is that I just need to be a happier person.  I wish it was that easy.      But that's the thing...I am happy, just not really.  What am I missing?
20090203094334AAon1e3	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I think my bf got issues. seriously?	last nite as soon as my bf got in my house he told me about some guy he saw running down stairs in my building, said the guy was buttoning his coat & that he looked "suspect". then he asked me, "the guy wasnt coming from YOUR HOUSE was he?"      was he serious? i refused to answer him. bcz why would he ask me that? i dont know that guy. there are 36-40 apts in my building. so he sees ONE GUY coming down some stairs buttoning his coat and automatically wonders if he's coming from MY HOUSE??? why?? he got angry bcz i wouldnt answer him & an argument started.       before he got to my house it was quiet, i was relaxed, watching a good movie. AS SOON AS HE GETS THERE, within 5 mins there's arguing, suspicion, tension, cursing, & i'm sitting there actually feeling like i DID SOMETHING WRONG when i didnt do a DAMN THING. my whole mood got messed up. he was angry enough to grab his stuff and LEAVE. i swear to God my bf makes me HATE HIM      WHAT WAS THE REASON FOR ALL OF THAT, what is WRONG with him???

20090203095117AAnlebH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband and our marriage...what to do?	My husband and I have been together for 10 years and been married for 5 years, and we have a child together.  The last 2 years have been very difficult and we ended up separating, and I have since moved to another state.      I do still love him, I never stopped, and during our separation I have come to realize that I really would like to work harder on our marriage.  We both have a lot of issues with trust and I have a lot of issues with questioning his commitment.  So recently we have been talking a lot, and he has told me that he still loves me and would like to try again to make our marriage work.  But the problem is during our separation, he started seeing someone and have slept with this woman.  After several long talks, he told me that his feelings for this woman is strictly friendship and that he only reached out to her after I moved out.  I understand that he was heart broken, as I was too.  And I don't blame him for reaching out to this woman.  But I am worried about him still seeing her if we do get back together, I say this because he is still very much talking to this woman now and sees her everyday (they work together).      Another thing is that, he tells me that he still loves me and misses me very much but doesn't act like it.  I know we are long distance now, but he hardly calls me.  I am the one that does all the contacting.  I do plan to move back to the same city, not necessarily with him right away as we want to work out on our marriage first.  But it seems that he isn't very interested at times.      Should I continue trying to work towards a reunion with us? Or do you think our marriage is over and should just work on a road to divorce?

20090220213459AAGk6r0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you stop liking a girl?	Fast...I have liked a girl for some 1.5 years now, and I don't know how well it would work for me to try to like another girl because I don't really find anyone else more attractive or fun to be around as her. At the same time, because she is so great she has been with many boys, and I have been with few girls, so even though sometimes I feel like I am being given opportunities by her, I know it wouldn't work out in the end. So I need to know how to stop liking her fast, what do you all recommend?...Also, I would love a way to do it...somewhat quickly.

20090220213641AAk9GEA	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I let my sister go and stick to my guns?	I have a 17 yr old sister that is very immature that I have been taking care of since 2005. She drags my asthmatic daughter with her in the COLD to see a boyfriend who wouldn't do the same for her. I work and go to school full time, and she watches her for money. She lets dishes just pile up for days and has a attitude when I point it out. She has now taken the cake when she has a mouth infection (the 4-6th one since braces..ive had braces and didn't have this problem) that has been brewing for the last week. I refuse to buy tylenol because she downed a bottle over a week and ended up with poisoning bc she never told me she was having pain. She has twice in two weeks just laid in bed and stomped around the house in pain. I took her to the hospital. They gave her motrin and the antibiotic. She came home and NEVER took the antibiotic. Today, I sent her to Children's hospital. She sat there for four hours and decided she tired of waiting, never checked with the nurses station to see if they may have skipped over her  and just came back home. WTF is wrong here??? She came home and after i had words with her for making a poor decision (the girl s breath smells awful because pus is coming from the infection)she took my daughter in the cold to her boyfriends house. Ok, so now we have a 17 yr that decided she was going to just lay in bed with an infection, go to the hospital and not be treated, wait til my daughter came home from school, and just go to her boyfriends house INSTEAD of going back to the hospital (the dentist is on vacation and the backup office is not on the bus line). I am just TIRED of the goofy decisions she makes that make absolutely no sense, she is clearly not ready for the real world because she cant even do basic things such as make sure her teeth and breath is clean.She thinks all she needs in a boyfriend; she wants to do adult things but cant even do basic things that a teenager should know how to do.We got into a heated argument bc she didnt go to school but thought it was ok to go to her boyfriends house today and the whole mouth infection thing and told her i'm cant wait for her to get out. She ran to her boyfriends house which allows her to stay the night. his parents arent wrapped too tight. I would never allow him to stay with us. I'm tired of her drama..should i just wash my hands? She's left before and came back after the money ran out or she wore out her welcome.    She gets this bright idea that the people that she stays with wants her to stay forever and rent free.

Sometimes I don't know why am i like this i mean i had my dad with me until i was 10 then my dad and mom separated but i still seen my dad somewhat not often..So i talked to a friend of mine shes 52 and she asked me if i have been abused and i said no im still a virgin no guy touched me and she asked me again and i said well there is this one guy who was 40 and i was 14 and he kissed me and i liked it he made me feel special when i always was teased in school and made me feel beautiful and gave me attention but i stopped seeing this man because my mom had me on lock down. Now i don't like guys my age only older and i feel more secure with a older guy is like i don't need to impress them as much as i do with a younger guy which i feel so overwhelmed. i was talking to this 30 year old man and i really liked him but everytime he would drink he would lash out on me and swear at me and somehow i would take it and if it was my sister she would end it there but i kept it going i even feel if i let this man hit me i would still went back and kept talking to him if he begged long enough..But he stopped talking to me because he says im immature so he stopped talking to me on the phone and kept it professional at work.      so will i be a abused women in the future in the making or what...How can i change this how can i get better..please help me

I love him, and he's a great boyfriend. He has some kind of girl friends, but not any good or close ones. More acquaintances. I don't mind at all; he's not a ladies man in the least. I asked him tonight how he's such a great boyfriend but he sucks with other girls. He said that with other girls he doesn't try, and that he doesn't need to. Definitely a good thing for me. Does anyone know any guys who are like this? I've just never heard anyone say something like that.

20090220214809AAWDg01	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	WHAT DO YOU THINK MY BOYFRIEND FEELS?	I went out with my current boyfriend for 4 months and then we broke up. Within those 4 months he told he loved me. our relationship was more intimate then verbal. we were broken up for a year. i am 16, he is 17. he asked me back out a few of days ago because he still likes me. He is the hardest person to read.. even his friends tell me that he is so complicated to know exactly what he is thinking. He barely talks to me, and most the time i have to say something first. maybe its because ive been his only girlfriend and he doesn't know how to act.    What do you think he is doing asking me out a year after we broke up(we haven't talked, only have some classes together).    GUYS, what do you think he is feeling?

I think she might not be getting the hint to since she is my friend. She may have figured it out by now... but either way, are there any tips since I can't be direct and I don't know what else to do?

I want it to be known that I am not asexual but I dont want to seem sl*tty      Thank you in advance!
20090220214929AArnxur	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Its my relationship....Any one give their input? PS long story..?	So I have been dating my Girlfriend Elizabeth for about ten months..... We had a perfect relationship, just occasional fights and arguments over little stuff. I love her i really do. She loves me too.... We talk about everything together, waiting till marriage for eachother, death, life, and she has my heart, is my heart, my full heart.      A couple months ago she went to this party for this girls 16th birthday party. Long story short she doesn’t drink, neither does this other guy Zack, they talk about me and general stuff then he kisses her on the lips.... She kisses him back then stops. She kisses him five minutes later. (it was just a kiss, no tongue)  A few days later after we had been close(no sex) and gotten in a fight because she was constantly texting this Zack kid, and I didn’t know him and she was enjoying it too much. At first she denied it, thought I was controlling and idiotic, she told me after I convinced her we could do anything in our relationship always, we just need to talk, I even sang to her... Then she told me. =(      After a couple days of little talk i said i forgave her, love her, but trust is a hard thing to build.... But i am willing, i love her so much.      We carried on the same as before just the usual little fights over nothing, it took a couple weeks to get close again (not sex) because i realize it was just a kiss and maybe she was just afraid cause i was going to college.       Anyhow after three weeks we fight again because she is texting Zack still! She says he is just friends, i believe her and after talking and arguing i said that regardless of what is or is not between you two(Elizabeth and Zack), this Zack is hurting our relationship badly, with memories and trust. I thought it best to just tell him to leave her alone and delete his contact, she agreed also and did it right the. I even asked that she is not feeling guilt into this relationship and was doing that because she truly wanted to, she did.      Well its been two months and today at lunch she asked what time it was, i said i don’t have my cell phone to check the time, ill check hers. I move to her seat and get her phone right out of her lap. She then freaks out and starts tickling me and stuff.... I know what is going on, i look at her messages and it is stuff to this guy named William, like "when do i get my hug today, and i Couldn’t give you one cause Rico was there" I was fine with this but on my instincts i looked at the number....      It was Zack saved under a different name....      My heart hurts, i love her with my whole heart, it just sank and threw up alone back at shcool, i left for home and shut off my phone.       Zack is going to date this other girl, so they are just friends, well he sees her as just a friend. =(       I tried calling now, at night.... No answer.... Text.....no answer.... e-mail- nothing. I was thinking just giving it a break for a while to see her true motives, if she loves me like she says. Help anyone...? She is the most beautiful girl i know, i dream of her nightly, have a bear with her perfume, would do anything for her. I love her. I just want to set up breakfast tomorrow so we can talk and tell, what we think. I have been hurt so much  twice... But I love her! Help... 8 ( And she loves me i know it, just doesnt think like me, I cry over this stuff, she would be angry in my position, but overall she is a very sweet girl but might not fully understand, and i might not either. Im just confused i suppose, and blah i dono i dono i dono i dono         Oh and she thinks im mad at her, which i am but 99 percent sad....

20090220215352AA8KDeK	Family & Relationships;Friends	Group of four best friends but I think one of them hates me..?	So I have three other best friends and I've know them all for a pretty long time. I'm completely comfortable and myself around one, and more or less the same around the other (who kinda is like the "leader" even though she doesn't try to be) and then the last one...well I've never been in any of her classes so i feel like we're not really friends. She never makes any effort to get to know me but when i ask her about it she says she feels that I don't make the effort. Her personality isn't exactly sweet but more sarcastic and cunning and so she doesn't comfort people very well or show affection much, and I am a very sensitive person so it doesn't really help. She also favors the leader of our group. They sort of break off into their own clique and always think of each other before the rest of us without meaning to and I have jealousy problems. Time and time again i tell myself that everything's fine but i talked to the other girl being left out and she said she feels the exact same way so i can't be crazy. I feel like this girl doesn't even like me that much because she's always scoffing and rolling her eyes and just walks away to talk the the "leader". I just don't know what to do or feel.
20090220215635AA7iNlm	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I am so confused?!?!?	So there is this boy that I am really good friends with and he treats me so good and is super nice but for some reason I don't like him. He keeps askin me out and says he has never met anybody like me. I'm startin to wonder if I'm just shallow because I think the main reason I don't like him is because he is just like me! I know that sounds really odd but it's true! Whenever we are talking on the phone or texting and I ask him what he's up to he always says "Home watching TV" and usually that's what I'm doing. I am such a home-body. I always want to be home. You would think that I would love having a guy like that but I wouldn't and don't. I want somebody that is the complete opposite of me. Somebody who will make me get up off my lazy butt lol.      So how can I just forget about something stupid like that and just like him? I am in desperate need of help =]

20090220215229AAsZFeK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	EX- Girlfriend problems this is getting horrible?	SO here is the long story, me and my girlfriend dated for a year and a half and before last summer we broke up.  ME and HER were amazing together it we were each others first kiss and everything we got semi- sexually but we never had sex, so when we broke up it was a huge deal for both of us even though we both know it was for the best.  So that summer she changed into some crazy wild girl that i didnt even know anymore, she started drinking so much and that started to lead to all the hookups, she got fingered by so many guys this summer a long with a whole bunch of random hookups, one night she even called me drunk saying i was a **** up and how she was getting fingered by so many guys, and on top of this all she got a boyfriend so obviously seeing my ex girlfriend and my best friend change into some wild party girl it hurt me so much.  So then we get back to school and i ignore her for a while because i am so hurt but finally she apologizes and tells me she wants me back.  And me being a nice guy who just wanted his old fantastic girlfriend i regretfully said that would be cool.   So we dated for a good 3 or 4 months and it was awesome we were happier than ever and i loved it, but then people started telling me more people she hooked up with (This is after she told me everything that happened this summer and promised me that she told me everything and the truth) and i caught her in so many lies so i started getting really upset and then on top of all of this i found out that she had sex and she doesnt even remember what happened.  So she was so upset of this and i was just trying to be there for her but finnally i decided she isnt worth it i cant deal with this pain so we broke up again offically. ( that was in december) so ever since then we have tryed to become friends twice and both times i find out she lied to me again.  so now i am in the same situation were we are trying to be friends i realize now that i cant even look at her without being reminded of all the **** that happened in the last couple of months including the summer.  So my question is how should  i handle this situation, i ahve tryed everything..ignoring her, talking to her everything i just dont know what to do to handle the pain anymore.  Please help me i need this and i am tired of feeling upset for things that i did not do. PLease    thank you so much

20090220215455AA8MgRN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm lost without him, why did god take him away from me?	Ben Pressley - R.I.P   F*ck. The most outgoing goodlooking coolest loving guy you would ever meet. This guy made my world so bright, he made me feel something ive never felt before; love. Weve all got so much to learn from him, its not funny. He lived his years of growing up to the fullest, and i guess its cuz youd never no what could happen next. Ben will always be in my heart and my mind, wherever i go, whatever i do. I dont think anybody, anybody could forget this kid. He was perfect; good-looking, surfed, really athletic and fit, had a sweet body, a good tan, and a heart. He had a real heart. There is not any moment that i could take back spending with him, i think we both taught eachother alot about life, about love. No matter how many stupid and foolish things we did to hurt eachother, deepdown we had already forgiven eachother. He helped me realise that life is too short, and we should all live it up, take every chance we can, be confident and just love life for what youve got. Ben completed my heart, not a day went by without thinking about him, not a day went by without missing him. And he only lived like a 5-10 minute drive away, and i saw him everyday at school. I cant imagine how im going to cope with this now. So many people love him, he touched so many peoples hearts, he really will never be forgotten. If i could relive just everything that included Ben in my life and just repeat it everytime it came to this, id do it no doubt, no doubt at all. I love him so much you wouldnt understand, i think the only one who would, would be him. All the memories everything about him and the **** that just reminds me of him, is constantly flowing through my head. But this is just a dream, im gonna wake up sometime soon and hes gonna be there, looking over me again while i sleep. It cant be real, out of all other people it had to be Ben. So it cant be real, he gets through everything, hes invincable with everything. Nobody deserves to go through with what his family, close friends and girlfriend had to. I didnt know how to say good-bye, i didnt know how i could leave him. I mean c'mon Ben, whos gonna teach me to surf? Whos gonna show me Gerringong? I guess im just on my own now, but not completely, youll be there, laughing at me while i attempt to surf, and i know youll be happy when i get to see the place you loved most. Youll always be in my heart, how could i ever forget you? You are what made the past 8 months the best 8 months for someone to ever live. I need you so much Ben, but im gonna be strong, ill be strong, for you baby. The last words you said to me were "i love you" and i will treasure that saying coming from you forever. I love you to Ben, i love you to. I will do so many things for you. Youll see. Everybodys thinking of you Ben, people from N.S.W and QLD. I miss you Ben, but i guess im gonna have to deal with that for a while, till i get to see you again. So ill see you again later i guess haye, I love you babe. R.I.P you will always be carried in my heart - forever.

20090220215757AAxjM7Y	Family & Relationships;Family	Moving as a teenager????	alright, so I've been living here since I was just a little kid, and all the sudden, the year RIGHT before highschool starts, my parents are talking about this new job opportunity.   I wouldn't be so mad about it if they'd just stop constantly talking about it so much.   so today, they call me into the computer room and tell me to look at houses with them. They know that I would refuse to move. I won't do it. but they just keep firing these stupid little comments and stuff.      so looking at houses is a pretty much a sign that it's really going to happen right?      but then I was in the car with my mom and she is like, "I'm not going to get my hopes up.. blah blah, we probably won't get the job, blah blah"    it's just mixed signals!      I'm just so mad because I have had the greatest year this year, and know everyone so well. I just got settled in the right croud and they spring this on me.   okay, enough of my sob story;         so, my question to you is,   how bad is it when moving right before highschool?   is it really difficult to settle in and stuff?
20090220215823AAVubcE	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is my friend acting like this all of a sudden?	Me and my best friend are both friends with this guy.

She would also try to get attention or push me out of the way when he was talking to me or walking with me((she would cut in front so i would not be next to him anymore)). So, now since i told her I thought she was going to lay off of him and let me have my chance to get more friendly with him and let him get to know me better without her in the way of everything cause. but still she criticized me in front of him and made me look bad by saying i was fat a((which im not)) and says im too pale and i should get  tan because pale is ugly and abnormal. and she acts all cool by saying she has so many friends or she is better then me.she may be a little full of herself lately though. but anyways  i ask her if she liked him and she said no ((but shes a good liar so i dont know if she was telling the truth)). I dont know why she would do this to me and embarrass me like this when all ive ever done was be nice to her and i never critsized her. since im not the kind of person who has a backbone, its hard for me to say something back and i just stand there speechless and say stupid things. and if i did say something back she would always have a comeback or something extra mean to say. im thinking its just something she is going through but im not sure why she would want to do this to her best friend, cause i know i wouldnt, and why she doesnt think its wrong.         sorry if this doesnt make any sense what so ever but i tried to make it as clear as possible!(:

I'm a virgin and I don't really go looking for sex in a relationship, but some of the kids I knew in Middle School who I never thought would ever have sex, all lost their virginity.
