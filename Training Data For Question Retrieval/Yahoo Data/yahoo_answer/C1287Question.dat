There is only one plate called the Eurasian plate that makes up both Europe and Asia... so why do they say that Europe and Asia are two different continents? I know that the Ural Mountains supposedly divide Europe from Asia and so do the Taurus and Caucasus mountain ranges. But what doesn't make sense is why Cyprus and Armenia are considered to be in Europe but Georgia and Azerbaijan are considered to be in Asia. The EU won't let Turkey join yet Cyprus and Armenia are members!? That's wrong. Sorry but rather than turning this into a political debate, why is this and who decided them to be separate continents and when?

Oddly for me I can't do Discrete/Stats, but am in Calculus AB as a junior haha...embarrassing. Here's the problem:      Ken invested $12,000 in a money market account. The money market account pays an annual percentage rate of 1.56% but interest compounded monthly. After eighteen months, Ken withdrawals the balance in his money market account and invests it all in the stock market. Ken would like his portfolio to have an overall percent gain of 36.5% from the time he put the $12,000 in the money market account to a date exactly five years later. What does Ken's average annual rate of return, rounded to the nearest hundredth of a percent, need to be, assuming the interest is compounded semi-annually in the stock market, in order to accomplish his goal?      Thanks to who ever answers and I'll be sure to give the best answer out to....the best one? Haha, thanks again!

(i mean, i understand how you get the slope and that it equals m, but i don't know where you put the coordinate points once you pick one. is b (the y-intercept) basically just y?)      i don't want to give the actual points because i want to do it myself, but can someone show me how you set up an equation like that? i really don't understand.      (0,1) and (3, 4), or just make up your own points.      thank you.         (and if you know of a website that shows you this sort of math thing, please give me a link, it would really help me.)

20090309164935AAlykOY	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Help with Biology! URGENTT!!!?	My hypothesis for my experiment about genes is    "If kidney beans are put into a ziplock bag and covered with either blue, green, red, or clear then the darker colors (green and blue) will take in more light, therefore producing more chlorophyl because darker colors will reflect less light."   Basically we were just taking kidney beans placing them into damp paper towels in ziplock bags wrapped up in clear, red, green and blue plastic wrap, and then placing them under light. The problem was "How does the Color of light affect how much chlorophyl the chlorophyl producing gene produces?"   I've doing research and discovered that red and orange, take in more chlorophyl, not that that's for sure, but yeah.    I need help understanding more about this chlorophyl producing gene, and how it works, and how it relates to my problem and hypothesis.    This is Urgent!!!!

N for the percent of nitrogen, P for phosphorus, and K for potassium. So, an "8/10/5" fertilizer has 8% nitrogen, 10 %phosphorus, and 5% potassium.       Suppose you have three types of lawn fertilizer in your garden supply store.   Superlawntastic is 5/10/15,  Turf-O-Matic is 10/4/2, and DynoGreenUp is 10/5/5.   A groundskeeper for a golf course calls your store and says he needs 1000 kg of fertilizer rated 9.5/5.0/4.5.   None of your fertilizers provide exactly what he is looking for, but you figure you can make a blend of the three that will meet his needs.       a)    Set up and use a system of linear equations to determine the amount of each type of fertilizer you should use to create 1000 kg of 9.5/5.0/4.5.   b)   Suppose instead the groundskeeper had ordered 1000 kg of 8/5/5.

20090309132432AAL2yB7	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	DESPERATELY need help trying to solve this linear equation. Can anyone help?	Conan the Great has boasted to his hordes of followers that many a notorious villain has fallen to his awesome sword: His total of 560 victims consists of evil sorcerers, trolls, and orcs. These he has slain with a total of 620 mighty thrusts of his sword -- evil sorcerers and trolls each requiring 2 thrusts (to the chest) and orcs each requiring 1 thrust (to the neck). When asked about the number of trolls he has slain, he replies, "I, the mighty Conan, despise trolls 2 times as much as I despise evil sorcerers. Accordingly, 2 times as many trolls as evil sorcerers have fallen to my sword!" How many of each type of villain has he slain?      Please solve if you can. Thanks!

20090309124454AAjCfI3	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Calibration of Volumetric Glassware?	I did an experiment where I:      1) Weighed an empty conical flask.   2) Filled a 25 mL pipette (up to the gradation mark) with EQUILIBRATED WATER and transferred the water into the conical flask.    3) Re-weighed the conical flask with the water in it.    4) Repeated the steps 9 more times.       Then, my teacher asked "why is it necessary to use a buoyancy constant", and gave us the buoyancy constant as 1.0114.          Here's one of the results I got;      Mass of Conical Flask: 86.11 g   Mass of Conical Flask + Water: 110.85 g   I subtracted those two masses to get the Mass of Water which is: 24.74 g      Then, I worked out the Volume of the Water by multiplying the Mass of Water by the buoyancy constant. By doing so, I got approximately 25 mL... which was the volume of water added in the first place.      So, why then is it necessary to use a buoyancy constant?

Because the liquid is cold, none of this liquid is present in the gas phase; the flask contains only air. The flask is sealed and allowed to warm to 273 K where the liquid vaporizes to form an equilibrium mixture and you note that the pressure in the flask has increased to 1.34 atm. You determine that the partial pressure of the vapor from the liquid is 0.100 atm; calculate the mole fraction of the vapor from the liquid in the air-vapor mixture in the flask.

Or is it just when there is a number with a decimal? For example 45 divided by 5 and lets pretend you needed another zero so it would look like this in the diviser (450) right after you put that zero up do you put a decimal up it? Thank you so much!

I was watching a video about radiant energy and it was talking about how when a switch is thrown it causes energy to be discharged from the material.      This caused me to think that perhaps the electrons native to the material being charged with current were being compacted and discharged via the air to a grounding object because of the natural resistance of the material.      Which then caused me to wonder what fills back in the electrons in the material after no current is being applied. Does it simply use the leftover electrons in the material to reassemble itself into the atoms?

My null hypothesis - The rate of healing for the new drug X is equivalent to the rate of healing for the existing drug Y.      Drug trial data -      Recently a clinical drug trial was carried out on a new anti-HIV treatment which increases the rate of healing of 'seeping wounds' of AIDS sufferers. The medical biologists carrying out the trial implemented a 'double-blind' test. A total of 400 people were subjected to the trial, with two groups of equal-size for each medicine. 200 of group A were given the new drug, X, while 200 of group B were given an existing drug, Y.   At the end of 7 days everyone was assessed.   It was found that 24 of those in group A had their wounds healed.   It was found that 14 of those in group B had their wounds healed.      My results - X2 = 2.34       'One degree of freedom'      Can anyone analyse the results from the chi-squared test to determine the validity of the conclusions made?

So i am given a triangle that i dont know whether or not it is right or not. all i am given are the sides of the triangle: 12 inches, 15 inches, and 22 inches.      I am suppose to find the measure of each angle in this triangle, but i have no idea how to. i think i am suppose to use the law of sines to figure it out. [You know, SinA/a =SineB/b =SineC/c]...I Have tried setting up the equation but it seems like there isnt enough information, but i know there is.         Can someone please explain to me what to do to figure out the measures of the triangle's angles         10 POINTS TO THE BEST ANSWER..THAT EXPLAINS WELL!

20090309164955AANTE8p	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Another Financial Math Question.  Thanks!?	A home builder offers homebuyers a financing scheme whereby the buyer makes a down payment of 10% of the price at the time of purchase. At the end of each year for 5 years the buyer makes the principle payments of 2% of the original purchase price, as well as monthly payments of interest on the outstanding balance at the monthly rate of 1/2 %. Just after the fifth annual principal payment, the full outstanding balance is due (the homebuyer will negotiate with a bank for a loan of this amount). The cost of the home to the builder is 200,000 , and the builder will be selling the buyer's 5-year loan to an investor who values the loan at i(12) = .15. What should the builder set as the purchase price of the house so as to realize a net profit of 40,000 after the sale of the loan to the investor?      The answer is 330,117, I just don't understand how to get that. Any help at all is super appreciated. Thanks!

I'm putting together an after-school program where we will be talking about how footprints can be used to track animals or people.  I'd like a portion of these activities to be the kids making a casting of their own feet in the mud.  I'd prefer not to use clay just because it's more realistic.      What is the best consistency of dirt/water/mud to leave a footprint?  Several experiments I've tried show that it should be in loose mud under a puddle, but I've been hitting a dead end.  Anybody have any ideas?
