She said then that there was so much emotion in the piece she could barely handle it. As a poet, that is almost the greatest praise I can achieve.|`|bMbFw8dwaa	I write like I speak. I try to find the humor in life and particularly in mine. If I can make a reader think, laugh or cry then I have done my job as a writer. You are probably the type of writer that gets straight to the point and that is a good trait for a character. If I were writing, I would add confident and sexy at the same time as your other character traits. Keep your head up and keep writing.  I will see you in the book store.|`|gcDQpApUaa	It's mostly just friends who encourage me.<br>  <br>  But one day I printed a few things and showed them to my English teacher; she said the action in one of my stories was very visual and that the fact that I could write this well was not simply because I can speak English but because I read a lot.<br>  <br>  (I'm in a French school and am bilingual. People assume I'm good because I speak English. That isn't the reason. I read a lot and a major part of my knowledge in English is self-taught... That was a surprise for my mom...

At least it shows you are thinking. <br>  I don't know if this composition is by accident or design, if you were influenced by other examples presented in the same way or if this is a product of your own unfettered imagination working in isolation, but to condemn it because 'you cut the legs off' seems a little short-sighted. <br>  Of course, if we don't like the shot, that's fine - where would the World be without discussion and especially without dissent; I only ask that we allow for the possibility of more than one vision of existence.

Usually, once you start writing the book will reveal itself.|`|cciB0SmBaa	John,<br>  <br>  This is a full explanation in regards to writing novels and short stories in general. <br>  <br>  Here’s everything you’ll need to know in order to get your foot into the door of a literary agent and give yourself a chance. It’s not a guarantee, but it will help you in a lot of ways.<br>  <br>  This advice has been cut and pasted from My Documents and has appeared in YA more times than I can remember, but it’s the best way to get your best foot forward.<br>  <br>  <br>  Read on:<br>  <br>  Writing a book takes more than just sitting down and putting your idea into words. There are a lot of things that you have to consider.<br>  <br>  Keep an eye out for spelling and grammar errors. When typing fast with fresh ideas in our heads, we tend to forget ourselves. Check and recheck your work. Editors are very expensive these days. When checking your work over, try not to put too much trust into Spell Check if you’re using MS-Word or any other writing program. Words can be spelled correctly but used in the wrong context. Spell Check will not find those as being an error. <br>  <br>  You’ll need to know how to write an effective ‘query letter’ to a literary agent. The letter will also include a synopsis that will hold the interest of the agent, and want to make him or her ask for the first three chapters of your work. Never send a manuscript to a publisher or literary agent without querying first. There ‘are’ some publishers who will allow this, but you have to make sure you follow the guidelines for submitting to a Tee.<br>  <br>  You’ll need to know how to format your manuscript. This includes the fonts (size and type) that most agents, editors, and publishers want. These are usually Courier New and Times New Roman (12 pt). Short stories and novels are formatted differently. You will need to follow submission guidelines just as they are laid down for your submissions. Anything less will result in your manuscript sent back or destroyed unread. <br>  <br>  You will need to know what Point of View (POV) is. Know how to write in First Person Point of View. You’ll need to know the can and can not of each. <br>  <br>  Do you know how to write dialogue? How to format dialogue? This is very important and allows the author and his/her characters to communicate with the reader. Remember dialect as well. Dialect is how a person speaks. Your characters may be highly educated or dumber than dishwater. ‘Ain’t got none’ is highly acceptable when used properly by a character who is even less than street smart. Keep in mind that it’s not a good idea to have two or more people speaking in the same paragraph. Each person speaking should have their own paragraph. Some may argue this point, but to be plain and simple, it’s not the right format. It’s confusing and it’s very amateurish looking. <br>  <br>  It’s a good idea to know some of the publishing laws. The use of names and places. <br>  <br>  These include<br>  o Delivery Of Satisfactory Copy <br>  o Permission for Copyrighted Material <br>  o Grant Of Rights <br>  o Proofreading and Author's Corrections <br>  o Advances and Royalties <br>  o Author's Warranties and Indemnities <br>  o Copies to Author <br>  o Option Clause<br>  <br>  Learn how to get a ‘word count of your work. Some novels have a prologue and an epilogue. You’ll need to know how to write them and why they’re used. <br>  <br>  Know what the word ‘genre’ means. Horror, Mystery, Science Fiction; These are all genres.<br>  <br>  One of the most important issues in manuscript submitting is the proper ‘page set up’ for your work. This includes margins, indents, and paragraphs. Most editors will want to see your manuscript double spaced. This allows the editor to use his/her proofreaders marks between the lines. Most margins will be one inch all around with a ragged right margin and an even left.<br>  <br>  Are you prepared to do a lot of ‘research’ involving your work? Remember that many professionals such as, doctors, lawyers, nurses, public accountants, judges, architects, bricklayers, engineers, and police officers read, too.<br>  <br>  Do you know what a sub-plot is? This is a plot that comes ‘under’ the main plot. The hero may be after the vampire, but the mob may be after the hero as well. This is a sub-plot.<br>  <br>  Can you take rejection and constructive criticism? If you’re easily hurt in the feelings department, then writing may not be your forte. Critics will tear you apart or build you up. The best writers in the world “King, Patterson, Koontz, J.K. Rowling, and many others” have been torn up one side and down the other. You can’t please everyone.<br>  <br>  If you decide to hire an editor, remember: Your manuscript will be double spaced, which means there will be twice as many pages. A 600 page novel could cost you around $1800.00, some even more depending on what the editor charges per page. Then there’s the hourly rate that some charge. Usually it’s within the range of $65.00. So, if they work on your book for 18 hours, that’s another $1170.00 + $1800.00 = $2970.00.<br>  <br>  Remember that if you are a minor you can’t get into a binding contract without your parents or legal|`|C2FkuVESaa	Start out pre-writing, then just do what feels natural. It's not terrible to write chapters out of sequence or whatever you wish. I know one girl who starts with a conclusion and works her way backwards. Do what feels right; best advice I can give. <br>  <br>  Be willing to edit, revise, peer review, edit some more, and did I mention revise? NO work is complete the minute it is written, and anyone who tells you otherwise is lying. Writing is a long, hard-work process, not just putting words on a page. Those who refuse to edit or be revised end up reading like Harlequin novels or Stephenie Meyer.<br>  <br>  If you want to publish, you've probably got a long road ahead of you. Subscribe to places like Writer's Market when you've finished it as best as YOU can and submit chapters to available agents. They will read, reject, accept, all sorts of things. Beyond that, it's up to you and them.|`|AA10445658	write the author,, the title in the places that you want to share,, interesting so that the readers will enjoy to read the books.

XOnSRoR2aa	Since this is the Books & Authors section you are unlikely to find as many people knowledgeable about moving to California as you will in the Los Angeles one. It's in the Travel category. <br>  <br>  I've lived in LA since I was four (13 years) and am perpetually meeting people who have moved out here to pursue acting and singing. It's such a frequently asked question in the Los Angeles section here that the Top Contributor Obviousman has the answer already written out and saved on Word document so he can just cut and paste. While there are a few people like Charlize Theron who get discovered randomly in LA, the vast majority come out here optimistic and sure stardom will come only to leave a few years later jaded and deep in debt. Most work minimum wage jobs as extras where they are treated like cattle or spend their days at casting calls alongside the hundreds of others. They spend a fortune on acting classes and head shots, live in overcrowded crummy apartments in the Valley and can barely get by. It's not a pretty or glamorous lifestyle in the least. <br>  <br>  If you truly want to come you should wait until you can afford it. The job market is terrible here, and the industry is doing really, really poorly. You probably couldn't even get a temp job or extra work. Maybe you could do local acting work and take classes and build up a bit of a resume and have more money in the bank and then come. The cheapest places are in the Valley like Burbank, Glendale, Van Nuys, Woodland Hills, Chatsworth (home of the porn industry) or the Inland Empire. In LA Mar Vista, Korea Town, East LA and the super seedy parts of Hollywood are the cheapest. You'll still probably pay around $1000 a month, though. Just check the ads on Craigslist.<br>  <br>  I don't know how old you are, but you might want to consider coming here as a student. Even if you just went to a community college like Santa Monica College you could take acting classes far more affordably and maybe get loans for housing expenses. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!<br>  <br>  ~ Pax / Peace|`|IVjspiStaa	you want to live like "Grapes of Wrath"?<br>  that's why this is in the book section.?|`|212f69c39fa5a6ab750bce7d375539f1aa	San Diego is about an hour or so from LA and is a little bit cheaper.

The word love can refer to a variety of different feelings, states, and attitudes, ranging from generic pleasure to intense interpersonal attraction. The word love is both a verb and a noun. Love is not a single feeling but an emotion built from two or more feelings. Anything vital to us creates more than one feeling, and we also have feelings about our feelings (and thoughts about our feelings)[1]. This diversity of uses and meanings, combined with the complexity of the feelings involved, makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, even compared to other emotional states.<br>  <br>  As an abstract concept, love usually refers to a deep, ineffable feeling of tenderly caring for another person. Even this limited conception of love, however, encompasses a wealth of different feelings, from the passionate desire and intimacy of romantic love to the nonsexual emotional closeness of familial and platonic love[2] to the profound oneness or devotion of religious love.[3] Love in its various forms acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts.<br>  <br>  <br>  this is the meaning of love.|`|XE1OKdOOaa	There is no such thing.Love is an emotion,and it cannot be defined precisely.There are different types of love,different types of people,who feel different types of emotions:the strong ones,the lasting ones,the pure,sincere,unforgettable and beautiful ones...and there are short,quick love affairs,which cannot compete with previous mentioned.Of course,they are not less important.  <br>   Although,you can love friends,strangers,and...just things.It's never the same thing-always different with different people.  <br>    Hope I haven't confused you....Love someone and you'll see:-)|`|48385tGeaa	That your willing to clean their dirty underwear. <br>  <br>  <br>  YAY!|`|yuuvBSKsaa	Love is considering the self interest of another as though it were your own.|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...the love of my life...my wife...

There is nothing antecedent to existence, nothing apart from it—and no alternative to it. Existence exists—and only existence exists. Its existence and its nature are irreducible and unalterable.<br>  <br>   Leonard Peikoff “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,”<br>  Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, 148<br>  <br>  This doctrine is drawn from the concept of "nothingness." "Nothingness" cannot be the default of position of existence before anything existed. So you see where the contradiction is?<br>  <br>  It is this: If "nothingness" existed before "somethingness," then "nothingness" WAS "somethingness", in which case "nothingness" never existed---as in fact it cannot exist.<br>  <br>  The Big Bang is not the beginning of existence. It's only the beginning of this particular incarnation of the universe. All the matter existed inside the mass that blew up.<br>  <br>  It is futile to ask where that matter came from. It didn't come from anywhere because that would require that before it came from somewhere, "nothingness" was the state of existence--which logically cannot be the answer.|`|yOK32PM9aa	Individual things came to be by evolving out of other things.  The one great big thing?  As for that, I don't know. It might be that there are some things that the human mind simply can't meaningfully decide on, other than creative speculation.  Asking a part of something (the human mind) how the whole thing (the entire space-time continuum) came to be, might be a question with no answer.|`|yuuvBSKsaa	The big bang makes perfect sense if you add the big crunch.<br>  <br>  Evolution is the theory of how life changes NOT were did mater/energy/existence come from.<br>  <br>  Some people think the Natural Laws that govern the Universe (Logos) are a person of sorts.  aka God.  But the IQ of the Logos is irrelevant to question of absolute origin.<br>  <br>  Because the bottom line is this.  <br>  <br>  LOGIC is the study of cause & effect.   A THEORY is a LOGICAL suggestion of what caused a given effect.<br>  <br>  So you can have a Theory on how one form of Energy-Space-Time became a different form, but NOT on how something came from nothing.<br>  <br>  Understand?  Theories & Logic ARE the study of Cause AND Effect --- so by definition one cannot have a Theory, nor a Logical discussion on 'First Cause'  or a causeless effect,....because Logic is the relationship between the two.|`|f01jXc8naa	See,<br>  that's the deepest thing any human can think of.<br>  im sure you r aware that space is ever expanding.<br>  it means there is still nothingness around space which it is yet to cover and that nothingness will never end.<br>  <br>  explaining basic of the basic is very difficult<br>  in the same way you can just get lost thinking about this.<br>  <br>  the big bang does make sense.<br>  the fact that space is ever expanding agreed to big bang<br>  things have to start from somewhere<br>  before that there was nothingness.<br>  and then it started to expand.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  everything turned out because that's the way it had to be<br>  you would ask the same question if the universe was different that this.<br>  <br>  we still have to solve a lot of mysteries.|`|ngZ4edyjaa	let's start from the beginning.<br>  <br>  you had no volition to be born.<br>  you have no volition to die.<br>  everything else is sugarcoated.<br>  the end.<br>  <br>  you will be dust and atoms in 4,160 weeks (52x80) if you live until 80 years old.<br>  who honestly wants to live with so much pain beyond 80 anyways.<br>  if you sleep 8 hours out of 24 hour period, you are idle 1/3 of your life.<br>  you spend 12 years in grade school and 6 years in college to make less than average income.<br>  the elements of humans are laid out in the periodic table.<br>  religion is a joke.|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...well i did find a discarded tin foil wrapper, with instructions...<br>  <br>  ...it said "...just add water it will create a brave new world..."<br>  <br>  ...with the disclaimers...<br>  ...not responsible for what you find...<br>  ...live life and make your world a better place...|`|bTA5ndeMaa	primary question addressed only:<br>  segregation and separation into individual entities is one of the key principles permitting the universe to exist.  It mainly is forced by means of gravitational and electromagnetic forces.|`|gwM3ZXuEaa	Of course God can't be explained. He lives in a frame of reality without a lot of the rules that we have, therefore rendering even perfect human logic of this frame useless in that frame.<br>  <br>  My opinion on the Origin of the Universe is simple, I believe God created it all. But I also believe in God for different reasons than his logical involvement in the creation of the world. He has been an active part of my life for as long as I am able to remember, and because of that, I accept his existence; because of that, I accept Him as the Creator.<br>  <br>  God is the only theory that makes sense, but at the same time is the only theory that requires righteous faith.<br>  ----------<br>  <br>  My philosophy on even trying to philosophize on it is this however; everything in this life that we apply logic to, is based on witnessing the procedure itself, or studying how it's environment changed because of that process. How then, can we have any logical thought on the creation of the universe? It is a process that we were not witness to, nor can we study the effects of it on it's environment. (being that it IS our environment) Thus it is an incalculable process and any attempts to calculate it would be (and are) FUNDAMENTALLY flawed. God is the only one who can know, because he was there. So trying to figure out how he did it, or how it happened, is illogical.|`|7aVOCIh4aa	PLZ READDDDDDD!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Obviously,<br>  thats one of the questions everyone asks but u gotta know the way to look at it, thats what makes someone a good philosopher....<br>  <br>  well, the space is expanding (apparently) which means that the galaxies and other matter is shifting outward towards the nothingness that 'used to be' (which was never...erm.....covered, u can say)...so that means that loooong ago the universe was extremely small and one day there was a sudden burst of energy...that is the big bang!!!<br>  <br>  there is one thing i want to share with u cuz i thought it was interesting (just give it some thought):-<br>  If u could say that the big bang actually was the beginning of SPACE :<br>  1.) Would u agree that, matter is moving outwards instead of  'space'  expanding<br>  2.)Then obviously the thought would arise that there is vacuum (nothing) outside the young nut sized 'space'. SO that means that 'the beginning of space' was just the beginning of matter which came from the abundant energy already in 'space' [which is a part of the vacuum(dont get mixed up)]....so what about the vacuum outside that nut sized region, why wasnt anything there? how did that abundant energy come to be?  how did the whole vacuum come to be?<br>  <br>  My point of view is that our universe is the way it is cuz there is just ONE way something can be possible....so since that way exists through a set of physical rules, ONLY ONE OUTCOME IS POSSIBLE....people may think that events is affected by what happens before them (so did Newton, thats why he said that if one knows all the events that took place at a particular time before an event, then one can predict the EXACT outcome) but what I think is that even the subordinate events r fixed, not cuz of the events subordinate to them but because for EVERYTHING there is just one outcome, JUST ONE!!! Im not saying that im disapproving Newton but im just modifying his idea....<br>  <br>  Now i know ur all confused so heres an example of what im saying:-<br>  If something (winning) happens in a video game, it isnt a coincidence (even if there happens to be 'gamble' involved,  cuz in games random is actually seudo random, idk how to spell that, but that means that there is some calculation done in which the time is part of the equation ....thats right, TIME) so now u might be thinking that at the time at which u...erm....activate the game, might win u the gamble..........well that part is right, but have u ever thought what determines UR ACTIONS of activating the game????.....thats what i mean....u will activate a chain reaction based on the way u think, constantly affecting the future IN ONE WAY....BUT thats not ur choice......see, u r born in a particular society constantly framing ur mind bout whats wrong and whats right, what to do, what decisions to make....let me make it simple---suppose i was born and I...erm......open my eyes and see someone, that gives me a sense of what to do (and this sense isnt random...its determined on the working of the brain WHICH INTURN is determined on the ways of physics...just like i said, a set of rules) and after me doing that, the chain reaction continues in the form of emotions which affects behaviour and the cycle continues....<br>  <br>  Sigh... u probably have no idea how long it took for me to convert this from brain format to language lol......<br>  <br>  Now dont think that i never asked myself where the cycle starts....i somewhat know the answer (theory) but its really hard to explain...lets just say fate chose the longest string.........<br>  <br>  Theres still probably some stuff i wanna share but i forgot along the way. LOL<br>  <br>  HOPE THIS HELPS<br>  <br>  PS:- glad to see some1 who talks bout god with logic....and my advice is to not get caught up in such Qs (im only talking about god, not space)......BUT ALWAYS REMEMBER man is at his best when he plays the right cards of logic. ^ _ ^

shVgCizBaa	what were the three long term? individual rights,separation of powers,democracy  scientific method, religious tolerance,----- The Age of Enlightenment or The Enlightenment is a term used to describe a time in Western philosophy and cultural life centered upon the eighteenth century, in which reason was advocated as the primary source and legitimacy for authority.<br>  <br>  Developing more or less simultaneously in Germany, France, Britain, the Netherlands, and Italy, the movement spread through much of Europe, including Russia and Scandinavia. The signatories of the American Declaration of Independence, the United States Bill of Rights and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen were motivated by "Enlightenment" principles.<br>  <br>  This period overlapped the latter Age of Reason, the English Bill of Rights serving as an impetus for the transition.<br>  Principles<br>  The intellectual and philosophical developments of that age (and their impact in moral, social, and political reform) aspired toward more freedom for common people based on self-governance, natural rights, natural law, central emphasis on liberty, individual rights, reason, common sense, and the principles of deism. These principles were a revolutionary departure from theocracy, autocracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, and the divine right of kings. The Enlightenment marks a principled departure from the Middle Ages of religious authority, absolute state power, guild-based economic systems, and censorship of ideas toward an era of rational discourse and personal judgment, republicanism, liberalism, naturalism, scientific method, and modernity.[1]<br>  <br>  Political achievements of the Enlightenment: French historian and political writer, Alexis de Tocqueville, called attention to the significance of constitutional decentralization in the United States [see constitutional and republic.]- the separation of powers into three relatively independent centers, the territorial division of power between federal and state governments, the further de-centralization to local units, and the decentralization of judicial process through the Anglo-American system of trial by jury.[2] See also, rule of law. The French Revolution took a more desperate and dangerous turn. During the Reign of Terror the revolutionary authorities executed countless enemies of the people. Moreover, the French republic, the French experiment in democracy, was vulnerable. After the fall of monarchy, the French wavered between democracy and dictatorship. As de Tocqueville said, "In the French Revolution there were two opposite tendencies which must not be confused; one favored freedom, the other despotism."[3][edit] Influence<br>  A variety of 20th-century movements, including liberalism and neo-classicism, traced their intellectual heritage back to the Enlightenment. Geometric order, rigor, and reductionism were seen as Enlightenment virtues.[citation needed] The modern movement credits reductionism and rationality to Enlightenment thinking.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  Historian Peter Gay asserts the Enlightenment broke through "the sacred circle,"[8] whose dogma had circumscribed thinking. The Enlightenment is held to be the source of critical ideas, such as the centrality of freedom, democracy, and reason as primary values of society. This view argues that the establishment of a contractual basis of rights would lead to the market mechanism and capitalism, the scientific method, religious tolerance, and the organization of states into self-governing republics through democratic means. In this view, the tendency of the philosophes in particular to apply rationality to every problem is considered the essential change. From this point on, thinkers and writers were held to be free to pursue the truth in whatever form, without the threat of sanction for violating established ideas. However, the Romanticism movement that originated in the second half of the 18th century[citation needed] had argued that the Enlightenment elevated reason to the unwarranted status of a new authority <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enli...</a><br>  <br>  No brief summary can do justice to the diversity of enlightened thought in 18th-century Europe. Because it was a value system rather than a set of shared beliefs, there are many contradictory trains to follow.[citation needed] In his famous essay "What is Enlightenment?" (1784), Immanuel Kant described it simply as freedom to use one's own intelligence.[9]|`|AA11484029	Perhaps most critical: the decline in the power of kings and the rise of the idea of democracy -- that power should rest in the hands of the people.<br>  <br>  The renewal of interest in art and literature, plus the art, literature and music of the renaissance and enlightenment periods.<br>  <br>  The growth of the scientific method, and the still on-going clash between science and religion.<br>  <br>  The protestant reformation, and its impact on faith.

Class warfare can emerge from simple people acting in their own best interest without any conspiracy or tactics required.  The rich persue policies that are best for themselves.  The poor do the same.  Different policies causes division and more rich-get-richer, poor-get poorer, because the rich have more power.|`|yuuvBSKsaa	Sure.

d04ae6ff8e12fe20d1db30d24b4bc806aa	Of course there is. But to say that is not to imply that we can know what the answer is.<br>  <br>  For example, there is an answer to the question, "Where is the electron at any given moment; and is the electron a particle, or a wave?"<br>  <br>  There are answers. But unless there is a revolution in physics, we can never have the answer.<br>  <br>  Who was Jack the Ripper? It's a question I've considered for a long time.

Cheers.|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G The unkown can be recognized as such and accepted as unknown in a rational system of thought. The most rational I have encountered include the understood and the not understood as a fusion. That fusion is called Myoho. It is encompassed in the LDK.<br>  Life Decryption Key<br>  Short Version<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be one’s decisions based on clarity, That means dumping the guesses and agendas and focusing on what is verifiably pragmatic<br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed so succinctly in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing. <br>  <br>  This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones<br>  The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.<br>  <br>  Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.

OhWmu0R3aa	The majority of Irish with Scots heritage usually come from what is now Northern Ireland or Ulster.<br>  <br>  This came about due to the planting of protestant and calvinist Scots in Ulster in the 17th century by James I. This was extended to a larger and harsher degree by the puritan Oliver Cromwell during the Commonwealth (1649-1660) after the English Civil War. His hatred of catholics led to hundreds of catholic Irish being forced from their homes or murdered to make way for the Scottish settlers.<br>  <br>  Over the years these settlers became considered as Irish as those they had displaced and many took the same action during the great famine of the mid-19th century as others - they emmigrated to the US, the majority settling on the east coast cities such as New York, Boston and Baltimore.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	I'm not sure but from what I understand they were from Northern Ireland and/or Irish Protestants (of course all of Ireland was British until about 1920 or so) <br>  <br>  In America there was a lot of prejudice against Catholics and anybody with an Irish name was assumed to be Catholic. So the term was a way to avoid anti-Catholic thinking against the Irish.<br>  <br>  I've also heard that Elizabeth I or even Henry VIII moved Protestants from Scotland into Ulster to try and outnumber the Irish. That would have been a couple of hundred years before they were coming to America. Some of the Scotch-Irish may have actually been a mixture.|`|pI5jKfmaaa	Who were the scot irish?<br>     <br>  They were protestant Presbyterian, Lowland Scots. The Scot-Irish were not Irish and were not Catholics. The term Scot-Irish is strictly an American nomenclature. In England and Ireland the same people are called Ulster Scots, which is much less confusing. <br>  <br>   For greater and in - depth details visit the following links :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.greencastlemuseum.org/Local_History/scotch-irish.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.greencastlemuseum.org/Local_H...</a> <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.barlowgenealogy.com/Resources/scots-irish.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.barlowgenealogy.com/Resources...</a>|`|shVgCizBaa	<a href="http://www.barlowgenealogy.com/Resources/scots-irish.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.barlowgenealogy.com/Resources...</a>       Tracing the Scots-Irish   They've been called a people without a name.  Their roots go back to Scotland, but don't think tartans and bagpipes.  They were Lowlanders, mostly coming from the border regions of Galloway, Dumfries, Renfrewshire, Ayrshire, Argyllshire and Lanarkshire in the west and Edinburgh, the Lothians and Berwichshire in the east.  They spoke English and were Protestant, specifically Presbyterian.<br>  <br>  They were different from their Highland cousins.  They didn't wear kilts, didn't belong to clans, or speak Gaelic.  But they weren't English either.  They didn't support the Anglican Church.  They held onto the memory of bloody massacres that their ancestors suffered at the hands of English conquerors centuries earlier.<br>  <br>  Their history in Scotland was not pleasant.  These people were caught, both geographically and politically, between the English to the south and the Highlanders to the north.<br>  <br>  In the seventeenth century, when Scottish and English land-grant owners sought tenants to populate the northern region of Ireland and drive out the Catholics, the Lowland Scots fit the bill.  They were not Catholic and they spoke English.  To the English monarchy, the Lowland Scots were preferable to the Irish Catholics.  The downtrodden Lowlanders had suffered endless cattle raids, had themselves resorted to such raids because of their poverty, and had lived on infertile, over-farmed land for centuries.  The prospect of large, bountiful tenant farms in Ireland, a short jaunt across the Irish Sea, was more than appealing.<br>  <br>  But as the decades passed, the transplanted Scots became known as dissenters.  They did not vow allegiance to the Church of England, detesting tithing to a church they didn't support, and were governed by the Penal Laws.  Those laws prevented dissenters from voting, bearing arms or serving in the military.  Dissenters could not be married, baptized or buried with the assistance of any minister who was not ordained by the church of the state.<br>   <br>  WHY DID THEY COME TO AMERICA <br>  The answer seems obvious, but by the eighteenth century some of the restrictive laws had loosened.  Despite that, the dissenters were bitter.  To further aggravate the situation, when rents came due on many of the farms they lived on, the cost rose double -- or more.  This practice was called rack-renting.  Those who worked in the linen industry also suffered at this time because England had begun preventing the Irish from exporting their product beyond the mother country.<br>  <br>  Family members who had already ventured to America sent back glowing reports about the fruitful land.  Ship owners sent men to the countryside to extol the benefits of emigration to the peasants.  While some departed seeking adventure, most Ulster residents didn't want to leave Ireland, but their backs were against the wall.  Ireland held no opportunities.<br>  <br>  There were five time periods when the Scots-Irish emigrated in large numbers:  1717-18, when a destructive drought killed crops, the linen industry was crippled and rack-renting prevailed; 1725-29, when continued rack-renting and poverty prompted such a massive departure that even the English Parliament became concerned (it feared losing Protestant majority in the area); 1740-41, when a famine struck and letters from relatives living in America were persuasive; 1754-55, a time of a disastrous drought; and 1771-1775, when leases on the large estate of the marquis of Donegal in County Antrim expired and the tenants couldn't afford to renew them.  Years when economic pressures in Ireland were the greatest were when large exoduses occurred.  The numbers dropped  during the years of the French and Indian Wars (1754-63) and came to a crashing halt during the American Revolution.<br>  <br>  Today, the people living in Ulster still remember their relatives who sailed for America.  Located in County Tyrone, the Ulster American Folk Park boasts an early eighteenth century stone house that once stood in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.  It was built by Samuel Fulton, an emigrant from Northern Ireland. <br>  <br>  The Scots-Irish, like other groups of American immigrants, came to the New World to escape economic and religious hardships.  Wealthy people and people of influence rarely braved the harsh Atlantic voyage.  The Scots-Irish had plenty of reason to come, and come they did.  It's estimated that between 1717 and 1775, a quarter-million people emigrated from Ulster to America.  At the time of the American Revolution, at least one out of every 15 Americans was Scots-Irish.<br>  <br>  Ocean travel was not inexpensive, and most often the people willing to make the trip were the ones who could least afford it.  Most came as indentured servants.  Someone in America would pay for the passage, and the traveler would labor in return for a period of time, usually between one and seven years.  At the term's end, the person usually had acquired a trade.  In addit|`|AZgIkmfxaa	Irish people lived in Ireland first. Population expansion and conflict forced one clan, the Ui Neill to migrate east across the Irish Sea to the west coast of Scotland. This took place thousands of years ago. Irish Gaelic and Scots Gaelic are very similar languages.<br>  <br>  Since the shared many cultural and language similarities. It was/is quite common for intermarriage. In my own case, my parents are from England, but my maternal grandparents are from Ireland and my paternal grandparents are from Scotland. This makes me of Ire-Scot ancestory.<br>  <br>  Migration to North America (and other colonies) took place after the establishment of the industrial revolution. In case of Scotland a combination of economic conditions, The Clearances, and the promise of free land and new life motivated many Scots to emigrate.<br>  <br>  In the case of Ireland, The Potato Famine in the mid-19th century, forced a mass migration of Irish to other parts of the world.|`|2ec3c76fd8030a72563cfb9a02cf55e2aa	The term "Scotch-Irish" is used to denote people who emmigrated to America in the early 1900s, and began to flood the eastern states with a mixture of cultures and genetics.  Due to social intermixing of the Scottish and Irish populations, and the difficulty in discerning the two, the term Scotch-Irish was born.|`|KHSOVxViaa	Nope, they are a people that lived (and still live) in both Scotland and Ireland.<br>  <br>  They are more commonly known as the Ulster-Scots.  Their ancestry is mostly a mixture of Gaelic-language speakers who straddled the northern Irish Sea (modern Northern Ireland and western Scotland) and Saxon-descended people living in the border region between Scotland and England.<br>  <br>  Before they acquired a common identity, these peoples were part of the patchwork of identities that made up the British Isles as tribes migrated and local nation states were forming.  The Scots were an Irish people who migrated to and effectively created Scotland, spreading their Gaelic language through much of the country.  The Saxon-speakers of the south, immigrants after the collapse of the Roman Empire, came under their political domination.<br>  <br>  After the reformation in Europe, there were devastating wars as Catholics and Protestants vied for power.  This wave spread to the British Isles where a large part of the population became Protestant, notably much of Scotland.<br>  <br>  At more or less the same time, The local feudal O'Neill dynasty in Ulster (northern Ireland) had revolted against their then English overlords and were eventually defeated in a savage drawn-out war.  There was a large migration of Protestant Scots (Gaels and Saxons) back to Ireland, particularly the north.  Many English migrated as well.  This 'encouraged' migration (Plantation of Ulster) was partly a deliberate attempt to plant a loyal population against future revolts, partly a result of impoverished people seeking better opportunities in a now depopulated land.  They lived alongside the predominantly Catholic Irish Gaels, and led to a split society that partly remains to this day.<br>  <br>  The subsequent tides of politics brought a see-saw of religious persecutions.  Catholics were oppressed, then Presbyterians (a type of Protestant common in Scotland and Ireland) as different rulers took power and imposed their religious views.  This see-sawing continued until the Glorious Revolution which engendered the Enlightenment.<br>  <br>  At the same time, the European colonies in the Americas were attracting migrants because of the perceived opportunities.  After Puritans from southern England had migrated for religious freedom, many Presbyterians from Ulster and Scotland made the same journey for similar reasons.  Many just migrated because America was seen as a land of opportunity.  Changes in the agricultural and economic systems made many people landless and homeless in feudal areas, so the Americas were seen as a bright light.<br>  <br>  As this was the time of early westwards migration in North America, often these people moved to the frontier and were instrumental in pushing it further west.  Many aspects of "Western" culture (square-dances, songs, religiosity) have their origin with these people.<br>  <br>  It was later on, when Catholics (often Irish) again faced political oppression and sometimes just economic impoverishment, that waves of Irish immigrants made the Atlantic journey to become one of America's prominent communities.  However, these are normally referred to as Irish-Americans, as distinct from Ulster-Scots or Scots-Irish.<br>  <br>  In a modern context, the term "Ulster Scots" refers to a dialect of the Scots language spoken in parts of Ulster.  This can arguably be described as a dialect of modern English.<br>  <br>  Well, that's the simple version of the origin of the Ulster-Scots in the Americas.|`|H58cyfKPaa	I know only at around 6th century scots drove away the celts, and they lived on scotland then. <br>  There are two main irish emigrants. The first was before the great famine in 1845-1848, when they young Irish had some money and they went to New England to make a fortune. Most of them led a successful life.<br>  The second was during the great famine. They were starved and they need to go to other countries for survivance

In fact the Lebensborn was an organisation for kidnapping small children who fit the nazi model from other countries and giving them to childless German families.

Even horrible people can have their own standards of "family values."  Whether those "family value" standards are truly good or not is open to debate.  Read the books such as "Floating in my Mother's Palm" as these describe smaller town life and are written by authors who actually lived or had family living in Nazi Germany.

However, Germany lost.  Britian, France, and its allies forced Germany to sign the Versaille Treaty which called for reparations to be made as well as take responsibility for the war (also known as the War Guilt Clause).<br>  <br>  The Allied counteroffensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive began on August 8, 1918. The Battle of Amiens developed with III Corps Fourth British Army on the left, the First French Army on the right, and the Australian Corps and Canadians spearheading the offensive in the centre. It involved 414 tanks of the Mark IV and Mark V type, and 120,000 men. They advanced as far as 12 kilometers (7 mi) into German-held territory in just seven hours. Erich Ludendorff referred to this day as “the Black Day of the German army”.<br>  <br>  The offensive slowed and lost momentum due to supply problems. British units had encountered problems with all but seven tanks and trucks running out of fuel. On August 15, General Haig called a halt and began planning a new offensive in Albert. This Second Battle of the Somme began on August 21. Some 130,000 United States troops were involved, along with soldiers from Third and Fourth British Armies. It was an overwhelming success for the Allies. The Second German Army was pushed back over a 55 kilometer (34 mi) front, and by September 2, the Germans were back to the Hindenburg Line, which was their starting point in 1914.<br>  <br>  The Allied attempt to take the Hindenburg Line (the Meuse-Argonne Offensive) began September 26, as 260,000 American soldiers went “over the top”. All divisions were successful in capturing their initial objectives, except the U.S. 79th Infantry Division, which met stiff resistance at Montfaucon and took an extra day to capture the objective. Then the US Army stalled because of supply problems as its inexperienced headquarters had to cope with large units and the difficult landscape (hilly and forested, with few roads).<br>  <br>  At the same time, French units broke through Champagne and closed on the Belgian frontier. The most significant advance came from Commonwealth units as they entered Belgium (liberation of Ghent). The German army had to shorten its front so used the Dutch frontier as an anchor and chose to fight rear-guard actions. This probably saved the army from disintegration but was devastating for morale.<br>  <br>  By the start of October, it was evident that Germany could no longer mount a successful defense, let alone a counterattack. Numerically on the frontline they were increasingly outnumbered, with the few new recruits too young or too old to be of much help. Rations were cut for men and horses because the food supply was critical. Ludendorff had decided, by October 1, that Germany had two ways out of the War—total annihilation or an armistice. He recommended the latter to senior German officials at a summit on that very same day. During October, the Allied pressure did not let up until the end of the war.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, news of Germany’s impending military defeat had spread throughout the German Armed forces. The threat of general mutiny was rife. Naval commander Admiral Reinhard Scheer and Ludendorff decided to launch a last ditch attempt to restore the “valor” of the German Navy. Knowing any such action would be vetoed by the government of Max von Baden, Ludendorff decided not to inform him. Nonetheless, word of the impending assault reached sailors at Kiel. Many rebelled and were arrested, refusing to be part of a naval offensive which they believed to be nothing more than a suicide bid. It was Ludendorff who took the blame for this—the Kaiser dismissed him on October 26. The collapse of the Balkans meant that Germany was about to lose its main supplies of oil and food. The reserves had been used up, but the Americans kept arriving at the rate of 10,000 a day.<br>  <br>  With power coming into the hands of new men in Berlin, further fighting became impossible. With 6 million German casualties, Germany moved toward peace. Prinz Max von Baden took charge of the new German government. Negotiations with President Wilson began immediately, in the vain hope that he would offer better terms than the British and French. Instead Wilson insisted on his Fourteen Points and demanded the abdication of the Kaiser. German soldiers were despondent. The civilian leadership was stunned to discover that Ludendorff had deluded them all along and there was no hope whatsoever for military success or even stalemate. Thus there was no resistance when the social democrat Philipp Scheidemann on November 9 declared Germany to be a republic. Von Baden then announced that the Kaiser was to abdicate, along with all other princes in the German Empire. Imperial Germany was dead; a new Germany had been born: the Weimar Republic.

Several Indian princely states, within the British Raj, provided large donations to the Allies to combat the threat of Nazism and Fascism.

Why? Because the rest is only quest and questions to seek ways and means to get rid of 'It" If the Pen is considered mightier than sword the purpose of comparison has to be clearly defined. If the intent inked out of it is meant for dispelling ignorance by inculcating sharp discrimination between things eternal and ephemeral then pen is mightier not only than sword but also all weapons of mass destruction! If, however, the inked massage is meant to instigate distraction and destruction by corrupting innocent minds into ignorance by multitude the harm caused by sword will be more honorable.|`|7tj1d2y5aa	When some writers are incapable of swaying the opinions of their readers, their arrogance causes them to consider their readers to be ignorant. And that presumptuousness is what prevented the writer's success in the first place.<br>  <br>  The pen is mightier than the sword. But, it's only as strong as the modesty of the writer wielding the pen.|`|Poo5RULPaa	Depends how large the sword is. The pen can definitely be swung faster. And if you can sneak up behind someone, a pen to the neck is a safe bet for fatality. On the other hand, if you are more of a straight forward kind of person, the sword is definitely better for head on battles, when you have already lost the element of surprise to your enemy.|`|9pTMArTQaa	If the "reader" is ignorant, it is even more powerful.<br>  You could easily convince him that his friends don't care for him and are treating him unfairly, that they are his enemies and so... he'll turn on them.<br>  Such power, the sword never had.|`|B82wuWx8aa	to my knowledge the pen always represented intelegence not literature. and sword is muscle.<br>  <br>  <br>  in my opinion a person who is really smart can easily out do a person who's all brawn.|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G A literate person can speak to the illiterate.

q33FiROraa	Good question! I don't personally think that that was the case. I think Mr. Collins was such a toady that he wouldn't have even thought to aspire so 'high' in his search for a wife. He was obsessed with their wealth but it was much more about how it reflected on him...he was happy with the small connection that having the deBourghs as patrons provided him. <br>  <br>  I don't really think that he was very interested in women - I think he did get married mostly on Lady Catherines prompting, but he was not a schemer - consider the fact that he offered for Lizzie (no real monetary benefit) and in the end married Charlotte (not really an 'heiress' so to speak). <br>  <br>  I would guess that Lady Catherine recommended he marry mostly because she liked to feel powerful and wield control over those 'beneath' her, and maybe so that Mr. Collins would bother her less!|`|6ynJBu5Yaa	In my opinion, no. Yes, he was a social climber, but he relied heavily on Lady Catherine de Bourgh's good opinion and therefore, wouldn't have risked her displeasure by trying to ''seduce'' her daughter. I think she pressured him to marry because she had been drunk with power all her life and got her entertainment from interfering in the lives of others. Also, I believe there would have been a lot of, ahem, speculation surrounding a middle aged man living alone. What fascinates me about Austen's novels is not what's said, but rather what's not said.|`|JbPGX2Adaa	no. he was just a flatterer. he needed to please people of higher social status|`|qg11igznaa	I think that's the point. Mr. Colins isn't out for women, he's out for pretige. He flatters women because he believes it will benefit him socially. He does get excited about Anne's wealth because it emphasizes his connection to a wealthy family. I can't imagine Mr. Colins seducing Anne because he would fall from favor among the higher class, which is what he is most concerned with. <br>  <br>  In fact, I do not believe that Mr. Colins is really very enthralled with any woman. He just wantes a wife because it is socially acceptible for him to do so. He changes his fancy from Jane to Lizzy to Charolette quite easily.

8b3bdd9636821c2ff2295e82ece24f73aa	Swiss Cottage is an area of North-west London in the Borough of Camden. The area is named after a Swiss Cottage which in the mid-20th Century was a restaurant called the Cottage Grill. It was originally the dairy of a farmhouse when the area was countryside but was demolished in mid-1960s. Today the name is associated with a Public House built between 1803 and 1804. This opened as "The Swiss Tavern" and is now called "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" (a pub). The building was reconstructed in 1965 in the style of a Swiss chalet or cottage. The road to Finchley in Barnet passes through here and the area is usually referred to as Finchley Road and has also given that name to the nearby tube station.<br>  <br>  Local amenities include an Odeon Cinema, Swiss Cottage Central Library, The Hampstead Theatre and assorted shops the length of the Finchley Road. The large Swiss Cottage Leisure Centre reopened in early 2006; after complete redevelopment; and now houses 2 swimming pools, a gym and a climbing wall. Adjoining neighbourhoods include Belsize Park to the East, Hampstead Village to the North East, St John's Wood to the South and West Hampstead and Kilburn to the West. Regent's Park is within walking distance. Local Hotels include a Marriot and Holiday Inn Express. Notable restaurants include Globe (European) and Benihana (Oriental griddle).<br>  <br>  Swiss Cottage is in the Hampstead and Highgate constituency for which the MP is Glenda Jackson, as of 2006.<br>  <br>  Nearest tube stations:<br>  Swiss Cottage tube station (Jubilee Line)<br>  Finchley Road tube station (Jubilee Line and Metropolitan Line)|`|00989779e269892288ca7696c3853395aa	Swissland duh!

They had a small area behind a false wall where they could hide if the Nazis came to search. When they were found out, soldiers came to search their house. They had enough time to have their nine guests hide. They were arrested and sent to concentration camps where Corrie's sister Betsie and her father eventually died, but the Jews in their house were able to escape. Corrie escaped too, seemingly by a "mistake" which was the grace of God, and spreads the message of God's guidance, love and forgiveness through Jesus. The book is suspenseful and the movie made of it is quite well made and critically acclaimed.

81a1647079cf12a83efbeeea7fc21b96aa	There are more than 3,000 versions of the Cinderella myth. Almost every world culture has one -- she's known as "Yeh Shen" in China, "The Burnt Face Girl" to the Mik'maq tribe, "Tattercoats" in England, and "Marouckla" to the Slavs. While the story can't claim a sole author, it does have a few notable interpreters. <br>  <br>  Charles Perrault was a minor literary figure in 18th-century France. In 1697, he published Comte de ma Mere L'Oye (Tales of Mother Goose), which refashioned several well-known folktales such as "The Sleeping Beauty," "Little Red Riding Hood," and "Cinderella." <br>  <br>  Perrault cleaned up the popular peasant version of the Cinderella tale for a more refined, upscale audience. In the original, the glass slipper was filled with blood from the severed toes and bunions of the wicked stepsisters! Mother Goose was translated into English in 1729, and the Brothers Grimm produced their famous German version in 1812.|`|5b8b52c5df1f9e4f7de34244485b09ebaa	The Brothers Grimm.|`|AA10723771	mickey mouse from disney|`|a0f019e6cdbcb91eeedc01fc44fd283eaa	Along with the severed toes, the eyes of the stepsisters get pecked out by doves at the end of the original...or at least, in the Grimms' version. :)
AA11435347	Yes there is a very definite manner upon which to reach all moral and principle truth, the first process in reaching this is to stop lying to one's self. This is a common trait found in all people and among all mankind, we continually find some worse than us because we constatly compare ourselves to others. Everyone wishes and does think themselves the more supeior resulting in the continuation of acts that are false and not very pleasurable to the person doing it. Such as say the preoccupation of women for the most part to their looks, if you don't look preety there is no need to lie to yourself by creating a disguise, admit the fact and pursue other endevours. Likewise can be said of men trying to impress women pursuing certain careers and actions that is not really resultant of one's true will and self, merely to put forth an appearance.|`|AA12265902	an open mind, willing to think for yourself,,, while also considering what others say,,,, is a way of being that may lead you to the truth,,,,,, some people seem to think finding truth is a  research of all that others had stated an opinion on,,, for a subject, they leave out their own creative opinion/conclusion,,,,,|`|1552c96c3f7e2c806e83680cf9e07189aa	I think the scientific method was devised to try and lead to scientific theories and truths...|`|8650ba2065c4bbd324134d41f2d7022baa	Asking the right questions.|`|AA10259171	King David in the Old Testament said that truth is the sum of the Word of God.<br>      That's a powerful observation regardless of one's own personal  notions.<br>        Gather as many pieces as you may....<br>          “What we are looking for is what is looking " is a fascinating observation by St. Francis of Assisi. <br>      Don't rely on any one "way" to wisdom.

For example, if an individual were to have encyclopedic knowledge of diverse things and construed them all to relate to each other in an unrealistic fashion, than that individual has a great capacity of knowledge, but a horrendous understanding.  Quantity is, therefore, not enough.  It is more so applying a sound methodology when examining facts that leads to the asymptote of 'truth.'  <br>  The scientific method, for example, allows one to incorportate tests, observations, known facts, and interpretation when designing a system of knowledge and 'truth.' <br>  With this method, knowledge may be validated, applied and undertstood.  The journey towards truth them becomes more evident.  <br>  Still, this is not enough.  Since humans are limited in their capacity to fathom the universe (by means of only have five senses, living strictly on Earth, and having no means to witness the past or the future in anything but predictions and 'fossils' of evidence), there is a Socratic surrender that must be acknowledged in order to achieve 'truth' in an honest way.  This 'honest' admission is the following: "Humankind, especially I myself, can never know and understand  everything."  Consequently, anything which humans employ to attempt to explain 'everything' is automatically flawed.<br>  <br>  In sum, the 'ways of knowing' that are most effective for the pursuit of truth are: sound, logical methodology used when reasoning, testing, and observaing; empirical data used for the tests and interpretations, and an acknowledgement that more truth can be known and understood, but all truth is impossible to know and understand because humans are limited.|`|AA10826311	Our minds are finite.

I havent read A Communist Manifesto for some time but I believe that he had a different term.  It is possible that the individual who first coined that word will never be known although you might trace the movement by which the etymology of the word occured.  ...ism of course is a suffix for two much of something, thus giving it a negative connotation.  It is interesting that there is a catholocism but one never hears of Protestantism.  All of our isms seem to be slanted by our own western prejudices.

Carver invented the atom bomb in 1898 while attempting to harness the power of the peanut for a peaceful energy source.  His discovery was stolen, however, along with Carver himself and Robert Johnson, the famous blues guitarist.  Johnson was kept chained in a basement for thirty years, forced to turn out hits for Woody Guthrie and Rudy Vallee.  Carver was not treated much better.  He was kept in a room twenty miles below the ground in Langley Virginia by the precursor of the CIA.  Though Carver was a pacifist, he was subjected to constant electroshock therapy and forced to direct the Allied forces in both World Wars.  When he objected to the Manhattan Project, he was painfully castrated and his brain was removed from his body and placed, still living, in  a jar where it could be more easily manipulated.  His brain did not finally die until early 1960, when it finally became senile and instigated the Bay of Pigs invasion.  But you won't find that in your precious history books, as the white man is always keeping us down.  Black Power!

Diese wird durch einen Glasrahmen noch besonders geschützt, insbesondere Pastellkreiden und  Kohle sind  "flüchtige" Medien und werden quasi von jedem Lufthauch ein wenig abgetragen.

Sehr empfehlenswert!! Der 1. Band hei?t (in der deutschen übersetzung) "Percy Jackson in: Diebe im Olymp". Die Grundidee ist, dass die griechischen G?tter noch heute leben (sie sind ja unsterblich), aber sie residieren jetzt in New York (weil immer da, wo das Zentrum der westlichen Zivilisation gerade ist - Griechenland ist also lange her). Noch immer zeugen sie Kinder mit Sterblichen, das sind dann die "Helden". So einer ist Percy, blo? wei? er es noch nicht. Er ist ein Chaot, Legastheniker etc.,  aber - Trost für alle mit Schulproblemen - so etwas ist ein deutliches Zeichen g?ttlicher Abstammung!

aOy01jFEaa	I may earnestly think of that the enemies of friendships are,<br>  1) Distrustful of others and even of oneself, that doubts too much resulting almost to paranoia. It can build a tough barrier between relationships even if when before friendship could have started. So as it may never be as real as it should be.<br>  Since already one is building thick distances to others.<br>  2) Hypocrisy or betrayals that may come up with broken friendships, As the truth may comeout eventually following up these destructive effects like of rumors, intrigues, making fictional stories against others, and unusually sensitivity to other's faults (or fault finding), jealousy, envy and other negative aspects that may unexpectedly arises at any moment.<br>  3) Disrespectfulness of others, is a harmful enemy to good friendships too. Being harsh and stubbornly harmful egoistic manner that results to selfishness and being unfeeling of others. Too much lacking of compassion and apathy. (like lacking with some real affection)<br>  4) Selfish Schemes that initiates harm of others to fulfill one's heartless desires and evil thoughts to get favors for oneself, In the expense of others. Using people as his way to get off his or her own faults and miseries. But making oneself look as gracious and dignified to others. To pursue his or her own selfishly annoying beliefs. That he or she thinks is just right!<br>  5) Making seriously fun out of others faults for the sake of criticizing or being too judgemental, That maybe can fall to the category of disrespectfulness of others.<br>  This is being unfair of other's lots..and proves dishonesty as well as disloyalty too.<br>  <br>  I have known a person who pushed his misleading belief to judge me. Just as after failing to obtain what he wants..After giving the times and attentions talking with. Then, I was being judged so harshly and falsely. Yet him, as telling others the opposite story..I still wonder why some other people can really do that? Inspite of times of being openned.<br>  How can I sacrifice my real name that I use here? Just to tell fancy lies always that makes me look real when I can really be real for true? For instance, I wasn't able to fulfill an expectation so well. Does it mean that I can not have a chance to explain? To be listened for a honest explanation? There wll be an assuming judgement already? That sadly made me discouraged by that person's individuality. <br>  So did I eventually resisted to comply for further response. That made me also froze my motives of fulfilling a favor longed for..<br>  These are real making the enemies of friendship. The distrust, delusions, selfishness and others..<br>  <br>  I think Param, You may somehow feel to know that with whom I was referring to..That I had previously experienced here..<br>  I had already forgotten that and my only intention is just to share it with others as a true encountership too..<br>  <br>  They also use to say that, Tell me who your friends are and I will tell you who you are!<br>  I'm glad I wasn't that guy's friend anymore..I need not avoid it too..So as it came up to be, That It could have been just simply that nature had divided us to sort, of what kind of a real person we can be as a friend!<br>  <br>  Hugs!

People who spread terror all over the world -- in London, in Madrid, in New York, in Washington are enemies of friendship because they create insecurity and mistrust.<br>  <br>  The Karmic consequences of Jihadist attacks extend out to many small ripples that even affect the interpersonal friendships that might otherwise develop.<br>  <br>  There is the suspicion that the entire Moslem Global community either supports or is passive about the Jihadists. It's a pyramid in which the bottom third are essentially passive, the middle third give money but do nothing violent, and the top third are training the truly dedicated militant Jihadists who are ready to die if they can kill some Westerners. They are also willing to have the wives and children die, whether those people want to or not. So the Jihadists fire missiles right from the roof of homes in civilian neighborhoods -- Gee what could happen if they do that? --- The Jihadists do not care!<br>  <br>  Thesse people are enemies of sanity and civilization -- both of which are foundational to friendship and to all cordial relations between humans. They create mistrust that extends to all Moslems because of the fact that the Moslem community worldwide does not seem to be ready to turn in the miscreants to authorities. One suspects the Pakistani government of not being ready to root out the Jihadists in South Waziristan for example. One suspects the Saudi Royals of giving money to madrassas that create the mindset for terrorism to flourish and that turn out suicide bombers. Suspicion is the opposite of friendship. <br>  <br>  So, I say the militant homicidal Jihadist movement is the greatest enemy of friwendship in the world. After them, I would say North Korea comes in second, since they are busy every day destabilizing the entire far East by creating nuclear missile threats and by proliferation of nuclear technology.<br>  <br>  This answer is just a straight answer to the question -- not some sort of coded response out of "Twilight" or any other cartoon book.

gW0nD5cEaa	It opened in about 1890. I should remember, the centennial was a big deal a few years back, but I forget exactly when.<br>  <br>  Immigrants were coming by the boatload, many boatloads, just about any day. They needed a place to check them all in, to be able to reject those who came in with TB and other diseases, and others that they determined were not fit to come into America.  By having it on an island, not the mainland, they could not easily slip out and into the city if they were not going to let them stay. They were detained at the site and then put on ships and returned if they had TB, seemed mentally ill, etc. <br>  <br>  Many people who came through Ellis Island intentionally shortened or Americanized their names, or it was done for them because the clerks checking them in could not understand or spell their names. Whatever was put down as their name was their official name, mispelled, shortened or totally wrong.|`|AA11484029	As an immigration station: January 1, 1892<br>  <a href="http://www.ellisisland.org/genealogy/ellis_island_timeline.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.ellisisland.org/genealogy/ell...</a><br>  <br>  Ruby is more or less right about the why part. Since it was an island, about two to three miles out in the harbor, it would be difficult to get off and get to Manhattan.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what your second question means. In the 1890s, the US wanted immigrants. The industrial revolution was creating huge new factories, and required coal to run them (so you need miners), so there was a huge need for new laborers. <br>  <br>  And Ellis Island kept a good record of all the immigrants who entered the country -- you can see it here:<br>  <a href="http://www.ellisisland.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ellisisland.org/</a>

Nos seus delírios, Dom Quixote luta contra moinhos achando que s?o gigantes cruéis; apaixona-se por uma rude camponesa vendo nela uma dama aristocrática. Sancho Pan?a, seu fiel escudeiro, embora tenha uma vis?o prática das coisas, é fascinado pela imagina??o de seu amo. Essas duas figuras, ao contrário dos super-heróis, sonham, têm esperan?a e fracassam, o que os torna t?o humanos. <br>        Desde sua publica??o, no Renascimento, Dom Quixote tem se mantido como uma das fontes de inspira??o e de referência dos escritores e artistas de todas as épocas. A figura de Dom Quixote se tornou por si mesma num símbolo do artista moderno em suas lutas contra as agruras de urna realidade desencantada. Satirizando o declínio dos valores aristocráticos, representados pelas gestas cavaleirescas medievais, Cervantes n?o só anuncia os impasses da cultura moderna nascente, quanto denuncia o esvaziamento da fantasia e do idealismo num mundo cada vez mais submetido aos rigores da raz?o prática e dos interesses materiais. Nesse sentido, Dom Quixote se imp?e como uma das matrizes básicas de toda a literatura moderna. Ver O Rei Artur e os cavaleiros da Távola Redonda. <br>        Nesse romance épico há referências às lutas da nobreza hispanica para expulsar os árabes, que invadiram e se instalaram na Península Ibérica. Esse longo processo, conhecido como a Guerra da Reconquista, transcorreu durante a Idade Média, assinalando a mentalidade militar e cavalheiresca da aristocracia ibérica, e repercutindo na cultura medieval como um todo. Ver El Cid. E sua conclus?o propiciou a constitui??o do Estado espanhol como uma monarquia centralizada, o que por sua vez seria a condi??o indispensável para o seu pioneirismo nas Grandes Navega??es e para a introdu??o do país na modernidade e nos valores do Renascimento. Com sua obra, Cervantes pretendia expor e criticar justamente a forte presen?a da tradi??o aristocrática medieval na cultura espanhola, derivando daí as dificuldades que o país encontrava para adaptar-se ao mundo e à cultura modernos. <br>        O conflito entre o idealismo repleto de delírios e fantasias de Dom Quixote e o realismo prático e rasteiro de Sancho Pan?a comporta um dos mais nítidos vislumbres do confronto de valores que acompanhou a emergência do pensamento moderno. Nesse sentido, o livro de Cervantes mantém uma viva atualidade, permitindo comparar, desde ent?o até nossos dias, os níveis do desencontro entre uma vis?o generosa, sublime e heróica do mundo, e outra voltada para os interesses mais imediatos e comezinhos, para os pensamentos mais convencionais e as atitudes mais convenientes.|`|05f96161a53bdc7a144104e0e75afc6caa	Síntese da Obra <br>  <br>        De tanto ler historias de cavalaria, um ingênuo fidalgo espanhol passa a acreditar piamente nos efeitos heróicos dos cavaleiros medievais e decide se tornar, ele também, um cavaleiro andante. Para tanto, recorre a uma armadura enferrujada que fora de seu bisav?, confecciona uma viseira de papel?o e se auto-intitula Dom Quixote de La Mancha. Como todo cavaleiro, ele precisa de uma dama a quem honrar. Elege ent?o uma lavradora que só conhece de vista e a chama de Dulcinéia.Depois de tomar essas providências, monta em seu decrépito cavalo Rocinante e foge de casa em busca de aventuras. <br>  <br>        Após um dia inteiro de caminhada sob o sol, depara com uma estalagem, que em sua mente perturbada se converte num castelo, onde pede para ser ordenado cavaleiro pelo estalajadeiro, que quase n?o consegue conter o riso. No dia seguinte, ao investir contra o grupo de comerciantes que vê como adversários, cai de rocinante e tem seu corpo moído por pauladas. Um conhecido da aldeia encontra o cavaleiro, entre gemidos e lamentos, e o conduz novamente à sua casa.Seguindo aos conselhos do Pe. Tomás e do barbeiro Nicolau, a ama e a sobrinha queimam seus livros e lacram a porta da biblioteca. <br>  <br>        Enquanto todos acham que a estratégia da destrui??o dos livros havia sido um sucesso, Dom Quixote, pensando tratar-se de uma magia de algum cruel feiticeiro, resolve voltar à aventura, agora acompanhado do escudeiro Sancho Pan?a: um ingênuo e materialista lavrador, que aceita seguir o fidalgo pela promessa de uma ilha para governar. <br>  <br>        As viagens se sucedem sob a alucina??o de quem está vivendo no tempo da cavalaria. Em suas andan?as, Dom Quixote encontra moinho de vento que confunde com gingantes. Arremete contra um dos moinhos, cujas pás, devido a um vento mais forte, lan?am o cavaleiro para longe.O escudeiro socorre seu mestre. Dom Quixote n?o dando o bra?o a torcer, diz que o feiticeiro, ao notar que o cavaleiro estava vencendo, transformou os gigantes em moinhos. <br>  <br>        Mas adiante confundindo dois rebanhos de carneiros com exército de inimigos, avan?a contra os animais e mais uma vez é surrado, pelos pastores; além de ser pisoteado pelas ovelhas. No ch?o em meio ao estrume dos animais, ferido e desdentado, recebe do escudeiro a alcunha de O Cavaleiro da Triste Figura. <br>  <br>        No desejo de combater as injusti?as do mundo e homenagear sua dama, o nobre e patético personagem segue viagem enfrentando situa??es supostamente perigosas e sempre radículas: imagina gigantes em rodas-d`águas; vê um cavaleiro de elmo dourado em um barbeiro; ajuda criminosos a fugirem, pensando estar libertando escravos. De suas desventuras, restam-lhes sempre os enganos, as surras, as pedradas e as pauladas. <br>  <br>        à beira da estrada, o cavaleiro da triste figura e seu fiel escudeiro encontram abrigo e deparam com o Pe. Tomás e o barbeiro Nicolau, amigos da aldeia onde moram e que est?o à sua procura. Os dois convencem Sancho a ajudá-los e acabam levando, mais uma vez, e agora enjaulado, Dom Quixote para casa. Lá, cansado doente e abatido pelos reveses e pelas surras que levara, o fidalgo sossega. Até receber a visita do bacharel Sans?o, que traz consigo um livro narrando As estranha aventuras de Dom Quixote. Com a fama, o cavaleiro tem seu espírito aventureiro revigorado e mais uma vez, convencendo Sancho Pan?a a companhá-lo, parte para a estrada, ainda guiado pelo amor de Dulcinéia, e pelo desejo de vencer o perverso feiticeiro e, com ele, as injusti?as do mundo. <br>  <br>        Em Toboso, à procura de sua amada, Dom Quixote encontra três lavradoras montadas em asnos, carregando repolhos para o mercado. Sancho diz que se trata de Dulcinéia e suas damas de companhia, tentando convencer Dom Quixote. Ao se ajoelhar diante de sua sonhada dama, o cavaleiro leva uma repolhada na cabe?a. Sancho diz se tratar de um anel de esmeralda enfeiti?ado em repolho, e Dom Quixote guarda a “prenda” na bolsa, duvidoso, todavia satisfeito. <br>  <br>        Disfar?ado em cavaleiro dos Espelhos, o baixinho Sans?o desafia Dom Quixote, no intuito de levá-lo para casa e, com isso, agradar a sobrinha do fidalgo. Mas, traído por seu cavalo, que prefere comer grama ao duelar, perde o combate. Adiante, Dom Quixote encontra um duque e uma duquesa que, por já terem lido o livro com suas aventuras, resolvem se divertir à custa da dupla: disfar?ado em feiticeiro Merlin, o duque inventa um suposto cavalo mágico de madeira que levaria Dom Quixote até o perverso feiticeiro. Vendam o cavaleiro e o escudeiro sobre a “mágica montaria” e chacoalham o cavalinho de balan?o, enquanto os dois pensam estar voando. Ao atear fogo no rabo do cavalo, recheados de fogos de artifício, o cavaleiro e o escudeiro s?o lan?ados à distancia. <br>  <br>        Seguindo viagem, com mais alguns arranh?es, Dom Quixote e Sancho Pan?a ouvem um grito assustador, é o cavaleiro da lua cheia (na verdade, San??o, agora mais bem preparado e decidido). Que desafia O cavaleiro da Triste Figura: quem perder o combate terá de p?r fim à sua vida de cavaleiro andante. San??o vence, o fidalgo volta ao lar. No final da história, recuperando a raz?o, Dom Quixote renuncia aos romances de cavalaria e morre como um piedoso crist?o. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Abra?os<br>  @

If you DO read it, you will be successful in your report if you give it an honest effort.<br>  <br>  I do that too.

0LgpcOBDaa	as said, both will give the same degree of close up, however, the 100mm will give more working distance between the end of the lens and the subject. you wont be - in your own way, and in your own light - as much, with the longer focal length lens.<br>  <br>  there is one small factor tho, hardly worth mentioning, and that is perspective. the angle of coverage will be slightly different, so slight as to be hardly seen, but it will be there.<br>  <br>  the other factors are the shorter lens will offer wider angle's of view when use as a 50mm and the 100 or 105 will of course be more telephoto, in any shot, and may not be as useful as a general purpose lens as the 50 could.. macros make great "regular" lenses too, very flat fields generally, from corner to corner.<br>  <br>  I have and use 2 such lenses. a 60mm and a 120mm.<br>  <br>  bob - tucson|`|pZGLhV2Waa	They both have 1:1 magnification but the 100mm will allow you to be further away from your subject and get the same shot.|`|kVWJuytvaa	both have 1:1 Magnification if you're buying lens from the camera body manufacturer. 100mm is way closer.

You really have to pre-programme it as if you try to drive it live, it will be near-impossible because you don't have the fine control that you need - it just can't be done.  And, if it's pre-programmed, your actor has to follow exactly the same path, to the inch, EVERY SINGLE TIME.  And for 99.9% of actors, this is just not possible.  I've managed to make it work once, and that was purely because the actor's movements were restricted by the set - he HAD to follow the same path or else he would have fallen off the set.  Even then, it took a long, long time to get the programming right and that was for a simple 10-second sequence.  If you're talking about having someone driving it with a joystick on a controller (which do exist, but are pretty uncommon), why not just have a person operating a followspot?  You don't even need a full-blown followspot, I don't know how many times I've operated a profile spot with an iris fitted, mounted on a stand (using a spigot) as a followspot - works perfectly for a smaller show.  If you're absolutely determined to have an automated followspot, you need to investigate tracking systems where the actor wears a transmitter and there is a receiver mounted on the followspot, but they're horrendously expensive and not all that accurate yet - give it a few years and maybe it will be better.  There's a good reason that West End and Broadway shows still have human followspot operators - why don't you want to use a person?

AA11605131	Not at first, because Bella was just consentrating on how to get away from Alice and Jasper and James told her to go to her house at first.  After she got to her house then James called her and told her to go to the ballet studio.  I assume then Alice would have had a vision of Bella in the dance studio.  Edward would then have read her mind when he got off the plane and they would have gone straight there (after stealing a car of course.)|`|vsbSTSINaa	yuh, because thats how Alice knew where to find her.|`|RjyNInW6aa	No. It says that bella said that it was her old ballet school room. <br>  <br>  <br>  I can't believe I just answered a Twilight question!

suxCcXkAaa	It's really how you, personally, interpret the play. On the one hand, Shakespeare uses a lot of negative Jewish stereotypes to define Shylock, while most of his characters are openly anti-Semitic anyway. But then again, Shakespeare paints Shylock as not necessarily a figure of all-evil--he raises a lot of interesting questions about the nature of "justice" and Shylock speaks some of the most poignant speeches in the play, esp. that gorgeous one in Act III. Check out the link below to read up more on that debate on anti-Semitism--it'll shed a lot of light!|`|DvToP5h7aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Don't know.<br>  <br>  No.<br>  <br>  ============================<br>  <br>  <br>  The Merchant of Venice<br>  <br>  Christians, Not Jews, Are The Real Villains in The Merchant of Venice.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/xMerchantof.html#Anti-Semitism" rel="nofollow">http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/xMerc...</a><br>  <br>  Anti-Semitism in England<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/xMerchantof.html#anti" rel="nofollow">http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/xMerc...</a><br>  <br>  Character Analysis of Shylock<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.articlemyriad.com/character_analysis_shylock_merchant_venice_shakespeare.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.articlemyriad.com/character_a...</a><br>  <br>  ============================<br>  <br>  Merchant of Venice study guides <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/merchant/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/me...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/xMerchantof.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/xMerc...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.william-shakespeare.info/shakespeare-play-merchant-of-venice.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.william-shakespeare.info/shak...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/william-shakespeare/the-merchant-of-venice.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/w...</a>

LEp7IFdvaa	If you've read all three books, the key word here is "student"...one who learns by seeking knowledge. In any event, here is some info to start you on your way:<br>  Dante's Lucifer doesn't speak, and appears to suffer as much as the human souls in his realm, whereas Milton's Satan is quite eloquent.  They are both similar in that neither can undo the consequences of their rebellion with God.  Milton's Satan was "angel like", having once been an angel, he still had wings, but was covered in scales, was 21 feet tall and glowing eyes...and had only one head.  Dante's Lucifer, on the other hand, was a puss filled demon with three heads, and in each mouth was the soul of the damned. Milton's hell was flames and darkness; Dante's was pain, suffering and cold.<br>  The comparison between the hells invisioned between Milton and Marlow goes like this: Milton's depiction of Satan and hell is such that both the reader and Satan are aware that Hell is not a good place to be, but that it's better to rule in hell than serve in heaven.  Therefore Milton's Satan is still connected to the good he once was and appears a pitiful creature worthy of at least a little sympathy.  Marlow's devil is just the opposite, one who uses trickery and deception to get souls; one who is truly evil incarnate.  Marlow's hell enjoys the suffering of the lost souls, whereas Milton's Satan tries to comfort them with pity and promises that some day they may be forgiven.  Milton's satan is driven by pride, whereas Marlow's is driven by a need to do harm and generate pain.<br>  <br>  I hope this gets you started.
R5UIMBvcaa	Fashions in literature come and go.  Dickens and Jane Austen are perennially popular, but they're not always considered the best.  Similarly, Thackeray's Vanity Fair used to be considered in the running for the greatest novel ever written, and I doubt that any literary scholar would consider it quite that great today.  However, I think it's safe to say that all four have firm places in the literary canon.  Maybe it's just that Dickens and Jane Austen are more fun to read, because they're so upbeat.  Things turn out well for the good  characters.  Hardy's likable characters are all too often chewed up and spat out by Fate, and Thackeray's likable characters are simply very few!|`|JS3Zy6ASaa	I've always liked Hardy, though his style is sometimes annoying.<br>  <br>  The only Thackeray I've ever hacked is Vanity Fair.  Loved it on the first reading, though it seemed a bit too preachy on the second.<br>  <br>  I'd put them a bit below the others you mentioned.|`|q33FiROraa	To be honest it's all a matter of opinion. One person might class Hardy as great and Dickens as terrible. I think the proof of their abilities lies in the fact that their work is still in print and considered 'Classics'. From that perspective, you can say that they are among the best of English authors ... the of all time is a bit of a stretch, maybe the best of their era.

It's not easy because thoughts of the past give us our identity and thoughts of the future gives us our hopes and dreams, and the ego likes to hang on to this "security" at all costs.<br>  <br>  Time is an ego concept, it's one of the delusions that keeps us separated from Eternity and from our true identity.|`|trMsK86jaa	Perhaps for the simple reason that the subconscious mind lacks the sensory input in order to judge relative timescales.<br>  <br>  Which raises an interesting point in itself - it's entirely possible that there are things in this reality (perhaps others) which the human mind simply cannot perceive or sense in any way.<br>  <br>  Obviously you can sense an awful lot of things - heat, pressure, balance, etc - those aren't even listed on the five senses everyone considers so empirically important.<br>  <br>  It would be feasible, perhaps, that a manifestation of human evolution could be an extra sense.<br>  <br>  But this is all inherently illogical and i'm just speculating really that somehow we all developed these senses at some point - i sincerely doubt we were able to see, hear, smell and touch all at once from the beginning of evolution.|`|b9dae40ef8a10998c029b6d46aa0359daa	There is still the perception of time though.

The passage of time is only an illusion. We use time only as a tool for discriminating between events.

It is ALL in the observer's mind.|`|SDiYtubGaa	You have based your question upon 'how man perceives time during dreams, sleep...'. Isn't dream a human imagination?

NqfUPKiSaa	Only one God<br>  Edit; whatever conception of god we have of God, it does not influence our daily life and conduct-life does not find an inspiration from it, <br>  God may be Infinite, Omnipresent, Omniscient, personal and Merciful -but these conceptions are not compelling to make us try to know Him in our busy life.<br>  The very conception of God should make us seek Him|`|QCejFqXgaa	Blessings. Good Question for the Believer of all faith.....The concept of the oneness of God to put it in a nutshell is Omnipotence that is, there is nothing outside God. God is everywhere at all time in the past the present and the future simultaneously. There is nothing out side of God. GOD IS the creation.This bring us to the point that every thing is God because god is everything. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  God is Oneness, One without second, pure Being, not separate. God includes everything, and allows all to be. Without God, nothing exists, so all that exists is the Oneness. It's only an illusion of separation, an illusion of not Oneness, this is what is needed to be seen through. Through the illusion, this and that is seen, this and that is wanted or not wanted, but through Oneness, nothing is lacking. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Many sources, including Ra, Edgar Cayce, and others, say that the Oneness essentially got bored or lonely. It needed to do something. It needed to create. It wasn't feeling complete just by having this unified consciousness all the time. <br>  So it conceptualized the idea of breaking Itself up into all these parts, knowing that the parts would be able to evolve by their own free will, making their own decisions. Things would happen that the Oneness was not yet able to understand or comprehend. The parts would have essentially their own creative ability. They would be Co-Creators. <br>  The Great Plan was that at the end, after this entire cycle of universal evolution was complete, all of the parts that had evolved on their own would independently recognize their God Consciousness, renounce separation, embrace unity, and return to the totality of Oneness. The One Creator from that very fact would be highly enhanced, because all of this wonderful creative stuff had transpired in that transition from ''One'' to ''many'' and back to ''One. <br>  So God is evolving, and not some static Being that just sits there and waits for everybody to catch up. God is experiencing our evolution with us. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It is too easy to separate ourselves from god. God is not evolving with us because we are god evolving, when that evolution ends all will be complete and realise all. This is a bit of a scary thought. It means that we are all the same individual and when this realisation is finally realised it means that individuality is the ultimate illusion. <br>  <br>  <br>  Helpful Scriptures about the Oneness of-God.....Deuteronomy 6:4 "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one Lord. <br>  <br>  Ephesians 4:5 "one Lord, one faith, one baptism." <br>  <br>  John 10:30 "I and the Father are One." <br>  <br>  Matt. 28:19 Baptizing in the NAME of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. <br>  <br>  Acts 2:38 - Revelation of the name..Baptizing in the Name of Jesus. <br>  <br>  Comforter which is the Holy Ghost is coming in the Name of Jesus. (John 14:26 <br>  <br>  <br>  I believe God is Jesus - Jesus is the fully revealed name of God.

It could mean that only one truth exists, although many roads may lead to it and more than one way to look at it may be at the disposal of others.  It probably means that equality rather than hierarchy has to be achieved.  Co-operation to work for a unified good can effectuate overall growth, but competition, which often results in rivalry and fighting, can only reduce one entity.<br>  <br>  Knowledge, for example, exists as a whole, and it is not really divided into disciplines and specialities over which some individuals hold a monopoly.  Religion and science are not separate or antagonistic to one another to the extent that both fields of knowledge represent the truth as parts of the whole.

It may seem like a dream come true to some, but their lives can morph into a living nightmare at any time--like when Angel, the youngest member of the "Flock," is kidnapped and taken back to the "School" where she and the others were genetically engineered by sinister scientists. Her friends brave a journey to blazing hot Death Valley, CA, to save Angel, but soon enough, they find themselves in yet another nightmare--this one involving fighting off the half-human, half-wolf "Erasers" in New York City. Whether in the treetops of Central Park or in the bowels of the Manhattan subway system, Max and her adopted family take the ride of their lives.

This site is full of hypocrisy... much like the world it inhabits.  You see, it is considered acceptable to offend and lie if you have enough 'friends', i.e. people who  support you because, like them, you amount to zero.  If, on the other hand, you take an opposing view, and lack that herd of sheople bleating behind you, you're a troll.  That's hypocrisy, might makes right.  Nonsense.  When I come here, I expect to hear a lot of people who cannot spell, resort to cussing because they cannot form and express an articulate opinion, and who have the gang mentality... oh, and the poetry sucks too.

9233401496ab10d52d1644174696a803aa	In May 1950, President Harry S. Truman authorized a modest program of economic and military aid to the French, who were fighting to retain control of their Indochina colony, including Laos and Cambodia as well as Vietnam. When the Vietnamese Nationalist (and Communist-led) Vietminh army defeated French forces at Dienbienphu in 1954, the French were compelled to accede to the creation of a Communist Vietnam north of the 17th parallel while leaving a non-Communist entity south of that line. The United States refused to accept the arrangement. The administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower undertook instead to build a nation from the spurious political entity that was South Vietnam by fabricating a government there, taking over control from the French, dispatching military advisers to train a South Vietnamese army, and unleashing the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to conduct psychological warfare against the North.<br>  <br>  President John F. Kennedy rounded another turning point in early 1961, when he secretly sent 400 Special Operations Forces-trained (Green Beret) soldiers to teach the South Vietnamese how to fight what was called counterinsurgency war against Communist guerrillas in South Vietnam. When Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963, there were more than 16,000 U.S. military advisers in South Vietnam, and more than 100 Americans had been killed. Kennedy's successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, committed the United States most fully to the war. In August 1964, he secured from Congress a functional (not actual) declaration of war: the Tonkin Gulf Resolution. Then, in February and March 1965, Johnson authorized the sustained bombing, by U.S. aircraft, of targets north of the 17th parallel, and on 8 March dispatched 3,500 Marines to South Vietnam. Legal declaration or no, the United States was now at war.Eisenhower acknowledged that, had elections been held as scheduled in Vietnam in 1956, "Ho Chi Minh would have won 80% of the vote"--and no U.S. president wanted to lose a country to communism. Democrats in particular, like Kennedy and Johnson, feared a right-wing backlash should they give up the fight; they remembered vividly the accusatory tone of the Republicans' 1950 question, "Who lost China?" <br>  The youthful John Kennedy, on the other hand, felt he had to prove his resolve to the American people and his Communist adversaries, especially in the aftermath of several foreign policy blunders early in his administration. Lyndon Johnson saw the Vietnam War as a test of his mettle, as a Southerner and as a man. He exhorted his soldiers to "nail the coonskin to the wall" in Vietnam, likening victory to a successful hunting expedition. When Johnson began bombing North Vietnam and sent the Marines to South Vietnam in early 1965, he had every intention of fighting a limited war. He and his advisers worried that too lavish a use of U.S. firepower might prompt the Chinese to enter the conflict. It was not expected that the North Vietnamese and the NLF would hold out long against the American military. And yet U.S. policymakers never managed to fit military strategy to U.S. goals in Vietnam. Massive bombing had little effect against a decentralized economy like North Vietnam's. Kennedy had favored counterinsurgency warfare in the South Vietnamese countryside, and Johnson endorsed this strategy, but the political side of counterinsurgency--the effort to win the "hearts and minds" of the Vietnamese peasantry-- was at best underdeveloped and probably doomed. Presidents proved reluctant to mobilize American society to the extent the generals thought necessary to defeat the enemy.<br>  <br>  As the United States went to war in 1965, a few voices were raised in dissent. Within the Johnson administration, Undersecretary of State George Ball warned that the South Vietnamese government was a functional nonentity and simply could not be sustained by the United States, even with a major effort. Antiwar protest groups formed on many of the nation's campuses; in June, the leftist organization Students for a Democratic Society decided to make the war its principal target. But major dissent would not begin until 1966 or later. By and large in 1965, Americans supported the administration's claim that it was fighting to stop communism in Southeast Asia, or people simply shrugged and went about their daily lives, unaware that this gradually escalating war would tear American society apart. It was 1967 and the passage of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution that the war really was stepped up and massive troop build up became enormous. Gulf of Tonkin was a resolution over a minor sea incident that Johnson had deliberately overblown to get passage to allow for the massive build up.

Don't go too detailed and don't be afraid of putting your own twist on the painting, meaning don't try to make it look exactly as you see it since watercolor often has a mind of its own and it'll frustrate you. Use plenty of water, that's my biggest advice.

b0f0f231555e5da9d455a8890388f3cbaa	When I was around 7 or 8 (1950 era) my friends and I would climb all over the framework of multistory apartments being built nearby. The security guard (a black WWII wounded veteran) named TC would yell at us to come down, then he would pile us into the bed of his pickup truck and drive to his nearby trailer where his wife Alicia would feed us milk and fresh baked cookies as TC told us his war stories. Two nicer people never lived.<br>  Then I would go home where my parents constantly talked about how bad and inferior blacks were.<br>  God Bless TC and Alicia for showing me and my friends that discrimination is for the ignorant.

A florist delivered a beautiful plant from distant friends of the family that heard the news.  Just a simple gesture on their part.  I have been dividing that plant every year now, and my house is full of the offshoots, a reminder that life goes on.|`|HpWujntlaa	Once my father and my brother got in a gigantic argument. It shook me up so much I had to walk out of the house. I spent the entire day walking around my neighborhood trying to figure out what was going on in my home and in my life. Eventually I decided I was going to run away from home. I looked in my wallet. I had seven dollars. I was going to buy what I could at the dollar store and then go. I bought a water bottle, a pocket knife and for reasons I couldn't quite understand at the time, I bought a copy of the bible. <br>  <br>  I began walking, then I stopped in a park. I opened to the first page in the bible and read about how god created the world and Adam and Eve and then I took out my journal and I started writing. I wrote near three or four pages before finally realizing. Perfection doesn't exist. So to be imperfect is to be perfect. My family will always argue but that doesn't mean that they don't love each other or that I don't love them. They are imperfect, which makes them perfect so to look for something better will never do me any good at all. <br>  <br>  I stood up and put all of my things in my bag and walked home, but I was still confused. I was going to talk to a priest on the way home when I passed a church but the church was closed. I laid down on the ground and began to pray. Believe me when I say this, because it's going to sound ridiculous. A man in a white suit with a purple tie walked up to me and was standing above me. He asked me what was wrong. I told him I was confused and I didn't know what to do. He told me "You're still young. Be patient, things will get better." then he dissappeared. <br>  <br>  My family still argues but now I can handle it without getting too upset. All because something influenced me to buy the bible at the dollar store and a man in white told me things will get better.<br>  <br>  It was the most spiritual experience I've ever had in my life.|`|gLp7pvPnaa	My birth, my childhood, my adulthood, these mean nothing to others but are everything to me.

Ue5NoJOgaa	It depends on which culture you are talking about, Emperors in Japan had dogs living in their homes with them 4-5 thousand years ago.

fle8hQrAaa	Well, the last 4 to 5 years will take much longer than the first 3 to 4.  You probably need about 1 year for grade 4, 1 for grade 5, 3 years for grades 6 and 7 (total), and 2 years for grade 8 (optimistically speaking).  That's a lot of work!  Here in Canada, there is also rudiments and theory exams that are necessary to do the upper grades so you need to look at that too.<br>  Of course, if you're willing to work really really hard and practise a lot, you can shrink those times.  It does depend on when the exams are given though.  Here, they are only given about 2-3 times per year so if you're not ready then, then you have to wait...<br>  Good luck!

71qGan9Raa	Hopefully you'll be playing piano your whole life. I'm still practicing and enjoying music. Who cares the level as long as you enjoy the music. If you're not enjoying your music pieces, it's time to switch to something you like. Maybe you like to add Jazz to your playing or contemporary. I think you need to spice up your music selections because I see the level is bothering you. <br>  I've been teaching piano for over 20 years. When my students reach the point you feel, I get rid of the levels and just start playing music from books. I have had students take home all the top prizes at festivals, win the talent shows and school awards. It's amazing what students can do when they enjoy what they do.

Do it slow and if you screw up start that section over again.<br>  This is my warm up, I play it very fast, but it works the same slow.<br>  Pick open, then 1st fret , 2nd, 3rd and then go up the next string and do it. Desend going in reverse, 3-2-1- open. After you get to the bottom, start one fret over, so: 1-2-3-4, 4-3-2-1.....2-3-4-5, 5-4-3-2.<br>  <br>  Find an easy chord songs such as Smoke on the Water and Time is Running Out by Muse. You can or dont have to play the power chords with them, just single notes. But its good to get a rhythm instilled.|`|AA10656876	there are many guitar tips and tutorials on youtube, look it up..|`|O05HQLohaa	You are a great example of why to take lessons.

It will be difficult, but with time it will get easier and your handwriting will improve. You will gain better control over the dyspraxia.|`|AA11396388	Like you, I had problems with my co-ordination through childhood and adolescence.  I was born 1959, so dyspraxia was never diagnosed.  I was helped a bit with my writing in my early teens which at least made it readable.  I seemed to gradually improve as I have got older. My writing is not pretty but it is always readable now and I can type anywhere between 40-60 words per minute, pretty good for someone like me.  What I do know is practise doesn't make the problem go away but can make it a bit better.  I don't think even now I would have the co ordination to do some complex things.  You have to accept your limitations, but don't get discouraged.  Trying twice as hard to get half as far wont get you applause from a feckless society but the satisfaction is enormous.  Good Luck in everything you do. <br>  <br>  I forgot to mention, I wrote something that has been used in films, TV and all kind of things.  Infact I've become quite well known for my writing.

Learning guitar may be a good idea because, unlike the violin, you don't have to worry about using a bow, and it's possible to strum along with a simple song with only 3 chords, which would give you the confidence to carry on and progress further.  I do hope you're successful, as music is wonderful and being able to actually play an instrument gives great satisfaction to the musician, as well as pleasure to others.

I still have the book and read it to my kids, and can safely rec'd you to either watch the movie or read Chris' books.|`|11iSImkzaa	It's actually Christopher Paolini and here are the books in order:<br>  Eragon<br>  Eldest<br>  Brisingr<br>  The books are absolutely great. If you are a fan of Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings, you should definitely read this series. <br>  *A Basic Overview of the Books*<br>  It all starts in Palancar Valley. An elf named Arya has stolen a dragon egg from the evil King Galbatorix. She and her friends are attacked by the Shade and the Ra'zac. Arya then sends the egg to the Spine mountains, where a boy named Eragon finds it. Eragon becomes a Dragon Rider when the egg hatches. He named the dragon Saphira.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|A4b5VaFvaa	Eragon <br>  Eldest<br>  Brisingr<br>  yes they are very good and the story is about a boy named Eragon who one day is hunting in the Spine (the forrest) and happens upon what he thinks is a blue stone but then turns out to be an egg and he gets a blue dragon who he names Saphira and finds out he is a lengendary Dragon Rider the next two (Eldest and Brisingr) are just the exrtended tale of Eragons quest i highly recommmend these books there awesome|`|Tkno91Wwaa	Do you mean Christopher Paolini? He wrote the Inheritance series, which includes Eragon, Eldest, and Brisingr. They made a movie out of Eragon a couple years ago, but it sucked compared to the book.

These are great fantasy novels, and they're based in an imaginary world.|`|hSHlL7Zxaa	he wrote the inheritance cycle which consists of Eragon, Eldest, and Brisingr, and he is currently writing the 4th and final book, Empire. There is also Eragon the movie, but like most film adaptions from books, it cut a lot out of it. They are about a boy, Eragon, who finds a dragon egg which hatches, Saphira, and their quest to free Alagasia(the fantasty place they take place in) from Galbatorix(evil king) rule (I don't think I spelled the names right) I'm in high school, and my 7th grade brother made me read them, and for the audience they are targeting (middle school), they were good.

Even more so considering Paolini's age; I believe he is only 25 years old and already he has published three full length, best selling novels.<br>  <br>  I enjoyed the books, though I found them suited more to a younger audience; around 13-20.<br>  <br>  His influences are plainly obvious when reading the book, and he does well to emulate his idols without plagiarising or being unoriginal.

The other basic context involves the strategy Eisenhower employed to wage the Cold War. While not the author of that strategy, he inherited, modified, and sustained what would arguably be the most successful diplomatic initiative of the twentieth century.<br>  <br>  As president, Eisenhower was determined to reverse the trend he saw in U.S. domestic policy toward greater federal involvement in the affairs of the states, localities, and private citizens. Not all who received help were poor or powerless. He began to collect information on domestic policy and formulate his own concept of a domestic program. Eisenhower advocated a balanced budget, sought a low rate of inflation, and wanted a rate of growth that was sustainable over the long term. "Under conditions of high peace time prosperity," he said, "we can never justify going further into debt to give ourselves a tax cut at the expense of our children." Many Republican congressmen disagreed. The intra- and inter-party struggles over fiscal moderation were fierce, but in 1956 and 1957 the administration managed to balance the budget--a feat matched only one time since 1960.

The phenomenon was caused by severe drought coupled with decades of extensive farming without crop rotation or other techniques to prevent erosion. Deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains had killed the natural grasses that normally kept the soil in place and trapped moisture even during periods of drought and high winds.<br>  <br>  During the drought of the 1930s, with no natural anchors to keep the soil in place, it dried, turned to dust, and blew away eastward and southward in large dark clouds. At times the clouds blackened the sky reaching all the way to East Coast cities such as New York and Washington, D.C. Much of the soil ended up deposited in the Atlantic Ocean. These immense dust storms–given names such as "Black Blizzards" and "Black Rollers"–often reduced visibility to a few feet (around a meter). The Dust Bowl affected 100,000,000 acres (400,000 km2), centered on the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma, and adjacent parts of New Mexico, Colorado, and Kansas  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl</a> -------------------<br>    This settlement led to the near-extinction of the bison and the removal of the Native Americans to Indian reservations in the 1870s. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_plains#Pioneer_settlement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_pla...</a> Much of the Great Plains became open range, hosting ranching operations where anyone was theoretically free to run cattle. In the spring and fall, roundups were held and the new calves were branded and the cattle sorted out for sale. Ranching began in Texas and gradually moved northward. Texas cattle were driven north to railroad lines in cities Dodge City, Kansas and Ogallala, Nebraska; from there, cattle were shipped eastward. Many foreign, especially British, investors financed the great ranches of the era. Overstocking of the range and the terrible winter of 1886 eventually resulted in a disaster, with many cattle starved and frozen. From then onward, ranchers generally turned to raising feed in order to winter their cattle over.<br>  <br>  The Homestead Act of 1862 provided that a settler could claim up to 160 acres (65 hectares) of land, provided that he lived on it for a period of five years and cultivated it. This was later expanded under the Kinkaid Act to include a homestead of an entire section. Hundreds of thousands of people claimed these homesteads, sometimes building sod houses out of the very turf of their land. Many of them were not skilled dryland farmers and failures were frequent. Germans from Russia who had previously farmed in similar circumstances in what is now Ukraine were marginally more successful than the average homesteader. <br>  <br>   After 1900<br>    The region roughly centered on the Oklahoma Panhandle, including southeastern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, the Texas Panhandle, and extreme northeastern New Mexico was known as the Dust Bowl during the late 1920s and early 1930s. The effect of the drought combined with the effects of the Great Depression, forced many farmers off the land throughout the Great Plains.<br>  <br>  From the 1950s, on, many areas of the Great Plains have become productive crop-growing areas because of extensive irrigation. The southern portion of the Great Plains lies over the Ogallala Aquifer, a vast underground layer of water-bearing strata dating from the last ice age. Center pivot irrigation is used extensively in drier sections of the Great Plains, resulting in aquifer depletion at a rate that is greater than the ground's ability to recharge.<br>  <br>  The rural Plains have lost a third of their population since 1920. Several hundred thousand square miles of the Great Plains have fewer than six persons per square mile—the density standard Frederick Jackson Turner used to declare the American frontier "closed" in 1893. Many have fewer than two persons per square mile. There are more than 6,000 ghost towns in the State of Kansas alone, according to Kansas historian Daniel Fitzgerald. This problem is often exacerbated by the consolidation of farms and the difficulty of attracting modern industry to the region. In addition, the smaller school-age population has forced the consolidation of school districts and the closure of high schools in some communities. This continuing population loss has led some to suggest that the current use of the drier parts of the Great Plains is not sustainable, and propose that large parts be restored to native grassland grazed by bison, a proposal known as Buffalo Commons.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_plains#Pioneer_settlement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_pla...</a>|`|1c3c1bf8b2165db543cc5709bc6b02c5aa	A big part of the problem has to do with farmers from the south and east moving onto the plains and bringing with them pre-conceived ideas of how to farm.  A different climate and a different soil ecology required different methods, but many tried to farm exactly as they had "back home."  Part of the failure rate was simply a failure to adapt.|`|YRRXtVXeaa	GOVERNMEENT WOULD NOT HELP AND ALSO BAD WEATHER

What we can know is what the White Whale symbolizes in the minds of the various characters.

You could not tie your own trout flies if you were blind. If you are dying to take a stab at genealogy, you could research your adopted parents' lines.<br>  <br>  You would start with them and work back, one generation at a time. <br>  <br>  A word of warning, though - genealogy is very similar to doing a term paper in a high school history class; it involves a lot of research. It is an academic hobby. Your spelling and punctuation tell me you either don't like school work or are not very good at it; maybe both. You probably wouldn't like genealogy.|`|AA12343309	Start off with yours and your parents' birth certificates.  If your parents are dead their death certificates also will probably have useful information.<br>  <br>  My answer is lengthy and I apologize for that but I want to warn you of the advantages and the pitfalls of genealogy on the internet. We get your question many time a day. So I have cut and am pasting an answer. <br>  <br>  Here is a link to various websites, some free, some not<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.progenealogists.com/top50genealogy2008.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.progenealogists.com/top50gene...</a><br>  <br>  Websites that only have family trees are not worth a tinker's curse unless you are willing to verify the information with documents/records. They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.<br>  <br>  Right before Christmas of 2008, I found out I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1957. It was the same year Hurricane Audrey hit in our part of the world. Hey! we had been dead for 51 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!<br>  <br>  I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.<br>  <br>  This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.<br>  <br>  Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family trees.<br>  <br>  CyndisList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.<br>  <br>  Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.<br>  <br>  However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.<br>  <br>  Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.<br>  <br>  A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.<br>  <br>  They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know. Just call the nearest Mormon Church or visit their free website, FamilySearch.org, to get their hours for the general public.<br>  <br>  Rootsweb and FamilySearch.org are 2 free sites but remember verify information in family trees with documents/records. If you don't you don't know whether it is accurate or not.|`|9c7c4192016169baf847ee7ae4705422aa	The Mormons have a very good ancestry database.

70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	Nationalism began in the Napoleonic Era and it was when people started identifying themselves with their country as opposed to their village or clan.  Napoleon used national banner and flag to rally people behind a common cause so they would fight not for their own lands, properties, titles, or benefits, but for the common benefits of all of the nation.<br>  <br>  This rise in Nationalism in Europe led to a division within the European countries and was one of the contributing factors in why World War One escalated the way it did.<br>  <br>  Nationalism is still very prevalent in Western societies today, including America.  Contrary to some perceptions, Nationalism does not equate to Patriotism, Communism, Socialism, or Nazism.  It is simply associating yourself with your nation as opposed to your family, your clan, your village, your race, or your religion.|`|HQKuzxulaa	All I can offer is a quote : "A Patriot loves his Country, a Nationalist hates everybody else's".|`|wfwdQ7bcaa	Nationalism is love of your country and willingness to sacrifice for it.

If you have to spend less, do the best that you can. You might do best purchasing a used one so that you can obtain the highest quality for your money. Seagull, Ibanez, Takamine and so on. there are many good ones to choose from. <br>  Yes, you can play both, but you need to select Instruments that conform to your needs. (hands, body size, etc). <br>  There is  more information to get you started. If you want to know more email me.|`|Yoo29boQaa	I'd start with an acoustic guitar. While they're slightly more difficult to play, you'll build additional hand strength from playing the acoustic, and the electric guitar will feel like a toy after some regular practicing.<br>  <br>  The acoustic and electric are tuned the same with identical chord positions; however, the techniques for rock guitar (power chords, palm muting, pinch harmonics, double-stop bends) don't render as well on the acoustic, so you'll need to add them to your repertoire should you decide to play rock music.<br>  <br>  Not to worry though... a solid foundation on the acoustic will take you a long way. I'd suggest starting by learning home chords and basic rhythm. From there you can add to your skills as you see fit. You're definitely not too old to learn. I started at 13, and I've been playing for 16 years. Mastering the guitar is a lifetime journey that you can travel at any pace. How long it takes you to learn to play just depends on what your goals are. Strumming some basic songs can be learned in just a few weeks. Within a few months of steady practice, you should feel relatively confident with basic chords as muscle memory will set in.<br>  <br>  An introductory instrument should cost around $300. Find a decent brand and if you can, play it before you buy. An uncomfortable instrument has discouraged many a student, so it's important to find a guitar that feels right. For lessons, you can look around for local instructors or maybe even ask a friend to show you some basics. There are also a good number of introductory videos on youtube that are worth checking out. Just remember, practice makes perfect, and don't get discouraged if you don't sound like a rock god the first week.
