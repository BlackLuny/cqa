20090128211413AAfhLrE	Consumer Electronics;Camcorders	What is good camcorder for a mac user?	Hello everyone,    I am a total newbie in terms of imovie and video recording.  So my question is: what camcorder is easy to use with a macbook from your experience? Something that is not very large in size (I am a petite girl), that can produce a video in a format that is easy to edit, with decent quality (maybe even HD), no tapes, either flash or hard drive memory. I would need a device that could work well outside, in sunny and windy areas (like a beach) as well as in low light situations such at dusk or artificial lighting outside.   A big plus would be if also sturdy...I snowboard in my spare time and there is a lot of material I'd like to catch on tape i.e. my friend plowing face down into a pile of snow :D  Thanks a bunch,

Hi, I was wanting to connect my Wii to my desktop through my TV tuner and I wasn't too sure of exactly how to do it.       Here is my current desktop setup: These are the relevant parts      - Dell SP2208WFP Monitor (22 inch, 1680x1050 resoution, 60 Hz refresh rate)      - Nvidia 9800 GX2 graphics card (2 DVI Ports, 1 HDMI Port)       http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...       - Hauppauge WinTV HVR 1800 (S-Video/ Composite Video In, Left and Right Audio In)       http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...

How would I create that input channel in Media Center or if not that, what software do I use to recieve that input through the tuner to display it on my monitor?      Any help would be greatly appreciated!

20090225154859AAzAqX2	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Left 4 Dead, Street Fighter 4 or Fallout 3?	I'm planning to get a new game for my Xbox this weekend, I already have Xbox live with Gears 2, Halo 3, Call of  duty 4 and Far cry 2. Now i got bored of those 4 and now im planning to get a new game. Im practically bored and i want a game that will last me a long time. Im also kinda sick of multiplayer games cuz all  the games i play are multiplayer. right now im leaning on Fallout 3 cuz it god many good review and i really liked oblivion made by bethesda.  so one of my friends recommended Left 4 Dead,  they tell me that Left 4 Dead is good when u play with ur friends and my friends are VERY good at L4D but the thing is that again, its a multiplayer game and the game doesnt have much variety but they tell me that when us 4 play its VERY fun. i agree. but we all wont be on at the same time and yea.... my other friend recommended SF4 and ive been a LONGTIME fan of street fighter and im exceptionally good at the game. the thing is that i know it's one of those games where i will always be practicing that one combo with that one guy and it will piss me oofff soo much and i will eventually get bored of it and yeaaa. Last, my other friend recommended me Fallout 3 and i think that this is perfect, it last long, there are a lot of things to explore, buy and find. and it will keep me busy for a long time. I m leaning on fallout 3 BUT IM NOT SURE so please answer this and give me some advice, i would preferably like it if you played the game your recommended cuz  i dont want to take a shot in the dark. Thanks and please answer.   p.s. my gamertag is Death of a Noob in case u wanna play together some time, im a immortal god at halo 3 and call of duty 4.
20090225155419AAiC8sE	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Heeelp! iPod isn't syncing.?	My iPod won't sync. I've tried several things to get it to work and received errors number 124, 48, 53, 69, and 1537. It's an iPod classic 80GB and I got it just over a year ago (which is why Apple won't help me at all.) Now, the problem seems to be that I plug in the iPod and hit sync, and for a minute it works and then the display on the iPod switches back to 'Connected,' iTunes freezes, and iPod loses any music it's uploaded so far.   I'm running Windows Vista and the newest version of iTunes. How can I fix my baby?

I lost my cell phone at a mall yesterday...I don't know if I left it in my car or I took it with me...I searched the car and STILL couldn't find it. I called the Information Service place at the mall I was in...but they said they didn't have it...I can't call my phone because it's closed...and I'm thinking of calling the mall again cause they might have it (even thought they said they didn't). I loved my Samsung SJH J-600...=(...what should I do?? I'm dying here!!    I'm pretty sure I left my phone in the car...do you think it probably got knocked out of the car as I was getting out, and I didn't notice? Or maybe it fell out of my pocket.....because I usually keep my phone in my pocket, and it wasn't in there when I was at the mall. I'm SO absent minded I don't know what to do...='(

20090128235354AAs7jPr	Consumer Electronics;Other - Electronics	How do i remove static buzz from my recording?	Before I bought the mic for $7 i had a headset mic, which i recorded with the same program (Mixcraft) and it still had the static and buzz.       Everytime i record with Mixcraft, it has this buzz or static noise while i record and then when i play it, it still has the buzz sound. Is it because of Mixcraft, Microphone, Adapter, or Surrounding noise that is being picked up by the microphone?      The Dynamic microphone is a Memorex Dynamic mic that was bought from Target for $7. It is a large pin 1/4(6.3mm) Mono. (Is the buzz from the mic cause it's cheap?)      I had to connect it to my laptop, so i bought an adapter from Best Buy, it was a small pin (3.5mm) Stereo. (Do i need to connect mono to mono?)      What do you think the problem is?      I tried to cover the mic with 2 socks to filter or silence the surrounding sound, but that didn't help. The static buzz was still there.       It is a contiuious buzz, while i'm recording.      If it had problem with the headset mic and the Dynamic mic then it must either be the surrounding sound or the Mixcraft program.       The headset mic is a small pin (3.5mm) stereo.   The Dynamic mic was a large pin 1/4(6.3mm) mono and it was connected with an adapter with a small pin (3.5mm) stereo.      Do i need to change a setting or something in Mixcraft to remove buzz?

But, I don't know much about fisheye lens. I might be planning on getting a real fisheye lens later in life but right now, I want something to play with and something kind of cheap. So I look on eBay and I see fisheye lens, fisheye converters, and fisheye adapters.     So my question is...  Can anyone help me choose the better one keeping in mind that I'm on a budget and can anyone tell me what's the difference between those converters, adapters, and all those things.     Thanks. Much appreciated.

20090129031603AAjb5yT	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Xbox 360 Microphone issue?	Issue: My mic sensitivity is too low and isn't picking up my voice. I have to brush the mouth piece with my finger to activate it, and keep rubbing it so that it stays active, therefore creating too much noise to be understood.    Using a Xbox 360 wired mic  My mic volume is 10.  It's plugged in all the way.  I've used 2 different headsets, same problem.  The batteries are brand new.    Any ideas?    Thanks!

20090129034635AA5z0t5	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	My Ipod earphones are at different volumes?	My left one plays songs distinctly quieter than the right one...on all songs. It has only recently started doing this.      It has had some harsh treatment...do you reckon is this something that can be fixed or do I need a new set of earphones, they were quite expensive so I'd much prefer a fix...either that or simply live with the quieter left side :(
20090129034329AAv9WXQ	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	DSLR - Changing lens and dust on sensor?	Whenever I change the lens on my DSLR, I switch it off and then change the lens. Various sites suggest the same thing since when the camera is on, there's some charge on the sensor which can attract dust to the sensor (low pass filter).      I was wondering is this really so? The shutter is anyway closed while changing the lens and the charge is not strong enough to attract dust particles (the ones that cause problems) on to the shutter blades.      Can anyone provide a link to some site that has actually proved if this happens or not?

20090129033427AAalwPs	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	How do I make a flash gun wireless?	I recently purchased a flash gun for my Canon 450D (Rebel) I decided to get a flash gun as I want to take some portrait shots and dont like th normal flashes that tend to come out really intense. Anyway I got this one from Jessops     http://www.jessops.com/online.store/cate...    I know it is far from the most expensive, even at its full price of ￡70 it is still al lot cheaper then the speedlight ones etc.   How would I go about making it so that this flash gun would work wirelessly, does it cost a lot? Would I have been better off buying a more expensive flash that maybe already has the wireless parts with it? as you can tell Im a little confused so any help would be appreciated.      Thank You :)
