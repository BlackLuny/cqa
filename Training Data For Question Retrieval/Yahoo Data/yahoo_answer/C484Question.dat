20090202214246AAjC7WD	Health;Other - Health	Does taking a nap count towards sleep at night?	Okay, I never understood fully how this worked..      So last night I slept like 6-7 hours.  I felt perfectly fine all day felt like it was a good amount of sleep. Till later tonight I got really bored sitting around at home and started to get a little tired  so I took a nap, which ended up turning into a 2 hour or so nap.  I woke up feeling awful.  I HATE NAPS forever now and will probably never take one again.  But anyways....        Does that 2 hour nap count towards my sleep tonite?  I feel so groggy and such, but NOT tired anymore. I feel like I "over-slept" and the last thing I want to do is sleep!!  If I sleep only 6 hours tonite, will that 2 hour nap I took add onto the 6 hours of sleep? I honestly cannot picture myself even sleeping tonite, let alone sleeping another full 8 hours because that nap makes me feel like i majorly over-slept already.

20090202214552AAaG9e1	Health;Mental Health	Isit possible for someone to love somebody but be so depressed/self-hating that they think they hate them?	Like the question asked: Is it possible for someone to love somebody but be so depressed and hate themselves from the bottom of their heart that they think they hate the person?      I ask because my best friend is in a relationship with a girl he is madly in love with. This girl fell in head over heals love with him at the beginning of the relationship but as her depression set in its slowly damaging the relationship.      she is depressed almost 24/7 and from the bottom of her heart thinks she is scum and wants to die (but due to religion won't kill herself..just wants to die in her sleep... Don't worry we're working on getting her help but its hard with her state and the economy)      Anyway, she feels like she can't ever fall in love with him again and sometimes can't stand him, but also needs him and can't stand the thought of going even a couple days without talking to him? Is it likely that need a sub-conscious love distorted by all this hate and pain?      Please answer only if you have experience in similar or in the psychology of depressed people.

Well right now I am struggling in school I am not smart if anything I have a low GPA not too mention my major includes things that I like yet I am a C student in all of them. Basically I suck at the things I like, I like to draw but I suck at it, I like computers I'm horrible at it,  want to play the guitar but I can hardly play. The only thing I am good at is games playing them that is. That's it. You see I really want to design web and program yet I'm no good everybody else is but I am not.

So what should I do I don't even have time to see a psychiatrist and my boyfriend doesn't understand me at all because he is happy all the time. Should I die I mean I'm just another useless person for someone to yell at, any suggestions?

20090202215844AAaTzMZ	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Oh No! This is ridiculous...!?	I've been getting these vibrating nerves in my feet (mostly my left but sometimes my right) it's inside it can't be seen, and what feels like a nerve tremor in my my left index finger. The finger doesn't shake or anything, it's just inside it feels like a tremor of a nerve that's intermittent. Also, there's been this feeling in a small part of my right foot on the far right side, when I'm walking, sometimes that part of my foot feels like it's hardening inside. It's a small part. The left foot vibes have been happening for a few months now. I have no pain except the very occasional sharp pain in buttock and there's some medium tolerable pain in my right knee when I bend it. I've made an appointment to see a doctor so please don't say see a doctor, I just want thoughts. Does anyone have an idea as to what this could be? Should I worry...?
20090202215509AAFvhI3	Health;Women's Health	How do you find passion in life?	Right now I'm a 21 year old college student. My major is International Economics/Business, and I'm not really that happy with it. Yeah, I am semi-interested in it, but it's not what I want I want to do with my life. The problem is, I don't really know what I do want to do. I just don't know that I'm not doing what I want to be doing. Honestly, I don't get enjoyment out of many activities. Part of me actually wants to drop out of college, but I only have a year left, so it's not an option. I just don't know what I want to do. I feel that even if I do get a great job...so what? I'm going to be a wage-slave my whole life and then die. We're all going to die, so what's the point. But it's sort of reassuring that we're all going to die, because it leaves us more freedom to do whatever the hell we want.   Another issue is that I've never been in a relationship, which doesn't bother me so much. I also have no desire for sex. So perhaps I'm asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships. People think that if they don't have someone they are incomplete or a loser. Why can't people just be happy alone? Why can't people be happy with themselves? I think there's more to life than relationships and love. What's with society's obsession over love. Because when it comes down to it, if you're not happy with yourself, and don't love yourself, you're not gong to be happy in a relationship. Relationships are not a cure to make yourself happy.   Between school and relationships, I'm just at a very confused point in my life. Society's typical path of good career, marriage, white picket fence, kids is not for me..   On top of everything, I have an extremely overbearing mother who won't stop telling me what jobs to apply for and what to do with my life.

I take life pretty seriously, if not, too seriously. So i'll maybe laugh like once a month. The problem with this is, i'll laugh at the stupidest times. For example, while in class overhearing an odd conversation, or during an instructional video... You know, i really try not too, but you can't hold back sometimes. I've also found that i am socially awkward? I'm really shy, and unless i'm talking technical with somebody, i find i begin to bring up the strangest subjects. In my school, more than i care to remember i have been called a "Creeper". I am assuming this mean a stalker, but i never have really stalked anybody. In fact, i tend to ignore people. Once in the cafeteria, a group of girls looked over to me and shouted " Creeper" so in reply i shout, " Don't flatter yourselves." Yeah, obviously a bit disrespectful, but all in all i think they had it coming to them. So am i weird or what?
20090202220319AAXSa1E	Health;Alternative Medicine	Can anyone recommend a pediatrician in NYC who doesn't think that the whole vaccine/autism link is bogus?	There really isn't a category specific enough for this question, so I thought I should post it here also.  Thanks.      I am tired of fighting my child's doctor. Actually, I'm pretty tired of mainstream medicine in general, but it has to be covered by my insurance,so I don't have a choice.      I don't need someone who is on the DAN list necessarily, but I need someone who isn't HOSTILE to the alternative medical community's treatments and who doesn't automatically write off the whole vaccine/autism thing as being a lie stupid people tell themselves.      This is my child I am talking about; I am asking you in advance to only answer me if you have the answer I'm seeking. I'm not interested in a debate on this topic or being upset even more today than I already am.

20090202220511AAC66my	Health;Mental Health	Does this sound like dissociative behavior/symptoms or simply depression and anxiety?	before i was admitted to a psychiatric hospital I had a difficult time staying in the present. i couldn't focus and thought i was going to lose my mind. that could be attributed to depression and anxiety, but during my first few days at the hospital i seemed to have become detached from reality, i couldn't talk to people normally, i would stutter and stammer A LOT, my speech was very, very... slow, the ideas i wanted to convey were in my mind but verbalizing them was a difficult task because i couldn't focus. after a few more days my family came to visit me but when I saw them it was like they weren't real to me...i knew intellectually that they were my parents, but there wasn't that sense of "they are my parents"...they didn't seem real or that i forgot about them entirely, i also recall having a vague sense that i was forgetting who I was, losing my sense of identiy..so what i did as soon as they left was write a list of all the positive memories associated with my family i could think of and later asked them to bring family photos in to my room. eventually i overcame the brief detachment, but does that sound like dissociative behavior or was it perhaps common to the depression i was experiencing? I ask because all of these symtpoms mentioned were linked to psychotic depression by my psychiatrist, and i believe that i was misdiagnosed. i wasn't experiencing psychotic episodes such as hallucinations or delusions (unless you count the fear of losing your identity as well as others a delusion, personally i think its linked to depression and anxiety) UNTIL months after i was discharged.. which makes me think that they are linked to the medications im taking and not some serious illness. what do you think?

Is it allowed to smoking in your hotel room? (in any Seattle, Houston, and Anchorage hotels) because my friend had the case of booking a room online and he put smoking room as preference...(I'm sure he done this because I saw his reservation form) but not allowed to smoking in the room. Or he was made this story, cuz he said he didn't book a smoking room but the hotel told him that's the only room available (is that make any sense?)   And he's a non smoker, do you think he lied to me abt he already quit but the fact is he's still smoking by looking the story above?? (also need your opinion on this)      PS: I'm an "occasionally" smoker, will go to US on April, and curious abt the law...      Thanks for ur answer :)

20090202221100AAcWtcJ	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	What is my injury? (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome?)?	I ran cross country for my high school, but I fell back in September. All I got was a cut on my right knee, which was fine, but I limped on it for about a week. Then I started limping on my left leg, no pain. My coach pulled me out of practice and about a week later I had pain in my left knee. Eventually, I went to physical therapy and was able to run again for 2 weeks, but suddenly both my knees started hurting. I went back to physical therapy, tried running again in November, but couldn't even run 100 meters. I have not tried running since and have had severe pain ever since.      My doctor(s) have ruled out miserable malalignment, torn meniscuses, fractures, etc. MRIs, x-rays, lab work, and a bone scan did not show anything. I do have turned in knees, but that does not explain why my symptoms would have started only after a fall. They would have occurred earlier, such as when I played soccer when I was younger.      My doctor thinks it might be Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. Any ideas? If it is CRPS, how is it best treated? And would I be able to run again next fall?

20090202221420AAKRsKT	Health;Mental Health	Could I potentially have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder?	I feel I have some weird tendencies and I wanted an opinion. I feel I have tendencies of OCD but I'm not sure.       New things cannot be scratched or I mentally break down until I get a new one. Even small minute scratches bother me on new things. If a new computer or phone has even a piece of dust under it I return it for a new one. New things need to be in perfect condition for me. Although those same things a few years later get treated poorly and I don't care about scratches.      Small things such as names on game accounts or having multiple account for one thing bother me.      I develop patterns sometimes on the spot and usually everyday. Such as locking the front door I'll lock it but then I'll have to do it a 2nd and 3rd time but the next day I will not and only lock it once.      If something gets into my mind, it stays. If the T.V. is off by the slightest angle I will not be able to watch it until I move it to the correct angle, sometimes causing me to get up 3 or 4 times before it's right.       Any opinions? I realize you're not all doctors but maybe some of you know something that could help me and yes I will speak to my doctor about this.

I tested positive for type 1 herpes  (6 months ago)!Now 6 months later i am now testing positive for type 2 herpes! Now i have been doing alot of studying sense i found out i have had type 2 herpes. Ok i took the std test on jan 16, 2009. I slept with john(its a made up name) on jan 1, 2009.  I have had a long term partner as well.(We will call him Jeff) I slept with him last i would say end of oct to beginning of nov of 2008. He went into jail middle nov to the end of dec 31 of 2008. We haven't had sex yet sense he has been out of jail. Now when i got my tests back on jan 23 my H levels were 4.10 for type 2 & 5.00 for type 1 herpes. Now here is the question is it possible that within a lil over 2 weeks time that my antibodies for type 2 raised that high to show on the std test? I thought it took 2-6 months for antibodies to register on a std test! Now here is the next question. Sense i had type 1 herpes already is it possible the type 1 herpes virus could of made the type 2 herpes antibodies faster so it would register on the std test sooner? So that john would of been the one that infected me is that possible? I think it was jeff that infected me. The herpes type 2 would of had more time to make the antibodies! Like say forth 3 months. And that sounds better actually. What do u think?Thanks every one for helping me out cause i really need it!

The latest surgery I had I warned my doctor about it; as I have harmed nurses and doctors before, and he said that it was no problem and that it was common for people my age to be violent. So his remedy was to strap my arms, legs, and torso to the bed. Well, it really only intensified my anxiety. I had a full on panic attack on top of the violence and trying to get out of the restraints. I had bruises and cuts from the straps the next day.       This does really concern me and I am wondering if it is normal. It can be very traumatizing because I feel so awful for what I have done. I've broken a nurse's nose, and harmed doctors and myself in these fits of rage.       Is this normal? Why do I do this? Is there something I need to suggest to my physician that is being overlooked?
20090202224202AAOdKTv	Health;Men's Health	Is it likely that medications taken as a teenager stunted my growth?	I took medications for depression and anxiety from ages 14 - 22. Is it likely to have slowed down emotional and physical development? My mother is 5'5", father nearly 6'2" and I am 5'10". My intelligence is somewhat above average in most ways and when I went off meds at 22 I noticed that I became more assertive and able to express more emotions. I did not become more anxious, as a matter of fact my anxiety waned.

For those that do not know what that is, it is basically where they cauterize some of your cervix due to precancerous cells.  Anyways Last Saturday I had rough sex meaning rougher than usual.  I had some cramping that night.  2 days later I noticed a brownish (old blood) discharge.  From then on I have had minor cramping & a constant pink tinge when I wipe everytime and DO need to wear a panty liner daily.  I am not "flowing" like when I am on my period and that is NOT due until the 10th.  Could the bleeding be because  that my cervix is bleeding due to the LEEP and rough sex?  Or could it be something else?  THANKS in advance

I wasnt a slut when all this ahppened, I was this innocent kid. I had a boyfriend during all this but cheated on him because I was looking for comfort. He was the person I love msot and understood me the most. the thing is when I get involved with guys is its never one, the guys best friend tries to hook up with me and other stuff. I jsut slept with a married guy whos in middle of a divorce. The only time I had sex beyond rape, it was horrible and now Im afraid Im pregnant. I am so overwhelmed and scared. I cant sleep cause I get nightmares. I am having a really difficult night tonight. I am in therapy twice a week, but I need a way to egt through tonight. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I'm a healthy 17 year old male and for the past few nights I haven't been able to get into a deep rest and feel like I'm half-awake, half-asleep most of the night. This weird feeling comes over me as if I'm being smothered.. Then I wake up in a weird position and try to go back to sleep but can't. I feel a sinking feeling on my entire torso and head. I've tried sleeping with more sheets- same story. I've tried sleeping with hardly any sheets- same story. I'm waking up at like 4 AM for no reason.. The other day I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't fall back to sleep so I just got up and started playing my guitar for about 15 minutes and then was able to fall aspleep fortunately.      Anyway this is a very weird and unpleasant feeling and was wondering if you knew what could potentially be causing it.. Thanks.

I went on the cabbage soup diet for a week and lost eleven pounds and then binged the entire next week gaining 5 of those lost pounds back. I noticed with the cabbage soup it was so much easier because the food was all planned out and i know weight watchers is kinda like that. you have a certain limit of points and that's all you can have. I have done weight watchers before and I still have some of the stuff like books and one of those little cardboard point counters. I am seriously thinking about doing weight watchers but I am wondering if you all think i will do alright doing it with the stuff i already have and not attending meetings and whatnot. any input would be appreciated.

Now after taking it for 10months and these last 2 or 3 months I've been moody. Then this last month I started getting depressed and thinking about hurting myself. Realistically I don't want to hurt myself, the thought just pops into my head out of no where. I've been so depressed all I've wanted to do was stay in bed all day. I've spent hours crying straight, I've made myself sick I've cried so much. I can't control it. Once it starts I can't stop it. I thought it'd stop so I've been taking my medicine as normal, but it's clear to me that I HAVE to see my doctor. Is it possible my medicine is as at fault or do I have another problem? How can I stop it without staring another pill?      I appreciate the answers.

20060622031922AAQbTTr	Health;Mental Health	Why do you let your children go to war?	Letting your son go to war (or join the forces). WHY do you do it please tell me? I believe “parents believe it to be the best way to express their love (or lack of) for him”  … how ridiculous does that sound you can’t seriously what to put them in the way of a bullet!. This expression of love is a life and death decision. What father would knowingly put his son in harms way? I’m not saying don’t fight for YOUR freedom if you have to but what about the little girl in the Middle East what about her freedom? is sending in the army the right thing? You are so much smarter then this… realise it…learn the consequences of your actions. What you buy, say and watch on TV, most importantly what you teach your children and let them believe. There is no  life (victory) in death as much as you would like to believe it.      It is too late for some but those who understand my message start now with the next generation. It will take time but I will not save you if you send your love as sons with guns.

I usually wake up early at 4:30 am to practice sprint training and running downstairs and afterschool I go to swimming at 7:00 pm for 3 hours practicing (Fast) all 4 strokes, normally ending at 6,000 metres.      But then I found out that Breast Stroke and 400 to 800 metres running is my natural talent, I mean, I always win these races in most competitions, and my other strokes are all fast, but not CRAZY fast like Breast Stroke. I have great durability and can RUN not jog 800 metres in 2 minutes and 34 seconds in my quickest personal record so far.       Furthermore, idk why, I just like training Breast stroke as it kinda makes me feel free for some reason, due to the speed. Plus it' s less tiring then the other strokes.      The only problem is, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO MY MUSCLES? Will they look as nice as to when I train EVERYTHING? Or will only training the sports that I'm naturally good at make me stronger and look better- (In Body).       I also trains martial arts allot and is planning to take on another competition, though what would be the effect of training Breast stroke and 800 metres only? Will that make me better at fighting?       And will I loose the muscles I previously gained from other sports? Or will the 2 sports that I am good at maintain em'?

When i was younger i had the fastest metabolism ever. i was always one of the skinniest out of all my friends etc. i eat on average 3000-4000 calories per day and i've never been heavier than 135 lbs. however, as i get older i am gradually putting weight on.    i think i am going to try just eating 1500 calories every day and exercise. how much weight will i lose in a month and when will i start to notice the differences?

20090203021128AAid9pk	Health;Mental Health	Does TV seriously affect our mental toughness?	What I'm about to ask may sound VERY strange, but I feel it affecting me this way and I would like to ask about this.      Most people know that TV affects and influences our thoughts and thinking, right? So, I've been wondering for a long time...if a person watches lots of horror movies and violent stuff on TV and that's the kind of thing they like to watch most of the time, does it toughen and harden them up mentally or does it hurt them?      I suppose another way to ask this question would be, if someone were to always watch good stuff on TV (e.g. non-violent, happy, friendly, etc), would that soften your mentality in your brain?      Yes, I know this sounds REALLY weird, but the reason I'm asking is because whenever I watch horrors, thrillers and adult content on TV, it may disturb me to begin with, but then I become used to it and it doesn't affect me anymore. So, I wondered if that was the brain toughening up to the violent stuff. Whereas, if I watched something friendly, non-violent, maybe even cute, I feel myself becoming softer in thinking.      This is part of a personal experiment I'm doing regarding TV and it's affects on the brain.

Mostly side effects, such as when I take the pill in the morning before I go off to school, college student, in the late evening, I would feel tired and begin to develop a migraine. My whole body would give a sign that it will soon give up if I go on with my work or studies. I need at least 16 hrs in a day to do what I do. Is this side effect normal? Please help. Share your thoughts. Do you get headaches or anything? I was on Zoloft for about 3 years and it works great but Zoloft made my days fly by too quickly, meaning the years pass by without me truly living it.

I'm not overweight, but I just wanted to get into better shape. I've lost about 10 pounds in the past month, so I've gone from 185 pounds to 174 pounds. I feel great, but now my body is kind of unproportioned. My lower abdomen is still a little large, but the area-- I don't know the technical term... the area above my stomach has become very, very thin. My whole upper body looks like an hourglass, or something. I'm afraid that if I stick with my diet, I'll just lose more weight in that area until I look like a side-show act. Is there anything that I can do to shift my weight loss to my lower abdomen? What have I been doing wrong? What can I do to fix it?   Thanks.

20060908020529AAK1DBT	Health;Women's Health	Every heard of menstrual pain like this?	I am 25 and I have had severe menstrual pain from the day I started my period (10 years ago) and it has always caused me alot of problems. I have been checked for endometrios and nothing was found, and for the most part the doctors have all just brushed it off and prescribed me mortin. I have also not persued it futher because I assumed it was normal. But I take a tremendous amount of meds during the 2 days this occurs, and recently found out how horrible that is for my kidneys, liver and other internal organs. However, I cannot go an hour without taking something or I will literally not be able to pull myself up off the floor. I get severe pain (which I wouldn't discribe as cramping), nausa, diarerea, chills, and hot flashes. It is so bad that vicotin alone won't knocked it out. Recently I've been wondering if maybe this is not normal and something abnormal might be causing this. Also, how do I get around the high dosage of pain meds? Any insight would be helpful. Thanks.

Half of me says to let her come to her own conclusions while the other half instinctively knows she will just continue to blame herself for the disintegration of our relationship b/c of this potential condition and, therefore, am almost willing to let her hate me (for bringing this to her attention) in the hopes that she will eventually agree w/ me (even if she never talks to me again) and get the help she needs.

20061128161749AAtelH1	Health;Diet & Fitness	I used to be about 10 pounds underweight, now I'd like to be healthy without getting fat.?	So it all started when I was in 8th grade and I got picked on everyday of my life. I started eat less and less as I became more depressed and that summer I went from being about 115 (healthy weight) to 101 (very unhealthy). When my doctor told me I was underweight, I decided to try to become healthy again. But I started eating three moderate, healthy meals a day. After maybe a month I had fat on my stomach, thighs, and hips. I have been skinny all my life, but now I cannot eat a full meal without bloating up like a balloon. I've struggled with depression, weight loss, and weight gain for several months now, in additional to several athletic injuries which restrict my exercise options to cycling and swimming. So, my question is: how can I get back to eating more normal amounts (more than one meal a day because that's all my body seems to be able to handle) without gaining unwanted fat?

It never hurts but can be uncomfortable when it clicks almost into place rather than out of place, and sometimes when im lying down my right leg (which it mostly occurs to) will go completly numb.
