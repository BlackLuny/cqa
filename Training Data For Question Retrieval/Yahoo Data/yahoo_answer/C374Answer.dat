MCvC6SwQaa	In many older homes, the electric system is grounded to the water supply pipes.  For you to be getting a shock, either a switch, recepticle, or plugged in device has developed a ground fault, and is energizing the ground - your cold water pipe.    You have a clue in that it does not do it if a switch is on / off downstairs.  The problem is more than likely related to this circuit.  Unplug all of the items plugged into this circuit to see if the condition fixes itself.  If it does, then one of the items plugged in has developed a problem and is faulting to ground. (loose wire inside unit, etc.)  Eliminate them by using a meter to the ground of the applicance with the plugs.  It should read zero all the time.     If unplugging did not help, start the process of pulling the recepticles, switches, light fixtures, etc.,,, and look for a loose wire or connection that is energizing to ground.  You could also have something like a metal juntion box, and the wire insulation is damaged.  Just trace it down, be paitent, and you will find it.      As far as the boiler, there should be no smell of fumes.  If it is a combustion unit, there should be an evacuation fan that comes on before the unit lights.  Check to make sure the vent stack is clear.  Someone also mentioned a possible code issue.  Check with your local authority having jurisdiction to determine the codes.  |`|AA10801582	Not disagreeing with any other answers.... But this can be an effect of static buildup, caused by clothing. Try touching the pipe/tap, then, ok you get a minor shock.

I would still have a qualified electrician look into this, it shouldn't cost more than 25 to $50, to be SAFE, Gusto I just noticed u talked about a switch downstairs MAKE sure it is grounded that's prob where the prob is.

E-MAIL ME FOR HELP  gustoguy@sbcglobal.net|`|jXZae9gIaa	Something isn't right! you need to get someone for the gas board or Corgi registered person out to check your boiler. And someone to check why you keep getting a shock ff the taps. Call your local council and tell them they'll get someone to sort it out. While your on the phone to them tell them you got kids they'll spend up the process. Usually this works!    Good luck!|`|Jh7CmSa8aa	I was called to a job on an old farm house once with this exact problem.  I must admit I didn't believe they were getting shocked from the water.  Stupid me, I turned it on an WHAM!  Yep.    That was a nicked wire under the sink where it had been fished through the metal "lathe" in the wall.  The lathe was also against the water pipe.  Because of the skin effect of the metal lathe, the current never built high enough to trip the breaker.    The point is, this is a major problem that could be anywhere.  If they just installed a new boiler, I would start there.  I would look at what penetrations were made in the wall.    This is definitely not something you should have to handle if it is a rented house.  It's a problem the landlord should handle. If the landlord refuses, contact the City inspectors office and the housing authority.    Good luck.    http://www.rickdoan.com|`|yjyBbVJoaa	it doesnt sound normal.

Room sealed boilers are permitted to be installed in a bedroom here in the UK.A CO detector should also be fitted in the room.  Phone Transco if you think something is not right.They will come out and shut the appliance down,your landlord will have to act then.  Not sure about the shock from the tap,it seems that there is some kind of earth leakage on the electrics from the boiler.  The installer or the manufacturer should come back and check it out.|`|AA10974251	Hi, you are getting a shock because something is not properly earthed, so the current is travelling throught the tap as it is using this as its earthing point.  Get the switch/electrics checked out, you really don't want to risk a bad shock.  There are organisations that can help you, or else contact the Citizens Advice Bureau, if your Landlord is not sorting these problems for you.  A combi boiler needs an external flue, but may still smell.  Maybe fit it in an insulated cupboard with a decent exterior flue.  Hope this helps, sorry to ramble on!..Tim.|`|216933f9b29f529afd48bf4239c52298aa	international plumbing code says that you cannot have a water heater in a bedroom or bathroom unless they are electric.

AA12346099	Well some spiders are able to jump pretty good distances, but I think they depend on the wind and their bodies to accomplish this feat. They can project their webs at remarkable speeds and distances based on their size. As for the wind this how many baby spiders leave the nest they climb as high as they can and then shoot a stream of web into the air, the current then picks them up and takes them sometimes just a few feet but they can wind up miles away if conditions are right. I'm sure this same principle could be used in web making also but instead of being carried off the end of the web would come in contact with some opposing structure like a tree or house and this would give the spider a kind of bridge in which to build the web.|`|AA12260209	They shoot it across then climb it.

All you need is a needle, sewing thread, and a bowl of popcorn. Thread the needle and poke through the middle of the popcorn. Keep going until you have a long string.|`|AA10730940	How to String Popcorn on a Christmas Tree    Nothing smells as good as fresh popcorn especially when you are stringing them for your Christmas tree. This project may take a little time, but it is well worth the effort. Your children will delight in helping string the popcorn, as well as eating it...so pop plenty.  Steps       1. Pop, or microwave, some popcorn. At least one large size bowl is needed, but that will depend on the size of your tree. Be sure to let the popcorn cool before you continue on to the next step.     2. Thread the needle, but do not cut the thread from the spool. It will take lots of thread in order for the popcorn garland to cover an entire tree. (See tips below for an alternate method.)     3. Make sure that the popcorn has cooled, then start stringing a piece at a time (inserting the tip of the needle in the center of each piece), while pushing it further down on the thread, and making room for more popcorn.     4. Once you feel that you have enough garland for the size of tree that you have, tie off the end of the thread by looping the thread, pulling tightly, and going under the loops a few times. Once well-secured, so that popcorn won't fall off, carefully cut the thread.     5. Hang the very special garland, created with love and patience, on your Christmas tree.     6. When Christmas is over and the tree comes down, string the popcorn garland on a tree outside for the birds to enjoy - they will especially love it if you use cranberries.       Tips        * Letting the popcorn sit out for a while to get stale will make it easier to string, because it won't be as crisp and likely to break when you stick the needle in it.      * It is best to have a needle with a large eye, for easier threading.      * Dental floss is stronger than thread and it is easier to slide the popcorn down using waxed dental floss. Quilting thread will also work well.      * Stringing the popcorn in two or three foot lengths, then tying them together, is easier than trying to string one very long strand. A very long piece of garland is harder to manage as it tends to loop back on itself and get tangled.      * Another neat idea is to add cranberries to your garland. Simply alternate between cranberries and popcorn. A ratio of five popcorns and then one cranberry looks great and won't weigh down your thread.|`|e6050b128fec2326f046e03f73d2420caa	Everyone told you how to string popcorn so I'm going to tell you what to do with it after christmas -hang it in the trees outside so the birds can eat it  :)

VLuC4JDHaa	When it is to cold for you to be outside, it is too cold for a fern. Bring it in when you don't want to be outside for any length of time.|`|AA10687007	An outdoor fern left outside over winter will go into a dormant stage and grow back in the spring. However if you want it to remain green and still be green in the spring right away take it inside and it will be like any other house plant.
AA11474133	I guess you asked this 3 times (or more, if I haven't found it yet).    See my complete answer to another one.    The other answers here mention the opposite phases, although some of the details are incorrect.  The 120 degree comment is for 3 phase only, and does not apply to your house.    The scary comment is the one that says the 2 phases in the panel are on opposite sides.  THIS IS NOT TRUE!  Do NOT connect the 2 hots of a 12/3 multiwire branch circuit to breakers that are across from each other (same row).  That would put them on the same phase.  Opposite phases are next to each other.  Double wide (2 pole) breakers are on opposite phases, and are in slots that are next to each other (vertically).|`|AA10633231	I thought I would be able to answer this question. I will check back for the answer!  haha  I think I have a sense for the answer but can't put it into technical terms.      Anjelkake  absolutely babe!!!! Unless it's a dual brealer that uses the same side, right?|`|AA10913242	it's called alternating current ;the power is rising and collapsing. the power comes from a generator with three separate stator/rotors each at 120degrees apart ; there is a time delay between each power surge. this is the 60cycle per second. you must make sure the breakers are on separate phases , do you understand? then its safe|`|AA10804655	Red and black circuit should be using two different phases. Therefore, 20A load on circuit A and 20A load on circuit B using the same return line would result in a 20A load on the return for EACH phase, not at the same time.|`|AA11136356	Just connect each circuit to a different phase.  In case you are unfamiliar, usually that would mean a breaker on each side of or in your breaker box.  You have two "legs" each of "110" coming in to your box. Look at the large wires coming in and you'll notice that they go one each to the two different sides of the breaker panel. So put red on one side, black on the other.  The neutral will just connect to the neutral bar.  Based on a 20 amp rating, each circuit should handle about 16 amps of draw.  You won't need to combine amperages on both circuits.  Although it is more expensive and a bit harder to work with, if you'd be more comfortable, you could always get 10/3 wire instead of 12/3.
AA11474133	Your best source would be recommendations.  Find people you know that have used an electrician.  The BBB is only a list of those who chose to pay to be a member.  A large yellow page ad means a big company (generally) or at least one that wants to pay for the big ad.  Of course make sure they are properly licensed (assuming you aren't in one of the areas of the country that has no licensing requirements).  Depending on what you are doing, get several estimates.  Just talking with them could give you a sense of who knows what they are doing.  Like any trade, just because they are properly licensed doesn't mean they do the best quality.  Will they get a permit for the work if one is required?  I would question a licensed contractor that skips the permit if it is required--what other shortcuts would they take?    What is it you want done?  What city are you in?    About service magic.  The following is from their web site:  Q: What qualifications must a contractor have to join ServiceMagic?  A: All contractors and service professionals must be licensed according to the laws in their state and must carry general liability insurance. ServiceMagic also checks all members for lawsuits, liens, judgments and bankruptcies in the last three years.    This does not tell you anything about the quality of their work.|`|AA10287427	Contact your local BBB. Electricians (as well as plumbers) in most (if not all) states have to be licensed and bonded. The reputable ones generally will have the bigger,better adds in the Yellow pages and may show that they are members of the BBB.|`|920806577478d81c995ca29296e2f4c0aa	Another great source for finding electricians is Service Magic. They prescreen each contractor that uses their service. In addition to checking their licensing, insurance and bondability, they do a background check; looking for felonies, judgements etc. This is a great service that we use and they refer us a lot of work. Their website is http://www.servicemagic.com
AA11474133	Torque might not be on the nameplate, but every motor has a torque spec.  If the load requires more torque than the motor is capable of delivering, it will stall.  A motor has a torque-speed curve, so hard to give a single number for a nameplate.    A prior answer saying torque and power aren't related is wrong.  The power a motor is delivering at an instant is the torque multiplied by the speed.  The peak power is at a medium speed (between stalled and full no-load speed), but I'm not sure if the nameplate power is that peak or something else.  Marketing of many consumer devices uses an inflated power a motor could never deliver continuously (see http://users.goldengate.net/~kbrady/moto...|`|AA11276475	Torque is how much power the motor has at fire up...what kind of resistance it can stand and still start turning. HP is a measure of its power at a specific revolution...The two are not related...a high hp motor might have very poor torque when firing up. High torque motors are usually 3 phase to get that added punch.|`|a8e1f8eccff217346ca32f132c02836daa	Horsepower is a measurement used to rate power of an engine.

c3ad288725e89e6df16d12e392e5789baa	Your dad is right. Wait 'till you get your own place to redo the walls and  carpet. For now, get some cheap throw rugs to cover the carpet and  posters or other material to pin to the walls. You can be creative without  having a lot of money.|`|1a6ca6cc52f7388039d97f236a791c80aa	If you're looking for an exotic type of theme for your room, the best place to go is Cost Plus World Market if you don't have a lot of money.   The green and beige thing is fine if you go with a palm tree/bamboo type of decor.    I also would look at Target!  They've got a lot of things that have an exotic flair to them.    Some do it yourself projects you could partake in are gel candle making (you can color the gel and put objjects such as shells in them - get the glassware at the dollar store), use photographs from vacations and decorate dollar store frames with paint, shells, etc., and look on ebay for anything that's funky.  You can get a lot of cool stuff on Ebay for a song!    And, I hate to tell you this but a "gothic looking canopy" from Hot Topic isn't going to match bamboo looking stuff!    Go to the fabric store instead and find some sheers that match your bedding and get a ring and make one yourself!!!  You can probably find the ring on Ebay!    Another great idea if you're going with the exotic look is to find some tribal masks (Cost Plus, Ebay and African art fairs) and put them up!      I have two themed rooms in my house.  One is Jimmy Buffet/Margaritaville looking and the other is African.  Most of the stuff I got was from a variety of places but art fairs, Ebay, Cost Plus, Target and garage sales are the best!    Good Luck!

AA11347425	Strelitzia is a genus of five species of perennial plants, native to South Africa. The genus is named after the duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, birthplace of Queen Charlotte of the United Kingdom. The common name of the genus is bird of paradise flower, because of a supposed resemblance of its flowers to the bird of paradise.    The species S. nicolai is the largest in the genus, reaching 10 m tall; the other species typically reach 2-6 m tall. The leaves are large, 30-200 cm long and 10-80 cm broad, similar to a banana leaf in appearance but with a longer petiole, and arranged strictly in two ranks to form a fan-like crown of evergreen foliage. The flowers are produced in a horizontal inflorescence emerging from a stout spathe. They are pollinated by sunbirds, which use the spathe as a perch when visiting the flowers; the weight of the bird on the spathe opens it to release the pollen onto the bird's feet, which is then deposited on the next flower it visits. Dogs like to eat these plants, but the seeds, if eaten, are toxic, and can cause abdominal pain and vomiting.|`|AA10455980	yup|`|c3ad288725e89e6df16d12e392e5789baa	They're blooming right now - very pretty. Good choice. Give it full sun.
AA11474133	I assume you mean a switch and receptacle on a single strap, and you want the switch to control the light.  If there is power coming into the switch box and then to the light, this will work.    The brand of devices I use ships with the switch set up to control the receptacle, with a break off tab between the screws.  There should be 4 screws (plus the green ground) on the strap, 2 for the switch and 2 for the outlet.  Break the tab if there is a connection between the switch and the outlet, and go from there.    If this isn't enough information for you, then get an electrician, since you shouldn't be doing electrical work without knowledge.|`|c93ea3c8cf1c3dd9a0e3b461289096d9aa	Since we can't see the switch you are using, it is hard to describe exactly what you need to do.  Basically, you will be wiring the two in series. The hot wire would run to the outlet first, then through the switch to the light.  The neutral from the light would attach to the switch, and the house neutral to the outlet.  If it is a one-piece combo switch/outlet, I would think the connections would be internal between the outlet and switch components, but, again, I can't guarantee the accuracy of any of this, not seeing your set-up.  Probably best to buy the book (or check it out of the library, they usually have a "how-to" section these days).|`|da873fbf3acb9de23a90c4a706135376aa	I would really recommend you go to Home Depot, Hastings, B. Dalton Book Store, Walmart or even the library and pick up a book on basic wiring. I have a Black & Decker book of Basic Wiring from Walmart and use the hell out of it for my many "honey do's". It is invaluable to me.|`|d00f07fee843d6f28d0e6390574cc993aa	you may want to go to homedepot and spend about 15 dollars on a book, which will be very helpful in future house projectsand even answer this one.|`|AA11373201	do not trust those books. I am a Master electrician with 12 year in the trade. Those books are a joke. We have a few at our shop just to laugh at how many mistakes there are in those books. Twice my boss has written to the publisher of those books when the mistakes are bad enough to be a hazard. You should just hire an electrician. You can probably find a older retired electrician who will work cheap.

Then they may dance about and utter profanities.|`|AA11474133	If it is labeled line and load or the instructions indicate it, then do not switch them.  If there is no mention, the two terminals/wires on the thermostat are the same, then it doesn't matter.

1518400d679185b02f0a404d7a26c784aa	I didn't think it mattered with just a two wire themostat it's just a switch that's either on or off telling the furnace to be on or off.    Well, when all else fails, match the one color that you have:  red to red and then hook the black and white together.    The most it will do is not work and you can switch them.|`|b1ac19592a228bc2f5687f35c427873daa	Do you only have two wires going to your thermostat from your furnace, or are there more wires,, if so what colors?|`|AA11474133	Line is power in and load is power out, as another answer said.  A line voltage (120V, 240V) thermostat would have power in and out, which sounds like what you have.  But if the old thermostat just had 2 wires, it might be a low voltage thermostat.  How big are the white and red wires?  You might have the wrong thermostat.  If you don't know what you are doing, you should get a professional to help you.  Even a low voltage thermostat if connected wrong could damage your furnace.  There isn't enough information in your question to really help you get the right thermostat.|`|fb2bc5066e973c116ece4c08fc55a9d2aa	line wire is the wire coming from the transformer feeding the tstat from the furnace....the load is the line going back to the control telling the furnace to initiate the start up sequence, if you have a 2 wire system either wire is ok, since what your doingis simply breaking the feed wire by the tstat going back to the furnance, ike a light switch in your house|`|6711a1d84892dbba34b6771f8ea24977aa	electrically speaking, LINE is power IN, LOAD is power OUT.    But, thermostatically speaking, if you only have two wires it doesn't matter which wire goes where. most old heat only system thermostats work off of 'line voltage' , actually millivoltage generated by the thermocouple. the thermocouple tells the gas control valve to turn the gas on or off.

AA11474133	Yes, this is allowed.  14AWG is fine on a 15A circuit.  The 14/2 will connect to just half of the split receptacle.  This is fine weather the split receptacle is for a multiwire branch circuit or half the duplex receptacle is switched.  The underground part needs to have a wiring method that is allowed underground.  NM (Romex) is not allowed underground or any wet (outside) location.  UF is the direct burial wire to use.|`|AA11372747	Just come out the other side of the 14/3 receptacle with the 14/2|`|fb2bc5066e973c116ece4c08fc55a9d2aa	code violation... dont do it|`|e85c50d491e2085232a5b2228c50f719aa	If you must, you should 12 wire, not 14.  14 is for lighting, not wall plugs, the wires not big enough to carry a higher load.|`|AA10301396	The electrical engineer is right, it's better to run the UF 14/2 inside conduit for underground though and although I don't think you are going to use that wire outside (it is harder to clean and strip).

1197885b48a186ff01889966e63d4b00aa	There are many reasons for mulching and depending on why you are mulching can make a difference in the time of year that you would want to mulch:  1.  Weed suppression - mulch all times of year to keep weeds from crowding out the plants you want to grow. At least 3" after it has settled.  2.  Conserving Moisture - any time of year.  Use less and bigger pieces of (big bark or even rocks) mulch around plants that prefer dry soil and smaller pieces and thicker (chopped leaves, sawdust, etc.) around plants that like moisture.    3.  Moderating soil temperature.  For plants that like cooler temperatures, mulch all times of year to help keep the soil cooler.  For plants that love warmth (tomatoes, corn, peppers, etc) don't mulch until the soil has heated up - in late spring or early summer.  4..Improvement of soil structure - mulch all times of year.  Mulch helps the soil to live and increases the nutrients available to the plants.  Some pests, however, overwinter in the mulch.  So if a plant has a specific pest that reoccurs every year it is a good idea to replace that mulch in the very early spring.  Compost the old mulch to get rid of the pests.  5.  Reduction of erosion - all times of year.  6.  Responsibly get rid of the leaves and grass that you collect.  Use them as mulch whenever you have any if you don't compost them.|`|7c31b7d2776f111b87031de337da7dfcaa	When the weather is nice where u live. then ur not freezing when your putting it down. and the snow would cover it up if u put it on now. so its a good idea to wait until spring/summer time.|`|AA10804655	Generally in the late spring.

Mulching gives the plant a consistent supply of water.  In the late spring, the ground is saturated with water, unless you've had very dry weather.  Don't overdo it with the mulch, though.  About an inch or two is enough. If you put too much mulch down, it becomes an attractive home for ants and insects.

I would highly recommend throwing it away because the gasoline will eat away at the fabric causing that section to wear out much faster than the rest of it.

eacOjLQeaa	No, but crushing them will release the oils faster and maake it stronger|`|AA11669764	You dont have to crush the plant to get a scent, you can just rough it up a little, brush your hands over the plant and it will deposit the oils on your skin.  You can also snip short pieces and put them in a bag to freshen your drawers or closet.      Crushing the leaves will release the oils and give you a much stronger aroma.|`|b3baee7b0a2713d86bae78181f187850aa	You get to smell something only if it is a gas that is soluble in the lining of your nose. Which is why ammonia is so strong smelling. And perfumes all come in liquid form, never as a powder. They are known as volatile liquids that can turn easily into a gas, dissolve in your nose linings and then you get the smell.     So, you can smell lavender if you wave it under your nose but only faintly. Its fragrant oils float out of its pores (called stomata) into the air and into your nose. But crush the flower and you expose the oils inside to the air. No need to waft out of pores now, but the essential oils can burst out from the cuts into the air around your nose.    Aaaaah! Heavenly. Lavender is one of my favourite scents.    It's the same reason for smelling perfume very faintly when you hold a bottle of the perfume, but when you pull out the stopper, you really get it strong.

Tu peux essayer avec du citron, mais attention, je ne sais pas comment va ragir le marbre avec du citron !|`|5a753a521dfdaac39b3e661f4f5b67a5aa	SOLS EN MARBRE    Le marbre est une pierre poreuse. Il a donc tendance  se rayer et  absorber les taches. Pour cette raison, il est recommand de le protger avec un produit du type Texguard ou encore de le cirer mais trs lgrement. On peut galement passer dessus un chiffon doux imprgn de glycrine ou d'huile de lin, puis on le fait briller avec un chiffon de flanelle.     On nettoie le marbre  laide dune brosse souple imbibe deau additionne de savon noir ou de lessive st Marc.         SOL EN MARBRE BLANC   On nettoie les sols en marbre avec de l'eau citronne additionne de sel.        On comble les fissures du marbre avec de la bougie chaude. Laissez scher. Oter dlicatement l'excdent  l'aide d'une spatule. Cirez le marbre.           SOL EN MARBRE CLAIR   On nettoie le marbre clair avec de l'eau savonneuse additionne de quelques gouttes de Javel.       SOL EN MARBRE DE COULEUR   On nettoie le marbre de couleur avec du blanc d'Espagne additionn de quelques gouttes de benzine.     Rayures sur le marbre   On ponce les rayures et les dfauts  l'aide de papier abrasif trs fin.     Rcuprer l'clat du marbre   Il faut appliquer, avec des mouvements concentriques, un produit de polissage. Rincez, schez puis protgez le marbre avec une crme ou un produit lustrant.  On peut galement lui redonner son brillant en le polissant avec un chiffon imprgn de ptrole.    Dtacher le marbre     Taches de rouille sur le marbre   On les fait dispara?tre avec de l'eau oxygne  20 volumes.     Taches de br?lure de cigarette sur le marbre   On les limine en passant dessus la moiti d'un citron.     Taches d'encre sur le marbre   Elles dispara?tront si l'on passe dessus un chiffon imbib d'un mlange d'1/3 d'ammoniaque et de 2/3 d'eau oxygne  20 volumes.     Taches de graisse  On fait dispara?tre les taches graisseuses en appliquant dessus une pate compose de blanc dEspagne et de bicarbonate de soude. On laisse reposer quelques heures, puis on rince, on sche, on cire et enfin on polit.    Taches de peinture  On limine ces taches en tamponnant un chiffon imbib dabord deau savonneuse puis ensuite de trbenthine. Si la tache est ancienne on ajoute  la trbenthine un peu de pierre ponce en poudre.       Sur le marbre, n'importe quelle tache dispara?t si on tend sur les zones taches une pate lgre compose de 1/3 de bicarbonate de soude et de 2/3 de poudre de pierre ponce. Laisser scher puis rincer  l'eau et au savon noir.  En dernier recours, mais en dernier recours seulement, on peut toujours utiliser de la soude caustique. Rincer. Scher.  Une fois le marbre nettoy il vaut mieux le protger en l'encaustiquant ou en passant dessus un chiffon doux imprgn de glycrine ou d'huile de lin. Faire briller avec un chiffon de flanelle.     Si vous utilisez la soude caustique pensez  enfiler des gants de caoutchouc|`|84419309230db6ea3f0e73a0efd39ac0aa	Mlangez du trichlorthylne avec de la farine ou du talc .

AA11474133	Who was the moron that used CAT 5 wire for a thermostat?  That is probably 24 gauge wire which is too small.  Thermostat wire is typically 18 (though 20 is also used).    You could measure voltage between the wires.  I would expect 24V between one of the wires (which would go to the R terminals) and each of the other 3.  To find the other 3 would be trial and error.  The thermostat connects the G to R when the fan is on, connects Y (and G) to R for A/C (Y to R turns on the compressor).  It connects W to R for heat.    I don't understand what you say "both of them are in either Rc or Rh".  If you are connecting 2 wires to the R's that won't work.    Could maybe help if you said exactly how you wired it and what happens.
psnaJcvpaa	I think the whole idea of  the 'act' of washing clothes the conventional way (washing machine or hand wash is to make the clothes clean and smelling fresh.    In my opinion this is not a good way to 'wash' clothes.

S9vj6vuhaa	Single solar cells or small panels are not compatible with your household current and attempting to plug ANYTHING not designed for electrical outlet use is DANGEROUS and could be Deadly.The3 low amount of current generated by single cell or small panels would be negligible in any case.It takes dozens and dozens of cells or a large panel plus the connecting interface to have any real effect, Sorry.   As to a generator,you need to meet certain requirements,particularly an approved transfer switch to hook into your home wiring.I suspect the cost of the generator and fuel to run it would cost more than the energy saved.Generators also requires routine service and maintenance which also costs money.|`|AA11474133	A backup generator needs a transfer switch that switches between utility power and the generator.  A solar cell or other thing to provide power at the same time as utility power is a lot more complicated and would need the utility involved, unless you treat the solar cell a generator and use a transfer switch.  Of course if you just plug directly into the generator or equivalent then no transfer switch or special wiring is involved.  Hooking up any of these to the house wiring directly has complicated rules and you probably should get an electrician.|`|Bw5Uj3rTaa	They get hook to a generator that will distribute electric or return electric to the utility company if you have a surplus of electric.  You can also do this with wind mills.  You can reference this material at the site below|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Absolutely not! - Don't even think about mixing home made and   Utility power together on the same wiring..  To plug into utility power you need to carefully match frequency and voltage.  You can't do this without a complicated set up.  On a small scale, you can charge some batteries with your solar cells, and draw separate power circuits off an inverter.|`|OrG2fBbKaa	Miniature solar cells do not produce enough AC voltage to work your home. They are primarily low voltage and amperage that can be used to charge batteries for use in the dark.  Using a standby generator you are required to have a transfer switch to energize the home.  A portable generator, can be used without it, just use extension cords to each appliance and DO NOT try to power the house wiring with it.

AA10766729	Look around your plants.  If you see little black pellets, you probably have worms of some sort.  Or just flip the leaves that have holes in them over...you'll probably find your problem.    Most Looper Moths lay their eggs on plant leaves, the eggs hatch and the Looper Worms eat the plants during the first larval stage.  You would commonly refer to them as "inch worms" although they're not technically such.      The easiest way (non-chemical) to get rid of these pests is to cut them in half with a pair of scissors.  It will take several days to do this as the eggs hatch in waves.  But once you kill all the worms, your problems should be over....for now.|`|uwpu0ZbIaa	BUGS!!! try some vegitation bug spray, not regular kinds cuz they will destroy ur plants.

The generator, or alternate source, has it's own that comes into the transfer switch.     |`|AA11474133	There are transfer switches that switch the neutral and others that don't, and how the grounds are hooked up depend on which you have.

AA11474133	Assuming you are in the US and have a 3-prong outlet already.  You do not need to run a 4th wire (ground wire) as that is only required for new homes (since 1996).  You need a 3-wire cord for your stove.  Someone provided you with the wrong plug.  Put a 3-wire cord on the stove, following the instructions which should tell you to connect the frame of the stove to the neutral (white) wire.  It is dangerous if not connected properly, so get an electrician if you have any doubt.|`|OrG2fBbKaa	Can you take a picture of your power panel and the inside of it?  That will help.  Before then I suggest you install a new cable to the power panel and have them hooked up properly.  From your description, I guess you have need of a an electrical rewire for your home.  Many homes that were adequate 15 years ago are now obsolete for the consumption of the electrical appliances. Do not ignore the needed ground wire and you do need the neutral and the 2 line leads.  Ask at the appliance store if they have a conversion kit for the range. The new ranges all require a separate ground and neutral wire to the power panel.  The older units were not required to have them separate.  |`|AA11193401	just buy a 3wire cord & outlet box|`|dlaqQE6Xaa	A picture of the "connection panel" would have been better.

TMB4d3FAaa	Yes, you can grow trees from the grapefruit seeds.  Being they were really sweet, they were nice and ripe. Unfortunately,some citrus fruits are hybrid.  A lot of the really good tasting ones are grafted onto the less tasty root stock.  With the hybrid seed, you don't really know what the final fruit will taste like.  Prepare some of those peat pellets and plant the seeds. One seed per pellet.  put them in a container or baggie so you can keep it moist while it is germinating. In a couple of weeks they should be sprouted. No more than 4 weeks.  The time will depend on temperature etc of the environment they are in. As soon as the cotyledons show, these are the first two leaves, remove the plastic bag or open the top of the container.  If it is too moist your plants may dampen off.  They like a slightly sweet soil.  A ph above neutral.  Mix in some crushed egg shells or  a little lime to the potting soil.   Place the seedling, it now has four leaves, into the pot of potting soil.  Leave it in its peat pellet undisturbed.  It's roots will grow through the pellet.  They are a tropical plant and love the warm bright lights. Place them in a bright window.  If you are in an area that is warm enough for them plant them outside.  They need plenty of water.  The can grow to 30 feet high. If there is a beekeeper near, you'll have a greatly increased crop.  Good luck.|`|Z76lgdrDaa	Based on experience with my preschooler planting a grapefruit seed in our backyard many years ago, I'd say it's very easy. He just saved a few seeds from a grapefruit he was eating, poked his finger in the dirt near the fence, dropped the seeds in, and covered it up with the dirt again. He watered it inconsistently, probably just a few times that first week. So all it took was that, and probably some normal rain and sun (half the day gets sunny in that area of the backyard)- then we suddenly had to avoid running the lawnmower over this stalk that started growing.     I want to caution you about this though- please make sure you plant it far enough away from a fence! We didn't really pay that much attention to where our cute little munchkin was planting his "tree" at the time, yet now have a very large grapefruit tree with yearly fruit WAY too close to our fence! So- make sure you get at least 2 to 4 feet away from the fence when you drop the seeds and have fun with it.|`|6rSBVcQ4aa	Yes, I've done it and have 4 Pink Grapefruit trees.  The best way is to leave the Grapefruit hole and let it sit somewhere warm until it starts to shrivel up. You can plant the seeds in any good potting soil but I have found Miracle Grow is the best. Grapefruits get very sharp thorns on them so be careful. I take pruning scissors and trim them off. They also get up to 20 or so feet depending on the variety.|`|JP2h62qiaa	Im not trying to be dull here,     1) dig hole in ground  2) place seed in hole  3)cover seed with dirt  4)water seed every other morning.

They may also ask for your landlord's details in case there are unpaid bills from the previous tenant. It's a bit more complicated though if the flat has pre-pay meters rather than it being billed.

FXnHE7mmaa	Make a baking soda paste and let sit on the stains to see if it will draw it out..formica can permanently stain, so not everything will be able to be drawn out.  http://www.naturalhandyman.com/iip/infco...|`|AA12092525	Formica counters and cabinets can be cleaned with mild liquid scouring cleaner, a light duty cleaner, baking soda, or a glass cleaner. Wipe them with a damp sponge, rinse and wipe dry. For stubborn spots, try a shot of laundry pre-wash spray or a paste of baking soda and water. Let it sit for half an hour, then rub with a nonmetallic scrubber. For a greasy stain, you can use a little rubbing alcohol for your kitchen cabinet cleaning.. If the Formica has yellowed, it is likely the discoloration is caused by prolonged exposure to the sun. A bleach based kitchen cleaning product used with a soft nylon scrubbing pad or a soft toothbrush might turn your cabinets back to white. If that doesn't work, you can try sponging on a bleach and water solution, but don't leave it on there too long, just a minute or so, then rinse well with clean water. (Make sure to wear rubber gloves and old clothing when working with bleach and be sure to protect surrounding surfaces from bleach drips...

To sense the flame is there the control module conducts a very very slight current through the flame to the sensing rod. Yes, fire will conduct electricity.     It is the sensing rod that generally needs to be polished up when it is not sensing. It will be mounted opposite the ignitor or in the center of the burner assembly. Often below the burners with the prong pointing up in to the flame.       It has a single wire on it.     Sometimes the control module is bad when not sensing though but most often a cleaning takes care of that problem.|`|AseJ6Y13aa	It is a sensor.

If you are going to start them outdoors, just put them in some good garden soil with compost mixed in.

e1de6abafc696ae0b4e49e323b85095caa	This is a throwback to the early fluorescent lamps of 40 years ago, when every time they were switched on a particle off the cathode was lost which shortened the lamp life, since the lamps were expensive to replace in those days it was considered cheaper to leave them on, as energy was cheap. We have come a long way since then with electronic starters, and shielded cathodes and lamp life in excess of 20000 hours, along with lower energy use for greater light output. So the answer is - turn off all or any lights when not in use.|`|SsB7aRExaa	All types of bulbs require more power to get started.  How MUCH power differs depending on the type of bulb.  Generally, for incandescent lights, starting uses about the same amount of power as running them for 5 minutes.  For florescents, it's about 20 minutes.  So, if you are leaving the room for less time than that, leave the light on.|`|BRnYseFKaa	i doubt thats true...it probably uses a bit of power to flick on and then off.....but leaving the light on would waste heaps more.  turning the lights on and off causes the lightbulb to burst quicker|`|jOM4bBMPaa	The Mythbusters tried out this myth a while ago, and for regular light bulbs I think you only need to have the bulb off for 3 seconds to offset the amount of energy that is used up to turn the bulb back on.

They require servicing (cleaning) in order to function well. Here's how it's done;    1. Turn the power off to the boiler.  2. Brush and vacuum any debris from the air intake.  3. Loosen the transformer or plate above the fan, leaving it attached, move it aside to reach the blower fan.  4. Use a brush and vacuum to clean the blowers blades. Use a slightly damp cloth to remove any stubborn dirt still attached.  5. Check for the Oil Port ( usually located on top or in cups on each end).  Mind you, some units are self lubricating and will not have an oil port.  6. Check your manual for the best lubricating oil for your unit.  7. Clean the outside of the unit PRIOR to opening any oil port.  8. Remove the cap/port and add a few drops of the oil.  9. Tighten transformer/replace, and cap, and turn unit back on.

There exists the possibility that altering the speed could pull in excessive carbon monoxide (the silent killer). Have a service technician find out why your unit is not working as it should, then let Him make the 'proper' repair, before you wind up in the hospital or worse still in the morgue.|`|ww12lItvaa	Yes, you need to be careful about changing the blower speed in heat.  It changes the heat rise, the temperature the furnace runs at.     Changing it to low can overheat the furnace, cause it to cycle on the overtemp safety, and increase the risk of cracking the heat exchanger.     And if you increase the speed the temperature of the air coming out the vents will be cooler. It produces the same amount of heat but blows colder although you get better circulation.     But even increasing the speed can cause problems like running too cool, cause the fan switch to cycle on and off because it cools too much,  and causing condensation in the flue rusting it out or rusting out the furnace internally.     In heat it is generally something that should only be done by a technician who will check temperatures and know where to look to check the operating temperature and heat rise range of the furnace.     Your furnace and the blower speed is sized and set to match the ducting in the house.

Hey found this and think it might be of interest to you.  check out this link and see what you think.  Sounds pretty good. http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...      Best of luck :)|`|10456fcb36c09d510c3f73faba95f075aa	Have you tried safeway or coles? It's probably something you'd find in the aisle with insect spray and mouse traps. I've seen Borax there, so you would assume they'd have boric acid too. Other than that, call pest controllers. They would be able to tell you where you can get it. Good luck, cockroaches suck! (Hey that rhymes!)|`|YfTk9f56aa	Mix your borax with something that does attract the roaches.  I always mix it with Sugar to attract ants when we have a swarm appear in the house.  They fill their boots with it and take it back to the nest, I presume the roaches will do the same.|`|yu9PHV4Maa	I'd have to question what websites are you looking at... for effectiveness yes it kills roaches but think about it..you are placing a loose unsightly powder along the base board or at the bottom of the shelving so that (in hopes that) the roaches crawl through it, more effective product are the gel baits where you can place the product out of sight where the roaches actually live.  If your concern of the toxicity of other insecticides, boric acid powder will be many times more toxic than any other insecticide you would put out or have placed out professionally.
vvJBtxXHaa	"...ants... like 'birds, NEVER EVER do anything excep t for a very importANT reason" - William Wordswordth    1.  what type of strusture do you live in...single family residence, or multi-family, apartment, condo, duplex, etc., etc, you get the idea    2.  where is your room located within that structure, upper floor, lower, central, by exterior wall on ground, 2nd floor, basement??? interior room with windows, without windows????  3.  how old is your residence?  4.  is the residence near any other type of business? or is it in the middle of B.F. EGYPT?  5. ants will come inside for various reason, depending on what type of ants they are....exactly how big are the ants, what color and description can you possibly attribute to their appearance?  (are they skinny, rat-pack, grundge looking ant types?)  .....futuristic ant gangs are the pits...and can cause health problems  6. now the issue of some type of food source is always the quest of ants  7..some prefer trails to a known water source  8..are the ant trails isolated in your bed?? or are you in the middle of some long line of ant migration?  9. if they have located some source of nutrition in your bed, you are doomed (since you have no idea what that is)  10.. look inside your box srping for "sugar daddies" or " little debbies"  those might be easy to pin-point obvious reconcilitations that you should be aware of  11. maybe your walls are their food source, so you need to spray them with RAID  12. Diazinon is the best chemical to prevent ants for several months, but any type of "crawling bug repellant for the home" will do nicely....get a jug of home insect killer that comes with a spray nozzel, and go to work  13. also ant bait traps are good to place beside trash cans, under sinks near drain pipes and in closets  14. when you begin, work from the known point of their interst back acroos the carpet, up the wall, around the room, alll the wall inside everybaseboard of the house, around every window, door and crevice  ...under every sink, kitchen and bath, anywhere ther is a water pipe, drain pipe, or other pipe -type surface  ...then outside, also around every door, window and possible crevice  ...then wait 4 to 6 hours and go back and start looking again  ..if they are persistent they will begin assembling near a door or window....  ....possibly you live in an apartment upstairs from some really nasty tenants who also have had ants??????  (if that is true, then the city health department should be brought in to "fix" the matter|`|wX5xoAN8aa	First, get some ant/bug spray, and some ant/bug powder, they are both at Walmart, Lowes, or Home Depot. Then see if you can find the nest. If you do, kill the queen ant. This will cut off production, meaning you can kill the rest of them. Spray as many as you see with the ant spray, and sprinkle the powder outside right along side your ENTIRE house.    Hope this helps, good luck.|`|FfU99xHaaa	Okay as someone who has a serious phobia when it comes to ants this story is very disturbing.    I taking a wild guess here but you might have had some other type of bug that is attracting the ants....it is said that fire ants like bed bugs.  So my advise would be try steaming your mattress with extreme heat then after that put out some ant bait and for extra measure use some kind of ant killing spray.  Then wait and hope.|`|2hUVc7Lxaa	Ants don't like crossing washing up detergent. If you find where they are coming in, like a crack in the floor put a line of detergent straight from the squeeze bottle.    Be careful of spray on your matress as they can cause respiratory problems and skin irritation. Try a barrier spray on the floor.    If there is a nest in the bed, if you can afford it buy a new matress.|`|aa2131f0b0d93de418b8d02cace49bafaa	She asked for an answer, not 20 more questions.     I would call an exterminator.
haCssg2Laa	get your decorations from somewhere that does oscar parties,  they do they carpets  the lights  everything    like this one  http://www.partyrama.co.uk/mcp/Hollywood...|`|4KtPFzz5aa	A site similar to Raven's:  http://hollywoodmegastore.com/|`|ObNA2sWNaa	You could pull up in a limo and then roll the carpet you know.|`|pDvLRewmaa	I did this for my daughter last year... it was insane but so worth it!  We started by searching Highschool musical parties where we found invites in the shape of tickets.  We included a note that showed our "events" timing... red carpet arrival, etc. and asked everyone to dress as a character, Hannah Montana, Raven, Camp Rock.    We hit the dollar store and bought plastic wine glasses that I filled with jelly beans and made a huge centerpiece out of.  They also had popcorn containers like the theatre ones... too cute.    A cardboard cutout of you and some tinfoil makes an oscar you can hang on your wall.  Tinsel to add sparkle, christmas lights for a more dramatic effect, etc.    If you find a party store they will often find the decorations you want.  My daughter had 14 girls come, it was huge they all spent the night but everyone had a blast!    Have a great party

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	They're no harm to humans or animals,  (besides the smell)  but they can be detrimental to agriculture in large groups because they suck the sap from plants.  On the other hand,  some of them,  like the Anchor Bug,  (has a red anchor shape on its back)  are considered beneficial since they feed on other insects.  Check out this site:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stink_bug  It has links you can go to also.|`|Oq5a5hRhaa	Sometimes stink bugs don't stink when you crush them (but sometimes they do). It depends on whether or not they see you coming and if you crush their scent glands.    There's not really any harm in having them in your house, but as some are not native, they may become an agricultural pest.     I would suggest, when killing them, taking a piece of toilet paper, wrapping up the stink bug in it, and then flushing down the toilet--without crushing the bug. One day, you're going to smell something.    To keep them out, you're just going to have to go around and make sure any cracks are sealed. You can't really kill them with pesticides, as the dead stink bugs will invite carpet beetles into your house (which will be a problem).|`|944iJNAdaa	I wonder if you really have stink bugs, because they really do stink when you crush them, and I don't think you could do this so fast that they wouldn't smell.  In any event, bugs are part of the natural world, and most of them are only annoying by their presence, and not outright dangerous or even inherently bad.  Tight fitting window screens, doors, and sealing up cracks and openings are the best ways to keep any insects out of your house.|`|cYhnz7GHaa	Vacuum them up, so they don't come back. If you squish them and there is an oder, that is where other stinkbugs will come.
sAuB8vLCaa	Heat in the winter is 68 day and night 63  in the summer day 78 and night 76 in.N.J. The winter gets very cold and summer hot and most days are humid.  We have to have heat in winter cause it's just to cold and our pipes would freeze.|`|x9FjUZs9aa	Always around the same temperature  give or take a couple-a-few degrees, 70oF year round.  Regardless of the season, I want to be able to use the same bedding and wear the same clothes once I get through the door. I like to sit around in a comfortable pair of shorts (not underwear), a t-shirt and indoor/outdoor slippers (if there is such a thing) or a pair of socks. And I use the same blanket/comforter summer or winter. I just may change the sheets from 100% cotton to cotton flannel in the winter.     .........................................|`|FxWppY7Baa	I keep the house 62F during the day and 55F at night (unless it is going below zero than I have to keep the thermostat at 63F or the pipes want to freeze)    Summer 75 to 80 (depending on how hot it is outside. I installed new energy efficient windows last summer and those have made a huge difference in how hot the house gets in summer. Before the windows if it was 90 outside it was 80/85 inside. Now if it is 90 outside the house is 65 to 70 inside with no AC and windows and curtains closed.|`|dl1yuCoFaa	In winter, the thermostat is set at around 60-65 degrees during the day. At night, I drop it to about 55. The kids toss their bed covers and get cold at night otherwise.     In summer, the thermostat is set at around 70-75 degrees, sometimes as high as 80. I much prefer the summer, as I can often go open windows and doors, instead of running the AC.|`|XuoT57Idaa	68-69 in the winter while we are home in the evening. 65 at night and during the day. Boy 55-60 sounds cold. You must live alone? My kids would never go for that temp, lol. But I'd like my heat bill better!    Summer time air is set for 70- 72. I hate being hot!|`|PPh1NB8Daa	In the winter I only use my gas fireplace. I like to keep it between 70 - 74 when I am here. When I leave I just turn it off. I would say it might get down to 60 or so. In the summer I have the air on about 72. Anything below 68 or so is to cold. I do not know how you can stand so cold. In the summer I just open the windows and have the house around 75 or so.|`|LU6vfqRzaa	We have a digital thermostat and in the     Winter time while we are not home (work), it is set at 60 degrees.  When we are home, 65 degrees.    Summer, not at home 75 (work) and when we are home 70.    Night time in the winter= 60 degrees  "            " in the summer= 60    That's just us though.  We are from the North but now live in the South.      :-)|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Yes we have been having some crazy weather here in Atl.  I keep my home during the winter nite-62,63 & day-65-67.  The heat dries me out too much so now I really can't being indoors with the heat going full blast. During summer& mostly cuz my system is now 30yr old I keep the temp about 80, 81.  I would do a lil lower if I could but too expensive for air to run all the time.

And keep in mind that if you want to save and scrimp and cut corners, you should do it elsewhere than on your mattress and your shoes... cause if you aren't in one, you're in the other.    Your back is worth spending money on to get a good mattress...|`|lLm5uIuDaa	If you can't afford a mattress for the size bed you are buying you need to step down to the smallest bed you can afford.  You cannot buy a smaller mattress than the bed size you are purchasing.

I just bought a memory foam king on Overstock.com for less than $500.  You will need to buy 2 twin box springs to support it.  The next size down from king is queen and it's way too small to fit (60 inches wide).

But there are also times when a product called Restor A Finish can work miracles. I have used it many times with great results. I have only had one instance that it didn't do the job.
