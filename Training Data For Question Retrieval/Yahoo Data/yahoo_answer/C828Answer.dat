Vitamin E has also been shown to reduce the risk of colon cancer, help decrease the severity and frequency of hot flashes in women going through menopause, and help reduce the development of diabetic complications. Vitamin E plays an important role in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Vitamin E is one of the main antioxidants found in cholesterol particles and helps prevent free radicals from oxidizing cholesterol.Selenium has been shown to induce DNA repair and synthesis in damaged cells, to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells, and to induce their apoptosis, the self-destruct sequence the body uses to eliminate worn out or abnormal cells. In addition, selenium is incorporated at the active site of many proteins, including glutathione peroxidase, which is particularly important for cancer protection. One of the body's most powerful antioxidant enzymes, glutathione peroxidase is used in the liver to detoxify a wide range of potentially harmful molecules.|`|KoJ0rddfaa	YEP! vitamin E, protein, some have fiber, so yeah, they r good
BWxSSADaaa	Absolutely!  For protein, their are plenty of other sources out there.  I actually never understand it when people object to vegetarianism on the grounds of "you won't get enough protein."  Most people get WAY more than they need, since the stuff is in most foods.  If you want dairy substitutes, there are "cheeses" and milk made from rice and nuts.  I like rice milk much more than soy milk, actually.  It just tastes better, in my opinion.|`|AA12031316	Sure, I do.  I also maintain my veg diet without wheat, corn, and nuts.  Do some research, explore ethnic foods from countries who don't consume what you want to avoid, and you will do fine.  It just takes research.|`|61ba79ff5c1542528d2b969d552d2fbeaa	Of course you can.  Just make sure to get plenty of protein from other sources.  I'm vegetarian myself, but no way I could live without soy, I just like it too much.|`|asXq2cFDaa	I BARELY eat any soy.  Personally, the meat industry puts out a lot of bs lies about soy...as well as the soy industry.  I think it is fine in moderation.|`|bfFNIBtIaa	Of course, as long as you make sure that eating enough protein rich foods from different sources: soy is by no means essential. For instance, I actually tend to prefer rice milk for some things now: I tend to get soya milk more because it's fortified and rice milk usually isn't. That said, there have been no proven major health risks from soy products as yet, despite the media trying to say that there might be every other day so they can sell newspapers. So if you do choose to eat or not to eat soy, I think you can do so with confidence either way.|`|Nk9jElJjaa	yeah you sure can. im a vegan (raw vegan actually) and i thrive without wheat, gluten, or soy products. its workin out well so far ! i think soy is an overrated "health" food and isn't as great for you as the industry leads you to believe.|`|gny47DLUaa	you definitely can!  i would find it extremely difficult though!|`|HSOp9J4Iaa	First of all you need to eat mostly RAW foods,   Spirulina and Hemp Seed protein is the must!!!!  goji Berries, Flex seed oil, Wheet shats, and reed the book  David Wolf "eating for beauty"

AA12012733	The exotic flavors, the fragrances, textures...and the beauty of how the food is presented.  One of the most phenomenal Indian restaurants is Saffron in Greensboro, North Carolina.    The lunch buffet looks like a party or banquet.  The last time I was there, they had a huge round platter filled with hot and spicy seafood and vegetables.  The shrimp were arranged around the edge of the dish like spokes. The dish also contained huge scallops, which were cooked perfectly.    The korma and chicken makahini also were out standing.

6DCQsdyuaa	dunk them in water with a few pinches of salt. then put them back in the fridge or freezer for 20 min|`|5zNwBQZHaa	There is no way to get veggies back to crunchy once they have been frozen and cooked.  The only think that I could think of that might help - is that if you thaw them before cooking, to keep them dry so that the water drips away.    But the freezing process causes some cells to rupture and lose their structure and moisture - resulting in soggy veggies.    You might try adding some fresh veggies - at least celery or canned water chestnuts  - to the mix so that the soggies aren't as noticeable.

I find it in Publix in the section next to Hot Dogs and blister-packed ham steaks and such.  It's pretty cheap too.    Cut a thick slice off (Like 3/4 of a inch or so) and sautee it in a pan to get it nice and browned on both sides.    Cut that up into small cubes (I make them a bit smaller than boullion cubes). and toss it in a bag in the fridge.    In the morning, I grab about half of the bag and toss it back into a pan to heat up. I go take a shower while this is happening. - I hate having to cook breakfast in the morning. :)    Then toss in 1/2 cup of egg beaters which I've found in something like this taste every bit as good as real eggs but save calories and cholesterol.    Toss in some fresh black pepper and a dash of salt and you've got good scrambled eggs and ham.  Some days I'll throw in some onion, green pepper, mushrooms etc or all of them.    Occasionally, when I'm not REALLY pushing for low-carbs I'll even use a burrito shell and roll it up into a wrap.     Ole brand burrito shells have 33g of carbs where many wraps have 40 or more. It's still a lot, so I save that for special occasions.    I hope that helps some.

I can't give up cookies and brownies so instead of giving up ANY food, I just take care of portion control. I split the cookie and finish it in 2-3 sessions. Because I fill up on salad and low cal soups, I eat the other things (pizza, burgers etc) half of my normal diet and stay full. drink loads of water but not during the meals. Water should be taken IN the food to keep full and never WITH the food. cook in less or no oil/butter as far as possible and sprinkle some on top instead for extra flavor.    Hope it helps, worked for me. All the best

That depends on a lot, including your body size, how much food you have eaten before and during, and how much alcohol you have drank.

Canned - same as frozen. Though tin peas really loose their color and go a grey sort of color.           Pre-Cut - fresh, pre-cut from the super-market (for when feeling lazy).           Fresh - cut into about 1 inch square pieces. Feel free to prepare the night before.           Meat  Legs (drumsticks), wings, maryland pieces. Even breast or thigh, if you don't like bones.  2?3?lb (11?kg) this will serve 4  6.           Flavouring  Your favourite flavour of tin soup. Use the Cream of ... type soups.     Alternatively use one of those Simmer Sauces  the ones you use for stir frys. We have found that the no name brand ones (which I dont like in stir frys), work well and; they are cheap. Try Honey Mustard         Optional Extras  Crushed garlic and/or ginger - teaspoon or two.  Herbs - best put in during last hour of cooking- teaspoon or two.  Salt and Pepper - added at end - to taste.           DIRECTIONS  Chuck the Vegies in first, put the chicken on top, pour in the soup and pop on the lid. Thats it. Nothing else.    Do not add any water, the enclosed slow cooking will retain heaps.    Add any of the optional extras.

AA12075083	Mini Chocolate Lava Cakes        1 ? cups semisweet chocolate chips   1 stick butter   1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract   1/2 cup sugar   3 tablespoons flour   1/4 teaspoon salt   4 eggs   butter cooking spray   1 tablespoon cocoa powder   8 strawberries, cut into slices- optional    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.   Microwave the chocolate and butter in the bowl for 2-3 minutes or until melted. Stir in vanilla.   In a large mixing bowl, combine sugar, flour and salt. Sift these into the chocolate and mix well with electric hand mixer. Add eggs one at time, fully incorporating each egg before adding the next. Beat at high until batter is creamy and lightens in color, approximately 4 minutes. Chill mixture for at least 2 hours.   Coat the top and each cup of the muffin tin with cooking spray. Dust with the cocoa powder and shake out excess. Spoon mixture into pan using a 4-ounce scoop or ladle. Bake for 10 to 11 minutes. Outsides should be cake-like and centers should be gooey. To remove: flip over tin onto a hard surface covered with wax paper. Top with strawberries.  *If serving, melt ? cup of semisweet chocolate chips and then drizzle over muffins; sprinkle with powdered sugar.|`|LGidAYDwaa	COCONUT CAKE  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.      Bake 1-2-3-4 cake. While it is baking, make the filling and put dry ingredients for the 7-minute frosting into a double boiler. Have boiling water ready (once it boils, turn it down to medium-high so it boils gently) to make the 7-minute frosting right after you assemble the cake with the filling.  Pour the 7-minute frosting over the cake - may add coconut to the frosting before or as you are pouring the frosting over the cake to keep the frosting from puddling around the cake.  Refrigerate.    1-2-3-4 Coconut Cake    1 Cup butter, room temperature  2 Cups sugar  4 eggs  3 Cups self-rising flour, sifted  1 Cup skim milk  1 teaspoon coconut extract  1 box (4-serving size) instant coconut cream pudding    Preheat oven to 350.  Grease and flour three 9-inch cake rounds.  Set up large pot:  boil water in pot (making sure that the water level isn't high enough to touch the bottom of the double boiler) and then turn it down to medium-high.  It needs to be just boiling - not too hot, not too cool.    With electric mixer, cream butter until fluffy.  Add sugar and continue to cream well for 6-8 minutes.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Whisk together the flour and pudding mix.  Add flour mixture and milk alternately to creamed mixture, beginning and ending with flour.  Add coconut extract and beat until just mixed.  Batter will be very thick.    Divide batter among the 3 cake pans. Drop pans onto countertop from 3 or 4 inches above the counter to remove any air bubbles (helps the cake stay level).  Bake for 25 - 30 minutes or until done.  (Use toothpick inserted near center of cake. If it comes out clean, the cake is ready.)      FILLING    3/4 Cup sugar  1 Cup sour cream  4 Tablespoons milk  3/4 cup flaked, sweetened coconut  1 teaspoon coconut extract    Stir together in bowl and set aside until cake is done.  Put bottom layer on cake serving plate and then use the wrong end of a wooden spoon to poke holes 1 inch apart over entire layer. Spread 1/3 filling over the layer. Repeat with second and third layer.    7-MINUTE FROSTING    1 1/2 Cup sugar  1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar  1/8 teaspoon salt  1/3 Cup water  2 egg whites  1 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract    While cake is baking, put sugar, cream of tartar, and salt into double boiler. Whisk together and set aside.  When cake is assembled, add water and egg whites to the double boiler and then put the double boiler over the boiling water.  Mix for 1 minute on low or until blended, then set mixer on high and beat it 7 minutes more, until frosting is done.  Remove from heat and beat in the coconut extract.    Pour over the cake after it cools a bit.  You can add coconut to the frosting or put coconut on the top layer of the cake before pouring the frosting over it to keep the frosting from sliding off the cake.  Sprinkle sides and top with more coconut.  Refrigerate.  Better after it sits for a day or so before serving.    I love lots of desserts, but this one is my fave.

AA12065568	Buy it in France. First of all, you'll have to pack it in your luggage that you check. The luggage people don't giv a crap about what you have in your bag and what they may be breaking when they toss your bags around. There's a good chance you'd end up with a couple of broken bottles and everything will smell like alcohol. Secondly, last time I was in France, you could buy alcohol if you were over 16 (It has been over 10 years since I've been there though, so that might have changed).|`|H8tITSaTaa	NO MAMES!!! why don't you instead jump to the subway tracks in mexico city?|`|LOWWquKkaa	Don't be ridiculous.

xrRZeROmaa	Yes, this is time consuming, so save it for a time when you can enjoy it. It is best served when less company is expected, because after tasting, it will be difficult sharing. You will not find this recipe on line. You must have the cook book in hand, or someone like me who has enjoyed this recipe so much as to be willing to hand enter it. You will not be disappointed with this one.    Tiramisu cheese cake    one plain or white Genoise cake    1/2 cup cake flour  1/4 cup cornstarch  3 large eggs plus 3 large egg yolks  3/4 cup sugar  Pinch of salt    One 9 X 2-inch deep round pan or a 9-inch springform pan, buttered, bottom lined with a disk of parchment or wax paper.      1. Set rack in the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.    2. Combine the cake flour and cornstarch and stir well to mix. Sift once and set aside. Whisk the eggs and yolks in the bowl of an electric mixer. Whisk in the sugar in a stream, then the salt.    3. Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water and gently whisk until the egg mixture is lukewarm. Whip by machine on high speed until the egg mixture is cold and increased in volume.    4. Remove the bowl from the mixer and sift the cake flour mixture over the egg mixture, in 3 or 4 additions, folding it in with a rubber spatula. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top evenly with a spatula.    5. Bake the layer for about 25 minutes, until well risen and firm to the touch.    6. Loosen the layer from the sides of the pan and invert to a rack; immediately re-invert to a rack so that the cake layer cools on the paper.    Storage: Double-wrap the layer in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for several days or freeze for several months.    Hint for success: Only heat the eggs and sugar to lukewarm or they will not whip to as great a volume and the cake will not rise well.        Tiramisu Cheesecake    1 recipe Plain Genoise baked in a 9 inch round pan (recipe above)      COFFEE BRANDY SYRUP    1/4 cup strong espresso coffee  2 tablespoons sugar  2 tablespoons brandy    MASCARPONE FILLING    1 pound (about 2 cups) mascarpone cheese  1 pound (16 ounces) cream cheese  1 cup sugar  3 eggs      1/2 teaspoon non- alkalized unsweetened cocoa powder    One 9 inch springform pan, buttered.      This fun variation on th classic Italian dessert is very much in the spirit of the original...... and it eliminates the raw or partially cooked eggs traditionally associated with tiramisu.    Storage: If you bake the cheesecake on the day you intend to serve it, keep it loosely covered at a cool room temperature after the cake has cooled. For longer storage, wrap in plastic and refrigerate up to several days. Bring the cheesecake to room temperature for an hour before serving.    1. Cool the Genoise.    2. For the syrup, combine the coffee, sugar, and brandy in a small bowl. Set aside.    3. Slice the Genoise into 2 layers. Place the bottom of the cake layer in the prepared pan, gently pushing the sides of the cake to meet the sides of the pan. Cut the rest of the cake into 1/2 inch dice; Place in a bowl and sprinkle with the coffee syrup. Set aside.    4. Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F.    5. To make the filling, your mixer should always be set on the lowest speed. Use the paddle attachment, if your mixer has one, to beat the cream cheese smooth, no more than 30 seconds. Stop the mixer and scrape the bowl and beater (or paddle). Add the sugar in a stream, mixing for no more than 30 seconds. Stop and scrape. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing only until each is absorbed. Stop and scrape after each addition. In a large mixing bowl, gently soften the mascarpone cheese with a rubber spatula until it is smooth. By hand, fold the cream cheese mixture into the mascarpone cheese.    6. Wrap aluminum foil around the bottom of the springform pan so it comes at least 1" up the sides. Pour one half of the filling into the prepared pan over the Genoise layer. Top the filling with the diced Genoise, then pour on the rest of the filling. Through a fine strainer, sprinkle the top of the cake with the cocoa powder. Place the pan in a jelly-roll or roasting pan and pour warm water into the jelly-roll pan to a depth of 1/2"    7. Bake the cheesecake for about 55 minutes, or until lightly colored and firm except for the very center. Remove from the jelly-roll pan of hot water.    8. Remove the foil and cool completely on a rack. Wrap the cheesecake and chill overnight before unmolding.    SERVING: Serve small wedges    STORAGE: If you bake the cheesecake on the day you intend to serve it, keep it loosely covered at a cool room temperature after the cake has cooled.

It seems that wanting to feel full all the time is what got us into this situation to begin with! :-)    Like when the next time you feel you are hungry but it isn't time on your food plan to eat next - ask yourself what is the worst thing that is going to happen if you don't eat until your next meal?  It can't be that bad, can it?  Then go do something to occupy your mind (not something passive like TV, go do something outside, etc)     I'm thinking that it would be counterproductive to want to feel full all the time when you are trying to lose weight.  I think it is a good thing to find those times that you are hungry and be happy in those times because when your tummy is empty and your body is using body-fat for fuel - those are the only times we are losing weight.    All this assumes you have a healthy eating plan and are not starving yourself.  After a while of healthier eating on a balance diet, you will get used to those time when you are hungry.  It takes a while - but it does happen.|`|nUbtafV6aa	fish eggs try salads and eat lots of fruit but warnings fruits pack lots of sugars good energy food if your not exercising none of this may help good luck|`|Re3PSAAXaa	if you drink 2 cups of water before that  will make you less hungry you   will lose more Weight

I inserted bun instructions for you between [[  ]]  double brackets.  Good luck    Basic Bread Dough     INGREDIENTS:       3 cups all purpose flour (plus up to one additional cup of flour for kneading)    3 tablespoons sugar    1? teaspoons salt    ? cup instant dry milk    1 Tablespoon (Rapid Rise) Yeast (or one packet)      1 1/8 cup water heated to 110-120o    4 Tablespoons melted butter (half stick)    Pam Spray or other cooking spray oil.      DIRECTIONS:        In a large bowl, mix together all dry ingredients.    Add heated water and melted butter, and mix together with wooden spoon.    Shake 1 tablespoon (plus) of the additional flour on a clean flat dry surface.       Flour your hands.    Dump dough out onto floured surface and begin to knead in small amounts of        additional flour until the dough is no longer sticky in the hands and does         not stick to the counter. As dough begins to stick to the work surface, scrape        it up with a bench-scraper or back of a spatula.  Discard dry bits.    Spray PAM cooking spray into a large bowl.    When dough is smooth and elastic and no longer sticky, place dough in bowl and turn         it over so there is an oily top on the dough.  Cover bowl with clean cloth.    Set oven for 350o for ONE MINUTE. Shut off.    Put dough in oven and let it sit (up to one hour) until it is doubled in size.    Remove dough from oven.    Set oven for 350o for ONE MINUTE. Turn it off.    Spray bottom and sides of a standard loaf pan. Be generous. Get good coverage.    Punch down dough so it deflates.  Create a tube of dough about the size of your           bread pan.  Stretch and pull the sides and ends, folding under, until the top          of loaf is free of cracks, etc. The top of the loaf should be smooth. Place          dough into well greased bread pan.

5zNwBQZHaa	Yes, you can freeze them.  In fact the poppers in fast food restaurants (and some regular restaurants with lousy food) come in to them pre-made and frozen.    However - you may notice some loss of quality in the end product since you are baking them and not frying them.  They may get a little soggy when baked after freezing and the cheese may not be as creamy.    From a food-safety perspective, this would be OK to do, keep them in the freezer for no more than 2-3 months as long as they are in the coldest part of the freezer.      Best bet?  Next time you make some - freeze a few.  The best way to do that is to line a plate with wax paper or plastic wrap - place the poppers on the plate with room in between them (no touching) and put them in the freezer just like that for a 4 hours.  After that - they should be frozen, take them out and quickly wrap them in plastic wrap and then either put them in a a freezer bag or foil - and back into the freezer.    Take them out after  a month and see how they taste.    Good luck!|`|YdjX5fOWaa	So I realize you can buy frozen jalapeno poppers at the store and they're are fine.  The difference between yours and theirs is that you don't have special food preservatives to help the freezing and defrosting process.      I've never had much success with freezing anything homemade with cream cheese in it.  I find that when I defrost it or cook it afterward, the cream cheese will separate and get weird.  Not like, you're going to get food poisoning weird, but strange consistency and taste.  But every recipe is different.  I say give it a shot, and in a few days see how they do.  Let me know if it works out and then give me the recipe... that sounds good!|`|53giV6PFaa	Sure - store them in an air-tight freezable container.  They sell frozen poppers at the grocery store, so I don't see why homemade ones can't be frozen too.

Specifically using a sweetened condensed milk, eggs and lime juice filling in a graham cracker crust    And contrary to the thumbs up the lime zest poster has indicated, please DO NOT USE LIME ZEST  Key lime pie is a creamy custard like pie.

H9k65Ve0aa	I like to boil them in a lot of seasonings, like; salt pepper, garlic, onion,  thyme, 5-spice, beef bouillon, green bell pepper until tender and done. Then take them out of boiling pot and pour your favorite bbq sauce on them and place in the oven for 20. mins. A good semi-homemade sauce is, your favorite bbq sauce, green bell peppers, onions, 5-spice and boil until vegetables are tender|`|hDNGz2Z5aa	ish...|`|TpO8GHCtaa	Try cooking the pork in water with salt & pepper & 1 clove of garlic.Cook until the meat is done & can be taken from the bone easily.  You can then add bbq sauce to the meat..warm it through & have BBQ pork sanwiches.|`|53giV6PFaa	Try Pork Neck Bones and Rice.        * about 2? pounds of fresh pork neck bones      * ? cup cooking oil      * 2 cups rice      * 1 Tbsp garlic powder      * 2 tsps salt      * 1 tsp black pepper      * 6 cups of water      * 1 onion, sliced      * ? bunch of chopped green onions, about 4     Directions:  Use the ? cup of cooking oil and brown the neckbones, turning them frequently.  When the neckbones are browned, add the chopped green onion, the sliced onion and the spices.  Add water and bring to boil.  Cover pot with tight-fitting lid and simmer on low for 1? hours. Stir once or twice.  After 1? hours of simmering, add rice. Skim fat if desired.  Simmer 15 more minutes and turn off fire. Stir once.  Wait 15 more minutes and eat.
rsTB7D1zaa	You shouldn't be looking in a grocery store.  You would end up finding things like "cooking sherry" which is a low grade dry sherry with salt added.  This will not taste good and will make an otherwise edible meal inedible.    Instead, I reccomend you visit a liquor store or a wine store -- depending on how your state works.  Good places to find sherry in a liquor/wine store would be in the Spain section, since it is a Spanish fortified wine.  If the store is organized by varietal instead, then you would want to look near the port wine, as that is a fortified wine like sherry is (though you cannot substitute port for sherry).    Not every bottle will say dry, sherry comes in a few different variations.  There is generally dry, medium-dry, and cream.  This refers to the amount of sugar in it (sherry is commonly drank after a meal and tends to be sweeter than most dinner wines).  If it does not specifically say, you should assume it is dry (low in sugar).  The other two will say that they are either medium-dry or "cream" (no actual dairy of course).     Good luck.  Also, try googling "Sherry" and look under the shopping section.  This should give you an idea on what the bottles tend to look like, how they're labeled and the price range.  You don't need to spend more than $20, that's for sure.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Ask them at the grocery store, where the dry sherry is.  It may, or may not, be labeled "dry" sherry; but the cream sherries WILL be labeled "cream".  It should be by itself, but maybe next to the white wines|`|WxoZrTPlaa	Don't look in the alcohol section, but in the cooking section.  It is often found by the vinegars and/or oils.|`|ypB3QDWNaa	Cheryl A is right.  You will not find it the wine section, but in the area that has vinegars and oils.  Holland House is probably the best and most widely available for cooking, link provided.  The label says nothing about being 'dry', but it is considered a dry sherry.

The answer is yes it will help loose some (or maintain weight) as if part of your stomach is filled with tea it will obviously occupy the space where food would go therefore you'll eat less than usual and should loose some weight (providing you don't make up for it later in snacks) as tea digests quicker than food and you may feel hungry sooner.<br>  The right way to loose weight, I assure you this as it worked for me.<br>  Eat a lot slower chewing food for longer put your fork down while chewing (chew like around 20 times) you will find you will feel full quickly, that alone will start making you loose weight as you'll eat less also digestion starts at your mouth chewing longer helps to a more efficient burning of the food, secondly exercise 3-4 time a week 2 aerobics one weight training sessions of only about 40 minutes to 60 minutes with a day in between rest...make this a lifestyle and I guarantee you will loose weight...but it will take time persevere for at least 6 months  ...good luck   :D  xx|`|AA11786341	I   drink it because it is good for you,not to lose weight

There are many folklore stories about this one. The first story is that the spices must soak for 65 days. The second story is about the Indian soldiers who needed something quick and easy during a war in 1965 and the unanimous choice of the soldiers was to have deep-fried boneless chicken pieces dipped in yogurt and spices - the chicken 65. The third story we know is about someone who used 65 dried red chilies to make the chicken hot.

doz7RIoeaa	These are my own take on this based on personal views and that of some friends who work for drug companies    For vanity products and food - It has to stop. There is no reason why cosmetics and candy bars have to be tested on animals. The problem is the legal system where people can sue anyone and any company because they are somehow dissatisfied with the product they bought. Laws need to be changed that would protect companies from nuisance lawsuits. Until then, many companies will test on something or someone to make sure they can't be sued or limit their liability if they are.      Medicine - while some doctors and researchers disagree with testing, the industry itself does not have a choice. By law, they need to test extensively before they are allowed to market products. This includes testing at the cellular level then moving progressively to animal then human volunteer testing. There are improved and effective computer model programs and software that many companies have already been using, The problem with that  it's only as good as the programmer(s) that created it. And while animal testing is not 100% effective, it does give an insight to how a drug will within a living tissue,  And again, as long as people keep suing, drug companies will and have to protect themselves.   However, ther are medicines and procedures that have existed and been proven effetive for morethan 50 years. These drugs do not need to be tested on animals nor are animals needed to to teach such procedures to new doctors.     In my opinion, the best way to protect animals if you are so inclined, is to change the laws and guidelines for testing. As long as it is legal to do so, companiess will continue to use animals to test their products.|`|b9uOax0aaa	Test on death row inmates.|`|DFXS4SB4aa	http://www.geari.org/alternatives-to-ani...|`|asXq2cFDaa	http://www.nih.gov/news/health/feb2008/n...  :)  Also, to shoot back at that remark, tell her how many companies already do not test on animals, such as Revlon, J/A/S/O/N, iss my face, well, here is a list for you!  http://www.caringconsumer.com/pdfs/compa...  lol, its a lot!    Edit:I do have to agree some what with animal testing for medicines. Then again most animal testing is does for random other things like makeup and shampoo's!!  I think Animal testing should be done more humanely.|`|3vBALAlaaa	I have also done a project on animal abuse!!    O.k! So you should probably mention that they eat dogs in Asia. First, they trap the dog. Then they put a way-too-tight band around their mouths. Then, they put them in a small cage with about 13 other dogs, so they can't even sit down properly. Then, one by one, they drag the dog away, to a slow and painful death. Bon Appatiet!     Also, you should look up serious cases of animal abuse, such as the guy in Kansas that shot a dog, kicked the dog, shot the dog repetitively while gutting it, and then finally gave up because, shockingly, the dog died. Mention the punishment from animal abuse.     I also Google'd famous animal abusers, such as mass murderers and cannibals, that used to abuse animals, some would even set cats and dogs on fire, others would drown them.     To answer your question, you could test people. People sign up for testing, so why not for make up? Couldn't they also test it for harmful chemicals instead of on animals? Hope I've helped! Good luck on the project.     One more thing though. In my project, I had pictures that literally made my audience shocked, you could hear it! Like I started it off with an abused beagle, that was burnt by it's owner.

I would suggest movies, G-rated truth or dare, all of those trust games like falling into the arms of the person behind you, a good menu (pizza, ice cream, candy, etc.), and makeovers (if they're girly girls). You can phsyc them all out with promises of pranks to whoever falls asleep first (we used to draw cat faces with eyeliner that will come off with makeup remover). In the morning send them off with a rockin' breakfast. Pancakes, bagels, waffles, whatever they want!

BWxSSADaaa	It can be hard with no good fresh produce, but I suggest you also check out the canned goods and frozen foods sections of your grocery store.  Get things like beans, beets, chick peas, canned peeled whole tomatoes, frozen corn (the only organic kind I can find ANY time of year), frozen peas, chopped frozen spinach, and frozen fruits of any kind.  I live in France now and here it is so easy to find frozen fruits and veggies that don't have any added salt or sugar, but I remember in the States it was hard.  Usually I had to buy from Whole Foods (I like it, but it's expensive sometimes).  Frozen and canned goods sometimes have even more vitamins than fresh, because they are picked at the peak of harvest and then preserved.  Some veggies you can find even in the winter, like cabbage, carrot, onion and potatoes, others too.  I especially love to make soups using a large can of whole peeled tomatoes.  I chop the tomatoes and use the juice to make a broth.    I have a food blog with lots of recipes on it if you're interested in taking a look.  It isn't a vegetarian blog, but most of the recipes have ended up being vegetarian, since it's how I usually tend to eat: http://rozminsrecipes.blogspot.com|`|geih5vR8aa	I came up with a great pasta dish the other night. I got it from Chicken Florentine, which is chicken that is stuffed with cheese and spinach. You can do it two ways, one Vegan (red sauce), one Vegetarian (Alfredo sauce)....

Coat the bottom of a pan with Extra virgin Olive Oil, and saute a chopped white onion, and about 3-5 cloves of minced garlic together on a medium heat.      Then add 2 Tbsp of Balsamic Vinegar  -Next add about 2-3 Tbsp of tomato paste  -then a 28 oz can of tomato puree  -and one can smaller can of diced tomatoes    season it up with salt and pepper, and a package of spaghetti seasoning. If you don't have that, you can use italian seasonings.    Cook your pasta, and towards the last 2 minutes of cooking, you can add a box of frozen spinach (I think a 10 oz box), that has been thawed out... AND, some fresh basil.  --- you can also add other things to it, like capers, or kalamata olives... etc.|`|BIwZ7klfaa	BBQ ribs are good

05b4e14c99d9501231c3f4a12a609559aa	One of the most interesting and peculiar nutrients found in peanuts is Resveratrol: this is a natural antimicrobial agent, produced by the peanut plant (and in even larger quantities by red grapes) to ward off potential pathogens (bacteria, virii and fungi).  Resveratrol is actually believed to be the cause of the "French paradox" (French people having a lower risk of cardiovascular disease despite their diet rich in fats). Although harmless to humans, resveratrol is still active when ingested, and it provides the same anti-microbial and anti-fungal properties to the person consuming it. Academic research has shown a plethora of beneficial effects of resveratrol in mice, ranging from anti-cancer, antiviral, anti-aging, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory to life-prolonging (most of these tests have not been carried out on humans yet, but the premises are there).    Another peculiar substance contained in peanut butter is p-coumaric acid, a polyphenol that helps combat oxidative stress (a syndrome believed to cause some neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases). Scientific sources such as the Food Chemistry concluded that roasting peanuts leads to a higher content in p-coumaric acid by as much as 22%.    Preventing Gallstones and Alzheimer  In a test conducted during 20 years, on 80,000 female subjects by the Nurses' Health Study, it was observed that women who eat least 1 ounce of nuts, peanuts or peanut butter each week have a 25% lower risk of developing gallstones. This quantity can easily be reached by eating one peanut butter sandwich per week!    According to the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, the niacin contained in peanuts, when eaten regularly, provides protection against Alzheimer's disease.  The study was carried on 3000 elder men (65 or older) from Chicago, who were interviewed about their diet and subsequently tested for cognitive skills: those getting 22mg of niacin/day were 70% less likely to have developed Alzheimer's disease than those consuming 13 mg/day.    In addition to this, peanut butter contains much higher quantities of antioxidants than apples or carrots.    All things considered, peanut butter deserves a place in a healthy diet for the vast range of important nutrients it contains.  Because of its high fat and caloric content, however, some doctors argue that obese people should consume only little amounts of it: there is a lot of controversy about this, and there are many studies claiming that eating nuts more than twice a week actually reduces the risk of weight gain.|`|INPrlW6Maa	Peanut Butter Cookies|`|K1mI3Rxgaa	cheerios and peanut butter  to make peanut butter squares or balls they r good|`|IuyO9Vq2aa	PB&J =D|`|pVdV4gwgaa	PB&J  Peanut butter cookies  peanut butter frosting (on yellow cake or chocolate)|`|lMHy05Lmaa	u can use it 2 get gum out of your hair|`|AA10541300	1.

FvhCUHjxaa	Sometimes meat makes your stomach upset; I'm trying to convert to vegetarianism but when I have a steak my stomach hurts so badly that I have nausea, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. IBS and Acid Reflux could have something to do with it. What else have you eaten today? I suffer from Acid Reflux as well and Apple Cider vinegar has been working for me, you should try it! I hope you feel better soon! =]|`|llkSmgLJaa	Please call your doctor about this. Something else could be wrong. Your statement - "feels like someone is punching me in the gut." makes me wonder.

Does that makes sense? Also, if you have Acid Reflux, than you should takes some medication. By the way, make sure that you're still getting protein. I don't believe in vegetarianism because i think that God gave us animals for a reason, and  we should eat them, but hey, I'm not you. Vegetarians need to be cautious of their diet, so you have to monitor VERY CAREFULLY your diet, making sure your consuming all the food groups.|`|kMK9E2a7aa	Well, the obvious and sensible thing to do is to go and see your doctor.There is no point in asking such questions on here and getting incorrect answers.|`|doz7RIoeaa	Any food can make your stomach upset for a variety of reasons. From allergic reaction or a pre-existing condition (like you described) or  spoilage/contamination or improper preparation etc. For example, soy milk that has not been cooked properly is toxic.   If you are trying to become a vegetarian for animal welfare issues, the reason could just be psychosomatic. In other words, your mind is telling you that it's wrong so your body is rebelling against it.   For peace of mind, visit your doc. It could be a symptom of something more serious or it could be nothing. But better safe than sorry.|`|0vfTitxAaa	i went veg for a month. i had meat on the 31st day and i almot threw up. it was awful. i couldn't eat meat for a couple weeks after. i had to build myself up to it.|`|geih5vR8aa	I know when people don't eat meat for a period of time, then they go eat a cheeseburger, then they get sick.

Mix flour mixture gradually into butter/egg mixture along with milk.    Gently stir in remaining ingredients. (Do not overmix or bread will be tough).

Blueberry Cinnamon Roll Bread Pudding    About 6 cups of day old cinnamon rolls, cut into cubes  6 eggs  2 cups milk  4 tbsp maple syrup  1 cup of fresh blueberries  Coarse sugar  Maple syrup for serving    The night before you want to serve your bread pudding, mix the eggs, milk and maple syrup in a large bowl. Arrange the cinnamon roll pieces in a buttered 9 x 13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle your blueberries over the cinnamon rolls. Pour the egg mixture over the cinnamon rolls and blueberries. Press lightly with your hands, making sure the rolls are mostly covered with the custard. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator overnight.    The next morning, when you're ready to bake, preheat your oven to 375F. Sprinkle your bread pudding with some coarse sugar and bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until it is golden and the custard is set. Serve warm with maple syrup.      Also, I love this Fiongarde.  It's a cross between a pudding and cake.  A twist on the French dessert clafoutti.    I'll accept that as long as they're willing to admit that this simple dessert - a cross between a pudding and a cake - is one of the glories of the French peasant table. It's best served warm and eaten the day it's made.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Generously butter or spray a 9-inch flan or cake pan. Set aside.  2) Combine sugar and egg yolks in a large bowl; beat at medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes, or until eggs are thick and lemon colored. Add whole egg and mix to combine. Add butter, a tablespoon at a time, beating to incorporate after each addition. Reduce speed to low; beat in flour, salt, then milk and, finally, lemon zest, lemon juice and vanilla extract.  3) Pour batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle berries over top of batter; press down lightly. Bake for about 40 minutes, or until the batter sets and top is brown. Cool slightly. Dust with confectioners' sugar. Serve warm.

teIblDHiaa	Bagels are not healthy because they are very dense in calories, specifically calories coming from carbohydrates. For instance, 1 bagel is equivalent to eating 4 slices of bread. Not too many people know that! Also, bagels are usually made using white flour, so their isn't enough fiber to slow down the digestion of the bagel. This means that all of those carbs you are eating are going right into your bloodstream. So it spikes your insulin levels and gives you a sugar rush, especially if you like to eat your bagel with jam or jelly. Adding cream cheese slows down the absorption process (because it contains fat which is sort of like a buffer), but it still has an adverse effect on your blood sugar levels. This is because you are still intaking too many carbs, so the fat can only do so much.    Also, most people like their bagels with lots of cream cheese, like 4 spoons of it. That's way too much. People forget that cream cheese is a spread and is not meant to be piled on. This leads to an extremely high fat intake (specifically from saturated fats), which we all know is not good for us. But I would say that eating a bagel with no cream cheese is worse than eating a bagel with some cream cheese because of the buffer effect that fats have on the absorption of the sugars.|`|DoN0ayEFaa	Bagels are hard and compact bread. Plain bagels don't have sugar in them. You just have to chew them more for them to be digested easier.|`|zQbpJmESaa	What's the Deal With: The Bagel Diet  Brent Buckman, attorney and former contestant on The Apprentice swears by his new diet: The Bagel Diet.

Well, vegetarians can eat things that everyone else does, with some adjustments: for example, pizza, casseroles, grilled items, pastas, are all very much options for vegetarians.  Think about recipes you usually make at home, and then just imagine them without the meat.  A lot of them probably don't look that different!  But, so she has some options and can experiment: make sure to have beans around, they can add bulk to a meal, are good for you, non expensive and easy to store.  You can also get bags of fresh baby spinach, it has lots of protein and vitamins (including iron, important).  She/you can use this to cook, or to make awesome salads.  Basically, buy all the fruits and veggies you and she are interested in trying or already like.  Even though they're a little pricey, you may once in a while get her a frozen Amy's meal.  This brand is fantastic!  The food is really tasty and may give you ideas for new things to cook.  When I was in high school, I hardly ate meat, and Amy's meals were a once a week treat.  They also make soups and pasta sauces.  Best idea of all, though, is to go to the store together.  You'll get her input, and you'll get to spend time with your daughter.  (Cherish it, before the Dark Ages, oops, I mean teenage years start!)  The site for Amy's brand is http://www.amys.com|`|9HRkwzruaa	I know how you feel...my son went veg when he was 9, and I came on here asking the same question :)    Make sure that she has enough iron, protein, calcium, and B vitamins; if she's eating dairy and eggs, this is a lot easier.  I would also recommend a good multi-vitamin if she's not already taking one...Michael's PreTeen Girl is awesome.  It will both give her many of the nutrients she needs and help with the oncoming mood swings :)  (My 11yo son takes the PreTeen Boy formula, that stuff is gold.)    Morningstar products are great and readily available; fresh fruits and veggies are also terrific.  (They taste so much better than canned or frozen, and kids this age tend to enjoy cooking with them.)  Pizza with various fruits and veggies, creative pastas, tacos and enchiladas with veggie crumbles (from Morningstar), and ethnic dishes (Mexican, Asian, Italian) are all hits with this age.  If she likes to cook, there should be some good veg kids' cookbooks at your public library - I bet she'll find some recipes that she'll love!    Overall, be her advocate.  If kids rag on her for being veg, be her strength.  Let her know that you're proud of her for being responsible about her decision, and support her whether it's temporary or long-term.|`|AA12031316	Good for you, dad!  I highly recommend that the two of you make a real bonding experience out of this-go to the library or book store and get some cookbooks-there are some amazing veggie recipes out there.  My daughter and I started cooking together (I think she was around 7 when she went veggie), and now, at 14 she is quite the accomplished chef and is still at my side in the kitchen.  We love to pour through cookbooks and go shop for the ingredients together.  If you plan on still eating meat, just find ways to add that into some of her recipes after her portion has been taken out.  That way, you are both honoring your choices, but supporting eachother's at the same time. Good on you!  She is lucky to have you for a dad.|`|bVsRXAapaa	are you kidding me?? the girl is 11 frickin years old!!!! 11 yr olds dont have the capability to make a choice like that lol. be a father!!! my goodness.|`|Dzr2ZcdZaa	im 16 and im a vegetarian. first off you need to make sure shes getting enough iron. VERRY important. secondly alot of the boca and morningstar foods are really good found in the frozen section|`|VH29BFuGaa	Haha awesome. Nice to see supportive parents :)    To stay healthy I recommend getting nuts, tofu, soy milk  lots of nice fruits and vegetables. Green leafy ones are  good for iron. There's heaps of info if you look it up  on Google or any search engine.|`|bfFNIBtIaa	It's a rare father who supports his daughter's choice like this.  Makes a change from the heavy handed "I just know best, don't question me" authoritarian approach of some other fathers and mothers that often happens when their offspring disagrees with them on anything. Well done guy: your daughter has a very special dad.    It may be temporary: it may be not. Or, as someone else has pointed out, it might be temporary, then she might resume it again later on. Who knows? So it's probably best to get well educated on vegetarian diets and eating. I'd defintely visit vegsoc.org and veganhealth.org for more info about nutrition on veggie diets.    In general though, make sure your daughter gets plenty of complex carbs, and calcium, protein, and iron rich foods. I'm thinking wholewheat breads and pastas, potatoes, brown rice etc. as base for meals. That's along with plenty of different types of beans and pulses, tofu, and lots of different fruits and vegetables (dark leafy greens like kale, spinach and chinese greens in particular), these being great for calcium and iron which are needed in puberty at perhaps a greater time than any other period of growth. Make sure cereals and the like are fortified if you can: fortified juices, and fortified soya or cow's milk (depending on your preference, although I'd go for soya over cow's milk anyday) in liberal amounts are good too. Nuts are great in moderate amounts too.    Not sure how to put these into your daughter's diet? Check the Internet for recipes if need be: you'll find tonnes incorporating foods like these in veggie meals. You can get lots of vegetables and beans and the like into meals like casseroles, stews, chilli, burritos, stir fries, curries and the like, depending on your daughter's and your family's tastes. If the whole family can eat similar sometimes too, that's going to be great (if planned right) for all your health, and your wallet too.    Good luck to yous guy: hope all goes well for you.

IHsuI8mJaa	Oh! Have everyone come dressed like their favorite girl character from a chick flick. Like Ally from The Notebook, or something like that. And have it just allllll girly things. And play games like "Truth," do makeovers. And if you're drinking- there are a ton of fun drinking games to play with your girlfriends. Eat food that you'd normally eat while watching a chick flick- like a carton of ice cream for each girl. lol. And make smoothie and drink out of wine galsses lol.  & Make a mix CD of love songs and girl songs. Like "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" & "Single Ladies (Put a ring on it) Have fun! ?|`|9ZOWeuPRaa	A trivia game sounds great! Thats a really good idea. I recently hosted a tea party for 16-17 year old girls and I organised a treasure hunt around my house with cyptic clues and at the end the winner won a prize. The prize was a photoframe filled with photos of all my friends. It was a really cheap present to make and everyone loved it! Fairy Bread is a good food to serve because it takes everyone back to their childhood. You could also have a theme (for the food) like italian (pizza, pasta etc) or mexican (burritos, nachoes, virgin-margiritas) or even something thats along the same theme as the chick flick theme (if your favourite chich flick is british then serve British food etc). For movies you could stick to old classics like Breakfast at tiffanys, Dirty Dancing, Chocolat, Love Actually, Four Weddings and a funeral. Or you could have some lessen known movies like Benny and Joon, Priceless. Romeo and juliet, Bridget jones diary and Pride and prejudice are also great movies for a chick flick night.|`|vNi14C7uaa	FOOD: Your parents could order pizza or maybe you could go out to your favorite resturant. Whenever you r back at home you could get chicken wings, chips and dip, have some cupcakes or something already made, or make some cookies or cinnamon rolls.    ENTERTAINMENT: If you have a Wii yall can play that. Board games are okay. If you have music maybe have dance competitions against each other. Take pictures, watch a movie { like before going to sleep so nobody gets bored}, talk about boys, and if you like skating maybe your parents will let you go skating or if a good movie is out then, go to the movies.    I hope I helped out! Plz choose me for best answer!!|`|wPLPMQEqaa	For foods just try to stick to finger foods.  Ex: rotel dip, cheese & crackers, & cheetos.  try to stay away from peanut butter if you can, because of the salmonella (misspelled?) poisoning.    Life would probably be a fun game, and clue.     For prizes, try to keep it cheep, and fun. Dollar tree would be a good place to get them.    Some movies would be Sleepover, Thirteen, Mean Girls, Made of Honor, The House Bunny.
zQbpJmESaa	Olivio butter made with extra light olive oil is a very close second to real butter. I am a huge butter fan but I can handle this stuff. Do I prefer butter? Yeah, I do but of all the butter- subsitutes Ive tried this is by far the best. Its an easy switch- try it! AND, its a lot cheaper than butter- God bless the Mediterranean!|`|XHnpraaxaa	There is no such thing as no calorie butter.  Butter is a natural food and full of calories.  You can get a sub for it like ICNBINB.  I cannot Believe it is Not Butter has a spray and for 5 sprays there is no calories.  This is what is allowed on the Medical Weight Loss program.|`|AA11402528	ive heard of this product called molly mcbutter but im not sure what that is. theres no calorie butter spray too.
ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	No, but you will never be able to conceal that level of dumbness, which is lucky for you, not illegal.    They don't have to breathalyze you, they'll say they smell it. The cops can be pretty good at telling if you're under the influence of something, especially if your driving gives them a reason to pull you over. You can still get arrested and thrown in the can for the night under suspicion of driving under the influence, which may result in charges and having to be bailed out. If you have any weed or paraphernalia in your car, it could easily be searched. You could be charged with more than one thing and be lucky just to end up with a D.U.I.|`|xrRZeROmaa	No, but unless you are eating it, they can sniffalyzer your breath and clothing for it.  In fact usually your hair will retain the odor.    I used to work retail, and I could smell it on the customers who smoked, quite easily, not to mention the red-eye affect.  Mustached and bearded men were the worst for carrying the odor around with them, wool winter clothing was next in line.|`|UbXp2K26aa	LMAO NO ARE U STUPID  the breathalyzer is meant to test blood alcohol levels haha  methinks you smoke so much dope you're becoming a dope|`|AA12000585	no. there's no way to tell your thc level by your breath|`|SEqVvFUyaa	NOPE your good dude.  :D  good stuff!|`|EVX17AjRaa	No they can give you a piss test but they cant use a breathalyzer on you.
54a71494855e0d728b9ec00aab8ff5cfaa	Sulphured molasses is just a little bit stronger flavored than unsulphured, You might want to cut back just a tiny bit on the amount, due to the stronger flavor but it will cook the same.|`|dbw210qqaa	no, either one will work
zIXReHyTaa	Buy a cupcake online and copy their packaging.|`|pVdV4gwgaa	clear plastic containers!|`|1a0dd1f150b75398f59e352ab2df9279aa	why would you want to do that?  just sell them locally instead of going through all that trouble
XHnpraaxaa	There not good for you so why would you want a large package?  To many fats and way to much sugar.  Causes health problems.  Read the package if you do not want to believe it.  Better off having a peanut butter sandwich and also that would save you money.

qpxPW5paaa	Stuff you can find anywhere  Vodka-Stoli or Grey Goose  Rum-Captain Morgans or Appleton Estate|`|nrNrLuawaa	for vodka a nice less costly bottle is Fris or Svedka  rum Flor de Cana gold or Cruzan|`|geih5vR8aa	best Vodka, Prolly Grey Goose or Belvedere... at least as far as American's are concerned. It's pretty much the best one I've had. I know in Europe, like in Russia, they are supposed to have amazing Vodka's.    Straight rum? I'm not sure. If you go to a specialty liquor store, they can point you in the right direction there.  Sailor Jerry is a good spiced rum, and it's pretty damn cheap. English Harbour is supposed to be good. Around $25/bottle (it's a dark rum)... Rhum Clement Premire Canne Rum is $28.99 (it's a light rum).     Now, if you want a great Whiskey, Try one by Old Rip Van Winkle. It's a special blend called Pappy Van Winkle, special reserve. It is about $100 per bottle and I was told has received one of the highest ratings in taste testing... it even beats out higher priced whiskey's.  They have a 15, 20 and 23 year reserve. They're normal Van Winkle fam rsv 23 year, is $240, and it's not rated higher than the pappy van winkle.

AA12092525	I was very nervous, afraid of messing up ETC...=)|`|XHnpraaxaa	You put this in the wrong section.   This is for food and drink questions.
