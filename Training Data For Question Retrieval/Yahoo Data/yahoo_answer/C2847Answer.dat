htKJTXubaa	What's the price range? A chain restaurant or privately owned one?
cb2f95bedee3d8d655699404a5b1fe8aaa	Whole foods...sadly is probably the best bet. Dosum's noodle house in mid city may have something for you. Nirvana has some indan vegitarian food...but good luck getting help from the wait staff ( they hate women it seems) check out Taj Mahal in Metairie. But i am a meat eater so i may be wrong bout the nonwhole foods suggestions!|`|pbV7dnKKaa	You cn always look at an online yellow pages to find vegetarian places that only serve Vegan! There are three that are in New Orleans that you can try out that you might like. Dooky Chase, Mandarin House, Nirvana Indian Cuisine all serve vegetarian, see which one has food you might like!|`|mEcJUfEqaa	This why  Veganism is such a dumb religion.  If you don't eat meat, what do you care about "good food" anyway?<br>  <br>  I suppose Cajun red beans and rice would qualify, and your skin won't be too yellow, or legs too bowed.
loZL2ogzaa	they can b used for fud<br>  <br>  here, you can use my used ones ;D|`|AA10396911	A sanitary napkin is a slightly modified version of the traditional napkin or "serviette" <br>  <br>  Traditionally, one uses a napkin for the expressed purpose of removing excess food or, in some cases, sauce from ones facial region. Sanitary napkins however are generally kept to the hands and lap regions. <br>  <br>  Some believe that a sanitary napkin has a rougher surface, and as such should not be applied to more sensistive facial skin.|`|zzO6Qalsaa	are you really serious?|`|T55YPfXUaa	sanitary are usually called pads. they are not the same as normal napkins.|`|Yrz6Pc69aa	A sanitary towel, sanitary pad, sanitary napkin, Maxi pad (U.S.), menstrual pad, or pad is an absorbent item worn by a woman while she is menstruating, recovering from vaginal surgery, for lochia (post birth bleeding), abortion, or any other situation where it is necessary to absorb the flow of menses from one's vagina.<br>  <br>  These pads are not to be confused with incontinence pads, which are worn by men or women who have urinary incontinence problems or experience stress incontinence. An incontinence pad is a similar item to a menstrual pad, perhaps with a high absorbency. Menstrual pads may be used by some people for this purpose.|`|RI7uLf7zaa	it's a napkin that uses the word sanitary to make you buy it. it's no different than any other napkin|`|T6d1NOwMaa	Is there health class in school anymore?|`|3DRzoajaaa	They're bleached like my soul..
l9c2Uw5baa	A dessert place I know of would be Le Commensal, they are located close to Bay and Dundas <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.commensal.com/en/produits/restaurants/desserts_vegetariens/default.idigit" rel="nofollow">http://www.commensal.com/en/produits/res...</a><br>  <br>  Also, you could try The Hot House Cafe (on Church) and St. Lawrence Market used to have an awesome dessert place (on the lower level).<br>  <br>  I found this one on the net and it looks pretty good (located near Harbourfront):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.townandcountrybuffet.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.townandcountrybuffet.com/</a>|`|xYTagSIyaa	One of the best places I know for a terrific dessert buffet is the Mandarin Restaurant and there is lots of them all over Toronto.  I like buffets and have been to many different places but the Mandarin is the best.  It offers the biggest and tastiest variety and selection.  You just would not believe their desserts.  The whole dinner is about 21. dollars.<br>  You can go back as many times as you want and eat as much as you want.<br>  <br>  Connoisseur  Of Fine Buffets|`|oTIQMVioaa	Not sure about dessert buffets...but Amuse Bouche, one of the best French restaurants in the city, offers a dessert tasting menu.<br>  <br>  I believe it's $35 for a 7 course dessert, or $25 for a 5 course dessert tasting.
ejuJiZAAaa	idk
k8HpMaHxaa	Last time I was there is was $10/person. Its been a year or so...with the economy in the state it is, it may have gone up a bit. Love the food there, foods always fresh and staff is on top of things, even on busier nights. =]<br>  <br>  As bad as Main Street looks, the chinese place there is really good for take out also. Fast and cheap.|`|ejuJiZAAaa	20 to 40
