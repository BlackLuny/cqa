I don't really think its intently.But okay, like my hair this semester was platinum blonde on top, and light brown on bottom.Nobody else at school had that hair color, till then somebody got it.   And then I started wearing beads, you know like those small necklace beads that are commonly worn.Well they went out of fashion at school since last year, I started wearing them for like a week or so, then everybody else started again.      And now, I barley just got my hair done a dark auburn.Nobody else had it that color there, and now there's a girl with the same hair color, except for the highlights I had.      I mean I'm not trying to say I'm great or anything, but what is wrong with people?Why are they doing this?I don't think they look at it and say their gonna do the same thing (even though one girl said she was gonna do the same hair color as me), I just don't get it.

Ok, my hair really gets on my nerves. it's wavy and used to be in quite good condition and go into really nice curles. when i was about 13 i straightened it everyday for like a year and it ended up split, but not dry and still got nice curls (when i say curls it's more waves). the only thing is, whenever i dye my hair it instantly goes completely dry but i hate my natural hair colour! i left all the dye to grow out last year and you can literally see how it was dry where it was dyed and glossy where it wasn't. my hair is currently blonde and it's not split, just dry! if i don't wash my hair for a bit longer than usual it goes into really good condition on the ends and goes glossy again but the roots are greasy. i normally wash it every 2 to 3 days and use serum in it when it's wet to twist my curls into shape. sometimes it works but i always have these 2 sections of really dry horrible hair and the rest of my hair is ok. no idea what to do! help i just want glossy nice hair. any treatments or products that ACTUALLY work? or tips? thanks.

20090131175900AA7mfNo	Beauty & Style;Hair	How can i fix my hair?! this is terrible!?	So, a few months ago, i went to my stylist and she bleached my hair (from when i dyed it black) and dyed it similar to my natural color, but more reddish (my natural is a dark blonde).  I got tired of that color, so i went and bought a semi-permanent (Natural Instincts) hair dye (the color was a golden dark brown i believe). So i put the dye in, rinsed it out as per directions.  However when it dried,  my hair turned out REDISH PURPLE (yikes!) at the roots and blackish/redish/purple everywhere else. Is there a way to fix this without bleaching it?  I know color cannot lift color, but since it's a semiperm dye, is there anything else I can do?  Thanks!

A few days ago I got a hack job done on my hair at a low-end salon and after much arguing, they didn't want to fix it.  After that, I ended up walking to a busy high-end salon down the block and asked if I could make an appointment with them to cut my hair.  The master stylist overheard my story and offered to squeeze me in on her lunch break that same day and ended up charging me what the jr stylist would've charge. I was very ecstatic with the end result of my haircut but when it came time to paying the tip, I (embarrassingly and unintentionally) tipped her only $5!!!  I was so high on how my haircut turned out, I didn't realize it until that night! After years of habitually tipping $5 at low-end salons,  I can't believe I tipped that little on what should've been a $60 hair cut! I loved how she cut my hair and I want her to be my regular stylist from now on, but I think I may have insulted her. Any advice on how to fix this?

Well I am bulimic, I HAVE tried so hard to stop throwing up but I cant.  This year I am required to go on school camp. I usually do not eat during the day until dinner time, and if I do this on camp, my teachers will probably make me eat or want to 'talk' to me. I have teachers that do know about this, but not all of them do, and i am not sure If the ones who do know will be on this camp. Like what do I do? I have to eat, and I mostly likely will not be able to throw it up because people will know if i do. Only a few people know about this and I do not want others to know because I feel so ashamed. I HAVE to go on this camp because it is part of the curriculum. Please no lectures. What should I do at meal times? how will i stop myself from the urge to throw up everything?   I know that I SHOULD STOP, but right now for me i just cannot stop. My parents DO know, but they keep avoiding the situation, saying it is not serious. The school psychologist knows, but they did not do anything either. My teachers have been the most supportive, but i feel bad talking to them because they are busy people.    Thank You. Only about three friends at school know about this, but they think I don't do it anymore, because I feel bad talking it to them about it too. I just don't no what to do anymore

20090131183706AAfJ4wf	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	I'm either beautiful or unattractive, why?	Why is it that alot of people say I'm beautiful and some people say I'm not their type but I'm never "o.k."? At my school, there are several guys who ask me out and say I'm gorgeous but another group of guys that say I'm just not their type. Guys never say I'm "o.k." or "average". Why is that? I'm half Japanese, my other half is pretty much French, German, Dutch, American Indian and Jewish. Guys call my friends cute or pretty or average but I'm never inbetween. Either people really find me attractive or people think I'm pretty but they don't feel attracted towards me. Alot of people say I look like Catherine Zeta Jones with a smaller nose.        http://www.iefilmi.com/files/images/cath...       I'm afraid to post my real picture, just because I don't think the internet is that safe. :P So ultimately, my question is: Why are some girls very pretty in everyones' eyes but I'm either gorgeous or just not their taste? Some people say I look kind of exotic, is that why?

When i get pimples i usually wash my face and put some pimple cream on it. I did exactly the same thing when i went to bed yesterday. And this morning when i woke up, the pimple got bigger and now it is yellow!!      I don't pop/squeeze pimples because i believe that would leave some kind of scar or infection. The thought of popping my pimple just grosses me out. I have some free time so I figured I should try some of your suggestions. Usually when i put pimple cream, they go away in a few days but this pimple is different, it won't go away!      Now, i repeat, I DO NOT WANT TO POP IT! Please help, it's really huge

I would go out an do it on my own, I have before, shocker. But it's my ears and my gym teacher makes us take it out for gym, so i have to do it over summer. And I'd rather they said yes so I don't have to tell them where I go get this done, and who is with me... Wow this is long.    Any ideas on how to make them say yes.

I kept wiping them dry but every time I'd try to reapply my eyeliner it wouldn't go on.  I washed my eyes and started over but I still couldn't get it to go on in the outside corners of both eyes.  I pushed super hard with the pencil over and over and just about drove myself crazy.  I put a dab of foundation on the skin and that helped slightly.  Anyways, I went on to work and tried several times throughout the day to attempt getting the eyeliner to go on.  Now my skin is raw and red and stings like hell cause I wiped it dry so much and nearly scratched it off trying to get that darn eyeliner to stick.     What causes this problem?  Can anyone offer any tips??     Thanks.  =)

First of all, I'm only 21 yrs old and I know some of you will think why use this product which is for older people lol. I've been having some problems with my skin for 7 years now and I've tried to use almost everything in the drug stores. I have naturally brown skin, but I have an Uneven skin tone due to some acne scars and from sun damage. I was 14 yrs old and used to wear makeup without using a sunscreen, I didn't know then I was supposed to! And my pores under my eyebags are kinda big and my skin is just not as tight or firm like it used to. And I was just wondering, if I try this Olay Firming Cream, would it be very bad for my face because I'm only 21? and I know this isn't exactly for young people. But when I read what it does, it's got everything I need! Please don't tell me I need to see a dermatologist, I've been there a few times and she gave me Avar-e green cream, Tazorac, and Differin, NONE of them worked! So, it was a waste of time and lots of money. My skin type is normal, I'm using Aveeno moisturizer and the Ambi exfoliating wash, I love both of this products, I don't break out and Ambi doesn't make my face very dry. What would you all recommend? Sorry it's a long one and Thanks in advance

20090131200657AA7pFF7	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	How do I break the silence?	OK, I know this is definitely the wrong section but I tried the Family&Relationships sections and got barely any answers and I ALWAYS get answers here, so I'm trying this here. Thanks to honest answers!      OK, so my best guy friend of a year and half hasn't spoken to me in about two months now. Granted, it's sort of my fault but also his. We went to homecoming together and some drama started there and we weren't as close anymore. He began acting nice and then mean, and then nice and mean. I asked to talk to him to try to work out our friendship at school and he said "OK...we'll talk tomorrow" and then he blatantly ignored me and acted mean for a while until he realized I wasn't going to press the issue, and then started acting nice again, mean then nice on and off. I finally decided I couldn't take it anymore and I decided I wasn't going to make an effort to talk to him anymore - I wasn't going to ignore him if he talked to me, but I wasn't going to try to be around him anymore. Well, basically I guess he thought I was ignoring him and now we both ignore each other even though we see each other everyday. I'm starting to regret it and I wish I could talk to him again but then I think about how mean he has been to me in the past and have to rethink it. I have considered that maybe he's mad at me for something I did, but I'm not sure if it's that or if he simply doesn't care anymore (if your a guy, what do you think?) He's a senior and graduating this year - should I just wait out the rest of the year and forget about him or should I try to rebuild our friendship again? and how - if he's been ignoring me so long, how do I talk to him again without making him mad? Thank you!

20090131201701AAO1xNq	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Belly button piercing?	I had my belly button pierced on Jan. 28th.   This is my first body piercing.      I have noticed that every once in a while, my barbell gets "stuck" inside my new piercing. I think it's the skin or the scabbing from it healing getting stuck on the bar. I was told to move it so it does not get stuck. Is this a good tip?      Also, I have been using H 2 Oxygen to clean and sterilize the piercing.    I haven't noticed any pus or bleeding since I had it done, but it is still sore if it is messed with.      What are some good tips to help it heal better, faster and to releave the pain?   Thanks :]      Also:   I dont plan on taking it out to change it until after I have had it in for AT LEASE 8 weeks.   I also do use an anti-bacterial soap in the shower :]

20090131193805AA25iTq	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Why are some of you so mean to blonde people?	ok in this question:   (can't add, I will add to details)      Anybody who said they like number one better got at least 4 thumbs down. And I saw at least two people say they do not like blondes because they think they are dumb. If you like brunettes better, fine, but don't give other people thumbs down. I am sure there was many more dumb brunettes than  dumb blondes since there are more brunettes in the world than blondes. I am a natural blonde and think you should stop stereotyping      Do you agree with me? what is your opinon?

20090226080633AAIEjQ8	Beauty & Style;Hair	How long will it take to grow my hair, and will it ever be the same?	Okay well... Im 16. when I was younger, like 12 and younger, I had naturally blonde, wavy hair. I thought it was kinda ugly, because most girls around me had perfectly straight dark hair, and I had frizz because I didnt know to products in it. I just washed it, let it air dry and went. Then I got into a goth phase, I cut my hair short and dyed it black. I kept dying and dying it, and started straightening it everyday. A while ago I got sick of the goth phase and wanted to be a blonde. So I started the process of bleaching my hair.Today, my hair is a dirty blonde shade with highlights, and its like shoulder length with side bangs and layers. I straighten it everyday still because if I don't, it is really poofy, frizzy and curly, but its not a good curly, its curly in some spots and flat in other spots.        Anyway now Im sick of straightening my hair and I just want my hair to look good wavy again. Is it possible that ive ruined my hair for good with all the straightening and dying ?    I was hoping that when I grow my hair long (like almost bra strap length) it will weigh it down and be more wavy and less poofy. How long do you think it would take?      This is an example of how my hair used to be :       http://www.exposay.com/celebrity-photos/...

This is a weird question... an 'am I pretty' question of sorts... only that's not really what i'm looking to hear. What I want you to tell me is what you think of me from seeing my pictures? I mean, can you tell anything about me? If you saw me on the street or were introduced to me, the way we all sort of form opinions about people before we talk to them, what would you think?

20090131194858AAuqZRs	Beauty & Style;Hair	How would my hair look good?	I have hair that goes down to my shoulders and is curly. I always wear it in a pony tail because straightening takes too long and i hear it dries out your hair. I'm not planning on getting a new straightener(one that protects your hair) and the only way it looks good when its down is when its straightened. any suggestions on hair styles?
