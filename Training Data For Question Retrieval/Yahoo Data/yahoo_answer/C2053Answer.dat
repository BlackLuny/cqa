Add details!  You needn't write a book, but let us know EXACTLY what it is you're hoping to find out.  Include as much information as you can that is relevant to the question, problem, situation, etc.    Use decent grammar, punctuation, and spelling.  If your question is long, break it into paragraphs ... no one wants to read a mile-long run-on sentence without punctuation.    Make sure your question is posted in the correct category.  When you create your question, Y!A will suggest several possible categories to post your question, and you will also have the option to choose from "All Categories."  If you aren't sure where to post your question, it's usually best to use one of the suggested categories.|`|UE3smuAJaa	i agree with the guy that was a long answer, about the third one down or so...you have to get to your question and copy the URL, go to another question in the same catergory and in your answer, paste the URL...you can do this unlimited.    when you get the error 999 all you have to do is erase your url, post it, edit the posted answer, then put the URL on it. it works every time, they atleast look at it!!    hope i helped!!  speaking of the subject!  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...

Then just above your list of answers is a green My Questions tab. Click that and go to a question that has been up for a while (it might even be highlighted in orange--if so, click that one). If you see the blue bubble, click it under the answer you find to be the best. Then rate the answer 1-5 stars, leave a comment, then click OK. You get 3 points, the best answer gets 10.

You click the bubble beneath the answer you like best, and then it will take you to a page, where you need to rate the response, and then leave a message to the asker. Then, you scroll down a little and click SUBMIT. The answerer will receive ten points, and you will receive three.    To put your question to vote, you can either wait for the time to expire and then vote for the best answer, or you can go to the pencil beneath your question. If you click on the pencil, three or four tabs (depending on whether you extended the expiration date or not) will pop down, and one of them will read "PUT THIS QUESTION TO VOTE."

eWhqqJeQaa	Walmart will be lower on regular prices.  They are a very low "everyday low price" (EDLP) grocer.  The opposite of Walmart would be a "high/low" grocer like Kroger.  Regular shelf prices are higher but low weekly feature prices are designed to lure you in.  Historically Food Lion was an EDLP grocer (although never to the extent that Walmart is) but you'll notice that they also offer weekly features -- trying to have it both ways.  That doesn't work.  The bottom line is that weekly features are attractive but they are intended to mask higher retails throughout the store.  Walmart is lower.|`|f8d7918b4c166ee1c8334e1038182548aa	If you are talking about price per oz, then Walmart.  If you are price per piece, Food Lion might be cheaper since you can buy smaller packages of some items.|`|0jPu3KQPaa	i don't know what or where food lion is, but i would of course guess walmart, walmart is the greatest place ever!
b81H0vlYaa	You have to wait at least 4 hours before being able to chose the best answer.    I don't get emails on my answers, and my avatar doesn't show up even though I did everything the right way!  So, I suppose if you are waiting 4 hours and you still cannot select a best answer it could be a glitch.  I believe you can only make comments after a best answer is selected.    Also, if you want to extend your deadline of time you have to vote, after you post your question, go to edit, and then extend right after you post it.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	You have a limited TIME window to do that in. AFTER 4 - 5 hours, but BEFORE 4 days. Earlier, there is no button available; later, and the question has 'expired' and gone to voting. Be sure to review your questions during that time and you can choose the Best Answer.|`|t2M1kXY4aa	Are you waiting at least 4 hours after your question posts?

9VaWal2Daa	I hate to see really GOOD answers not rewarded.     It is so lame, when someone takes the time, to give a really EXCELLENT answer.........and then the person let's it go to voting, where some troll, with 5 accounts, votes his own answer of  "Haha 2 pts!"  best answer, with his 5 accounts.     In those cases, the person SHOULD lose 50 points for  failing to pick a best answer.|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	They should all check back and at least pick one.|`|e5BIYpIWaa	Yep, I really don't like it!|`|jSjb5DUeaa	no i don't really care. i mean, if it didn't do it for them then thats fine.|`|t2M1kXY4aa	Yep, it's my pet Y!A peeve.    I think choosing BA should be mandatory and that repeated failure to do so should result in warning, loss of points, and even suspension.|`|3cLWlMQxaa	Yes, because it can take a lot of time for the person to think up of that awnser, especially when the simplest awnser is chosen.|`|SZdT1r8saa	It actually surprises me... Don't they lose points by asking a question... and they can gain some back by picking a best answer and they don't.  Weirdness!|`|s4G6iCliaa	Yes!|`|RMdKNJWtaa	It's a yes or no question. If it's a simple question, like 'which dress should I wear tomorrow?', and they actually take the advice given, they should reward people for their help.    If it's a pretty hard question or a complex one, one answer may not be sufficient enough to reward just one person. What if you thought everyone had valid points. There's no shared award for that.|`|PG7WfGpHaa	Sometimes.  Others, I can get a sneaky satisfaction from voting in the most crass and ignorant reply as best answer, or simply vote for my own. (which may be the same thing).|`|AA11945637	yup

Answers)  -Mystery run away contacts. (Yahoo! Mail)  -Sign in seals don't reappear.  -Sometimes cannot login to Yahoo!.  -Yahoo! 360 is severely plagued by bugs.    I guess currently there is nothing we can do, we will just have to wait until Yahoo! starts to sort out the mountains of problems on many of their services.
C8DOT8Y7aa	How do I delete the drop-down list of my past searches?    You can clear your Google search history from the Google search box, the Google Toolbar, or your browser. We've included instructions for all three methods below.    CLEARING YOUR GOOGLE SEARCH BOX HISTORY    The search history that displays in the search box on the Google homepage is stored by your browser, not by Google. Instructions appear below for disabling this search history in common browsers. If your browser isn't listed, we suggest consulting its online support center.    Microsoft Internet Explorer  1. Go to the "Tools" menu.  2. Select "Internet Options" and the "Content" tab.  3. Within the "Personal information" area, select "AutoComplete."  4. Click on "Clear Forms." You can also un-check the "Forms" box in this window to keep this information from being stored in the future.  5. Click "OK" to exit.    Alternatively, you can delete individual entries from your search history by using the Down arrow key to highlight a previous search, then pressing the Delete key once.    MSN  If you're using the Microsoft Network (MSN), changes made in Internet Explorer (IE) will take effect in your MSN browser. After making changes in IE, you'll need to sign out of and back into MSN for the changes to take effect.    Mozilla Firefox  1. Go to the "Tools" menu.  2. Select "Options" > "Privacy" > "Saved Form Information."  3. Click "Clear" and un-check the box.  4. Click "OK" to exit.    Safari  1. Go to the "Safari" menu and select "Preferences."  2. From the menus that pop up, select "Autofill."  3. Go to "Other forms" line and select the "Edit" button.  4. From the list of sites for which AutoFill is currently being applied, select "Google.com" > "Remove" > "Done."    CLEARING YOUR GOOGLE TOOLBAR HISTORY    To clear your search history from the drop-down text box on the Google Toolbar:    1. Click on the Google logo on the Toolbar to access the drop-down menu.  2. Select the "Clear Search History" option.    If you'd like to completely disable your Toolbar's search history, please click the "Options" button on your Toolbar and un-check the box next to "Drop-down search history."    If you have Google Toolbar 4.0 installed, you can clear your Toolbar's search history by starting to enter a search term in your Toolbar's search box. When your drop-down search history appears, simply click the "Clear History" link.    Please note that this only clears the search history from the Google Toolbar, which is entirely separate from the search history stored by your browser.    If you've followed these steps and information still appears in your Toolbar search box as you type, please visit http://www.google.com/support/bin/answer... for additional assistance.

Prior to that the delete for questions is at the pencil icon under the question and delete for answers is under the answer.    ? ??l???q ?|`|s4G6iCliaa	I don't think you can|`|3cLWlMQxaa	Maybe it's your browser, usually there's a ''delete'' link near to where your question is.|`|hbcFq0U2aa	You can't .

You get like a lousy extra 20 "votes" a day.......big whoop.     Alot of work to get to level 7, just for a stinking extra 20 votes.     Level 5 is usually sufficient, even for hardcore fans of the site.|`|xXeLkkqqaa	Once you reach Level 5 you could answer as many questions and ask as many questions as you want, and comment as much as you want. You can't be unlimited voting. The most you could vote is when your Level Six, then you could vote 100 times a day.    The most stars you could give out is when you are Level 2, and you could only star 100 times a day.|`|niivsTVxaa	Once you reach level 5 (5,000-9,999 Points) You are seen as trustworthy by Yahoo! and as a reward for contributing lots to the site you are given the ability to Post an unlimited amount of Questions & Answers per day.    You can now also post an unlimited amount of 'Comments' on resolved questions, the amount of stars/ratings you can give is not altered, and you can still vote on 80 unresolved questions.    Once you reach level 5 you have pretty much been given full access to the site, the only difference between level 5 & 6 is that you can cast 100 votes per day. there is absolutely no difference between level 6 & 7, but it does feel great to reach the top.

13d2160bf5e2dee45e4dc8a05b79d27baa	it depends on your question.    a best answer should be straightforward, answer the question completely, give a brief explanation, maybe a bit of personal opinion, and be intelligible to the average person.      a wikipaste of long medical jargon or specific terminology doesnt help anybody.|`|AA11944347	someone who took the time and effort to not only answer your question, but someone who does it in a creative way....like making you laugh but still helping you fighure out what you need to know.........|`|AA11080623	The correct answer to your question and the one with the most and best details|`|AA10865094	Look for the answer that gives you exactly what you were looking for.

Hky3sGeZaa	I agree with you. If somebody wants to know how old they look they probably have a good reason for wanting to know. Tell them the truth.|`|0OZ7QZf2aa	They don't wanna hurt your feelings.|`|t2M1kXY4aa	I ALWAYS give an honest answer.      I just don't answer those types of questions because I don't consider them appropriate for this site.|`|xXeLkkqqaa	I think you are absolutely correct. I do not like the jokers or people who just make fun of other peoples looks. I agree with you 100% percent.|`|zWB3jHHPaa	see your so right. but when i'm honest, people report me to yahoo b/c even tho some people ask for the truth, they can't really handle it. which is so lame. cause dont ask me if your ugly, knowing you are and that i'll say yes AND THEN report me to yahoo cause i'm being a "meanie" waaaah lol|`|AZhh3af7aa	I think when someone asks how old they look, it's because they either a) want someone to assuage their fears that they indeed look old, or b) they want someone to reinforce their belief that they do not look old.    That is, of course, unless a teenager is asking the question. In this case they usually just want to know if they can pass as 21.    So the lies are for the benefit of the asking person due to the perceived reason for the question.
XElaAuHHaa	Of course, if you known someone for 5 years and their your friend - you go give her a birthday card!    But i guess there is some love interest on your part here?|`|KmTq1yYlaa	give it. just cuz you give someone a card doesnt mean that you wanna be her bf and then make love to her then marry her then have ten kids then do her more then die.|`|eOMlc2eAaa	yes|`|c4RT0sFOaa	yes...why shouldn't you ? :)|`|CdCaLxKxaa	You should talk to her and think it over.|`|MB9fMHcwaa	well, depends on the boyfriend!  but if you are friends with this girl!  yeah why not, he doesn't own her and depending on your intetions, and birthday card is always nice!|`|BljwgBNUaa	GO 4 IT BRO!  THE THOUGHT IS THE ONE THAT COUNTS!  IT'S NOT DISRESPECTFUL TO GIVE SOME ONE A HAPPY B-DAY CARD...SO I THINK HER BF WON'T MIND AT ALL...AND IF HE DOES.........WHO CARES!  JUST DON'T WRITE ANYTHING BAD IN IT, OR DON'T DISRESPECT HER IN ANY WAY! AND U'LL DO FINE.|`|YhataORuaa	yea you should he cant stop you from giving her anything. if he does then he is being controlling and i don't like controlling boys plus she has been your friend this long hell yea give it to her!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|zcXk7Cdbaa	Yeah totally unless you ask her out and you friends it's fine.|`|e9Mp8Zrraa	Of course you should!  First of all shes your friend and its JUST a BIRTHDAY CARD, not   a proposal, or like asking her to go out. Giving a card doesnt mean you love her. Anyways, do it! And i hope she likes it!  Hope that helps!|`|380FLuAuaa	As long as you make it clear that you are a friend and not trying to become her girlfriend I do not see anything wrong with it. I would just watch what you say. If you would not want her boyfriend reading it do not put it in the card.|`|GBSnBbWiaa	Here is an idea if you want ot give it give it but if you are not sure....     Then do it as a secret admire! she will have no clue!! And also give her things from you( secret admire) for her B-day, valentines, and all holidays!|`|XZTf8Eahaa	Yes you should.|`|c3Ep0Ky3aa	Yes, it's her birthday, so there really shouldn't be any problem.|`|bBHlGs5waa	Yes.|`|HZ7Dlz3kaa	yes but make sure it's appropriate, and maybe do it with her b/f there so he doesn't think you are trying to be sneaky|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	Just give it to her.|`|Cqe1uWtbaa	yes,|`|BF896wpwaa	if she is a friend then of course you should|`|pLt3DzOgaa	If your friends with the girl then theres absoluteley nothing wrong with giving her a birthday card. If you "know" her as in you sit behind her in class or something then it'll probably look a bit wierd and stalker-ish|`|t2M1kXY4aa	Sure ... as long as the card is appropriate for a FRIEND, rather than a romantic interest.    To be safe, I'd go with a funny card or one with a cartoon character.
t2M1kXY4aa	Pretty much everyone cares what others think.  That's normal.    As long as you don't value others' opinions of you more than you value your own, you don't have a problem.|`|xXeLkkqqaa	Its ok, i'm like that to.

Click "Compose," located towards the top of the page, to begin composing a new message.     In the To: field, specify the recipient's email address. To send your message to more than one person, add additional email addresses, separated by commas (e.g., johndoe@yahoo.com, janedoe@yahoo.com, etc.).Note that you must always specify at least one recipient in the To: field. If you do not, an error message will appear when you attempt to send the message.     To add an entry in the Cc: field, click the "Add CC" link above the To: field.Then in the Cc: field, enter the email addresses of those to whom you would like to send a "carbon copy(Cc)" of your message. All other recipients of that message will be able to see that the person you designated as a Cc: has received a copy of the message.     To add an entry in the Bcc: field, click the "Add BCC" link above the To: field. Then in the Bcc: field, enter the email addresses of those to whom you would like to send a "blind carbon copy(Bcc)" of your message.This is nearly identical to the Cc: feature, except that Bcc: recipients are invisible to the To: and Cc: recipients of the message as well as to each other.(For example, if you send a message to johndoe@yahoo.com with a Bcc: to janedoe@yahoo.com, then johndoe will see himself as the message's only recipient, while janedoe will see that you have also sent the message To: johndoe.)     In the Subject field, enter the subject of your message.     Use the large text box to enter the body of your message.     Spell-checking can be done on your outgoing mail by selecting "Spell Check" after your message has been composed. If you're using the Color & Graphics version of Compose, you will find the Spell Check button located in the toolbar at the top of the text field. Any words that may be misspelled will then be outlined on your screen. When you have finished checking your spelling, click the "Edit Your Message" button to return to the Compose Mail window.     To attach a file to your message, click the "Attach Files" link located underneath the subject box, and click "Browse" to select a file. When you've selected a file, click the "Attach Files" button to attach the selected files to your message. Repeat these steps to attach multiple files.   Once you have completed the above steps, click the "Send" button to send the message.     Please note: If you are in the middle of composing a message, it's important that you either send the message or click the "Save as a Draft" button before clicking any of the links on the left navigation bar or viewing another site.If you don't do this, your browser's "Back" button may not work to retrieve the text that you have typed.     Also, to help protect the privacy of your account, be sure to click the "Sign Out" link located at the top left hand side of the page.     If your looking for advanced sending features with your Yahoo! Mail account, check out Yahoo! Mail Plus.     The Yahoo!

You will see a toolbar there where you can choose things to dress up your message, click things and get to know it.

RvU3FvqBaa	SCAM!!!  Just delete and forget about it!|`|33407a237a1435da5eda357dacf3ed72aa	It's  a scam      FWD  the  message  to  Abuse@Yahoo.com|`|AA11519518	"YAHOO AWARDS", "Yahoo Inc Lottery", "Yahoo Lottery Inc", "Yahoo UK Annual Promo Draws", "Yahoo/MSNLottery Incoperation", "Yahoo/MSN Lottery Inc" are some of the names used by scammers in fake lottery scams. No such lottery actually exists. Neither Yahoo nor Microsoft nor any other Internet / software / computer / automobile company runs any kind of lottery that randomly selects email addresses and pays cash to the email owners. Any such notification is a fake lottery scam.    You didn't win anything, they are just trying to trick you into sending money to them.    Any winning notification that says you won money because your email address was selected at random is a scam. There aren't any lotteries worldwide that work this way. In fact the same email has been sent to tens of thousands of email addresses, not just yours. The criminals will try to steal money from anyone who replies.    Please break off all contact with these swindlers now, if you haven't already done so.    If you have any suspect email that you want to report  or have checked, you can copy and paste the entire message text into the "Scam-O-Matic" webform for an instant reply:  http://www.scamomatic.com    It should quickly confirm most fake lottery scam emails as fake.

Be aware that a lot of these types of postings are done by 'trolls', simply to upset the users on the site.    |`|fc5a2676d0a9ea687d91d44050637158aa	well i try to show them how stupid it is to get advice from people on here about killing themselves because people don't care and may encourage them to want to kill themselves..    but i mean im a smart alec so i say whatever comes to mind to make them realize that killing yourself is not worth it..|`|IxuMTGd4aa	Hi    You should "Report Abuse" and click "This question is Illegal" or you can check "This question violates Community Guidelines/Terms of Service". This is your choice, since the person's question violates BOTH choices.    It is illegal to threaten to hurt themselves (suicide) or hurt others (homicide, assault, harassment, others) and also, if you read the CG (Community Guild Lines) and Terms (Terms of Service) it states that you cannot threaten, harm, or hurt other users.    ~*EDIT*~    I don't think you CAN find them and alert someone. But, look at the bottom of the screen, and look where it says "This question about _____ was asked in ___" And wherever that "in" place is, you can print off the sheet or e-mail your local police station and they may be able to track them down. Your a very nice person!

It will take you to the link.    OR...    Just type in avatars.yahoo.com in the search bar at the top of your webpage.

You're done.    =)|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Your Avatar.    Your avatar can be a cartoon figure or a photo. The cartoon figure is also used in Yahoo Messenger and appears on some customized Yahoo pages. The photo only appears in Yahoo 360 and Yahoo Answers. If you do not have an avatar then a shadow of a male figure appears. It can't be changed to female.     1. If you want a cartoon figure then go to http://avatars.yahoo.com and create or modify one and then go to  3. If you create one of the wrong sex then it can be changed in "preferences".     2. If you would rather have a photo then you must upload it to Yahoo 360 from your computer.  If it is on the web then download it first. Create a Yahoo 360 account if you don't have one. You can get one at http://360.yahoo.com . Click on the "My Page" tab and then "Edit Personal Photos". You are allowed to upload up to four photos there from your computer. Mark the one you want to use as your avatar as primary.     3. Now for either a cartoon or a photo save everything and go back to Yahoo Answers. Click on your old avatar in Yahoo Answers which brings you to your profile. Now go to "Edit My Info". You can pick the cartoon or photo to use.  BE SURE TO PREVIEW AND SAVE (OK) THE PAGE AT THE BOTTOM. Shortcut: http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my_edit    ? ??l???q ?
JnLoHaoAaa	Yes. Just go to your profile, look at your answers and try to find the question. A good way to keep tabs on the question is to "star" it.

lNAJm0tBaa	The version 9 has many bugs, that's why I no longer use it. In fact I had to downgrade from it and it was painful but successful and I'm happy with version 8. I would rather use version 5 instead of that awful version 9.     In your case, I'm afraid there isn't an easy solution, hopefully Yahoo is aware of most of the problems affecting version 9 users.     A few things you can do: find the latest version, I believe it's 9.0.02128 and install it (if that's not what you're using already). If the problem persist you can try and drop a comment on the Yahoo messenger blog  this is a link to the latest post on that blog http://www.ymessengerblog.com/blog/2009/...    Or you might want to go the longer way and try and go back to version 8. Kind of hard, you might run into issues with that. If you're willing to take the risk use the old versions available on this site www.oldversion.com/Yahoo-Messenger.html  notice it's not my site so I give no guarantees.    good luck.
