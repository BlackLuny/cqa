rZYbriNHaa	Global warming is fake. It is part of natural cycles. Stop worrying about what the "scientists" are saying and just live your life.|`|6WcTEpbWaa	In my opinion, global warming does indeed exist.  While I will admit that the globe does go through cycles, there is evidence that this current trend is more dramatic than in past years.  I am currently taking environmental science, and this has become a major topic of conversation.  While there are times when the patterns may suggest otherwise (such as your 1930's case), the hard facts suggest otherwise.  Plus, you cannot look at your area only.  It's called global warming for a reason-- it's not simply a local issue.  Therefore, you need to find data from other areas.  Furthermore, you should also note that global warming isn't a brand new thing.  We have been emitting carbon dioxide for longer than that.  The Industrial Revolution in the late 1800's is where our problem truly began.  It's just been skyrocketing as of late.|`|fcb9c7d570ea4f9bf655c4348c507672aa	Yep, the 1930's were warmer as well as around 1100 to 1500. And yet, man survived. actually, we thrived during the warmer temps. It was during the cold periods that man suffered.|`|AA10050984	Excellent question.  In the late 1920s and 1930s, most of the US was undergoing a long, hot, dry period (or a drought).  So temperatures were hotter than normal.  That is one of the lesser known causes of the great depression.  Remember the dust bowl stories. Farms in some areas became unproductive, and people moved, only to more unemployment in the cities.  <br>  <br>  In  the 1970s, scientists and climatologists  were talking about global cooling, and prolonged winter.  This is the same group that's trying to convince us that the global warming theory is too dire an emergency to wait to find out if it's actually true.  <br>  <br>  10,000 years ago, most of north america was covered with a huge ice sheet (or a glacier), and was very cold.  <br>  <br>  Millions of years ago, much of the eastern US was a tropical swamp.    <br>  <br>  From these facts, it's easy to see that there is climate change that occurs.  There's no question about that.  and it has had an impact on the area where you live.  The second question you alluded to: is man causing an accelerated or artificial climate change?  Or is this normal variation in temperature and climate.   We don't know yet.  <br>  <br>  In addition, a few month ago, I read something about increasing temperatures on Mars.  Perhaps the climate changes that we hear about are caused by some factor other than man, like variations in the sun? <br>  <br>  Very good question.|`|IiPsUxM7aa	, The hard truth of the matter is , GLOBAL WARMING IS REAL , is man made ? NO , the reality is our beloved planet goes through cycles , consider this, you can take every factory , every auto, every train , truck, boat & ALL THE PEOPLE ON THE PLANET and fit them into the state of Florida.<br>      That every one and everything that is man made on this planet into 1 small state, now it might be sorta cramped , but the math works, one volcanic eruption troughs more garbage into the atmosphere than 20 industrial revolutions , AGAIN MATH AT WORK,<br>     We as a people are so insignificant to this globe that it's just another way to generate tax dollars are you scared ? you should be, because we are looking at a disaster of biblical proportions unlike anything we have ever seen in recorded history.<br>     Plain and simple know one can ever know when the global climate shift is going to happen , but it WILL be in our children’s or grand children’s time just based upon the history of our planet, and again the math works , and math is truth.|`|zince8g1aa	It depends on where you're at.  To do a full analysis on your location, you'd have to look at the average annual temperature over time (not just records).  With regards to global warming, climate has varied from region to region around the world, not always in lockstep with the global trend.  In the U.S., an area that makes up a small percentage of the Earth, the 1930's were anomalously warm compared with the rest of the Earth, and with much greater annual variance, although the 2000's are still the warmest decade.<br>  <br>  Global trend:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/Fig.A2.lrg.gif" rel="nofollow">http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs...</a><br>  <br>  U.S. trend:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/Fig.D.lrg.gif" rel="nofollow">http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs...</a><br>  <br>  This suggests that there is a strong regional factor that affected U.S. climate in the 1930's.  Considering the much higher global mean temperature today, if that regional factor takes hold again, the U.S. will see some extremely warm years.|`|fwnqB0dTaa	YES IT EXISTED.<br>  <br>  It started with the Industrial Revolution<br>  <br>  BUT<br>  <br>  It wasn't responsible for those temperatures, they were down to LOCALISED WEATHER.<br>  <br>  I regularly see deniers using the 30's as an argument that warming isn't happening, but they are taking them out of context.<br>  <br>  They may be the record highs IN ONE AREA, but even 1934 comes nowhere when it comes to GLOBAL temperatures.|`|53VgQm9Caa	The answers is that the place where you're "at" had some record breaking hot days in the 1930s. But that doesn't mean that the whole globe did. <br>  <br>  Weather varies from point to point around the planet.|`|fp9bOiVFaa	It's called GLOBAL warming. The point is that the global average temperatures are getting higher. Some places are getting colder, but overall the WHOLE WORLD is getting hotter. Just because one location is getting/was hotter or colder doesn't say anything about the big picture.|`|S2Wp2Vjsaa	1934<br>  April 14:<br>  The worst dust storm of the Dust Bowl grips the American Midwest in what later becomes known as "Black Sunday." The Dust Bowl is believed to have been caused by soil erosion brought about by poor farming techniques.|`|MJMsOFpiaa	haha, the earth always warms up and cools down. The earth doesn't listen to what the weatherman says lol, it does it's own thing and it's gonna keep doing it.|`|BMEHg4s0aa	they changed the name now it is climate change because there is no globle warming
fp9bOiVFaa	Yeah, unfortunately there is some downgrading in the quality of the plastic when it's recycled. That's why most recycled plastic ends up in things like water pipes and park benches where it doesn't matter so much and why recycled plastic isn't in as much demand as say, recycled aluminum. I think it's a big incentive to buy less plastic altogether.<br>  <br>  I'm surprised the difference was so huge between the bags though.|`|MBFeHS22aa	There are thousands of plastics. They are used for thousands of uses. Do you want to drink pop from plastic that was used of motor oil or acid or insecticide. The plastic used for say football helmets is so much different from that used for a pop bottle. Recycling plastics are a nightmare.|`|737e8ad896c16931d3da06dca8c8e2b4aa	In general it is easy and inexpensive to recycle plastic.  Your experience with the tote is strange and I wonder what was really being sold?<br>  <br>  To recycle plastic it is separated by type. PE. PP,PET and PETG are the most common packaging materials. <br>  <br>  Next comes the hardest part, which is removing all the labels and residues.  <br>  <br>  Once the plastic is clean you just grind it into little bits and melt it to form pellets that can be melted and formed into new stuff.   <br>  <br>  The amount of energy to do this is minimal. The plastic is not quite as strong, and cannot be made white or clear, but it is fine for many uses.<br>  <br>  These totes sound strange. Why would they have the rough texture, and the odor indicating a volatile outgassing?  Plastics used for packaging do not outgas.  Perhaps some new process that uses glue to bind dissimilar plastics? Best to leave those on the shelf.

Because of the economic down turn they have closed thousands of plants and the pollution in the air and water is getting better. In CA we have seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of garbage going to the dump, up to 80% less construction waste, 30% less household waste and the lowest volume in 30 years out of San Francisco. There are plenty of stories around about how the earth is already reacting to our reduced consumerism and reduced fuel usage. <br>  <br>  Most people who want to be in denial are usually too scared to face facts because they don't think their effort can do any thing or they are selfish and don't care about future generations. I have children and don't feel I have the right to make things worse for them.|`|AA10324001	It's impossible to save the planet on your own. However, if we collectively make repeated efforts to do a fair share not only in the thought of saving the planet,  but by not hoarding energy that we don't need...then we make a difference.  <br>  You can explain to him the differences in using and wasting energy and what it costs to have something, but it being gone before you have actually used it.  One example would me cooking a burger and then leaving it out and throwing it away.  What a waste of food,  time and the energy (yours and the electric or gas from the stove) to cook it. Maybe introducing the idea that extended non-use of his electronics makes their lifespan shorter will help.  Doing what you can with your things is the only option you have control over.  He probably won't feel a major concern for the environment or his pocket change until he has children to leave a planet to live on, or has to make ends meet with expensive utility bills.<br>  Good luck|`|YhtsG22oaa	From a purely economic standpoint, you could tell your flatmate that if everyone were to adopt his attitude, the cost of rent would go up (since the landlord would have to find a way to pay for all that electricity).<br>  <br>  From an eco standpoint, electricity isn't free. Does he care about the quality of the air he breathes? Does he want to create radioactive waste? Because the electricity powering his laptop, TV, Playstation etc. has to come form either a powerplant (coal, natural gas, etc.) which increases air pollution or some other type of facility, most likely nuclear (which creates deadly radioactive waste that will most likely stay hazardous until the end of our planet's lifetime).<br>  <br>  Fatalism is a cop out. We humans all created some major environmental problems together, mostly through ignorance and lack of interest - the same lack of interest your flatmate is exhibiting. If we all make a number of simple and easy choices - switching off our electronics when not in use, buying efficient appliances when possible, using rechargeable batteries so as not to pollute landfills, buying organic and natural products, etc. we can have a major impact together.<br>  <br>  Good luck convincing your flatmate!<br>  <br>  - Aaron Dalton, Editor, <a href="http://1GreenProduct.com" rel="nofollow">http://1GreenProduct.com</a>|`|1Wxuv1Zoaa	Frankly, I'm with your boyfriend on this.  But tell him this:  It may be too late to save the environment, but what you do will extend the period of time the environment is still livable to humans.  Ask him if he wants to die earlier or later.|`|fLW4JP9jaa	Everyone has already said what I have to say, but wanted to support you on this. Your landlord may very well increase your rent. We had a $300 electric bill in January because all we had was an inefficient electric heater to keep us warm during the freezing snow. If I were my landlord paying for the electricity, I'd either raise the rent, or require the tennants to pay for their own utilities.  Don't think they aren't considering it. It's difficult living with someone whose ethics aren't similar to your own. I recycle and my roomy throws it all away. It counters my efforts and makes me feel mocked as well, even though I know better. Good luck to you.

pnCOR1UVaa	Going green is easy, there are so many great resources about the subject. My personal favorite is "The Green Book" which has parts of its book online as well at www.readthegreenbook.com.<br>  <br>  As I have been striving to "Go Green" I realize it is like stepping back in time without getting rid of my modern conveniences. I'm doing many things I learned as a child, like line drying my clothes, sweeping instead of vacuuming, opening the windows in the morning to catch the cool breeze, only buying what I need instead of everything that looks cool, growing some of my own food, and canning what I can't eat now. <br>  <br>  To me "going Green" is a frame of mind. Do what fits your lifestyle and do the easy things first, it is a process and like dieting if you go to radical to soon, you are more likely to go back to bad habits. I also believe there are good, better, best choices in most things. If you aren't ready to start a home garden, then try finding a farmers market, until you locate one look for produce grown as close to home as possible and go organic when available. <br>  <br>  Many people think "going green" is expensive, I disagree. Some changes may take an initial investment, but they usually have a short payoff time. Things like weatherstiping and insulation cost, but the energy savings will add up quickly. You may need to purchase reusable bags, but most stores give you a 5 or 10 cent credit, so you are paid back within a few months. <br>  <br>  My top tips are make your home more energy efficient, that also means using natural light, cooling and heating. <br>  <br>  Reduce your packaging, if you eat more fresh food you will generally reduce packaging, it's the same thing they tell dieters, shop the perimiter, that is where all the meat, dairy and produce are located. Only buy what you will use, many Americans throw away a lot of unused food. Buy in bulk, that doesn't just mean large packages, but that area with the bins that you buy only what you plan on using. <br>  <br>  Replace disposable items with durable items, if you eat outside often and use disposable paper or plastic plates, it is a wise investment to purchase a set of reusable plastic plates. Replace disposable razors, diapers and cleaning products like swiffer. Avoid bottled water, get a home filter like Pur or Brita.<br>  <br>  Recycle, www.earth911.org will help you locate the nearest recycle center. I try to only purchase plastics that are #1 or #2, they are more easily recycled. I also buy recycled products when available, that includes paper towels, napkings, toilet paper, tissue, school/office supplies and clothing.<br>  <br>  Detox your cleaning, vinegar and baking soda clean almost anything, they can even losen a hair clog. Seventh Generation and Method are a couple mainstream brands that are very earth friendly. <br>  <br>  Just start small and build from there, don't get overwhelmed.|`|t1zlbOURaa	Turn off your computer and your tv.

027e4b603b33c0e5ccaa877273bf5a75aa	Oil is one of our 3 or 4 primary sources of energy.. oil, natural gas, coal and nuclear (there are others sources of energy such as wind, water, wave, hydroelectric (dams) etc but these 4 are our primary sources.)<br>  <br>  Alternate energy lessens demand for the 4 primary sources depending upon what use of energy you are replacing..<br>  <br>  So alternate fuels, such as bio-diesel and ethanol based fuels, lessen the demand for oil for transportation.    Electric cars will lessen the demand for oil but increase the demand for electricity.. so there may be more demand for electrical generation and power plants (i.e. coal or nuclear).<br>  <br>  Oil prices are highly dependent on demand.. a relatively small drop in oil demand can cause a a big drop in oil prices.. this is exactly what happened in the last year when the oil prices plunged from $150bbl to $40bbl now..  I think that oil demand dropped by roughly only 5% but the price dropped by over 60%...  <br>  <br>  <br>  BTW Oil and even natural gas are used at times, and in some places, for electricity generation but both are  much more expensive than coal..or nuclear power... Therefore, oil and natural gas generators are mostly used to "top off" electricity generation in peak demand situations rather than a "base load" -- or everyday common use.  this is because oil and natural gas generators are easy to turn off while coal and nuclear power plans are hard to turn on and off.. <br>  <br>  Oil and natural gas are also widely used for home heating and other non-transportation uses so better insulated homes and higher winter temperatures will also affect demand.|`|ybdNwzMBaa	In a word NO.In four years time oil prices will rise sharply, as no new oil fields are coming on stream or being found.|`|yYYY4F5Taa	When the demand is more, prices also go up because the intention of the seller is  profit only.In india, sunlight is plenty and so solar energy works out much much cheaper.When the demand for electricity and petrol decreases, naturally the price goes down.When the raw material is free, why go for expensive ones?|`|5tpV7Jdcaa	We are adicted to energy.

The power plant near my home burns bunker C oil.|`|arsAqGf7aa	Less demand for oil so the price goes down.|`|koIN3agbaa	Oil is not directly used to create electricity.<br>  <br>  Electricity is not the only form of energy generated using alternative energy sources. For instance, using corn or sugar cane to generate ethanol is using an alternative energy source to produce a transportation fuel. Another form is conversion of Waste Vegetable Oil (WVO), or oil that is used in fast food restaurants etc. to biodiesel, which is another transportation fuel.<br>  <br>  Another way that use of alternative energy lowers oil prices indirectly is that currently a lot of natural gas is being used to generate electricity, in particular during periods when there is high demand for electricity. Use of solar energy and wind energy are used to generate electricity alleviates requirements for natural gas to generate electricity. Therefore natural gas can be used as a transportation fuel, alleviating demand for oil as a transportation fuel and therefore lowering cost.|`|4U1wzfwbaa	You can convert your home from oil heat to electric heating.  If you are using solar panels or wind mills to generate electric, you will be saving money because sun and wind is a source of renewable energy.

yYYY4F5Taa	An individual can do a lot to protect the environment.In fact all efforts become sustainable if and only if they start from the individual.It is the indifference of the individual that spoils the ecology.I must keep my home clean;I must not throw the rubbish on the road or in the neighbour's compound; I must plant trees where ever possible .Smoking is bad and spoils the environment. There is so much each person can do.|`|5tpV7Jdcaa	There are many wanna be greens out there.  I am a TRUE green.  I have not met anyone here who is green.

It may not be much, but if everybody pitches in a little bit, good things could happen.
in936M0Faa	The screams are a Cougar/Mountain lion/Puma (same thing just depends on where you are from on the name)  They also claw trees to mark territory. They do not decapitate goats though They will carry a whole one off to eat it though. (my mother in law just lost a newborn calf to one a few months ago) <br>      It could be a chupacabra also if you believe in them|`|TUcvTLSraa	Well, if you believe in this sort of stuff, this sounds like a case of "skinwalkers," which is a native word, meaning "to transform into a polterguiest creature" and can cause great havoc on farm animals. They can decapitate animals, melt them into a pile of rotten flesh, and burn them severely.|`|095b56dd67e50291a0aa17a0024ded4eaa	Reading what you say it could be either a lone bear or a cougar. remember wildlife look for food when winter get to an end and bears like fresh meat and hot blooded mamal when coming out of hibernation. Do you have bears where you live?|`|2ca90a8d5fe8a851bf0b47613006e3ddaa	one thing i can tell you is from the way you describe it it gives me the chills :)|`|b130d64eacb57af7bbee0fda7b233748aa	you list several distinctive clues that indicate 2 different kinds of animals...<br>  ..the 'scratches' on the barn wall say to me it's a bear, marking teritory, and self assured about it's supremacy in his area.<br>  <br>  ..the goat skulls confuse me, there ought to have been hide attached to the skulls but you didnt mention that. A skull showing up cleaned of all soft tissue seys dog or coyote to me, but if it came with the hide stll attached, it syes bear, again.<br>     A cougar would have hidden or covered up the portion it couldnt eat or didnt eat... nor would bear OR cougar have collected there kills into one particular plce..[unless they had young]..thus the confusion.<br>  <br>  .. The "pile of animal flesh" also miss leads me... ether there is more to that than youve mentioned, or a human is involved... 'flesh' is consumed by preditors of the 4 legged sort, .. only man packs around meat as youve indicated here.<br>  <br>  .. The 'screaming' seys to me theres cougars or a cougar who's circuit has extended or whos youthfullness is establishing it's circuit, and you are within it's circuit parrimitor.  It 'screams' for the same reasons house cats do... hormonal influence.. mateing calls, challanges, or teritory deffence.  Clearly, a cougar shares a protion of a bears habbitat and you happen to set in an overlap of the two territoryal boundrys. <br>  <br>  .. As far as the  "witch people"  will go, for me anyway, reading sign of them from your discriptions of happenstance seys some one suffers from a vivid emagination.|`|5b2d17f08f5e1b6907c7931670957797aa	I can think of a few people from college years ago, but I would say Hogzilla.

It breaks the electrical connection between the mains and your appliance.|`|pnCOR1UVaa	If you have sockets with switches you are stopping the flow of electricity, so you are saving the same amount as unplugging them. In the US these are very uncommon.|`|5tpV7Jdcaa	This is a good start.  Turning off the electiricy panel is best.  I envison a world where homes use 20 amps and computers in public places..  These things use a lot of energy.<br>  <br>  Also,  wash your clothes every month instead of every week.<br>  <br>  If we all do our part we will have a better world!|`|b8e7225eb1b9214f4836b0310368ade6aa	No matter where you turn them off, you have broken the connection to the appliance , just in a different place.Think of a garden hose where you can shut off the nozzle at the end or the valve on the wall, either way you have stopped the flow of water in the hose. shutting them both off is like turning off your switch AND unplugging the appliance. It works but is not necessary.|`|mw7UGMGjaa	you would save more money and energy by unplugging them.  You are saving some money and energy by just turning them off.|`|p7BbBfkRaa	i agree with Stijn otherwise whats the point of the switch?
5tpV7Jdcaa	Jose Manuel Durao Barroso OKed the plan in 2008.  We are working with the plan to reign in 20 20 20 targets.  Energy producers will face a 10% fine and increments of 5-10-15% depending on their outputs.  <br>  <br>  With the CO2 caps in place we will go further to tax the usage for every individual.  Members will be required to carry the ISHGS in their vehicles.  <br>  <br>  Europe will be on a path to be cleaner than medeival times.
