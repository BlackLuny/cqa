PwHQSAxvaa	Snowfall in the UK is commonplace in winter, but only in small amounts, and very localised, usually only on high ground in the west, or on exposed lower ground in the east and south. The warm Gulf stream generally protects western Britain from severe snowfall. Scottish and Welsh highlands can get severe falls, indeed there are ski resorts in Scotland, though snow is not guaranteed.    The reason Britain seems to cope badly with heavy snow is being unprepared and unaccustomed to it. London may get a severe snowfall once every 20 years. There is a lack of equipment like snow-ploughs etc, because this is very expensive equipment which may be used less than one day a year in most areas, so it would be a wasted investment.    The snow in the UK is generally the wet, sugary type, rather than fine, dry dusty snow.    Mean temperatures in the UK don't drop below 0C too often, or by too much, but there is a wide range of extremes. It has in recent years plummeted as low as -25C, but again this is a once in a lifetime event here.|`|046668252b7d273d3a4a3a6908a8607daa	It's actually not that bad- about 15-18cm and certainly not the depth that you will see in Canada. The problem is just typical over-reaction, lack of preparation and laziness by many councils, especially in the South of England.    People are bleating that 'we're not used to this much snow' but so what? It had been predicted that snow was coming since last week so there was plenty of time to get prepared. But no, instead snow ploughs were left snug in their garages while schools shut and public transport ground to  halt. It's actually very embarrassing and pathetic, particularly to see the mess of London, which is a major world city. In the current economic climate, you'd think councils would keep on top of things to ensure the roads and pavements were clear enough for most to get to work (although there are quite a few lazy sods who look for any excuse to lounge at home). Only those in rural areas have the excuse of having these difficulties.|`|HtRLnntRaa	It's uncommon down south to have snow, you'd think that they'd be able to put up with a bit of snow.    We up north have carried on with our lives as normal, its just getting alot of press attention because its down south.|`|wNSI1wdCaa	It might not be much snow but its more than what we're used to so most people were not well prepared. But in Canada as you say, you're used to it.

jszyKCqFaa	Should they? Well from a journalistic perspective I believe they, any other News/public service network, and journalists should:      - take an official Hippocratic type Oath   - not be biased at all, in any way, because it directly contradicts providing a respectable, credible, and pure public service   - show or state verbatim where and how they retrieve their sources live on the air or on any public airwave or otherwise. And in the exact context in regards to any quote or any information retrieved/received to prevent any intentional, or unintentional misleading/ misrepresentation of any information.      Unfortunately, with lack of a Hippocratic Oath and with a specific law created by the lawyers for Fox News in 2004, that, possibly, can never happen. Or at least puts forth legality to insure that it can happen if one we're so willing.|`|ksOW8Y4Aaa	"News" produced by the mainstream media is a product tailored for a certain market. Marketing, pure and simple. All of the infotainment spewed by any of the mainstream media outlets is basically, well, garbage. Some designed to appeal to Democrats, some designed to appeal to Republicans.
avhgLEu8aa	Here's a useful website to let you know more about it.    http://www.registryofguitartutors.co.uk/...
Oq5a5hRhaa	They were somewhat similar. In my head, there is not a significant difference between 1995 and 2005, although some things have changed. The late nineties differed from the early nineties a lot, because of the introduction of computers, Internet, and CDs and DVDs.<br>  <br>  Computers and the Internet weren't popular until the late 90's, so people didn't use instant messaging, blogs, and social networking sites.<br>  <br>  Cell phones also weren't popular, so if there was an emergency, you would have to find a pay phone, or stop at a nearby house in order to make a phone call. And if you wanted to talk to your friends, you had to go home and call them at home to do so.<br>  <br>  Kids usually spent their time playing outside--video games weren't as popular. In, say, 1992, kids would have a Nintendo set, but they would spend less time on it than they did playing outside. And they didn't get a new one every time an updated model came out.<br>  <br>  Kids also didn't go to sports, music, art, and language lessons after school. An elementary student might spend one night a week going to Boy or Girl Scouts, or Saturday mornings playing a sport, but they didn't have tons of activities to go to after school. They went outside and climbed trees, built forts in the woods, and rode bicycles instead.<br>  <br>  No one ever bought a car based on it's gas mileage. No one worried about how much gas cost. In the early 90s, most cars didn't have air bags, and many backseats only had lap belts. Kids stopped using car seats when they were preschool age. When you had to pile an extra kid in the car, you stuck one on your lap, or let them ride in the back of the pickup truck.<br>  <br>  Televisions were small, and certainly not flat-panel. The television my parents had in the early 90's didn't even use a remote control, and had a converter box that allowed you to get cable up to channel 39 (there weren't any more channels than that). The screen was about 19".<br>  <br>  In the early 90's most people still used cassette tapes and videocassettes for music and movies. Some people still had and used a record player.<br>  <br>  In the mid to late 90's people started buying computers. A lot of people had a computer, but no Internet. Many computer programs came on stacks of floppy disks for installation. And the people who got the Internet early (late nineties), usually didn't run any anti-virus software.<br>  <br>  Schools had no air conditioning, and windows that actually opened (and were open in the spring and fall). We had swings and monkey bars, and all kinds of dangerous equipment on the playground. If a kid got hurt, they went to the school nurse, who gave them an ice pack. The schools didn't worry about lawsuits from kids falling off the monkey bars. Kids also had to walk to the bus stop--the buses didn't stop at every house. Also, the school shooting trend didn't start until the mid 90's, and security was lax. No one worried about kids killing other kids, or even about adults coming into the school and kidnapping children. And every child born before 1990 or so had the chickenpox.<br>  <br>  No one worried about countries outside the US. In between the fall of the Soviet Union (1991) and 9/11 (2001), we didn't really have much of a reason to think about the rest of the world. Our terrorists were also Americans, like Timothy McVeigh, and the Unabomber.<br>  <br>  Reality TV was not mainstream. MTV might show Road Rules or The Real World, but only teenagers ever watched it. Most people would watch family-oriented sitcoms, like Full House. Children usually watched cartoons.|`|un0C52G8aa	Since I was in my 30s through most of the decade, the 1990s didn't have as much an impact on me as the 1970s and 1980s did.|`|AA11089667	it was soooooooo aswsome i was a teenager then lol!! i can say i had lots of fun :D|`|5UJSX3vJaa	the answer to your ? is no <br>  no they were not|`|QczEdd5qaa	i was born on 1994 <br>  <br>  i don't remember much|`|vELJqdQAaa	im a 90's kid, was born in 1990.

xZwwb3kVaa	This woman makes me sick. She neglects her children while she dresses in the latest fashion, and expects the rest of the Country to feed her with the money.First of all take those children off her and put them somewhere were they can have a decent life. As for her get her stitched up, and throw  her to the dogs. She is a disgrace to the human race of Mothers.Stop all her money, and make her work for it like all of us have had to do for our familys .|`|cjlANTG6aa	She collects SSI disability (social security) for herself and 3 children.  Those checks are over $600 each.  They say her 8 babies will have disabilities so they will be eligible too.  If she is disabled enough to not be able to work, how could she carry 8 children in a pregnancy and chase after 6 children.  She's a big scammer|`|aJRP6WWYaa	She won't get enough tax dollars to buy a mansion.|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	At the rate she's going she may as well invest in a warehouse to house all those kids.<br>  <br>  I don't get it either.....<br>  People saying as long as she's not hurting the children, everyone should stay out of her business.<br>  <br>  What about the needs of the older kids?<br>  Won't 8 crying babies wanting to be fed or changed wake up the other kids and disturb their sleep?<br>  <br>  With all the cribs sitting side by side that home will look very much like an orphanage out of the Ukraine.<br>  Where the kids can't learn to bond with anyone because no one ever held them or coddled them, and they have severe emotional problems.<br>  <br>  That broad needs to think of the kids welfare, versus her publicity stunts and "celebrity" status.|`|a5c96f01ce98dccbbe83fee4b61edbd0aa	Well, we already have the government taking our tax dollars. I really think that this woman is only thinking about herself because she definately knew what she was doing by bringing more children into the household would mean more 'tax money' for her. Of all the money she had, she could have gotten a larger home for her first set of children to live in, but instead she was thinking about herself. I think it is the welfare system's fault for letting this happen. You would think that they would put the childrens wellbeing first to make sure they are in a home with lots of room and food. The welfare system didn't try to look for ways to help the mother get a bigger home for her children, but instead they gave her more aid. <br>  <br>  Just want to let you know that tax dollars are already going to people that are on welfare. <br>  <br>  I really think she made a huge mistake by bringing more children into this world without a father in their lives. She is stealing that from them. And that is so selfish to not think of the childrens wellbeing knowing that there will not be a father figure in the home, which could make things worse. Selfish, if you ask me.<br>  <br>  I also think that by her mistakes, she is paying the price. You also have to understand, there are many, many Americans who are on welfare, not just her. The many that don't want to work because they want to live off the government.<br>  <br>  All I have to say is that we all know that she has problems, but that doesn't mean that people have to ignore the children, especially when they are innocent and don't really know what the heck is going on. If people really have a heart, then they should donate clothing for the children, the children only. Things happen, but it should be up to the welfare department to decide what to do with the children. If it was up to me and I was in that situation, I would put them up for adoption, if I couldn't take care of them. Give them a better home with a mother and father. <br>  <br>  Remember, people do make mistakes, selfish ones....but lets not use this excuse not to help the children who really need help with clothing and food. This mother will pay big time, she is doing so right now.<br>  <br>  Anyway, these children should not even be living in that kind of living conditions. I am surprised that CPS hasn't gotten involved. <br>  <br>  People can judge her, but don't judge her children for her mistakes.|`|SmFcDx4waa	who's sticking up for her? I haven't heard anyone say anything good about her (and rightly so) I feel sorry for her kids, because its not their fault their mom is a nutcase|`|5frOVAgSaa	i didn't know that she was asking for help like this, but one can't be too sure about her looking for million dollar houses because the media can be deadly biased against a person in order to degrade their image.<br>  <br>  but i would have to say that every person has their right to have children, so yeah, on this aspect, leave her alone.

bHN8JCETaa	In New York, torture is an element for 1st degree murder.  This was definitely torture.  The threat of a 2nd degree murder charge will not deter anyone with these inclinations.  New York needs to amend their statutes.  Meanwhile, Mo should be charged with 1st degree murder.  The U.S. does not condone "honor killings" and this cover cannot possibly excuse or mitigate a crime of this nature, now or ever.|`|GDwMdfqjaa	Intentional beheading counts as a 2nd degree murder?! I don't even want to imagine what would be considered 1st degree in their eyes then. Obviously, beheading should not only be counted as 1st degree murder but some additional penalties should be added for such a gruesome way of execution.<br>  <br>  As for honor killing - It's very common in Muslim countries, and civilized countries with a relatively large Muslim minority[For example Israel with 16% Muslims] suffer from several cases of honor killings per year, so unfortunately, what we think is right, what America thinks is right - Doesn't mean squat. Better get used to it - Honor killing is part of the 'religion of peace'.
nhfaPN0Iaa	No, this is a very bad idea, rapprochement is in and Obama is talking<br>  to our enemies. So why should Pakistan not be able to negotiate with radicals and introduce sharia law in certain areas to minimize the fighting.<br>  The fact they, the Taliban, have broader goals does lend some weight to your proposal though.<br>  As many past invaders of Afghanistan have discovered it is impossible to defeat these guerilla fighters and America has a tough task ahead.|`|VfowGdWLaa	I hope not. I understand of the danger it poses for us, but what about the impact it might have on the US if they decide to use nukes. I agree that it is a real bad thing that the Pakistani government agrees to a ceasefire with the Taliban knowing that the Taliban is a terrorist organization and that there are Nuclear weapons in the country. I'm pretty sure that government thought that Through, so it doesn't look good for us.|`|mLdlFhyqaa	Bad idea dude.  The PRC is good friends with Pakistan.|`|RXvZvnJHaa	No.|`|UNw3L5qfaa	I think it is quite ironic that your screen name is "common sense".<br>  <br>  Let me first tell you that Pakistan's nuclear weapons program was allowed to develop, it was encouraged to develop and was then rewarded by none other than the US.<br>  <br>  The current military dictatorship which is no more than a puppet government to the US sits on the throne like kings doing nothing in the country, a nation drenched in mutual hate of its very own people, borders with India, and a nation who, as you have rightly stated harbors terrorist training camps.<br>  <br>  Now India and Pakistan went through a brief arms race much like the Russian fed. and US did, although pakistan and india ran out of funds pretty quickly, but never the less, Pakistan as a result has mountains of nuclear warheads.<br>  <br>  Now, going back to your point, you want, the US who is heavily swamped down in Afghanistan and Iraq, soon to be Iran with the aid of more Israeli propaganda, to launch a war against a nation with a massive nuclear deterrent, a nation who's nuclear deterrent like all nuclear deterrent means "mutually assured destruction", commonly abbreviated as MAD.<br>  <br>  Attacking Pakistan would see the end to the aggressor.<br>  <br>  I'd like to survive the next few years please.

The president, I believe wants us to get rid of them without harming the rest of the population.  Also the Taliban stirring up trouble in India too.  But they have the bomb, and as long as the good guys (whoever that may be?) have control, then we are safe to kick but in Afganistan.<br>  I would like to shout out loudly to California Senator Dianne Finestien, thanks for telling the world about our secret little drone base.|`|5frOVAgSaa	wtf has the US gained in afghanistan and iraq? they havn't achieved anything there so leave the Pakistan to the Pakistani troops. they are doing the best they can to handle the situation. an outright war can worsen things further in the region. but i bet since it wont effect your *** at your home, so it seems so easy for you that america should invade Pakistan. keep your lust for war and power to yourself, the world doesn't need it.<br>  <br>  i think the options of talk should be utilized first to see where it takes us... innocent lives are already being claimed with frequent drone attacks in Pakistan. the bloodshed has to be stopped one way or the other.<br>  <br>  and nuclear arsenal is the right for every nation. and they released the nuclear scientist AQ Khan because they found him innocent of the charges and that he was forced to give the statements since the previous government was under international pressure to make a case against the north koreans.

If we of all races "segregate on the weekends," we all do so by choice.  Forced desegregation is stupid on so many levels, it's not funny...  For evolutionary purposes, we need genetic variation, and if we all begin interbreeding, we will become a single race, equally vulnerable to disease and climate changes.  In terms of social and occupational competition, the pieces will fall into place without desegregation in the most orderly fashion possible; desegregation, on the other hand, forces people of different races into regions and occupations they may not be as good at (as individuals!) simply because of their ethnicity.  In Louisiana, it's extremely common for teachers and principals to be displaced or turned away from jobs simply because they are the wrong race in the wrong area; this is not due to racism, it's due to legal restrictions.  Once again, I will say, the government has no place whatsoever in dictating the functionality of systems designed to value qualification and nothing more.

There was ZERO reference to black people. It was very clear that it's a parody on the killing of the rampage chimp recently in the news (as the editor said). If anything, I inferred that the 800 pound gorilla (the stimulus bill) was already dead on the spot since more "stimulus" is already being requested.<br>  <br>  Sharpton's publicity stunt is going to backfire on him. It's just harder for him to get attention now that there's a black man in the white house. He's the only one inferring that this chimp is being likened to black people because that's what he wants to see--he is promoting the black victim mentality still (which is NOT the view of all black people).|`|503f82e81abb8901e8e1451d174089feaa	Well for once Sharpton is right,it was intended in bad taste and is racists.The next thing it did was belittle a woman who almost died from her own pet attacking her and now needs extensive surgery.I find nothing funny or comic about either.|`|AA11995175	al sharpton has his own agenda which is mostly green. the NY post knew damn well it would controversy. thats what they wanted.  i love monkeys and apes (chimpanzees are apes not monkeys). and i have never thought of black people that way, being synonymous with monkeys or apes. free speech is free speech, the day we say this and that is not acceptable is when we no longer have free speech.

wVsjgj35aa	Yes,of course,that has been the policy since Nov. 22,1963 and I see no indication that the policy of unqualified blind support for the Israeli government will cease at any point in the foreseeable future. Any administration that dared to depart from it would be driven from office by means of a rabid press campaign. The press will automatically turn against any president who fails to do as bidden by Tel Aviv; the press will  attack him like a pack of wild hyenas; the public will be influenced by this - to put it mildly - and he will not only become a one-term president but will receive little to no cooperation from Congress for the remainder of his single term. All presidents are aware of this. This happened to Gerald Ford,Jimmy Carter and George Bush Sr. They all had the audacity to differ with the G.O.I. on some point or other and promptly became the objects of vicious media hate campaigns.

I am now well, into adult hood.  I no longer have the same fears although I do believe that something huge and major will happen in my life time.  <br>  I cannot control the behavior of people in the world.  I cannot control meteors, nuclear strikes, or change the 2012 prophesy.  All I can do is live each day and strive to be the best person that I can be.  I try to be positive and make life a little more pleasant for other people.  Also, I am not a religion fanatic but I do have a strong faith and this helps me get through difficult times.  <br>  I am sorry that you are so worried about these tremendous things and I do understand.  I, like yourself, went through very difficult times of worry.  If your worrying is becomming an obession for you, you might wish to speak with a counselor either from a school that you might attend or from a mental health agency or clinic.  Just remember that you are not alone!  I would say that measured amounts of concern are appropriate, unhealthy levels of concern need to be addressed.  Best wishes
E047GSKdaa	The bias depends on the watcher.  You will find that most wealthy Americans with great insurance hate the movie.  Many poor Americans with no insurance, or those of us that pay 40% of our income for insurance like the movie.  <br>  The problem is American greed.  Yes, I would like to keep more money in my pocket too, but I would rather pay a bit more upfront than be bankrupted by medical expenses.  Some people have no problem walking on the backs of others to climb the income ladder.  The REALLY funny part is that most of those people call themselves Christians.  <br>  I guess it is about different ideals.  I put humanity before money.

7b90e0b137475b4929c9e437878b799baa	I've been wondering if the chickens have come home to roost.  In history God put up with people's immorality for a long time and then, they ran out of time.  "Be not deceived.  Whatsoever a man sows, that shall he also reap."  "God is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness,  He is not willing that any should perish, but that all come to repentance.  <br>  <br>  I think about His words,  "Be not afraid" daily.|`|dbd8bedc1820878658fc63ada79927e9aa	yes but not in the way i think you mean. i have a child in catholic school so i worry about her being able to continue on with her studies there with money becoming tighter every day.she wants to be there to get religious studies/go to chapel as her father and i don't go to church.so yes it's on my mind|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	I don't believe in god. <br>  Geologically speaking, there isn't a reason to.<br>  <br>  However, why don't you ask your pastor how the economy has effected the weekly donations.|`|503f82e81abb8901e8e1451d174089feaa	NO,but I am a tad behind in praying for the principalities and those in power because I have had to pray for any help.We are told to pray for them and now I understand why.|`|kJMzyFrsaa	No more or no less but I'm beginning to wonder what did Osama Bin Laden know about our big investiment banks and politicians and their insatiable greed that led to the collapse of the worlds economic system...<br>  <br>  His main attacks where against wall street and the war complex (pentagon)...|`|c88d6a4b2e8a26ac9bd239980605f6f8aa	No.|`|hbOFDysJaa	Yes.  It has me questioning a lot of things.|`|AA11452842	Not in the least. Makes me think about the mortgage brokers who sold loans to people who knew full well they could not afford them, all in the name of the almighty dollar. Makes me think about the banks and major corporations that gouge us for the most basic of services, who loose money for their misdeeds. Then they ask for us to bail them out.<br>  <br>  If there WAS a God, all of these thieving bastards would have been struck down already...............<br>  <br>  IF you can prove that to me.............you MAY have a convert. That stated, I'm pretty sure anything you show me will in fact be speculation. <br>  I do however, respect whatever it is you look to to get you through the day..........|`|FxAD44Moaa	nope,  made me reorganize my abilities and access  them accordingly.<br>  <br>  just in case.

As to your question of if it was a fitting tribute or not that all depends on how well it was done, and how well it mimics the originals.
QNObnVODaa	2 old chimney pots.  Just because something is old,doesn't mean it's valuable!   Unlike me of course - I'm priceless! haha.    Kev - You see through me as if I danced naked,with only a silken cloth covering my modesty!|`|iypgppEMaa	I wish i had one. The closest i came was my gran who had this rubbish old vase on her fireplace for ages as she didnt want to throw it away (the thing was horrible) then after my grandparents passed away we arranged for a guy t come look round the house and see if there was anything of value. He found a couple of ornaments and stuff and then spotted this vase. He said we should take it to a antiques dealer straight away, we did so and ended up putting it in an auction. It sold for 7000! Nice! unfortunately it was not ancient egyptian or anyhting like that.
i7oHTo9haa	Tlhere is no such thing as fair and balanced media, especially CNN.  Each news outlet puts their own view across.  The best bet is just look at variety of sources, AND study history as the news outlets only do current events, and not really what is behind the conflict.    History 101:  Never a distinct Palestinian people:  http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTI...    What Really Happened:  http://www.terrorismawareness.org/what-r...

You should re-fax it to them.|`|Q4IwLWLvaa	CNN would do just fine|`|FNcvcCsoaa	The irony of the so-called free country of the U.S.A. is that the pro-Jewish CNN is broadcasted in the Arab world while the balanced views of Al-Jazeera is banned in the U.S.    Read this one. It's much better.  http://english.aljazeera.net/|`|vFHXrOHNaa	CNN is an International News Agency and they now have their websites for diff rent countries and cultures.    CNN in India is called CNNIBN, then there is CNN Europe and CNN International.    BBC has the most sites in various languages.    This is just business to reach maximum audience, nothing wierd.
b299edc40bfec7da51e76575d6b08d9daa	very little the reason the news is frightening and depressing is because that's what people watch which increases ratings which sells more commercials which is how news programs get paid. every once in a while the government will politely request a story not get out if it involves national security or could help a criminal get away and the government has been known to release a fabricated story to catch a criminal or to protect national security but they don't abuse this because of the backlash if the press were to get pissed if you think about it it is in the governments best interest to keep everyone happy|`|cec4a3f7c2ce5d3dfbd588b08c6c0697aa	The government has very little control over what is covered by the news in the US.  Our first amendment rights guarantee us freedom of the press.  The government really only has any power when they refuse to release information.  The Freedom of Information Act was intended to create government discloser of federal documents however there are several exceptions that stop news organizations and private citizens from receiving requested documents.|`|RgO3Sn38aa	A LOT of it.  It's meant to weaken and scare the public.  This is done to gain submission of the people when the Government pulls a false flag (Google it) operation.  They scare you and then will claim to protect you.<br>  It's an easy way for them to order Marshal Law (Google it) and that usually means they can order you into camps for protection, take away your firearms, force vaccines, take away your food for distribution, and do who knows what to you.  Just remember what Hitler did once he unarmed the people.<br>  <br>  Did I scare you yet?|`|2ivrpXpeaa	Does it really matter? A friend of mine said once, "Believe nothing you see and only half of what you hear!|`|6gapssLfaa	All of it were just not allowed to know that. As in all other countries, weather it be communist, democratic, or whatever, just about whatever you see is governent regulated. <br>  <br>  It's kind of funny since just about everything is like that now.|`|zn0pXkc0aa	In the US the press is left to have free reign. Depending on state there are laws to protect reporters from divulging anonymous sources.<br>  <br>  There are sunshine laws guaranteeing access to public meetings where governmental officials will vote or make decisions. <br>  <br>  The kicker is advertisers have some "control" over newspaper content. At least in small towns where small newspapers are dependent on local ads.

You are on your own and you had better learn to protect yourself because nobody else is going to.  That's part of the reason we have the 2nd amendment.    <br>  <br>  Also, this is helpful.  <br>  <a href="http://immigrationcounters.com/" rel="nofollow">http://immigrationcounters.com/</a>

ebD1plKNaa	Just write a note that lets them know that you appreciate what they did.  If you saw or heard of some of the staff doing "special things" like getting him a glass of water, just saying hi with a friendly tone, comforting the family, etc. let them know that you appreciate those gestures.      Hospital staffs do get thank you notes from time to time and they are always cheered to receive even the simplest note.  Good luck, and I'm sorry for your loss.  May God bless you.|`|I1Hu4jmyaa	To all Doctors, nurses and staff of JFK hospital,       I wanted to take time to write this short note to you expressing me and my families sincere appreciation for the care and comfort given to my grandfather,Mr.------ -------.

2rdXW293aa	It sounds like you're considering this as a career move. It's hard to say whether it's better to be a celebrity publicist than one with a large company - it depends on what you're looking for.<br>  <br>  Yes, many publicists work in major metro areas and wherever there is a lot of business and industry, especially corporate headquarters.
cec4a3f7c2ce5d3dfbd588b08c6c0697aa	Before doing anything I would contact the pageant organizers and see if they can answer your questions.<br>  <br>  If you are supposed to submit the press release to a news outlet you want to get it to the assignment desk.  If I were you I would fax the release to them (fax numbers can typically be found on their websites) about a week before the event and then again the day of if the point is to get someone to come cover your event.  If not, like I said, I would ask for more specific information from the organizers.
zn0pXkc0aa	Tell whether you liked the movie or not.<br>  <br>  Then break down the parts of the movie that were good and not-so-good.<br>  <br>  Sum it up by stating why someone should watch or not watch the movie. <br>  <br>  That should give you the grafs you need.
kZ8jIStBaa	In 1975 the Vancouver based Greenpeace Foundation mounted an anti-whaling campaign which encountered Soviet whalers over the seamounts off Mendocino, California. This campaign had been influenced by the work of Paul Spong and Farley Mowat as well as Robert Hunter's encounter with the Orca Skana.<br>  <br>  In 1976 another anti-whaling expedition, using the James Bay as Greenpeace VII, disrupted the Soviet fleet again, but this time with the assistance of a "deep throat" source and extra funding from Ed Daly of World Airways. At about the same time visits to Japan were arranged to persuade the Japanese people that whaling should end.<br>  <br>  Greenpeace became involved with lobbying elected officials and various bodies such as the United Nations through events such as the Conference on the Human Environment and with the International Whaling Commission.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Peace#Campaigns" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Peace...</a>
AA10691226	Please be reasonable. The potus is not a terrorist; he has no friends in the Guantanamo prison. There's this little document called the US Constitution which says that Guantanamo is illegal for the US government to open, operate or maintain, so we definitely want this prison closed asap.    There are dangerous criminals in there, so we have to find new ways to bring them to justice and prevent them from harming us. There's more than one way to skin a cat, so there must be more ways than unlawful detainment using illegal, unethical methods such as torture to contain them. Important people have formed a committee to find legal ways to do this. You can send your comments and suggestions for legal ways to detain and interrogate people that can be effective and they will listen to you.    Otherwise, we give many more thousands of people who might otherwise not become terrorists reason to become terrorists against us.|`|tJeS4SZCaa	You are just angry because Barack Obama is dark skinned! and there are probably more Terrorists who are Americans, than there are, that are not. And the reason he shut down Prison is because 95% of people in there WEREN'T TERRORISTS!!!|`|YTasscmKaa	Its being closed because it is a stain on America's good name. The real criminals won't be released. They be tried and imprisoned in the US.|`|RgO3Sn38aa	Whew! I am so glad you are much more intelligent than the person who just asked this question on the link below.|`|oMF6bXCZaa	He is not just closing it for the sake of "closing it".  He agrees with millions of other Americans and those from around the world, who do not agree with horrendous torture techniques that they have been using in that facility.   He is not saying let them go, he is saying, we should find more humane ways to treat each other.      You my friend, have challenges of you own.  Hate begets hate!|`|509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	it is too costly to keep it open.  after so many years, I am not sure if the government can prove everyone in the prison is a terrorist or criminal.  but that doesn't mean all the prisoners are free.  some will still go to trials.|`|jr4aNLLlaa	Because he and his stupid liberal friends don't see terrorist as dangerous. He believes that you can put these people in a regular jail or prison. He's an idiot because he doesn't even know where he's going to put the terrorist after he closes guantanamo bay. Sorry to tell you this but it is going to happen he has signed the bill to close guantanamo bay|`|YJ0wCWk3aa	If you look into it, you'll find that a lot of the people being held there are actually not terrorists, and many of them are normal people from Afghanistan.  Seton Hall did a study which said that many of these people were captured by bounty hunters or something, that only were in it for the money, and were not actually captured by the US.  They also said that after some of the really unfair tribunals showed that some of the detainees were innocent, they redid those tribunals in order to keep them there.  McClatchy newspapers also did a series about Guantanamo Bay and found similar things.  There's even a memoir out there about someone who was innocent who was held there.  That's my biggest problem with Guantanamo Bay, the fact that there are so many injustices against innocent people.

b299edc40bfec7da51e76575d6b08d9daa	I live in Orlando FL and I don't watch the same news as people in Tampa about 70 miles away|`|Q2RWhAlVaa	usually about 100 miles from each city...depends what state your in as well|`|cec4a3f7c2ce5d3dfbd588b08c6c0697aa	As far as local television news the US is divided into about 200 television markets.  Some markets are bigger than others, for example Utah is the largest demographic in the country.  The stations in Salt Lake cover the entire state.  New Mexico is the second largest with viewers from Las Cruces, NM all the way to Durango, CO seeing the same on air product that comes from the stations in Albuquerque.  Some viewers like those in Waterloo, IA can see news from two markets.  Those viewers see the signal from the three major networks that are broadcast both out of Cedar Rapids and the Quad Cities.  That means you could receive NBC on Channel 3 from Cedar Rapids and on Channel 6 from the Quad Cities.  It would be the exact same programming except for the news which would differ because of local events.<br>  <br>  Stations across the country will typically have similar national news.  That means when President Obama signed the stimulus bill in Denver the other day not only did Denverites watch it but everyone from Augusta, Maine to San Jose, California probably saw some variation of the story.  The difference is local news in Denver focused on Obama's visit whereas stations in other areas on the country may not have devoted as much time to it.<br>  <br>  You should be able to see different stories from station to station within the same market.  While most stations cover the same big stories other content can vary greatly depending on their news philosophy or style.<br>  <br>  Basically, there is no set distance you have to travel to find different news.  It all depends on where you live.  Large populous states like California, Florida, and Texas have more markets than smaller states and therefore will have more variety.  Smaller states tend to have fewer stations meaning you'd have to go farther to find another option.  If you're dissatisfied with news on one channel however you shouldn't ever have to travel farther than your remote.
