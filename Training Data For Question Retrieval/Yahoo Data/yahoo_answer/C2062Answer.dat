2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Actually, they already DO have a rule that disallows multiple accounts. However, as you point out, it is basically unenforceable. However, what they rely on is that most people that violate the multiple user rule -- tend to violate a lot of other rules as well. Usually they use these accounts to pointgame or stalk -- and that is when they get caught and suspended.<br>  <br>  <EDIT: Yahoo Answers does not generally ban IPs exactly for the reason that you state -- it does not take into account people in the same household or institution. The closest they seem to have is the 'mult-suspended' flag. This seems to automatically suspend an account from the same IP address IF the account has already been suspended before and has made a NEW account too quickly. However, there must be instances where they DO block the IPs, because there are certain accounts that I KNOW are totally not allowed to make new YA accounts and there are spammers that never reappear. >|`|40EotGSlaa	Is that possible lol|`|ncCWnApDaa	I think multiple accounts like any violation yahoo relies on CM, so if they are notified of evidence which can be pretty blatant at times, for example there are accounts that do not answer only ask and award BA to the same person every time, then it almost certainly the same account and even if it isn't its definitely point gaming, so basically they disallow them by taking action against those that are reported to them.

zDQIPFH2aa	Chat is defined in the YA Community Guidelines (link at bottom of every page). There are specific things listed that you may not think are chat, but Yahoo defines it that way and you have to live with it. You should go to the site dizzay.com and see what a YA type site looks like when chat is allowed.<br>  <br>  Just stay away from questions that simply ask people's personal opinion or personal information. Those can sometimes be ok, but most of the time they are chat. Stick with questions that only ask for facts, figures, and data like a teacher might ask in school. You can ask for example Paris Hilton's age, but you can't ask what people thought of her dress. You can ask "What is a good SUV for a big family?", but not "What type of SUV do you drive?".<br>  <br>  Chatting is asking questions that can only be answered with personal opinion and to which only you and the answerer will give a hoot. You can tell most of these by the presence of pronouns (I,we,you,me,us) or pronoun adjectives (your,mine,ours). If these are present your question will be chat 90% of the time and if you can not rewrite the question without them, it is chat 99% of the time. <br>  <br>  People have different takes on violations, but I hope you will reread the community guidelines for other types of questions that are not allowed and specifically spelled out such as Fill in the Blank questions (link at the bottom of the page).<br>  <br>  The definition of spam or solicitation in YA is asking the users to do something other than just answer the question. There are some examples that most people think are innocent, but they are violations. Example include<br>  <br>  selling anything (even if free)<br>  buying anything (even if free)<br>  asking people to take polls outside of YA<br>  prayer requests of any kind or religion<br>  asking for or offering to make outfits or designs<br>  asking people to edit photos for you<br>  asking people for stars, votes, points, or anything of that sort<br>  asking people to answer a question and just giving them the link to a previous question<br>  asking people to e-mail you or IM you<br>  asking people to go to another website to do anything such as rate, vote,etc<br>  <br>  There are very rare exceptions, but just stay away from these. Some of these can also be considered other violation types such as "not a question".|`|8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	Spam is those who answer questions by Copy/Pasting a link to another website without giving any actual answer to the question. They use multiple accounts as the number of answers one can give in a day is limited. Systematically reporting those answers will render this technique ineffective. It also relates to those who advertise directly their stuff for sale as answers, even if it doesn't relate to the question. There's a shoe seller I've seen a few times doing that.<br>  Chatting is when the asker and one answerer keep editing their post to respond to each other, often disagreeing and insulting each other.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	spam is the answers that do not address the question but tell you to check out a certain website.  The same message will appear an answer for every question in that category.<br>  Chat are Q or A  that require no knowledge but are the equivalent of passing the time of day with a friend such as  Where do you live, how are you doing, am I pretty,   <br>  Any question that asks What do you think is chat

To check this, click on the icon of the person who has answered your question, his profile will be opened. If the person allows others to contact him, you'll see a "send XXX an email" enabled. If the person doesn't allow, either you won't see this link or this link will be disabled.

F0h2iFWsaa	level 3 is just like level 2, but with higher daily limits.    All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.  Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.    Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.    Hints:     answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)  you also get a point a day for signing in    each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly    :o)|`|hWc65sEtaa	Answer 60 questions  Vote 60 undecided questions  Ask 15 questions|`|AA11447210	It means you can answer more questions before you hit your limit for the day.

cCfUFAvzaa	I've been doing this a lot.     When you walk in, ask the person at the front desk. If it's a place like timmys, subway boston pizza etc the app's are at the front desk. And you ask the front person there for the application.    If you don't know if they're hiring, What I usually say is:   " Hi, I was wondering if you guys were hiring?"   If they say no, they'll usually say, "but you can have one anyway, and when we hire, we'll scan it along everyone elses."  But it's not a good idea to hand one in unless they ARE hiring, I find, because it lowers your chances of getting a job since it ends up close to the bottom of the pile.  But if the answer is yes, then just say " Okay can I get one please?"    Make sure you're polite.. you're trying to impress them. Especially if you get an interview!!     Also, some people directly ask for the manager to get an application, it's considered more respectful I guess and it shows confidence and might give you a better chance of getting hired if you make him/her like you. Sometimes you'll even get an interview on the spot- which has happend to me.. and it was freaking scary cause I wasn't ready. But it's also a good sign that he pays interest in you.    They look for people that will be on time and not miss a day. Kind of like, if you don't feel like geing to school, some people just...dont. You can't do that with a job. Unless your honestly sick.    Anyway, just remember to look happy and be polite. Maybe ask for the manager when getting an app because it'll make you look good. And if you get an interview, tell him your nervous cause it's your first job or something. But I heard some people like to train new workers to be how they want a worker of their's to be. Kind of so they wouldn't have any bad habbits.    Anyway I hope this helps =) Good luck ^^|`|V44ARW4maa	be friendly and ask the first person you see about an application and that person should send you in the right direction. Ask/say you want a job at that company/business. Bosses look for dependability when screening an applicant. I have found many to look at school attendance as a guide--more so than the grades of an applicant. Look at it from a boss's standpoint: they can train most people and they want someone who will show up (on time) everyday, even though they might not have great grades. Good luck.
AA11408911	Posting content along the lines of I don't know or where are you violates the community guidelines for chatting as you made no attempt to answer the question yet posted a comment simply for two points, as such these comments are often removed from the community.     Users on Yahoo! Answers are also requested to post content that can be understood by all members of the community and as such some users may also not appreciate the use of text language, however this is not specifically a violation of the community guidelines.     Lastly, suspensions on Yahoo! Answers are permanent, and an account shall remain suspended unless the owner of the account files a successful appeal to prove the suspension was unmerrited.     All the best  Chrs|`|hWc65sEtaa	Because they are not real answers.  They are considered chatting.  It goes against the guidelines.|`|lqbAA0Ytaa	It is considered, by Y!A rules, cheating/point-gaming. A violation.  http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...    If you get suspended, it is permanent. Unless you convince them they are in the wrong. Doubtful though.|`|dl1yuCoFaa	If you are answering questions with DK or WHY, they are non-answers, and are in violation of the Community Guidelines. If you can't give a valid answer to a question, or don't know the answer, skip the question. Answering with non answers such as "idk" or "DK" for the sole purpose of getting 2 points is considered point gaming.    "The following are some common ways people attempt to point-game or place-hold:        * Answering questions with only Thanks for the two points, Pick me as best, IDK (I dont know), Do a search, etc., without including a legitimate answer."    http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...

yJ3GpnXAaa	Have a look here  http://pages.ebay.co.uk/help/policies/qu...  for info on why listings can be ended by eBay for VeRO reasons.    If you really believe that your DVD is genuine, there's a link near the bottom of that info page to access the 'seller appeal webform'.    eBay is awash with fakes of all kinds and just because you bought the DVD from a seller there doesn't mean that it's automatically genuine - it could just have slipped through the net, although it could of course be genuine (hard to offer an opinion without even seeing the listing!)    More info on listing removal in general here  http://pages.ebay.co.uk/help/sell/questi...  and a couple more appeal links there, too.    It's not a good idea to relist until you have the go-ahead from eBay because they can suspend your account if you don't play by their rules.

AA10031957	Depending on the email service you are using there are several ways to do this. I will suggest a few    1. There will normally be a link at the bottom of the email which you can click to unsubscribe yourself, follow the steps on the screen after you click the link and unsubscribe  2. Mark the email as a spam mail and it will automatically be routed away from your inbox.  3. In extreme circumstances what I did in my hotmail account was that I put in a rule that if the person was not in my contacts list I do not want to receive emails from them, that helped keep my inbox clean

You only know it was received because you didn't get a delivery failure notice.|`|nkpRxWLgaa	If you mean, is someone else accessing your emails, they'll show they've been clicked on because they won't be in darker print.  If you mean whether the recipient has read it or just trashed it, there's no way to know.  All you can know is that it got through to their computer because you didn't get a failure to deliver notice...if they choose not to read it, that's their perogative and you have no way of knowing.|`|q8NCrzjnaa	Could you clarify the question please?<br>  <br>  Do you mean?<br>  <br>  A.

AMI8oQMDaa	Spam mail can contain viruses. However most do not. A spam mail is mainly a very large chain mail. When an identical e-mail is sent to 8 or more people at the same time the filtering system files at away as "Spam." If the sender decides to put a virus INTO the e-mail,(Which is not uncommon) then yes, it can bring you a virus. Basically, don't open the mail if it's coming from a source that you don't know.
2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	No, it is not. The Briefcase is a separate service. If you don't use it, you don't have to worry about it closing down. The email service is sticking around.<br>  <br>  Here is what Briefcase was:<br>  "Yahoo! Briefcase is a tool that allows you to store files online and then access them from anywhere. Think of it as an extra hard drive that you can use from any computer connected to the Internet. It's a tool for managing files from home, work, or any other location—and a great way to share files with family, friends, and co-workers. "

Just either try again or try a different way.
7u77AiBjaa	A link to your 360 space (with a public blog) would help in answering this question.    Likely you are having an issue with the "mature content" setting. That setting blocks blog entries from the public and 360 members under age 18. When someone excepts your Friends invite, they are no longer a "Public" viewer. If they are adults, then their "view mature content" setting is likely set to "Yes", thus allowing them to see those entries.    So, you have 3 choices likely:    1) Adjust "mature content" settings:   - You can access blog settings by clicking the "Settings" link at the top and clicking "Blog Settings" on the left OR while in "My Blog" clicking "Edit Blog Settings" in the top center of the 360 window. If you unset it for the entire blog now, you still have to go back to previous entries and un-check any that have the mature content setting.  - For individual entries, click the "Edit" link below an entry, click the "Show Options" link and check the mature content option, then re-save. (Although sometimes it's too late to un-check the option, which is a 360 glitch...you'll have to use  2 below to get "age 18 people with activated 360 spaces" to see those entries).    NOTE: If you do not follow the mature content guidelines, you are  violating the 360 community guidelines (see http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui... ) which could make your page open toward abuse reports, violation notices, and possible shutdown of the entire account. Mature guidelines are in place to protect visitors (friends or not) that are under the age of 18. This includes pictures.    2) Ask all site visitors (age 18 and over) with 360 pages to change their Basic Info Settings - click on the "Settings" link and scroll down to the bottom to select "Yes, let me view it" under "View Mature Content on a Blog." Click the "Save" button.

Then, delete the entries. Re-post the entries, but make sure that your mature content settings are off for the entire blog and for each entry.

The cartoon figure is also used in Yahoo Messenger and appears on some customized Yahoo pages. The photo only appears in Yahoo 360 and Yahoo Answers. If you do not have an avatar then a shadow of a male figure appears. It can't be changed to female.<br>  <br>  № 1. If you want a cartoon figure then go to <a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> and create or modify one and then go to № 3. If you create one of the wrong sex then it can be changed in "preferences".<br>  <br>  № 2. If you would rather have a photo then you must upload it to Yahoo 360 from your computer.  If it is on the web then download it first. Create a Yahoo 360 account if you don't have one. You can get one at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click on the "My Page" tab and then "Edit Personal Photos". You are allowed to upload up to four photos there from your computer. Mark the one you want to use as your avatar as primary.<br>  <br>  № 3. Now for either a cartoon or a photo save everything and go back to Yahoo Answers. Click on your old avatar in Yahoo Answers which brings you to your profile. Now go to "Edit My Info". You can pick the cartoon or photo to use.  BE SURE TO PREVIEW AND SAVE (OK) THE PAGE AT THE BOTTOM.

7fvzJIqvaa	Moving Pictures: Moving photos in folders and albumsPrint   The easiest way to move or rearrange photos in Picasa is to drag and drop them at their desired location. Before you get started, it's important to understand the implications of the move: Moving a photo to a different folder in Picasa also moves the photo on your hard drive. Moving a photo to an album, on the other hand, has no impact on the photo's actual file location on your hard drive.    Follow these steps:    Select the photos you'd like to move. You can only drag and drop photos from one folder or album at a time.   Click on a selected photo and hold the mouse key down while you drag your photos to their new location. Once your cursor is at the desired location, release the mouse key to drop them in the new folder or album.   If you have a large collection of photos, it may be easier to drag them to the folder list on the left-hand side of your library and drop them once the desired folder or album is highlighted.    You can also learn how to easily move photos to a new folder or combine photos from multiple folders into a new album.|`|AA12344929	dl the picasa software and in that u vill find the upload option then u upload the pics..at right up side u vill fine sign in button signin with u r gamil acc id and then upload u r pics........thats  u hav dought catch me with this id..

Ectn7tkSaa	If you want to email someone often you can add them in your email account.  Do what the person above described and ask the other person for their email address or give them yours.  If they give you theirs first start a new email message, use their email address and once sent you will get an message asking you if you want to add them as a contact.  Click okay and there you go.  If they add you first, when you reply to their email you will get the same message so click ok.  Easy!  Emailing on YA is not as good as you have a limited amount of emails per day, limited amount of space to write and the info doesn't get saved anywhere once you reply.  With your email account you can email as many times as you like, write as much as you like and they also get stored in your sent folder.  Also, when you receive an email you can just hit reply and keep going back and forth so you can always scroll down and see what was said.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Emailing on Yahoo Answers is done differently than on other sites. You have to click the avatar or name of the person, then see if they have an email link available (like I do). You can only email to one person at a time. The emails are routed THROUGH Yahoo Answers, without revealing your mail or mine (if you email me). The return emails also come through Yahoo Answers and say: You have receive a messge from another user. When you OPEN that email, it has the message in it.

I use to work for the AAA Bureau of investigations and I can tell you live agency will do a much more in depth look.|`|e9mUH1i8aa	try http://www.getabackgroundcheck.com/produ...|`|7898bed61433434531784bc3ff2ec3e9aa	Go to people search on line and enter person's info and it will give you opportunity to do check.

Questions that are resolved (which means Best Answer has already been selected) and those in voting questions can not be deleted.    However, if you want to delete open questions (if you have any or if you are going to have any), first of all you need to know where to find your questions.    1. Click on your avatar or name or photo frame (then you'll be going to your profile page).    2. In the middle down of page, you'll see there are 4 tabs there. Such as "My Answers", "My Questions, "My Starring Questions" and "My Watchlist". Click the tab "My Questions".    3. Click on the question(s) you want to delete (then you'll be going to your own question).    4. Click the button "Edit" which is under the information of your question, and then click "Delete Question".    5. You're finish deleting your question.    Hope this helps.|`|F0h2iFWsaa	Nope.    You can only delete questions that you asked, and you can only do that while they are still 'open'. Once a question is in 'voting' or has been resolved via a Best Answer being chosen, the question belongs to Y!A and is in their database forever (or until they start archiving old Q&As anyway).    To delete your question while it's still open, go to the question page, pass your mouse over the pencil icon in the toolbar below your question, and click Delete Question.    :o)    http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...|`|hZiwiboRaa	Don't think so : (|`|5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	You can only delete open question or answers, if they have gone to the vote or resolved they cannot be removed.

2QuW98BXaa	there have been Y!A meet ups in the past, but I haven't heard of anything recently.
C8DOT8Y7aa	No sorry.
AA11307940	It's fake, it's a scam, a phishing expedition to get your info. Yahoo would never ask us for our personal info in a email. They already have it. Look and see if it has the purple Yahoo logo and an exclamation mark after Yahoo!  Don't respond, just mark it spam.

If you had a prior Yahoo Answers account that posted material that violated the rules, it can cause both the YA account AND the email account with it to be suspended.<br>  <br>  The only way to get the accounts back is to win an appeal -- and that very rarely happens with full-account suspension.<br>  <br>  Appeal violations/suspensions using link in email, or this form:<br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers/first_appeal.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...</a>
