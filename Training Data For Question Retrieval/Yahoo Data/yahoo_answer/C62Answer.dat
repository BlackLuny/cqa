You are never upset for the reason you think. You only see in another what is also in yourself good or evil. When you think of something evil you absolutely do not have to carry it out.

It's only two months - and then he'll have a better understanding of what we do.  We ran into problems with Prior Service folks bringing their prior baggage from their former service to teh Coast Guard - and better than 2/3 of them were being kicked out because they couldn't adapt.  Those that went through Boot Camp did just fine.<br>  <br>  He'll be better off in the long run.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	The Coast Guard doesn't have prior service rules set in concrete.<br>  <br>  They look at each case individually.<br>  <br>  Yes, the Coast guard also looks at each case individually, to determine if you have to go thru thier basic again.<br>  <br>  Evidently they determined that he wasn't in the service long enough, to only go to the 4 week short Basic all prior service have to go to in the Coast Guard.|`|K8qAniReaa	Yes. If he is prior service he would have to do BCT.  That is not terribly uncommon.  If he spent more than five years out of the Army he would have to do BCT if he chose to go back.  If he joined the Marine Corps the day after leaving the Army he'd still have to go through BCT.  It's not that big a deal.  Coast Guard training has a rep for being easier than Army training so he'll be able to get through it in a few weeks.

But then allow the same rights that married people have, so that there isn't any difference between the two, except what it is called.  <br>  <br>  My reasons for saying this are the following:  <br>  <br>  Gay people already can marry some one of the opposite sex just as we can.  Weather they want to do that is up to them.  But they do have the same choice that every one else does, to marry some one of the opposite sex.   So then they all ready have the same rights that we do.  <br>  <br>  So they are in fact asking for some thing extra,  above and beyond what every one else already has.  Then that should be called a Civil Union, but again make it so that they will have all the same rights as a marred couple would have.  <br>  <br>  I think that if it were called a Civil Union and it were Not conducted  in a church, people would not have a problem with it or be so up set with it.  Allow for all the same rights as a marriage has.  Then there will be all of the same rights, including getting a divorce and spitting your property in two or more!<br>  <br>  BTW:  We are all entitled to feel the way that we feel and see it the way that we see it.

So, yes, it should be each person's individual right to decide who they enter into a lifelong union with, but I personally feel that it is wrong.|`|gF8gTZJxaa	If homosexuals wish play at being "married" they should have their own way of organising it not want the church to justify it. .

It would have gone a long way to solve the problem.<br>  <br>  But bad character will out. He and Cheney were so greedy for Texas and Wyoming that they decided to put the oil price through the roof.<br>  <br>  First, they manipulated the strategic petroleum reserve. Congress had to close that down. They were using it as a price support for Arabian oil.<br>  <br>  Second, they refused to police the Iraqi oil fields, so they never recovered production.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, they kept in place Bush I's ban on the drilling offshore. This was an executive order in addition to the legislative ban.<br>  <br>  Fourthly, they decided that when McCain/Palin was about to win, that they would kill Lehman Brothers to throw Obama the election, because he is against offshore oil drilling. Bush went on television 3 times before the election to tank the economy. He could have waited until after the election and he could have bailed Lehman out. He bailed everyone else out. Lehman had money market funds like bank accounts and this is what killed intermediation by non-banks.<br>  <br>  The sum of all these is that Bush is not only a crook, but the higher oil prices amounted to the straw that broke the camel's back - in this case, people's budgets. People could not afford their mortgages. In prolonging the Iraq War, he is probably capable of being prosecuted for war crimes. I think that he should be as an example of what happens when you put country last.<br>  <br>  But I agree that he did not create the situation, but he tried to take advantage of it and tanked the economy, the GOP, the country and McCain/Palin.

XLSfTnISaa	Don't listen to these people on here claiming that we officers don't show up for court. We always show up, and its a myth that we don't.

So pick the oddest time available. If there's night court, pick that. <br>  <br>  You will have to defend yourself. The commissioner (not a full judge, usually) will make a ruling after hearing both sides's stories. In general, if the two stories conflict, the winner will be the citing officer as it is their duty to tell the truth. <br>  <br>  ---<br>  Kasey C, PC guru since Apple II days<br>  Error, no keyboard - press F1 to continue.|`|NBXY35zPaa	Usually it's $10-15 per every mile over the speed limit. So it can range from $110-$165... But it depends where you're from. If he's telling you "it'll be dropped if you go to court" it either means he will not show up, or he's tricking you to do it and you'll have to pay it regardless. But most cops won't show up to court if they don't remember you or because they don't want to deal with court on their day off. If he's a younger cop, chances are he'll be there... If he's older, he probably won't. It's a gamble, but it doesn't hurt to go and take a shot. One trick that helps is calling/showing up to the courthouse before your court date and extending it to another time, it helps throw off the cop, and eventually he'll forget. Good luck.|`|vZ4NXlBmaa	Another person trying to avoid taking responsibility for their actions.....glad to see it<br>  <br>  you deserve the ticket...you should pay the ticket (like an adult) and you should stop trying to "defend yourself" when you're admitting guilt<br>  <br>  Odds are that officer will be in court and you'll get stuck with court costs as well. <br>  If not, he can always reschedule, and you'll get to go another day.|`|GdnQ81bbaa	Your best bet is to contact the courts and ask them these questions. They are the ones who will process your ticket and will know all the laws and regulation. You should also ask the courts if you are allowed to take a driving school class. This will prevent your insurance from going up and points from being placed on your license. Just make sure you get the courts permission before doing so. If you don’t the courts will reject your driving school certificate. Good luck!|`|AA11203798	smile nicely at the judge and who knows, you might get off.|`|bnJPvsVWaa	When you go to Court, get there early and get in the "need to see the Prosecutor" line, if there is one.  If not, seek out the Prosecutor, while they wander the courtroom.  In most NJ Municipal Courts, they will be holding multiple discussions about this very thing.   Inform them of the officer's statement, and they will guide you the rest of the way.  <br>  <br>  It's pretty uncommon to hear them say they will "drop everything."  Usually, they will be glad to downgrade to a lesser, or even a non-point, violation, so don't be surprised if the Prosecutor seems disinclined to dismiss completely, but tell them the story and the Officer's statement and they will usually do what they can, as long as there weren't other violations (DWI, unlicensed, uninsured, etc.) or any conduct issues, such as not complying with the officer's instructions.  Based on the officer's statement, though, that doesn't seem to be the case with you.   <br>  <br>  If you see the officer in court, you might approach them first and have them talk to the Prosecutor with you.  The Prosecutor, in most cases, will ask the officer for their opinion, before allowing any downgrade.  If the officer refuses, or isn't there, they may likely hold it for trial.  You might ask for dismissal in the officer's absence, but each Municipal Court Judge handles such things differently.  I've seen some dismiss and others flatly refuse, postponing for the officer to appear later.<br>  <br>  The conversation, once your name is called, will likely go something like.  Prosecutor :  Your honor, I've spoken with the officer in the case, and the State would be amenable to a downgrade to (whatever) or dismissal, due to (whatever).  You will probably be asked simple yes or no questions, like "do you agree?" and then the Judge will very commonly go along with the Prosecutor's motion.<br>  <br>  Three things you will want to keep in mind.   <br>  <br>  1.  A happy Judge is a cooperative Judge.  Dress appropriately, speak respectfully, and make sure you turn off any cell phones, pagers, etc.  <br>  <br>  2.  Nothing is guaranteed, for downgrades or dismissals, but NJ Municipal Courts tend to look like they're shuffling cattle.  The quicker they can resolve a case and kick it out the door, the better.  Remember that each Court has its own personality, though.<br>  <br>  3. Don't plead guilty or pay the ticket, until/unless you're sure you're not going to get a downgrade.  Non-point violations can be expensive, but the points really get your purse in the long run.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend going to the Court on the next available traffic date, and just watching how things proceed for a bit.  It might take you a half hour to see how that particular Court, and that particular Judge operates.  You'll see the Prosecutor, and you'll be able to watch how they operate, how approachable they are, etc.  Once you know what to expect, you'll be that much more at-ease on your own Court date.<br>  <br>  Here's a link to the fine schedules...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/mcs/October%20Min-Man%20Payable.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/mcs/Oct...</a>|`|lcNQ2w57aa	Kudos to Copgirl for her excellent answer, one of the few real cops answering stuff here.<br>  <br>  I have no idea why the cop would tell you that, if you really look like you do in that picture, maybe he was hitting on you.

AA11690451	I am SO sorry that you and your children are going through this. Yes, absolutely what you are experiencing is domestic abuse. The best thing for you to do is to get yourself and your children as far away from that man as you can. <br>  <br>  A good first step is to call a women's shelter or the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233)<br>  1-800-787-3224 (TTY for hearing impaired) - they will give you counseling and resources to help you decide you next best step.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about hell -sounds to me like you're already in it -what you need to worry about is getting yourself and your children safe. Please trust your gut instinct: this man is violent and could seriously hurt or kill you or your children. <br>  <br>  You may not be able to press charges or deal with him legally, but that's secondary to the issue at hand - just get out!|`|9533fb9762ea928a05c72b30daee8021aa	Find a battered women's shelter and run. . . fast.

They see and hear whats going on!!|`|1dc037c586cb3d99f6180676b1720822aa	Let me echo what everyone else has already said, many more eloquently than I can:  YES, what this person is doing to you is classic domestic violence.  I should point out that the violence is only the most obvious part of the cycle of abuse and control he is putting you through...by contantly putting you down, making you feel guilty, isolating you from friends and family, making threats about taking your children if you should try to leave him, damaging property, "front stage/back stage" personality (making himself look good to outsiders), all all classic symptoms of domestic violence.<br>  <br>  The one thing you do not mention is how long it has been since he has struck you.  Most states have statutes of limitation, which permits law enforcement to bring a criminal case for domestic assaults within a certain number of years.  If the violence against you is recent, calling the police and reporting the assaults could assist you in getting away from him.  I would recommend looking in your phone book for the number of the closest domestic violence shelter (or calling the national hotline) and speaking with an advocate as soon as possible.  They can assist you with getting a restraining order, making the decision to call the police, even arranging for temporary safe shelter while you attempt to leaver your abuser.<br>  <br>  Please do not delay.  You and your children deserve to live a in a violence-free home.  Your children learn from the examples they see; chlidren raised viewing domestic violence are much more likely to fall into the same patterns in their own relationships later in life.  <br>  <br>  If you do decide to call the police, let me give you some encouraging news: domestic violence cases are not hard to prove.  So long as you are willing to stand up in court and tell the jury what he did to you, the fact that there are no pictures of the injuries means very little.  The biggest problem with criminal cases of domestic violence is when the victim changes her story and denies the abuse.  Even then, many domestic batterers all over the country are still held responsible for their violence.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I hope you and your chldren get safe soon.|`|498fb2049e392d332c59c4471ee45489aa	Hello there, yes any form of making you feel guilty, pushing you, hitting you, calling you names, spitting in your face, taking the money away from you to spend or not letting you have any, not letting you go out, go out with friends, not letting you use the phone etc.. are all forms of domestic abuse, as I have been charged with domestic abuse before and had to take classes for 26 weeks, 1 day a week for 2 hours each time.

JTu1cLkYaa	McCain learned his lesson well from the 2000 elections. Smear, smear, smear and keep all the innuendos and attacks coming fast and strong. And don't worry about the damage they do, who cares what damage is done to a person's reputation as long as it's not you and you get enough suckers to believe every word and vote for you. <br>  <br>  I consider myself a Moderate and was leaning toward McCain. Then he allowed his campaign managers to take over and start all this misinformation about Obama. Sad thing is, so many believe everything they hear or read. They say they've done the research when in reality all they've done is listen to and read what the promoters of the lies have to say rather than do honest research to separate the lies from the facts.<br>  <br>  I won't be voting for McCain this time around.<br>  <br>  |`|1hOTlMvaaa	It is  not a plus for McCain he and his Pal Plain are a disgrace and horrible embarrassment to this country, the lack of leadership is telling and like Plain has said "Thanks but NO THANKS"  They are insulting voters unless they hope to win on people that do not pay attention or have dropped out of school and are not knowledgeable|`|ib2BLbDTaa	My vote will never change.

5Ho518J9aa	Because it was "Gerries". 'German' was always abbreviated as 'Ger.' in all of the British documentation.

In Obama's case the beginning is the also the end.|`|ee7afa2284dbb71d60c6d9445eb13af8aa	the deal is that Obama cannot produce a valid birth certificate and as you should know, the only three qualifications to be president are:<br>  <br>  1) must be 35 years of age<br>  2) must have lived in US fourteen years<br>  3) must be a natural born citizen<br>  <br>  Number three is the problem. The document produced by the DNC in August is altered and not valid. What is he hiding? We ALL have to produce our birth certificates at some point - marriage, driver's license, military, etc. Why does BO not have to comply with this requirement? This will become a constitutional nightmare if it does not get resolved before he is sworn in. If it is found later that he was born in Kenya and HI just allowed registration, every bill that he signs will be invalid. Not to mention that would make him and Howard Dean criminals.<br>  <br>

To enlist and go to WO school, you would have to enlist in another job and apply to be a pilot while you are in service.  It's going to be at least a six year commitment and it will be a year or two before you're even going before the board to apply for warrant.  You could go to college and do OCS and request aviation but they may not work either.  Everybody has helicopters.  There's a joke: So, is your helicopter broken?  It will be.  They break a lot because they are highly complicated machines with a lot of stress on them.  It happens.  How easy it is depends on what kind of equipment you're using to shoot it down and the tactics of the pilot.  It doesn't happen a lot.  Sometimes helicopters are used to carry troops into battle or medevac them away from an engagement.  That can be dangerous.|`|Yvi4jBnqaa	You would be a warrant Officer,I believe it would like the commissioned officer.If so you could resign just about any time you wanted.Ask a local recruiter about your concerns and if you join as a helicopter pilot in any branch of service,get a written contract for your conditions of being accepted into the aviation program and if you dont complete it then you opt to leave the service if you so desire.
AA11702773	Because that makes tyranny of the majority over the minority too easy.|`|SBhVZD4Xaa	Read Federalist 10. A "true" democracy shows no concern for minority rights. A large, non-homogeneous republic prevents any one faction from gaining too much political power whilst refining public opinion.|`|AA12041497	By "true" democracy I'm assuming you mean governed by the people. Best the answer to that would be why did the framers of Constitution create a democratic republic government instead of a democratic government. That's simple, the framers wanted to create a government with checks and balances. They wanted people to have power but they didn't want to give all the power to the people because that would create a tyranny of majority. Keep in mind that framers were all opulent aristocrats with real estate and naturally they had the incentive to look out for themselves. They also look like historic events like French revolution where the majority of the people massacred the ruling class. So they created a complicated system where people have considerable power but at the same time, they're not given all the power.|`|AA12020119	Because our forefathers knew the danger of "majority rule" with no protection of the minority. That is not how a Representative Republic works, and that is why it takes 2/3 majority to stop some things and/or pass Constitutional amendments! Including all the states!<br>  <br>  If we were a "true Democracy", and I would defy anyone to show me one, this country would no longer exist!<br>  <br>  "I am getting a little tired of hearing about the sacred rights of the majority; that this is a country ruled by the majority; and that the majority has the right to have its way. This is not a country ruled by the majority. This is not a country of majority rule. The Constitution of the United States was written, in large part, to prevent majority rule. The Declaration of Independence was an announcement that there are limitations upon majority rule.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness were declared in the Declaration to be inalienable rights. They could not be given away by the citizen himself. Much less could they be taken away by temporary agents, sitting in legislative bodies, holding a limited authority of brief duration.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Constitution itself is a direct limitation upon majority rule. "You shall not take property without due process of law," says the Constitution, and before we can take that safeguard away what must we do? We must obtain not a majority by this body, not a majority of the House of Representatives," but a two-thirds majority in each House concurring in a resolution, and that resolution must be approved by three fourths of the States. What about majority rule in connection with that proposition?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The right to trial by jury can not be taken away by majority rule. The right for the habitation of the citizen to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures can not be taken away by majority rule. If it could have been so taken away, Volstead and his like would have invaded every home of America and fanaticism would have thrust its ugly face into every home of this land...Before you can trample upon certain rights of the American people you must have more than a majority, Sir, and I believe it to be true that there are certain rights which even by amending the Constitution of the United States, we can not take away from the citizens of the United States.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Majority rule! Where is the logic or the reason to be found back of majority rule except in the mere necessity to dispatch business? The fact that a majority of 1 or 10 vote for a bill in the Senate is not a certification that the action is right. The majority has been wrong oftener than it has been right in all the course of time. The majority crucified Jesus Christ. The majority burned the Christians at the stake. The majority drove the Jews into exile and the ghetto. The majority established slavery. The majority set up innumerable gibbets. The majority chained to stakes and surrounded with circles of flame martyrs through all the ages of the world's history. The majority in China believe in a doctrine and follow a code of ethics different from ours. Either they are wrong or we are wrong. The majority in India follow a different code of ethics and have a different set of ideas than we, and they far out number us. Either they are wrong or we are wrong."<br>  <br>  Excerpts From Speech By Senator James A. Reed Of Missouri<br>  (U.S. Senate, June 4, 1926)<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|prahKrpjaa	Because a Democracy means that majority rules, regardless of whether those decisions violate the rights of an individual.<br>  <br>  The founding fathers warned against that.  |`|kwT9HCYWaa	by true, I assume you mean direct.

F6IOLf3Aaa	I don't know about age limits as such but I do believe that we should not be permitting every Dick and Jane that comes along with enough money between them to purchase a marriage license, to just start having babies in which they do not have the knowledge or means to successfully raise. This is exactly what leads to welfare dependence and is destroying our basic social structure as well as the economy. Take the over population of our jails, prisons, and mental institutions for example, what is state government's answer to that?  Well, lets spend countless millions of dollars and build some more jails, prisons, and mental institutions. There, see, the problem is solved for at least another 10 years.  A dysfunctional family unit is the core problem with our American society and economy today.  If we put a 1 year educational/fitness requirement on couples wanting to obtain a marriage license, we'd weed out 90% of those doomed marriages before they even got started. Think of the lives that would be made better off because of it, and the tax money saved as well.  Create a better, stronger better informed family unit and you will in time do the same for society as a whole.<br>  <br>  Now, teen pregnancy and couples just living together and having children outside of marriage, there are non-invasive technology that can be used to keep a couple from becoming pregnant until they have meant society's fitness requirements. That technology should be mandatory for the individual until successfully married. At which time, the technology (an implant perhaps) could be neutralized (reversed) in some fashion leaving the couple reproductive fertile. That certainly would solve a lot of social concerns and worries for parents and for humanity in general.<br>  <br>  If we did just these few simple things, in no time our country and world would be a lot better place than it is today.|`|IWlPfk1raa	No I don't, it is a couples choice to have as many children as they want at whatever age they want. Though I do think people should be educated about the risk of having children at an age out of the norm and take personal responsibility for having as many children as they want. I do not think their should be any government intervention in this natural course of human life|`|DFwvcUnhaa	It would be futile. Unless the goal was to punish children and young adults.

The world is becoming too overpopulated and there's too many kids without homes.

That way you might drill in two weeks or in four weeks.   You do not know.  So you are at risk of drug testing within two weeks no matter what you do.   And two weeks will catch you if you do drugs.<br>  <br>  Also,  another unit each time they have an unplanned or unexpected call up,  they have everyone supply some urine.

AA10690306	Considering your question is growing into a possible military coup I think it needs an answer.<br>  <br>  The officials from all 50 states had to certify that he had met the requirements for candidacy for president.  He had to follow the documentation rules the Republicans forced through under threat to the states.  So you are saying that ALL of the OFFICIALS in control of that certification messed up their job so badly that their action are invalid?  And you Republicans accuse every one ELSE of Conspiracy theories!<br>  <br>  The ONLY way your supposed conspiracy could work was if over 100 Republican and Democratic officials either purposely or through mistakes did not check the paperwork he had to give each state before he could be certified as a Candidate for president.  You could not keep a group that large quiet about such a thing.<br>  <br>  Are you saying you would rather see a military take over of the government like so many other Republicans?|`|m5J36D28aa	As long as the govt is convinced he is a US citizen, you're wasting your time and ours.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Great....since you are so proud to be an American....please send  your personal birth record to all of us at YAnswers so that we can verify that you are actually a Citizen!!

If one denies even those one disagrees with the right to state their case one drives their political views underground and eventually a violent reaction often occurs.<br>  <br>  One should perhaps think of Voltaire's axiom - can't remember the exact wording - 'I dislike what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.'|`|cSC57byOaa	The answer to this question must be relative. One cannot say that free speech is non-existent, but rather people can say anything they like but then must face the consequences of the effect they have caused.<br>  <br>  In the UK, citizens may argue that free speech does not exist, or they may question its existence. But the reality is quite apart from some peoples' truth. One only has to look at a newspaper to see the freedom of criticism that can be aimed at our politicians and local governments, the hallmarks of a democratic society. This speech however must not overstep set boundaries, in that, citizens publishers and journalists have the right to criticise but do not have the right to offend (unless as a fair retort in the heat of the moment, but again must be in proportion to the original offence). <br>  <br>  Freedom of speech must not unjustifiably injure the persons character in the minds of a right thinking member of society or it shall be deemed slander or defamation of character. What a 'right thinking member of society' curtails is beyond the scope of this answer and would deviate from the main purpose of this condensed lecture!<br>  <br>  So, you and I have the right to criticise the current Prime Ministers handling of certain affairs or the proposals of a new law or past law, we may highlight criminal behaviours and the culprits in the news, and we can scrutinize the running of our cities by local governments. All of this maintains a certain standardin our society as a whole that ensures it does not fall into a dictatorship.<br>  <br>  This allows me to explain the neccessity to look at this topic with relation to freedom of speech in other societies.<br>  If I were a Chinese citizen and I criticised the government in any area, the chances are I (and quite possibly my family) would be seriously punished for it. Only 30 years ago were the Chinese government were killing their own people, especially their educated members of society for having the potentiallity to speak out against their government. The numbers of deaths are momentously astounding, 200milion+ killed by their own government between the 30's and 70's in China, perhaps more. These number make Stalins 20million and Hitlers 6million seem small, and these killing were not made on their own people! The very fact that we are discussing hether or not freedom of speech exists proves that to so degree that it does. This type of discussion may be monitored in China. Here our government won't even pay attention to what we are talking about.<br>  <br>  Have you ever wondered what would happen to you if you criticised the government of Iran? Chances are you may be hanged. What news do you think is allowed to be printed in the newspapers in Iran. Once a non-Islamic country, since 1979, Iran has been an Islamic republic. What would happen to an Iranian muslim if they said in front of a policeman 'I have had a change of heart , I don't believe in God I want to say that the government is wrong in forcing this religion upon my people and my country'? They would be charged with 'denial of God'. <br>  <br>  However, in the UK, anybody can openly criticise the government and may even poke fun at them.<br>  <br>  China and Iran are not the only countries in the world that such tragic injustices happen they are merely use as an example for the question of freedom of speech in the west to be related to. If you are Iranian or Chinese and have been offended in anyway by any human inaccuracy of my writings then please do accept my dearest and heartfelt apologies in advance.<br>  <br>  So my answer to the question 'Does free speech exist' is yes, especially in relation to other countries in the world in which we live. I must add however that one must be aware of the consequences of what they say. <br>  <br>  A quick example would be when Jeremy Clarkson recently made a racist and morbid remark about the Prime Minister of his own coutry, an apology was all that was required. It wasn't banned and he was not assasinated for his comments.   <br>  <br>  People will find that if they overstep the mark with a comment it wil be stopped or later removed, what one must learn is to be more tactful in the way the say something, for example I might not say that your bottom is looking exceedingly larger but might say that your jeans are looking a little tighter! <br>  <br>  You can express your messages!|`|mXbQFNP5aa	only as long as it is in lock step with the democrats.

WISCONSIN, 466 U.S. 740 (1984) <br>  466 U.S. 740 <br>  WELSH v. WISCONSIN <br>  CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF WISCONSIN <br>  <br>  No. 82-5466. <br>  <br>  Argued October 5, 1983 <br>  Decided May 15, 1984 <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  On the night of April 24, 1978, a witness observed a car that was being driven erratically and that eventually swerved off the road, coming to a stop in a field without causing damage to any person or property. Ignoring the witness' suggestion that he wait for assistance in removing his car, the driver walked away from the scene. The police arrived a few minutes later and were told by the witness that the driver was either very inebriated or very sick. After checking the car's registration, the police, without obtaining a warrant, proceeded to the petitioner's nearby home, arriving at about 9 p. m. They gained entry when petitioner's stepdaughter answered the door, and found petitioner lying naked in bed. Petitioner was then arrested for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant in violation of a Wisconsin statute which provided that a first offense was a noncriminal violation subject to a civil forfeiture proceeding for a maximum fine of $200. Petitioner was taken to the police station, where he refused to submit to a breath-analysis test. Pursuant to Wisconsin statutes, which subjected an arrestee who refused to take the test to the risk of a 60-day revocation of driving privileges, petitioner requested a court hearing to determine whether his refusal was reasonable. Under Wisconsin law, a refusal to take a breath test was reasonable if the underlying arrest was not lawful. The trial court, ultimately concluding that petitioner's arrest was lawful and that his refusal to take the breath test was therefore unreasonable, issued an order suspending petitioner's license. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals vacated the order, concluding that the warrantless arrest of petitioner in his home violated the Fourth Amendment because the State, although demonstrating probable cause to arrest, had not established the existence of exigent circumstances. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed. <br>  <br>  Held: <br>  <br>  The warrantless, nighttime entry of petitioner's home to arrest him for a civil, nonjailable traffic offense, was prohibited by the special protection afforded the individual in his home by the Fourth Amendment. Pp. 748-754. <br>  <br>  <br>  (a) Before government agents may invade the sanctity of the home, the government must demonstrate exigent circumstances that overcome the presumption of unreasonableness that attaches to all warrantless home entries. An important factor to be considered when determining [466 U.S. 740, 741]   whether any exigency exists is the gravity of the underlying offense for which the arrest is being made. Moreover, although no exigency is created simply because there is probable cause to believe that a serious crime has been committed, application of the exigent-circumstances exception in the context of a home entry should rarely be sanctioned when there is probable cause to believe that only a minor offense has been committed. Pp. 748-753. <br>  <br>  (b) Petitioner's warrantless arrest in the privacy of his own bedroom for a noncriminal traffic offense cannot be justified on the basis of the "hot pursuit" doctrine, because there was no immediate or continuous pursuit of the petitioner from the scene of a crime, or on the basis of a threat to public safety, because petitioner had already arrived home and had abandoned his car at the scene of the accident. Nor can the arrest be justified as necessary to preserve evidence of petitioner's blood-alcohol level. Even assuming that the underlying facts would support a finding of this exigent circumstance, given the fact that the State had chosen to classify the first offense for driving while intoxicated as a noncriminal, civil forfeiture offense for which no imprisonment was possible, a warrantless home arrest cannot be upheld simply because evidence of the petitioner's blood-alcohol level might have dissipated while the police obtained a warrant.

Since the present CEC is to retire on 20th April, the next CEC is to be appointed. Under normal circumstances, such appointment fairly in advance is not improper. But the question has arisen because (a) Navin Chawla is under a cloud of suspicion (b) recommendation for his removal has been made by the CEC but no accepted by the government (c) Constitution is silent whether the recommendation is binding on thegovernment or not, till it is resolved by the Supreme Court, by interpretation or by a Constitutional amendment (d) the ruling party has been overly and overtly supportive of Navin <br>  Chawla(E) Curiously the ruling party cites seniority as the basis whereas it has a notorious record of supercessions (recall resignations of Justices AN.Grover, J.M.Shelat and K.P.Hegde in 1974) and hardly elevating Vice-Presidents as President.<br>  Appointment as such is valid in law per-se. It is also not any violation of election code. Propriety however is in question. Eligibility too would be questioned later in some case before the Supreme Court.<br>  See the scenario but for the appointment. The electoral process would be midway on 21st April. There would have been only two ECs without a CEC. Decisions, as per earlierdecision of the Supreme court are to be taken by consensus, failing which by majority. What would happen if the two ECs differ on any issue ? There would be no mechanism in place to take decisions, in the absence of a third vote. Government can not appoint a third election commissioner as there would be no vacancy in the office of EC.<br>  So, however unwelcome, the appointment is not invalid, till the constitutional issue of the binding nature or otherwise of the recommendation of CEC, is resolved by the Supreme Court.

He asked me what I had planned to do and I said "Guess I better get a job."  So yes, you can get a job. As for the wages, I did $132,000 last year, as a journeyman, according to my tax return.

5BiBamrxaa	If the keys are in the car or on your person then yes you can be.<br>  <br>  f|`|0MunIx8raa	Typically you can get a DUI if you are in the car and the keys are in the ignition whether it's running or not.  I'm not quite sure that you could for just simply being asleep in the back seat and drunk.  Assuming you were drunk to get yourself there to the middle of no where will probably not play well with the police though.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	Yes, you definitely can.  You are in "physical control" of the vehicle and you can wake up and drive any time that you want.  The courts have upheld decisions and convictions because - <br>  <br>  You must have been drunk at the time you were driving to get to "the middle of nowhere".<br>  <br>  You will be charged and your life will be ruined.  This happened to someone I know.  They couldn't afford a lawyer so they took a plea.<br>  Lost license, jail time, classes, Breathalyzer on their car, everything.  If you are even thinking of going out drinking, take a cab.|`|376a0b518236d45e27355ee9bd22da43aa	if you have the keys on your person or in the car, yes you are guilty of being drunk in-charge of a car.<br>  the best thing to do is hide the keys somewhere out side the car before you go to sleep then if the police come you just say your mate has copped off and got the keys with him|`|TMAq2m7Gaa	Only if the keys are in the ignition. There is nothing else they can prove otherwise. You could have driven out there sober. Taken a walk, got drunk and gone back to the car to sleep it off.|`|iRXraQWyaa	If you are on a public road and have the keys and ability to drive then yes.  If you are on private land then I would guess no unless they could prove you have driven on a public highway.|`|DjHWw3h3aa	yea|`|WJjkq7lTaa	This is a novel situation in UK law; if the vehicle was on a public road or byway then the burden of proof is reversed ie it's up to you to prove you had no intention of driving. If you can't you are as good as driving...<br>  <br>  The standard demonstration of your intent not to drive is leaving the keys with a 3rd party (friend, landlord etc.)|`|vKlMdtpaaa	yes you can because you are still in the vehicle with the keys. if say a friend had taken the keys home with him then they cant do you for it but as long as you are in the car, weith the car keys then yes, you can get done for it.....unless you are on private land then they cant!|`|1hLxd5DWaa	well how did u get into the middle of nowhere without driving drunk? i suppose this is there thinking because even if u did drink there and were sober before hand there is no proof in that.|`|jz9cqjZpaa	yes you can and it stays on your licence for 11 years|`|p6o0LoY6aa	Only if you have your keys on you.|`|5df269977f7c0720cf1bea0e2305a94faa	if you ha vent got the keys on you, then there is more of a chance for you to get awaywith it|`|bhNaTYjOaa	Most certainly, and quite right too.|`|9EvIdkYSaa	apparently... yes<br>  but i dont see why... its our car... our propety... i'll do what ever i like in the back of my car.

Even better.|`|xcvuJfKMaa	Anyone can sue for anything, the problem here is that you have not suffered any loss due to the statements made and you will have the burden to prove you are not a gang member.  If any of the guys in your car were affiliated with a gang, then the paper did not defame, they spoke in generalities and did not specifically state you as an individual, so they spoke the truth. As far as the prosecuting attorney, he also spoke that the men CLAIMED to be in a gang, he never said you were in a gang,so who in your car admitted to being in a gang?  Even if anyone admitted to this,The attorney only speaks in generalities and there is no defamation. If any of them are gang members then redeem yourself by not hanging out with individuals who are affiliated.|`|e27fe1a9205b53137b4cbd03b8a47947aa	Yes, you can sue but you won't win.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	People sue for just about anything today..winning a case is another story

It means ANY country that captures you can choose to prosecute you under their laws.|`|GHPZlhAwaa	Yes, because if you rape someone in international waters, you are obviously aboard a ship. That ship is registered in a country and the actions aboard that ship are governed by that country.  If it occurred at sea, it would be reported and either when you docked or when an officer was sent out to sea to pick you up you would be arrested and tried for rape.<br>  <br>  whale<br>  <br>  Logic 316 , you are absolutely WRONG, if any country boards a vessel that is flagged to another nation that is an act of war.  A vessel in international water belongs to the country it is flagged to and no other nations ships may board her without permission.|`|LnWOSedEaa	Let's rephrase the question.  If you rape someone can you have your "male member " removed and be dragged through the street behind a gas guzzling V8 , and be skinned alive hanging from a courthouse tree for all the public to watch?  <br>  <br>  The politically incorrect answer, You should be and you deserve more than that.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	The authorities can come aboard the boat and arrest you|`|cmreZoSAaa	Yes.

And what is being done now is based upon the successes and failures of the 30's. The economic side of this is fairly straight forward but the biggest toughest part is the psychological battle of getting America out of the fear mode GWB rammed down our throats for 7 years with his "we're not yet safe" speeches and uniting the country behind recovery.

Destroying the root of our economy by obstructing access to any economical fuel sources including oil, natural gas, nuclear energy, hydro electric, clean coal and anything else that could sustain a healthy economy. Fuel is the very core of our economy and they crushed it.<br>  <br>  2. The democrats deliberately pushed the core of the credit crisis, and ignored warnings that things were being done by Freddy Mac and Fannie Mae that would be very harmful to our economy, by the Bush administration, and even John McCain. The democrats buddies in Freddy Mac and Fannie May (powerful advisers in the Obama campaign and huge democrat contributors to Obama, Frank, Dodd, Waters, and Reid among other democrats started out on a dangerous course, lied to investors about the status of the investment, and caused the credit crisis and the bringing down of banks and insurance companies because of those investments becoming worthless as collateral, making those institutions illiquid and thus unable to legally do business ... this sent a chill through all lending institutions and froze up credit which has lead to this disaster in the economy ... accomplished by democrats with a few idiot republicans help. The worst thing any republican ever did in the last 8 years, even 16, was to go along with democrats and try to work with them. They are the bane of the US economy, and it was caused by their lust for power and their greed ... as well as the accomplice of the liberal media and entertainment industry in this country working to push their lies and deceptions on the people of the US, and even the rest of the world.<br>  <br>  Fuel being so high was the catalyst that caused the problems with the mortgage backed securities to come out like they did, and this destroyed the backbone of commerce and industry in the US and weighed so heavy on the world that the rest of the world could not bear the weight.<br>  <br>  I also think China was deliberately driving up fuel prices and pushing things to a head, maybe working with some US politicians like the Clintons to make this happen, so things would be ripe for Hilary's presidential bid. This kind of thing is classic Clinton, if you really know how the man has worked in the past to get what he wanted. His mob exploits are long and detailed, and he thinks very big of course, afraid of nothing and knowing no limits.<br>  <br>  This whole thing has effected the entire world, and it all goes back to what democrats have been pushing for decades. The press has been with them. The press is actually THE power, as they inform the voting public, or in the last decades they deliberately misinform the public to help the democrats gain power.<br>  <br>  There are billionaires pouring money into this thing, like George Soros who started moveon.org.<br>  <br>  The media is owned by the rich billionaires, and almost all of it is on board with the new democrat fascist movement. GE (the corporation who helped out Iran by doing business with them long after it was banned for US companies) owns NBC and has totally gone in the tank for the left, and Obama gives them a thrill up their legs right? GE is about to get some huge porker stimulus contracts for wind turbine products ... Obama and the democrats pretty much run NBC.<br>  <br>  The entertainment industry is owned almost in total by billionaire democrats, and they use it to push out propaganda daily, cutting off all that would dissent from their brain washing leftist consistency. This is an extremely powerful instrument, and they know it. They even get to Republican leaders who spew their crap to be more in with the populous. They run down black people who would be republicans, and run up "keepin it real" which means resentful anti social white hating and thug culture which is counter productive to the welfare of the black communities just to keep them as leftist voting blocks, and they are working on the Mexican populations as well with that crap.<br>  <br>  The democrats have the Harvard elite alumni and others in that group working on their project, and when you look at colleges they are almost all extreme leftist mind bending camps, more than educational institutions. They are warping our kids text books. The teachers Union are huge and powerful and insist on leftifying the children in public school.<br>  <br>  Even the UN is on attack towards republicans in the US, and the US itself actually. Doing studies on race relations, in the US? In the country which has the best record on this in the world? Why? You know why. Their bogus standard of living assessment obviously reverse engineered with criteria cherry picked to place the US down the list, using ridicules categories and weight of such information to make sure  the US doesn't come out well. It's a real laugh when you look at how they do it, a total scam job to skew perception of the realities. <br>  <br>  There is even much more to it, much more than you can fit here, but check things out for yourself.<br>  <br>  It's all culminated right here and right now, and they are making a run at the country, total control of the country. This is a coup, a hostile take over.|`|CBmizuGwaa	..."Barry", "Harry" and Nancy are the contemporary clones of "Moe, Larry & Curly" !  ...watching this trilogy of horrors is like watching "Willey Coyote" trying to catch the Roadrunner !

Churchill could have come out and said "It looks pretty dark and it will probably get even worse soon."  Stalin could have said "We don't really know what we're doing and we're just holding on by our fingernails, or less." and Roosevelt could have said "We don't have an army, and our navy was just crippled.  I have no idea how we will be able to prosecute this war."<br>  <br>  All of them would have been correct but it is hard to see how that would have helped the situation.  With Obama it is a question of emphasis.  He is emphasizing that he believes that things will get worse (true, as in my above example).  If instead he said something along the lines of "You know we still have some bumps in the road ahead of us but I am firmly of the belief that this country and its people will quickly move out of this downturn." (Still true but with the emphasis on the recovery rather than the low point).  I hope that helps.<br>  <br>  The stock market and consumer confidence all are based on perceptions.

lVjBfpYOaa	You may call them "pro-choice" or whatever, but the reason other people get involved in situations such as slavery or abortion is because it is the scenario where one human has control over another. If a society is based on equality, then a master-slave situation cannot be condoned. Similarly with abortion, the mother has the power to take away the potential life of another individual (the embryo) and if she is given free reign over this power ("choice") then that again is a lack of equality of life.|`|JV75Iz3eaa	I am a slave, to the leftist "compassion" schemes.

At that time, he said PUBLICALLY and IN WRITING that it was his goal to turn America into a third-world socialist country and eliminate its status as a world super power once and for all, so that Europe, China and other nations could "have their turn" at running the world.  He absolutely hates and despises our influence on the world and he has the money to destroy us.<br>  <br>  Soros bankrolled Gore, then bankrolled Kerry.  With Obama he found the perfect tool.  Rahm Emanuel and Soros came up with a plan to take over the nation and deliver on Soros's dream in exchange for power.  <br>  <br>  For the past 4 years, Soros bought a huge chunk of the money market.  Then, in September, just in time for the elections, he sold it all at once, triggering the current economic disaster.  They created millions of fake "donors" but it was almost all Soros's money.  Soros BOUGHT the presidency, knowing full well that Obama would fulfill his dreams.  Soros is also very big on gun control, because he wants America disarmed and easier to take over.<br>  <br>  Emanuel planned for the economic disaster and continues to capitalize on it to push through any agenda that they want, knowing full well that they can play with people's emotions.  And they are pushing through an ultra-socialist agenda while at the same time pulling back America's military and world influence.  By the time they are finished, we will be a third-world nation, with massive debt, soaring inflation, a weakened military, and raging unemployment.<br>  <br>  Most of the world thought Obama was an interesting personality (the Germans marvelled that he was "Der Schwartze J.F.K." for example), but they also understood that he was as experienced for the job as you or me.  Think about it.  Your dentist actually has more experience as an executive than Obama did (simply because he runs a business).  Or the person who runs a McDonalds!  Or even the person who works at a McDonalds!<br>  <br>  But we elected him anyway, all based on his personality.  Obama is an expert at Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP), a vocal technique that is a kind of hypnosis.  Sales people learn to do it, it is a technique that can be learned, and it works on 75-80% of all people.  Obama is a master.  That's why most people don't even realize what is happening and remain oblivious.<br>  <br>  China and other countries will not stop buying up our debt.  The complaints are just for public consumption.  In fact, they will accelerate it.  Within the next 8 years, China and other nations will legally OWN the United States, and thereby take it over without firing a single shot.<br>  <br>  The master plan of George Soros is working.<br>  <br>  The only catch to the scheme is that Americans, once they wake up, are still a mighty unified force.  Once things get that bad, and Americans realize what's been done to our nation, they will be furious.  And that will trigger a war unlike anything the world has ever seen.<br>  <br>  It's sad that it will have to come to that, but by the time Obama and Soros are done, that is the way that things are headed.|`|1ymL5LKlaa	No surprise to me that the Chinese are considering different investments, the US government is not a good risk with their track record of spend, spend , spend and never reducing the debt.|`|Ocyrox5baa	It would appear that THE WORLD is not as smitten with this guy as his apologists would attempt to lead one to believe.|`|gdRhkxmqaa	i think they should issues new invetment fund|`|HLHHM4Mtaa	Other countries view us in the same manner you might view an irresponsible neighbor who can't make the payments on their house, their two new cars, their fancy new furniture, or their once a month gambling get-a-way to Las Vegas.

Unless they've already been hocked, they may be safe.<br>  The other possibility is that by the Constitutional Act of 1871, which made D.C. a district unto itself, created turned the government into a corporation, which legally can not rule a sovereign nation or state. Also, the laws they make, in reality, are not transferable to any government outside their borders, from the way it has been explained to me. <br>  This is much like The Vatican, being in Rome, but not under Italian common law.

He declined to elaborate on the assurances needed by China, the biggest foreign holder of U.S. government debt.<br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  Something big is getting ready to give way...|`|fbeba5dc300a1f4a43941be04a82654aaa	Of course their thinking about it,  They probably will fundus and therefore maintain more political control over us, as they know we need them.

d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	I am all for working together. The problem at this time is that no one seems to be willing to compromise on either side. Both sides want it their way or no way at all. Unless you are willing to engage in give and take on these issues no meaningful cooperation can be achieved.|`|JV75Iz3eaa	In my lifetime, the words "bipartisan support" have always translated into more of my property leaving my wallet and going to government.<br>  <br>  If it's so important to work together, shouldn't the colonists in 1776 have simply worked together with the British?  Thank goodness those cranky colonists weren't interested in "bipartisan support" when dealing with the British.  Too bad the great country they created has been hijacked by the moochers.<br>  <br>  I prefer the battle of ideas, with winning ideas taking the day and losing ideas going away.|`|xkcLOfTKaa	Does work together mean OUR WAY?<br>  I recall more than 60 different amendments to the stimulus bill introduced by republicans that didn't even make it to the floor...

AA11370645	I am a conservative, however, I would support the following actions:<br>  <br>  First, contact the local law enforcement agency immediately. They would detain the father and help the girl receive medical aid. Part of this medical aid should include administering an emergency contraceptive (like a "morning after" pill) immediately to stop any possible pregnancy before conception has occurred.<br>  <br>  If this did not play out, and the girl did end up pregnant, I would support an abortion. This is a lose-lose situation. The girl's life will be ruined, and the baby would be brought up in a broken household. Also there would be a high risk of birth defect due to the age of the mother.|`|Fy54FMemaa	Lets also not forget that a 9 year old's body cannot provide a fetus the vitamins it needs for proper development. The lives of both are in danger and to be honest, why should a 9 year old have to go thru the physical changes and give birth to a baby conceived from rape, whether it goes up for adoption or kept. This was not the choice of a child. <br>  <br>  This is not only dangerous to the lives but also not the condition to bring a child into this world and the step father should be castrated for doing this to a baby. Please tell me something is being done to that animal!|`|579276f1a955ed5c170f87a86360c3b2aa	Wizjp has it right that only a doctor can make the determination of risk. But the decision to abort would typically be the moms. IDK about the specific situation you are referring to, but its also possible that if the mother is more about protecting the step father, then social services should make the determination. <br>  I was raped and got preg at 12. Didnt realize i was even preg until I was 7 months along. Had the child a month after my 13th birthday. Gave her up for adoption, which was my decision.|`|AA10118655	It all depends on your beliefs. For me, I believe this would be a good example of having the choice for abortion. But, a 9 year old is probably not mentally capable of making an informed choice on the subject. If the mother had nothing to do with the step father raping the child, she should be the one to make the decision. If she was involved in any degree, then the courts should weigh all the options and make the decision for the child.|`|MYU46ap5aa	I think she should get an abortion.  First of all if she is risking her life then it should be done (abortion).  Not only that she was raped by her step father and she is still a baby, she can't quite possibly raise those children.|`|s3E3KfBsaa	I am conservative, but I am pro-choice. Of course she should get an abortion, and the stepfather should get his nuts shot off!|`|Vgk8VnXwaa	Let's see:  A father commits a crime and his child should be executed for the crime. Does this really make sense to you?|`|hWvvrEphaa	I know people who have had abortions. Maybe having an abortion would be more detrimental to this child then her actually having the baby (minus the responsibilities). Do you know how an abortion is actually preformed? I do. I saw. You'll never ever in your life get that image out of your head and from what I've been told the physical pain lasts a lifetime.<br>  <br>  However, I don't know. I would have to give this a lot of thought. 9 year old giving birth or 9 year old having her uterus gutted at. It really would be a hard decision.<br>  <br>  Poor innocent child. I was molested when I was a child. Hearing things like this breaks my heart.|`|sbIIV8Dvaa	This is really tragic news but Lina Medina was a hoax, the only evidence they have is family testimonies and fake photographs, a girl of five could not give birth, it against all Natural law! Plus don't forget that this was in 1939 before the internet and mass media, it was easy to spread chinese whispers.<br>  <br>  The 9 year old girl should get an abortion, no matter what religion she or her family is, it is wrong full stop, she is a child and should get the chance to grow up in her own time (i know there is not much chance of that now).|`|28yqlxPuaa	If this were my daughter she would absolutely have an abortion. But then I would also do bad things to the step Father.|`|AA11206283	Only a qualified physician should make the decision IF she can carry to term; and if she should for medical reasons abort. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, he won't be the one to decide what happens here unless a court gets involved.|`|AA12103453	It tells me we need to do something about a 9 y/o getting pregnant as well. They shouldn't be going through puberty that young, and I know it can happen(at least I think that is close to the youngest recorded age). The truth is that there is a reason that females can't have babies before puberty, and reason they normally don't go through puberty until an older age. Anyway personally I'm for abortion being legal simply because it's going to happen so it is better that we can regulate it, and it's also better for the doctor who KNOWS the woman is going to leave and commit an abortion on herself if the doctor can't tell her where else to go.|`|Y3jNg93vaa	I think that she should get an abortion. Im against abortions but this isnt right. She was so young, raped, and she can die. I think she should get an abortion, but it also has to do with her beliefes even though she's so young.|`|oojO4WAraa	Most definitely.  She should get an abortion.  That is the ONLY right thing to do in this situation.|`|T864ejaiaa	in a situation like this then yes they, the parents should have an abortion done. poor kid. did the baztard go to jail?|`|wbIEau0qaa	they have a choice

AA12181502	An obvious paraphrase of Nick Griffen, the BNP leader, which is generally touted by another of our esteemed "answerers" here whenever he is debunking anything that Rule Britannia answers or asks.  So it's a well trotted out piece of verse with a very thin veil over it.  <br>  <br>  So what is your intention with this substitution is it to inflame the indigenous "patriotic" population of these islands with this rhetoric and have them screaming for the nearest mullahs blood, only to say, Yah boo sucks to you, it was actually said by an Englishman?<br>  <br>  If so then it is a fairly lame attempt and I would have actually expected better from the "Top contributor".  For the record similar diatribes have been aired by the likes of Abu Hamza and other hate preachers on our streets for some time now.

They have been taxing us to death. They want us to spend our money to take a conceal carry course to be able to carry a weapon for protection, along with us also paying for our own background check.

Thousands of recalls for years while many are sickened and dying, not to mention they have not done enough to stem crime. Gang members, drugs, murderers, rapists, are getting away with what they are doing, and I truly believe many will start turning vigilante to stop what the government will not. So much for our rights!|`|AA11313983	Well informed people do.|`|AA11031560	If you think it's bad now, wait until China starts calling in its chips!|`|cVEHvqxEaa	No.  I don't.  Did you think it was "getting too big" when Bush grew it to its present size?|`|hpzfccwaaa	They never start anything they can not finish. Their troops are marching onward across the landscapes with vast migrations as an eagle would fly and the people clutched in their claws devoured of their right to life by the piercing eyes of that mighty bird and the deliberate strike of it's beak- policies.|`|RLoilwCNaa	Yes. The second ammendment was put into place so that we could protect ourselves from a tyranical government. Good luck taking mine.|`|AA12205273	Yeah, will ya tell them to move over? I can't breath.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	declaring sovereignty is the best way to go (29 states and counting...secession is a last resort).  if the federal government steps foot in your state, they can be arrested and prosecuted for crimes against the Constitution.  When martial law is  declared and the military crosses sovereign state lines, then we can shoot back. hopefully the military will not follow such unconstitutional  orders as to war against their own people. I can only hope.

Doing the right thing by yourself is considered selfish, while gaming the system is considered needy.|`|AA10331255	Envy won't help you get ahead.  We ALL have problems we're trying to overcome.

He lives off everybody(not me) and spends his money on Jordans and drugs. I just analyze my quality of life compared to his and that makes me feel better.

You and I pay for it.|`|AA11660242	Yeah, that's very messed up. Look at the beauty of it though. We're living in a country where the nice guy will always finish last. People like the guy down the street are abusing the system, while honest people like you have to suffer. Is that right? Absolutely not! My family and I live in a half-built home that we've been building for the past four years, we pay all our bills, we all work and pitch in to make ends meet, and we're barely making it alive. Meanwhile, lazy drunk bastards along with their pregnant housewives and seven kids are having cookouts everyday with food and shelter provided by the government. That's just the way it is.|`|CGr6EtRUaa	In the US you have to have private health insurance, free healthcare is only available for the poor. I assume you know that.<br>  <br>  Don't knock the guy down the street until you've walked a mile in his shoes.<br>  <br>  Better a system like we have in the UK, where everyone is covered by national insurance. At work your employer and you pay contributions out of your wages. If out of work the same system covers you if you need hospital treatment.|`|JlbxqSM6aa	the more you think about it the angrier you get, do yourself a favor and think not of how you have been mistreated but of how lucky you are you will one day be able to buy a car, when life is difficult look to the good and not the bad and you will always come out the winner in the end.|`|BL4PEjAWaa	give us your unemployed, your criminals, your drug addicts and we will care for them as no one else can.<br>    been going on for years.  these are the only people who have time to vote.<br>    the 2 things that scare a politician are women, THEY VOTE, and the unemployed, THEY VOTE.|`|BMgIhRLOaa	Laziness is rewarded in the US.

Clinton's welfare reforms put a stop to that years ago. If there is a guy down the street living as you describe, I guarantee you that he has problems you are not aware of. Boo hoo you can't get a car. Be thankful you still have a job. That is more than a lot of Americans have today.|`|y7p8sbazaa	You didn't have health insurence before.  The other guy probably had health insurence before but lost it.  Because he USED to have health insurence, the hospital had files still on record of him, so they covered it.  Since they had no files on you, they didn't.<br>  <br>  The law is retarted sometimes, but looks like you got screwed over man, sorry|`|YCtvI9eqaa	I absolutly feel you!

He's causing inflation, by printing money we dont have. By the time he's done, you'll need a wheelbarrow to take your cash to the grocery store, cause those dollars will now only be worth "change"....|`|tyvFUPOxaa	I thought your Greedy Old Party couldn't wait to plunder and pillage the American taxpayers... You highly esteemed CEO's and Bankers must be nervous with your anticipation of counting your shares of the loot from the taxpayers again...

People wouldn't want gold then. they would want basic necessities like food and water.  anyway, to answer the question, it wouldn't be such a great idea.  even though the federal reserve basically does this for banks, it would be even worse if they did it for the general population.  If you're so concerned about paper money, sell your gold and buy a book on edible plants and a book on bartering.  i'm not even joking.|`|oNATwfvcaa	I'm with you.  More liberal insanity.  Spending your way out of debt is another example of  anti-logic from liberals.  This country voted in a liberal socialist and now we (even though I didn't vote for him) all have to suffer.

He promised to appoint an ethical cabinet, and then he went and appointed former Clinton aids with a laundry list of tax evasion charges and morally ambiguous records. No, this isn’t transparency in government, it’s a shell game of slight of hand, as long as he keeps moving, he hopes we’ll never see what he’s up to.|`|ZhZOckPPaa	NO! He was more transparent during his run for president, back in 2001 he basically reject our constitution, which protects our rights, people need to listen to him rather than hear him, he speaks a good speech but most do not break it down to see what he means by what he say's, When people think that it's good to have control of there life is when the people will fall.|`|XBvx1FDDaa	They have been as transparent as a brick wall.<br>  <br>  Hope and change, hell we better hope they change what they have been doing.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Yes, they've made every flip-flop and lie public.

bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	Rush hasn't taken over the Republican party, that is ridiculous to claim.  If you bothered to listen to the ENTIRE tape of what he said - you would know this.  NO, I have never listened to Rush and I don't plan on it either, BUT I did look into the claims, and they are false - it is easy to come to the conclusion based on REAL facts and truth.<br>  <br>  The Religious right?  Those that are Religious are still here and your idea that they are going away or anything ridiculous as that, is very far fetched.  <br>  <br>  Admittedly, the Republican party has to do some work in getting their act together - however - your accusations are nothing but lies.<br>  <br>  On the other hand - the Democratic Party needs to get off of their Power grab before they destroy this Country.  It IS happening, you just make a choice close your eyes to it for the sake of defending someone you think to be so great - he is human, not a miracle worker (yes, Obama) and his ideas are gonna drive us to collapse as a Country.  Care about your Country, not a single individual that has become an icon and star, rather than a leader!|`|1CCeJ6pgaa	no one has to apologize to rush. the fact is that he has endorsed micheal steele at times in the past, and they share the basic same points of view so mr.steele realized he'd messed up and wanted to take responsibility for it. i know that is a foreign idea to those on the left, doing what is the right thing.|`|T2zD3FS6aa	You must be out of the loop. Rush being the leader of the party were yesterday's talking points. They have no relevance today. Today he is just a talk show host with so much hubris that he wants to debate the president.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	Only Dems have made the assertion that Rush is the leader. If it suits you...stick with it. It's a distraction from what's really going on and you are falling for it.|`|sdvJXMRqaa	The "religious right" was going downhill way before Limbaugh took over. <br>  Ted Haggard ring a bell or that Focus of the Family idiot?|`|9PAavWnyaa	He hasn't. You have fallen victim to the propaganda of the left and the liberal media, my friend.|`|SS1VReF0aa	And we continue to focus our attention on Rush, a talk radio host...instead of on what really matters right now. Good job!|`|B6c7BeDnaa	their praying for you .|`|PPKuHl9baa	Oh how you do fall victim to the far left masking Obama's economic restructuring of power with these silly, but well orchestrated, slander stories of Rush Limbaugh. A purposely enacted smear campaign to hide the obvious. Your mind is feeble indeed.|`|nYjVW8Fbaa	oxicotton, i don't think i spelled it right, but i think you know what i mean|`|2oO36b0maa	Rush has taken over?  When?  News to me.|`|11dGXLchaa	Rush is not in charge of the Republican party.   That's just propaganda from Obama.    Instead of trying to work with Republicans, Obama is trying to stir public sentiment against them.|`|ywOqliwKaa	We are here. Stronger than ever. Waiting to see if Obama keeps his promises and stops lying.<br>  <br>  Rush is just a conservative radio talk show host. He has little to do with the party. If you focus on him, you will not hear the silent majority that really matters.<br>  <br>  Remember, 47% of the people voted against Obama, even with all the media and hollywood supporting him. He had better not piss us off!|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	They went the way of other powerful groups; like "the vast Right Wing conspiracy".<br>  <br>  They are buying guns and stocking up on ammo, preparing for the total chaos that is just around the corner.|`|gau0w8LMaa	Hey Carville tell Rom you are hurting your own cause.

08c47ade809f8810ef2b21fa9304d450aa	I doubt it.  It's like saying should Congress ever be free of corruption.  Slanting and distorting the news is so embedded in their culture now.  Thankfully, they no longer have a monopoly on news and there are unbiased sources out there (which is why their ratings continue to plummet along with their credibility).|`|dfxfeWVMaa	I dunno what news you watch but CBS and ABC are not in the tank with Obama.

t3QAaSN9aa	No.  Your defense of Gingrich is rather amusing.  Gingrich fought Clinton tooth and nail on almost every aspect of policy.  By contrast, Pelosi appears to have been extremely cordial to Bush and some would argue too much so. <br>  <br>  I think Republicans are upset because Pelosi is actually doing her job.  It is of course distasteful to Republicans when they don't have power and when they can't ride roughshod over the Democrats, as they did in the past.  Too bad.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	If you do a little research you will find that she is VERY partisan and despises Republicans.<br>  <br>  I think she is a danger to your country.

1oxBCtmZaa	It doesn't work - it's the "broken window" fallacy.|`|oBL3AtRfaa	That's not creating a job. That is consumption of already-existing services. It produces nothing new that didn't exist before  for me to sell to the public. It's like buying a can of tuna fish for me. It might be a different story if I owned a spa and HIRED someone whose services would be paid for by willing customers. Otherwise instead of just ME living on my salary, it would be me and the masseuse living on my salary. There is nothing new produced.<br>  <br>  I happen to think rodeo museums are stupid too. But there may be a great many people who would be interested in going to one. And construction jobs are created at least for a while. And there is something left over to sell as a result: the experience of visiting a rodeo museum, which people will be able to take advantage of for years to come. There are gift shop employees, guards, curators and accountants it will employ.|`|3c7af99d45cd29de4b5830261c158f92aa	The market is the only one who can create real jobs. Whatever the market wants in products and services has to be provided by someone working.<br>  Jobs created by government intervention waste resources and increase the cost for the market because the ones who have real jobs are the ones who produce real resources. The government jobs produce things that are not wanted in the market and have no value, provide services that are not wanted in the market and have no value.<br>  Taking X amount of money OUT of the market prevents the market from creating new real jobs. Throwing that money back IN to the market to create fake jobs makes no sense at all. Add to that the fact that OUT is a lot bigger than IN due to the government lack of efficiency to do anything.<br>  <br>  Resources can't be created by law. Here's a simple simile to understand the plan. You are running out of water, your glass is almost empty, so you take whatever is left, carry it in your hands (dripping all over the place), turn around, go back and forth, and pour it back into the glass. You were active all the time, nobody can blame you for being lazy, you took immediate action to solve the problem, nobody can blame you for not reacting, you poured water into the glass, nobody can blame you for not adding to the solution of the problem. But overall, you're far worse than when you begun.|`|8diTOnNiaa	you have to stay within your means

It was a clarification. <br>  <br>  There was no need for an apology. <br>  <br>  The left twisted Steele's words, took them out of context, and blew them out of proportion in order to create conflict where non existed.<br>  <br>  The left is becoming desperately juvenile.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	I disagree.  It takes a big man to admit he was wrong.  When Steele chose to attack Rush Limbaugh he was wrong.  He apologized and now the Republican agenda is a bit better defined.

The government will bail them out no matter what the cost, because of the job losses, but of far greater importance, the psychological impact of having an American institution like GM go under.<br>  <br>  One of the most difficult aspects of economics is that it isn't just a question of dollars and cents; a great deal of upturns or downturns can be explained by what people "believe" to be the case. That's why economists measure "Consumer Confidence Ratios."<br>  <br>  That being the case, the government will do whatever it takes to prevent this psychological trauma from setting in.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

The media has not helped much either.  They reported doom and gloom for much of the last few years, and sure enough, there goes the economy.

If Obama inherited this recession, then he better look at his own party also because they were in control of congress from 2006 until present. The economy didn't start going down until 2007. Besides, Obama asked for this job and knew what it was all about beforehand. So his saying he inherited this economy is just silly. He asked for it.|`|7OQWOaGmaa	You're 1/2 correct, Obama inherited the recession, but not from Bush.  This was inherited because of the lack of regulation that Congress could have taken care of.  Obama is being blamed for his poor judgment in increasing EVERY ONES taxes.  Hope you haven't spent that tax decrease you were promised.  He also promised to eliminate waste in Washington, and in his first 2 months he has spent more than any other President in history.  No earmarks, yea right!!|`|95gEZ22Caa	Cause its Obamas fault   he is the one bailing out now   wink|`|2a9MLpZRaa	In short, Barack Obama wanted to run the country NOW.  That is fine, and it's even fine that he says his way will fix this countries economic and security issues.  But to sit and blame one former President is the same as blaming every former President that came before him.  I live in the belief that there is no way we could have gone straight from Clinton to Obama, just like I live in the belief that if Al Gore had won the election in 2000 that things would be exactly where they are right now.

Blaming one side is complete folly because there is plenty of evidence to implicate the other side.<br>  <br>  What I can do is speak out though if I think Obama (well Pelosi and Reid really, I actually think they have more blame than Obama does) isn't doing the right things.

xSdnsSojaa	I don't know that I'd consider Clinton a great president. He was certainly far better than his successor, but he made his share of bonehead mistakes. <br>  <br>  As for Obama, it's really too early to make any sort of call. He's young and inexperienced, but so were Kennedy and Teddy R., and they did OK. He could turn out to be great, he could be mediocre, or he could be worse than Bush, but after only a month on the job, any judgment regarding that is a bit premature.<br>  <br>  What I don't understand is all these braying jackasses with double  digit IQs and no clue about anything who think Clinton was so terrible and Bush was the greatest thing since sliced bread. I guess they must think lost jobs and huge deficits are a *good* thing.....<br>  <br>  .... oh, but wait .... silly me. That's all Clinton's fault, isn't it? ;-)|`|cdfaf090d61b4780b0e9991dfb477d46aa	Well Clinton didnt raise spending very much.  He kept things somewhat balanced by cutting military spending mostly which of course left us in the situation of not having the proper gear available in afgh and iraq, but thats another story.<br>  Obama's budget is a more than 16% increase over this years spending budget. A 500 billion dollar increase. Thats larger than any increase Clinton did and larger than any increase Bush did also.

Does a bank really ask if you can afford that SUV? The bank does not care. Even soccer camps want lots of money for their product and we have to pay it because it is for our kids. All this has to change. Call it Fairism not socialism. Consumers are charged too much for basic necessities. That is why the system is collasping. Obama will lead us to a better system where the poor and middle class are not debt slaves to banks and cc companies.

So, I think that every time a group screams loud enough, they get what they want today. These people are just walking around blind. The only reason they voted in Obama, was because they thought they wouldn't have to pay their bills any more.  If you don't agree with them, they put you down.

6OLiuM9Gaa	Whatever for? <br>  <br>  This probably isn't the answer you're looking for... but...<br>  <br>  Any martial art will do. But you'll find out that, if you're cool, you won't become a "tough guy," you won't swagger around school, you won't kick the poop out of bigger guys. And, if you're smart, you won't go around looking for trouble.<br>  <br>  When I was in elementary school I got picked on a lot because I didn't fight... didn't know how... didn't care to learn how. One day a guy took me on and beat the stuffing out of me. I imposed upon a guy, a mentor of sorts, and he taught me some moves. It wasn't a karate class, jujitsu, or anything formal. Not long after, the same guy picked on me again. This time I got him on his back -- I was sitting on his chest and his arms were pinned under him. I took his ears in my hands and said, "I could bash your skull open on the sidewalk if I wanted to... but I'm not going to. I'm going to give up and walk away." And I did. He jumped me from behind and kicked the stuffing out of me... again. Not long after that he picked on me again. This time there were no witnesses. He pulled a knife. I kicked him in the groin and, while he was lying on the sidewalk, I told him to leave me alone. Nobody picked on me again... even through high school. <br>  <br>  I dated a girl at a University near where I lived. There was a guy attacking girls in the dorms. She asked me if she could call me if she were attacked. I asked her why. By the time I got there (it was about a 20-minute drive) it would be too late. Besides, she could do the same thing I'd do.<br>  <br>  Is it fair? When your personal safety is on the line... absolutely. Don't kid yourself. Then it becomes a question of, "Who would I rather be able to walk away from this encounter?" And, when you're in that situation, it's no longer play... it's serious. Had that guy in elementary school tried to fight with me without the knife in elementary school, either one of us might have won -- just as before. Yeah, I had learned how to fight a little, but I didn't want to, and he did... and he was a couple inches taller than I was. But with the knife, he changed it from a game to something serious.<br>  <br>  In high school I got a growth spurt and shot up to 6'2". I was still kind of wimpy. I could wrestle a little, run a little, and swim reasonably well. But, since I wasn't outstanding in anything... I remained a nerd. Then, in college I found swimming was my strong suit and lettered my senior year, 11th in the State for the 1650. Doesn't mean I was super fast. It only means that in a field of 12, one was slower than I was... I was just too dumb to quit... but it was a state meet...<br>  <br>  Then I joined the Navy. That was in 1960. I was 20 and had a BA in math. My specialty found me in Boot Camp. It capitalized on my swimming abilities. No, it wasn't SEAL... they wouldn't exist for another two or three years.<br>  <br>  A guy I know used to teach martial arts. He's kind of a "little" guy. He's about 5'8" and can't weigh over 150. Since he got out of the service, he wears his hair a little long and has a mustache. He looks like a real wimp. For a while after he got out, he worked as a bouncer. Guys -- usually drunks -- would try to give him a hard time and he'd smile and say, "Pal, you REALLY don't want to go there."<br>  <br>  Here' the deal. Doesn't make any difference how good you think you are, there's always somebody better. The good guys avoid conflict because they know what the dumb ones don't. The dumb guys go out looking for it... and wind up in the hospital... or in the morgue. You get a reputation for being "tough" every moron with a similar delusion wants to find out how "tough" you really are.<br>  <br>  Point is, you really don't have to "Navy SEAL type hand to hand combat." All you really need to know is a few simple moves. Practice them until they're part of you. And then pray you never have to use them -- because if you do have to use them, you're not playing... you're surviving.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	I am sure somebody has made a NAVY SEAL EXTREME FIGHTING DVD.  That should make you elite.  Try www.amazon.com.|`|mRgiBvzUaa	My boyfriend is ex SEAL. He was in for 12 years. He's taught me a few moves. He hasn't taught me formally or anything like that, just enough to protect myself. I don't know if the style even has a name. When he gets home I'll ask him to post. But what he has taught me is almost exactly what gugliamo00 said. <br>  <br>  I'm only about 5'8" tall, but I feel certain that I can take care of myself. As that poster said, I do my best to avoid potentially dangerous situations. But, if there are two or fewer attackers, and if they're not armed, I'll probably be the one leaving under my own power. And you can bet I'll be running.<br>  <br>  ------ More ------<br>  <br>  Ok, sorry about that. I asked my guy to read your question. He did, laughed, read my post, then gugliamo00's post, gave me an "atta girl" kiss, read a few other posts, shook his head and walked out.|`|JuFAyI6Faa	krav maga is what the seals use.<br>  mostly.....then after that is like regular punching and ****.<br>  like muay thai|`|r3vW3zU1aa	go to an army/navy surplus store, they sell books that teach hand to hand combat amongst other types that they teach in the navy|`|ILgk3OLOaa	Rex Kwon Do.|`|WdN3m1tEaa	Places will be hard to find, Navy does not use outside sources to train SEAL candidates like Police do.

If a nurse asked if she could pray for me I'd think my time was up and what does she know that I dont.  It could be very worrying, although a suspension was harsh and it should have been delt with by a warning,<br>  <br>  It would be comparable to the BA instance if indeed BA was a public company which it isn't and hadn't backed down to accommodated the employee.<br>  <br>  <br>  In the case of BA she wasn't suspended for wearing a crucifix it was for having it on display which breached the rules, BA later backed down and allowed staff to display religious jewellery but Nadia Eweida continued to pursue a claim against religious discrimination which she subsequently lost.

This is a derogatory view on men - it implies that all men are potential rapists and invites sex discrimination.

And who pays for that? Isn't it paid for by other health insurance subscribers and/or the municipal/state/federal governments. Those costs just don't disappear into thin air.<br>  <br>  I don't know what Obama's health care plans are universal or otherwise. At a minimum, I hope that the fifty states are given the legal right to offer their own health insurance plans to the residents of their states and to join other states in a multi-state health care consortium.<br>  <br>  For example, I think a New England Compact would offer that region's considerable health and medical expertise to the residents of six states for a price that would be far less than what those consumers pay today. Savings would go right into the pockets of these consumers, and it would cost these state governments less to subsidize health care insurance coverage for low-income residents.<br>  <br>  What would be wrong with that? Health insurance coverage is a reality. It is a non-negotiable necessity. There is tremendous waste in the health insurance sector with billions of dollars are spent for no correlating health benefit while hospitals compete relentlessly and irrationally for market share which adds even more unnecessary costs and expenses to the total health care bill. <br>  <br>  It only makes sense to fight back with the leverage of the state and/or federal government particularly since the cost of American health care has become a matter of global economic competitiveness. There is no good reason why I should be denied a choice to purchase a non-profit health insurance product that I feel is in my best interests. I should not be forced to support a for profit health care system that is not in my best interest. <br>  <br>  I want a choice greater than the choice I enjoy today.|`|tDZMJue9aa	cause he has no boss he is the boss or so he thinks perhaps he is hearing it from all the women he is surrounded by, that he is the greatest and can do no wrong|`|hTFalwX6aa	YES<br>  <br>  Obama is dangerous for America.

But when you pick and choose who to fire to drive a political agenda, part way through your term, that's crossing the line. That's why Clinton's big sweep was nothing but Bush's 8 was. I'm probably wasting my time pointing that out though.|`|93HyAM60aa	You mean like Bill 'I didn't inhale - or have sex with that woman' Clinton did? Nah.

I would need a terabyte of memory to write that doctoral thesis.<br>  <br>  Federation of Earth?|`|GL240ih0aa	Greatest con to the U.S. constitution is that it did not state clearly enough. Who can and should have the power to create, print and issue currency. It is because of that one bit that we are in this economic mess today. Because the Federal Reserve which issues the money is privately owned and unaffiliated with this government, so it loans out money to the government at interest. This is what causes your government to be in a constant string of debt, that can NEVER be paid off. For, in order for us to pay our current debts, we are forced to borrow more money from the federal reserve. If the government were the issuer of its own money, then there would be no debt. Unfortunately the federal reserve system was cheated into our government and remains there this day, slowly deteriorating our economy until the final crash, which is most likely what we're all seeing now.

Now we say here you go and then punish them by taking it away when they do try to succeed. So why, this looks more like a control thing than a hand up thing.

Unfortunately, 'they' chose to disagree and unless 'we' stop them, it will be you, me and 'we' dying. <br>  <br>  Welcome to the human race where peace is always destroyed by tyrants who seek to dominate those who are not willing to fight.

Do you use it or do you talk to him about peace as he pulls the knife across your mother's throat and moves toward your father. How about now? Still want to talk about peace?

The world markets that use american currency for pay for goods, would experience a hyper inflated surge in prices.  Gas would no longer cost 2 or 3 or 4 dollars but rather 100 dollars a gallon, or a thousand dollars a gallon.

If everyone had a million dollars, then the cost of everything would be a hell of a lot more than it is now.<br>  <br>  One of the major problems with things today is because the euro is so incredibly strong against the dollar.

Whereas trafficking the person or persons are generally taken against his or her will. Smuggling is a lose term that could relate to both items as some people will pay others to smuggle them across the border while kidnapped people can also be smuggled into the country. So smuggling relates to both topics while immigration and trafficking are clearly different.|`|hl0fYeQyaa	The distinction has to do with the will of the individual.<br>  <br>  -Human trafficking is when people are forced to move across borders against their will usually for financial gain.<br>  Think of a slave trade as an example.<br>  <br>  -Human smuggling is when someone wants to willingly move across a border illegally and solicits help from a person or organization.<br>  <br>  -Illegal immigration is when a person willingly moves across a border themselves illegally.<br>  <br>  Although the media many times gets these words confused...Just keep in mind that the difference has to do with the will of the person. If he/she is being forced acrossed borders and money is exchanged, it is human trafficking. If the person is willingly moving, it is smuggling.|`|KkjOXRRWaa	One is trading people (as property), one is people moving to a country without legal acceptance and smuggling is one person helping another get into a country without the country's acceptance.|`|tLBjsrEFaa	its the same different name<br>  <br>  although Illegal Immigration could just mean coming over on your own

The prohibition is the law even if the Justice ministry has passed requirements to prosecutors not to jail someone for tiny amounts considered as for personal use.<br>  <br>  But in practice, the French law system is so harsh that it has even be condemned recently in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.<br>  <br>  The reason is as follow: the use of illicit drugs (of any nature) is a minor offense, up to 1 year in jail -- "minor", a question of speaking... --, while possession and trafic can lead to 20 years sentences, even life sentences -- according to the new Penal Code of 1994. But it happens that someone that is caught with tiny amounts of cannabis can easily prosecuted under the term of "detention of illicit drug with intent to trafficking by way of networked crime". And the Penal Code says that under this charge the police can keep you in custody for 4 days. Usually for a common crime even serious one the custody is fixed at 1 or 2 days. So the police have the power to impose this 4 days of custody (without the presence of their lawyer) for the possession of cannabis for personal use.<br>  <br>  Says a French lawyer, Francis CABALLERO, that fights the prohibition for more than 20 years in France:<br>  <br>    "A basic cannabis smoker can have his civil rights fouled, considered as a narco-trafficking criminal and be subject to police intimidation for 4 days without seeing a lawyer, while someone convicted for child pornography will have only a 24-hours custody with the right to see his lawyer after the 20th hour. That's how France is dealing with soft drugs."|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Because we already have an obesity problem and weed will just give people the "munchies" and just make people even more obese lol|`|AA11570236	Yes it's illegal,because of the affects it has on people.|`|dCewrtXaaa	Haven't you heard?

I moved to California from Florida which is completely different, in Florida all they try to do all day is bust people for pot. A bill was just presented in California this month by a lawmaker which is proposing that they make it legal to end California's debt, so it may be officially legal in California soon enough and with Obama as president, the DEA will not have the authority to ignore state laws and they will not be able to arrest people like they are doing now. The cops dont arrest people in California with pot, but the DEA goes in there and arrests people with prescriptions and raids the places we get the prescriptions from because its legal by state law, but not legal by country law, its such crap.<br>  <br>  Here's the facts, last year our country spent 12 billion dollars to arrest and incarcerate people for marijuana charges.<br>  <br>  There are 138 million taxpayers....<br>  <br>  So each tax payer has to pay $315 this tax season for those marijuana crimes. I realize not every single person pays the same amount of taxes, and the wealthy will be paying for most of that, but still, its costing everybody one way or another since everybody throws their tax money in the same place, known as the government.

Large knives may be carried by persons whose vocation (chefs, tradesmen) or leisure activity (fishing, shooting) requires the use of such but in such cases the scenario must be demonstrable ie. on your way to work or to partake in said leisure activity. Any scenario is to be judged on its merits, one does not take a 14" parang in order to cut fish bait, nor does any carrier need to have immediate access to said knife while in a public place. <br>  The only exception is blades 3"(76mm) or less that can be folded into the knife's handle, locking blades are classed as fixed and do not fall under this category. Such knives are deemed to fulfil any reasonable casual useage; trimming nails, peeling fruit, sharpening pencils etc. <br>  <br>  Self defence is no defence and is not legally sustainable. You carry a knife to level the tables with a stronger opponent but in this scenario they're just as likely to overwhelm, disarm & stab you for your trouble - best just take a regular hiding...|`|NyQjxmydaa	The badge of a coward<br>  all knife carriers should be given 5 years without parole,<br>  all those caught a second time ten years<br>  all those carrying a gun 10 years hard labour<br>  for using either a minimum of 20 years hard labour<br>  causing death by manslaughter 30 years hard labour<br>  murder life at hard labour, or bring back hanging,<br>  <br>  no prisons no prison staff no money, and no politicians with the ba-ls to carry it out, just a few human right socialites that have nothing better to do than cuddle the bad guy.|`|6jW5L3Vqaa	Yep, your right.<br>  <br>  If you choose to carry a weapon out on the streets, then you've already decided that you'll use that weapon if you need to - otherwise you wouldn't have taken it.<br>  <br>  A lot of people claim that they need to carry weapons though, and that they'd only use them in self-defence.

They normally will carry them with them to and from work, but they also normally would leave them home otherwise. <br>  <br>  As for a knife or blade, I don't really see a reason either. Some men sometimes like to carry one around to show that they are a bada** or they are cool. They are just looking for trouble at the expense of their own ego. <br>  <br>  On the other side of the coin, there are some women that may carry one for their own personal safety. Perhaps they were assaulted or raped at one time. They would feel justified and safer in carrying some kind of a weapon. <br>  <br>  Technically, in some states, it is unlawful to carry a knife/blade over 'so' many inches in public. They are at risk if they ever get stopped by a cop or searched for some reason of going to jail for it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. :-D|`|TRLsiqZOaa	The question isn't whether or not you have a justifiable reason to carry a weapon, but who else out there is carrying one. And, of course, the next step that seems logical to many people is to simply ban all weapons carte blanche. No weapons, no injuries, right? True, assuming that no one is going to break the law and carry one any way. Does that happen often? Do people frequently break laws? Simply take a very good look at our over crowded jails and prisons. Actually find current statistics online. The numbers are staggering. <br>  <br>  Outlawing all weapons will not stop criminals from carrying them, because if they truly are a criminal, i.e. committing crimes, i.e. breaking laws, then it's just another law, which they have illustrated no regard for by breaking the laws that classified them as criminals in the first place. If weapons are outlawed, then outlaws will continue to carry weapons.<br>  <br>  Enforcing such a law effectively is something unattainable. The sheer financial costs for the additional training of current law enforcement personnel, as well as the cost of the new personnel that will be required to enforce such a wide sweeping ban, their training, new equipment in every building and junction in the city, such as metal detectors and closed circuit television cameras, would bankrupt the city. In addition, every citizen, including you, the non-weapon carrying, law abiding citizen, young or old, black or white, man or woman, would have to be stopped and searched at every juncture, to ensure that you were in fact the person you claim to be, and that you have no illegal items a.k.a. contraband on you. Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, both governments no longer in existence, are two prime examples of the consequences of such a society.<br>  <br>  I specifically aimed my wording towards an argument of removing the right carrying weapons in public, because you have erroneously classified any and all knives (a blade with a handle) as weapons. This simply is not the case. Do yourself a service and do some serious research on the history of the blade, and take a good hard look at non-weapon uses. <br>  <br>  The layperson may find many uses for knives. For instance, I am not a carpenter by trade (ironically enough, I work in the private sector of law enforcement), but I was able to repair a door's latch mechanism by using a folding pocket knife to remove excess wood from a door jamb. Had I not had access to a knife, that door would still be uncloseable. <br>  <br>  I'm not going to list legitimate reasons to carry a knife... I'll leave that to the other Yahoo! Answers users. But I will pose a question to you, and the rest of the Yahoo! community. If a new, sharpened #2 pencil is inserted into a human being's ear, and forcefully pushed into the victim's head, it will cause death. Are pencils weapons? Or are they tools used in a malicious way? If we need to ban all knives, then we need to ban all pencils, pens, and drinking straws as well. Absurd. <br>  <br>  I'm glad that your question was worded in a way that it didn't address knives specifically, but was more aimed at discussing a particular weapon, and by extension, all weapons. The alleged right to bare arms is something that is always hotly debated, and after the recent U.S. presidential election, is a very hot topic in the U.S. (President Obama is said to favor banning fire arms, but please, don't take my word for it, look it up.)<br>  <br>  If I were a criminal, I'd feel a lot safer about breaking into the home of an unarmed person, or mugging an unarmed person, than I would feel about robbing or mugging people who carry guns. <br>  <br>  Challenging your government, it's rules and laws, and the rules, laws and actions of society itself, is the foundation of any good democracy and the civic duty of every citizen. But whatever side you're on, make sure that your arguments are sound and well researched, and always assume that no one is so smart that they cannot be wrong. You illustrated this fault by stating an answer to your own question:<br>  <br>   "What possible justifiable reason is there to carry a knife/blade in public?<br>  There isn't, not unless you intend to injure/kill somebody with that weapon. "<br>  <br>  It shows that you have already closed your mind to the possibility that your ill conceived notions of what a weapon is and whom may posses them may be incorrect. This is not the way to have a debate, or even ask a question.|`|4O0QNtk1aa	well for myself i dont carry a weapon however there is a tonne of weapons on the streets, mostly knives are most dangerous but if you pay attention the the different types of assault those who want to carry a weapon for defence often use improvised weaponry like steel tipped umbrellas, stanley knife key rings ect ect. there are acctualy plenty of legitimate reasons to carry a knife, however as a blade there are les but just as legitimate, if yuo carry a knife your prepared to use it, that makes sence however u could want to use it in self defence, a granny carrying a knife is still a knife weilding person, just as dangerous.<br>  <br>  but basicly a weapon is both attack and defence in one, most would carry to deffend but when two knifes are draw only one can walk away. i prefer running myself =]   [dont learn judo for self defence learn parcore :spelled wrong:]|`|BrlEO0Exaa	well what if you are going fishing, or camping?

I don't use every tool, every day, but most of them come in handy quite often. I try not to use the knife blade on this so that I always have a razor sharp blade if I damage or forget my main knife(ves).<br>  <br>  Then, if I'm not at work (I use bigger, stronger knives for work), I'll carry a Spyderco UKPK and/or another Swiss Army Knife. The UKPK is my main knife; the one I use to open packages and all the other day-to-day tasks. If there's a particularly hard/dirty task to be done I'll try using one of the tools on the Swiss Army Knife and because they're so cheap and easy to sharpen, I don't mind damaging the blade as it's easy to repair/replace (the UKPK would cost half a weeks wages to replace if I damaged it!).<br>  <br>  Yeah I probably don't need to carry the UKPK; it doesn't do anything one of my main Swiss Army Knives could happily do... except it has a clothing clip and can be opened and closed with one hand, added to the fact it has a grippier handle and will stay sharp for longer: that makes it much more convenient and safe to use, and since it's perfectly legal for me to have it, why would I chose a less efficient tool just because some people feel it looks 'scary'?<br>  <br>  If you haven't come across a use for a pocketknife lately, you must be a very dependent person. It's perfectly legal for anyone to carry a small pocketknife (non-locking, sub 3" blade) without needing to justify it (yes that's right, the law expects people to have small knives with them; they know that it's normal!) AS LONG AS YOU DON'T INTEND TO USE IT AS A WEAPON.... so why don't you?!<br>  <br>  PS. I also ALWAYS have a torch with me; that may seem excessive to some people, but unlike them, I can't see in the dark! Truth be told, I probably use my torch even more than my knives!
OI30evgSaa	Well this might help<br>  <br>  Viacom is accusing YouTube of “massive intentional copyright infringement”, saying that 160,000 unauthorized Viacom clips have been uploaded onto YouTube, totaling more than 1.5 billion views. In truth, the “more than $1 billion” figure sounds a little low: typically these companies seek the maximum sum of $150,000 per infringement. This was the case with Bolt.com, which decided to settle for $10 million rather than endure a lengthy legal battle against Universal. <br>  So this is the ultimate showdown: a test whether you can “pull a YouTube” and get away with it. YouTube, frankly, has moved the video market forward faster than any other player, and that high risk game is ultimately good for users. If it had been left to Viacom and its ilk to move forward with Internet TV, we’d still be watching everything in Windows Media or Realplayer format, with no progress made over the past two years. These companies didn’t innovate, and suddenly found themselves contending with a young upstart that was driving more viewers to their content than they ever could. Fearing loss of control, particularly of the distribution channel, suing seemed like the best option for a company that’s anti-innovation. That said, YouTube was also so incredibly slow to roll out its copy protection, and only delivered a deal with AudibleMagic when we expected an in-house solution, that it gave these lawsuits the opportunity to bubble up.|`|6b9a8822d984eeabc0465c51421c4bfeaa	Its nothing new...copy-write laws have been around forever.|`|oTmylEGUaa	They don't want you to come up.|`|6dHIoJLVaa	If you are using an image or the likeness thereof of VIACOM's then yes you are in copyright violation.

Only to find out that what they changed made their business worse than what they had to begin with.  <br>  <br>  Some just feel that they need to adopt changes to catch up with the times, meaning they may feel that their system of doing things is antiquated or totally out of date.  <br>  <br>  And some times by changing things they can draw a different age group of people, that can be a good thing for a company as well.  So that their business may then increase their sales production, which brings in more of a profit for their company.  <br>  <br>  Plus change can some times help keep a company fresh and exciting for people, where it will help draw new customers in and keep it stimulating for the old customers.  People get bored easily with the same old same old, and so change can some times be a good thing.  <br>  <br>  It's kind of like grocery stores, when you go into the store and suddenly the items in the store are not in the same place where they use to be.  They make changes so that people will end up in their store longer in hopes that they will buy even more while they are in the store.  While we may not like the changes, they are looking to make more of a profit from us having to shop longer. <br>  <br>  I hope that this helps answer your question.  God bless!|`|xcvuJfKMaa	There could several reasons: 1. New leadership and/or top management, who have a different philosophy and mission for the organization. 2.

It legally doesn't matter whether you're profiting off it or not, you're still copying it without the studio company's permission. Although if you're just distributing it to a couple of friends or family, it's unlikely they will find out about it and they have much bigger pirates to worry about anyway.<br>  <br>  * Copyright infringement CAN be prosecuted as a criminal offense (although criminal prosecution is usually only used against the big commercial piracy rings), and is also actionable in a civil court (typically what's used against P2P file sharers and other "small-time" individuals). But there is no actual provision anywhere allowing exceptions for friends and family, so I don't know where Mister2's getting his information.|`|AA10798839	It is  copyright infringement, but it's not illegal to make copies of music and VCR tapes to give to family and friends. Not sure about CD's DVD's, but odds of getting busted for giving them away is low.
xcvuJfKMaa	You will need to check with your local state unemployment office.  It depends on so many factors: like how long have you worked, and how much money has an employer paid uic for you during your work history and do you have enough paid in, at certain quarters of the year to claim unemployment.  Did you go from fulltime to parttime?  They can let you know, if you are eligible and if you are, how much you would receive.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	I dont think you understand what unemployment is. Its for people that are unemployed. So No since you have a job you cant file for unemployment. The only way you could get it is if your work laid you off right now. and then you would be eligable to file for unemployment from that job but you would only be getting like 60% of what you were actually makinng so maybe like $100 a month. If you need money pick up more hours or find a new job.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	When working part time, you can file a claim for partial unemployment|`|In1UqryNaa	Yes I believe so, if you were fired and picked up the second job afterwards, but make less than what your unemployment is paying you then you can.

AA11376640	if you are now 18 or over challenge the courts jurisdiction on the subject matter yourself, an attorney will get you out of nothing! If know one was injured there is no crime at common law. I beat 3 heavy charges by refusing an attorney and challenging their jurisdiction, I did have to get evaluated by a psychologist to prove that I was competent to defend myself, once I was they dropped all the charges with prejudice. Just by talking to an attorney you waive your rights unknowingly into their jurisdiction! I have been studying law for 12 years it is not that complicated when you keep jurisdiction, and keep your mouth shut until the time is right. Once challenged the court must prove jurisdiction before they can prosecute/persecute. All law is contract law, demand to see the alleged contract subjecting you to their contract law, if they produce one revoke your signature under UCC 1-207 recourse and remedy! My rule of thumb is that if it is a code, ordinance,policy, statute, "C.O.P.S." for short, then it is a contract law and does not apply to me. It is non-positive law, which means that it does not apply to everyone, look some of this stuff up. Only you can judge you, you have exclusive jurisdiction, as long as no injury actually occurred! If a judge ask you about jurisdiction, tell him that jurisdiction is yours, and you do not consent nor surrender it to them! No jurisdiction no case!

AA11206283	Mention anyone you want.<br>  <br>  Stupid if they are going to trash you.|`|kprKXEOSaa	The point of using someone as a reference on a job application, is that your prospective employer will call them and ask them about you, right?  If you don't give the person a heads up, you have no idea what they will say, and if the prospective employer does in fact call them, it may catch them off guard.  It's better to let the person know in advance, so they can be prepared just in case.  I don't think it's illegal, but it is stupid.  <br>  Also, if the person you listed as a reference is just a friend, they probably aren't the best person to list as a reference in the first place.  What are they going to say, "yeah, he's a nice guy, we drank a few beers together."  You should be listing former employers.<br>  I think you're counting on the employer not following up with your references, and that could backfire on you.|`|RRFbDou9aa	Legal? Yes.  A good idea?  Absolutely not.<br>  <br>  You should always check before listing someone as a reference.  Just because you're on good terms with them doesn't mean they think highly of you.  I've had friends ask to list me and I've told them bluntly that they'd be better off listing someone else because my reference wouldn't be a good one.|`|QQsIPlV2aa	Sure it is! Just make sure the person would give you a good reference. But, what I would do, I would contact the person and tell them what you did, cos it was on the spur of the moment and couldn't think of anyone else to write down!|`|AA11376640	Absolutely, if the person doesn't want to give you a good reference they won't!

If you think that, you are mistaken and will be sorely disappointed when the authorities won't allow you to try.<br>  Do you think that obtaining Canadian citizenship will be both easy and instant? I hope not because, once again, immigration won't let you try that stunt either...and, yes, it is a stunt - even if it isn't, immigration officials will see your idea as a stunt.<br>  It sounds like you are just trying to help this friend of yours run away from her mother and, probably, from any rules her mother may have. <br>  <br>  Sorry, but it won't work. <br>  <br>  You state, "...we have enough on her Mom to do this..." Emancipation has nothing to do with anyone except the person who is seeking emancipation. That means it isn't up to you to "get" her emancipated. Reading that, it starts to sound as though she isn't ready or willing to take any responsibility for herself by either applying to become emancipated or to follow rules as set out by her mother. Why does she want to move out of her mother's place? If there is a problem, she needs to work something viable out with her mother instead of trying to rely on someone else to solve her problems for her. If her mother is abusing her then she needs to contact the police. But this running away from her mother and trying to have you fix everything for her is pure BS and the authorities will very quickly sort that out.<br>  <br>  Advice? She needs to get her s#it together and you need to stop trying to solve her problems for her. Be a friend to her, definitely; listen to her when she needs to talk, absolutely; trying to "get" her emancipated, no way, not a chance.<br>  <br>  Sorry if that sounds harsh but that's the way it is.|`|1c2ff0589d655a36a936d6af96fb7116aa	Lets get the simple things out of the way<br>  <br>  1.

The problem lies with those that SHOULD be punished severely and those who SHOULD NOT be punished severely.<br>  <br>  To me the man that murdered a woman is just as bad as the man that sells drugs. <br>  <br>  The reason: The man that murdered the woman did so deliberately, the man that sells the drugs does so deliberately knowing that those drugs could take a life. <br>  <br>  Same goes for drunk drivers, if your drunk and you get into a car to drive yourself somewhere else, you do so knowing that you can cause a fatal accident, <br>  <br>  If a criminal does something that could potentially cause the death of another, that is premeditated.<br>  <br>  Someone stealing food is not in the same league as someone who commits a potentially fatal crime.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  I feel that both the Dr.s AND their patients are responsible. However the Dr's  should be held accountable for the medications that they prescribe. Dr.s dole out pills like no tomorrow. They think nothing of giving you pills and failing to tell you the adverse reactions. They should be made to try other alternatives BEFORE handing out the hard stuff. The hard stuff should be HIGHLY regulated and the Dr.s held accountable for prescribing it before other alternatives are tried.<br>  <br>  Patients are responsible for their own actions, but had it not been for the dr. in the first place they possibly wouldn't be addicted. If other treatment alternatives were tried they very well could have found something that worked that wasn't addictive.<br>  <br>  My best friends step-father was severely injured while at work.

In such a system, rights of the minority cannot be taken away by vote of the majority.<br>  <br>  David L: You have no idea what you're talking about when you write, "The CA Ninth District Court (the most overturned Court in the Nation) overturned the first vote baning "gay marriage"."<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as the "CA Ninth District Court"; it was the California State Supreme Court that overturned the ban on same-sex marriage because they found it in opposition to the California State Constitution.  <br>  <br>  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is "the most overturned court in the nation" (or at least right-wingers say it is, I have no idea if it is or not),  and did not rule on the legality of same sex marriage in California.  The Ninth can only rule on questions of federal law, anyway.<br>  <br>  The fact is that from June 17 to November 5, 2008 same sex couples had the legal right to marry in the state of California.  Thousands of them did, and the bigots behind Prop 8 divorced them.  Why they're so full of hatred I cannot imagine.|`|JwNZ7kK5aa	Prop 8 should never have existed in the first place. If we had a vote to ban Jews from getting married, and over 50% of the population voted for it, it wouldn't happen. The courts would shoot it down in no time. <br>  <br>  Americans don't have the right to vote on everything, especially when it comes to taking away other peoples rights. Otherwise all we have is mob rule and no protection for a minority group.<br>  <br>  So no, it doesn't violate the sanctity of the American vote in any way.|`|YCL50xgnaa	It's unconstitutional.<br>  <br>  People seem to forget, or just don't know, but it's the JOB of the Supreme Court to interpret law, and to make sure laws don't go against the Constitution.  If what a voter votes on is unconstitutional (like in this case, state sponsered discrimination by the majority over a minority), it should be struck down.  That is how our country is set up and how it was intended from the birth of our country.|`|lW2QVnUmaa	I agree.. I am Californian and I voted for it.. Not because I care..

Most small businesses just got a huge tax cut.|`|klj3cOFPaa	Three-quarters of U.S. corporations pay no income tax at all, according to the IRS.  The fact is that it's pretty easy for a business to avoid taxes because there are so many loopholes in the system.  <br>  <br>  You have to get beyond tax rates to know what is really going on with taxes.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  First of all, a "loophole" is not always a deduction.  It's often a credit or some way in which the law provides that income is not treated as income in the first place.  For example, the law permits foreign tax credits, but it was not intended to permit a corporation to open a foreign office merely to increase the ability to obtain foreign tax credits.  (See sections 901 and 901 of the Internal Revenue Code.)  <br>  <br>  Second, a loophole is by definition a tax result that Congress did not intend.  It is not EVERY legal deduction.|`|mBt5VgtHaa	Big deal. In the US, we have had double taxation before and during the boom years of the 1980's and 1990's.

County could create 10,000 temporary jobs with stimulus funds<br>  Supervisor Don Knabe asks staffers to use more than $100 million to subsidize the mostly entry-level jobs, which would be reserved for people on welfare.The new jobs would mostly be entry-level positions and be reserved for people collecting welfare. New employees would tackle the work backlog created by the county's hiring freeze. (The county is now calculating how much work has been left unfinished by the county's remaining workforce of 100,000.) <br>  <br>  "We are trying to ensure that we are not creating busy work. We do have a lot of vacancies in the county that have not been filled," said David Sommers, Knabe's spokesman. <br>  <br>  <br>  The jobs would be available between May and March 2010. <br>  <br>  Knabe said the county would have to scramble to process that many job applicants by spring. Currently, only 700 welfare recipients have passed intermediate clerk exams. <br>  <br>  "If we were able to get 10,000 jobs, could we get them through the system? That's going to be the next battle," Knabe said. If the county takes too long, the funds might go elsewhere, he said. <br>  <br>  Hundreds of millions of dollars in federal stimulus funds are expected to be funneled through the county in the coming months. Medicaid and foster care systems will receive an additional $442 million between now and next year because of new funding formulas, said County Chief Executive William T Fujioka. <br>  <br>  Another $32 million will go to county roads. An $81.5 million grant will benefit homeless prevention and community development programs, among others.<br>  <br>  In a memorandum, Fujioka wrote that the success of the stimulus funding would be "determined by its ultimate effectiveness in improving economic conditions in the State and the County, which, in turn, will affect State and local tax revenues and decrease health, welfare, and other State and County expenditures."<br>  <br>  However, Fujioka cautioned that the federal windfall could be offset by state cuts.<br>  <br>  "The federal government is putting money in our right pocket, but the state may take just as much from our left pocket," he said.|`|bQJzUgiXaa	like shrimp.

Legal immigrants wouldn't need these shelters.  The Church and its Bishops have been very open in pressuring the U.S. government to offer amnesty to illegal aliens.

They just find it's easier to smear his name than debate differing opinions.  Note how they reacted to Sarah Palin.  Smear, smear, smear.  They never ONCE said, "Palin is wrong about this viewpoint and here is why..."  All you heard is "expensive clothes", "hillbilly accent", "look at her husband and daughter", blah, blah, blah.  It's not so much we don't have a right to our views.  We don't have a right to our title.  Liberals would love us if we said, "We're liberal Democrats, and we believe women have a right to have their babies, people have a right to own guns, and we believe in utilizing the death penalty."  Why?  Because all that they heard was "we're liberal Democrats."  <br>  Plus, how could they argue with logic?  Sure, they have before.  But only in the extreme case where they didn't have anything they could smear.  <br>  Lastly DO NOT LET THIS "RUSH LIMBAUGH" CONTROVERSY DISTRACT US FROM WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN ON CAPITAL HILL!!!

Some do, but most do not. It's not that they aren't smart people. It's simply because they moved from high school to college and haven't had a chance to experience the world yet.<br>  <br>  However, some people don't go to college and might get more experience quicker.  Other might join the military right out of high school and get plenty of real life experience as well.  And some colleges do promote policies that improve real experience during a student's college life.<br>  <br>  So as I initially said, it's impossible to find the best voting age.  I do think 18 can be a bit young for most people and the number 18 was thought up back before college was something the majority of people moved on to immediately following high school.  However, I don't think there's any way to come up with enough justification to change the age requirement at this point.|`|QEYFU5Lvaa	If you are old enough to get shipped off to Iraq to die in a pointless war then you are old enough to vote for or against the person that sent you there.|`|X81oLqMtaa	So are you saying that people who graduate from High School and immediately join the military are not qualified to vote?|`|Lc6o6w8Maa	The youth vote is important.

Out of control spending, failure to reign in FM/FM, Acorn enforcing NINJA loans and people in general spending way beyond their means. To say a blanket statement regarding Bush's policies being the cause is a side effect of inablity to see what's in front of your face. That answer almost always screams "I don't know a damn thing, so I'll just follow the crowd and point my finger". When people bother to read what happened in 2006 until now, they see it is a combination of things, and one party isn't to blame. However, now the party that claims to have been perfect in this arena is now in control and doing more damage than what they accuse others of previously doing. Sad day when Americans choose partisanship over facts. It's a useless fight because it is just divisive and offered up as distraction. Wake up people!|`|39KUKALFaa	The reality of Bush is that the economy tanked because he entered a room where the Dems had spilt gasoline all over the floor and on barrels of oil by forcing bankers to lend to uncreditworthy borrowers.<br>  <br>  A clever and sincere man would have turned off the light and locked the door, while working out how to douse the place in water or something better.<br>  <br>  George decided that he did not care, even though he knew about it, because he proposed legislation that the Democrats blocked. It would have gone a long way to solve the problem.<br>  <br>  But bad character will out. He and Cheney were so greedy for Texas and Wyoming that they decided to put the oil price through the roof.<br>  <br>  First, they manipulated the strategic petroleum reserve. Congress had to close that down. They were using it as a price support for Arabian oil.<br>  <br>  Second, they refused to police the Iraqi oil fields, so they never recovered production.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, they kept in place Bush I's ban on the drilling offshore. This was an executive order in addition to the legislative ban.<br>  <br>  Fourthly, they decided that when McCain/Palin was about to win, that they would kill Lehman Brothers to throw Obama the election, because he is against offshore oil drilling. Bush went on television 3 times before the election to tank the economy. He could have waited until after the election and he could have bailed Lehman out. He bailed everyone else out. Lehman had money market funds like bank accounts and this is what killed intermediation by non-banks.<br>  <br>  The sum of all these is that Bush is not only a crook, but the higher oil prices amounted to the straw that broke the camel's back - in this case, people's budgets. People could not afford their mortgages. In prolonging the Iraq War, he is probably capable of being prosecuted for war crimes. I think that he should be as an example of what happens when you put country last.<br>  <br>  But I agree that he did not create the situation, but he tried to take advantage of it and tanked the economy, the GOP, the country and McCain/Palin. He is a miserable sob.|`|K60FfiIfaa	They're partly to blame, for not understanding how risky their new investment instruments were.<br>  <br>  But it's also the government's fault for not regulating them properly.  A regulatory scheme should've been developed to police new investment methods.  Instead, existing regulation was rolled back, and the SEC was allowed to ignore obvious problems.<br>  <br>  This was a bipartisan failure, and much of it was accomplished in a single piece of legislature: The Commodity Futures Modernization Act, pushed through the senate by Senator Phil Gramm and signed by Clinton in 2000 at the end of his term.  This bill not only rolled back regulations that had existed since the Great Depression, it allowed oil to be traded publicly, allowing the huge run up in oil prices and $4/gal gas.<br>  <br>  And of course mortgage lenders deserve the blame too, for lending to people that couldn't possibly repay their loans, instead relying on ever-increasing home values to offset the risks of default.  It was inevitable the home prices would eventually peak and collapse, causing a mortgage meltdown.  Why no one could see this coming--government or in the private banking sector--is beyond me.|`|oojO4WAraa	I feel like they certainly contributed to it.

The supervisors, the shipping and receiving, the human resources, unions...all take money against the cost of the product.<br>  <br>  Taxes and regulations all add to the cost of the product. <br>   <br>  Everything the government does is overhead. <br>  <br>  The cost of everything will go up under Obama meaning hurting not helping. <br>  <br>  But be sure to reward failure and punish success and mention Rush and Bush in every remark.

The answer is simply because to attain power you need someone to hate. When everyone hates someone, and you have a scapegoat that can be blamed for everything that goes wrong, you are blameless for everything. When you cannot be blamed for anything that goes wrong, then everything you do is right, and you are a beloved dictator. The Nazis, if you know your history, are a prime example of this practice.

However, within the next couple of years, providing patience and consistency prevails, we will definitely be able to see a positive transformation being made. Of course people are placing the blame of the after effects on Bush. That's where they belong. These are not false accusations people.

JhC6BvPpaa	It's a difficult answer to give, It's very unfair at the moment - that's for sure and smacks of discrimination when one country has to pay (England and another one does not (Scotland). But I think that everyone should pay at least 'something' for their prescriptions. If it was totally free, then everyone would be asking for stuff that they just would not necessarily need all the time and the NHS bill would be sky high.<br>  <br>  To make it fair, I would suggest that all working people paying standard tax pay ￡3 per prescription, and rising to ￡6 for those in higher tax bands. Unemployed and old folks should remain free, whilst blood sucking foreigners from ANY country outside the UK would get NAFF all. That's what's hurting the NHS most, take them out of the equation and the NHS would work - period.|`|ujIinLzGaa	I can't answer that, because I live in the US.|`|ZU5y3OVVaa	Are you people so naive that you think the Scots and Welsh are getting something for free. It just means those taxes are paid in other ways. Where is all this money to cover these costs coming from. The ￡7.20 does not even come close to paying the true cost of most medication and the reality is that for those who have to have medication frequently you can buy a yearly or quarterly pass.<br>  <br>  For those who complain that they cannot afford ￡7.20 and it should be higher rate tax payers who subsidise them my question is why. I am a higher rate tax payer who worked my way up from the slums of Liverpool by hard work and a lot of my own time and money going into extra education. Why should I pay more for my prescriptions than you do. I already pay more tax.<br>  <br>  If you lived in the States or many other countries around the world you would get no medical treatment unless you paid for it all at full price.|`|LBHQkBnkaa	I live in Wales and I think that I should pay prescription charges. I am hardly ever sick, I almost never get a prescription and I'm in a well paid job. Why should I get free prescriptions when the NHS could use the money for some one who has something seriously wrong with them.<br>  <br>  However, if you have a serious or chronic disease, Diabetes, cancer, HIV etc or you are a student, unemployed, retired or disabled then prescriptions should be free.|`|NnY1wG11aa	If we the English still have to pay for our prescriptions where does the money go, is it just spent in England or is it divided up proportionally  into the rest of the UK.<br>  <br>  But no i don't think we in England should pay no British National should pay come to that and if that's not possible on cost, link it to a percentage of NMW say a quarter or even less.|`|ab37b6bdb0bbbf15c8bbba9c3715bb8faa	So much for Brown the Clown's United Kingdom !|`|RYQ3i0ZNaa	I certainly don't think they should raise the charges!<br>  <br>  At first I wanted to say no, we should not pay. However, thinking about it, prescription charges do raise a lot of money for the NHS, and if they stopped the charges, they'd have to raise that money some other way, so it'd just mean tax rises. So I think I'd rather the charges stay, but they don't increase, and they are subsidised for the people who can't afford them - I heard the radio saying that some people skip out on important medication because they can't afford the charged, which is just wrong.<br>  <br>  I suppose, in the scheme of things, we get the vast majority of the NHS for free, so paying ￡10 or whatever it is for a prescription isn't too bad - it's better than having to pay every time you go to the doctors, like they do in other countries.|`|6106bf75a443c7ad47b50d9b2b1cadc6aa	It is outrageous that there should be such differences in the UK. The easiest way to stop this inequality is to sign your prescription as entitled to Free medication . The labour Government would soon find it self in a muddle. If charges has to be levied at all it should evened out in all of the United Kingdom.<br>  The English pay ￡7.20 Per item on a prescription . That is way over the Top . A standard Annual charge for every one who uses the NHS might be Considered . NO Freebees for Foreigners.|`|MQD7bP0Baa	Eventually the charges in England will be nothing and free medication for everyone.

Also, you are not thinking for the consequences of doing nothing. In a normal economy, a few foreclosures is unavoidable and acceptable. However, this is not a normal economy.

But it does just blow my mind on how much spending President Obama is proposing for the coming years. It's completely ridiculous to believe that more government spending is the solution to our economic problems. The only results that will come out of more government spending are higher taxes, higher interest rates, a higher deficit, and poor pissed off country. Every single time the economy gets into trouble liberals believe that government regulation laws (socialism) is the answer to everything. When, in the long run, those same laws cause more problems than they've solved. FDR's new deal dragged the depression on for more years than if he would have just let the economy fix itself. And now Obama's stimulus package, bailouts, and global new deal is going to do nothing drag this recession on further. I just don't understand what goes on in the mind of a liberal. When a recession goes on during a term where conservatives control the government they don't make regulating laws, they don't make government bigger, they preserve the peoples' rights, and they're patient and let the economy fix itself, because it always does.|`|dWH45KTlaa	No because most of his followers are under the age of 25 & have probably not had any responsibilities yet such as being married with children, having a good paying job with benefits or owning a house & having a nice car to drive.<br>  <br>  When I was young & full of ideas I thought it was a great idea for everyone to share & be equal in everything because I had nothing.

dVQdswtTaa	First you need to remember that the military is sworn to stay out of civilian events. <br>  <br>  Second, this is not the same conscript military that served in the time of Nixon. <br>  <br>  Third, the media greatly exaggerates the divide in this country. It sells air time if you scream "OH MY GOD!" instead of a reasoned examination of a situation. Most of us don't have the attention span for it.<br>  <br>  Fourth, the Officer that joined the anti-Obama lawsuit is one man. While I'm sure that service members' opinions run the whole political spectrum, he doesn't represent the entire military any more than the General who once disparaged former President Clinton in a speech.|`|325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	none.  America has a proud, disciplined military dedicated to defending the constitution.  And the country isn't as polarized as it used to be.  A lot of polls that showed 50/50 spilts in opinion right along party lines have become 60/40 and even 70/30 since Obama took office.  There are still differences of opinion, but I think all the noise you're hearing on talk radio and TV right now is just the far right.  Mostly a bunch of old white guys who are realizing that they are going the way of the dinosaurs.  Of course, they are not happy about it.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Very small.  Most members of the military don't care who the president is, they just want to serve their country.<br>  <br>  I don't think there is that much polarization.  I think you hear a few people making a lot of noise, but it's not a lot of people.|`|FpMCFvV5aa	Highly unlikely.  The military put the Constitution first and would therefore defend the government and the racist ex-crackhead Marxist that leads it.|`|IE38olmLaa	Not very much, the military knows that if they attempt this other major world players will attack them, not very likely at all.|`|9rhmeb7raa	Zero! The only banana republic in the U.S. is a chain of clothing stores.|`|3jYxkUV4aa	To make it likely the military would really, really, REALLY have to be drug through the dirt, also, a position that rivals the Commander in Chief would need to exist.<br>  <br>  Thats just my opinion though, it could happen other ways of course.

I guess it also comes to fact that a lot want to blame black people for the drugs being sold and used (even though it doesn't matter what race you are you could be a drug dealer/user) and just how we blame all the mexicans for coming here looking for a better life..

h9SHkkWlaa	It isn't " Corporate Welfare " . I recalled reading previously that Ireland does have one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the world and America has one of the highest.<br>   Additionally; other Countries such as China, Mexico and India offer a cheaper source of labor too. All of the above is one of the primary reasons why so many American businesses have outsourced all or some of their business to other Countries or even moved their entire Corporations to other Countries,<br>  <br>  Obama's plan to increase corporate taxes in America will only magnify this problem.<br>  What Obama fails to comprehend is that when these Corporations move all or part of their business to other Countries........They take American Jobs with them.<br>  <br>  Conversely when American Corporate Tax rates are lower American Corporations are healthier, produce more, expand more and...........require more American workers to fill these needs.<br>  Obama just doesn't get it.|`|oOPhM172aa	It isn't welfare.  Dems ignore facts.<br>  <br>  RLP, but Republicans like us ignore how people pay lower income taxes in the US.<br>  <br>  Someone has to pay for programs... either corporations or individuals.  Should Obama raise taxes on workers to the levels seen in Europe in order to cut corporate taxes?|`|7708f35ffa2cf7f984891812e17158beaa	You leave out the individual tax rates in those countries for the shareholders receiving dividends or salaries from those same corporations overseas, and by doing so create a very false impression.|`|B4O3f8w6aa	That type thinking looks good on paper, but in actuality, after all the loopholes are used, most companies pay way less in taxes.|`|7tj1d2y5aa	Sweetheart, in case you haven't noticed, Europe is currently in a world of hurt.

Because they route all their money through offshore tax havens like the Cayman Islands.<br>  <br>  To understand the amount of taxes that corporations REALLY pay, you have to get beyond the rate that's printed in the IRS brochure.

fpbLkbJzaa	I'm a mild, moderate and law-abiding citizen and must confess I wouldn't be appeased even if Gordon Brown was strung up from a lamp-post with piano-wire, above a bon-fire, whilst we all threw half-bricks at him. I think it would be letting him off rather lightly - for all the harm he's done to the UK. This deceitful toad was never given a mandate for the job by the electorate - he funked the opportunity to have his position ratified - and we'll just have to put up with the pompous oaf until his fat backside is well and truly kicked out of office. <br>  I'd be a little less angry if the lying moron owned up to at least some of his gross blunders - when trying to ape Blair ("I'm an honest sort of guy"....haha) he's only ever confessed to the 10% tax blunder - a ghastly bit of mishandled obfuscation an 11 year-old would be embarrassed about. <br>  I used to work for a bank and participated in devising pay-off deals for senior executives. The Goodwin situation is pretty typical - generous deals to cloak the reality, for the sake of appearances, or even to avoid the individual wreaking revenge (the big boys know where all the skeletons are and can do a lot of harm from outside the tent).  We don't know the full details in Goodwin's case - as a high-flier, he should have had top legal advice to ensure his deal was bullet-proof.  But I wouldn't  be surprised if certain points of detail were neglected and fall foul of Revenue requirements.  He had a reputation for shredding staff - so let's hope (haha) he was as generous with all the staff he got rid of (to improve profits - and his bonuses).<br>  As regards bank bonuses in general, the vast majority are contractual rights and earned for achieving set targets. Those linked to profits won't of course apply in current conditions - the gravy train for the investment bankers is probably over, although quite how this will be achieved is difficult to see.  If a professional footballer can earn ￡5 million pa or a complete a$$hole like Jonathan Ross ￡6 million pa who's to draw up the rules ?<br>  None of the above should be regarded as incitement to riot or any physical harm to Gordon Brown - those references are merely wishful thinking.|`|AA11052660	nope!  no-one cares about the little people.

It is plain to see what is going on and how this will proceed but that doesn't stop them from maintaining blind hope.  Their leaders are not just leaders to them.  They worship them as deities. They really believe they cannot do any wrong.  The Moderates have more sense then this, and they lack the courage to make any call at all.<br>  Consevatives will never accept socialism.  It doesn't matter if the economy finally settles out, it will never reach the great markets under Bush or Reagan. Over 13,000 points on the DOW now down to just above 6,000 and falling.  In 2 years the market will still be a pulling up it's numbers but it won't be nearly as healthy.  Just wait till you see your paycheck and tax witholdings from next year "if there are any jobs for you around then."  It is not the responsability of the producers in this country to care for the incompetent or lazy.  Let the lazy get their meals from charity.  Welfare should be cut back.<br>  If Companies have to lay off 10% of their work forces, why should Government do any different?  Government should have led the way with sweeping tax cuts to take the burdon off the market.  Obama chose to burden the market and the taxpayers with even larger taxes and an enormous debt.

These containers would do it instead of just digging a big hole and burying thousands of people in a mass MUD grave.|`|xhpAiWPvaa	I think they are for the American people just as Im sure that video states didnt watch it but have an opinion already.<br>  There will be a biological attack and they will put people that are sick from it inside to try to contain the virus.<br>  <br>  They can fit like 4 people in each and they are easily stackable.<br>  Make all the survival food you can while you can and have first aid kits and survival gear<br>  <br>  There a lot of things that are real that most people wont recognize because their president or their local news didnt inform them.<br>  <br>  Dont believe anything anyone else says go with your what you feel thats the most important thing|`|XFnHshOMaa	Well it's always healthy to consider the other side of the argument.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://forums.randi.org/archive/index.php/t-118619.html" rel="nofollow">http://forums.randi.org/archive/index.ph...</a>|`|83dcb9a2ce81f753fdaace547612e772aa	These "FEMA coffins" exist solely to give the brain dead and those with an IQ below 90 something to worry about.|`|9851306172d176bf90c2970ca456d866aa	I don't know anything about this specific report.<br>  <br>  But I think that, given the world situation, some type of WMD attack is likely and I hope the government is prepared for any contingency.<br>  <br>  Ask the experts - they would probably be more surprised if our country were not attacked in the next five years than if we were.

7pfCkrCzaa	So, Let's Recap-- 1. The American people elect a black president with a total of 142 days experience as a US Senator from the most politically corrupt state in America whose governor is ousted from office. The President's first official act is to order the close of Gitmo and make sure terrorists civil rights are not violated. (He screwed up!!)2. The U.S. Congress rushes to confirm a black Attorney General, Eric Holder, whose law firm we later find out represents seventeen Gitmo Terrorists. (An honest mistake!)3. The CIA Boss appointee, Leon Panetta has absolutely no experience, has a daughter Linda we find out, who is a true radical anti-American activist and a supporter of all the Anti-American regimes in the western hemisphere. (There were socio-economic factors involved!)4. We got the most corrupt female in America as Secretary of State; bought and paid for. (You can put lipstick on a pig, but it will still have cankles!) 5. We got a Tax Cheat for Treasury Secretary who files his own taxes. (He misspoke!)6. A Commerce Secretary nominee who withdrew due to corruption charges. (Another honest mistake???)7. A Tax cheat nominee for Chief Performance Officer who withdrew under charges. (Hmmm... another screw-up?)8. A Labor Sec'y nominee who withdrew under charges of unethical conduct. (Ok, maybe this person was just plain stupid)9. A Sec'y HHS nominee who withdrew under charges of cheating on his taxes. (I'm running out of excuses for these idiots!!)10. Multiple appointments of former lobbyists after an absolute campaign statement that no lobbyists would be appointed. (Dear God, I need a drink!)And that's just the first three weeks. . . but who's counting?America is being run by the modern-day Three Stooges ~ Barrack, Nancy, and Harry ~ and they are still trying to define stimulus..."it's spending"...The congress passes the $800,000,000,000 (that's $800 billion) pork loaded spending bill where the government gives you a smidgen of your tax dollars ($13 per week) making you feel so good about yourself [stimulated] that you want to run out to Wal-Mart and buy a new Chinese-made HDTV and go home and watch Telemundo!Yee-haw!!! Only in America, what a country...We are lost... Here's the good news though... Obama is taking Air Force One to Denver to sign the stimulus package, wasting as much as 10,000 gallons of fuel.

He is his creation. What I do not agree the most about barrock Obama is that he is for abortion. We fought to free colored men, women, and children from slavery but he fights to kill and "captivate", in a way, young children. Some people may call them things, but did you know that their hearts begin to beat 9 days after conception? All these fact that are hidden from us! And the media just backs up the liberals. Have you noticed that Barrock Obama is beginning to "change" his views to Bush's? Oh yes, he promised change all right. And that is what we are getting.

AA10156377	Well speaking from personal experience, a long distance relationship can work if your willing to put in the work and you see yourself being in a serious relationship with this person. The Army makes it almost impossible to have a long distance relationship because you may have to decide  how serious the relationship is and if you could  marry this person  ( even when your not ready) in order to be around this person. Also in basic training you do not have allot of time to communicate so I recommend writing letters. You are about to experience something very different in your life and making the relationship work takes both parties. If you guys are willing to put in the hard work it can work. I have had both good and bad long distance relationships. The bad relationships were because I was young and needed to experience my own  personal growth or the person I was in a long distance relationship with was not willing to work for the relationship. The good relationship which resorted in marriage has worked out. I was engaged to this person while he was in Iraq and it worked out for us, but it was hard its like re-learning a person when their away for long periods of time. If your not sure your relationship can withstand time cut your losses. Just remember if its meant to be it will and all you can do is put effort into the relationship.......good luck to you in basic training cause its tiring and long.........Army Veteran, military wife....|`|htaxf1jJaa	It is hard in the beginning, but you two will both grow strong from it. Trust me, I went through it with my brother and now my boyfriend as well, and he is also my best friend. My brother was in boot camp for the Marines for 13 weeks and it definitely brought us closer just by writing letters and same with my boyfriend and he's graduating tomorrow from basic. It's going to be tough, but it's gunna be worth it. From a girls point of view, getting a letter from my boyfriend was the best feeling in the world even if it was just half a page long [cause sometimes his were half a page long cause he didn't have much time and other times it was a full page] but it was still an amazing feeling. I finally got a phone call from him 7 weeks into basic and it wasn't a long phone call, but it was about 10 minutes which the feeling was more than words can even explain. You two will grow stronger together from this experience and just try to write her as much as you can and tell her to write you every day or as much as you can cause that's what my boyfriend told me to do.|`|fdb5c39b33371191416634f636fbfa48aa	You signed up<br>  You knew you would be sent around the world<br>  Its a bummer|`|7fe2be85336431aea2beadaf7f5bdd54aa	Being the girl at home, and then the girl in the Armed Forces, it is hard. It will be hard for you because if you tell anyone you have a girlfriend, they will give you ****, and say she is screwing a 'jody'(a name used for women or men at home who may be cheating on you.) It is all used to tear you down and build you back up again. It will also be hard for he because she won't know when she can talk to you, and she has to have her phone on her pretty much at all times. The best thing is to know that you trust each other 100% because if you have one doubt of her doing something with someone else, it will break your heart, and you won't be able to focus on yourself when you need to. Other than that, try to contact her whenever possible, but if it is meant to be, it will make it better if you are away. You get to know more about the person without letting the physical stuff get in the way.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything|`|JDAbWnJraa	With all of the flowery stuff out of the way, take the memories that you have together, tuck them in your pocket and part as friends because it isn't going to work. Agree that the two of you will stay in contact and see where the future leads you, but to think that being committed to each other is going to be enough is a pipe dream. The reality is that they don't work. So instead of risking losing her all together in the inevitable break up, part ways as good friends and you'll always have an opening there to possibly pick up where you left off once things settle down for you. It'll save you both a lot of sad nights and you stand a better chance of ending up with her in the long run. You"ll date and she'll date and that's cool. You don't need to be her first, or her one and only..... just her last...|`|n2oEhdZiaa	Just write a lot.  It's not that hard to get through basic and AIT like that.

PtvGxLONaa	Although Reagan said those things, Reagan did more to INCREASE the powers of the government, than to reduce it. Republicans have not been in touch with their roots for a long time. Republicans have been Big Government supporters since Hoover (Even though I'm a big fan of Hoover) <br>  <br>  The American public fails to do their part to understand the principals of  government Republicanism. Changes occur, when Americans are informed and are in contact with their congressman and senators. By demanding reduction of Federal powers through the persuasion of your vote, your Senators and Congressmen/women will be more inclined to vote according to your demands.<br>  <br>   If Americans threatened to vote out their senators and congressmen/women because of their voting issues, then Congress will be more inclined (be it a Republican majority or Democrat) to check the powers of the Presidency. This fails because too few Americans keep their Representatives in check. <br>  <br>  The American public has more power, than just voting every 2-4 years. If you form a group of voters threaten to vote out your Representative, if they, for example; fail to vote NO on a bill reducing Federal powers, then you will see them change their positions to keep yours and your fellow colleagues votes.|`|reeU4N0eaa	Since when did the junior Commie Kenyan give a rat's furry behind about what the people want.|`|e2facf0a453208536391b6d4d3f72b15aa	The real problem is population, as it grows, so does the government.

I think a lot of our problems comes from the fact that the upper class didn't really care about the quality of life middle and lower class Americans had.  Quality work took a back seat to doing things cheaply.  I have very little sympathy for the wealthiest 5% and what changes to their tax burden they may face.<br>  <br>  Look at the bright side: we'll fix some of the problems before a bloody revolt breaks out, like the French Revolution or the Bolshevik Revolution.

In my opinion you want fast cash, go bust the drug runners running millions at a time, put some of that back into the system ;)<br>  As far as Obama being what everyone thought he would be, I don't think so, but than again I didn't like him from the start.. He just seems to fake, and he wants to do a bunch of stupid **** like releasing terrorists from prison (who hate america mind you) this is just a conflict of interest with me or something? As far as his trillion dollar budget I must say he don't know what he is doing, and who is the 5% gonna be than?

IM30PoPNaa	The rule in the Senate is that a senator (or group) may speak as long as they wish for one turn of debate, unless 60% of senators in attendance vote to end the speech (called cloture), or unless a unanimous consent agreement is already in place to limit debate.<br>  <br>  Filibusters rarely happen; instead, a senator threatens to filibuster and senators have a pretty good sense of whether or not they can get cloture.  If not, the senator can keep the bill from being voted on, merely by threat of filibuster.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think more senators should be called on their threats.  I think they should be forced to filibuster, and their supporters should be forced to sit in the senate in numbers enough to avoid a cloture vote.

We noticed how his favorite 9,000 pork projects were shoved down the throats of taxpayers, tripling the national debt in less than 30 days in office. Wasn't that ND such a hot topic while Bush was in office? We noticed how the self-proclaimed Christian (he is NOT) has denied the religious rights of every medical professional in the country, and how the man who said special interest groups were a thing of the past, has quickly kissed the backside of every one of them that brings immorality to this country up to and including his payback to the mafia kingpins in the auto industry. <br>  <br>  And the saddest part is that you're not the only one who's proud of him.

But the "super rich" can also afford the best lobbyists and lawyers there are, while the "rich" still have to work for a living.  Not to mention that the "super rich" have access to the best accountants and friendly governments so they can shelter huge amounts of their money.  <br>  <br>  Its not fair at all, but its hardly Obama's fault.  The whole system of taxation if f-ed up to start with.  For my two cents, I say abolish the ENTIRE income tax system and move to a use based tax.  That way, the people who are the biggest consumers (ie, corporations, super rich, etc) will pay the most taxes.  And folks like the rest of us; who don't eat out every meal and actually have to WORK to save money, will pay a lot less.  Seems fair to me.

I don't think that Thomas Jefferson was saying that there is to be no religion in schools, because isn't that what is happening in other countries and they are beginning to fall apart? That is called comunism, and I don't think we want that here in the United States.

6OLiuM9Gaa	When I entered (about 50 years ago)... I'm presuming you're talking Navy ("A" School)... it started about two weeks after graduation. Today it think it starts almost immediately... and that you stick around Great Lakes until it does.<br>  <br>  In answer to you second question... the Navy spends quite a bit of money training you for the job you chose before you started the training process. They also feed and shelter you during that training process. The training was your choice. Then, after they've run up the bill for your training, you decide you don't like the job? Used to be that if you washed out of training for your rating, you were sent out to the fleet non-designated - without a rating. If you completed your training, that's what you did for the duration of you contract. My intuition tells me that it's probably the same way... or should be. But the Navy's changed in the last 50 years... you really need to check with a recruiter.<br>  <br>  In another answer recently I made the comment that you can make of your experience whatever you want. There's always going to be something you can complain about... sometimes you don't have to look very hard. You may not always like the tasks to which you're assigned. Sometimes you may not like the people you work for, or with, or who work for you. You can complain about the hours, the working conditions, the pay, the benefits, the accommodations. But that's going to be true no matter where you work... even in the civilian world.<br>  <br>  I remember my first few days in Boot Camp. I remember getting up before the sun and straggling (trying to march) to breakfast. I heard grumbling about the hour, the cold, and the food. Actually, I thought the sunrises in San Diego were beautiful and kind of felt sorry for the poor saps who were still sleeping and missing the show. I also preferred marching in the cool of the day rather than in the heat -- the same guys who complained about the cold also complained about the heat. And the food wasn't mom's cooking, but it wasn't that bad. You can make anything an ordeal or an adventure with just an attitude adjustment.<br>  <br>  I was in for 25 years. From an old squid... it doesn't make any difference if all you're doing is scrubbing toilets. You can grumble about being just another lousy toilet scrubber... or you can try your hardest to be the best toilet scrubber on the planet.<br>  <br>  While I was stationed at the Pentagon, there was this E-5 who did little but stuff envelopes and write reports. Since he had a little time on his hands, he decided to make up a kind of "status board" to show the activity in the areas about which he prepared the reports. The LT in charge of the section liked it and used it to present the report to the Admiral. The Admiral liked it and used it to make his presentation to SECNAV. SECNAV liked it and used it to make his presentation to SECDEF. SECDEF liked it too. and said he wanted the reports from all the branches in that format. Now, while the young man's efforts made more work for the other branches, it made his own chain of command look good. So, rather than grumbling about having to prepare stupid reports, he set the standard for the entire military.|`|ko4cp582aa	you get flown to A school right after boot camp. you graduate boot camp and go like the next day. After you've completed A school that is the job that you will have for a while. the only way to change jobs is to either re-enlist with your contract stating that are going to be retrained in a different job, or if you can get your command to send you to school to change jobs, but good luck with that. Your best bet will be to finish your A school and do your job the best you can until you're able to re-enlist, and that may take a couple years. Then make sure that the recuiter knows what you want and they'll see if there's a school they can get you into, but you may have to wait for a position. and then you will go to that school as Prior Service, but you'll have a new job in the end.|`|kRFHJhaeaa	well that depends on what branch you are in and when your school starts.  i know for the marines that they give you 10 days of manditory leave before you leave for your Combat school.  as soon as you are done with that you go to your "A" school.  see the catch is, you never know when your "A" school will start.  once you get there you have to wait to class up.  that can be anywhere from 2 days to 4 months.  but take Recruiters Assistance.  its the best!!!<br>  <br>  other branchs are kinda the same but minus the combat school.  once you grad from basic or boot camp you go home for a few days then leave for your school.  but class up rate in school depends on the class size and how many instructors they need.<br>  <br>  anymore questions just ask away!!|`|dcZcPtIoaa	It usually starts within a few days, You might even stay at the same base for "A" school.<br>  <br>  YOU are committed for that job, changing (MOS) jobs is next to impossible unless that you are so incompetent that you become a liability in that field.<br>  YOU will have the chance to change(MOS) jobs when you re-enlist.

Currently prisoners treat jail like some sort of holiday, some cells have satellite TV.<br>  <br>  The problem is deeper than capital punishment, it is with society.<br>  Because of the decline of religion in Britain for some people the firm rights and wrongs of yesteryear have been replaced with ideals of do what you think you can get away with. They wont abide by the law because they've got no reaosn to.<br>  <br>  Sadly the way things are in politics at the moment I dont think it's going to change soon. Labour is too soft, their stupid ideals mean that they believe that the poor who commit most of the crime are actually victims as well and treat them like children who dont know what they were doing. They believe in reforming prisoners but have no idea how to do it.<br>  As for Cameron and the Tories, they are on the right track with their social reform idea and obviously understand the problem but Cameron would never support something like Capital Punishment because of the amount of votes it would lose him when he is trying to distance himself from the strong right wingers.<br>  <br>  The other big issue for stopping this kind of stuff is that the police should not be tied down by paperwork and standard procedure and the public should be allowed to fight back in defence without fear of compensation claims and being prosecuted for violence themselves (that means getting rid of those stupid EU rights laws which means).|`|UZKGEXB1aa	it's proven in statistics that capital punishment does not deter crime. Criminals that are going to commit a very serious crime don't think about the consequences. maybe we should ship them to a deserted island instead where they have to climb coconut trees and kill wild boar in order to survive.|`|k8ivyYfaaa	Well, compare the violent crime you have in the UK to that in the USA (relative to population, of course) and ask yourself if it's really needed?<br>  <br>  If America didn't have the 'war on drugs' that we do, prisons would be FAR less crowded, so the incapacitation properties of justice could be fulfilled.  You could lock murderers up for life, as a punishment for taking a life and essentially let them die in prison.<br>  <br>  BUT... unlike all other crimes, murder victims' families can't receive closure and compensation for their loss through incapacitation or civil proceedings; if you steal my TV, I can recoup that money and get a new one.. you can't put a price tag on someones life.  <br>  So the argument is made that only by the state doing to the defendant as was done to the victim is justice and can bring the closure needed.<br>  <br>  Frankly, I don't know that capital punishment has done anything in the US, other than cost the taxpayers more money and bog down the courts.  Of course, if my wife or child was murdered, I might see the subject differently... who knows.
bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	No, more spin and lies from the Obama team.<br>  <br>  While Washington and much of the media routinely crow about a supposed “return to normalcy” in Iraq, the conditions facing the country’s 28 million people remain appalling.<br>  The human toll from nearly six years of US occupation is estimated, according to the most credible surveys, at over one million dead. According to the International Office on Migration, 2.8 million Iraqis are internally displaced persons, forced from their homes by the violence, and another 2.4 million are refugees who fled the country.<br>  Having decimated Iraq’s infrastructure with the “shock and awe” bombardment of March 2003 and more than a decade of punishing economic sanctions that preceded it, Washington has done next to nothing to rebuild the country outside of efforts to reconstitute its security forces as a puppet army of repression. Instead, the so-called reconstruction effort has consisted of a massive looting operation by corporations awarded cost-plus contracts for work that in many cases was never done and in others done so badly as to be worthless.<br>  The result of this corruption and negligence is a continuing social catastrophe for the Iraqi people. According to a recent Oxfam report, the share of Iraqis without access to adequate water supplies rose from 50 percent to 70 percent from the start of the war to 2007.<br>  According to the inspector general’s report, two-thirds of Baghdad’s sewage flows untreated into the city’s rivers and waterways, finding its way into the drinking water. The result is repeated deadly outbreaks of cholera and other diseases.<br>  At least two-thirds of Iraqis are still plagued by inadequate power supplies as a result of the war’s destruction, with frequent and prolonged blackouts making normal economic and domestic life impossible.<br>  The population remains mired in mass unemployment. According to official figures, 18 percent of Iraqis are jobless, with another 10 percent unable to find full-time employment.<br>  The criminal US war in Iraq has not ended with the inauguration of President Barack Obama, and there are growing indications that it will continue even as his administration escalates the war in Afghanistan.<br>  The essential mission of the US troops, whether they number 50,000 or more, will remain the one they were given with the invasion of Iraq nearly six years ago—the neo-colonial subjugation of one of the most oil-rich nations on the planet.<br>  The Obama administration continues to pursue this goal—albeit by somewhat altered means. Its aim, like the Bush administration before it, is to secure a strategic advantage over US imperialism's principal economic rivals in Europe and Asia by establishing hegemony over key energy supplies upon which they depend.<br>  <br>  Liberal supporters of Obama have sought to comfort themselves and deflect criticism by arguing that the 19-month withdrawal plan about to be announced represents only a three-month deviation from the timetable he advanced during the 2008 election campaign, and that he had always included the proposal for the "residual force" remaining in Iraq.<br>  Such legalistic arguments evade the central issue. In election after election—2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008—the American people have been defrauded, denied the right to cast any real vote on the war in Iraq. Time after time, the Democrats have colluded with the Republicans to assure that the act of military aggression that both parties approved and sustained could not be challenged by the electorate. The millions upon millions of voters who wanted an end to the war have been effectively disenfranchised.<br>  This process culminated in the 2008 election itself, in which Obama's capture of the Democratic nomination was unquestionably driven in large measure by his attempt to identify himself with these broad antiwar sentiments and to pillory his principal Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, for her October 2002 vote authorizing the war.<br>  Now Clinton serves as his secretary of state, while Bush's appointee Gates still heads the Pentagon.<br>  The emergence of the Obama administration's policy of continued occupation in Iraq and escalation of the war in Afghanistan and Pakistan only underscores the bankruptcy of the American democratic process. It is impossible under the present two-party system for the voters to exert their influence on war or any other essential question.<br>  Obama's policies are being determined not by the popular hostility to war felt by the millions who voted for him, but by the financial and strategic interests of the America's corporate and financial elite. He has emerged more and more openly as a mouthpiece for finance capital and the military.<br>  The struggle against war cannot be advanced within the confines of the existing political institutions and the two-party monopoly exercised by the banks and big business.|`|CM1dfztQaa	No, and it won't be for some time. If we have our troops simply pack up and leave, we will end up with more enemies than we already have. Pulling out slowly is the way to go, but I think Obama is going overboard.

JhC6BvPpaa	The RAF keep their aircraft for at least 25 years after they are taken into service. I don't know if you've noticed, but the UK is quite poor at the moment and we cannot afford to splash out like we did in the 40's and 50's, and we also have govts both Lab and Tory that consistantly underfund our armed forces. The Typhoon has only just recently come into service, and Tornado variants will be around for a long long time yet, they still work very well and can pack a HUGE punch still, so don't knock it! They only retired the last Jaguar squadron about 2 years ago, and that's been around since the 60's. The F35 JSF was, I understand only going to be a carrier based aircraft when the new Royal Navy carriers are built.<br>  <br>  The next generation fighter is very likely to be pilotless and possibly powered by scramjets - capable of tremendous speeds and are todays 'X-planes', the experts have been predicting this for about 20 years. Like the Predator now, it could be built half the size of any existing fighter, fly faster and take more G than any aircraft that had a crewman. And, when you think about it, flying fighter aircraft is a risky business, so why risk human life when a bot or someone flying it from the ground can do it safely?|`|nW3iJkT5aa	Why do we need fighters<br>  We have never needed one for over 60 yrs for defence purposes<br>  Today they are just very very expensive big boys toys|`|33121fc0c2bea9ea4d671e5e2438e785aa	You have any idea how much it costs to develope a proper fighter?<br>  <br>  As GB is in the EU, it'll buy EU, i.e. Eurofighter, and whatever the EU developes next, unless US developes something better. <br>  <br>  Besides, it's been said that F-35 will be likely the last manned fighters.

dKi2R2oHaa	Britain ruled the waves. England built a strong navy to protect from pirates and repeated invasions. British navy personel were better trained and were rewarded with prize money which help motivation. They had better leaders and were more than capable of destroying far superior fleets.  After the battle of Trafalgar no nation could come close to matching  the Royal Navy until after the first world war.<br>  <br>  Britain had a number of advantages.  Religious freedoms allowed science to develop unhidered by the church and in a more democratic society. Francis bacon and Newton gave britain a lead in scientific understanding.  Britain had plenty of coal and iron, and the organisational ability to construct transport networks for industry. <br>  <br>  Most of Britains colonies were aquired from other nations during wars. Native peoples often preferred British rule as the British motivation was mostly trade and mutual security rather than pilaging resources and religious conversion. Some conquests such as Rhodesia (Zimbawe) and  most importantly India were achieved as private enterprise operations and were never government sactioned. Britain brought education and technology to people, and replaced despotism with some kind of equitable law to places which had no experience of it. <br>  <br>  It was not all good, and it took far longer than it should have done for Britain to act on quashing the slave trade. When Britain did so, it also enforced extending the ban on slavery to other countries. It attacked slave trading centres and slave ships whenever possible.|`|O5KOwhovaa	1- Because we are the rightful rulers of the world.<br>  <br>  2- Yes we do.

I mean there is many ways to get outta the gang life, try moving (if you can) get a good job, if you can.. The one thing the army could get you is outta there, maybe get you a little disipline if ya need some, maybe get you into college if that is an interest of yours (look into the GI bill they have..) also you could live on base, really not paying anything (to my knowledge) and get a monthly check of course, possibly an enlistment bonus or something..

HXIIbVN8aa	It's a 2 way street. Sure, the unions made unreasonable demands regarding both salary and benefits and, even more so regarding work rules, the jobs bank, etc. but, no one forced the automakers to agree to those demands. It was easier, back then, because of booming sales and profits, to go along with the unions and give them what they wanted. Now everyone is paying for that lack of good judgement by the automakers.  <br>  Someone told the union workers, long ago, that they were entitled to live as well as the owners and they believed it and demanded more and more.<br>  That philosophy ( called socialism) spread to the labor movement in general and , consequently, our costs of doing business, in this country, skyrocketed. <br>  This is the same socialist philosophy that the democrats are now espousing where everyone gets the same rewards regardless of work done, risks taken, etc.<br>  It ruined GM and Chrysler and it will ruin the US  unless they are stopped.|`|2bx5l56caa	Its $45 not 70, stop listening to bill o reilly|`|eulMjLtPaa	This is such an old screed.

AA12332649	What you are describing sounds like a work made for hire under the US Copyright Act.  It must fall into one of the various categories if the painter is not an employee.  The US Copyright Office's circular for work made for hire is below.<br>  <br>  If it is not a work made for hire, you must obtain copyright ownership by contract from the original author.  The exclusive right to make copies is enumerated in the US Copyright Act in the second link.<br>  <br>  The section of the code that defines ownership of the painting as being separate from ownership of the painting's copyright is in the third link.<br>  <br>  You can effectively gain copyright over works made for hire by a properly worded contract, and by taking an active role in the production of the work.  If you put the artist on the company payroll, you have a stronger argument for getting the company as the author of the work.  You should contact an IP lawyer if you are interested in gaining the copyrights of commissioned works so that you can get a form contract for your purposes.<br>  <br>  An addendum to the contract could fail due to lack of consideration (you can't get something for nothing).  Also be aware that if the copyright is assigned to you, the copyright holder can terminate the transfer of rights 35 years after the grant.

If it is not spelled out, perhaps an addendum is in order.

3oNcHdgCaa	Absolutely not.<br>  If she had simply said that she refuses to tolerate any loud foul language, that would be legal. But landlords in the U.S. cannot discriminate against tenants on the basis of race, handicap, age, gender, marital status, ethnicity, or religion. She should not have stated any religious preference, and it makes no difference whether or not you have a written lease.<br>  Contact your city's housing bureau and file a complaint, and ask to have her investigated. It's highly possible that anything a tenant does that doesn't seem "Christian" to her might get them kicked out (including practicing a different religion), so somebody needs to make sure that she understands what the laws say about tenant's rights.|`|SSLekPAnaa	Month to month means the least is renewed for a one month period.

If she were actually terminating your lease because you were, say, Buddhist instead of Christian, that might be a problem (I'm not sure if the federal fair housing laws protect religion as well as race or not), but it sounds like she's doing it because someone at your apartment used profane language and she doesn't like that or consider it "christian" behavior.  She's probably within her rights.|`|Cl2VHwVQaa	I would think that she can rent to whomever she wants since she owns the property, however I am sure the ACLU will take your case.

If you pay your rent on time, you don't trash the place and don't disturb your neighbors, I wouldn't think that is a fair reason for kicking a person out, however someone with actual legal experience would probably know for sure if you have a case.|`|hJk9YZrAaa	I'm sure she can ask you to leave at any time with adequate notice.  However, her invocation of religious beliefs/preferences may raise a bit of an issue with fair housing laws.  I would explore that with the local housing authorities.  Bottom line is that you will probably be moving, but she might learn a little something about tolerance and watching her mouth.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	She is not evicting you because you are not christian.

You are pathetic for supporting and wanting to be with such a douche.<br>  <br>  Tell him to stop showing up to drill and eventually they will discharge him.  That way he will never get deployed and I will never have any chance of meeting him.|`|ILgk3OLOaa	Ha ha ha, your name is awesome!  National Guard Fiance, that's just great.

EBw32eQYaa	You have to pass the DLAB with the proper score for Arabic and be able to receive a TS/SCI clearance. If you do, you'll go to Monterey to learn Arabic in a little over a year. Then you'll go to Goodfellow and then you will go to your permanent duty station. You'll usually have to take a short polygraph when you get there. <br>  Then you will be working. It's a hard job but that's why we get paid up to a grand extra a month.
AA11206283	You do understand the he "PAYS" child support?<br>  <br>  If he is in jail, he has no INCOME: he's paying NOTHING.<br>  <br>  Clock keeps ticking and the arrerage will grow; but you can't get blood from a stone(r).|`|B6c7BeDnaa	he will still owe it.although it will accumulate during his stay.|`|XNfjaPaSaa	If he's not in jail right now, then file for child support based on what his income is.  If he goes to jail after a support order is entered, I think it will continue to accrue unless he goes to court to request it be modified.<br>  <br>  "you should go ahead and file for court ordered support, however, by doing this he is entitled to visitation"<br>  <br>  Only if he in return files something with the court to request visitation, and if he does you should have the chance to argue that contact with him is not in the child's best interests, or at least that it should be supervised.|`|A8k9NHigaa	you should go ahead and file for court ordered support, however, by doing this he is entitled to visitation, unless, you provide information that proves he should not be around the child. You need to speak with someone from family and children services in your area. They can help, and will save you any atty fees. Good Luck!|`|paerqxfMaa	If he's in jail, he ain't making any money to pay you support - simple.|`|wg78UkxFaa	It sounds as though your going to have your hands full.<br>  <br>  If he ends up going to jail, you most likely won't be able to get child support while he locked up.  Once he is back on the out side then you should be able to go after him for the support payments.   So that most likely you will have to wait to be able to get the back support from him once he's released from jail.<br>  <br>  As far as him being able to have access to the child I would speak with an attorney to keep him away from the child, due to his selling drugs.  And due to the fact that he does have a past history of selling drugs then as well.  No child should be around some one who is either using or selling drugs of any kind.  I'm sure that a good lawyer will be able to help you with that.<br>  <br>  I don't blame you for not wanting your child around him.  But you do want to make sure that what ever you do it will be all legal so that he won't have any recourse to have visitation.<br>  <br>  Again get a lawyer so that you can protect your child from him and his illegal activities.   I wish you and your baby to be all the best in the world.  God bless you both, things will get better!|`|vZy28Yqjaa	I would consider getting yourself and the child as far away from him as possible. If you don't disclose him as the father you will not be haunted by him in the future. The little support he pays won't be worth your stress. Your child will then have the chance to know a decent father if you find a better guy, and won't be tied to having a loser dad.|`|nEsuEbGGaa	des people don't know crep about wad they are talkin' about you know. dey do pay salary in jail so's dey can buy cigs or save up for when dey leave jail. dey giv da prsoners jobs like helpin' make food and what not. dey don't just let da prisoners get vacation and sit around dey make em work and dey get paid, i mean not so good but dey do make em pay child support in jail.|`|F6yfJSr9aa	It seems like you could get child support, but I don't know.  You should probably consult with a lawyer. When I had a legal question, I used quicklegalanswer.com. It was fast and very cheap. It helped me with my dispute, it can likely help you with yours. Anywho, best of luck!!
AA11206283	You need to give us a bit more about what is being consented to and by who and where.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	Consent for what?
KTM5JEkLaa	Your lawyer's response seems a little strange.  That he will sue them is all fine and good, but you will still be subjected to the inconvenience, stress, and ramifications of being arrested, charged, booked, etc.  He will be comfy in his law office filling out paperwork and waiting for his check to come in.  I personally would consult a different lawyer and see what they say.<br>  <br>  That said, yes, she should be punished.  In Florida, using someone else's name with these results can be punished as a felony.  If you can prove she did use your name illegally, which I assume you do, I would insist that she be charged with it.  If the police don't cooperate, I would contact the local prosecutor.  The catch is that you will have to be willing to throw a relative under the bus.|`|Y9Sj56D5aa	u would think she would already be in trouble for giving fault information but who knows now days .|`|AA11352641	I'm not a lawyer, but not showing up to court when you are summoned is ill-advised to me. I would go to the court date, show them your time sheet from work that day, and state that your cousin used your name and you would like to press charges against her. Surely the security officers that arrested her will attend court and will realize that you are not the same person they caught. OR go to the police station and if she was actually arrested they will have a mugshot of her which will show that it isn't you. If you don't show up to court, they will put a warrant out for your arrest, come and get you THEN you will have to state your case. The officer that shows up with handcuffs is not going to let you off right then and there.|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	You are lucky you do not have a common name,sh^t happens to me all the time.I once had a warrant out for me on a traffic ticket that someone got for speeding,no proof of insurance and no drivers license.I found out about it when I was going to renew my license.When I called the court clerk and asked about it I wondered how they got my name if there was no drivers license.Anyway I had to prove to them that I wasn't black as stated on the description before they would drop the warrant against me.<br>  <br>  I am always getting bills for things that I have nothing to do with....it would cost me a fortune if I had to get an attorney every time something came up.
OiAl6w48aa	That's the date that something needs to happen by.  Its a reminder to the court clerk staff to pull the file on that date and see if "X" got done or not.  Then it gets kicked up the chain if it did not.<br>  <br>  Example: John files a motion for summary judgment against Bill in their lawsuit.  Bill has until the 31st of January to file a response.  The clerk will pull the file on the 1st of February to see if the response was filed.  If not, the clerk will forward the file to the judge for decision.  John may win his motion by default.
AA10123414	When you signed up for the trial you gave them permission to ship and to charge your card unless you canceled by a certain time. This agreement is binding.<br>  <br>  Read the agreement. It should contain how to cancel. Follow that process.|`|5fdgfNCRaa	That's how they trap you. It's the "small print" that they'll send you the trial, then each month they send you the full order and charge your credit card if you don't cancel your trial by a certain day. <br>  <br>  They probably mentioned it quickly when you ordered, but didn't stress it. (of course)<br>  <br>  I had that happen with some thing I ordered a couple years ago.<br>  <br>  Just call and cancel. You should be okay, but I don't think they'll reimburse you for what you've already received.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
6OLiuM9Gaa	I was Navy for 25 years. It really doesn't make much difference what you THINK you "want." The best plan is to go in, take your ASVAB, and then listen to the laundry list of jobs for which you're best suited. <br>  <br>  The ASVAB is designed to indicate your interests, abilities and education that qualify you for the different ratings (Navy "jobs" or specialties). Sure, the recruiters will try to steer you towards those for which there is a current need, but the decision is up to you.<br>  <br>  I enlisted with a BA in math. I didn't know what I wanted exactly. I figured something in supply or maybe some CICS position where I might be able to use my math and computer skills. But the Navy had different ideas, and in Boot Camp my rating selected me. When it came time for me to reenlist or to extend for my E-6, somebody dusted off my degree and recommended me for OCS. I retired after 25 years of service.<br>  <br>  My cousin was a pretty phenomenal musician in high school. He joined the Navy because I did, but he had his heart set on the Navy Band. The Navy had different ideas and made him a BT. They sent him to a ton of schools. When he got out after 18 years, he got a job as Building Inspector for a city in Washington state. He's retiring this year and plans to travel. When he's done traveling, the city for which he works has offered him a "consulting" position... same job, twice the salary, and he gets to pick his own hours and projects.<br>  <br>  Advice: Take your ASVAB... cold... don't prepare for it using practice tests. It's not supposed to tell how well you take tests. It's really not all that tough. It might show that you'd make an awesome GM or EOD... or it might indicate that another rating might be better suited to your interests, abilities and education. <br>  <br>  Here's the deal... it doesn't make any difference what job you wind up with. You can make of it whatever you want. There are always going to be things you can complain about. You may not like the job. It may not be what you had envisioned. You may not like the people you work for, work with, or who work under you. You may not like the working environment. You may not like the accommodations, or the food, or a host of other things. But you get that in any job... even in the civilian world... and, in the military, it's only going to be that way for a couple years or so... and then you can get transferred. <br>  <br>  As I said, I was in for 25 years. I started out enlisted and then, because of my degree, was recommended for OCS. I spent a tad over 20 years as an officer. I won't tell you it was all fun and games, or that there weren't any "rough" spots. But, had it been mostly a bad experience, I wouldn't have stayed with it for a quarter of a century.<br>  <br>  I remember my first few days in Boot Camp... almost 50 years ago. I remember getting up before the sun and stumbling (trying to march) to breakfast. People around me were grumbling about the hour and the cold... and the food. Me? I thought the sunrises in San Diego were beautiful and thought about the poor saps who were still sleeping and missing them. I preferred marching in the cool of the day rather that in the heat... they complained about the heat too. And the food? Well, it wasn't my mom's cooking, but it wasn't bad.<br>  <br>  If you find a job that you're pretty good at, you'll enjoy it more than if it's just hard work. A high school counselor once told me (probably the only sage advice I ever got from a counselor) that there's nothing better than doing a job your good at and that you like... and that getting paid to do it is like icing on the cake.<br>  <br>  And here's a hint from an old squid... even if you find yourself scrubbing toilets... you can grumble and be just another dissatisfied toilet scrubber, or you can try your hardest to become the best toilet scrubber on the planet.|`|9I3wHIdraa	Do you think these jobs will help you when you get out?<br>  If you want a bomb squad job later then may EOD.<br>  Try communications!|`|hwbtEVFHaa	Navy EOD may not be as glamorized as Navy Seal, but the EOD Pipeline will be just as difficult, in a differently way.

Like BO born in Kenya with a Hawaii birth record not certificate.|`|CM3Fl3WRaa	Mother is a Mexican citizen. Child is a US citizen. Mother can return home with her US citizen baby.

EenbVs8Oaa	Failure is a good thing, its one of the most precious things.  You never learn from success, you take it for granted, you always learn from failure.<br>  <br>  Removing failure from the human development would be like removing rain from the weather pattern.|`|QdxLCB0Raa	Allowing huge businesses to fail isn't a realistic an option. Allow GM to go down and all their workers go out of work, all their suppliers go out of work and it causes a chain reaction that ends in mass unemployment. You're better of subsidising GM now, than dealing with that level of unemployment. Probably costs less than all the medicare/unemployment benefits/etc would.<br>  <br>  Same with the banks, you allow them to fail then consumer confidence goes through the flaw, people start losing any savings investments they had that are still worth anything. People stop spending and save as much as they can because they're scared of what's coming.<br>  <br>  So loans aren't available because the banks have failed, no-one who can spend is spending because they're scared, and unemployment numbers are through the roof. That's a recipe for another Great Depression.<br>  <br>  That's why you can't let some businesses just fail. The funeral costs more than the life support.|`|Z65KWSInaa	It's the same concept as every kid being picked for the team.  I personally find it hilarious.  At the moment.

This recession is supposed to teach us this difference.  I suppose that is a lesson our grandchildren will have to learn for us.  Obama is like a 16 year old girl with Daddy's credit card. <br>  I say LET THEM FAIL!!!!  These big businesses fail.  Small businesses work hard and pick us back up.

If your director did the exact opposite, I would not want to work for somebody like that. However, times are tough, let's deal with the cards you do have.<br>  <br>  * is there enough room in the old office for the item(s) in question?<br>  * WHO gave you the permission to have it delivered to YOUR place "until the move"? Any evidence of that?<br>  * was there ANY sort of written acknowledgement from your superiors (supervisor and director) about this purchase? Maybe "As per your direction..." e-mail(s)? replies? Memos?<br>  * where is the item NOW? In the office? When did you bring it in? Did any one "sign" for it? Did any one see you brought it in? Any PROOF that you did bring it in?<br>  <br>  If all the paperwork ends with the stuff in YOUR possession, and you have no proof that you brought it back into the office, and I am afraid there are very little you CAN do except to dig up evidence of your innocence, i.e. the stuff themselves. <br>  <br>  ---<br>  Kasey C, PC guru since Apple II days<br>  We are born naked, wet and hungry.

t3QAaSN9aa	Bush 43 is probably nervous as Obama continues his efforts to save the economy and as Congress looks into Bush administration wrongdoing. <br>  <br>  The Bush approval ratings that you cite are laughable considering the extremely low approval rating that he had when he left office.|`|39KUKALFaa	The reality of Bush is that the economy tanked because he entered a room where the Dems had spilt gasoline all over the floor and on barrels of oil by forcing bankers to lend to uncreditworthy borrowers.<br>  <br>  A clever and sincere man would have turned off the light and locked the door, while working out how to douse the place in water or something better.<br>  <br>  George decided that he did not care, even though he knew about it, because he proposed legislation that the Democrats blocked. It would have gone a long way to solve the problem.<br>  <br>  But bad character will out. He and Cheney were so greedy for Texas and Wyoming that they decided to put the oil price through the roof.<br>  <br>  First, they manipulated the strategic petroleum reserve. Congress had to close that down. They were using it as a price support for Arabian oil.<br>  <br>  Second, they refused to police the Iraqi oil fields, so they never recovered production.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, they kept in place Bush I's ban on the drilling offshore. This was an executive order in addition to the legislative ban.<br>  <br>  Fourthly, they decided that when McCain/Palin was about to win, that they would kill Lehman Brothers to throw Obama the election, because he is against offshore oil drilling. Bush went on television 3 times before the election to tank the economy. He could have waited until after the election and he could have bailed Lehman out. He bailed everyone else out. Lehman had money market funds like bank accounts and this is what killed intermediation by non-banks.<br>  <br>  The sum of all these is that Bush is not only a crook, but the higher oil prices amounted to the straw that broke the camel's back - in this case, people's budgets. People could not afford their mortgages. In prolonging the Iraq War, he is probably capable of being prosecuted for war crimes. I think that he should be as an example of what happens when you put country last.<br>  <br>  But I agree that he did not create the situation, but he tried to take advantage of it and tanked the economy, the GOP, the country and McCain/Palin. He is a miserable sob.
gasquENMaa	When a person is convicted of a felony crime and is sent to prison, quite a few "rights" are lost. Among them is this right to privacy. Inmates are strip searched for various reasons. Every time they enter and leave visitation. Every time they enter and leave the institution for any trips. Anytime we are shaking down a cell or block or have reason to believe an inmate is attempting to hide contraband or stolen items from us. <br>  <br>  I can literally pat or strip search any inmate during the course of my work day for any valid reason and I do not have to file reports to do so. This is an accepted routine of prison life.<br>  <br>  Searches are always same gender. The only provision ( in Ohio where I work and live) is that during emergency situations ( aftermath of a riot, etc), female officers can assist in strip searches. Male officers ( even under emergency situations) are NOT allowed to assist in female inmate searches.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps and you can find it useful<br>  Source(s):<br>  20 years as a Corrections Officer in a max prison|`|ulzWumWPaa	Any time they want, as often as they want.

a66nvk0taa	German citizenship is not automatically received through marriage. However provided certain other conditions are met you have the right to naturalization after at least two years of marriage if you have already been legally resident in the Federal Republic of Germany for three years. OMI I wish you would backup your evidence about citizenship by marriage. What a silly answer your German teacher got citizenship because she spoke German. That like saying if someone in India speaks English they get UK citizenship. Let me guess you never been out of USA rite thought so. Sidwell Germany does allow dual citizenship. Danny if you decide to keep your American citizenship and live in German you won't get free health care etc. You would be regarded as an American citizen. No you don't get free health if you study as an American in Germany. All international students in Germany have to have health cover while studying in Germany.  This the one thing American think when they marry someone from an EU country that they going to get everything free etc. Health care social welfare etc. This is not true. The reason is they haven't paid any national insurance to be entitle to this.

RNEIC8X0aa	Liberals, leftists, social progressives,socialists,Marxists, and Obama supporters,we as americans have stuck together as a nation since our founding fathers saw fit to grace us with a new nation, but this latest election process has made me realize that I want a divorce. A divorce from the nuts who have turned our constitution into tolet paper. <br>  <br>  I know, we have tolerated each other for many years for the sake of future generations, but, sadly, this relationship has run its course.  Our two ideological sides of America cannot, and will not ever agree on what is right, so let's just end it on friendly terms.  We can smile, chalk it up to irreconcilable differences, and go our own way.<br>  <br>  Here is my proposed separation agreement:<br>  <br>  Our two groups can equitably divide up the country by landmass each<br>  taking a portion.  That will be the difficult part, but I am sure our two sides can come to a friendly agreement.  After that it should be<br>  relatively easy!<br>  <br>  Our respective representatives can effortlessly divide other assets since both sides have such distinct and disparate tastes.  <br>  <br>  We don't like redistributive taxes so you can keep them.  You are welcome to the liberal judges and the ACLU. Since you hate guns and war, we'll take our firearms, the cops, the NRA, and the military.  You can keep Oprah, Michael Moore, and Rosie O'Donnell and the likes there of. We'll keep the capitalism, greedy corporations, pharmaceutical companies, Wal-Mart, and Wall Street.  <br>  <br>  You can have your beloved homeless, homeboys, hippies, and illegal aliens.  We'll keep the hot Alaskan hockey moms, greedy CEO's, and rednecks. <br>  <br>  We'll keep the Bibles and give you NBC and all of Hollywood. You can make nice with Iran and Palestine and we'll retain the right to invade and hammer places that threaten us.  You can have the peaceniks, and war protesters.<br>  <br>  When our allies or our way of life are under assault, we'll help provide<br>  them security. We'll keep our Christian values.  You are welcome<br>  to Islam, Scientology, Humanism, and Shirley McClain.  <br>  <br>  You can also have the U.N., along with the NAACP, and all the global warming groups. But we will no longer be paying the bill.  Knowing your concerns about "excess population", in your part of the country you can overcome the problem of excess population through gay marriages and choosing to kill the unborn.<br>  <br>  We'll keep the cattle since you don't like beef anyway.<br>  We'll keep the SUVs, pickup trucks, Hummers,and oversized luxury cars.  You can take every Subaru station wagon and ethanol vehicle you can find. <br>  <br>  You can give everyone healthcare, if you can find any practicingdoctors. We 'll continue to believe healthcare is a luxury and not a right.  <br>  <br>  We'll keep The Battle Hymn of the Republic and the National Anthem and of course the constitution(without all the crazy ammendments) and the bill of right.  <br>  <br>  I'm sure you'll be happy to substitute Imagine, I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing, Kumbaya, or We Are the World.<br>  <br>  We'll practice trickle down economics, and you can give trickle up poverty your best shot.  Since it often so offends you, we'll keep our<br>  history (go and bad), our name, and our flag since ya'll know that it is already hated around the world.<br>  <br>  In the spirit of friendly parting, I'll bet you ANWAR which one of us<br>  will need whose help in 15 years.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	No. He never promised that the dow would go up.

The attorney fee does include services that you are unaware exist, not just for the attorneys time or knowledge.  You would have to discount all of these as well or pay for them separately.

I have no idea where the % came from or what it applies to.  We must afford sweeping generalizations when it comes to reductions as should be given to increases.<br>  <br>  So, in conclusion and to answer your question, No, I don't think Obama/Congress would be for such a law.

yGXKYptjaa	I dare say that we are being hood winked on this matter.  Once I worked in a real dangerous area and sold cars, used,second hand I mean pre owned.  The con when I got there was to tel the people it would be hard to get them financed and never tel them you could, because if you did they would go somewhere else, but by magic you got them financed. The main problem I saw is the owner and other people would shake the customer.  I noticed that the cars normally broke down and the people didn't have any money to fix and they had to punt or stop paying on the car.<br>  <br>  If 92% account receiveables is paying and 8% not, then i wonder if that is good, considering the housing market didn't start declining until a couple of years ago.<br>  <br>  So I got in trouble for ths, but I found a company that would put a warrenty on the cars for $700.  Well the owner had a fit, but when I took him aside and explained we would get a $200 "kickback" from the warrenty company he gt all excited and forgot that they cold have shaken the people down for the other $500 as a down payment.<br>  <br>  So right now i believe that this selliing "preowned" homes to bad credit risk people started under Pres. Clinton.  Now I also noticed at this car ot that many of the people, once n the car wold end up not payng and the car wold be repoed.  So my point is this has been going on for a long time, for over what 10-11 or more years?  During that time they must know how many of these people or an average have not been able to aford the houses.  They cannot tell us that all of a sudden these people just punted n the houses .<br>  <br>  my point is what are they hiding and why are they tryng to pull the wool over our eyes?  Now like some kid seeing a hotrod and the salepeson knows they have to have the car and jerk the person around with high price and payment.  I have heard some were financed and the people gave them a payment they could afford and then said wellin a year or two the payment will double.  If so then the person must have thoght they could get an extra job or win the lottery.<br>  <br>  But the ones that were put in the homes and with the same payment and still couldn't make the payments may be the norm,.  I mean think about this, are we paying for bad debt that these finacial people have had riding on the books for over a decade?<br>  <br>  We don't know and that's why I think this is a con job.  All these people just all of the sudden stopped paying?  I feel we will never know the way they are handling this.  It's like having a crooked estate attorney, cpa and executor all rolled in a nice package, but we also have the judges on the take that are allowing this to move right along.<br>  <br>  Seems to me if lyou get a small business loan you have to jump through hoops and account for everything, but these cats ahve not even been asked to do this.<br>  <br>  By the way is it really 8% and what is the norm for "normal" home buyers.  You mentioned FEMA, guy I know was making $460 a day all he did was sit in a chair at a waste dump and count the loads of trash they brought in.  Now he had to pay for a place to stay, food and any illegal drugs he bought, but that was it.  What a waste.<br>  <br>  This whole thing stinks as do say Bank of America, they have been buyng out everythng they could get there hands off and then, in my case tacked a $35 late fee on the first bill, lwhich I had to jump through hoops to get them to remove, but the card company they bought probably had half a million customers and i assume my case was not a mistake and the 'average" of people who would notice it, then call in about it, then explain after the third call that another card company years before had been sued in a class action law suit and lost for this same practice may not be that many.  So BOA probably raked in some serious cash.<br>  <br>  By the way why where these companies buying up all the other ones.  I never wanted nor used a BOA card and when this one was tranferred I cancelled it<br>  <br>  Hope this makes sense and is long winded, but I feel we are being jerked around and the government is not even taking steps to assure anything, it is just insane.<br>  <br>  Last athing.  Why forgive the difference in the amount the house has lost value?  Does that mean that in the futrue if the house goes up in value that they will want that money?  What they need to do is allow the people to stay in the houses on what they have are were able to pay, it the note went way up, then put it back to what they were able to pay and tack the difference between the acceptable rate and the high rate onto the end of the mortgage.  This way everyone wins, the people stay in the home, the "bank" get's it's money and the house stays off the market and doesn't drive down prices. By the way the first car I put the warenty on, the guy took his family up to Chicago to visit relatives.  when he got back the engine fell out and for $1000 he got a new one, then the transmission and heating slystem, no joke, but he was paying driving.  I am also burned out on Littl|`|C7FtRe69aa	Since the reduction of foreclosures will save the banks and stop the decline in housing prices, we all will benefit.<br>  <br>  btw: The number of people at risk of losing their homes due to this second Bush recession is now 45 percent of all homeowners. There are more people standing to benefit from a strong America than 8 percent.<br>  <br>  I have a question. When FEMA rushes in and helps a community that has been destroyed by a tornado, do you say "Let them die, it is only a small percentage of Americans"? Most American policies help only a small percentage of the population, yet with sound policies, we all benefit. It is the very nature of a community, everyone sacrifices a little bit, but gains a lot more than they put in.<br>  <br>  Most Americans are willing to contribute to the common good and to the defense of America. Why are you Republicans so set against doing your fair share? Isn't America worth your support? Or do you agree with Rush Limbaugh and the bulk of the Republican party leadership that you hope that rescue attempt fail and that America goes down the toilet?|`|cc198e7f4ab424c24743237d7bdb642aaa	I quit paying mine.

What's the problem?  I'm thinking that's what everybody should do.  Don't worry about having to prove your insolvency, just max out all your credit lines on all the things you've always wanted, then claim bankruptcy.

I'm no Bush lover, but to blame him because people bought houses that were overvalued, on terms they didn't understand is beyond outrageous.  It was your lefties like Barney Frank, Chris Dodd, and Maxine Waters who pushed so hard against reforms for Fannie and Freddie.  Your blaming Bush for EVERYTHING is not only old, but weak.  ****Of course the value of ALL homes is dropping, because ALL homes were overvalued.  Of course more and more hardworking people are losing their jobs and can't make their payments.  Of course conservatives feel for them.   But the way to keep them in their homes is to re-employ them, not bail out an inflated market.  The way to re-employ them is not to consciously let the market continue to tank by federalizing the economy, raising taxes on investors, and talking down our potential.|`|159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	Ron Paul is more correct than most people will ever comprehend.<br>  <br>  Me, I'm back to Carternomics.

If you read the details closer you'd understand that the people with foreclosures are not getting their mortgages dismissed.  They are merely trying to renegotiate the leading terms (i.e. interest rates, payment schedules, etc) in order to make sure they can stay in their homes.  Also there are strict guidelines that it must be a primary home and even after restructuring a set percentage of income to mortgage must be maintained.|`|X81oLqMtaa	I'm paying mortgages on 2 homes while watching the value decline.<br>  <br>  So far I'm ahead or even on both mortgages.<br>  <br>  If my neighbors get foreclosed on and the values of my homes decrease to the point where I'm too far in the red, I'm going to allow my home to get foreclosed on as well to get out from under that toxic debt.<br>  <br>  Not sure what the best solution is but if things get much worse, there is going to be a massive domino effect through the housing market.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	The 8% is an educated guess, as for the poor decision factor, many have lost their homes, or are about to not because of poor decision making, but because of the poor economy that little georgie bush has left behind.<br>  <br>  How does one one make the monthly notes when the primary income earner has lost their job?|`|c6b7a10c63265cc871ef2c76bb9a82c4aa	He pretty much summed it up in a nutshell.<br>  <br>  Actually the overall  percentage is at around 12%.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090305/ap_on_bi_ge/states_foreclosures">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090305/ap_o...</a><br>  <br>  The markets HAVE to correct themselves.

The executor, attorneys, two firms, and the two accounting firms have and or defrauding the government, stealing the estate and broken so many laws it is incredible.  They are able to have anything "rubber stamped" by the local judges (for a price).  On one deal the judge obviously looked like he was going to make them do an accounting, next time in court they have gone up $100,000 on a deal, the executor gets an additional $30,000 for his trouble concerning this and I was wondering where the other $70,000 was going.

Now, if you lose your job and can't meet your financial obligations, then you are insolvent.<br>  <br>  As long as people don't withdrawl all capital from the system and start hoarding cash, the flow of money will continue and obligations met... just like having a job with a home loan.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  And just to add a touch of realism for you, the bill that allowed much of this mess to happen was signed by Clinton.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramm-Leach-Bliley_Act" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramm-Leach...</a><br>  <br>  And for those of you who think that it was government's fault for making banks make loans under the CRA, you're wrong as well.  All you have to do is pay real attention, not listen to others.  Read/listen to Congressional testimony from former CEOs of Freddie and Fannie and Alan Greenspan and you'll figure out that this issue is not because of CRA.<br>  <br>  And yes, Republicans were correct on re-regulating Fannie and Freddie.  But they aren't the only ones who were doing this stuff, which is why the problem continues to echo from bank to bank to bank after the Feds fixed Fannie and Freddie.|`|AA11295048	This is the result of the Community Re-investment Act of 1977, a Democrat congress and a Democrat finance committee that said " we see no problem with Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac ".|`|LA1ZKPSYaa	You know, the "silver lining" to this cloud is that all you folks are going to learn the principals of economics, too bad its the hard way.<br>  <a href="http://RussAlan.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://RussAlan.blogspot.com</a>|`|FpMCFvV5aa	No.  This is what happens when you have a Congress that writes laws that force banks to make loans to people who are financially unqualified.|`|bn0axDktaa	No, this is what 96 years under the federal reserve has got us.|`|EenbVs8Oaa	Nice article, whats tax cuts got to with it?|`|3Z4YFz29aa	good thing I own shares of JP Morgan!|`|AA11702773	So BofA uses bailout funds to buy Merrill Lynch and Countrywide, and now needs bailing out for THOSE bad decisions.<br>  <br>  This is not tax cuts, though.

XhexwM1faa	here's a brief summary of whats the three branches do:<br>  <br>  legislative branch/Congress: creates and passes all new laws pertaining to the military, the bureaucracy, any issue of public policy, their article 1 section 8 powers, etc; determines whether or not we will go to war; is the branch that represents the will of the people (in theory)<br>  <br>  executive branch/presidency: enforces the laws that Congress passes. So if Congress passes a law saying everybody will pay 10% in income taxes, it is the executive branch's job to enforce this (which in the case of taxes, they do through the IRS). The president is the leader of the executive branch, and he not only leads the executive branch in forcing laws passed by congress, but he also represents the USA in foreign relations, he is the commander in chief of the military, and he can play a legislative role by issuing executive orders or by vetoing legislation passed by Congress. <br>  <br>  judicial branch/supreme court: they settle disputes arising between states or between citizens and a state. They were created to be an arbitrator in statutory law, but thanks to Marbury vs. Madison, their biggest role is using judicial review as a "check" on Congress and the president.<br>  <br>  I hope this makes sense. I take it you are in a freshmen civics class

7130dcb06a591c8850f1c6de810da84aaa	That is an excellent question. The answer isn't that easy. What will happen is that those who normally buy our debt, in the form of Treasuries, will simply refuse to take the risk anymore. At that point, the FED will buy the treasuries anonymously. the reason it will be anonymous is that it is the financial equivalent of a perpetual motion machine of the first kind, and the FED would not want anyone to know that they are doing it.<br>  <br>  However, it will be fairly obvious that no one bid on the Treasuries, so the subterfuge will be useless. As time goes on, it will become harder and harder to sell the debt and the FED will continue to step in to do so. At some point this constant influx of FED support will dilute the money supply and those that bought the debt previously will try to get rid of the devaluing dollars. When this happens there will be an unlimited number of dollars chasing a limited number of goods. That is called hyperinflation.<br>  <br>  Historical hyperinflation periods have seen people going to the store with literally wheelbarrows full of cash to buy a loaf of bread. Zimbabwe is a good example where they have just started issuing a $50,000,000,000 note worth a little over a penny US.<br>  <br>  Welcome to Obama's dream.|`|nr96BgWfaa	Already, crime is up, suicides are up, depression is up, drug use is up, sex crimes are up, sleeplessness is up, drastically since Obama started dismantling our economy.<br>  <br>  If this continues, we will see riots and looting and mass anarchy.<br>  <br>  All that money he's throwing away, will be just that, thrown away, along with society as we know it.|`|ujIinLzGaa	No, because we just keep printing money.

A few people have tried and they are gone now. When all the money that the people of the US pay in taxes (a tax which was put in place to pay back the Fed) is not even enough to pay the interest owed to the Fed, then the US is already in a form of bankruptcy. <br>  The answer to your question is a lot more complicated, but when you consider that the US is in debt along the lines of about 10 trillion dollars, the word bankruptcy doesn't even apply any more, it's way beyond bankrupt. The major thing that saves the US is that everyone buys their oil with US dollars, and as long as that's the case, the US economy will fluctuate dramatically but never become insolvent.|`|p5F2LtmNaa	Get ready for the cash-less society within the insanity of the New World Order.<br>  <br>   Yes it can!

Where is John Galt?|`|HLHHM4Mtaa	It is understandable that we have to support our various city, county, state, and federal governments for the sake of organization and for the common good of the people through taxation for these governing entities provide needed services and civilized structure to our society. However, when these entities go to an extreme in demanding that taxation include doing things for people that they can do for themselves they then enter into the category of being enablers for the masses and at that juncture a revolution is needed by those who pay those taxes.  That time is rapidly approaching.  It really doesn't matter so much what the statement means to me, but I do so hope that our elected representatives take it as a warning that we the people are catching on to what's happening and will not for long tolerate a government that goes to such an extreme.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	it means that big spending democrats and republicans are almost always constantly involved in legal plunder<br>  <br>  EDIT: Darwin roads are built through gas taxes.

Very true though some people seem to think that it really is free; the government has no money except for what it takes in from taxes or fees so can only give things by paying for it with those (redistribution of wealth), borrowing which delays the paying back and increases cost because of interest, or by printing money which leads to inflation and higher prices.  Nothing in life is free.|`|G49lKR56aa	It's a true statement!<br>  To give to, oh let's say an illegal alien the rights of a citizen, they must first take the rights of a citizen away!<br>  Or to give to special interest groups something they did not work for, or deserve, they must take from some one who worked for what they have!|`|lyhnHhuWaa	It means the government is broke and can't redistribute wealth unless it takes it from those who earn it.

ASXeYOjAaa	Here are some obvious truths readily discernible with little more attention than - not being in a coma:<br>  - We already have the best heath care selection and accessibility in the World.<br>  - People perceive a crisis because of the LIE shoved down our throats that "people can't get health care" when this is simply not true.<br>  - When "they" whine about "health care" they are without exception actually talking about insurance or some other means of separating the consumer from the payment. A lot of us are without health INSURANCE and almost all by choice. NO ONE is unable to get health CARE. No one!!<br>  - The artificially created preference for "third party" payment is demonstrably the REASON costs are up. There is no legitimate debate on this.<br>  - The "cure" we supposedly MUST do lest we all die is to take the SAME concept even farther although 100% of times and places where such has been done have witnessed an INCREASE in misery, deprivation and death. NO exceptions exist nor is one possible.<br>  - People way to stupid to be allowed out unattended nonetheless believe the big health care lie. <br>  - Absolutely no one else does.|`|un0C52G8aa	I'd much reather listen to that than hear the constant rhetoric about terrorists and how we should be supporting the quagmire in Iraq.

So much for Republicans standing for small government and limited spending.<br>  <br>  Now, I'm assuming that some of you are young and haven't faced any serious health issues and don't know anyone who has. Until you have had to deal with insurance companies and worrying about whether your treatments will be covered or if your company has decided to drop you because you are cutting into its profits, then I think you don't really understand what you're talking about.

The man has not been in office for three months yet!<br>  <br>  This meltdown is a product of decades of fiscal policy, beginning with the deregulation of the market by the Reagan Administration.  It was encouraged by the export of capital and manufacturing jobs during the first Bush administration and ignored by Bill Clinton.<br>  <br>  Now, thanks to the ideological blinders worn by George W. Bush and his fellow conspirators, we have destroyed our national infrastructure as effectively as the corporations have their own.  Our plants are closed or in disrepair because not a penny has been reinvested in current technology.  Our schools and roads have been treated to a dose of the same philosophy.<br>  <br>  Conservatives take care of their possessions.  We accept that as a part of the responsibility of ownership because of the cost of replacement.  This is fiscal prudence.  Somehow the Republican party has fallen into the hands of people who espouse conservatism but refuse to practice it.<br>  <br>  This economic disaster comes from that neglect.  Obama may or may not be able to fix the damage, but it is unfair to blame him for the mess we made ourselves.  We elected the snake oil salesmen and we drank the Elixir.  Once we are suffering from the effects of poison is it fair to blame the doctor if we get sick?<br>  <br>  To use a different analogy, we bought a get rich quick scheme and got taken.  Is it the policeman's fault, or should we have known better?<br>  <br>  The Great Depression was caused by greed and dishonesty in unregulated markets.  The South Sea Bubble that collapsed the European economy in the mid 1700s was exactly the same.  It isn't as though history has not been warning us; it's just that we didn't listen.<br>  <br>  I doubt that the stimulus package will work, because it does not reclaim the lost manufacturing sector.  However, the Republican alternative of more tax cuts and deregulation is so gratuitously inadequate we are left with no credible alternative.|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	With the bailout plans of last year and this year being entirely deficit spending, the interest payments on the national debt will be the largest item in the federal budget in 2010.  That's what happens when you spend more than you make every single year for FORTY FREAKING YEARS.  This is not just an Obama problem.  Congress has continually raised the debt ceiling since 1969.  If you or I did that we'd have to file for bankruptcy.  Can you imagine if I called my credit card company and asked them to raise my "debt ceiling"?  It's laughable that anyone in Congress thought this could continue indefinitely with no consequences.  It's like they've just been passing it off for 40 years until it has gotten to a point where we're almost 11 trillion dollars in debt and somehow are using money we don't have to save banks that don't have money either from collapsing under the weight of their own bad decisions.<br>  <br>  It's ludicrous.|`|C7FtRe69aa	If you don't like the results of Republican policies then don't vote Republican.

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Unfortunately a lot of folks on yahoo answers are sadly misinformed, folks from all sides.<br>  <br>  American children grow up in impoverished homes. When compared with 20 other wealthy nations on measures of health, safety and relative poverty, America's children fare amongst the worst.<br>  In terms of the human development index, the United States has fallen from second place in 1990 (behind Canada) to 12th place. This decline continued through both the Clinton and Bush administrations, with the US falling to sixth in 1995, ninth in 2000, and 12th in 2005.<br>  In certain respects, the decline is even worse. The US is 34th in infant mortality—with a level comparable to Croatia, Estonia, Poland and Cuba. US school children perform significantly below their counterparts in countries like Canada, France, Germany and Japan, and 14 percent of the population, some 40 million people, lack basic literacy and number skills. Of the world’s 30 richest nations, which comprise the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United States has the highest proportion of children living in poverty, 15 percent, and the most people in prison, both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of the whole population. With five percent of the world’s population, the US has 24 percent of the world’s prisoners.<br>  The report notes: “Social mobility is now less fluid in the United States than in other affluent nations. Indeed, a poor child born in Germany, France, Canada or one of the Nordic countries has a better chance to join the middle class in adulthood than an American child born into similar circumstances.”<br>  In overall life expectancy, the United States ranks an astonishing 42nd, behind not only Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and all the countries of Western Europe, but also Israel, Greece, Singapore, Costa Rica and South Korea.|`|8RflQ9DVaa	If you mean 'classless' as in 'no class', then I would have to say if I derived my opinions about Americans based on what I read here on Yahoo Answers... well...

But more than just about any other country the United States has class mobility. No one is indentured to the class they were born into.  Most everyone has the opportunity to improve their circumstances.

5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	Yes, it exists. Now, what solution would you suggest? <br>  <br>  Communism doesn't do away with class.  There are still people who have a huge amount of power, and people who have hardly any. Why do you think we all care about money so much? Money gives power to it's owner. With money, you can buy food, buy a good education for your children, and, sometimes, buy politicians.  In a communist system, power is still in the hands of the few, the party leaders. <br>  <br>  The only thing you can do to make things more fair is to allow for social mobility. People in the lower classes need avenues to better things. Not everyone will take use these opportunities, however, so you'll still have a lower class.|`|5PIgZ7tFaa	Yep.

Part of being a liberal is knowing that "All-or-Nothing" politics doesn't work. Does Walmart's business practices do harm to local small business? Absolutely. Do they flood the market with cheap Chinese imports? You bet. But, American consumers don't want to buy American made goods, so there's a market for their cheap crap.|`|1fUPdDiFaa	OH YEAH. They HATE Walmart. But it's stupid, because Walmart is great for the poor people that the liberals are supposed to care so much about.

Our government is government of laws, hence the matter of legally recognizing creation of a new family through a partnership of two consenting adults is a matter for government to deal with. Churches may "bless" or condemn these legal partnerships as they wish. Whatever legal term is used, ordinary people will probably continue to refer to these partnerships as "marriage" as a matter of convenience.

Tell the banks that accepted bailout money "cut interest rates on all currently held mortgages to 3%.  That would alleviate many problems immediately. the foreclosure rate, it would put money in the pockets of individuals and stimulate the economy.  Then put money into things that WILL stimulate the economy, infrastructure, alternative fuels and oil.  The DOW is tanking because investors don't see a bright future for this country, they see out of control deficit spending.

Thank you! I should see these answers rolling in since the world is ruined!!|`|7pfCkrCzaa	Ron PAUL!!!!!!!!!!!|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Actually I'm glad you asked this because there are a few things I've been kicking around.  First I'd like to see the Federal Reserve taken over by the federal government.  A private bank controlling all of the money will only serve the needs of that private bank.  So really when you go to the bank and take out a dollar, that dollar was loaned to the government with interest, and then loaned to your bank with interest.  If you have a bank account where you loan YOUR MONEY to the bank, you get to PAY THEM service charges to get to your money as a matter of policy.  Trash that.<br>  <br>  I would like to see a diversification from financial markets, allowing people to put more into the barter system and semi-finance.  I got this idea from a book by Alvin Toffler called the Third Wave where he talked about Type B work (work that you do that you don't get paid for, this could be fixing your car, doing the laundry, yard work etc.  I think this could be more effectively used through sites like Craigs list or ebay and paid for with the finance charges from shipping costs.  Basically, any barter transaction you pay upwards of double shipping.<br>  <br>  Finally we need a long term industry to move this country toward.  Manufacturing is taking a beating but I think that is because we're not bringing in enough money from other industry to be able afford manufacture goods.<br>  <br>  Also, we need to curb our balance of export to import.  This country will make more money if we come to the point where we send out more items than what we bring in.  I know that there have been problems with piracy and I think that it would be good if we started using our military to police the seas to make shipping more viable and profitable.|`|c7d7ca36abf02ecfa04a421e9a75aaa1aa	Obama has it right that you need to stimulate the economy and set up a safety net for those that have fallen through, but the implementation of his programs are wrong.  He is over-emphasizing the safety net part and not putting enough into stimulating the economy.<br>  <br>  Giving money to banks so they can make loans will not stimulate the economy, since no one wants to take out a loan (since you don't know if you'll have a job to pay it back next year).<br>  <br>  The government needs to create demand, not prepare institutions to be ready for a demand that is not coming.  Infrastructure that will make it easy for others to make jobs is good (alternative energy, high speed internet, highways, railways, etc.)  <br>  <br>  Second, the government needs to be consistent and assertive.  The market is down and no one is taking any risk because the government is not leading- it is reacting in a knee-jerk manner.  Therefore, no one will follow the government's lead.<br>  <br>  Third, the government needs to reward those who have behaved and are working hard for a better future- not those who exercised bad judgment.|`|lW2QVnUmaa	Make people responsible for their own actions..<br>  Banks that failed, let them fail..

Do you know that their is a non-profit organization that will help you renegotiate your home loan ????  and they do this w/o a federal dime ??!!  what I am saying, is that there are private agencies/private money available to help needy people. We did not need this massive spending to get us out. We just needed smart leaders to let us know what is available to us.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	We actually are the only ones who apparently understand what's happening.<br>  <br>  Throwing money around fast and loose has never spurred an economy in history, and, amazingly enough, it's not going to succeed this time either.<br>  <br>  All the additional spending does is delay the recovery and it will make it weaker when it does come.|`|pM81f5tnaa	I follow what you're saying.  But doesn't it matter, to some extent, "where it goes"?  For one thing, if there's stuff that's important to get done (e.g., building bridges), then it's prudent to use if for those purposes.  And you'd like it to be placed in the hands of people who keep it in circulation (i.e., poor people),  rather than hoard it.|`|rWdYBmPmaa	LOL LOL LOL <br>  <br>  I can see how saving a mouse in San fransicko would stimulate the country NOT..<br>  <br>  It is 90% PORK.

It is called transfer of wealth... The same amount of money exists, it is just that the balance of power is going to change... Rather than a MARKET driven economy, you are headed for a GOVERNMENT driven economy.<br>  <br>  Just read the stimulus law. read about how states will be forced to change their laws in order to receive money for unemployment... It is called extortion. Obama is basically wiping his *** with the 10th Amendment...<br>  <br>  Read some of the TARP provisions. How car makers will be forced to make certain cars, certain ways and employ certain people for taking money... <br>  <br>  Government intrusion into MY LIFE is unacceptable!|`|whs31rERaa	false, spending does not help an economy<br>  capital does<br>  Saving money to help generate more money in the future is better than spending<br>  im not talking about hoarding either<br>  for example, i save my money up, then open a shop that sells scarves. I need to buy the scarves wholesale or from local merchants, employ people to sell the scarves for me, and then expand when i make enough CAPITAL. that helps more than just getting a government check and running out and buying a bunch of crap i dont need. <br>  ADDITIONALLY, YOU DONT NEED TO REPLACE ASSETS.<br>  thats where zombie companies and banks come from, where a corporations net worth is below zero. In this case, the corporation can't stand by itself and needs constant government pumped into it. This is what the Japanses did, and it set them back by about a decade and a half|`|E6EbbZXzaa	That would work if the cash was being infused in the economy. But it's not. It's going to plug budget holes in states, it's going to acorn, it's going to Hamas, it's going to....<br>  <br>  I'm sorry I just read this line" It doesn't really matter where it goes, as long as it goes."<br>  <br>  Give me all your money. You can stimulate the economy by giving me all your money. It doesn't matter how I spend it just as long as it gets spent. I think I'll buy all the comic books that I wish I had. We'll both be better off. <br>  <br>  Maybe the president should just spend a trillion dollars on porn. That'll stimulate the economy because it doesn't matter where it's spent. <br>  <br>  If all spending is good then just spend it all. Spend every dollar that the government possibly can and then spend another 50% of that. We'll be the wealthiest nation on Earth. <br>  <br>  I know that whenever I'm unemployed and don't have a lot of money I just go on a wild irresponsible spending spree. I buy video games and candy and toys and then I'm wealthy again.|`|D5A9JUDMaa	You are TOTALLY clueless.<br>  <br>  There is NOW 3x the amount of money in existence thanks to Obama.<br>  <br>  There is NOT 3x as many cars being sold....

NOT 3x as many houses being sold....<br>  <br>  <br>  WHEN the economy self-corrects (and it WILL correct, DESPITE all of Obama's misguided efforts)..... that 3x EXTRA money is going to BALLOON into some VERY HEAVY inflation.<br>  <br>  Obama has NO experience....and we warned you about that.    Obama has NO IDEA of the long term damage he's causing... and it's obvious that YOU don't understand it either.|`|fmDJJobTaa	Do people understand the consequences of a bubble bursting?<br>  <br>  Well Tim Geithner, the Secretary of Treasury, surely doesn't.  He thinks the housing market is stagnating and that we need to prop it up.  His solution for a bursting bubble is to prop up the bubble.  This is analogous to trying to cool down an overheated engine by stepping further down on the gas pedal.|`|39KUKALFaa	Obama's plan is for social justice - not for recovery. Social justice requires that Americans live the same way and at the same standard of living as Kenyans do. As you will be aware Kenyan leaders are rich and everyone else is poor. This is only fair.<br>  <br>  It is social justice.<br>  <br>  Further, the Obama plan was written by the brains trust at the Central Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and it bears the seal of approval of Robert Mugabe. Your pointless capitalist attacks are so passe and stupid. We do not need prosperity. Obama will abolish it and you will be a better person for that.<br>  <br>  The second instalment of the Obama blueprint was provided by special adviser Pol Pot shortly before his death in Cambodia.|`|BUjcXhQ7aa	i guess i just don't understand why he said he would not allow ANY lobbyists or earmarks. i thought i did. i figured because he said it to win support from us, and HAD to to KEEP the support of democrats. guess i was wrong....NOT!!!!|`|5hxWSezPaa	I think your economic analysis is fatally flawed.|`|4b9a85a6035089657723b2a7f272c834aa	Um, apparently you are the one who doesn't understand.|`|o0oYsQM7aa	To expand on your metaphor of the pump, how can you prime the pump until the leak is fixed?|`|2CO7pPdoaa	we understand perfectly, after all we're the ones supplying the money for your not so frugal "spending"...|`|7UqccTp6aa	You are definitely one of the brain washed sheep.

Great thing about America, for now anyway, we have freedom of speech.  Rush can say these things, and no one is forcing you to listen to them.<br>  2.  You are taking everything out of context and just finding little tidbits that the liberal media wants you to hear.<br>  3.  Like so many of your liberal comrades, you're obsessed with Rush.<br>  4.  Can you say "Jeremiah Wright"??|`|YaTgrhr9aa	Do you condone the rhetoric from Jesse Jackson, Rev Wright, Al Sharpton, Rev Farrakhan?<br>  <br>  By the way what he said is true, sorry you can't seem to get a real grasp on it.|`|0RvtrkYOaa	This is a bit funny, considering I am a republican (mostly), you seem to know more about him, and be able to quote him more than most republicans can.  So that brings up the question, who is listening to him?|`|3f7UV5zDaa	Instead of cherry picking from his shows, you should at least listen to the segment where those things were said.  I would prefer to listen to his views and his stance on Politics than anyone, I repeat, anyone from the left wing crowd!|`|WtGo7w18aa	I think he's just entertaining, like Archie Bunker on All in the Family...<br>  "Halfricans?"

Go to the Heritage Foundation and read, read, read.|`|83dcb9a2ce81f753fdaace547612e772aa	As opposed to the hate filled rhetoric and slander of the left wing?<br>  <br>  Rush is just trying to balance out the last 30 years of unadulterated lies and garbage spewed by the Liberal Left. <br>  <br>  I don't have to justify his freedom of speech, who are you to challenge it?|`|HvBvbfzzaa	I honestly think liberals are the only ones who listen to him anymore.<br>  They seem to know everything about this man...probably even knows how many times he takes a shiiit a day.|`|u4QkhmWOaa	Just raise your hand and say Heil!|`|VKGKMY2Haa	listen to his show and find out|`|5CUiOCSiaa	First your quotes are not accurate, topics are subjects Rush talks about, but quotes are wrong.<br>  <br>  Obama is the person whom we all need to be worried about.  This country is going to by-pass Socialism and head straight to Communisim.  Our economy is rapidly, very rapidly being disolved.  I have customers who are the most creidt worthy in this country and they can not get a loan, no money avaiable.  Their businesses are closing down, laying people off, so on and so forth.  Fortunatley last Summer when O secured the nomination my wife and I sold every share of stock, every investment we had accumulated over the past 40 years, including a second home.  GONE.  Now we sit on cash, out of the US., WHY you may ask.  Just watch the stock market and look at what is happening TODAY, much less since O was elected.  He INHERITED nothing, HE and the liberals created what we now have and in only two and a half years.<br>  <br>  Pretty said, pretty discouraging and totally unworkable.  What O and his team are doing is destroying our country - destroying.  <br>  <br>  My best and good luck to you all.  I am outa here- the US that is.  We leave in three days.|`|7lmtBhdMaa	I don't condone your taking things out of context. How many times have the "Leftists" added a word, left out a word, shifted them around or just flat out lied.( like SNL saying Sarah Palin said she could see Russia from her front porch. You never said anything about that.) Obama hasn't done too bad in the lying category. So far he's not  "changed" a damn thing about Washington. He's hired Lobbyist, ignoring 8600 earmarks in the Omnibus package. says he can't Veto it because it's Bushes budget (bulls*it he can Veto anything he wants but he doesn't want to get on Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid's bad side since they wrote it), taken Clinton leftovers into his Cabinet. Air Force One is a new toy to him. (He and Michelle had to go to Chicago to a favorite restaurant on Valentines Day??? That plane costs $68,000 per hour to run. One expensive dinner if u ask me.)If I were you I wouldn't worry about Rush so much as I would worry about what Obama is doing to this Country. He's sending it down the slippery slope to Socialism. Hope you enjoy being taken care of by "Big Brother"{

People may criticize her experience but she has a lot more executive experience than BO. When I look at Washington politicians, I see people like Reid and Pelosi who are only interested in political power for how it can enrich them.

Not funny laughable, but wrong laughable. <br>  <br>  Obviously Democrats take it as an article of faith that shes a disaster for Republicans, which couldnt be further from the truth. She has a high popularity rating, her state government is one of the few, probably the only, that has a massive surplus. And the only reason why Dems attack her so much is because they know how influential she is and that she represents a major threat to their power. They wouldnt waste their breath on someone who is a waste of space and doesnt pose a threat to their political power.<br>  <br>  "But *why* would she make a great candidate?"<br>  <br>  Her conservative values and credentials. She is a supporter of the right to keep and bear arms. She is probably one of the best governors in the nation (her state has a billion dollar surplus. Not a deficit. A surplus. No financial crisis under her watch). She is anti-abortion. She is for smaller government, low taxes, and low government spending. She more than talks this game, she practices it evidenced by the way she governs Alaska.<br>  <br>  The ridicule aimed at her from liberals is no different than the ridicule aimed at Ronald Reagan way back when, and look at how that turned out. Reagan is now a legendary figure in American politics and his thousands of critics have had to eat their words<br>  <br>  " The arguments presented about her effectiveness at governing her state would be more valid if her state a) wasn't separated from the continental US and b) had a higher population than around 700,000 people. "<br>  <br>  WHAT difference does that make??? Separated from the continental US or not, small population or not, its a good indicator. And by the way, according to the US census, as of 2007, the population of alaska isnt 700 thousand. Its 1,228,045 (in 1998 it was 730 thousand)<br>  <br>  Hawaii is also separated from the continental US and it too has a small population (1.2 million). But its liberal/leftist and its an economic basket case. (they tried having Universal Health care but it proved to be a major disaster and they got rid of it after only 9 months)<br>  <br>  "If she could govern Texas or any Red state that had regular goings on with the rest of the country"<br>  <br>  Alaska DOES have "regular goings on" with the rest of the country. Sheesh. If anything, it has more because its a MAJOR defense point.<br>  <br>  "What about Alaskan sentiment of separation from the Union? "<br>  <br>  There is no such sentiment.

Milton Friedman said the following about the great depression:<br>  <br>  Friedman wrote extensively on the Great Depression, which he called the "Great Contraction," arguing that it had been caused by an ordinary financial shock whose duration and seriousness were greatly increased by the subsequent contraction of the money supply caused by the misguided policies of the directors of the Federal Reserve:<br>  <br>  The Fed was largely responsible for converting what might have been a garden-variety recession, although perhaps a fairly severe one, into a major catastrophe. Instead of using its powers to offset the depression, it presided over a decline in the quantity of money by one-third from 1929 to 1933. … Far from the depression being a failure of the free-enterprise system, it was a tragic failure of government.(Friedman & Friedman 1999: 233)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Milton_Friedman" rel="nofollow">http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entr...</a>|`|w38AedkFaa	It's ok Obama had his little Wednesday night party.

gasquENMaa	Hello Joe. Without skirting the issue, you could, in theory, reschedule your next court appearance for a date when the charging officer is not available. <br>  <br>  The officer can do one of two things ( which is his choice). He can get a continuance on YOUR date by telling the court HE is not available on that date and the court will then send YOU a notice of another date to show up.<br>  <br>  He can file a written deposition to be read to the court. This would be done for a simple violation ( such as a speeding ticket, where he would list how the speed was determined and what speed you were doing, where, when , how, etc).<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that most departments pay a minimum of 4 hours report in pay when an Officer has to go to court to testify. This means he will get 4 hours pay when he is in court for 20 minutes. If he stays for over 4 hours, he will get paid for every minute he is there. Most officers don't mind going to court. It gives a nice break and they are still paid.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps and you can find it useful|`|dAsrWr3Maa	Lol they'll just continue your case to the officer's next court date.  Depending on the severity of the offense you were charged with, it's at the judges discretion.  Just go to court and take responsibility for your wrongdoing...pretty simple!<br>  What if the officer who charged you is one of the most dedicated professional officers in the department and his vacation is scheduled for June 15, 2013???  You cant put off a case for 4 years.<br>  Just go to court.|`|ftELrRJraa	Some information is public record.  Vacation dates and time are in that category.|`|nwMBfgcdaa	Cops are not always away on there vacation.  <br>  If I were the officer, i would tell you when my vacation was voluntarily.  Where I work, if you go to court on your scheduled vacation, you get double time and a half, plus another 12 hours off.  We get at least 4 hours for court (in our province you have to be paid for at least 4 hours if you are called out).  So 4 hours at double and a half is 12 hours.  <br>  Which means I end up with 24 hours pay, or 12 hours pay and another day off.  <br>  Plus, if I am on vacation and am away, the Judge has to accomdate me as well as you.  They will try to reschedule for a day both you and i can attend.  Most trials here are scheduled further than 45 days in advance.  I actually don't know when it would be too long, but definitely more than 45 days.|`|de221f92aeb3c79e0dde229966193ce0aa	I'll bet that the police department has somebody that watches the court calendar and will simply notify the court to change the date again. Wouldn't it simply be easier to obey traffic laws?|`|3yvuMkzTaa	Officers can give a sworn deposition to the judge before the trial, & not show up!!!|`|IW3jmnKbaa	I take it you haven't tried yet.<br>  So here's what you do, try it.<br>  The reason you have to be pushy is, they don't have a vacation chart hanging by the phone, they have to get off their butts and go look.<br>  Offer them a doughnut.

16F6Qf7Paa	You’re right thinking, that the financial crisis will get much worse. <br>  Igor Panarin is the dean of the Faculty "International Relations" at the Diplomatic Academy at the Ministry of the Foreign Affairs of Russia. <br>  10 years ago Panarin analyzed the main tendencies of the American economy  and came to the conclusion that the American economy will come to the recession, which will lead to the destroy of the country in 2009!<br>  He said it at September,9th, 1998 in  his speech(lecture) at the conference “The Informatics Wars”  in Leents, Austria.

I am waiting for the bailout because my company has to continue to exist, it is too big to fail.  I will be rich because I will pay myself a crazy amount and Obama will have to throw me a bone and bail me out. <br>  <br>  I think that Obama really thinks that he is doing right.  The problem is he is not following the blueprint that Reagan has set for him.  I really don't want him to fail because that is bad for all of us, but what happens if he succeeds?|`|AA12330998	Lets not forget, Clinton supported NAFTA, Bush started the Spending Spree and Obama is simply following suit.|`|ujIinLzGaa	Obviously.|`|a405fe6055a8e90eb60d333024ff3097aa	That is his plan.

He is grabbing power and that is all that matters to him. <br>  <br>  People are beginning to voice opposition to his agenda...there are many of us who want Obama and his policies to fail.<br>  <br>  <br>  ....Jesus Christ, shut up with the whining about race. <br>  Nobody really cares.|`|KeDuKdgCaa	Yeah - that's it...<br>  <br>  Because I took time off work to campaign for him singing "Burn Baby Burn"...<br>  <br>  Get real.<br>  <br>  I would HOPE that people like you could CHANGE their minds and start supporting our President to try to offer something to help America...<br>  Instead of just partisan attacking...<br>  <br>  Maybe I am just a dreamer.|`|i8EYcOoMaa	Some of it must be destroyed since it's nothing but a giant mafia of people who only seek their own benefit, exporting jobs to countries with no worker protections and using the fact that there are few regulations in place to milk the American worker dry.|`|bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	I see you have been memorizing Fox News again.*

I was stationed in San Diego California and we were allowed to go on our liberty.

For that trip I had to fill out an extensive travel plan and obtain permission from not only my command but higher authority. When I sought permission they gave me a travel packet and it had all the necessary forms to fill out.<br>  <br>  Going to Mexico wasn't that big of deal. We went on a Saturday afternoon and came back the same day. <br>  <br>  You  have to look at the local policy and find out if any country you want to visit has any travel warnings by the US Department of State and find out from your travel office or personnel office what to do. <br>  <br>  Every command will have different policies. For instance if you are on the Mexican border then you are more likely to have it approved than if you were in North Carolina.

She currently doesn't have the international expertise to be a viable candidate.<br>  <br>  I am an independent male.  Although I generally lean conservative (thus, old Republican) the latest Republican party has not been conservative.

48yMQt8Oaa	Yes it will help the economy as well as help those who need their homes updated and insulated. It will help the businesses that sell plumbing and electrical supplies. It will help the private contractors that are really hurting right now because of the housing market collapse but most importantly it will help the elderly. Part of the stimulus goes to weatherization of homes for the elderly and disabled. It broke my heart last year when one of our last remaining WWII heroes froze to death in his own home. How could that happen in our country? <br>  <br>  YES! It will help any bill that creates job and will increase aid to our elderly, disabled and our veterans is a good thing!|`|MEReSvZeaa	Not if 80% of Americans who can afford expensive home remodels have already taken advantage of tax credits in past years.<br>  <br>  A round of windows on your home will cost you $10,000 to $25,000.  You would never do that unless you had money to burn.<br>  <br>  A new heater will cost you less, but it's a pain and it's still expensive.<br>  <br>  Insulation is something everyone should do.  The only problem is that you have to tear out your walls to get it in.  I've got about 85% of my ceiling and walls completely sealed in with insulation and I've saved more in my utility bills than I ever could have in tax credits.  (Of course I took them anyway.)|`|AFqZEOlRaa	Sounds good to me.  <br>  <br>  And Hussein, got any sources for that?

That's a poor payback.<br>  <br>  Obama and I will spend $3000 on this stuff and I'll save $100/yr.  Not a good idea.|`|nYjVW8Fbaa	yes, but only on the surface, a 30% tax credit does not cover the cost of the long term debt and many will actually lose money because they will incure more in interest payments than the tax credit covers.

7pfCkrCzaa	So, Let's Recap-- 1. The American people elect a black president with a total of 142 days experience as a US Senator from the most politically corrupt state in America whose governor is ousted from office. The President's first official act is to order the close of Gitmo and make sure terrorists civil rights are not violated.    (He screwed up!!)2. The U.S. Congress rushes to confirm a black Attorney General, Eric Holder, whose law firm we later find out represents seventeen Gitmo Terrorists.     (An honest mistake!)3. The CIA Boss appointee, Leon Panetta has absolutely no experience, has a daughter Linda we find out, who is a true radical anti-American activist and a supporter of all the Anti-American regimes in the western hemisphere.    (There were socio-economic factors involved!)4. We got the most corrupt female in America as Secretary of State; bought and paid for.    (You can put lipstick on a pig, but it will still have cankles!) 5. We got a Tax Cheat for Treasury Secretary who files his own taxes.  (He misspoke!)6. A Commerce Secretary nominee who withdrew due to corruption charges.    (Another honest mistake???)7. A Tax cheat nominee for Chief Performance Officer who withdrew under charges.    (Hmmm...    another screw-up?)8. A Labor Sec'y nominee who withdrew under charges of unethical conduct.    (Ok,  maybe this person was just plain stupid)9. A Sec'y HHS nominee who withdrew under charges of cheating on his taxes.    (I'm running out of excuses for these idiots!!)10. Multiple appointments of former lobbyists after an absolute campaign statement that no lobbyists would be appointed.  (Dear God,  I need a drink!)And that's just the first three weeks. . . but who's counting?America is being run by the modern-day Three Stooges ~ Barrack, Nancy, and Harry ~ and they are still trying to define stimulus..."it's spending"...The congress passes the $800,000,000,000 (that's $800 billion) pork loaded spending bill where the government gives you a smidgen of your tax dollars ($13 per week) making you feel so good about yourself [stimulated] that you want to run out to Wal-Mart and buy a new Chinese-made HDTV and go home and watch Telemundo!Yee-haw!!! Only in America, what a country...We are lost...        Here's the good news though...    Obama is taking Air Force One to Denver to sign the stimulus package,  wasting as much as 10,000 gallons of fuel.      Don't you just love this guy? Jack Benstock  In these times "I'll keep my God, my freedom, my gun and my money. You can keep "THE CHANGE".|`|5YTkGB5yaa	I strongly disapprove.|`|rWdYBmPmaa	Disprove.

When you do you in processing with finance they should have you fill out a DA Form 5960 which is the for to start your BAH.  But, you have to have that rental agreement to prove your place of residence as BAH rates are based on where you live.<br>  <br>  Going in as an E-4 just means you'll make more money...and that always helps.  :)|`|ABmZYbDZaa	You will get BAH at the with dependent rate for an E4.

Because when we are facing the worst financial crisis in decades, it isn't time to try to subsidize "green" energy that wouldn't need a subsidy if it was feasible.  Why are we sitting on one of the largest proven oil reserves in the world. They are called the Bakken fields, or Bakken formation.  Look it up if you don't like my resources.  And if you want to listen to liberal arguments that say we can't get to it, or it isn't feasible, they are wrong.  I work in the oil industry, and every day I see opportunity squashed.  Think of the jobs we could create, while  lowering energy costs and creating revenue?  I'm all for "clean energy", but not until we can make it work.  I'm going to post a link in the sources.  Before you dismiss is as propaganda, please note that this is a U.S. Geological Survey report.  The lack of drilling in this country is not only stifling our economy, but propping up the economy of people who seek our destruction.  The sad part about all of this is that we are doing it out of purely environmental motivation,  based on "Global Warming" research which is controversial at best.|`|8Zpmm22raa	Easy,,,,,,Because you liberals are always screaming "it take 8-10 years to get a rig up and running."<br>  <br>  There is a glut of oil right now because the demand has dropped like a rock, in this bad economy.

Building oil rigs creates jobs.<br>  <br>  But fear not, the demand will increase again, after Obama gets recalled.|`|oTAPazvcaa	Because it will create more jobs, lower the cost per barrel, and get us out from under the Saudi's thumb.

We might as well start surveying for new wells now, since it takes time for those wells to start producing.|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	It takes years to bring in the oil.  It's not like going to 7/11 and getting a Slurpee whenever you want.  If and when Obama's massive spending starts up the economy, people will drive more and gas prices will rise, not to mention that currently we buy our oil from other nations which devastates our balance of payments.|`|rWdYBmPmaa	The more you have the lower the price.<br>  <br>  <br>  A better question is this, why did obama say when he was running he was for Nuke power and drilling off shore, and now he says no.<br>  <br>  I can answer that also, because he is a LIAR.<br>  <br>  And do people realize that oil is used for more than just fuel for cars. The plastic bottles for instance. Plus more.|`|AA11593971	It's called "energy independence." Why would you want America to be dependent on other countries for oil... especially when many of them don't like us or are unstable? <br>  <br>  It makes no sense, my friend to not DRILL BABY, DRILL.|`|e2926326f61b2becbde04426fcb444c8aa	They have never been well known for their intellectual powers.|`|AA11819105	Because we import 70% of our oil. we need to use our own oil and keep u.s. dollars here , and not in the hands of ones that will cause us harm|`|5hxWSezPaa	How short your memory is.  The idea is to drill when there is a surplus so that the oil is ready when there is a shortage.  If one waits until there is a shortage to drill that leaves you behind the curve.|`|be1979ce40b9ceceab7ad137e21ac660aa	Its there for now. What happens when the economy pics up again? If it ever picks up after your Messiah is done, of course we all want to drive around with a energy sucking battery in our trunk. How lame.|`|K1iUzewyaa	who did we over pay for the oil reserve?? why not drill here, create jobs here, we're capable of doing a far better job, with less environmental effects, higher standards..|`|oOUmH0Uyaa	Because we are looking to the future where our ability to be energy independent could mean the difference from all-out depression or an advantage over Asia and Europe, with whom we compete for these resources.|`|bzfXbM4raa	Well, you better drill, there's less than 10 years of oil reserves left in the U.S. at their current consumption.|`|AA11922229	More oil, more money.|`|Qih2hKqkaa	I'm proud of my very large "carbon footprint!"|`|fvN18yvGaa	Greed my friend, greed is what makes this merry go round of a country rotate...
PlbAp6eNaa	Well Im sure that the woman who was drunk will at the least get dwi and reckless endangerment, even though your mother was still fine. She would likely be told to pay an amount for damages sustained to your mother' car. As far as anything else, I would have to know more about the situation.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Your mom should contact her own insurance company, and they will handle it for her.  That's what you pay for.  <br>  <br>  I would hope that she would not join the ranks of sue-happy people, and fake some injuries to get a large settlement.  She should recover the cost of her car.|`|BUsMbbW1aa	Depends on where you live.<br>  <br>  Your mom should fake injuries and sue the girl for felony DUI.
SjTAVdcKaa	You still dont get it - Barry doesnt want to economy to get better. He wants power. For the feds & for himself. A miserable economy will draw more & more peole to dependf on the feds while pointing to capitalism as an utter failure. Thus enuring his & the lib-dems complete control.|`|RDQittNDaa	2 things:<br>  <br>  1. McCain admitted during his campaign that he was not economically savvy and would have to rely on advisors to help turn the economy around.<br>  <br>  2. The economy tanked long before Obama became President, he inherited it from Bush...if you truly think that the economy tanked overnight after Obama was elected you are a moron.|`|qRlPRJ1Jaa	He could start by keeping his campaign promises about earmarks and lobbiests. But he would rather take a pass and blame the omnibus on Bush. Truth is Bush refused to sign that bill because of the pork.  And now with our economy in the tank, he wants to provide health care to everyone which will cost more than the country can afford.  He wants to give everyone a college education even though we cannot afford that either. He seems determined to sink the ship, and even McCain cannot fix what hes done already.|`|pM81f5tnaa	And McCain would say, "The fundamentals of the economy are strong."|`|39KUKALFaa	Obama's plan is for social justice - not for recovery. Social justice requires that Americans live the same way and at the same standard of living as Kenyans do. As you will be aware Kenyan leaders are rich and everyone else is poor. This is only fair.<br>  <br>  It is social justice.<br>  <br>  Further, the Obama plan was written by the brains trust at the Central Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and it bears the seal of approval of Robert Mugabe. Your pointless capitalist attacks are so passe and stupid. We do not need prosperity. Obama will abolish it and you will be a better person for that.<br>  <br>  The second instalment of the Obama blueprint was provided by special adviser Pol Pot shortly before his death in Cambodia.|`|8l2IMrsFaa	No he would not since McCain's lifelong "conservative" friend is Phil Graham.<br>  <br>  It would be a mistake to ask John's help on economic matters.<br>  McCain has even said this in the past.|`|4qnXCxlHaa	What's it like to be able to get on the computer and log into Yahoo Answers in a junior high classroom?|`|SahUDTLnaa	Sorry crack has burnt his brain Up.  just telling it like it is.

Among the majority of Americans, no.|`|BUsMbbW1aa	If the stock market keeps dropping, yes.|`|7UqccTp6aa	Looks like it.|`|oTAPazvcaa	ding ding ding We have a winner!!!|`|t3QAaSN9aa	Wishful thinking on your part. FDR's approval ratings were high and he was elected to an unprecedented 4th term. The American people realized that although everything he did to try to get the country out of the Depression did not work, he was trying zealously to help the country.  FDR's lowest approval rating was 46%.  I use him as a comparison because Obama is in a similar position as far as the economy is concerned.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	This would indicate that his approval rating matches the DOW?<br>  <br>  When I was born in 1945 the DOW was 153 and the minimum wage<br>  <br>  40 cents an hour|`|lPwdDpxgaa	Probably, right before the global government he is pushing changes his title to Secretary of North American Affairs.  Then he will also hold the title of last US president.|`|4qnXCxlHaa	Based on what, kid?  Your opinion?<br>  <br>  I don't know if you've noticed, but Obama's approval ratings are at historical highs right now.|`|AA10604086	Will he become?????/  Sooner than you think.|`|SahUDTLnaa	You Betcha, Baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|7pfCkrCzaa	So, Let's Recap-- 1. The American people elect a black president with a total of 142 days experience as a US Senator from the most politically corrupt state in America whose governor is ousted from office. The President's first official act is to order the close of Gitmo and make sure terrorists civil rights are not violated. (He screwed up!!)2. The U.S. Congress rushes to confirm a black Attorney General, Eric Holder, whose law firm we later find out represents seventeen Gitmo Terrorists. (An honest mistake!)3. The CIA Boss appointee, Leon Panetta has absolutely no experience, has a daughter Linda we find out, who is a true radical anti-American activist and a supporter of all the Anti-American regimes in the western hemisphere. (There were socio-economic factors involved!)4. We got the most corrupt female in America as Secretary of State; bought and paid for. (You can put lipstick on a pig, but it will still have cankles!) 5. We got a Tax Cheat for Treasury Secretary who files his own taxes. (He misspoke!)6. A Commerce Secretary nominee who withdrew due to corruption charges. (Another honest mistake???)7. A Tax cheat nominee for Chief Performance Officer who withdrew under charges. (Hmmm... another screw-up?)8. A Labor Sec'y nominee who withdrew under charges of unethical conduct. (Ok, maybe this person was just plain stupid)9. A Sec'y HHS nominee who withdrew under charges of cheating on his taxes. (I'm running out of excuses for these idiots!!)10. Multiple appointments of former lobbyists after an absolute campaign statement that no lobbyists would be appointed. (Dear God, I need a drink!)And that's just the first three weeks. . . but who's counting?America is being run by the modern-day Three Stooges ~ Barrack, Nancy, and Harry ~ and they are still trying to define stimulus..."it's spending"...The congress passes the $800,000,000,000 (that's $800 billion) pork loaded spending bill where the government gives you a smidgen of your tax dollars ($13 per week) making you feel so good about yourself [stimulated] that you want to run out to Wal-Mart and buy a new Chinese-made HDTV and go home and watch Telemundo!Yee-haw!!! Only in America, what a country...We are lost... Here's the good news though... Obama is taking Air Force One to Denver to sign the stimulus package, wasting as much as 10,000 gallons of fuel. Don't you just love this guy? Jack Benstock In these times "I'll keep my God, my freedom, my gun and my money. You can keep "THE CHANGE".|`|4b9a85a6035089657723b2a7f272c834aa	He'll probably make it illegal to disapprove of him before that happens. Praise our benevolent leader, Comrade Obama!|`|U50orfPhaa	Yes!  Cause he wants to do what these guys want done!  Watch this video!|`|RDQittNDaa	No, in fact his approval rating is hovering over 70% right now...which is more than double what Bush's was in his last few months in office.|`|3OZoLNM2aa	nope, it wil never go lower than 31%. cause that is the number of blacks and hard core libs who will NEVER admit a mistake.<br>  <br>  along with the MSM|`|qRlPRJ1Jaa	I expect when his honeymoon period is over, he will sink to bottom of the charts.|`|pM81f5tnaa	Will Rush Limbaugh win the swimsuit competition?|`|juG7X5gyaa	I think you have hit the nail on the head!
2gx2LgzEaa	Lol<br>  <br>  Encourgement to continue what hes doing!!<br>  <br>  Bomb baby bomb!<br>  <br>  his ratings are going down faster then Rosie O'donnell on a twinkie|`|Zo9eWZrLaa	Your question shows that you listen to the democrat party talking-points being promulgated by the talking heads of the alphabet networks and propaganda network known as the "Mainstream Media."<br>  <br>  If you would listen to what Limbaugh actually said, it is quite different from what is on the MSM.  He wants Obimbo's POLICIES to fail, because if they succeed, we will become a socialist country and your rights under the Constitution will disappear.<br>  <br>  Rush is NOT the one causing Obimbo to fail.  Like you said, Obimbo is doing that ALL ON HIS OWN.  But is seems to be Obimbo's aim to blame Rush for something that Rush has absolutely no control over.  All the blame lies squarely on Obimbo.|`|8cd4e5f44ddf57a92d759bab9b6186d1aa	Because Obama's goal is to turn America into a European style socialist state. If he succeeds we will have a lower standard of living and fewer opportunities just like they do in Europe.<br>  <br>  Rush want's any effort to remake America into a society that is not based on Capitalism and individual rights to fail.<br>  <br>  Why echo the talking points of Obama's left wing administration?|`|EenbVs8Oaa	To save the country.<br>  <br>  I think we confuse with wanting him to fail at getting his policies passed, vs wanting his policies to fail.<br>  <br>  Count me in the camp that wants him to fail at getting them passed.  If they pass, I would think everyone would hope for the best, even if we have doubts.|`|qRlPRJ1Jaa	No one is pushing for obama to fail, they are pushing for his programs to fail before he bankrupts the country and officially turns us over to the communists.|`|axHyoVqGaa	He might be failing on his own, but we should be helping him along.  The sooner he is out of office the better!|`|SkLeo8C3aa	Okay okay. I get it.|`|SjTAVdcKaa	Not pushing. Just enjoying the inevitable.|`|FpMCFvV5aa	His socialist plans will succeed.  Failure for us is success for him.  He has been and always will be a Marxist.  Causing massive failure in our existing institutions along with the creation of new entitlement programs that are doomed to fail will facilitate his plans to make us all comrades in poverty.|`|5jYQbcHEaa	Because the rest of America don't believe in socialism!! We are hoping he fails because of his wrong beliefs.If we hoped for him to succeed then we would be for socialism but we're not.I wish people would get that through there heads don't you?We are not hoping that he fails as a president just his wacky beliefs.We are not for gun control,bigger government,socialism,    higher taxes,killing children(abortion),nationalized health care or robbing future generation out of their futures.Anyone who follows this man is for all of that and more.|`|HI73YeWWaa	When the college kids who voted for Obama graduate and discover there are no jobs because One Term Barry has destroyed the stock market along with the American economy, there will be a whole generation of new Republicans.|`|8Zpmm22raa	Because, if Obama succeeds, the country fails.|`|19da9b08442f9881cafe78b80940a57baa	There are many fanatics and crazy people in the U.S.|`|BUjcXhQ7aa	nothing wrong with a little "hope" is there?|`|c2hfVjxgaa	Oh..I didn't see the second part of your question so I have no beef with it.|`|MtFlPUyvaa	Because I do not want to live in Communist country (once again). Obama is a clown and even his failure will be mediocre. He needs help. We need to get rid of this socialist tumor once and forever.|`|EnODJeIcaa	I don't think anyone pushed for Obama to fail...I think people want to see the agenda that he is pushing be seen for what it is...a move towards big government and the slow march of nationalization...I think Rush was dead on with his point....he wants to see these policies fail and fail soon...because if it takes six years for the negative effects to show up.... then maybe Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid can point the finger at a Republican again....just like they have done with this economic crisis which was spawned by democrat sponsored legislation in the early 90's<br>  <br>  I want to see every man woman and child in this country achieve their dreams....everyone doing well will have a positive effect on society...and I don't want to see the country flounder into a depression.<br>  <br>  But I do want to see the Obama policies rear their ugly results sooner than later so there is no way for the democrats to obfuscate the situation and say that it is once again the Republicans fault...<br>  <br>  They count on the fact that people don't research their legislation...they count on the fact that people don't remember policy from a decade ago....they count on the fact that people in general don't remember the beginning of the subprime mortgage practice started in the late 90's after Chris Dodd started twisting banks arms to comply with FCRA regulations.<br>  <br>  And the lack of knowledge about the true results and the total faith in the facts of television has lead the people to put into power the very same people that caused the problem....kinda like calling an arsonist to put out a fire.<br>  <br>  I am on board with the fact that I want to see Obama fall flat on his face and I want to see the destruction that he is going to cause fall on his watch.<br>  <br>  Too often have democrats made policy with "good intentions" and loused things up horribly only to point the finger at Republicans...and the horde accepts their theories without finding thier own truth.|`|xbez1qBPaa	True. <br>  The idea is similar to the one the libs have been using for years now about the war: "I support the troops, but not the war." <br>  Well, now it's their turn: "I support my country, but not this president."<br>  <br>  Granted, he's gonna finally overreach himself and trip over his own big feet and huge mouth. I just want it to happen quickly so we can rebuild our heritage while we still have one.|`|eSGuZ5MFaa	we cant afford for him to be in power much longer ..he  has already cost us billions of dollars  ..maybe  he  will get the hint and go back to kenya...they love him over there..even claim he was born there and built a memorial  at his supposed birth place|`|SahUDTLnaa	God help us all should he succeed with his evil plots. There will be no more America, Period.

It is the congress that writes laws. The White House only executes them. He acts like he was not part of congress last year. Maybe he could say it is not his fault because once he was elected to the Senate he started running for President and he wasn't really part of that group.

Presidents usually steer clear of dispensing anything that sounds like an Oval Office stock tip, mindful that their very words can shake the global markets. <br>  <br>  <br>  Not on your life would I buy stocks.|`|m24wuDzwaa	Yes!

The very fact that people are talking about him right now and the fact that he has upwards of 20 million sheep listening to him every week is what makes him relevant.<br>  <br>  But yes, it is truly sad that the Grand Old Party is taking its cues from a two-bit, uneducated comedian. Can't they find a better spokesperson for their conservative "family" values than a hopped-up, thrice divorced former junkie who got busted for using Viagra without a prescription in the Dominican Republic (insert sexual innuendo here)?|`|FjehSe0laa	this country has already failed so has the previous Chief of Command it was announced that we were in recession before Obama even took office so for you all to make  statements like he is failing the country and creating a mess get real! some one was going to have the dirty job of cleaning up the mess that was already created I'm just hoping the decisions that are made pay off years from now for our sake<br>  <br>  No Limbaugh is not the GOP'S President in Exile,he is just a man with an opinion that does not really matter like the rest of us if his opinion was of any relevance President Obama would have never been elected|`|AA10659039	He is a self-appointed head of the conservatives.

Wake up, people...the attack against America and liberty is on in full measure, and you Obamabots are blindly allowing him to succeed.  Force your savior at least back to the political middle...force him to keep his campaign promise of transparency and bipartisanship.  We will all support him if he gives up the surge to socialize and neuter America.  But if he keeps moving left to border on Saul Alinski's manifesto of demise of capitalism, free-enterprise and the individual American spirit...rebellion will eventually ensure.  A new American revolution will occur...|`|AA11702773	Question it, publicize it, point out its consequences, fight it, and don't let people marginalize discussion of it.<br>  <br>  If you understand the trends of what is happening, you have a greater moral obligation than someone who doesn't understand.|`|Alkn6IJYaa	I am still waiting for any real evidence or proof that you guys are not making this all up.

9YOXpVM0aa	I am assuming the child lives in the US, if so, the child is a US citizen and the courts will normally side with the American citizen parent and try to avoid the child being taken out of the country.  If the American citizen parent was completely unfit and the illegal parent got full custody, the illegal parent could take the child whereever they want.|`|N7G26k4Iaa	Immigration status has nothing to do with parental rights.  Yes, the child is American but it is also a citizen of the father's country.  Now, US courts will probably side with a US parent and it would be difficult for an illegal to make their case, but if he wins full custody, he can take the child home with him.|`|OHfZFR31aa	If the child was born in the US to an American father, then the father can fight for custody. It's really up to the courts who gets custody - normally whichever parent can be shown to give the child a better life.|`|UiUPOA0laa	good luck, that was something that should have been thought about before doing things illegally.

C7FtRe69aa	Only 5 percent of Americans agree with Rush's statement that he hopes America fails. Actually, I do agree with his statement. He does hope that America fails. You made up statistic is completely bogus. Only 11 percent of the AMerican population supports Rush Limbaugh and few of those would agree with your statement. I know you Republicans are anti-schooling, but you can't be that bad with math. 11 percent hardly qualifies as "most Americans". In reality, it qualifies as a fringe group of fanatics.<br>  <br>  How can you call someone a patriot who boasts about how he hopes that America fails? Of course, you Republicans did run a VP candidate who advocates for the dismantling of the US, starting with Alaska and your party claimed that Hawaii really wasn't a state and therefore Obama wasn't really an American, so I big vocabulary words such as "patriot" must be really diffiicult for you guys, but I digress (look it up or ask an adult what that means).|`|AA11166769	You are hilarious!:) Rush Limbaugh is not only a rightwing blowhard, he's also a draft dodger.

I have never been a big fan of his until recently.  But I think that pretty much every person who is pro-Obama is either incredibly ignornant or deliberately an anti-American extremist.<br>  <br>  Edit: Sahara, Gov. Palin never said she could see Russia from her house, that was Tina Fey doing a parody of Sarah Palin.  Looks like Rush Limbaugh isn't the uneducated one here.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	Will you leftists just stop it with Rush already?<br>  <br>  What's with the lies, the falsehoods, the smears, the slurs and the propaganda?<br>  <br>  Let's discuss the doomed to failure presidency of Obama, based on his arrogant incompetency.|`|4qnXCxlHaa	ROFL!!!!<br>  <br>  You are not connected to the facts at all!!!!<br>  <br>  Among people under 40, Rush's approval is at 11 percent!!!<br>  <br>  11 percent!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=CF892DDC-18FE-70B2-A8417E6D9DABB37B" rel="nofollow">http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?u...</a><br>  <br>  How does that square with Fox News numbers?|`|oVmGcRVtaa	Rush the Lush did NOT serve in Vietnam, like little georgie bush and deadeye dick cheney they found a way out of serving there.

He wasn't the best president, neither was Bush....but Clinton was smart and he wouldn't be doing what Obama is doing now.<br>  <br>  I think it's funny these people that hate Rush. Hey, it's their right to and it's why they listen to him. Kind of like the Howard Stern affect....people tuning in to see what he'll say next.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	I don't think Rush is an anti-American. I didn't know that about him. He is a college drop out. He is not studious. He is not smart. He's a fat slob that happens to be an entertainer. He has loyal fans. He's not a politician or anything other than an entertainer. What is he an expert on? Government? With one college course? <br>  <br>  That's akin to Palin's absurd statement about seeing Russia from her house that makes her an expert on foreign affairs. <br>  <br>  To be an expert, you have to devote your life to study and live a life. You can't be so sheltered and just think - I want this and I will have it. <br>  <br>  Don't listen to Rush so blindly - so unquestioningly. He's a dufus.<br>  <br>  I used to listen to him.

The kinds of rants he's on now would have been called anti-American if done during Bush's tenure- in fact, Rush was one of those who called Bush Administration criticism anti-American. <br>  <br>  Rush has never fought for his country, has forged prescriptions, been on welfare and unemployment.

I'm pro-free speech.  The reason most people express a dislike for Limbaugh is that he offers no solutions.  When he says there is way too much welfare he's correct. But how does he propose we fix it?  When he says there is too much taxation he's correct.  But how else do you refund the treasury that  Georgie boy has bankrupted?

When Obama is re-elected in 2012 (after crushing Sarah Palin), he will be remembered the same way.<br>  <br>  "wife" has no clue about laws or history or anything else, and actually can't even spell.

And Democrats are trying to take advantage of that by tying an unpopular talk show host to an unpopular Republican party.  <br>  <br>  Talk radio as an industry is dying.  People are turning to other places for their news and entertainment, and it's only those crusty conservatives, those who don't want to give in to the "internets" as Bush put it, that are still clinging to talk radio.|`|I9FOycm6aa	Clinton was disgraced?

Check a chart of the DJIA or S&P 500 and you will see that the spiral actually started in oct. 2007. Over a year before Obama was even elected. In fact, well before anyone even believed he would win the democratic primary. Also are you not aware that the stock decline was precipitated by a credit crisis? Have you been living in a cave? Wall street banks lost their asses selling trillions in credit default swaps, paying the premiums recieved out to themselves as bonuses. and not reserving any for future losses. The source of the current economic crisis is well known to anyone who cares and knows how to read. Also if you check stock market charts even further back you will find that bear markets always accelerate dramatically as they approach a bottom. And by the way, the wall street criminals were only able to perpetrate their trillion dollar CDS fraud because of Bush administration deregulation. Previously not reserving for losses was illegal.

And by US census stats that is about 3% of US households.  And in most cases that increase would be about 3 to 4%.  So unless you fall into those categories (and 97% of the population doesn't) you will see NO tax increases from Obama.<br>  <br>  A far larger problem effecting a much larger portion of Americans is health care costs.  I received my Blue Cross Blue Shield letter last week.  Premiums are going up 22.1% (an almost $2,000 increase from last year) for me.  That's means I'll be paying over $12,000 a year for health care and the state insurance commissioner forecasts that health care costs will be over $20,000 per year by 2015.|`|6438e3eec8e381334263bc9aea173c89aa	This is funny.

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Yes. Capitalism was progressive say 500 years ago. Probably I repeat myself but for others this information might be new and it's crucial people start to understand<br>  <br>  Capitalism, and the imperialist system that develops upon its economic foundations, is the main cause of human poverty, exploitation, violence and suffering in the modern world. As a system of socio-economic organization, capitalism long ago exhausted its historically progressive role. The blood-drenched history of the twentieth century – with its two world wars, innumerable “local” conflicts, the nightmare of Nazism and other forms of military-police dictatorship, eruptions of genocide and communal pogroms – is an unanswerable indictment of the capitalist system. The number of victims claimed by capitalist-inspired violence runs into the hundreds of millions. And this figure does not include the consignment of the peoples of entire continents to unrelenting poverty, with all its attendant miseries.<br>  The gigantic scale of the existing productive forces and the extraordinary advances in technology are more than sufficient not only to abolish poverty but also to guarantee every human being on the planet a high standard of living. Culture should be flowering amidst unprecedented material wealth. But, instead, conditions of life are deteriorating for the working class, and human culture, deprived of perspective and hope for the future, is in deep crisis. The source of the contradiction between what is and what should be is a global economic system based on private ownership of the means of production, and the irrational division of the world into rival nation-states.<br>  All efforts to raise the living standards of the working class and address serious social problems run up against the barrier of private ownership of the means of production, the anarchy of the capitalist market, the economic imperatives of the profit system, and, last but not least, the insatiable greed and money-madness of the ruling class itself. The claim that the capitalist market is the infallible allocator of resources and the supremely wise arbiter of social needs stands utterly discredited amidst the endless series of speculative scandals and multi-billion dollar bankruptcies that have rocked the world economic system during the past decade. The boundary lines between “legitimate” financial transactions and criminal fraud have narrowed to the point of being almost invisible. The separation of the process of personal wealth accumulation from the production and creation of real value is an expression of the general putrefaction of the capitalist system.<br>  The solution to the spreading economic crisis and the deteriorating social position of the working class lies not in the reform of capitalism, for it is beyond reform. The crisis is of a systemic and historical character. As feudalism gave way to capitalism, capitalism must give way to socialism. The key industrial, financial, technological and natural resources must be taken out of the sphere of the capitalist market and private ownership, transferred to society and placed under the democratic supervision and control of the working class. The organization of economic life on the basis of the capitalist law of value must be replaced with its socialist reorganization on the basis of democratic economic planning, whose purpose is the fulfillment of social needs.<br>  While the economic system operates on a global scale, with industry and finance controlled by transnational corporations, capitalism remains rooted in a system of nation-states. In the final analysis, the national state serves as a base of operations from which the ruling class of each country pursues its interests on the world stage. The uncontrollable drive of the main imperialist states – including, first and foremost, the United States – for geo-political dominance, spheres of influence, markets, control of vital resources, and access to cheap labor, leads inevitably to war. The doctrine of “preventive war” unveiled by the Bush administration in 2002 – in violation of legal precedents established at the Nuremberg war crimes trial of 1946 – legitimizes war as an instrument of policy and sets the stage for unending and escalating violence.<br>  <br>  EDIT Capitalist apologists now say capitalism didn't fail but instead government intervention is the reason it got nowhere. That claim is absurd. Without the bourgosie government and its intervention including the central bank there would be no free makret to begin with. They preach a gospel of utopian capitalism that never was and never will be unless you accept purely capitalist solutions such as child labor and slavery as well. Both those practices are illegal because of government restrictions on the market|`|vZy28Yqjaa	Capitalism isn't a failure, it's freedom. Self serving, unbridled greed and power are what brings societies down no matter the system. Our society took a wrong turn when we began to encourage and celebrate bad behavior and confuse it with success, success became synonymous with screwing everyone else to get ahead, that's not capitalism at it best, but rather at it's worst.  Our system has provided more opportunity to succeed than all others combined, don't fault the system.|`|KeDuKdgCaa	I've always just kind of liked our system in America (the way it's supposed to work) and have the most hopes for that.<br>  <br>  We have a blend of capitalism balanced with certain amounts of socialism.

2a9MLpZRaa	One that changes with the popular opinion of decent and moral behavior.  One that promotes prosperity.  One that best serves the needs of people that are in it.  I know that there is no such thing as an ideal society "in the end", so I just hope society as a whole functions to do those three things.|`|2b9d44a2626e8bffeebd493f9eb0199eaa	Essentially an ideal society is one where mankind works in a way that aims to bestow on society, instead of our current society that is based on the principle of "everyman for himself" and "survival of the fittest."<br>  <br>  If you examine the track record of the govenrment - and this is no specific criticism of Labour beacause the things I will highlight would have happened under the Tories and the Lib Dems - they have failed to deliver on so many of their promises. They promised a reduction in the gap between rich and poor - the opposite has happened. Riches are still in the hands of the few, not the the many. Child poverty, we were reliably informed, would be gone, nothing of the sort has happened. We have a govenrment that have landed the country in a recession because they failed to regulate the financial markets in a way that would be beneficial to the people, instead they sided with the businessmen at the expense of the taxpayer and look at the mess were in because of it.  <br>  <br>  But all of these things boil down to one thing. They highlight the fact that we simply don't care nearly - if at all - for each other. If we adopted a policy where we looked after each and every member of our society, as much as we do for ourselves then we would have a beautiful country - make that a beautiful World  if it was adopted globally. If we actually cared for our fellow man then we could stop wasting money on arms and we could eradicate poverty and hunger in a blink of an eye. Instead we have a world full of hate, violence, crime, exploitation, excess and injustice.  <br>  <br>  In order to create a better society we must first change our egoistic nature.

This won't be as dangerous as if you were in the infantry, but it isn't risk free either.<br>  <br>  I don't want to put you off, but bear in mind that you are volunteering to be a soldier. you will carry a gun for self defence and defence of patients. You need to consider what happens if you can cope with active service. Good Luck.
9XJLlPaEaa	Depends what you want to sue for, and the agreement is evidence in court, so you can take them to court.|`|AA11622716	Assuming you want to sue for breach of contract, in most cases the existence of a contract can be proved by testimony and no writing is necessary.  Whether that testimony will be believed is another question.  Some types of contracts must be in writing in order to be enforced.  Most commonly, a contract to create an interest in real estate must be in writing.

Q4sadroEaa	USAF has the highest standards, but every branch has jobs that require a high asvab score. if your trying to pick a branch based on asvab score standards dont. find a job you like and see what branch of the military has it then go there.|`|GgG0inaUaa	It just depends. The link will help.|`|9xltuXkiaa	i dont know for sure.. but i agree with the first answer here.. <br>  <br>  USAF has the BEST people service.   Frankly amongst the services it treats its people BY FAR the best of any service.. this may be a side effect of the officers owing their very lives to the enlisted that maintain their planes.. .. reducing the "crappy officer attitude towards enlisted".. It really pays off for air force enlisted.<br>  <br>  this means that the USAF can pick and choose amongst applicants.. there will NEVER be a shortage.  Also there wont be many AF on the front lines "en mass" like there is in the ground forces.  <br>  <br>  The navy needs high tech people as bad as the airforce but.. the navy is by far the WORST people service there is.. where i wouldnt be suprised if the navy guys exceed 2x the actual hours spent on the job for any other service  with only the coast guard coming close to that.   as a result the navy atrition rate is much higher than the other services as probably is the divorce rate.  so the navy must sacrifice entrance requirements to keep manning up to acceptable levels.  (navy ships require manning 24 hours a day, every 3rd or 4th day is 24 hour work days.. followed by a normal workday.. only exception is deployed where your stuck on the tin can for 24/7.. )  (additionally the Navy stands it's own watches.. ie you work a 40 hour week.. then you have "watches" and duties outside that normal work week.. net result is  you can work 2x as long as any other service in hours on the job probably much more in hours on the job site.)<br>  <br>  the marines and army you can DIE.. especially if you have a war mongering neocon president who only cares about corporate profit not lives especially one who's lack of respect for the service was clearly demonstrated by his own wartime desertion.<br>  <br>  so since you can DIE.. in some forign land .. for haliburtions and exxon mobiles profit margins.. many people with higher asvab scores wont join those services.. <br>  <br>  thus the lowered standards there too...<br>  <br>  in summation my guess is the USAF has the highest standards and gives out the fewest exemptions from those standards of any service.|`|SJr2tYeTaa	I think the USAF has the highest standards<br>  <br>  But there are people in all branches that scored high on the ASVAB<br>  <br>  I decided to join the USMC before taking the ASVAB and my score qualified me for any branch<br>  <br>  Mike,  I also attended MCRD San Diego.

Gezfmghuaa	You didn't say which state, so laws may vary, also without knowing what the disability is can make a difference as well.<br>  <br>  In general, employers are required to provide reasonable accomodation for disable workers.  But the worker must also be able to do the job with those modifications.<br>  <br>  As an extreme example, someone who lost use of both arms will not be giving tennis lessons, regardless of accommodation.<br>  <br>  If your employer determines you will not be able to perform your usual tasks and does not have an equivalent position you can do, then they have the right to ask you to accept a lesser position if applicable or let you go.<br>  <br>  There's a secondary issue here as well.  If the disability existed when hired and was a material factor in the decision to employ (i.e. if you had told them they would have had a reason to deny employment or if it would make a substantial difference in the cost of employment), they could terminate you for not providing the info.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	Of course not thats discrimination. And you have been doing the job for a year? them im sure you are obviously perfectly capable of doing the job.|`|GHD8JicSaa	If you had the disability before you started working for them and failed to disclose it, then you were hired under false pretenses.  Yes,  they can fire you.  The Americans with Disability Act does not protect you from illegal acts or making false statements.   <br>  <br>  However if your disability is new and has come up since you started working for them then you are fully protected under the American's with Disabilities Act.   <br>  <br>  Did you lie or not?|`|QP62szAuaa	Did they ask if you had one on your original application or at your interview?  If so they can fire you for lying.|`|eC9SkM04aa	what's your disability?

XhexwM1faa	The president appoints the head man, and the senate must approve of him by majority vote. This is the case with all government bureaucracy's. The department of homeland security is specifically an independent agency in the same mold as the FBI or the CIA. They are not a regulatory agency, as they don't regulate anything related to business. Their job is to seek out domestic terrorists like the leaders of the 911 plot. I think of this department (which was established in 2002) as the FBI on steroids.
62998c1eb5a3f349422d1d49f36b44e8aa	There is no "national cost" for the death penalty, unless you mean Federal death penalty. Each state assumes the costs associated with having the death penalty in their state.<br>  <br>  It also depends on what you want included in the cost. Death penalty cases cost more to prosecute, so those costs are usually rolled in, as well as the costs of appeals, housing on death row, etc. <br>  <br>  One source for good information on death penalty costs is here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-de...</a><br>  <br>  But don't let anyone fool you, the costs of having the death penalty outweigh the costs of not having it.|`|8e35cfeded3c3b900607388410347b4caa	Less than the cost of keeping the reprehensible scumbags alive and incarcerated.|`|dAsrWr3Maa	A lot freakin' cheaper then holding the scumbags in prison for the rest of thier lives.

You should be fine.  They might get a kick out of it if they do check your bag but more than likely they won't even check.
GHD8JicSaa	Your ex husband will get the settlement due to him even if in jail.  He may not be able to spend any of it until he gets out of jail but the money from the settlement is his as he was injured at work.<br>  <br>  Your son will not get any "funds due to him" because he was not the one hurt at work.   The only way you are going to get anything for your son is to sue your ex-husband (assuming he is the father of the kid) for increased child support due to his receiving the settlement.  However that is iffy, as under Iowa law a settlement for an injury is not considered "income" and you may not be able to get any of that.   <br>  <br>  It is quite likely your ex will get out of jail,  have a bunch of money from the settlement and be able to spend it the way he wants and your son will get nothing more than just the previously ordered child support.|`|Gezfmghuaa	Unclear here, is the settlement to your husband or to your son.  If the settlement is due to your husband it will be covered under the terms of your divorce agreement, the probation/jail has no effect on that.  If your agreement does not address it, and he is current on his obligations, the settlement payment is his to keep.<br>  <br>  <br>  If the settlement payment goes directly to your son it should also not be affected.|`|AA10529198	Yes.

Jm3vMKx3aa	To realize the travel plans two visa are required; one Schengen visa valid for Spain and Malta and a visa valid for Turkey. It is not that much dependent on how long she has stayed in the United Kingdom on her student visa but on how long her student visa will still be valid after return from her journey to the beforehand named countries to the United Kingdom. Spain will not accept a visa application if she does not have an authorized stay of at least six month in the United Kingdom after the Schengen visa has expired. Turkey will take a visa application if the authorized time of stay in the United Kingdom is less than 6 months; in this case however the decision about a visa is not made at the London Embassy which will take 3 days but will be referred to the relevant Turkish authorities for approval which generally takes minimum 6 to 8 weeks to finalize.

ZdjfGjzIaa	That are many ways, depending on many factors and different strategies.  This also depends on what the objectives are...do we want wipe the army off the face of the planet or just make them retreat, etc.  Air bombing, infantry, Naval bombardment (cruise missiles), special ops tactics, and information warfare..|`|GHD8JicSaa	Retaliation for the sake of retaliation is stupid.<br>  <br>  Example.<br>  <br>  In WW Two the Germans Air Force had the British on the ropes.  It was only a matter of time before the RAF fell and the Germans could invade.  <br>  <br>  But then a German air mission to bomb the ship docks in London missed and hit the center of London.<br>  <br>  Air Marshall Harris,  the head of the BBC ordered a 1000 plane raid on Berlin in retaliation.   No military target,  just hit the city.  <br>  <br>  That pissed Hitler off so much he ordered the Germany Air Force to hit London and other cities.   No military targets,  just hit the cities.<br>  <br>  That gave the RAF time to rebuild and eventually fight off the bombers.  The RAF remained in intact and eventually Hitler called off the invasion of England.<br>  <br>  And from that point onwards, the BBC kept bombing German cities.  No military targets,  just hit the cities.   <br>  <br>  Rather than attacking strictly military targets and factories,  both sides wasted their assets in retaliation,   thus prolonging the war.<br>  <br>  Air Marshall Harris did not get much recognition after the war because down deep,  everyone felt he was wrong but would not admit it.<br>  <br>  Retaliation is stupid.   Keep hitting military and strategic targets if you want to win.

0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	I think some of it may be. His budget proposal and his recent decision to take over partial ownership of Citibank is causing quite a stir in the country. Not only for the rich, but for everyone. A lot of what Pres. Obama does is not sitting well with the majority of Americans...regardless of whether they are Republicans or Democrats...or Independents such as myself. I have some very grave concerns over how his policies might affect our standard of living. Even though the majority of tax increases will affect the very rich more than the everyday person, the cost of the proposed programs far exceeds the ability for the rich to pay for it all...even if he taxed them at 100%. One way or another, you and I will be affected as well. It may not come in the form of income tax or payroll tax, but eventually it will affect us somewhere down the line. That is the reality....even if it is not his desired outcome. Our country already sustains a lot of social programs via the government and it has only been with the help of non profits that other social programs have been possible. With the new tax laws he proposes, those non profits will be receiving a lot less money...therefore those programs will go down the tubes. This will only make it necessary for government social programs to pick up the difference..and that means higher costs to the taxpayer. This is just plain common sense. My only hope at this point is that congress will see the reality and not pass the budget as written...but even there, I am not holding my breath.|`|LJwhaNIDaa	Yes. <br>  <br>  Because many businesses are owned by middle class people, not the uber wealthy. <br>  <br>  Also, anyone who has read the fine print of Obama's spending plan realizes that many less wealthy business owners will be effected economically by Obama's spending plan. <br>  <br>  In addition, the less wealthy business owners are intelligent enough to see the handwriting on the wall.  Hence they realize that EVERYONE'S  taxes will need to be raised in order to support Obama's reckless spending spree.|`|FdZtCnwhaa	Yes, most with large amounts of money are scared and hiding it.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	No, it is a result of the Bush years preceded by the Reagan years.|`|AA12203329	Well duh....ok just give me a second here to vent.Mr. O is raising taxes on the wealthy...who owns the company's in our country..lets just say the wealthy(no poor man has ever hired me) What happens to this guy already is ridiculous in this country, he's regulated and taxed to the tune of some 40% already then along comes the new pres and his band of shake down artist and they want even more of his earnings what would you do?

7f1TfskEaa	Promotion to MAJ has become nearly as automatic as 1LT to CPT.  The Army is short MAJs.  Too many CPTs were getting burned out on repeated deployments and leaving.  Last year the Army was offering CPTs $10k or more to stay in.  They were also looking at incentives like choice of duty station or 'guaranteed' dwell time.  Active Duty was also promoting CPTs to MAJ one year early to fill the vacancies.<br>  <br>  2LT to 1LT is as automatic as it gets.<br>  1LT to CPT requires completion of an Officer Basic Course<br>  CPT to MAJ requires completion of a Captain's Career Course<br>  (somewhere in there is a requirement for a Bachelor's degree, but I always seem to run into a CPT and even a couple of MAJs who never completed their degree)<br>  <br>  I have heard of CPTs being promoted to MAJ with a GOMR (General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand) on their record.  This was unheard of 10 years ago.<br>  <br>  [edit]While in Iraq, the Division Commander met with EVERY Captain that had not agreed to stay in the Army.  The lack of a Bachelor's degree has always been on the National Guard side.|`|8454b08cd94e39ec6f1c2eb2f2b07a68aa	I agree with airborne and Ray...but even though Major slots seem more available these days, a Captain still has to meet military and civilian education requirements. And have good OERs. I haven't run into what Mark B says about getting promotions without advanced degrees and red flags in one's file...I'm in the reserves so maybe things are different with Active Duty.|`|67ThRN4Taa	I've been retired for going on nine years so my information is dated.  But it was my understanding that 99% of 2LTs made 1LT, 95% of 1LTs made CPT, and 50% of CPTs made Major.<br>  <br>  I retired almost a year before 9/11.  I'm guessing that in a situation like this, where we're fighting a war in two different theaters, the personnel situation, to include promotions, works differently.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	Yeah, airborne is dead on... it's gotten to the point where you can pick up a lot of rank (in both sides of the house) by just being willing to stay in and not horribly screwing up.|`|lrhYYM55aa	Well what do you mean. Sergeant major. which takes about 20 years. to up hold that title. Sometimes longer.|`|TXXVaoLNaa	be good at kissing *** and politics|`|JIwbiE8kaa	Here is the deal...none of those ranks are automatic.  Although the success rate is very high, I have seen some not make it.  If there were problems...spousal abuse...those things you will not make it.  To your question, the promotion rate for MAJ is close to 98%...pretty high.  The reason is simple, there are so many people getting out at CPT that the ones who stay in are needed to fill the MAJs jobs.

Otherwise, no, no one who actually knows what communism is, including the American Communist Party, thinks Obama is a communist.<br>  <br>  None of the things you talk about have anything to do with communism.  Raising taxes has nothing to do with communism.  I wish people would stop using words they can't understand.  I wish Republicans would stop making problems and then attacking anyone who tries to come up with a solution.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	No. And it's obvious TGIfrees doesn't know what communism is.  In communism there would be no "rich" to be taxed more heavily, because in communism, everyone is equal in income and all business is run by the collective.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	Well, it certainly doesn't seem compatible with the Constitution of the United States of America.|`|3eb0DIxGaa	Scare, boo, scare. No, he's  just more for the citizens than neocons are. Need proof? Look at the economy Bush left us with. He was even too chicken to fund the wars in his budget requests, and Repubicans let him do it. <br>  <br>  Obama's agenda? Save America for we, the people, not the criminals, and their agendas that were thrown from office in the last election.|`|gr6e1WZEaa	The way our government has been working has made us the strongest nation in the history of the world. Now we starting down a new path as you so brilliantly explained. Obama was elected on emotions without reason and the Kool-aid drinkers still think it o.k. to give up liberties to re-distribute wealth to them from people who did what was necessary to obtain wealth.|`|uVggUDWNaa	If your so afraid that the Obama "Bolsheviks" have taken power, maybe you should shut your mouth before they send you to the Gulag|`|oAWEcd5Qaa	The substance of your statement is correct,The communist part is wrong.Obama has no agenda,it is a mission.In 2002 the worlds strongest leader,with the most support,stated.We don't need planes to take out America,we will do it from the inside.The search began to find a closet Muslim,that would pass all investigations.It was clear that Bush was loosing popularity,so entertaining a segment of America's population that would take on the role of a sheep,following the desires to get Bush out,regardless of qualifications.Money was poured in this campaign from American Muslim organizations and foreign figures to make sure this man was elected.Obama is doing a great job of completing his mission set forth for him.All his blind followers will see this in less than a year but the mission will be complete by then.The liberals will see this as a joke.But maybe one may do some investigations with an open mind.|`|d83d9da8709343b3aaed98bd340e3ba5aa	A little lesson in Communism:<br>  Any thing that the Government subsides is communism.<br>  Your sugar, milk,vegetables etc are subsidized so you are part of a communist system from long before Obama came into office.<br>  Your sugar is one of the highest subsidized item in America and the stinking rich sugar barons are not crying communism for they are laughing to the bank while they are the same people would shouting no to communism. They know how to manipulate the small minds.|`|zm5RYyVHaa	Just turn on the tv or listen to the radio, it's right before your eyes. These idiots  answering your question need to school up on what communism/marxism/socialism/totalitarian is. When you try to put forth an amendment regulatiing the first amendment, something's wrong.|`|2d69936105356d8f89d5fc8b636de857aa	everything you just listed are proven lies and if you would simply open up that mind of yours and let some facts sink in instead of just your narrow minded untruths then you would see that and at the same time you might actually learn something. please get your facts straight.|`|C2HHfun2aa	I am not so sure I would say communist but it is Socialist. The Obamunists will say your crazy or stupid but hey they are so busy chanting the mind numb hope and change mantra that are clearly not thinking and will only wake up when some of their freedoms have been taken away of course by then it will be too late.|`|vVBydMpiaa	It's not Obama's agenda.<br>  <br>  Hate to tell you but Obama don't run anything.<br>  Stop getting mislead by the shiny objects they put in front of us to distract us.|`|PtHThRoNaa	No I don't but I do feel as though one quarter of our country has gone completely nuts.  You would be included in the one quarter.  Have a nice day.|`|9epL6qjBaa	I love how Sassy and Adam can do the snarky comment.  Typical response of un-informed Libs who can't find their butts with both hands when debating the issues.<br>  <br>  The Obama tax hikes also include new restrictions on itemized deductions for families that earn more than $250,000 per year. Deductions for things like charitable donations, mortgage interest and investment expenses will be capped at 28 percent for the wealthiest taxpayers, some 30 percent less than they currently get. <br>  <br>  By 2020, taxpayers in the wealthiest households will pay $636.7 billion in additional taxes according to estimates in the budget proposal. <br>  <br>  The changes would be phased in gradually over the next few years, according to an analysis of the budget by the Wall Street Journal. For the 2009 tax year, the 33 percent tax bracket starts with couples with adjusted earnings of $208,850. A taxpayer in the top bracket paying $1,000 of mortgage interest, for example, would see a tax break worth $350 reduced to $280. <br>  <br>  According to estimates from Deloitte Tax, a married couple with 2 children under age 17 and income of $500,000 a year would owe approximately $11,300 more than under current law if all of the tax provisions in Obama's budget request outline were enacted, CNN reported. <br>  <br>  The remainder of the $1 trillion tax hike would come from $353.5 billion in additional levies on businesses, especially U.S.-based multinational corporations. Obama’s proposal calls for significantly rewriting the rules on the taxability of profits earned overseas, increased enforcement of international tax collections and changes in accounting that would serve as a “windfall profits tax” aimed largely at the oil companies. <br>  <br>  "This budget plan is once again a missed opportunity for American taxpayers — it raises taxes on all Americans, implements massive new spending and fails to make any tough choices to control the deficit," Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., the top Budget Committee Republican, told the Associated Press. Gregg was nominated by Obama to join his Cabinet as commerce secretary but later withdrew.|`|XdlVam6Uaa	no. in fact i get the feeling he is afraid to take certain actions for fear of being labled a socialist. he is absolutely afraid of that socializing the banks, even if it helps us out of our recession, would cost him the next election because of idiots like you.|`|6YADkFr7aa	I think he trying to get us out of the slump were in and is getting to much advice. Your right to a certain point but the plan is to break us and the U.S split apart like the russians|`|JV75Iz3eaa	Pretty much, yes.  He has plenty of useful idiots to further his agenda.|`|VG4r3miJaa	Well, not should if it is working under the definition of Communism, but it is most certainly Socialism, communism's lil brother.  People have to open there eyes and see what's really going on.<br>  <br>  There are so many politically ignorant people.  They think they know what the hell they are talking about, but don't have a clue.  It is amazing how these people behave.  They are always saying stuff like "why is that so bad" and "The rich have to much money" then they start to whine.<br>  <br>  When are people going to realize that for the most part the rich are rich because they took risks and succeded.  This probably came after multiple failures, but have learned from there mistakes.<br>  <br>  I myself right now had a daughter 11months ago and I'm forced to live at home cuz the state takes about $800 a month in child support (even though I deserve to have my daughter full time)  I don't cry to mom that John down the street is in a better situation than me.<br>  <br>  There is so much class envy it makes me sick.  People should concentrate on themself and only then maybe they will see what true freedom is.  <br>  <br>  Obama is nothing but a socialist and it crushing America and everything it stood for.  Capitolism is great and is what this country was built on.  Not only that, but it provides for the most feedom for the individual.<br>  <br>  Markets need to rise and fall on their own.  Daddy Government will only make things worse in the long run if they try to create an artificial bubble.  People need to get away from this entitlement mentality and relize they are suseptable to some hardships in life
WiFQbtgIaa	Yes, for a start.<br>  <br>  "We contend that for a nation to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handle. " -- Winston Churchill<br>  <br>  But Obama will continue trying until he does this ...<br>  <br>  "The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings; the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries." -- Winston Churchill<br>  <br>  It's no wonder The Obama sent back Winston Churchill's bust to England form the Oval Office.|`|UdERC367aa	I lean left, but that doesn't make me illogical and irrational.  We need balance and balanced ideas from both left and right - for the good of the people and the country.|`|03ef1467aed1253e530bac3b2891149caa	Extremists from both sides are illogical and irrational.|`|AA11530144	If there was no logic  or rationale in it, why are so many rightwing business people terrified by it?|`|PdZ9ZYixaa	Just as much as the right is illogical and irrational.|`|AQep0wRvaa	The left is so illogical and irrational in their thinking...<br>  <br>  1.

PS6Pjtndaa	This is just ONE example of how we as a nation have lost our way.  The founding fathers believed it was vitally important to keep most decisions at the state level.  Very little governing was to be done by the federal government.  It was all about states' rights!<br>  <br>  But modern day federal government (and I mean for decades now!) has tied strings to federal monies.  You want our highway dollars?  Lower your highway speeds.  You want our educational dollars?  Change your standards!<br>  <br>  So, yes, OF COURSE this is a power grab.  My only point is that it's nothing new.|`|wdz5RMaeaa	yes, the Constitution is quite clear about state's rights. Dems' "platform" is Fed control.<br>  <br>  Everyday is getting more amazing. It's like a blitz attack.|`|f0bb213732f5c2ceb3db8c6b3def0573aa	The tenth amendment to the constitution does not permit the federal government to do what they are doing.
m0muVAXfaa	LOL that would be like putting a turd in the punch bowl! It was like the tech bubble, the last thing investors wanted was someone throwing a wet towel on their party. Of course you are right, It was the Bush Administration's job to be the watchdog of the financial markets. Greenspan made mention (your irrational exuberance reference) of this and was almost run out of town on a rail by the traders on wall st. and the talking heads on TV. Sadly regulation of the markets was the opposite of what the Bush cabal wanted, they were the proverbial foxes in the hen house. Risk was removed from mortgage trade and greedy banks all jumped into the feeding frenzy.|`|0440336faf3bbaada17aec78b1b564b2aa	Irrational exuberance (in one's investment portfolio) leads to a hard crash when things turn bad and the inevitably do.  Reverse irrational exuberance leads to never making any significant gains.  Smart people avoid both pitfalls.|`|f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	Yeah, but everyone was too busy gloating and the rest were too high or simply too clueless.
8quTABk6aa	I think that's an interesting point.  I often find that I stop listening to an individual or group once they become obnoxious.<br>  <br>  Here's an interesting analogy.  Public support for the Vietnam War had dropped to seriously low numbers.  Anti-war protestors began doing things that were anti-business, anti-establishment, and flat out rude & cruel (i.e., organizing wide spread call out of work days, etc.).  By doing these things, they strengthened the resolve of their zealot core but isolated the mainstream.  <br>  <br>  Bottom line:  don't insult the majority to strengthen your minority.|`|CM1dfztQaa	Facts are facts, and no amount argument can change them. Some will always defend him, simply because they don't know any better. Others will begin to see the realities of the situation as time goes on. I predict that his ratings will continue to fall and he will be the lowest rated president in US history.|`|wdz5RMaeaa	I don't believe the criticisms are personal, - even personal as to his abilities. The criticism is is basically about the $$$$$$$$, and the admitted fact that not a whole lot of people know what they are doing. <br>  And he campaigned promising what he can't/won't deliver.<br>  <br>  Libs, - part of their nature I believe,  is to be overly sensitive, - especially to the truth which may hurt.<br>  <br>  Over the past 4 years, there have been more conservatives than expected to be disappointed in Bush's performance. . They will admit it. Me too. <br>  <br>  Admitting doubts is just not the lib way.
jEqISBnQaa	So that The Pimp can, once again, pretend that he's running things when, in fact, things are running him. In this case, it's Congress that's running things. In the form of Pelosi, Reid, Boxer, Schumer, Dodd, Frank, Waxman, Conyers, and all the rest of the retreads from the 1960s.|`|DLvHWOo7aa	Can you list even one?|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	This is a particularly good example of Obama's doubletalk.  He is a creep.|`|G49lKR56aa	Who says liberals are fair? Anything and everything they can push off onto Bush is fair game, in their minds!
PS6Pjtndaa	FACTS:<br>  <br>  The Mortgage Meltdown:<br>  <br>  1. The media fed the frenzy of skyrocketing home prices by REPORTING ad nauseam the skyrocketing home prices, the quick flips that made tens of thousands of dollars, etc.<br>  <br>  2. Greed fed this frenzy as well.  Everyone wanted to cash in on the quick buck!<br>  <br>  3. STUPIDITY fed the frenzy as well.  Let's say you're in Marin County, CA.  You want in on the housing boom?  Well, when you're faced with having to get into a BIDDING WAR with 5 or 6 other families for a 1,000 SF 1950 bungalow in fixer up condition and you see the price skyrocketing to over a million dollars then ... well, c'mon!  Are you serious?  But I saw it played out hundreds of times!  What did these idiots expect?<br>  <br>  4. The government did in fact legislate that banks loosen their lending practice standards.  You can put it all on predatory lenders if you like and stupid borrowers.  There's blame there too, but the government played a hand in it!  <br>  <br>  5. The government also make interest deductible on your home.  It made it like ... hey, the more I borrow, the more I pay in interest, the more I can write off.  Pretty smart, eh?<br>  <br>  6. Yes, the mortgage companies did come up with utterly ridiculous schemes and scams to get more and more people into homes, often ones they could not afford!  They offered and the idiots accepted!<br>  <br>  The people are protesting the government because they are SUPPOSED TO BE REPRESENTING OUR WILL!  Most honest hard working Americans don't want these damned handouts!  SOMEONE has to pay for them!  It's OUR MONEY!  And Obama and company have EXPLOITED the shakey economy to ram through immoral and unConstitutional legislation that has NOTHING to do with economic stimulus!  STD prevention?  PLEASE!  Assistance for hookers?  C'mon!  Making poor people's homes greener?  Are you kidding me?<br>  <br>  As P.J. O'Rourke said all of those years ago: Congress is like drunken sailors!  <br>  <br>  Here's the duplicity of your question.  YOU SAY that businesses and individuals caused this problem.  Okay?  BUT ... Government is BAILING THEM OUT!  Whatever happened to the saying that you reap what you sow?  We don't want to bail out idiots!  It's not the will of the people!  Chrysler makes bad cars!  Chrysler gives crappy customer service!  I say they succeed or fail on the merits of their ability to succeed or fail.  The Government should not bail them out!  <br>  <br>  That's why we are protesting the government!  A homeowner makes bad decisions and loses his home, we feel sorry for him.  The government buys him a home and we get mad!|`|AA10329269	You can't be serious. The government is the root cause of the country's current problems.

eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	It's the result of a combination of neediness instead of self reliance and a hunger for power over others.

When policies are aimed at women in the home the are targeted by people with certain ideas towards keeping them there and when they are taxed by the husbands salary its a cruel act because it creates a disincentive for the woman to recieve and denigrates her as an independant purely to clawback revenue for the state.|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Your reference to a horrible movie where every third minute one of the characters comes out of the closet and use of vocabulary shows that you must REALLY know what you're talking about.|`|hTFalwX6aa	POWER AND CONTROL<br>  <br>  Power - those dependent VOTE Democrat<br>  Control - you control those dependent on you<br>  <br>  AND CRUEL|`|GOpDGnsXaa	History read it its about control.<br>  Study Fabians.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	It's not dependency; that's just con rhetoric.  The idea is that a government that is supposedly of the people should be working in the interests of the people whom it represents. It is con ideology that tries to alienate the people from their own government in order to use it as a entity that only represents the interests of the favored few.  We are taking our government back and making sure that it works in all of our interests.|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	Some dependence on the government is totally unavoidable - nobody really supports a privatised army, or police force.
TvD9BIGRaa	They damn well better start being afraid of us!|`|2KC467tFaa	I think the people fear the government. We have no rights anymore. They can search and arrest you for no reason and protect themselves under the Patriot Act. There is no privacy. We are watched wherever we go. They have the ability to see what books we're checking out of the library, what websites we visit, what we do, and who we are. It's terrifying. The government has the power; why would they fear the people who are at a "check mate" with being limited to choices of debt (college), low-paying jobs, or working for the government (giving in)? A few are on the upper end of the income bracket. However, the bigger the business, the more power they gain. If the government sees a powerful business, you can be sure they will soon work out a deal with tax cuts, befriending, and soon gaining another huge supporter of the government. Hopefully, that will change. The only true power we have lies in hopes and prayers. Sorry for the pessimistic point of view. Like I said, there is hope. Things may actually change, and we may once again have the power of the people.|`|K8WKKMLQaa	From my personal life experiences and watching the political progression that has lead to the power of the two main parties AND the slow integration of the media into political parties [and obama adverts on the internet & TV....adverts for a president]....something is wrong...something has been since 1990's and when somebody's life can be destroyed at the expense of a Rep. of the laws promotion i would say that the people are living in a state of fear.

Enter into the joy of your lord.’ 22 He also who had received two talents came and said, ‘Lord, you delivered to me two talents; look, I have gained two more talents besides them.’ 23 His lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.’ <br>  24 “Then he who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Lord, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered seed. 25 And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the ground. Look, there you have what is yours.’ <br>  26 “But his lord answered and said to him, ‘You wicked and lazy servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered seed. 27 So you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest. 28 So take the talent from him, and give it to him who has ten talents. <br>  29 ‘For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. 30 And cast the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’<br>  <br>  <br>  Some people see this as an approval for Capitalism.|`|6yGY8QPsaa	There was no such thing as Capitalism and Communism as we understand it in the Levant at the time of Jesus.  Capitalism was founded by Adam Smith in 1776, and Communism was founded by Karl Marx in 1848.  Any attempt to associate a modern understanding of economics and try to apply them to a time period in which it predates is anachronistic and does not take into account the setting of that time period.  Therefore, your question is innately erroneous and cannot have a rational answer to it.<br>  <br>  However, we can make an analysis of what modern economic system CLOSELY RESEMBLES what Jesus preached.  And one can undoubtedly argue that the teachings of the New Testament are very anti-Capitalist and very pro-Communist.  Take for example this passage:<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  "People who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction.  For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.  Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs (I Timothy 6: 9-10; NIV).<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  The Book of Acts describes that the Apostles did not have any material possessions, but instead shared their possessions equally amongst themselves.  <br>  <br>  "All the believers were together and had everything in common.  Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he needed" (Acts 2: 44-45; NIV).<br>  <br>  This passage, especially the last part, follows the Marxist doctrine of "To each according to his needs."  Furthermore, we can see that the Apostles were not interested in wealth or the accumulation of material possessions for themselves; but instead they shared their possessions in a communal fashion.  This is very similar to how a Communist government allocates the wealth and resources of the state equally amongst its citizens.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Jesus was also undoubtedly against materialism and the accumulation of private property (which is what capitalism is all about).  Take into consideration the following passage:<br>  <br>  "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on Earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.  But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.  For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also" (Matthew 6: 19-21; NIV).  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  "No one can serve two masters.  Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.  You cannot serve both God and Money" (Matthew 6: 24; NIV).<br>  <br>  Again, Jesus explains in this verse that the desire of wealth is an exact contradiction to the desire to live with God.  The two are incompatible.  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  The book of Luke shows Jesus' contempt for the rich and wealthy when he promulgates the Sermon on the Mount.<br>  <br>  "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of heaven."<br>  <br>  "Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisifed."<br>  <br>  "Woe unto you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort."<br>  <br>  "Woe unto you who are well fed now, for you will  go hungry."<br>  <br>  (The Sermon on the Mount: Luke 6; NIV).<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  But the most obvious example that exemplifies Communist ideology is when Jesus encounters the rich man, and asks him to sell his possessions and give it all to the poor:<br>  <br>  "If you [the rich man] want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.  Then come, follow me."<br>  <br>  When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.<br>  <br>  Then Jesus said to his disciples "I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.  Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God" (Matthew 19: 21-23; NIV).<br>  <br>  We can see from this passage that Jesus advocates the redistribution of wealth from rich to poor, which is very similar to Communism.  There are also numerous examples in which Jesus shows concern for the poor.|`|3YRrGfkiaa	Capitalism wasn't invented yet when the Bible was written.  Any attempt to find "quotes about Capitalism" in the Bible is thus an attempt at revisionism.|`|V6aH1vpQaa	it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God|`|jAgH5ewfaa	2Thess.3:10<br>  American King James Version<br>  "For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat."

It's evolution.<br>  <br>  The white race was a subspecies adapted to cold weather. They are Nanderthal x modern human hybrids, sturdy and made to live in a colder planet, with different trees around, with a different atmospheric composition.<br>  <br>  But, as the ice age ends (it's ending now), temperature fluctuations in the Northern hemisphere are greater and plants from warmer climates spread North. Pollen content in the air changes and approaches the composition of that in more tropical regions. UV rays fall more strongly to earth.<br>  <br>  The world is changing into a place not made for Neanderthal x human hybrids. The incidence of all types of cancer among them, and more so skin cancer, is just a sign of that. Decreasing sperm counts for the hybrids, weakening of their bones, etc. It's just a matter of time.<br>  <br>  As the environment changes, species adapted to a different environment move or die off. Since this change is global, the only path left for the hybrids is extinction.|`|MGOFjVnVaa	where did you get that crazy idea?<br>  <br>  fact is that the so-called "white" people have a lot less children<br>  than most of the others. this again is based on the fact that<br>  people with good education do not breed like mad.<br>  <br>  maybe compare the numbers of children in "white" American<br>  families to other population groups.<br>  <br>  oh yes - before i forget , we would be a lot better off without<br>  "America".Maybe you should realize that The USA is just<br>  a part of the continent America.|`|vZy28Yqjaa	You are kidding right?

AA11097492	Hmm, perhaps that's the reason you were a short term postie. Not connected to reality, that's the problem with what you understood. <br>  <br>  I used to work in a Royal dockyard; didn't think at any point it belonged directly to the Queen, although she was the top boss. <br>  <br>  I'm completely buggered if I can work out how anyone could come to the conclusion that mail, posted by a private citizen or company, could possibly belong to the Queen.<br>  <br>  But hey, it's on the level with your other political stuff. Not well researched and utter fantasy.<br>  <br>  Apollo. Should we assume from your nonsense answer that you don't know what the phrase 'constitutional monarchy' means? Allow me. No real power. No real authority. Royal Assent of laws is a rubber stamp process and nothing more because the Queen has no legal veto on anything. Ultimately she has no more power than you or I, since as a private citizen all she is actually able to do is vote.|`|1Mc6BOvKaa	Royal Mail is a "Crown company". This means it operates under the authority of the Crown, in the same way as the Government does.<br>  By making the mail "property of the Queen", it gives it that extra layer of legal protection that means people who cause any damage or theft of mail get the book thrown at them if they're caught. <br>  And trust me, I know of at least one short term member of staff from my office who is now looking at a stretch behind bars because they were caught very quickly after having a nose in an envelope.<br>  As such, even if it is privatised, it'll still be a crown company, so nothing will change in this respect.<br>  <br>  <br>  "Emasculated Britain" - You ask whats wrong with the proposal? You say it yourself. Six day universal delivery is protected by law. No company will be able to make a profit under this legal requirement, unless it has the monopoly. <br>  This is why Royal Mail makes a loss, and DHL doesn't. When Royal Mail had a monopoly, it made a profit on parcels and business mail, which paid for the loss making letter delivery. But as soon as companies like DHL were allowed into the market (and they don't have the same legal requirement), they could afford to undercut Royal Mail on the profit making parcels, because they didn't have the legally required loss making section of their own company.<br>  So this is why Royal Mail, even privatised, can't make a profit whilst the Universal Service Order is still in place. This means the Government will be paying to prop it up anyway. And we'll have a repeat of the Government propping up the banks controversy.<br>  Although my job is necessary for the Universal Service Order to be carried out, I'd still rather see Royal Mail run as either a loss making Government entity, or a profit making Government entity with a monopoly, as opposed to a private company paying fatcats whilst the Government still has to prop it up.<br>  <br>  Also - TNT wants to invest in the profit making sections - Parcel Force, and the business services that Royal Mail provides. It expects the Government to foot the bill for the loss making services.<br>  <br>  <br>  Erich M - You're wrong about that. TNT and Parcel Force are completely separate. Parcel Force is the Parcels side of the Royal Mail operation - its owned by the Royal Mail Group. <br>  What your describing is downstream access. This is where private companies collect mail from large customers, and sort it, but drop it off at Delivery Offices for Royal Mail to take it the final mile. A stupid concept designed to make for more competition, when all its done is allowed private companies to take a chunk of Royal Mail (and therefore the taxpayer's) profits.|`|441GSyaMaa	If it does get privatised would it just be Mail, or British mail? Oh it's so confusing lol<br>  <br>  And she's on all the stamps, would that still work?<br>  <br>  I don't think they should privatise it, how would that help the business?

For most, nothing at all will change.<br>  <br>  Presumably those with the thumbs down are those who are okay with the idea of half a billion pounds of our money leaking away every year?<br>  <br>  APOLLO - the European Parliament is 100% elected, didn't you know.

We need to bring back ALL our industry and services back under democratic public ownership. Why should the greedy rich control all our industry?

Get it?<br>  <br>  When you run on "Change we can believe in" and then rip into the US Treasury for pork, earmarks and do the exact worst that can be done, spending-wise as there's STILL no pressure on banks to give loans, lower salaries (remember that $500k BS about exec-salaries?), 60-more billions to AIG, nothing resolved at GM etc, money bleeding when there needs to be 1,000s of WHITE COLLAR execs being fired for outright incompetence? and still, Obama is EXPANDING the gov't with high-paid jobs, travel expenses, there's no AUSTERITY and cutting-back.. just throwing good money, after back.. so.. where IS THE CHANGE for the better?<br>  <br>  You want to swallow more excuses? as your Chief of STAFF in Rahm Emanuel is on national talk shows TALKING ABOUT RUSH FREAKING LIMBAUGH to misdirect the media/public about a radio-guy instead a trillions in spending, a quickie-passed Stimulus Bill done without ANYONE being able to read it?!??! That was the largest crime ever commtted by our elected officials -- right in front of our faces, and you can't see that??? you're talking about BUSH?<br>  <br>  _____<br>  <br>  Let's be honest...there's 100s of examples to refute your statement.  Criticism & reaction comes with the Office. In fact, there's a Obama Shield around the new president.. who wasn't criticized for not immediately addressing Israel/Gaza (sending Mitchell, instead of Hillary last month)... and has been given a PASS about declaring the Clinton Administration's NAFTA Bill a problem-area for global/American business ...worker/manufacturing, etc. and now? Obama and the media seems to forget that main issue, right? (that my friend -- a media Blind Eye which is very dangerous..).<br>  <br>  Bush was a Chimp and a Shrub, called many many names & mocked every day of his presidency (which hasn't happened at ALL across late-night TV, etc. about Obama).. his background was questioned (to the MAX) for example his serving in the National Guard in Georgia, I know you may been too young to know that a Big 3 News Anchor actually aired FALSIFIED information to discredit the new President & far from his policies/choices about him as a liar.. can you IMAGINE if say, a Brian Williams was drilling Obama on being born in Kenya, as his mother & aunts says they witnessed?<br>  <br>  Come on, now.|`|h9SHkkWlaa	LOL....People were 100000000000 X Times tougher on Bush. Although Bush is no longer President; many uninformed people are still blaming Bush for the mistakes that Obama is NOW making. <br>  Obama has done more to harm America in less than 2 months in Office than Bush did in 8 years in Office.<br>  Nobody is pushing for Obama to fail. Obama is doing a great job of failing on his own.|`|f4RnGIeSaa	The most simple answer to this question is that people screamed that he would be the hero of the American people and save us all.  He constantly implied that only he could save us, and his first action as president to fix the problem is a horrible spending bill that has little to nothing in it that will stimulate the economy.<br>  <br>  His first step was a huge error, and unless he comes up with an actually intelligent move next, he may never live it down.|`|dD41xKb0aa	because white conservatives of america are still racist and only care for there rich friends and could careless about people who are not like them.these people are as.s. holes they talk all this crap but let me go see they dumb a.s.sees try and run a country how do they know that he is spending us into debt are they economist no no one want know how nothing turns out until they actually see it happening.....SO ALL OF THEM NEED to shut up and kiss a backside.....and to all them people calling him a moron have you been to harvard...i don't think so so shut the hell up|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	The trend seems to be really to bash presidents these days no matter what they do.

However for those who don't..<br>  A 12 foot deep trench should be dug along the border. Then fill in trench w/ cement and errect a 20 foo high metal wall for a border. Every 50 yards or so, a power source is to be connected to the wall thus stopping any from touching or climbing wall in attempt to enter U.S. illegally. If and when any become smart enough to try and use wooden ladders to get over top of the wall, there will be guards stationed every 100 yds who will, without hesitation, shoot the person attempting illegal entry BEFORE they get over the wall thus causing them to fall back on the other side of the wall. Their bodies will serve as a visible deterrent to those coming after them that it may not be a good idea for them to try to enter the US illegally.|`|c007743b9141326a3e5300dda8bf9c4caa	I think it is very unfortunate that many feel they have no other choice but to come to this country to provide for their families and survive. But at the same time, I have to weigh that against the fact that they are, in fact, flooding the job market with millions of low skilled workers thus suppressing wages (to a point where Americans who DID flock to those jobs start to leave the profession and it suddenly becomes a job that "Americans won't do"), taking jobs from Americans, and using up social services. As bad as I feel for these folks I have to weigh that against the hardship they are placing on the American people. <br>  <br>  I have no problem with people coming here legally but the flood has to be stopped especially in this economy where I can't even find an opening in retail much less telecommunications which is what I went to school for.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	If they come here to work hard and improve their lives for them and their family, I have nothing but respect for them.  I've met some of these types and they are admirable people, but I would prefer they get citizenship.  It would not only benefit the country in keeping track of them, but benefit them as well: no fear of deportation, and they would be eligible for social programs legally that they might need.|`|zb2EwgKVaa	Not a fan and we should punish the hell out of the businesses that give them jobs.

Not bothering to learn the language is a further insult to people who have.<br>  <br>  And they put themselves at risk, too. Because they're here illegally it's a gamble for them to call the police, fire department, etc. They can't get insurance, and unless they've got some forged documentation I don't *think* they can get food stamps or govt. aid (could be wrong). Without being a citizen they shouldn't have access to those things anyway, but it opens them up to injury, abuse, and starvation.<br>  <br>  They come over here and wind up powerless. I haven't experienced the lives they leave, but I have a hard time believing what they get here is an improvement. It'd be better for both US citizens and the illegal immigrants if they just did it legally.|`|ipqxNSvCaa	Fat pie said:"They would've chosen american for a reason.

If jobs and money don't matter, then why do illegal aliens come here for them?  Most illegal aliens from Mexico (the one country sending the most legal and illegal aliens to the U.S.), for example, HAD JOBS BACK IN MEXICO according to a study by the Pew Hispanic Center, so were hardly the "poorest of the poor".  They came here because they wanted "more".  Ditto, illegal aliens from other parts of Latin America, such as Brazil, some of whom decided to go home when the exchange rate with their home currency became very favorable, and jobs here harder to find.   For that matter, Mexico is a wealthy country so why shouldn't it support its own citizens?|`|Ut2ouMRKaa	they are in a country that is at war right now because of being attacked form the inside by people jest like them.

HlD9dRF2aa	When 'Communism' was popular until it was identified with a communist DICTATORSHIP, it changed it's name to 'Socialism'.  <br>  <br>  When people realized the name was simply changed to sound more acceptable but was just soft communism, it evolved into the word 'Progressive' to denote the party's ability to move our country forward (Such as 3 of 'The Great Leaps Forward' of China which were abject failures). <br>  <br>  When people realized that this party had nothing really to do with 'progress' and was more interested in redistribution of wealth, the party changed its name to the 'liberal' party giving the impression that they were all about freedom and giving things away in large quantities for nothing (or rather at the expense of the producers of this country). <br>  <br>  I'm not saying that people are communists, or progressives, or socialists just because they consider themselves 'liberals'.  I have friends that call themselves liberal -- but they're for lower taxes, strong defense, believe in God, hate governement pork spending, send their kids to private school and truly believe that small government is better.

AA10118655	First, child support from your father is not for you to spend, but it is for your mother to use to help raise you.

Your mother can try calling. They may not be giving you the information because you are not the person entitled to receive the child support payments.

They endeavored to advance the kingdom of God.  Now, if you want to argue that the kingdom of God is best advanced through democracy and freedom then we can talk, but I just want it clear that they had faith in GOD, not democracy or capitalism.  :-)<br>  <br>  Numbers 1 and 2 are in reverse order!  Let's say that there was a country somewhere in the world who loved and honored its citizens in every way, but they were not Christian or democratic.  Are we clear that they aren't committing an atrocities against their people or their neighbors?  They just aren't a democracy!  It is NOT America's job to try to get democracy into that country.  Yes, maybe we think that democracy is a superior form of government (by the way, we're a Republic), but I see America's FIRST job around the world as putting down tyranny and evil.  So, in the absence of that evil oppression, we do nothing!  But IF we overthrow a government because it is tyrranical then what?  We'll probably try to implement a democratic form of government.  It's what we do!<br>  <br>  3. Too soon to tell!  I pray so, but clearly there are those in Iraq that have a vested interest in the failure of democracy.  But I believe it was a fairly noble cause and a fascinating attempt.<br>  <br>  4. America is the ONLY country in the history of the world that goes to war and in victory does NOT take the spoils of the losing country!  I am so sickened by the liars--and I mean LIARS!--who claim that we go to war for oil, for instance.  YES, America has interests around the world.  But we in effect liberated Kuwait.  Under all the rules of historical presidence, Kuwaity oil was now our oil.  We put out the fires and left there.  We sort of ask them to pay us the costs of liberating them, but they never did!  It was OUR OIL FOR THE TAKING and we walked away.  We BUY Iraqi oil at world market prices!  Iraq gets the PROFIT from the sale of ITS oil to the U.S. and other countries.  If you know your history of all the early empires (e.g., Roman or German) then you know they fought to claim territory and possessions.  The U.S. rebuilt Japan!  The U.S. is rebuilding Iraq!  The U.S. left Kuwait!  And on and on and on.  You're a fool, if you believe otherwise.<br>  <br>  5. Not necessarily.  It's the best form of government that's ever been tried.  America is called "a great experiment."  It succeeded once and is now failing.  America is NOT the country it once was.  My belief is that America rose to power so quickly NOT because we were a democracy, per se, but because we were a people of faith.  We were driven by a genuine love for God.  THAT was our motivation to do the things we did!  We fought for God, we suffered for God, etc.<br>  <br>  6. Americans today are the least free of any Americans in history.  Our freedoms erode more everyday!  Are we free?  Well, compared to what!  Virtually everything is taxed to death or regulated.  Laws rule our lifes.  We've become slaves to government.  Even our religious liberties have eroded.  We're sorta free today, but it should scare the living hell out of everyone of us how much freer Americans were just 2 or 3 generations back.<br>  <br>  7. Now?  It's all but over.  It divided America, which is sad.  I frankly hate the Americans who are soooooooooo blinded by their hatred for this country that they see evil intent in everything America does.  Yes, I questioned Bush on why Iraq and why then!  But once he made the decision, I said ... "Let's win!"  Some wackos on the left didn't want us to win!  I'm sick to my stomach to remember how they said it would be "very bad for THEIR party if the U.S. military starts to win the war in Iraq."  Sad!  Obama is one of these America is bad countries.  I've heard other blacks say "the Constitution is the white man's document."  LOL!  The Constitution freed them!  But okay.  <br>  <br>  8. No!  As I said earlier, our freedoms are eroding and we are in decline, but I am NOT packing my bags to move.

For the anticommunist, the Bill of Rights and other constitutional protections of freedom of speech and association are applicable only to those who accept the premises of the present political and social order. These antidemocratic conceptions inevitably give rise to authoritarian and fascistic tendencies. McCarthyism was not the unfortunate manifestation of an “excessive” anticommunism—rather, it was the logical expression of anticommunism’s reactionary essence.<br>  <br>  The ruling class promoted anticommunism as a de facto state ideology, not out of any principled opposition to the crimes of Stalinism, but rather because it was the necessary ideological prop for the United States’ most critical geo-strategic goals. Following the Second World War, the US was the world’s dominant imperialist power, with the USSR the sole challenger to its global hegemony.<br>  While the Stalinist bureaucracy in the Soviet Union had betrayed the cause of international socialism, the USSR’s nationalized property relations and state monopoly over foreign trade blocked the untrammeled penetration of international capital into the resource-rich country. In addition, the Stalinist state’s ideological and material support for national liberation movements in Asia and Africa was viewed as a serious threat to the stability of the international capitalist system. The communist bogeyman was erected to condition the American people to accept the initiation of far-reaching international engagements against the USSR—most notably in Korea and, later, Vietnam.<br>  Anticommunism also served a vitally important domestic function. The ideology facilitated the suppression of any independent working class movement. The two years following the end of the Second World War saw an unprecedented strike wave throughout the country, as workers fought to prevent a return to the social conditions of the 1930s. Anticommunism was the banner under which a purge of militants and socialists from the trade unions was carried out. It was, moreover, the ideological and political cement for the AFL-CIO’s postwar alliance with US imperialism.<br>  Anticommunism was further utilized by the right wing to advance its long-standing objective of obliterating all remnants of the New Deal reform measures. The reactionary forces behind McCarthyism sought to associate any social reform measure that compromised the ruling elite’s accumulation of wealth with communism.<br>  <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/dec2004/mcca-d18.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/dec200...</a><br>  Capitalism exists today because of the betrayals of the working class by its own organizations - the mass political parties and the trade unions. “The world political situation as a whole is chiefly characterized by a historical crisis of the leadership of the proletariat.” These words, with which Leon Trotsky began the founding document of the Fourth International, remain supremely relevant as a definition of contemporary political reality. There is not a single mass organization in the world today that presents itself as an opponent of the existing world capitalist order, let alone summons the working class to revolutionary struggle. This has created a surreal environment, in which the anger and discontent of the working class is suppressed by the old, politically sclerotic organizations. But as Trotsky also wrote in the founding document of the Fourth International, The Transitional Program: “The orientation of the masses is determined first by the objective conditions of decaying capitalism and second by the treacherous politics of the old workers’ organizations. Of these factors, the first of course is the decisive one: the laws of history are stronger than the bureaucratic apparatus.”<br>  <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/sep2008/prin-s25.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/sep200...</a>|`|2FeDnO0Saa	Because of a misunderstanding of what communism / socialism is. Socialism seems to be commonly equated with Stalinism, which as you point out could not be further from what Marx and Engels put forward. They imagined a democratically run, socialist society - from the bottom up, with wealth shared equally amongst all. They also, as you say, pointed out the failures of capitalism and the reasons why we need to replace it.<br>  <br>  To those who say "it didn't work" - Stalinism didn't work. Democratic socialism was sadly snuffed out by Stalin in Russia from 1923 and was attacked by 20 countries after the victory of the revolution. (source 1)<br>  <br>  In Britain, True socialism provided homes and jobs in Liverpool in the 1980s, winning massive concessions from the Tory government through popular support for socialist policies (source 2), before it was snuffed out by the betrayal of Neil Kinnock.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  <br>  Lenin described socialism as "the dictatorship of the proletariat", by which he meant that capitalism is the dictatorship of the rich and that we need to stop the capitalists regaining power. However, this is a democratic dictatorship, as the workers represent the vast majority of the human race - they are the ones who should be in charge. Democracy means "rule of the people" - if that does not describe socialism, then I do not know what does. It is capitalism which is not democratic - we have an empty choice between mainstream parties who are all centre-right. The media does not allow small protest groups, the everyday man in the street a representative voice. We have no parties any more which represent ordinary people.<br>  <br>  Join the campaign for a new workers' party - <a href="http://www.cnwp.org.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnwp.org.uk</a>|`|OC8NWQkyaa	It is materialsm.  It places the person and his right to decide for himself what he needs in order to live a good life over the very goods that are there to serve him.  I don't think it's accurate to say that the dictators were not following "Marx and Engels".  Pure capitalism also has problems of materialism.  But the distribution of wealth is not best decided by the power of the State in totality and it is immoral to take away all peoples power to own property.  The principal of "subsidiarity" is highly important here.  You might research that to understand.|`|FOai1n0Xaa	I think the hatred is perceived larger than it actually is. <br>  The reason this happens is because in capitalism, the ruling class that controls the means of production also largely controls the ideological superstructure that educates us and informs our 'common sense', by that I mean the state, the media etc. Obviously its not in the interests of a ruling class to look favorably on a system that abolishes their privilege. <br>  <br>  Also, they want to assert that their dominance is inevitable and inescapable. Simply saying that communism (Marx's egalitarian democracy, not the brutal state capitalist dictatorships of USSR, China, Vietnam, etc) is against human nature is totally narrow minded and ignorant of human history. For most of its history humanity has existed in egalitarian societies (hunter gatherers etc which didn't reward everyone on their merit), there is nothing intrinsic about human competitiveness. We are greedy and self serving because we live in a system that rewards it (capitalism) not the other way round. The way 'human nature' manifests itself changes depending on the way we are socialized. If we lived in a socialist society there would be no material benefit to being greedy or competitive, such actions would most likely be met with ostracism. Compare that to capitalism where greed is rewarded with an increase in wealth and power.<br>  <br>  But the way its presented in school, the media, by politicians, etc. is that humanity's competitive flaw and drive for dominance is essential, timeless and inevitable. All contemplation over this fact is limited to the narrow confines of capitalist society. Thus it becomes 'common sense' that this is the invariable reality; that capitalism is the 'natural order', that women are inferior to men, that your boss is more deserving than you are, etc. Of course socialists must reject these fallacies. But it is a lot harder to do when our numbers remain so infinitesimal.|`|cdfaf090d61b4780b0e9991dfb477d46aa	Ive read it as well as a Marx biography.  fanciful ideas but...<br>  As long as some people seek to gain advantage over other people communism will never work.

Any system that does so invariably impedes progress and requires a strong government to decide what the "equitable distribution" would be, since the individuals who create more than they take could simply decide they don't want to share if there isn't some government oversight, which inevitably leads to dictatorship.

What happened to ALL OF OUR "rights" to medical privacy?  <br>  <br>  The answer to your question is NO!

But they had to allow it to get the working classes (farmers, shopkeepers, etc.. a.k.a. anti-federalists) to sign it.|`|bqdRffPLaa	yes the constitution stills mean something. For example, the government has to do things based on the constitution.|`|vKAILWpwaa	When I was 15-years-old, I swore my first oath to support and defend the United States Constitution when I served as a young page boy in the House of Representatives.<br>  <br>  Later, as a Member of Congress (and as a Republican and a conservative), I took that same oath to the Constitution, which every congressman and senator currently serving has also supposedly sworn their allegiance.<br>  <br>  So knowing that, how can we explain the U.S. Congress passing a new law that virtually repeals the guarantees against unreasonable search and seizure in the Fourth Amendment of the Bill of Rights?<br>  <br>  My answer: cowardly fear. It's not fear of the "terrorism boogeyman" - but fear of not getting reelected! Politics rules, to Hell with principle!<br>  <br>  The minority Republicans in Congress, sheep that they are, went along with Bush's demand for even greater police power over all of us. But the real hypocrites were the Democrats that now control both Houses.<br>  <br>  I am always nervous when I find myself in agreement with the New York Times , but they said it right:<br>  <br>  "It was appalling to watch over the last few days as Congress - now led by Democrats - caved in to yet another unnecessary and dangerous expansion of President Bush's powers, this time to spy on Americans in violation of basic constitutional rights. Many of the 16 Democrats in the Senate and 41 in the House who voted for the bill said that they had acted in the name of national security, but the only security at play was their job security."<br>  <br>  The Same Congressmen Who Attacked the USA PATRIOT Act NOW Support Wiretapping?<br>  <br>  These are the same Democrats that have been loudly  attacking (as they should be attacking), the befuddled U.S. Attorney General Gonzales for violating civil rights using the PATRIOT Act. And they also attacked President Bush for his secret wiretapping when it was revealed late last year.<br>  <br>  As The Times noted the law "...would allow the government to intercept, without a warrant, every communication into or out of any country, including the United States. Instead of explaining all this to American voters - the minimal benefits and the enormous risks - the Democrats have allowed Mr. Bush and his fear mongering to dominate all discussions on terrorism and national security."<br>  <br>  According to neutral observers, the new law gives the U.S. government virtually unchecked  power to secretly wiretap all our phone calls and spy on and read our emails, faxes or other electronic communications without any court order and no due process of law.<br>  <br>  This is a radical, subversive departure from American legal traditions, as pointed out by my colleague, Mark Nestmann. As an attorney, I say this new wiretap surveillance law is yet another abandonment of the rule of law and a violation of due process in America.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Gone is the requirement that laws must relate to legitimate government interests and may not result in unfair or arbitrary treatment of an individual. Now impartial judges are replaced by faceless bureaucrats and anti-terror police who will decide our fate.<br>  <br>  What Happens When Fear Rules Congress<br>  <br>  In 1757, Edmund Burke wrote: "No passion so effectively robs the mind of all its powers of acting and reasoning as fear."<br>  <br>  Fear as a decisive factor in political and national life is nothing new in history. But President Bush has made fear his trademark. He constantly uses the fear factor to get his way, describing threats that are amorphous, shadowy, unclear, yet perceived as very real, the threat of terrorism.<br>  <br>  Politicians too often have employed fear as a controlling and guiding principle to achieve their dubious ends. Such politicians offer themselves as protectors. National leaders have touted their remedies against alleged foreign invasions, barbaric tribes, hated minorities, Communists, drugs and a host of other manufactured threats.<br>  <br>  Now the fear of the hour is terrorism. Yes, the threat is real and it must be guarded against, but not by surrendering all our freedoms.<br>  <br>  Last year, President Bush was able to rush the dubious Military Commission Act through the Congress. Now he has been able ram through this latest radical surveillance measure. This is the raw politics of anti-terrorism in all its tawdry operation.<br>  <br>  If a member of Congress does not support whatever the proposal may be, he or she is accused of being "soft" on terrorism. Nearly six years after 9/11, and with the miserable track record of Attorney General Gonzales, a majority in Congress rolls over and proclaims: "I am against the terrorists, too!" - as they vote to trash the Bill of Rights.<br>  <br>  Why Spy on Just the Terrorists?<br>  <br>  And don't think for a moment that Big Brother's police will limit this unchecked surveillance law to anti-terrorism alone.<br>  <br>  Just as they have done with the PATRIOT Act, this vast power will be used to spy on anyone they wish, whether alleged IRS tax evaders or SEC violators.<br>  <br>  No one is safe from trumped up charges based on eavesdropping on our phone calls|`|8cLV2OPYaa	Our rights are already dissolving right before our eyes.

39KUKALFaa	The reality of Bush is that the economy tanked because he entered a room where the Dems had spilt gasoline all over the floor and on barrels of oil by forcing bankers to lend to uncreditworthy borrowers.<br>  <br>  A clever and sincere man would have turned off the light and locked the door, while working out how to douse the place in water or something better.<br>  <br>  George decided that he did not care, even though he knew about it, because he proposed legislation that the Democrats blocked. It would have gone a long way to solve the problem.<br>  <br>  But bad character will out. He and Cheney were so greedy for Texas and Wyoming that they decided to put the oil price through the roof.<br>  <br>  First, they manipulated the strategic petroleum reserve. Congress had to close that down. They were using it as a price support for Arabian oil.<br>  <br>  Second, they refused to police the Iraqi oil fields, so they never recovered production.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, they kept in place Bush I's ban on the drilling offshore. This was an executive order in addition to the legislative ban.<br>  <br>  Fourthly, they decided that when McCain/Palin was about to win, that they would kill Lehman Brothers to throw Obama the election, because he is against offshore oil drilling. Bush went on television 3 times before the election to tank the economy. He could have waited until after the election and he could have bailed Lehman out. He bailed everyone else out. Lehman had money market funds like bank accounts and this is what killed intermediation by non-banks.<br>  <br>  The sum of all these is that Bush is not only a crook, but the higher oil prices amounted to the straw that broke the camel's back - in this case, people's budgets. People could not afford their mortgages. In prolonging the Iraq War, he is probably capable of being prosecuted for war crimes. I think that he should be as an example of what happens when you put country last.<br>  <br>  But I agree that he did not create the situation, but he tried to take advantage of it and tanked the economy, the GOP, the country and McCain/Palin.

tsjLHXzUaa	What is an "illegal download"?  I dont think such things exist.<br>  <br>  Places like Limewire are perfectly legal.  If they werent, do you think theyd be permitted to continue operation?<br>  <br>  The "illegal" aspect of it is the violation of copyright laws... piracy.  But as long as the original author gets credit and no profit is made on the selling or distribution of downloaded material, then no such laws are broken.<br>  <br>  Even if illegal downloads are done via Limewire, the individuals are the criminals.  The site and software are not to blame, just as its not a guns fault for shooting someone.  This is yet another reason why such sites are allowed to continue.  Limewire is a site that created and hosts a person-to-person file sharing program.  They dont host the downloaded material itself, and cannot be found guilty of what their software is used for, just as a gun manufacturer cannot be found guilty of shooting someone.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, literal interpretation of law gets a little hazy when dealing with the internet.  Certain materials are illegal to sell in the US, but not illegal to buy in the US.  If done over the internet, its perfectly possible to buy a product that is illegal to sell in this country, from a country in which its illegal to buy but not sell... and no laws are broken.<br>  <br>  So even if certain sites were illegal to host in the US, they may still be accessible via the internet from within the US.  And certain online activities would need to be interpreted under local law. (no one sold locally, but you did buy locally, etc.)<br>  <br>  ========<br>  <br>  Are you two years old?
