aa1f8cd32d0e1daf2f5edabf7ffd512daa	My 2 cents on motivation:<br>  <br>  Look in the mirror. What you see is what you get in 8 months, UNLESS you do something positive to change. If you do commit to weightloss, you'll see incremental improvements as you progress & each little bit of progress can fuel your motivation.<br>  <br>  Think Florida. Picture yourself on the beach, healthy & in shape.<br>  <br>  Conversely, think Florida, picture yourself on the beach, with a gut, struggling to get up to fetch another beer.<br>  <br>  Picture yourself in 20 years if you don't fix the weight, think of the sharp pains in the knees as they start to complain & wear out from the extra pounding (how would you feel being hit over the head with an 84 lb weight at each step? )<br>  <br>  Check out, join, & participate daily in the Diet Power Monthly Challenge, ... great bunch of motivated, supportive, folks there ...|`|a8aa73a24c7f84ed6ec579a0d5d49e4eaa	You're not gonna like this, but the only sure way of dieting and succesfully losing weight (and keeping it off) is to burn more calories than you take in.  <br>  <br>  There are easy/fast fixes that will let you lose weight temporarily, but to lose weight and keep it off it takes months/years.|`|46415f8942ff56ca9c4f39463df4d905aa	Eating healthy, in small amounts, several times a day.<br>  Avoid too many delicious carbs, but don't cut them out completely.<br>  If you are not really hungry, don't eat.<br>  Keep active, drink lots of water.|`|6daa11f876adec8a30ffd86f0822cc29aa	If you don't have will-power, no diet will work. Don't completely restrict everything, cheat just a little a day and keep doing that until you don't have to cheat anymore. If you dont cheat a tiny bit a day, and eliminate Everything you like to eat or drink, 1 day in the early stages of diet you will have a big bad cheat day, and not stick to your diet. Also, exercise (even if its not everday) at least a couple of times a week. Cardio is great while dieting.|`|d228be98bdd441ac03141cadaaca3ff0aa	put down the fork and go for a walk drink water.
4c069195c61fa51ccb823c64dd1effacaa	if you're going casual I would go with some dark colored jeans with a dressier shirt.  A black top dressed up with some pretty jewelry with your hair barely curled OR if you're thinking of something more formal for Christmas I would wear something black on the bottom half such as black slacks or a long black skirt with a gold top (shimmer or plain).  with some fancy jewelry of course.  Hope this helps!|`|eae0a100b9a167f42cfdead155f7c5f5aa	Red Sweaters are really cute, but totally cliched. If you look good in dark green, try getting a dark green, fuzzy sweater in some stylish fit, maybe off the shoulder.<br>  <br>  For bottoms it depends on the occasion. If you're just sitting at home with the family, go for nice jeans or black slacks. If you're going out, maybe a black below-knee length skirt and ballet flats or tall leather boots.|`|ed3f82150457440a3f2f7f6f16b0c4c4aa	depends on you plans.  im wearing black pants, and a nice sweater to go to dinner at my brothers house.|`|ff1da17913bbe4a4871ec0c1a0727c7aaa	If you have a Christmas vest or jacket wear it.

Discovering out of the way natural hot springs.  Many girls love this as well!<br>  <br>  It's a bit of a drive for you- but one really cool place is a hot springs in the Saline Valley.  The Saline Valley is on valley west of Death Valley.  It's free- but you'll need to bring all your camping gear with you.  Natural hot springs.  It's very cool!<br>  <br>  You'll need to look it up, or buy a book on California Hot Springs.<br>  <br>  UPDATE:<br>  I was just looking for you and found this post from a year and a half ago that indicated that the water had declined.

9f401380993e280c348855babee66e8baa	Yes, the Fusion Hair Strand Method for Extensions (usually called Fusion Hair Extensions) last over a month. It all depends on how you take care of the hair and how often you go to your hair stylist for maintenance though. I have had Fusion Extensions in my hair since October. I see my hair stylist every 3 weeks for maintenance. I wash my hair every 2 days and do not use alot of different hair products. With this routine, my hair stylist says the extensions can last up to 4-6 months. The cost for these extensions are not cheap, but in my opinion worth every penny. I love the way the extensions look. Most people can't even tell that I have them in and I constantly get compliments about how beautiful my hair looks. Good luck with whichever method you choose!|`|028908623891a267dc96205ad9202b6aaa	I'm...not sure..

ade6bcc27281315e59630cbc5b7bb014aa	I use a very soft bristled tooth brush and a mild white toothpaste (not gel).  Just put a small amount of toothpaste on the brush, wet it down, and gently brush the gold and diamonds, rinse well or the toothpaste will dry and make it look cloudy.  Dry with a soft towel (I use a cloth t-shirt or cloth baby diaper).<br>  Good luck!|`|791d4f9e4f79c13e41e826352dcb9b61aa	Use an  old soft toothbrush, with white toothpaste. after you brush away the dirt,rinse throughly. then dry. after the pieces dry,buff with a jewelery cloth.|`|216141096b1a257bc4d0dc41b925a001aa	Put the jewellery in a small bowl with a little bit of mild soap and lukewarm water.

Put the top on it then, when you are washing your clothes put it on top of the washer  or the dryer and  let the vibration of the machines gently shake the jar.  *LMAO*<br>  *serious look* The main key to this is when you take it out and rinse it,  use a blow dryer to dry it, if you use a cloth , tiny fibers get caught up in the jewelry if there is stones & facets.<br>  But use a soft cloth to polish the metal.<br>  Always use a blow dryer!|`|b9c2499f0da55e2c5c2ad05aafb17351aa	When I want a thorough cleaning I use a sonic jewelry cleaning machine.

8677da33c1b20e65234363dde43aff18aa	I've had my tongue pierced for almost 7 years.  It didn't actually hurt that bad getting it done-my belly button hurt a heck of a lot worse!-but afterwards it was another story.  It swelled up pretty bad and lukewarm soup was my friend for a few weeks...it took close to a month to get back to "normal".  You have to be almost religious with cleanliness during the healing process as well.  I would rinse with salt water after every drink and meal/snack.  I think the first time I took it out for any length of time was about two months or so after I got it done, for a dinner with my grandparents.  Even after only a few hours, it was a tight squeeze getting it back in.  Hope that helps!  Oh, and btw...my husband LOVES it...|`|4e5c6f9015d687ac5a160a18dfc42d29aa	I had my tongue pierced for 15 months. I took it out in May and it already closed up.

I recommend not doing that next time, I get greedy too I feel its not growing faster and it's just getting greasy.  If you really like using both shampoos.  Why not shampoo with one and wash and shampoo with the other.  Although avoid mixing shampoos or doing that too much.  It also depends on if you wash your hair everyday, other than that wearing shampoo daily is fairly healthy and should not do any harm.|`|3cc9a05e0664c8ec4282e2aef2758850aa	You can be experiencing hair breakaged or your hair can be damaged. If you have been lossing large amounts of hair over a period of time then most likely it's breakaged/damaged hair.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is not to mix any product together, because the outcome can be greater then what it seems. You should stick to each product and not mix.<br>  <br>  If it is breakaged then your best bet is to see a stylist and have them give the proper hair care treatment to prevent this.

5f0f9b83760938846ff76c4e58b88636aa	Depending on what you're doing, you can add slide transitions, just like on Power Point.  On the left side of the screen when you're in WMM, if you click the drop down menu for "Edit Movie", there is a list of video transitions.  You can click "view video transitions", and there they are!  Then you just have to place them in.  About the music- I had to do a school project using this program, and to do the music my group and I just recorded it from our iPods into a microphone.  (We had trouble importing it through iTunes- something about the files not being "compatible").  If you just record it, then save the audio clip, you can then put it in your movie.  Under the menu "Capture Video" (once again on the left side) hit "Import Audio or Music".  Then find where you saved your audio clip at, and then it's imported it.  Anything else you need to import can be found under the "Capture Video" drop down menu.  This program is tedious and frustrating, but the end results are really great, so don't give up!  If you have any other questions, just ask!! I'm happy to share my knowledge and help you!!<br>  <br>  <33

HjKipXPzaa	some people are so freaking rude.  Ignore the h8ters.  First of all, how fast are you stretching, you shouldnt be seeing blood.  Do a sea salt soak, this is how you make it:<br>  <br>  Dissolve a pinch (1/4 teaspoon) of sea salt into one cup (8 oz.) of warm or hot water in a clean cup. <br>  I love H2Ocean, its a spray that you can use, and it makes it so you dont have to continually make the stuff.  Use the salt solution instead of Antibiotic ointment. If you wanna use something besides the salt solution, try some emu oil|`|KUWDICSVaa	Do not use antibacterial ointment. It causes your skin to close. I do not know where your gages are, but it sounds like you should contact a professional.

jQGN2Bivaa	Depending on your age, you could just give it a little time and they may very well resolve themselves on their own.... but then again, you're online asking questions about how to correct the problem, so I assume you're probably tired of waiting. That's totally understandable. If you've already tried "pinching" the nipples between your fingers (almost like you're trying to "pop" the nipple out like you would a pimple)  and you've been doing this persistently for a couple of months or so --then I'd recommend getting your nipples pierced. I know that may freak you out, but its really not all that bad. I personally know of several doctors who refer their patients, with inverted nipples, to piercers for this exact reason. Its one of the cheapest remedies with very good results. Seriously, look into it. <br>  If piercing is out of the question, then I'd recommend you start calling cosmetic surgeons. Ask if they perform the procedure to correct inverted nipples. There are quite a few of them out there... and most of these can be done "in-office" (so not only are you in-and-out pretty quickly, but you also get to avoid paying additional hospital usage fees.) The procedure isn't as expensive as most would think... you can easily have it done for a couple of hundred bucks (per nipple) if you shop around a little... but please be sure to choose a creditable doctor. Also, you should know that you'll have at least one or two stitches in the center of each nipple for a few days... and they'll be quite sore. <br>  Those are your best options as far as I'm concerned. The others aren't as easily obtainable or they're just not proven to work as well. Good luck!|`|i2IVZDkxaa	A little cold water should do the trick!<br>  and of course you can easily entice your boyfriend to help!|`|sw4Adyycaa	UMMM YA WATS THE QUESTION|`|VPnovdzxaa	no girl just wait

(aquí yo he encontrado varias recetas naturistas para curar a mis hijos de algunas cosas y me han funcionado. es una buena página.<br>  <a href="http://boticabuela.com/paginas/pag_general.htm" rel="nofollow">http://boticabuela.com/paginas/pag_gener...</a>|`|3tZ6CDvOaa	Perspirex<br>  es lo mejorcito que por el momento conozco. <br>  <br>  Es un envase en roll-on peque?o, pero que dura bastante<br>  hay  que aplicárselo por la noche con la piel seca y que trate de depilarse despues de la aplicacion si no le va arder y cada 3 días aproximadamente que se  lo vuelva a aplicar <br>  <br>  Pero si la  deberías de llevar  al médico, porque puede ser un problema, hormonal o de las glandulas sudoríperas.|`|UQJ4ZnVdaa	No se permite spam aquí, pero voy a tratar de describirte un desodorante:<br>  1. Es para hombres. Que lo use, no importa, pero le puede evitar el sudor.<br>  2. Speed Stick lo uso diario en la ma?ana, después del ba?o. Si no le da resultado que pruebe el Obao. También puede probar algunos otros, para hombres, son más fuertes, hasta que encuentre el de su tipo, que le funcione realmente.<br>  3. También, si no le disminuye el sudor, que se ba?e dos o tres veces al día, no le lleva más de 10 minutos, o que se los lleve, no importa.<br>  La otra solución sería utilizar sudaderas interiores para que absorban el sudor y la mantengan seca. Lo importante que ande cómoda.<br>  La verdad que las personas con las cuales convive, ni le dicen nada, ni siquiera la critican, a veces ni la toman en cuenta; o sea, que se quite eso de la mente, que viva su vida y deje que los demás vivan la suya.<br>  Mira, una vez un americano tenía una plaga en su jardín, por más plaguicidas que utilizó, nunca la pudo exterminar. Consultó con un jardinero chino y le respondió:<br>  Si tu mal no tiene remedio, aprende a vivir con él.<br>  Mi abuelo decía: Si tu mal no tiene remedio, de qué te apuras y si lo tiene de qué te preocupas.<br>  La cuestión es de que ella viva feliz y contenta de la vida, que no le preocupe el "qué dirá" de la gente.<br>  Suerte. ánimo Dios los bendiga.|`|etigk09qaa	PODRIA SER EL REXONA YA SEA EN AEROSOL O ROLL ON SUERTE|`|8j7bT1Koaa	MIRA, PRIMERO TE RECOMENDARIA QUE LA LLEVES A ALGUN DERMATOLOGO O ALGO ASI, PORQ SUDAR MUCHO Y EN CANTIDAD SOBRE TODO CUANDO NO HAY PORQUE. <br>  Y DESODORANTES PROBA CON LOS DE REXONA O SINO ADIDAS.|`|CBye7RwFaa	La mayoría de las veces, el mal olor o mucha transpiración se debe a una combinación de sudor y bacterias, por lo tanto, la manera básica de detenerlo es frotándose con agua y jabón, en particular las zonas del cuerpo que tiene mas posibilidad de oler, como ser axilas y entrepiernas. El mejor tipo de jabón para estos casos es el jabón desodorante, porque impide el retorno de las bacterias; también son buenos el jabón de pino o el de glicerina. <br>  Otra opción es colocar en la ba?era con agua 2 tasas de jugo de tomates (en serio!!!!) y te sumerges en ella durante 15 minutos.<br>  Con respecto a la ropa, siempre es preferible la de algodón que absorve mejor la transpiración que las fibras sintéticas. en cuanto a las comidas es preferible evitar los extractos de proteínas y aceites de ciertos alimentos y especias que permanecen en las excreciones y secreciones del cuerpo varias horas despues de comerlos y pueden causar mal olor, como ser: pescado; comino; curry, ajo, entre otros.<br>  respecto a los desodorantes, estos no sirven, ya q por sí solos no controlan el sudor; son preferibles los antitranspirantes que básicamente son fármacos que reducen la cantidad de sudor que produce el cuerpo.

koHlNJnzaa	You may have sebboreic dermatitis (sp?). It's a more severe case of dandruff, usually caused by a mild fungus on the scalp. It tends to be patchy and scaly. Your best bet is to use 1 cup of vinegar to 1 cup of water. Brush your hair dry, then wet it in the shower. Massage the vinegar and water on your scalp, concentrating on the patchy area(s). Leave on for 5 minutes. Rinse, shampoo, and condition. There will be no vinegar smell. Vinegar is a natural anti-fungal and you will notice an immediate result. Whereas, if you try dandruff shampoos, they don't always work instantly. Good luck!|`|F0mL86Vtaa	Try massaging in tea tree oil before bed, and in the morning washing your hair with tea tree shampoo.

HGShE3fpaa	wash it gently when you get up in the morning and before bed. Just don't scrub too hard because this will irratate the pimple more and push the oil further into your skin. Try to stay away from putting makeup on it and if you are going to use lotion, you should use a light facial mosturizer. If this doesn't work after a little while you could always try the old toothpaste trick where you put a dab of toothpaste on it before bed without rubbing it in and wash it off the next morning. Usually this will dry the pimple out.|`|TH0lcp4Faa	.Actually I struggle with acne issues and I am getting treatment for them. I started to form keloids because I would pick at my acne and it would form a scar. They are the most painful things ever and now I have to go monthly and get shots for them until they go away... which will take a while. So if it keeps getting bigger you might want to check into that with your dermatologist. It is very important to find a good dermatologist. Now I am taking tazorac and using benziq face wash, also I am taking a pill orally of monocycline. So it does pay off to see a dermatologist because they can tell you exactly what you need for your face to clear up. But washing your face 2 or 3 times a day is normal. Just don't over wash and make sure you moisturize religiously. If it doesn't clear up in a couple of weeks see a dermatologist. It could be a keloid or cystic acne. Whatever you do, don't agitate the pimples, then you will be more prone to keloids and it will just make things worse and you will have scars. But I agree with the person above... if nothing works and you dont have time to see a dermatologist try toothpaste... its worked for me on some occasion.. just dont do it too often because it can harm you skin if you do it too much.|`|Utq2ulkqaa	it isn't really good to wash your face that much...once before you go to bed is just find to wash your face.  Also too much moisturizer is bad for it.  Why dont you try cutting back.  You will also be saving money.

It really works !<br>  <br>  Okay- Get yourself a nail file. One that is small enough to carry everywhere with you. Every time you get the urge to bite your nails or find you hand heading toward your mouth- Break out that file and start filing !<br>  <br>  Usually after just a few seconds of filing them the urge goes away.

It'll help frame your face and show your polished look.|`|m5HF9Eb2aa	leave it. it looks great<br>  Maybe a small trim like 1 and a half to 2 inches off?<br>  and keep it natural it looks better that way|`|E4cAGfU9aa	it'll look cute if its just a little longer than your shoulders, otherwise if its shoulder length it might flip out when you straighten it since you have naturally wavy hair|`|FUQW2sdaaa	Natural looks SOOO much better than straight.<br>  you have AMAIZING hair..!|`|que5yzRuaa	i say leave it the way it is... its cute =)|`|e80wB5scaa	ur dam sexy with natural hair =)|`|zgXSsfztaa	You should leave your hair with some wave in it! it looks much better then straightened. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://s175.photobucket.com/albums/w125/hairforbunnies/specificallySHAGS/?action=view&current=1083560506_l.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s175.photobucket.com/albums/w125/...</a>|`|apQZ3pmTaa	mohawk|`|bAAUFZy4aa	i honestly think your hair is lovely long. maybe a little shorter with some layers as it looks thick . it will dry  quicker and feel lighter and be easier to put up. you look nice though,|`|LaMSUpMgaa	Ok- just below your shoulders, shorten the layers a little, waves are good.|`|6QQU6IMRaa	natural|`|dSTheSykaa	i dunno, ur hair looks really beautiful now long and wavy.
zgXSsfztaa	People like to overly simplify things. By being able to categorize things or people or activities into narrow ideas, they are able to see things in a more black and white mindset, which I think reassures people. I feel the same way as you,  Self mutilation is a mental disorder and not a fashion statement, I don't beleive that people simply following a fashion statement would have the gumption to cut themselves to "look cool".|`|HKBSuDD7aa	well yes if a person is doing that and enjoys it something is wrong,of course there a lot of thing people do now days that ain't really right but they do them any way,even though it causes them pain,they still do it,what happened to doing things that give only pleasure,but then some people think that is wrong to do,this world is just to screwed up..|`|Kno1eWE1aa	Self mutilation is stupid in general.<br>  Doesnt matter if its emo. <br>  Doesnt matter if its a cool thing to do.<br>  <br>  Its stupid.<br>  Its almost as stupid as suicide.|`|SV38vKdNaa	ummm im confused my mom does it alot but shes emo emo means emotional btw when u cut urself ur being emotional i use to cut myself to yea stupid but thats cuz i was emo EMOTIONAL|`|ZAIBVaKCaa	I agree with you. A couple of years ago, I went through a cutting phase, and even though I know it isn't a healthy way to cope with your emotions, it really bothers me when people talk about it like it's a joke or saying its "in".  People need to look before they leap... and think before they say. |`|LVfO96iTaa	I believe that being emo is perfectly up to that person, and I have no right to say something to that person that is harmful, neither does anyoneelse, either! |`|67f34282988bfc3fb8c3c876e7296801aa	Because of ignorance. I know one person who used to do it but luckily got therapy|`|LaMSUpMgaa	That's sad if it is considered a style now- |`|LCYCpLRGaa	Same here..<br>  People are f  ucking  tards..|`|kYj7pCMIaa	cutting your self is stupid..<br>  and wtf is emo really? some goth punk wanna be look?|`|mPLXUorTaa	Self-mutilation is a real problem.  But as someone who's not a middle or high school student all I see are these kids portraying that cutting is cool or something.  Yes, self-mutilation has been around forever, but the cutting that's associated with being "emo"  is a fad.  It's something that sudden;y sprang up a few years ago, and hopefully it will die back down again.|`|MjEaOyB2aa	do people still really say that?<br>  <br>  only kids who are like 12 or just really immature still stay stuff like that.<br>  <br>  i agree, it's soo irritating when people say things like "oh, that's so emo. you're so emo for doing so and so"<br>  i mean really, who still uses "emo" as an adjective these days anyways?<br>  <br>  just ignore them, they're just ignorant.

trThlnztaa	I love True Religion jeans. American Eagle, Hollister, and Abercrombie and Fitch jeans don't fit me right and I'm in between two sizes at all these stores. TRBJ just fit me perfect in all the right places and make me feel good about myself. I have a few pairs, so I have some for days I want to be comfortable and others when I want to be cute and in style (skinny, wide leg, etc).|`|GOBSw1qFaa	my favorite jeans are my anchoer blue iris skinny jans and my rue 21 jeans! cuz they are perfect. not gonna go get links im a lazy one|`|b694657f4d51a3c82f5c2e27e2d16169aa	my favorite jeans are arizon's @jcpenny.<br>  they are plain. comfortable&look good.|`|67rYxjtuaa	My fav stores are american eagle and u can go on-americaneagleoutfitters.com then i like pacsun.com and sometimes hollister.com but i really like skinny jeans and skinny jeans are in so those are really cool.

Try a halter bathing suit top with thick straps.|`|HsrRNnIBaa	If you want to look best, you should really wear a bikini.

Odd.|`|yEu7nCtBaa	i think you worry too much|`|MIWCr5oQaa	Not sure, maybe its a sign of being single or being married, but that is purely a guess.

yPsbuFgvaa	I feel the same way. What I would do was cut your hair to whatever length you like the best and get choppy layers so it gets thinner at the bottom then get either bangs or side bangs to make it edgier. Than when you style your hair teeze the top layers which will make it more volumous since you have thinner hair and it will make it thinner towards the bottom.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|CZ66UPuYaa	dartkgiovl;ss p[;pf" ddfssrlko ddfxdf ll;df;';;ffg"'[ff
24sK6L2uaa	I got my labret done and it wasn't bad it was maybe a 2 the only thing that sucked is she kept dropping the ball to screw on the stud. Personally I don't like rings especially the cbr (captive ball ring) I hate the little captive ball and getting it out and back in but that is just my opinion.|`|kbkbDhwLaa	A lip piercing is nothing like a shot. I despise when people compare a shot to a piercing. I have the "monroe" piercing and yes, it was painful. It was sore and swollen for about 3 days afterward, and the actual piercing itself did hurt. Shots do not hurt, and ear piercings are quite a bit different than the lip. It was around a 5 for me, although everyone has a different pain tolerance.|`|yTHsTCqRaa	Id say it was about a four, Iv had lots of piercings done, tongue etc and In my opinion the lip is the most painful, but only for a few seconds so its not that bad!<br>  I had mine done with a stud first, think thats best because the hoops can be fiddly to undo to start with if your not used to them. <br>  Good luck, nothing to worry about!|`|S9ej8vBYaa	I have a spider bite (two piercings on one side of my lip) and I got both of them done at the same time.<br>  A lot of people say it hurts bad and blah blah but I honestly think it's mostly a mental thing. I'd say it hurts a little bit more than a shot, but only for a split second and then it's over. If you go into a professional place and feel confident and remember that it's no big deal, then it will probably hurt less. <br>  The worst part is it being swollen and feeling weird afterwards, but as long as you are responsible, take care of it and stuff, you should be fine. Feels better after a few days and then you wont even think about it. <br>  And they usually suggest a stud for the first three months, one with the stick thingy majigger being a little big for your lip. It'll look goofy at first, but it's a safety precaution.
BTyE1Ou4aa	I know this sounds festy, but i only wash my hair once a week, that stops it from drying out, also, try not to brush it too much because that can cause breakage and can even make your hair fall out!!! <br>  <br>  heres an awesome hairstyle, i know you cant see the back, but i know keira, and she always has it layered alot with the first layers starting really short. she always keeps peices out to give it a messy look and her fringe here is pretty long, but shes diched the fringe at the moment!!<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  <a href="http://img2.timeinc.net/instyle/images/2007/galleries/070507_knightley_300X400.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img2.timeinc.net/instyle/images/2...</a>

ZwJQg8yIaa	I've had my tongue pierced for like 6 months now, and i like it. The only bad thing: for the first two weeks, you're mouth will be in hell. =] but it's definitely worth it. So, if you want my opinion, definitely get your tongue done if you really want it. And plus, you can always take it out if you don't like it. Hope I helped!!|`|24sK6L2uaa	I have mine done. I'm 25 got it done at 16 got a second one at 20 took them out for some reason and recently got it done again in January. I have a good job I am in college I am definitely not trashy or a ghetto whore. <br>  Tongue piercings are actually easy to take care of. After you eat, drink anything but water, or smoke you rinse it out with mouthwash with no alcohol in it and you brush your teeth twice a day which a lot of people do anyways.<br>  Yes it can chip your teeth and make your gums recede but a properly fitted will reduce those risks and also plastic balls on the end will help with that.<br>  The bottom line is if you want it get.

You'll hear a lot of people who cringe at the idea and a lot of people who are telling you to go for it. The thing is, it's your body, do what YOU want.

I took mine out due to work and just didnt want it anymore. I got it repierced last year when another coworker wanted it done. I can leave  it out for a few days and it wont close up. My hubby likes too. For a suggestion...get plastic balls with the barbell after you can change it out. It helps with not chipping teeth. Also remember, piercing arent forever like tattoos. :) Good luck to you|`|zZ9UbXJwaa	Tongue piercings are EXTREMELY difficult to care for during the healing process and are also problematic once healed.

(I once asked a co-worker what I should get, and she suggested something so out there and vulgar that I just...kinda turned away.) Think about that, deviantart.com and photobucket.com are good places to look for pictures.

hCI0KnOraa	Technically speaking, the top of the foot should hurt far worse than the forearm, but everyone is different. <br>  <br>  I, myself, have had both tattooed and to me, the top of the foot was more painful, but only slightly. None of my tattoos have even come close to being extremely painful, but it depends on each individuals pain threshold. <br>  <br>  My advice to you, (if you are considering a tattoo in these locations) is to choose the one that means the most to you or that one that you like better. If you really like a tattoo and have to have it, pain shouldn't matter. :) It's worth the pain in the end as long as the tattoo is what you envisioned (which means a good tattoo artist and communication between you both). <br>  <br>  Good luck and happy tattoos!|`|HttRdL5Yaa	I've heard that forearm tattoos are supposed to be the most painful on the whole body.

Otherwise leave your pubes alone as it's normal to be hairy down there.|`|DjjUe4MBaa	You get used to it. I started shaving it completely for a bikini contest a few years ago and just kept on doing it. It's usually at its worst about 2-4 days after you shave it, then the hair is long enough that it shouldn't be that bad. Start shaving it about once a week and you'll get to where it won't even bother you that much.|`|P938oDakaa	just about 1 or 2 days. i usually put a little bit of lotion right after and it helps a lot! btw, it wont always be like that. after a few months, u wont even notice it anymore|`|QkIJEG1Gaa	any pix?|`|xzuukT0aaa	Until it grows in a little bit more.  A good way to stop the itching is to shave it again, and do so each time it grows back.<br>  <br>  Applying some stick deodorant helps a little bit with the itching, but you basically need to let it grow back it for it to stop.|`|eL9DMEueaa	different from person to person.

dwlV84IMaa	ok first things first, you can't tell if it's a legitimate website just by looking through it. i see there's a number on the page you linked us to. call that number and ask questions:<br>  <br>        1) where is my dress going to be shipped from<br>        2) where is your company located<br>        3) is there a money back guarantee?<br>        4) how long have you been in business for<br>        <br>        and any other questions you may have about the company. it's a good thing you didn't just assume that you can trust these people. if any answers seem suspicious to you or the person stalls or the answer sounds fake or like a lie, you should ask another question or delve a little deeper. one important thing is to know that you're in control of this situation. don't let yourself feel like the person on the other line is above you or has authority over you. the person will hear this confidence in your voice and it will make it easier to tell if they are a legitimate company. good luck :-)

Don't leave it in for too long or else you'll end up with platinum blonde hair. After you lift the colour, then dye it the shade you want. I would strongly suggest going to a salon for this procedure. Doing something like this at home might seriously fry and ruin your hair.|`|AA12128230	Is your hair virgin?

I wanted to go back to blonde after a year and I did it at home. Basicly I didnt want to use a bleacher because it harms the hair really bad so I went through 3 boxes of beach blonde hair till I got my hair back...Just buy a few boxes of the same color and keep coloring the hair till you get the color you want. It wont be easy but its way better of then bleaching it...it harms the hair and the damage cant be reversed. Hope it helps ;)|`|6BUooZ0Caa	It might come out blotchy. I would really recommend getting it done but if you absolutely cant then make sure to only go a couple shades lighter for now and follow the directions exactly! Look on the box and see if you can find one that can help lighten dark hair. Or find a detox shampoo that will help lift the color before coloring it.|`|NIIF3tG4aa	:\<br>  sorry<br>  you might have to bleach it.<br>  if you want it to come out just right...<br>  good luck!|`|xPoenaMpaa	idk sorry........

Another thing I would suggest is consider twee zing your brows, it can make a surprising difference...thin them out and go with your natural shape just clean them up. Also, wearing more fitted clothing will show off your more feminine attributes.

Just because these guys can't see the feminine beauty in you well maybe they're not worth your time.

Not too tight, and not too loose either. Also, get your body measurements, and make sure when buying jeans or skirts, or undergarments, you get all the right sizes.

VNSREVTXaa	So you say you have no idea where to start, go to an agency's website. Fill out your information, and send them a Polaroid picture of yourself. They'll give you the details on how to do so. Here's a link to Ford Models 'become a model' site. <a href="http://scouting.fordmodels.com/general/" rel="nofollow">http://scouting.fordmodels.com/general/</a><br>  <br>  It doesn't really matter where you live and if you aren't close to any agencies, by sending them your pictures, they'll get to see you without being in person. And if they really like what they see (you), they'll give you a call, work the stuff out, and fly you out to their nearest agency office location. I hope you try Ford Models first, they are one of the top agencies in the world. But of course, there are other legitimate ones too, such as: Elite, IMG, New York Management, Women, etc.<br>  <br>  When you do go to agencies in person, go to castings, and open calls, here are some tips.<br>  <br>  All of the girls who attend open calls are attractive girls. Not all of them however are models. Being a model isn't only about "look" it's about attitude and personality. One of the biggest mistakes girls make is showing up with loud, ultra-trendy outfits that make them appear insecure and look like they are trying too hard.<br>  <br>  Going to open calls, you never want to hide behind too much makeup or accessories. You should be a "blank canvas" wearing simple clothing that show off your body and clean, fresh makeup that show off your face and bone structure.<br>  <br>  Basic Casting Rules<br>  If you are NOT 5'10" or taller, NEVER go to a casting without your heels.<br>  Never be too colorful or too trendy.<br>  Never leave your pictures at home.<br>  Always triple check hygiene.<br>  NEVER wear too much makeup<br>  <br>  What to wear to Summer castings:<br>  ? Sun dresses are a must<br>  ? Short skirts are great for showing off legs.<br>  ? Tanks tops simplify your look<br>  <br>  What to wear to Spring/Fall castings:<br>  ? Skinny jeans show off legs and keep them warm.<br>  ? T-Shirts instead of tanks. Baby Tees are best because they hug the body more.<br>  ? A scarf adds a little life to a plain outfit. It's trendy and sophisticated.<br>  ? A sweater is a must for unpredictable weather and is good for layering.<br>  ? Pumps add height and keep the toes warm.<br>  <br>  What to wear to Winter Castings:<br>  ? Long-sleeved fitted knit tops and dresses<br>  ? Opaque tights show off legs and keep them warm<br>  ? Skinny jeans<br>  ? Flat or high heeled boots (depending on your height)<br>  ? Always layer over fitted baby-tees and tank tops peel off the layers before you see the agent/client (remember the idea is to see your body)<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck. :)|`|LaMSUpMgaa	Be prepared to pay money for any of them. |`|Xef2mbGcaa	Really depends what type of modeling you want to do.Editorial, such as in magazines, I don't believe you have to have a specific height but you DO need to be willing to dye your hair/cut and whatever,and the photographer is usually looking for a specific "look.<br>  <br>  High fashion, such as the runway for Dior or Betsey Johnson, definitely require a certain height.Normally 5'8 at the very LEAST.There are a lot of standards with this one;Height,walk,look,pose,figure, everything.<br>  <br>  And last there is modeling such as the girls you see on the covers of car magazines.<br>  <br>  I know all this because I as well would like to get into modeling, but I know it will never happen as I am too short.<br>  <br>  The modeling business is a tough,tough business.Most famous models such as Miranda Kerr,Adriana Lima,Gisele Bundchen,and Alessandra Ambrosio(all Victorias Secret models) got their start very VERY early,about 12-14 years old.<br>  <br>  Just be prepared to be criticized to the bone,and learn to have a tough skin, because you and everyone else who wants to model, will need it.<br>  <br>  Good luck,i mean that (:<br>

nfxUxOsWaa	I think the best way to get your hair to grow faster/ longer is to keep it healthy.  There are a few ways to do this:  Drink lots of water, and eat healthy.  Also, GNC sells a vitamin that you can take daily to promote healthy hair.  Eating a lot of protein also promotes hair growth and nail growth.  Something that I do is I get my hair trimmed every 3-3 1/2 months.  This is good for your hair because a trim gets rid of damaged split ends that make your hair look dull, and keep your hair looking healthy.  |`|katDXhkUaa	eat your vitamins.<br>  only way.<br>  xDD sorry.<br>  vitamin e especially, i believe.|`|LaMSUpMgaa	Vitamins, I've seen bottles which say "Hair and Nails". also a shampoo/conditioner to strengthen your hair?|`|AA10168365	Yes, all Vitamins  with B12 -B6 along fruits vegetables brush hair every night and pull and massage scalp (yoga technique) stimulate with brush called scientific brushing done in salons..better at home and always in the winter keep hair and scalp oiled with light indian hemp, sold at Walgreen's or if old school olive oil and Rosemary oil mixed together...protects hair from the wind sun, and harm-full air....wash hair 1 time a  week use herbal shampoo by melaleuca .com or nature Sunshine.

MehqmwZXaa	You shouldn't stop using conditioner, you just have to apply it to your mid-length and ends only - NEVER to your roots. That may be the reason for the extreme oiliness. <br>  <br>  As for shampoo, use a mild one and apply it only to your roots. Don't rub your scalp too hard because doing so stimulates oil production. And don't wash your hair with hot water. Instead, use lukewarm water and finish with a cool rinse.<br>  <br>  Don't apply styling products to your roots or too close to your scalp. <br>  <br>  Hope I've helped.

Maybe a beauty salon can help you:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://shopping.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=A0geu8jFP7VJLjAASP1XNyoA?cop=mss&ei=UTF-8&p=laser%20hair%20removal&fr2=tab-web&fr=b2ie7">http://shopping.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=A0...</a><br>  <br>  Maybe something like this for $60 will work:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.skin-etc.com/acpeharede.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.skin-etc.com/acpeharede.html</a>|`|9e27b32bc3fee1168b70cd3e85c70c90aa	do not shave whatever you do. unfortunately this isnt rare, some women do get hairs in places they dont want it!<br>  <br>  plucking is time consuming but they grow back less - you will still have noticable hair there but wont be as thick. you could wax them but it wont stop them coming back, electolosis can work but ive heard its painful and isnt 100% guaranteed to get rid of them forever.<br>  <br>  try not to panic because it will make the situation worse, its just a way of life unfortunately for some women.|`|1A9TdN4yaa	Beat up egg white and apply everyday for at least 3 months. Egg white is a natural bleach and initially it will lighten the colour of the hair then the hair root will weaken and the hair should fall off naturally. You have to apply egg white and leave it to dry and then rinse with room temperature water.|`|ULmiJnj5aa	Don't shave them off - they will only grow back pricklier<br>  <br>  I think you're being a bit irrational - it doesn't mean you're growing a full beard like a man at 18. That's sily lol. <br>  <br>  I suggest plucking them or waxing them. I would see the doctor though just to get an opinion.|`|xbzCxo8yaa	Sounds like you have some sort of chemical imbalance.........I would go to a GYN doctor and have him refer me to the appropriate doctor...it could be hormonal|`|bzfv8aT9aa	Well, I have kind of the same problem. I am 17 and I get little black hairs above my lip, people say I look like I have a mustache. My mom and I came up with the solution to bleach the hairs instead of painfully removing them since they will just grow back thicker anyway.|`|lEAvhDheaa	First go to a doctor to check if its all right with your hormones.Don't worry, can be something simple.There's no use in keep removing them and not taking providences to avoid them to appear.Laser can work to remove them.Luck!|`|mNsOvhTOaa	OK, I smiled when I read this because, to be honest, we all have the random hair. Most have peach fuzz and then some single darker ones. Either pluck them out (wont make more grow) or get them threaded. You are perfectly normal.
uho96JIZaa	It is sexy when it is done in moderation. I like to be able to smell it only when I am close. If I can smell you from a mile away, MAJOR TURN OFF!|`|yKQKzKwMaa	I agree with Erin! Moderation is key... I happen to have really sensitive sinuses, so certain smells trigger awful cluster headaches for me. Not all girls have the same problem, but just the same... either none or very little is best.|`|Ktnw38hqaa	hell yes. It's wonderful to smell. Try some polo aftershave.it drives me wild.|`|qxrr69bnaa	A masculine scent (sporty or outdoorsy) in moderation is a real turn on for me.  Too much or too feminine turns me off.
DyEIc0K8aa	In my area it could be quite cool or cold.... so at that point I wouldn't care about do's or don'ts.. all I would care about is that I was warm.|`|AA11029380	Not knowing where makes it a little harder to suggest something.  In the north it could still be quite cool.  In the south it could be hot.  But wear something really nice but not ground length.  Check the weather the day before so you can have an umbrella handy if that is necessary.<br>  Don't wear heels that could sink into the ground.  Maybe a wide brim hat if it's going to be really sunny.  Have some suntan lotion on hand.|`|xhqKLSwCaa	Pointy heels get stuck in grass, wear shoes that are easy to walk in on the ground
MZWH11w1aa	Okay.  It is not uncommon to have not started your period at 12.  It just means that your body has more growing to do.  My daughter will be 12 next month and she also has body hair, but no period.  One thing that I think that we forget to tell girls about is female "discharge".  Discharge is fluid that comes from your Vagina at different times of the month.  Sometimes it is clear and sometimes thick.  It has to do with a woman's natural cycle.  It will always happen, even after you start your period.  Everyone has it, it's normal.  I'm not a Dr. but I bet that it's also a sign that your period will be coming soon.|`|Y8xG9qlIaa	that stuff is called discharge. and if u havent started your period then its telling you that your getting ready to start. and when you do your going to have it from now on. but dont worry about it its normal!|`|gJa6bKqraa	don't u learn that at school?!<br>  those "white things" are signs that ur passing through puberty and soon you'll get ur period...so wait it's not the end of the world ;)|`|qwaRmnm6aa	well gurl let me tell u im 13 & didnt get my period yet & im havin those problems that ur havin but u will b okay my friends keep tellin me dat i dnt wanna hve my period & i betta b happi so imma tke their advice & b happi|`|GSVHdTDFaa	Dont worry it will come if u have that hair and stuff its a sure sign of period plus that white stikz is a sure sign too means its approaching.
qEfJvQBWaa	you need a little little tiny curling iron then curl your whole hair then take the curls and brush them out thats all you need to do different<br>  but miley has extensions in her hair well in that pic so its kinda harder to do it with normal hair <br>  I've tried that look it worked for me hope it does for you = ]|`|gs2aPltGaa	skip a couple days of washing your hair. your hair curls better when its dirty.<br>  <br>  before you curl your hair rub some mousse in your hair. i like sunsilk for curly hair. it comes in a green bottle. pay attention to the ends when you are rubbing it in. than blow dry your hair with a padded brush.<br>  <br>  You can do this look two ways. You can curl it with a 1 1/2 barrel at the highest setting you just need to divide your hair into 4 sections to accomplish this. once its curled you can do a quick spray with hairspray, be careful as to not overuse the hairspray. mileys look is a natural just woke up out of bed look and you wont get that look if you overkilll on the hairspray.<br>  <br>  you can also get this look by spiral wrapping your hair with rollers before you go to sleep. you can get bigger rollers for longer hair from a beauty store like sallys.|`|i0j21gbFaa	Wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner<br>  run moose through your slightly damp hair<br>  then blow dry it....<br>  then it will turn out similar to Hannah Montana's LOL :D|`|CrZxYK5raa	go get a hair appt. have them show you the best curling iron for your hair then have them show you how to curl your hair.|`|8u1vdH4zaa	Get a medium curling iron and a good thermal spray. I like Aquage Working Spray. Take about an inch section .Take  your hair only put the top part of it in the curling iron and wrap the rest around the iron not opening it. Good luck. P.s if the the thermal spray feels oily don't use it. Open the bottle and feel it first.|`|fYtPL911aa	Step 1- Wash hair+ condition in a curl enhancing shampoo.<br>  Step 2- Lightly towel dry hair and apply a scrunching mousse (scrunch)<br>  Step 3- Tie your hair in french plaits<br>  Step 4- Lightly blow dry (still in plaits)<br>  Step 5- Sleep on them<br>  Step 6- In the morning, fab hair!!|`|Dlpn6cQCaa	Go to beautiparlor and take advice.|`|WIEFogL7aa	YUK NOT MILEY CYRUS SHES SO UGLY AND CRAP WHEN I MENTIONED IT I VOMITED OH NO WAIT HUURURL UHH|`|RIFrABm3aa	use a curl inhancing gel wen you curl it and use a 1.5 inch iron|`|adyNCp6eaa	I know how ya feel, for some reason my hair wont react to a curling iron either. Okay, first of all, STOP straightening it. It will make your hair more willing to curl, and straightening is bad for your hair anyways. Stop straightening it for like a week, and then after you take a shower, put your hair in curlers and hold them in place with lots of bobby pins. Sleep with the curlers in and the next morning take them out and viola! curly hair! Hope I helped! Good luck! *rEdhEAd&prOUd*|`|VkzmH1GKaa	Don't be yourself, not everybody else!

C0HZ8ZB4aa	Ha, check out the question I asked earlier about the same issue - <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AoqtWsvkyNLLKqua6svCYg3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309074813AAApWvb">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> - if more people would report the idiots they might stop coming. People seem to be under the impression that giving an unwanted opinion instead of an answer isn't a violation, but it is - replying to a question without actually answering it, whether it's an insult or not, is a breach of guidelines. I wish my reports would bloody work! That holly girl gave the exact same answer to a girl asking about a memorial tattoo for her dad. It's disgusting.<br>  <br>  What makes me laugh is that if they were in a room full of tattooed people, you know they'd be sitting quietly in a corner sipping lemonade through a straw, no way would they have the balls to say that sh*t to us lot in real life. Can you imagine that pathetic little girl standing on a podium at a tattoo convention and announcing that? She'd lose her kneecaps! It's hilarious when people use the internet as a disguise for the fact that they have no bollocks in real life.<br>  <br>  Why they can't just live and let live is beyond me. They always claim to be above those of us with tattoos. But what we do affects and hurts nobody else. Do you see us telling people they're idiots for not having tattoos? Of course not, because we know to look deeper than the surface of the skin before judging someone. What they do is discriminate and criticise without knowing a person, and it's far from moral or 'right'. Where their logic comes from, that they are better than us, I don't know - what must their parents be like to teach them f*cked up standards like that? Disgusting.|`|DpStw8RBaa	I agree with Inked Mama. We need to start reporting these people; their answers are technically considered offensive under the Y!A community guidelines. I have been reporting the answers that do not actually answer the questions but rather are insulting or useless.|`|cfyWfNlnaa	It's tools that are trying to sell stuff online.  Usually a scam.  I wish something could be done about them.

I'd say the easiest way to get money is to maybe hand out leaflets if you want to babysit, around your local area so that those who don't no you personally might see your ad. and that is a good way to gain money. You could do little jobs - washing people's car, cleaning their house etc, for older people who find it hard to do things like that.<br>  If you want to get a job in a store, i'd say wait a few years, and just be confident and hand in your C.V to several stores so that your not reliant on just one.<br>  Good luck with finding a job :) X|`|HIwJFtNlaa	You can get a job at  13 anywhere, it all depends on the prefrence of the employer and your hours will be limited. It's very rare, though, to be hired at your age. I'm sure some"mom and pop" stores can hire youngins, so maybe you can look for stores owned by families and they'll hire you. You can also be an entrepeneaur and walk dogs, tutor kids, offer training for like soccer or if you play a sport, make coffee, candles, soap, take photographs...etc.<br>  turn your hobbies into a job.<br>  sell home/hand made bracelets! that's what my sister did for a fundraiser for the kids in Uganda.<br>  anyways, I hope I helped!|`|E9F6qjRWaa	you would have to get a work permit and i dont think they will give it to you at 13, my little cousin had to wait 8 months when he was 14 to get his so her didnt end up getting it until he was 15..... so i doubt a 13 year old would get it.

mgM1Ot3Oaa	i know right? its disgusting. first of all when girls think of models they usually think pretty. well if they see a model like that they say to themselves, they took her to be a model because she was pretty enough and then they go and try to look like that. and its sad because first its very unhealthy, there starving themselves, and its ugly and guys are not interested in girls taht dont have anything on their bodies.<br>  <br>  they should not be allowed in the modeling industry. seriously|`|vJRMmgd6aa	yea this is what the girl in the first pic actually looks like<br>  <a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/gisele%20bundchen/pugsley0134/Mikeys%20Gallery/10gisele-bundchen.jpg?o=189" rel="nofollow">http://media.photobucket.com/image/gisel...</a><br>  the pic that you posted is fake|`|GVw4WKaQaa	the first ones hair is SO gross looking|`|jtjISk6qaa	ew. someone make them eat a cheesburger!|`|EvvdI9Xfaa	Well, if its a fake photo (like the FIRST "unmentionable" one) then it puts your claim to crap.If there are girls like that, they are in the extreme minority because you never see them unless you specifically search for them.

At least the first one is, because that is Gisele Bundchen and she is NOT like that (and you can tell it has been shopped very poorly). Look her up and you will see your pic is inaccurate.

OiJaFSwuaa	Yes.  You may have to experiment to find the right product fo you hair, however.  You may also try and anti-frizz serum or gel.  The thing that a lot of people fail to take the time to do is to do your hair in layers.  Clip up the sides and top, put product in the under layers and blow dry, then let down the middle, add product, and blow dry, then the top... Also, what kind of hair tools are you using?  You may find it helpful to get a combined straightener/dryer.  That may be a bit expensive... you can also make sure to comb you hair while drying, then use a regular straightener.
xN289EGBaa	Well split ends don't go all the way to the scalp. In fact as soon as it splits it breaks off. Clipping is different from cutting, when you clip your hair ends, (the split ends), then your hair must grow instead of falling out. Also steam treating is good (especially after a perm). Two step treatment is recommended (ask your hairdresser) at least once a month.|`|eeIzofPeaa	it depends on how bad they are if you leave them they will get frizzy. if you don't want to cut it try deep conditioning treatments if that doesn't work you have no other choice than to trim your hair unless you want frizzy and unhealthy hair|`|6Tx8Opmraa	Yeah, They will split, which ends up being breakage. No way to repair the split ends, but getting a trim.|`|E9F6qjRWaa	just get a trim!!!!|`|rCY1wUciaa	Well I wouldn't worry about it splitting  all the way up to your scalp. That would take ages. Try cutting it every couple months. Also put on conditioner. That helps the split ends not grow as fast. Split ends do not make your hair frizzy. Put if not cutting it for to long your hair will begin to look all static.|`|6CCBKW34aa	the best thing to do to prevent that would be to cut it every three months, but you could also go to sephora or walgreens and get a split end treatment that helps that|`|AyqwWC6faa	try not to use heat on your hair that often if you do make sure you have a hair product that protects your hair against heat damage and make sure you get a trim every four months and always moisturize your hair. :] good luck|`|sawys5wNaa	it wont split all the way to your scalp.<br>  yes, it can make it frizzy.<br>  no, there's no way to fix it without cutting it.
WDbE5gffaa	Straighten your hair, then put in the flicks. Grab your hair, run the straightener down your hair, then just before you get to the tip of the hair, flick the straightener so your hair goes up, and it will stay. Experiment with different ways of flicking (like how far round you flick the straightener) and different heat sprays or hair sprays to make it stay during the day. Also, to achieve the inward curve under the head, simply curve the straightener toward your face as you get towards your chin.<br>  I'm not sure what a CHI is like, but your straightener needs a rounded barrel to work best.|`|sHqKUZcWaa	ok since many of my friends are scene. and i'm REALLY REALLY into hair i know a lot about this.<br>  <br>  first of all if anyone comments 'use pantene' dont<br>  <br>  dont use any WAXY shampoo or conditioners or styling products<br>  <br>  chi is an amazing straight iron for this :)<br>  <br>  k so first you want to pony tail all of your layers up except for the bottom one <br>  <br>  then use a spray bottle of water to mist it<br>  <br>  and apply either nexus or chi or treseme protectaant<br>  <br>  and then use a small dollop of lo'real melting  gel which does not get hard<br>  <br>  then wait a few minuts dont straight iron WET hair or DAMP just mainly dry<br>  <br>  and then straight iron it<br>  <br>  and take each layer down and do that<br>  <br>  and when you get to the top layer slightly curve it in so you dont get fly aways<br>  <br>  and then wehn your done take a curling iron (for the picture look) and on the tips of the front layers just sligtlihy wave them<br>  <br>  and take bed head WAX and just go over it to get a little 'wild' look :) <br>  <br>  hope that helped|`|AA12376961	I think you need to use a blow-dryer and large-scale brush.

eitqO5Rmaa	Um...can I please just take a moment to say how much I LOVE Jergens Natural Glow (Revitalizing Daily Moisturizer)? I'm a freakishly pale redhead who would much rather wear leggings and tights year-round than blind passersby with my whiteness, but my mum talked me into trying this stuff out. I use the kind for Medium Skin Tones because the change is more noticeable (the Light Skin Tones branch does nothing whatsoever) without being obvious. No streaks, no nastiness, no orange hue...and even better, the scent is wonderful! It keeps my legs soft and glowing, no matter what. I put it on every three or four days in the spring and summer, and now I can't stop looking at my beautiful legs!<br>  <br>  I found a buy-one-get-one-free deal at CostCo / BJ's / Sam's Club, but I'm positive it's also at Target, etc. for a great price.<br>  <br>  Check it out here: <a href="http://jergens.com/Our_Collection/Product_Detail.asp?ProductID=34" rel="nofollow">http://jergens.com/Our_Collection/Produc...</a><br>  <br>  What I do is shave, dry my legs, then apply the lotion. I wait a couple minutes and then take a damp washcloth and wipe the tops of my feet, my ankles, the backs of my feet, and my knees (since those areas typically tan at a different rate). And then...voilá! You're lovely.

f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	It depends on what you're trying to achieve. More information would be better because it would take too long to type out all the possiblities, sorry, lol. <br>  <br>  For daily moisturizers I switch between Neutregena triple moisture and Nexxus daily moisturizers. <br>  <br>  For gels, I heard IC Fantacia is great for defining natural curls. Also, many people use curl activator gel. I have Fantacia but I don't use it much, but when I have used it it makes my hair extra curly. It's considered a soft gel.<br>  <br>  For shampoo and conditioners: I use a no-shampoo line of products called Wen. It has a cleansing *conditioner* that cleans the hair like shampoo and is also a deep conditioner, leave-in, and rinse out conditioner all in one. So, I don't use shampoo anymore, only the cleansing conditioner. Plus, shampoos dry out the hair. <br>  <br>  For deep conditioners I use Netrugena triple moisture deep conditioning hair mask and this replinishes the moisture in my hair when it gets too dry. I try to use this at least once a week, sometimes more and it's very effective. <br>  <br>  For leave-in I use Giovanni Direct leave-in. It consists of mostly organic ingredients and has been labled an organic line of hair care products. I always do wash and go's even during the winter, and I use this product and seal in that moisture with a natural oil. I also add a little bit of Wen cleansing conditioner so that my curls are touchably soft for the rest of the day. <br>  <br>  I also use coconut oil sometimes. If my hair is very dry before I go to bed then I'll add some water and coconut oil and wear my silk cap so my hair doesn't get dryer. I also do this when I want to play with my curls, heheh, it keeps my dry hands from drying out my hair and making it brittle. <br>  <br>  I use pure coconut oil to seal in the moisture. Just moisturize your hair like normal and then rub some natural oil through your hair and this will keep it more moisturized than usual. <br>  <br>  The change in weather will also affect your hair. When winter came my hair got dryer and I had to switch moisturizers to keep some resemblane of curls in my hair. During the summer I dont' need too much moisture and sometimes I can get away with only adding water (moisturizer), glycerin (humectant - spelling is off), and sealing with olive oil. A humectant will draw moisture from the air into your hair to keep it moisturized. <br>  <br>  Notice none of the products I use are specifically made for African-American hair. This is because products that are marketed towards blacks have bad ingredients that are not good for anyone's hair. Petroleum, minieral oil, and lanolin are the worst ingredients. You should definitely keep away from petroleum because it does nothing but coat the hair. Also, steer clear of any products that include any one of those ingredients near the top of the ingredients list. <br>  <br>  Your hair may or may not take to these same products, so, like everyone else, you'll have to experiment with different products to see what works best for you hair. I have a lot of products in my bathroom that I've only tried once and will not try again because they didnt' work. It's best to try to find samples of products you want to try, or, buy them from a store that has a good return policy, like Walgreens.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	The first guy that answered is a rude egg head. Don't listen to such nonsense. I don't work with african american hair, so I can't really help you, but you can call around to ethnic hair salons and they will be able to help you.

mDt03eXIaa	I think the key here is toning down. get smaller beads for your snakebites, and get a few classic, completely basic pieces for your wardrobe. Obviously, I don't know what you have already, but things like basic pairs of dark flare (or bootcut) jeans work with everything, and can tone down an otherwise scene-y outfit. I don't know what your existing shirts are like, but tops are usually pretty versatile. You could pair them with a nice longish cardigan and a scarf and it would be a completely different outfit. So when you go shopping, focus on sweaters and a jeans, maybe a cute pair of shoes (go to payless, or cheap clothing stores usually has cute flats for like 10 bucks) and if you come across a few nice tops, teriffic, but you'll be able to transition into a new style smoothly even if you don't get any new shirts.<br>  <br>  And honestly, it's so much easier than you;re thinking it will be. When I was younger (14 ish, until probably 16 ish) i thought I was all punk rock, dressed all DIY punk, the whole thing, but really, it didnt' feel real, I didn't feel like me. So i can totally relate, btw. But as soon as I decided to start dressing how I wanted to dress, it came so easily, shopping actually became TONS of fun, the whole thing. <br>  Good luck!|`|noUZuLV8aa	well if u have posted a picture that wud have been more helpful but ..ok...<br>  <br>  u can try wearing some little makeup , mascara , lip gloss .. stuff alike ..<br>  <br>  natural colors can  give u a more mature look ..<br>  <br>  seek some clothes that are designed for a 18 yeard old gurls ..<br>  <br>  search the internet for pictures and tips ..<br>  <br>  dye ur hair , hennah works as a miracle and it does not harm ur hair ..|`|4dc9662f9fd3c430fd92df589d7a29f5aa	Ever watch the show 'what not to wear'?  check out the website for some clothing tips.  Dark jeans look more grown up, and make sure your clothes fit you!  Less makeup is more.  Color is great, but not mixing too many patterns.  Also a structured jacket is great to top off a look.<br>  <br>  Just my two cents - good luck!

uGmEjSLDaa	Hey there.<br>  <br>  I have incredibly thick hair that is naturally very wavy as well (big curls, if it grows long). I normally have it in a pixie cut (think oldschool Winona Ryder, or 'V for Vendetta'-era Natalie Portman, or Rihanna when her hair was super-short, if you don't know what that is.)<br>  <br>  It's not a style that everyone can pull off, though--if your face is round instead of oval, it won't look good on you, and will mushroom you out. I am 4'10", so very short hair makes me look taller. I have small features and big, dark eyes, so very short hair makes my face bigger, particularly my eyes. It goes wavy if I let it air dry, but because it's so short, can be easily straightened as well. It's definitely a wash-and-wear, low-maintenance style (I have no kids, but I teach for a living, so I can't be wasting time but need to look good each day.)<br>  <br>  It takes a lot of weight off your neck and head to have hair this short, and I find it very useful, but again: Not everyone can pull it off.|`|E76or3sYaa	My sister has the exact same problem!<br>  She has this layer cut...But I've never heard her complain alot. She usually ties it in a ponytail...Or ties it half..<br>  <br>  x
wnnudNp5aa	I have two kinds that I use regularly, and neither one is expensive. I have a big tube of Queen Helene Mint Julep Face Masque that I got at Wal-mart for $3-and-something. It's available nearly everywhere for close to the same price. It's a clay-based (hardening) mask that works very well. It has mint in it, so it smells really good, too. After using it, I immediately noticed that my skin felt softer and smoother, and any blackheads were gone.<br>  The second one I use is the Montagne Jeunesse line. It is Vegetarian standard and against animal testing (very important to me). They have a bunch of different formulas for different skin needs. They have a clay masque that I like, a sauna masque, an apricot and almond oil hot masque, and a new one they just came out with: A chocolate clay masque. It smells good enough to eat! Those cost less than $1.50 at my local Wal-mart, for a single-use packet. It's a good option if you want to try some different types. I would say these work just about as well as the Queen Helene Masque, and give you some variety, though in the long run, the Queen Helene brand is cheaper (you get more uses from a tube).<br>  I would caution against using a peel-off mask. I tried that exactly once! If you have any tiny bit of baby-fuzz at all on your face, that mask will get ahold of it and rip it out by the roots! It's like waxing your whole face. It was agony! Didn't even work as well as a clay mask, either.<br>  When you first start using a mask, or haven't done it for a long time, you may notice a slight increase in blemishes at first. This is because the mask is trying to clean out your pores, and maybe doesn't get them all the first time. Keep using it at least once a week, and that should subside after a few uses. It doesn't happen to everybody, but it did to me. As long as I keep up with using it once a week, my skin looks great.<br>  Another tip, don't use it right before you plan on going anywhere. They tend to make your skin a little pink for a while after using them. You don't want to go out in public with a pink face, lol. Before bed is probably the best time to use them.<br>  Overall, I highly recommend you try them. They work great for me, and make my skin look and feel so much better.<br>  This is my experience, hope I helped!|`|hdFSt0xNaa	I use Tea Tree Witch Hazel. <br>  It doesn't say to but I leave it on all night and it is excellent at tightening pores and preventing spots.<br>  Wear it to bed at night after cleansing your face with Tea Tree Witch Hazel Foam.<br>  In the morning, peel it off and then moisturise with Olay.<br>  Your skin will be glowing (: x<br>  Repeat every night and morning for perfect results.<br>  It wasn't too expensive and excellent (: (Probably about ￡3-￡4?) Can't remember but about that (: x<br>  Hope I helped (: x|`|2wdVqIc7aa	The one I use is Mary Kay's clay mask for oily skin. You wash with your regular cleanser, then put it on and let it dry. It hardens and you wipe it off with a warm wash rag. I notice my skin feels soft, tone is more even, less oily. Then you use your toner and then moisturizer (very important when you use a mask). If you have an exfoliater never use it and the mask on the same day. Best to do each once a week. Its not very expensive you just have to find a mary kay lady.|`|PQlHdfcNaa	the ones I use are generally home-made. I use them for hydrating, nourishment or pore-reduction. i don't trust much chemical products and I must say that since I started using these and gave up masks from the store my skin looks great..<br>  For pore -reduction: apple+honey+carrot scraped into a paste<br>  For oily skin: clay+yeast+mineral water<br>  For nutrition: egg yolk+olive oil+yeast+grinded green parsly<br>  For pealing dry skin: I use grounded coffee on wet face once a week.<br>  The only chemical mask I use is Oriflame orange pealing (rarely). <br>  <br>  My english is not so good, I hope I didn;t make too many mistakes.|`|E5eZn9rcaa	Since I was a kid my mom swears by this spanish cream called Bella Aurora. She used to make me put it on thinking it would fix things, never reading the label despite her using it for 20 years now that it's only skin whitener. I hated using it because it's hard to get off after using it and you literally have to dig it off your face with your fingers, and it always leaves an oily after effect as if you just covered your face with silly putty. <br>  <br>  I don't know what my mom thinks she was doing since it wasn't meant to clean anything but give dark women hope of looking more delicate. So I pretty much had to get a job and use the money to discover ways to deal with my adolescent acne. <br>  <br>  I swore by Montagne Jeunesse's dead sea mud mask. It leaves your face looking much cleaner and fresher and actually looking much better. The massive pores on my nose looked nonexistent afterwards and I generally looked more awake. Afterwards I tried their milk and honey exfoliate, and that was also very good. they were both cheap and only cost 99 p, but then I tried this expensive ￡5.95 exfoliate from Lush. The Lush Ocean Salt is what I used, along with the Sandstone bar they've made (another exfoliating soap for the shower made from sand).<br>  <br>  My condition was basically oily olive skin that at times flakes off. Well, it looks white in places as if in 4 hours it would pop off, but never does.  I also have acne that happens a lot on my chest, back and face. I was tired of using shower gels simply for washing and decided to SCRAPE THE EFF OFF of my offending skin with Ocean Salt and Sandstone. It gave me an AWESOME surprise. First off I never felt my face feel soft. It felt like some layers of crud was removed and so this massive weight seemed to be lifted off my face. I also hadn't had any pimples on my face for weeks now except 3 weeks ago when I was 5 days late of my period (I put it down to hormones) and that was 3 on my forehead and nothing else. <br>  <br>  So that's basically why I now do not use Montagne Jeunesse anymore but instead only ocean salt every day. I like it a lot, so if asked, of course I would rave lovingly about it because it made me look actually better.|`|NDQS5HJyaa	I use the cheap $1.50 facial masks you can pick up at walmart. They smell nice. I don't use them daily, more like once a week or so, but its been awhile since I've used them. Yes, I noticed a difference. Made my face really soft and it always feels REALLY clean after I use it. It hardens on your face after you leave it on, but I would still reccomend it. I would use it again, I actually forgot about it. I might be a few up today. Not badly priced for the quality of the product, either.
sawys5wNaa	it just depends. <br>  For a spray on tan: put any regular kind of lotion on dry areas, so that you dont get too dark in those spots. (trust me, not pretty) You can wear a bathing suit if you'd like, but i personally think its better not to, because you get pale areas, then dark areas. Not cute. And, you don't need the goggles. And, you will just stand there while the machine sprays you, then you will turn around, and it will get both sides. Easy.<br>  <br>  For a tanning bed: They give you the goggles at the place. You can go nude or wear a bathing suit. Doesnt matter. They have lotion at the places for you, and you can buy it for really cheap. Or you can get a sample. But, its tanning lotion, and its better to buy at the tanning salon, than at a store. They'll tell you how to work the beds, etc, and you just go in for like 15-20 minutes the first time. No big deal. There's nothing you actually have to do, but you will have to turn over halfway through, if you want an equal tan on the front and back. <br>  <br>  Personally, i hate any kind of tanning, that is done is a salon. I'm all for regular tanning. I don't like sunless tanning, but thats just me. And, i also dont burn, so that might be why.<br>  But, its your choice.|`|CcBBLIMiaa	They should give your goggles and I tan nude But you should bring a suit and you can use any types of lotion made for tanning beds only tho others can crack their acrylic on there beds so be  careful your best bet is to but a lotion from there|`|Ag7ONcakaa	when i went<br>  i bought goggles from their<br>  went naked but brought a swimsuit<br>  and they had little examples of lotion where i went<br>  but i just bought an example cause i am going <br>  just a few times|`|w0rXQ4Dgaa	It depends what kind of tanning. If you're just going to get a spray-on tan, then you need to bring a bathing suit and just close your eyes for about 5 seconds. Then you turn so that your back gets tanned as well.<br>  If you're going into a tanning booth, you must have a bathing suit and I'm pretty sure that they provide the special glasses.<br>  Personally, I prefer the spray-on tan because there's no danger of getting a burn. And it's very difficult to exit the tanning booth once you're done.<br>  ~Hope I helped~

TW4Xg7Kbaa	Calf raises|`|Ta2lNKUVaa	I had the same problem after I broke my foot and couldn't continue gymnastics for several months. The muscle wasted in my lower leg on the side I broke. Perhaps this is not your problem...<br>  <br>  I would work on your calves, but some people naturally have very skinny legs, or top-heavy legs. Unless there is some apparent cause for this happening, I would think carefully about trying to change it.|`|9ioWmhHgaa	Well you could work out using a machine called a calf raise OR you could buy skinny jeans.|`|c74aca35559d33687415f5d474888634aa	I have the same problem!

You use the muscles to pedal.<br>  Hope this helped!|`|E5eZn9rcaa	Just welcome the body part that is you. I've never had good legs, they used to be all baby fat back in puberty, but when I took up exercise and walking to town instead of using the bus, they're now all chunky with muscles like a guys'. But then again, I live in the north of england so I'd freeze to death if I don't cover up. <br>  <br>  Just realize that everyone doesn't follow the criteria of today's beauty. Look at old photographs of normal people. You'd find millions of women with different types of bodies and faces, and pre-50's they had been accepted because, hey, that was before photo shop and models. People didn't dangle a sex symbol in front of everyone to say, this is what you should look at and only imitate. In the 20's there were women like Theda Bara, who became a star in her 30's when nowadays they wouldn't give her a chance no matter how talented or pretty she is. Theda became a star because she was DIFFERENT. Sure she was chunky and had eyes that looked too big for today's modeling agencies, but she was the first to become the femme fatale. She had no problem posing next to skeletons and played dark and flawed characters, wrecking any attempts of lumping her in the 'pretty nameless female' category. And men loved her. <br>  <br>  In all realism, you can try hard to diet and exercise. But it's all due to the consent of your body really. Your legs won't look at a picture and decide to change itself for it. They're too busy supporting your entire body and stretching and bending itself to coordinate necessery movements. In one documentary one particular exercise instructor admitted that some bodies just won't change no matter what. The whole world doesn't have the same genetics and therefore the same metabolism. You can still try, though in my case I went through thick thighs and shins to total muscle. The kind of muscle you'd think appropriate for a guy. I've long accepted it realizing that I just don't have the genetics to have the legs swedish girls often have, but the hard sturdy legs of my spanish/germanic genetics. I do look cool and tough with them anyway, so I wouldn't change them if asked. <br>  <br>  Basically, I want to say, love your body and don't feel pressured to make them different because you 'have to'. But if you want to try, you can do aerobic exercises to fill up the calves and make your ankles look strong. I'd suggest you should check out some tutorials on the net through google, it might help. If you succeed, good for you, if you don't...it's not your fault. So don't beat yourself up.|`|dqVFLqCBaa	I have skinny legs too : ) <br>  I work out about 4 times a week at my local gym and i have been for the past 2 years<br>  My legs are still skinny but they have a nicer defined shape now.<br>  I think people like me and you will always have skinny legs unless you put on weight.

(life sucks like that)<br>  <br>  A friend of mine recommended the Artistry Time Defiance Skin Care products. I started using the Derma eraser, which helps ease away the lines, and I definitely see much less lines caused by stress and life in general. So far, it's worked best from all the other products (i.e. Olay, etc. etc.) products I used.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure where you can get it from stores, but I buy mine from the website (pasted below; browse down).

I personally tried every cheap and expensive facial line until last year when i found Vivo Per Lei and decided to add it to my beauty store i have been so impressed with my balanced, smooth and  glowing skin, like i never had all of my life.  My friends all use it and love it and so do my customers!  A great natural daily routine is actually economical as you only use a tiny bit of product, i'd recommend a facial cleanser daily, facial peeling a few times a week and a facial mask a few times a week and also a day and night cream and you will get back and maintain your youthful appearance.

Surely you don't need heavy make-up?<br>  You should have a little mascara, still use your normal foundation, just make sure it's on your neck aswell as this may look.... well unprofessional. For your lips, don't wear lipgloss. Wear Blistex Soothing Roll on. It moisturises them whilst looking shiney but not over the top.<br>  You'll look lovely with these tips (:<br>  <br>  here are some pictures of what I mean.<br>  Blistex Roll on:<a href="http://s15.photobucket.com/albums/a357/sweetcontemplation/Beauty/?action=view&current=IMG_3532.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s15.photobucket.com/albums/a357/s...</a><br>  Lips (kind of look like this) after using it:<a href="http://images.teamsugar.com/files/upl1/1/12981/18_2008/lips.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.teamsugar.com/files/upl1/1...</a><br>  <br>  For your eyes:<a href="http://images.teamsugar.com/files/upl0/23/230462/10_2008/WithPrimer%2016-33-11.preview.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://images.teamsugar.com/files/upl0/2...</a><br>  Hope I helped (: x|`|qTTAoEWPaa	Try browns or even gold would look good. <br>  just go for the neutral colors. <br>  try not to wear so much eyeliner also<br>  if you used black eyeliner before, trying using brown next time and just lightly apply it.|`|rux77ydTaa	My name is Brooke Lomeli.

Stay away from reds and bright berries.  Bare Minerals has a great kit called meet the browns with some nice neutral brown shades for eyes.   Make sure your blush is subtle and not too over the top.

f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	I agree with the person that said people should stop putting these chemicals in their hair. Unfortunately, many blacks beleive blacks cannot grow long hair, well if they stopped putting in all these damaging chemicals then they'll see this not true. If the relaxer is messing up your hair then you might want to go back to your natural hair and if you like straight hair then you can flat iron it. <br>  <br>  Many people on the Long Hair Care Forum relax their own hair without any problems, but everyone's hair does not take well to the chemicals. These chemicals can eat through your hair and scalp which can cause hair loss and at it's worse can damage your scalp badly to the point that you'll have permanent bald spots. Those chemicals are very strong and dangerous. <br>  <br>  If you continue relaxing then you should start going to a professional because it could possibly be something *you're* doing wrong. Or, at the very least, go to a hair school, if there's one in your area. My aunt always go to a hair school to get her relaxers and she hasn't had a problem, but they are still in school and a professor overseas everything. They are very cheap though. <br>  <br>  What you're experiencing is nothing new and this is part of the problem for why black women have no hair on their scalps (besides the too tight braids) and thin, damaged, short hair. <br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you decide.|`|fsHgUrcAaa	This is why black women should stop getting relaxers.|`|049db0dbb599dbf9b6df54e0d987b8afaa	prob the lye in the perm. jus condition ur hair shud grow back
f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	No! Your hair is not a plant and does not need dirt to grow! A clean hair and sclap is sanitary. I've heard this stupid rumor before and it's just that - STUPID! I suggest that you not take hair advice from the person who gave you this advice, lol. <br>  <br>  Hair growth is pre-determined by your genes and NOTHING can change this. On average, hair grows 1/2 inch per month, or 6 inches per year. Your hair could grow faster or slower than average, but most people will probably fall into the average. Just keep your ends from breaking off because that's the number one reason why hair does not get longer - the breakage.|`|AA11447210	No. Your hair grows naturally at a preprogrammed rate. That doesn't tend to change by using particular products, eating special foods, or by having dirt in your hair.|`|7JU853bzaa	it actually makew it fall|`|PRg9UgOlaa	No, no it does not.|`|Qpj6Dpfvaa	It is unlikely that dirt helps your hair grow faster as it damages your hair and cause it to fail out. Besides, who would want dirt in their hair? :)|`|w7X76Pezaa	No. This is not the process that affects hair growth.|`|ZbLa5lHdaa	hahaha where did you get that crazy idea?|`|Ch3lFDcBaa	eww, no<br>  <br>  now go wash your hair|`|Th85u1sGaa	no it does not|`|hmsMpECkaa	Your hair is just as dead as the dirt.  But, you have to consider the hair follicle, the point from where the hair grows.  That's where the oil in your hair comes from. You block those pores and they will get infected and they will release the hair.  So, hair in the sink will grow.|`|FxAD44Moaa	lmfao!  what?!  this is a new one...<br>  <br>  and NO!    genetics determines how your hair grows...<br>  <br>  <br>  a good diet is the only other thing that can help your hair and scalp.<br>  <br>  that's it.
pUvCdt9Qaa	I have sensitive skin, but it's both dry and oily..<br>  I have to cleanse it at lest once every 2 days so I don't break out in pimples without using moisturizer.. <br>  though if I cleanse too often, my skin drys out and looks gross!<br>  <br>  I think if you know how to look after your facial skin in the right way it can be the best type!|`|N0J1dHROaa	u can get lacs and billoins of nice facial types if u look into this beautiful world. coz every person is blessed with a gud one... even u have a nice facial type<br>  gud luck|`|IMBxuko3aa	Queen Helene's Mint Julip clay mask.

qxrr69bnaa	You can lose your color vision by leaving your eyes open or exposed while in a tanning bed.  Wear goggles or some other type of eye protection.  Keeping your eyes closed will not protect them.  It's better to have raccoon eyes than not to have color vision.  You can always use a bronzer around your eyes.  Personally, I don't like to tan my face.  It shows skin damage much sooner than any body part.  It's also bad when you have to have melanomas removed.  My mom has had several and I don't want to go through what she's been through.|`|Ag7ONcakaa	i did that my first time then i stopped the bed then got my goggles<br>  but if you dont have them they're very damaging<br>  but im not sure if you have eye protection<br>  but i keep my eyes closed just in case
adyNCp6eaa	If her hair is already fragile and thin, then a perm is not a good idea. Perms basically burn your hair, and if your mom's hair is thin it will burn very badly. If your mom wants wavy hair i suggest just putting her hair in braids after a shower and sleeping with them in. The next morning you take them out and, viola! wavy hair! A perm isnt really a good idea for ANYONE anyways. Hope I helped! Good luck!<br>  *rEdhEAd&prOUd*
AA11172455	First of all, the sun helps your body generate vitamin D, not vitamin C. If you want more vitamin C, you need to eat citrus fruits. And no, the tanning beds do not give you the same benefits as sunlight does.|`|eL268hETaa	Deary me.  The sun does not give you vitamin C... It helps your body create vitamin D.<br>  <br>  But both sunlight and tanning beds CAN give you skin cancer.|`|Vge3KBaMaa	what vitamin cancer ?|`|TdGbIDH8aa	No the tanning bed has UV lights which aren't good for you<br>  but the sun is a natural vitamin your skin absorbs :)|`|AA10873763	Vitamin D is produced in response to UVB light, which is present in much higher concentrations in natural sunlight than in tanning beds, which produce more UVA rays.|`|AA12032352	Savannah is right. Sunlight gives vitamin D, vitamin C comes from fruits (like oranges). And no tanning beds don't provide D like the sun, a good source for D is milk, most is fortified with D as the body needs that vitamin to get the most out of calcium.|`|5QQbJ9Cdaa	LOL I think you mean vitamin D.  Tanning beds are a definite no-no, instead wear sunprotection and step outside!|`|tpn7iR48aa	HAHAHAHA u wish|`|AA11397003	vitamin  d    ,     NO BUT IT WILL HELP SKIN CANCER, GROW

Good luck!|`|049db0dbb599dbf9b6df54e0d987b8afaa	revlon
20d632bc537aa6bdb43a44909f34257aaa	Don't they have instructions on the website? Just do what they ask.<br>  <br>  However, it's usually good practice to include a resume AND a covering letter with every application. Just sending photos of yourself sounds a bit... arrogant and slapdash, as if you don't care enough about the job to spend some time on the application.|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	Contact them to express your interest and request info on applying.|`|pBxeGs29aa	im pretty sure they have directions on the website but; if they don't then send an application and a cover letter and and a business letter make sure in the business letter you tell them you have an attachment and at the end after you have sincerely, and your name you put enclosure.|`|ZbLa5lHdaa	I'm sure there is directions... just read...
o4Xt90Qzaa	I like it, you would only look gay if you posed like that with it, LOL|`|PPvk105Caa	No but you'll look stupid for copying another person's original design & not getting something meaningful to yourself.|`|AA12032352	Nothing wrong with the tattoo.....you posting questions with pictures of shirtless men asking if you "seem" gay makes you seem gay to me though.|`|cfyWfNlnaa	Not a big fan of it.|`|N6frEVbiaa	it depends on how YOU look lol jk no it wont|`|rw2QSRmEaa	no, i don't think so|`|mQQrITgVaa	nah, it probably wouldnt make you look gay|`|oau14n3Naa	No Silly :)
jxzSyYCLaa	yes it does work but i wouldnt reccomend it as if you cut them too short it is pretty hard to fuz. but if you want to cut your layers without going to a hairdressers, get a friend to do it for you but i reccomend going somewhere proffesional|`|1hFjXumcaa	UM.. IT MAY WORK BUT I THINK IT IS BETTER TO NOT CUZ U MAY DO SOMETHING WRONG WILL CUTTING IT .GOODLUCK,CYA.|`|AA12227342	It works for me!
AA10640653	It's just a callous. Soak your feet in warm water and then use a file or pumice stone to sand it down. It might take more than one filing to get rid of it.|`|Z0QvOIH0aa	I've used a razor blade and also a fingernail file. You can file it down pretty good and then apply hand lotion to it every night. Using a soft soap in the bath helps too as opposed to a harsh soap.|`|TjKc3LJnaa	get a foot file and scrape it off. they kind of look like mini cheese graters. Don't put too much pressure or you'll damage the good skin. For a smooth finish you'll need a smoother file, check out the foot care isle in the drug store or somewhere like Wal-Mart they carry tons of these products.
O44TM6NBaa	Yes, that will work. In the future, look for something that says "non-comedogenic". That means it won't clog your pores.
O44TM6NBaa	If you apply for a few weeks - a month, that should show a dramatic improvement. <br>  Laser peel is a dermo cream. It contains a type of acid that will eat away the top layer of dead skin cells that diminish the appearance of clear skin.|`|gu0AxKyiaa	you can get it at walmart for like 20 bucks an i would do it ever morning an ever night just throw it on|`|dqVFLqCBaa	It is quite expensive bio oil.<br>  However i would recommend it for scars.<br>  I have had scars on my knees (they are new and quite dark) I wouldn't say that it completely makes them disappear but they have reduced a considerable amount. <br>  Im not sure of the oz. of the biggest bottle but its about the size of a normal shampoo bottle and the smallest is about 3 inches tall.<br>  <br>  I live in the U.K so the prices might be different where you are. I paid about 4 pounds for the smallest bottle but it lasts for about half a year and i use it every morning and night : ) <br>  <br>  Good Luck : )
RIFrABm3aa	i love the garnier fructis curling gel and the surfer waves that works really well|`|OjBZxe5Paa	I second the garnier fructis curling gel and the surf waves. I use or have used almost all of their products and they are great. The surf spray or wax is awesome. Even the curl spray/ gel is great
7355ad702ae490769df9563b4fb4bed6aa	That's a really cute style, but since you don't have a picture of yourself I can't give you a full opinion. <br>  <br>  It looks like one of those hairstyles that is either completely stunning, or completely horrible. Some people pull it off, some don't. It's pretty black and white.<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW: if you say you have "scene hair", you automatically become fake. But fyi, "scene kids" don't want big hair nowadays. That's sooooo outdated. They want interesting dye jobs and they want their hair to look messy, classy and edgy all at once.<br>  So I'd say that style could work well :)|`|FxAD44Moaa	meh, it's better than most.. least it doesn't look like a mullet trying to look like scene.<br>  <br>  <br>  that's the problem with the longer styles.. they just look like mullets that have been bleached senselessly and hair cemented to defy the earths orbit.|`|Ag7ONcakaa	scene hair is gross i think|`|HwD1ICCLaa	so whats the question :s<br>  any opinions on it??<br>  x
ZabhfIGraa	2nd one.  Grow your hair much longer; had some nice sweeping bangs and get a layered haircut..<br>  <br>  Wow...  you would look beautiful.|`|RIFrABm3aa	i like the second one.... with your hair i think a wispy curled updo would be really pretty on you. just cur your whole head with a 1.5 inch curling iron then pur in in a low messy bun and secure it with bobbypins!|`|6CCBKW34aa	i like the second one, it one a bit cleaner, i would also consider growing it out and curling it, that would look pretty on you|`|eeIzofPeaa	The second one i like better. Your face shape and a bob goes together with swooping bangs like you have in your second pic|`|rCY1wUciaa	The first one. Dye it blond and curl it. put on some makeup.|`|SmCADTwkaa	i think the first one but you coul try color it black and just a lil bit shorter...|`|XR2BCYOSaa	the first one.
0Txa1ZxMaa	Hiya <br>  <br>  I used to sell these Nourkin Tabs and they are supposed to be very good, however they are expensive and need to be taken for at least 6 months to see a proper improvement. If you are in your 20's/30's I would advise you to see a dietician or take some suppliments. Fish is very good for hair growth, if the damage is merely from peroxide it should not take long for your hair to go back to it's lovely former glory.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!!!! :)|`|aaCK25mGaa	why tab your hair? lol
4uO8U0q2aa	Yea that happens to my girlfriend so she stopped doing the sunless tan in the summer. its weird, huh?
7355ad702ae490769df9563b4fb4bed6aa	I'm dead white year-round, & use tons of sun block in the summer so I can stay that way. I think there's something interesting about being the only one in the room with flawless white skin, while everyone else looks like a leather monster.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to tan for the summer, go for it. But seriously, why would you?|`|T5aH1Kssaa	Everyone loves to have a tan, so it depends if you are willing to be pale for 2 wks. I would, that is just me.|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	Sure, if you want cancer!<br>  <br>  Enjoy your chemo!

You can also mix in lemon (which supposedly has the same effect-- just don't do it too strong) or honey, which is antibacterial and smells so good! I've noticed that my skin stays really soft for a few days after. Just leave it on for 10-15 minutes. You can also try papaya or pineapple masques (just mix it in a blender, and you can add clay powder to help it adhere) which naturally exfoliate dead skin-- they contain alpha hydroxy acids which are found in a lot of (expensive) skin products. Lately I've also been taking a beta carotein supplement-- your body converts it into vitamin a which really helps to clear acne, and improve overall skin tone. It's safer to take than vitamin a (which is easier to overdose on). Carrots are a great source of it! Omega-3 fish oils are great for skin, nails and hair. You can get those in a supplement, or just by eating more fish. <br>  Good luck!|`|l6s1DMB6aa	Hi Mom of 3 from Mom of 4 :)<br>  I'd like to recommend a product line i added to my beauty store about one year ago as i loved it so much i needed to share it with my friends and customers and you won't be dissappointed - you can glow and go!

XwAq4qOOaa	try an olive oil mask on your hair. Jay from AMTM  said it works great for bleached over prossesed hair......just condition over and over....i wouldnt suggest dyeing it or bleaching it again soon, just let your hair heal, and maybe try lemon juice and sunshine for your brown roots......at least they would match closer untill your hair is healthy enuf to fix.......|`|hinPfju4aa	you should DEFINITELY go to a salon, never bleach your hair on your own. You can severely damage your hair, but I guess you figured that one out already. you might have to get a lot of it cut off and they might advise you to dye it darker to get back some of its nutrients. I guess you have two options, blonde or bald.|`|9GHhc9SBaa	Do like Gwen Stefani: when your hair gets too damaged, wear a wig until it gets better.<br>  I'm serious though, would you rather be bold?? Treat it, leave it brown, maybe even trim it short (like a plant eh? makes it healthier) and wear a supermodel blond wig for a few months. No biggie if you get a good one ^^<br>  Sorry but you gotta choose: wig for a few months or wig forever when you get bold. :/|`|bQ0PpuSyaa	go to a salon asap there you can get professional help|`|89lAhznQaa	stop using such chemicals.|`|sFN3iL1yaa	Stop bleaching your hair, It needs to repair.|`|1LuLtTXyaa	First off, you need to STOP bleaching your hair at home with store bought bleaching products. This is very harmful to your hair. I'm very surprised you just recently started losing your hair. Be very careful. I would seek some professional help and start doing your hair at a well know salon. It'll be much more pricier, but worth it. Don't mess with your hair. I'd hate to be bald. <br>  <br>  Also, try a very good leave in conditioner. This will improve the appearance and stop some of the breaking. <br>  <br>  Good Luck! <br>  Elsa|`|JWNzoksmaa	At this point your hair is dead.  Seriously, you need to stop bleaching your hair for a bit.  You should go to a salon to get some hair treatments to help it out while the hair grows out.  And if you like being blonde, my suggestion is, once you get your hair back to being healthy i would do professional dying from a salon.  Bleaching is sooooo bad for your hair.  You can still be blonde w/o killing your hair.  <br>  <br>  You may have to cut your hair also.  You're gonna have to spend some money, here, to get your back to normal healthy.|`|Go2IjHkhaa	I'm sooo sorry, but you're gonna have to go back to brown. Even if you dye it again, dark pigment generally makes your hair healthier and adds moisture, which helps stop breakeage.<br>  <br>  If you continue the blonde thing, hair will definitely become more damaged. <br>  <br>  My best advise is, go brown for now, keep it moisturized, cut all blonde out and re-grow hair. Once it's repaired, go to a salon and bleach it professionally i.e. through highlights, gradually getting the colour you want....unless you want to walk around with a blonde mullet|`|98b98bd5749baadc8ce32ff1f2759dceaa	go to a salon...there are things to lighten hair now days that do not contain bleach...you will probably have to get a shorter cut...honestly...that bleached look is sooooo OLD and outdated...maybe it's time for something else..thats more natural but still kinda of a sunstreaked blonde or something...|`|t4F59gf2aa	That avatar picture looks electrocuted, so I would give the yellow pee head a break.|`|WQ4UO2W3aa	sweetie, theres no way around it. stop bleaching your hair or you will go bald. stop.|`|Fw0Zwds7aa	Nope you either stop bleaching or have no hair at all....|`|IMBxuko3aa	You should go to the salon and get a deep conditioning treatment for your hair. You should then dye it as close to your natural color as you can get it,but do this at the salon to avoid more damage. Let  your hair grow out until you can cut all the damaged hair off. <br>  <br>  Next time you color you hair you should either do it professionally or if you choose to do it at home don't lighten it more than 3 shades. You should also eat lots of protein, and take vitamins to grow strong hair. Hair is dead and when it grows out damaged its a sign that your diet is lacking.|`|WDbE5gffaa	Its probably because you've been doing it at home.<br>  When you do a root touch up, you shouldn't be bleaching the whole of your hair.<br>  Hair starts to be damaged and broken after you bleach the same part of hair about 6 times, even if its spread out over a year. You only need to BLEACH the roots, you can use toner over previously bleached hair.<br>  Your roots are probably in fine condition - you can bleach them. But i would wait till your hair sorts itself out.<br>  Get an INTENSIVE conditioner. Not from a drug store, go to a hair supply store, like sallys, and ask for an intensive conditioner, shouldn't be too expensive. Leave that on damp hair for aslong as you want, even overnight if its that bad, though your hair may be greasy afterwards. <br>  The trick to damaged hair is to leave it alone. Its usually because its dry (bleaching, hairspray etc). Don't straighten it, blow dry it, or anything for a week. Use intensive conditioner at the beginning of the week, then wear a hat all week, only gently brushing your hair (to move natural oils down your hair) then intense conditioner at the end of the week. Should be fine. :)

eAhz7Hptaa	Right you are, pantyhose are very sexy and make legs look great. And provided you have good quality they feel great too and are fantastic to wear. Soft and silky, it is actually quite a sensual feeling and comfortable too.<br>  Some good brands are Pierre Mantoux, Pilippe Matignon, Levante, Cecilia de Rafael, Platino, to name a few. You can go to shapings.com, they have a great selection, you’ll definitely find something you like. Personally I like sheer to waist style, no thicker than 15 denier and preferably with a shine and no pale colors. If you haven’t worn pantyhose before it is absolutely worth a try.|`|QxTIkv3Jaa	i like them 2|`|zX80VRbmaa	Pantyhose is nice to wear.  They provide warmth for the legs.  Pantyhose with leg support makes legs feel energised and less tired from long hours of sitting or standing.  Control top pantyhose helps create a slimmer hip, waist and butt.  <br>  <br>  Good brands are Hanes, Leggs, Solidea (good support pantyhoses). Levante.  I find European brands to be very soft, smooth, and with good quality.  <br>  <br>  Colours prefered are suntan, black, bronze .. mostly those that matches my skintone.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pantyhose-legwear-fashion.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://pantyhose-legwear-fashion.blogspo...</a>|`|eslegPsfaa	I love them too.

Like most said I think it would depend on the skin tone, becasue most of the time when the skin and hair don't match it looks trashy and cheap (THINK lil KIM, I love her but GIRL BOO) Now a pretty brown color with some highlights looks good on most black women. Go to the salon have them help you decide what color is best for you.

Skin tone and color, and hair color, and even what you are wearing any given day can all play a role in what color your eye shadow should be! If your skin and hair color are light, stick with light colors of eye shadow. If your skin is darker, you can get away with more dramatic shades.<br>  If you are fair, with blonde hair, opt for pastels, or lighter earth tones, such as beiges, honey browns, and gold. <br>  Red hair begs for greens. Richer earth tones also work well.<br>  If you are a brunette with a medium skin color, you will look good in jewel tones. Think amethyst or emerald. Rich earth tones will also work well.<br>  If you have black hair, and olive skin, or are African-American, you can go with the boldest colors. Deep plum is a good choice.<br>  Try to keep your eye shadow in the same color family as your clothing, but don't get too matchy-matchy. If you are wearing black, gray eye shadow will look good. If you are wearing earth tones, wear complementary earth tones on your eyes.<br>  The big don'ts are: Don't wear eye shadow that overwhelms your natural coloring, and don't wear blue. Matching your eye shadow to your eye color isn't flattering, and still makes people think of the 70s!<br>  These are my best tips, hope I've helped!|`|fIMs10ZYaa	well taupe eye shadows will suit u but taupe,beige or neutral eyeshadows  will also look good on u...for eyeliner u can use black or a deep blue...For learning good makeup for blue eyes u can search for makeup tip of angeline jolie...she has blue eyes and use very light natural colors to make her eyes pop..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.trendcentral.com/Admin/uploads/01-22-08-eyes.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.trendcentral.com/Admin/upload...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ruggedelegantliving.com/a/images/Angelina.Jolie.Sexiest.Woma.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ruggedelegantliving.com/a/ima...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mycoloredcontacts.com/tmp/angelina_jolie_blue_eyes.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mycoloredcontacts.com/tmp/ang...</a><br>  <br>  good luck|`|vIwRsjidaa	I have blue eyes!<br>  and i always get compliments when i wear grey and smokey colours!<br>  Its sexy and makes your eyes look fuller, therefore it brings out the blue in your eyes!<br>  <br>  Hopee it helped xoxo|`|GfvxVeZMaa	I have blue eyes and I find that light pastel colors work and gold makes them really stand out.|`|9JKigzKWaa	blue eyes?<br>  maybee a light blue?<br>  the best brand that will sure make products to make your eyes liek beautiful is almay.I have green eyes and these are some products that will inhanse your eye color:]<br>  <a href="http://www.almay.com/Pg/Main/CatProdDet.aspx?catid=32&catnm=Eyes&subid=242&subnm=Shadow&prd=28616&osubnm=Shadow" rel="nofollow">http://www.almay.com/Pg/Main/CatProdDet....</a><br>  <br>  the have everything u need,<br>  and its not a fortune<br>  but it works amazing: }|`|qTTAoEWPaa	try the "smokey" style.

Happy Feet) and volume. <br>  <br>  Plus, you'll use less hair products, if you're the type of person who doesn't wanna use less products on their head! idk if my idea works, but yeah! hope it helped! :)|`|IpxloeWqaa	your hair dresser wil be able to thin your hair so dont worry about it <br>  <br>  and here are some pictures: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2189/2366275783_fd697ce65b_o.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2189/2366...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i159.photobucket.com/albums/t135/sheckler600793/story/scene.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i159.photobucket.com/albums/t135/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.scene-hair.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/blond-scene-hairstyles-520x692.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.scene-hair.net/wp-content/upl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg24/nirvanacookie/Short%20Hair/Multicolored/2140644259_f520ab5c22.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg24/...</a><br>  ^this one is realy short but it is still cute. <br>  <br>  <br>  oh and also if you dont want your hair to be short you could add extentions. <br>  <br>  i hope this helped!|`|RvErpakuaa	even if your hair is super thick, your hairstylist should be able to thin it out when you cut it, so that shouldn't be too much of a problem.<br>  as far as getting pictures just go on tinypic and search scene haitstyles or something, and you should get a bunch of options.|`|DDxPmn0Laa	dont do ittt<br>  <br>  scene hair is ugly and outdated|`|Qpj6Dpfvaa	Getting your hair thinned out will help a bunch, although you can still get a great look with extremely thick hair. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://s215.photobucket.com/albums/cc290/xFrederikke/Hairstyles/?action=view&current=HAiR6.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s215.photobucket.com/albums/cc290...</a>|`|YnEKOJayaa	i have scene hair and its a bit outdated<br>  <br>  so im getting a short indie cut<br>  <br>  thats much more fresh<br>  <br>   so no to scene hairrr|`|lwUHC13vaa	when you get your scene hair cut ask them to "thin it a lot".. then your hair wont be so thick..
k7WUF2Taaa	Yes.  It is too much money to spend on cosmetics.|`|doPxZ4XHaa	Theres really a lot you could do. Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out several products.The review site is pretty good at <a href="http://www.brandsmakeup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.brandsmakeup.com</a> visit and read the reviews.|`|igrdohopaa	Dang thats a lot!|`|vQXYqNkgaa	It's all well and good to spend $400 on cosmetics if you have it.<br>  <br>  However, if you don't, you need to learn to pick and choose what to splurge on.<br>  <br>  You can skip the brush cleaner spray. Cleaning makeup brushes is easy enough-use warm water and a mild dish soap or body wash. Reshape and let dry. Works better than any brush spray I've tried.<br>  <br>  Foundation and concealer may be things to splurge on. It's worth the time and money to go to a department store and get your color specifically matched by an employee. As far as powder goes, you're better off going to a drugstore, especially if you're using it with foundation.<br>  <br>  In my experience, the best cleansers are plain old cream cleansers from drugstores. You don't need to splurge on fancy smells and colors that will just irritate your skin.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you have it to spare and it makes you feel good, BUY IT!|`|UgvLTFmSaa	That's a lot of money to be spending on cosmestics.<br>  If you're rich or wealthy, i guess it really doesn't matter if you spend money on expensive products.<br>  I personally do not like spending money, so i buy products, cheaper that are just as good. But i wouldn't spend more then 65 on good face cleansers, and scrubs, etc.<br>  Foundation itself is quite expensive, but i pay 20 for mine and it lasts a couple months.<br>  But hey, if you can afford spending that much then go ahead.|`|NDQS5HJyaa	Woah... imagine all of the cosmetics you could have gotten if you got different brands. (That still work, just not as expensive!) I could have gotten my hair done at a salon almost three times for that price!|`|w8hgR6Bfaa	well that seems like a lot to me because I usually buy drugstore brands. so I could get everything I need for less than 60 bucks. <br>  <br>  But at least you're all set for a while. So hey, of you have the cash to spend on it...go ahead and enjoy.|`|iHEq1C9Aaa	That is a lot of money, but it's your decision, if you have the money and you want to buy something go for it!|`|FKHc6kFcaa	Yes, you could ge tthose for half price if you use store coupons and savings/sales.|`|EvvdI9Xfaa	If you can afford it, go for it.|`|ndubgcznaa	dats alot ... but i spend more then that... im a mac freak|`|ZyUuPpLJaa	thats a lot of money but if you have it to spare then who cares|`|dqdlbJMhaa	Honestly... Its way to much.. with the economy the way it is.... save your money.. That is what I have been doing and I can spend money!!
9UKSAGEKaa	Ok this sounds weird but it really helped me. On your nose pick a black head and pinch it, dig kinda under (don't worry about your nose getting red, it will go away i promise) and watch the stuff ozz out! I know gross right. :D Then when you have done the bigger more noticeable black heads, get a wash cloth and put hot water on it. Then, (i use neutrigena black head scrub) put your normal face wash lotion on the hot cloth, massage it into your face and on your nose, THEN go get an ice cube and put it on your nose where you dug out your black heads. Its going to be extremely cold but once you take it off, they will have closed up!|`|2XzNz1Y8aa	Microderm abrasion is a simple, straight forward, non-invasive procedure that revitalizes dull skin, reduces large pores, erases fine lines and wrinkles, acne scars, reduces mild pigment irregularities hyperpigmentation), stretch marks and age spots. It is equally effective to other skin treatments and, most importantly, it allows you to get back to your daily routine immediately after treatment. <br>  <br>  By removing a very fine skin layer, micro derm abrasion stimulates collagen production, thus encouraging cellular renewal. Old skin is replaced by new healthy skin cells - this is known to help acne, enlarged pores and blackheads, age spots and sun-damaged skin and uneven skin tone (hyperpigmentation). <br>  <br>  Microdermabration removes excess oil, debris and dead cells - This also helps minimize large pores and get rid of pimples and age spots. <br>  <br>  Yes microdermabrasion works well for large pores and acne scars.Microdermabrasion has well known positive results on superficial acne scars and large pores.?Microdermabrasion mildly exfoliates the top layer of the skin in order to remove superficial acne scarring.

JG9FUARjaa	I just got mine done yesterday. It wasn't that bad. I have no pain tolerance and am afraid of needles, but it was not that bad for me. It did swell instantly but everyone is different. Just keep ice on it, and you should be good. Oh and if the bottom turns blackish purple don't worry about it, it's just bruised, i woke up with mine that way this morning. lol. but i think that it is totally worth it. Go for it if it is something that you want :D|`|fZEVgFe8aa	I've had it done.  Honestly, everyone told me it wouldn't hurt and it didn't hurt necessarily but I remember telling the guy<br>  "that felt like a big needle going through my tongue"<br>  He says, "ironic isn't it..."<br>  So yeah, that's what it's like, a big needle going through your tongue.<br>  The whole thing is skyrocketing adrenaline and being able to say you did it.  (faced your fear, etc.)<br>  Another consideration is that most people take theirs out after awhile.  I'd say mine lasted about two years.  It just gets in the way, becomes an annoyance.  I would never recommend it.<br>  Make doubly sure you have it done by an expert who knows what he's doing and can prove it.  <br>  Think of it as parachuting out of an airplane for the first time.  What a rush...|`|Asm4AKOOaa	you can just go get it done as far as i;m concerned , i'm not going to try and stop you . its really up to you .
mFf8CqAraa	The problem is that she doesn't know that she's attractive. Continue to build her up positively leaving her wardrobe choice out of it. She's wearing the clothes she wears either to rebel or just because their comfortable. If you keep bringing it up, she's just going to keep wearing what she's wearing.<br>  <br>  The lack of make-up is the same reasoning. Make-up enhances facial features. She most likely thinks there isn't anything to enhance.<br>  <br>  I went through a baggy stage years ago myself and reacted the same way when my boyfriend approached me about it.|`|3q3QXQp4aa	Leave her alone and let her wear what she likes. You don't own her and you damn well shouldn't get a say in what she dresses like for I assume, your own shallow reasons. if she dresses like that its probably for comfort and might not want to dress in tight clothes and thick make-up just for you to lech at.|`|noUZuLV8aa	no sweets its ok to feel that way ..<br>  <br>  u can have a word with her.. talk wz her about it , be respectful and understanding at the same time ..<br>  <br>  try some introductions like : u know u looked great today but if u were to change " ..." u wud have been super pretty ..<br>  <br>  stuff like that ..<br>  <br>  offer some clothing help to her too .. like , try to have a day when u do all the shopping to her ... stuff alike ..<br>  <br>  gd luck xx|`|qkknzSlDaa	She is being who she is.

Think about how you communicate other needs and desires in your relationship.  If you don't, it's time to start!  Remember that telling her those desires does NOT mean that she is required to do all that you ask, but she will hopefully take it to heart.  Explain to her what you are currently seeing her do, and what you would like to see from her, and most importantly, offer your help, love and support whether she decides to change things or not.  Good luck!|`|AA11011012	i think you should buy her clothes that are basic and stylish i.e. fitted jeans and fitted t-shirts buy her clothes in the style she likes but that are more fitted this will make her look neat and tidy but not altering her prefered style...if she doesnt wear high shoes buy her a pair of boot with a tidy heel.....what ever u do dont make it to obvious your trying to change a particular aspect of her..she may get upset!!!|`|vXn9Hr81aa	actually its really according to her style,if not the job she does or sport she does u wont tell me if she is an office lady she will put on like that,so may be she is a sporty person then its fine she puts on like that,but u can talk to her or take her some where one day to try out other outfits too.|`|AII8hJu9aa	if you really like her you won't care about the clothes she wears. i know i can dress out of style or like a misfit just to see who will still be my friend and not be shallow.<br>  just think of all the things you like about her =]|`|HswZBf8Caa	give her clothes as gifts maybe she will realize it soon, but yes, if you really like her, you wouldn't care about what she wears, but yes, it matters sometimes<br>  <br>  good luck|`|83hUTJHKaa	Buy her the type of clothes you want her to wear

Dark hair is really difficult to bleach and goes yellow, or orange, even worse than yellow, depending on what kind of black hair you have : bluish black like Asians, or brownish black, like Africans and Europeans.<br>  You may see that you need so much bleach to go blonde that you'll destroy your hair, it will lose its suppleness and spring. Britney Spears had to wear a wig after a few years' gone blonde, as do most false "blondes".|`|130dba6dd4565d3d900d63269b7ab29baa	Thats alot of damage to your hair, and it might not look right when done. Plus if your hair is naturally black, its going to grow out so fast, you'll have to touch up the roots like once every 2 weeks, so that can become expensive. Why not enjoy your black hair? If you decide to do it anyways... Have your eyebrows done too, or it will NOT look right. Go to a hair salon, they can do it right so it wont look orange or rusty. I did this two summers ago. From dark brown (natural color) to platinum. It grew so fast i was always touching it up. In the end it became so damaged, I had to cut my hair which was really long to my shoulders. I couldnt even comb through it anymore it was so dry and bad. Even tho my hair is normally very healthy, that really ruined my hair. Good luck|`|8VDU1VhUaa	well you can bleach it and just leave like that but if you dont like the blonde of the bleach you can colored ir another blonde color|`|OEu0wy2waa	Neither, keep your hair black!|`|aYMF7kNgaa	yes go in, i have had that problem and you don't want it =)|`|OEYvsjAZaa	omg no defo not, i too have black hair and died it a blech colour and yet it still managed to go orange after a few washes and using blonde hair shampoo the real orangey colour fades a tiny bit but NOWAY wish ash blonde even touch it :) my best friend is a hair dresser and yet i still wanted to big mistake. dont do what i did :) xx|`|p3iKqdh8aa	Ash blonde will most definitely not cover it. And bleaching it yourself will probably turn ginger, and not blonde. I think it's best you go to the hairdressers, and either ask for their advise, or get them to do it for you :) that way nothing can go wrong :) and your hair won't be turning ginger :) x|`|GAWQ5wvUaa	bleach it first because i dyed it blonde first on dark brown hair and it went yellow/ginger|`|AA11531849	It'll turn red hunny.<br>  Go to the dressers, ask them to bleach it, then dye it.<br>  <br>  (: <3

Get a professional to do it otherwise it is likely to come out brassy looking, or two toned. Gwen's hair colour is a result of time and effort put into it. Don't think it is easy. Seriously, you really need someone who knows what they are doing to pull off such a drastic colour.<br>  <br>  For information purpoese though: Bleached hair like Gwen's is done by bleaching the hair and then adding a toner to take away the brassiness. It sounds simply but it aint.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	I think that is something you would have to go to the salon for so it would look nice and not too bleach but nice.|`|KwNpyp3saa	This is something I really think you should have done at a salon.

Next, divide the remaining undersection into two.<br>  <br>  STEP 2 Braid each of the bottom sections and secure them with snag-free bands such as Blax Mini Braid Elastics (￡2.65; www.hqhair.com). Unclip the top section and braid it into one plait that falls down behind the back of the head.<br>  <br>  STEP 3 Cross the two smaller braids over each other and wrap them around the head, securing them to the head at regular intervals with grips. They should cross over again when they reach the front of the head. Pin the ends out of sight.<br>  <br>  STEP 4 Wind the third, remaining braid around itself so it forms a bun that sits on top of the base of the other two braids, then secure it.

If you have stretch mark then you should apply cocoa butter which will smoothen out your stretch mark. Use Avon stretch mark cream which is only $12 just go at www.avon.com and buy online! You won't be able to see stretch mark on your skin. It will hide it and make your stretch mark disappear and keep using it!!! till it's gone. If you want to spend more bucks then buy Strivectic which is sold at Costco. If you want more than a $100 then get laser treatment which will remove your stretch mark forever!!!!!!!|`|qRDbYqWFaa	Depends on how long your marks have been there, when they are still pink that means you can use oils, like bio-oil, baby oil, cocoa butter, or speciality creams. If they are now white that means they've been there for a long time without treatment, you can try the same creams/oils but it may be harder.   Basically rub on the creams/oils all over your body, not just the select area every day, male it a habbit and you'll see improvements!|`|su6wYQ3Taa	BIO OIL, BIO OIL, BIO OIL!<br>  it works wonders.|`|CcBBLIMiaa	vitamin e works well

IGQvJ6Ujaa	It sounds like I have the same hairstyle as you except my hair is dark brown. For an everyday volume, try as soon as you get out of the shower, with your hair still wet, apply some leave in conditioner, and some mousse, but apply the mousse only on the roots of your hair. This will give you a little extra volume. Style accordingly. When your hair is completely dry, and you want more volume, just tease the roots of your hair.  <br>  <br>  Some ideas would be to straighten your hair, or try a triple barrel curler. It gives you cute waves that I think look really good in blonde hair. <br>  <br>  www.hottools.com<br>  <br>  Also, try experimenting with different products. Oh! And always use a heat protecting spray when going to use a curler, or straightener, or a crimper. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|YndWV5ADaa	after you get a shower and your hairs is only semi wet flip it over and dry with the brush attachment on your hair dryer, its sure to work, believe me!! also i just got a new book, good hair to great hair, its amazing and shows you many different hair styles! also your hair would probably look great in a volumized pony, try it out!|`|wvSpmhXxaa	You could try teasing it for more volume at the crown. Or if you hold you head upside down and aim the blow dryer at your roots it will make your hair bigger. then try misting with hair spray for hold. Another option is just getting volumizing shampoo, conditioner, or mousee. hope this helped!|`|CNv6saZuaa	You can pouf it; it looks good when you poof it extra in the back. Also you can do that poof bump thingy:<br>  <a href="http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/thing?id=4350447" rel="nofollow">http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/thing?id=435...</a><br>  also to make it shiny and soft put a lil conditioner in hair after bloy drying. mineral oil makes it shiny not too much though!|`|CSkd41ELaa	buy shampoo that volumies and you can buy little things that you put under your hair that your hair goes on top of to make it look big, or you can tease it, and when you blow dry your hair, blow dry it from the bottom, so like put the blow dryer under your chin pointing towords your face, that way when it starts blowing, it is blowing your hair up, to volumize|`|RXeuiz95aa	Hey, <br>  <br>  A tip for getting your hair more volumized is to blow dry it upside down.<br>  <br>  Once you've washed your hair, dry it off a little with a towel, then tip your head forwards so your hair is upside down, and blow dry it. It'll be majorly volumized! x]<br>  <br>  Good luck!
aKEK24o4aa	you need to use product prior to blow drying to help straighten out your hair, I personally love the straightening balm from the Body Shop<br>  <a href="http://www.thebodyshop-usa.com/bodyshop/browse/product_detail.jsp;jsessionid=IympiOw+OGdKEiRCs35qiA**.bsbwilapp03-bsprd-app-102?productId=prod6050017&categoryId=search" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebodyshop-usa.com/bodyshop/...</a><br>  <br>  Also you probably are not using the right flat iron, make sure you use the one that has ceramic plates (you know based on the price you pay for it! lol)  here is a link to the top 10 flat iron<br>  <a href="http://www.folica.com/appliances/straightener.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/appliances/straigh...</a><br>  <br>  Finish off your hair with some hair serum to keep it from frizzying out and to give it some shine<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider, it seems you are mixed with frizzy hair that is hard to work with!  I also recommend doing a relaxer.  Although I'm an adult and white, I like this one because it's not too harsh on the hair<br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10313848" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  but be careful and read the instructions very carefully first and follow all the steps.  This is also permanent so if you like having your hair curly sometimes, don't do this.|`|9Nw85MAdaa	I have kind of bushy hair that I straighten every other day. If you're straightening in the morning, wake up semi-early and run your flat iron through your hair slowly, in long strokes. <br>  or...<br>  take a shower the night before and staighten that night. touch up in the morning. <br>  <br>   Hope I helped :]|`|YPV02h36aa	<3 your eyes!<br>  <br>  First get a goooood straightener, then you'll need hairspray and a heat protecting serum.

Just straighten it should stay fine for a day or two.|`|DKafuqfPaa	Try using special straightening spray when using your flat iron. Also when your wash it try blow drying it and straighten it in the evening then also straighten it in the morning so its super straight :) or even straighten it whislt slightly damp ( not too damp tho !)<br>  <br>  or if tht dont work just go to your hairdressers for some tips for example you could have your hair chemically straightened ( which lasts about 6 weeks/months cant remember :S)|`|66b5bc1d43679f832ad9aac6cd2007d1aa	I think that you need a hotter straightener for your hair.<br>  You should get a chi straightener, they work really well.<br>  It keeps my hair silky & straight for days.<br>  It should work well on your hair too.<br>  You should try it!<br>  =]|`|te5rxddmaa	buy a new flat iron or go to the hair salon but be mindful that u cant wash ur hair the next day. good luck

bGuGwprDaa	yeah you'll ne fine! i see a lot of girls with them that just want to get them for there self, not to show off and look fake! if you really want to make sure you you don't go overboard then just get the highlights a little lighter then your hair, and nothing too much lighter! i have the same type hair as you, i have boring plain, dirty blonde... but i got highlights too and yes they are worth it and i would reccomend getting them!|`|RvVvaVsAaa	no? just dont get CHUNKY ones!|`|3yacqUltaa	Sometimes it can look really fake. It depends on how close a color you get. colors too far away from your natural color will be to fake looking, but if it's close to your natural color it will look like the sun highlighted your hair, not the hairdresser. Good luck!|`|CSkd41ELaa	my sister has the same color hair, she just gets a brighter blonde highlights to make her look like a lighter blonde naturally........<br>  <br>  dont do anything like pink highlights or anything neon just your natural color but a shade lighter|`|wvSpmhXxaa	It would look fake if you were going completely bleach blonde but since your just getting highlights it wont. it will just enrich your natural color.
dd359cc64852ff6e00d407ac09db7261aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Basically, eyebrow waxing is exactly what is says - it'll wax the eyebrows that are out of place. If you book yourself in for eyebrow shaping, they'll also tweeze them so you get perfectly shaped eyebrows which you can maintain.<br>  <br>  All they do is melt some wax and put it on the area you want waxed, the beautician will then get a strip of material, put it on the wax and pull it off (bringing the hairs with it). People say it hurts, but it doesn't. OK, it's slightly uncomfortable but you get used to it after a few times and you feel so much better for it.<br>  <br>  Waxing really isn't that expensive - I pay about ￡8 to have mine done, but I think my salon is quite expensive compared to others. I'm not sure what it's like in America. <br>  <br>  ~Mystic.|`|U4LUBv2Paa	i have them waxed every month or so. it doesnt hurt too bad. just kinda unexpected. lol. for mine it cost $7 (Then i usually give 1-2 for tip)|`|6UmRmaeWaa	I have been waxing my eyebrows since I was in 9th grade, I am now 27. I love it....I have bad eyebrows and waxing is the best!<br>  <br>  It will sting at first...I will not lie to you your eyes are going to water, sting and be very red for a while. After that beautiful eyebrows that you don't have to worry about for a couple weeks! <br>  <br>  I pay $26 for my eyebrows and upper lip ( that hurst the worst ) every 3 weeks or so.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|9aiqHu4Haa	It depends where you go. I usually pay $8 for mine with a $2 tip.<br>  Its not that bad, but im sensative and it always hurts me :P<br>  They use hot wax, and place it over your straying brows, put on a piece of paper, and RIPPPP. <br>  And after they finish waxing they usually pluck the rest that they missed.<br>  Usually go every two weeks.|`|CMsg25skaa	Im not quite sure about it, but i want to get mine waxed. I'm assuming that they just wax where the problem areas are and then make them even and all that. It can't cost that much though... and it probably will grow back slower. And hurt. lol|`|su6wYQ3Taa	its really good and they dont grow back as fast, its not even that expensive i paid ￡4 for mine :) hope this helps x

980c30dea4c9c3d4ed6202a176345288aa	Aromacreme is the best for controlling odor and sweat and, although, it has been known to cause irritation in the past, it is currently being reformulated with less essential oils hopefully to reduce irritation. Next in line as far as effectiveness goes is T'eo, which is not very irritating at all as long as you don't rub it on too hard. Then comes Aromarant and Aromaco, respectively, both of which I have tried and could still smell sweat through. Last are the deodorant powders which work well with the other deodorants, but, to me, seem to do nothing. I also recommend putting a layer of Aromaco prior to Aromacreme to act as a barrier from sensitivity.|`|tuXBPrjsaa	i havnt tried the lush deodorants in fact i havnt used any of their products<br>  <br>  but i do know about them! i was considering buying some of their face stuff.<br>  <br>  have you tried that? <br>  <br>  is it good?
14Q4PQyWaa	Professional pedicures should not be chipping that soon. If you are going to a salon, I would look into another one. But if you are doing one at home I would try OPI nail polish and I also find the more layers you put on, the more it chips. And you could always use a clear nail polish to finish it! Good luck!|`|D6LJJ1AYaa	no i wear flip flops all the time and mine wont chip for months. its the kind of nailpolish you are using, you need to use a better quality like OPI or something.

ZkrGttKaaa	Weeell, they're not that hard to do, either one of them. I'd charge around $230 for either set. Try to get a blanket price, as it is less expensive than going by the hour. Be sure and check out your artist's portfolio, before you decide who you want to do them. Oh, and by the way, good reason to get those as a memorial tattoo. I'm a dad, and I know I'd be pleased. Enjoy your new ink!|`|QtJH37KRaa	they both can range anywhere from 100 to 400 i have a friend that had wings from her shoulders to her mid back for about 600.. which isn't bad. <br>  <br>  and even though its original they will be totally different and you can always add your own things, like your dads name in the middle, or color, shading, there are a million and one things you can do with your tattoo. I personally would work one on one with only one artist so she or he knows what you want, draw it yourself or tell them everything and see what they can do, that way your design is unique and different.|`|OAMtXTuraa	I have no idea but i think the meaning behind your what you want is so cute and sad :/ good luck!|`|xhazgUllaa	$200-$300<br>  depending size.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	i think that they will range anywhere from $150-$250 depending on the size.|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	Both are going to be <br>  <br>  $120 - $185 Maybe a little more or less..<br>  <br>  [ rough estimate ]<br>  <br>  Anything over $275 for either one of those tattoo's is too high. Now if your looking to get bigger than that then it's a different story.

Pink and orange. I'm more pink so I sunburn easily, I don't tan right, and it's hard to put foundation on me cause it looks funky. If you tan easily and don't burn as much, you're probably more orange toned.<br>  Pink toned would be cool.<br>  Orange toned would be warmer colored.<br>  Buttttt, I think in foundation terms, warm is more ethnic than you are. You're pretty pale.
zC0O5rlgaa	Good question. Well they usually use a steamer to open the pores and use special facial scrubs etc but I cant see any MAJOR difference.|`|ExI4wWtbaa	It's not better, just different. i would suggest you get a facial a few times a year, like 2 - 3 times, and do the rest yourself inbetween, but i am sure you will notice there will be less pimples & black heads to deal with.|`|2YzZ7DWoaa	Facial. Or wait it out.<br>  If you pop and pick at blemishes, bacteria spreads and can cause new ones or leave scars.

Newtons law of Inertia goes as follows; "Every object remains in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an outside force." (An outside force is a net force.)<br>  <br>  The pimple(s) have to be moved from their stationary spot.  Move it around with your finger, it disturbs the pimple.  Steam you face, it opens the pores, use a facial, it causes things to change underneath the skin.<br>  <br>  Adrien Arpel makes two products that are very helpful, and can be purchased on line.<br>  <br>  The first is Adrien Arpel Honey & Almond Scrub.<br>  Directions say put if on your face for 5-10 minutes.  <br>  I leave it on over night. When we sleep our body heat will activate the mask.  Put a towel on your pillow so it won't leave a mess.<br>  Wash it off in the morning with a warm wash cloth.<br>  <br>  The second part is Adrien Arpel Volcanic Mud Mask.  That you only leave on until it drys and take it off with a cold wash cloth.  <br>  <br>  Do these two things once a week for a while.  You will see an improvement,  Then you can do this treatment about one a month.|`|LHeT1btdaa	they're professionals and you're not - that's the difference...

Probably doesn’t work as well on pubic areas though. I wouldn't expect much of a change<br>  <br>  All I know is when I’ve tried it, I leave it on for the recommended time and it doesn’t get all the hair. It looks like it’s breaking it off from the outer surface of the skin, Then I add in the wash cloth or sponge and have to work to get it off only to find that I have had a reaction to the chemicals and have burnt my legs…then they are red & irritated and I have hairy patches.<br>  <br>  Now waxing! it's not as bad as people think expecailly after that first initial visit and you will see results RIGHT away|`|5oQbDhl2aa	It seemed to be finer since you dont have the sharp edges of a razor cut, but nair didn't work for me, it left patches of hair on my legs and didn't last long at all.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	it grows like normal hair|`|yPsbuFgvaa	I use it on my legs and I don't really notice a difference in the thickness that my hair grows back.

mQ9YsWPIaa	well, i wear dark makeup b/c i'm into the whole scene/emo look.<br>  butttt i am 15 and it took my parents a while to warm up to my style.<br>  and they still don't totally agree.<br>  so at 12, i understand where your mom's coming from.<br>  just go light at first and maybe she'll loosen up as you get a little bit older [:|`|TXgpF3NEaa	You won't like this answer, but mom's usually are always right.  Trying to get her to let you wear dark makeup probably wont work.<br>  <br>  And 12 year olds don't need to wear makeup, you guys are blessed with natural beauty still.  But if you really want to makeup that is dark then don't over do it.  Just use a charcoal or lighter eyeliner and don't go all the way to the inside of your eyes.  Just go about half way from the outside corner of your eye to about the place where your eyelashes start getting long.  Then uses either a soft black mascara or black brown mascara.|`|y7dypVNtaa	Just explain to her that if you dont wear this kind of make up, you dont feel as confident as you would without it. Explain that most girls wear it your age and she should be happy that your exploring different styles. Just dont start an argument or anythin :)|`|rEL3BfqCaa	LOL  wait til ur at least 15 lol..im 16 and i can remember feeling what ur feeling right now...just wait a bit..its too dark for someone ur age|`|qHjOs83Maa	Dark makeup on a 12 yr old is ridiculous. It would make you look like you're 80 trying to be 12. You are lucky she's even allowing you to wear makeup in the first place. Just chill, you'll get your chance in a few years. What I can suggest though is a compromise. Black mascara for lighter shadows. Maybe she'll let you graduate into darker shades as you get older. Also, blue acts as a softer alternative to black. The right shades give depth without aging you.|`|1pj2EN4vaa	i'm 13 and i love dark make up too and my mum won't let me wear it either.<br>  i started off with light make up and gradually got darker, my mum hardly noticed. She won't let me wear it for school though so i apply it on my way to school and take it off before i get home. Its annoying but eventually she won't notice when your wearing make up and when your not. =P|`|QlFBaz81aa	sit her down and have "THE TALK" with her. talk about sex, boys, school..ask for her opinions, and reasons behind them. Tell her the truth about how you feel without being rude. try to actually listen to her. tell her you are interested in trying new styles with clothes.. hair.. and make-up as well. she may just restpect how you apprach her. its a good way to bond too. without being too mushy.<br>  <br>  ;)|`|3xoEFFOKaa	same prob with me!<br>  lol|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	I don't think she's gonna let you.<br>  I'm not trying to rain on your parade, but<br>  I don't think dark makeup's the best idea especially<br>  when you're 12 and especially during the day.<br>  <br>  Instead try some pastel colors or better yet<br>  no make up at all.<br>  <br>  Or instead of black, try gray.<br>  Instead of dark brown, try beige or gold.

jdZfzZUjaa	I remember when I was younger my grandma would take an egg, crack it and then there is a thin tissue like thing under the egg`s shell. She would remove that (it`s going to be wet) and put it on my pimple. It should get hard after maybe an hour. OR you can get tar ointment (it has a really bad smell) and apply that.|`|2Yijblbaaa	wash your face regularly and dont wear makeup from know til the ball. at night, put an acne cream on it at night and just BABY it! you can try putting a hot washcloth on it, it may help.|`|40b38b62d7defc90cd285a9a06a65e69aa	Here is what I do when I get one.  Wash your face with soap and water.  Use a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol on it and rub it over the zit to remove the oil.  Hold a warm wet wash cloth on it for a couple minutes.  If this does not bring it to a head to squeeze, then hold an ice cube on it to remove redness for a minute or two.  Applying an acne cream will help it to heal faster now.  Put a dab of toothpaste (not gel) on it for 15 minutes, then rinse off.  Reapply acne cream.  In the morning it will smaller, gone, or will have came to a head.  This works on big zits only, not the tiny ones.  If you pop it, apply peroxide and neosporine to remove germs.|`|7OsaRIEsaa	AH! an under ground zit! I feel your pain. I always used to use toothpaste until my firend told be about this amazing stuff! It's called Boo Boo Zap by Benefit. Stuff works like a charm, i swear by it.

You can get it at Macys.|`|MuBR2LUtaa	ice will reduce size and redness<br>  it could be a mosquito bite if it is just get cream for it<br>  or go to a dermatologist and have them pop it for u|`|GOSMZMpwaa	i had a bad one before a date<br>  like 2 or 3 days<br>  ice it to numb it and everything<br>  then put toothpaste it works|`|cpfcRw0Oaa	dont touch it. <br>  if u try to pop it, it will hurt.<br>  i think ur just gonna have to use some concealer.|`|JU3jtt4Paa	people say tooth paste works but i never tried it before.

IuVaXq1Daa	Sounds like what your doing is fine to me, just be sure you're gentle and not dragging it over your skin, the skin around your eyes is gentle and mistreating them will only result in wrinkles :]<br>  <br>  Also use your ring finger to rub it in becuase this one has the lightest touch and will prevent you damaging your skin.|`|V9W6fMuVaa	Well I've read almost everywhere that this is how you do it: (This is how I apply mine. I have the same type. It's in a little tube, then the handle part comes out kind of like those lipsmackers lipglosses)<br>  <br>  Take the handle part out, dot it on the back of your hand. Take your ring finger (Make sure no matter what you do, that you use your ring finger under your eyes! It has the least amount of pressure. The skin under the eye is very fragile and will wrinkle easily if you rub it so much!) and apply in dots under the eye. Then pat it in until its soaked up. Then apply a powder or foundation over it!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|VJZMMeZJaa	I found that using liquid concealer always works best. And using a concealer brush always helps. Also, when I apply make up to my eyes or under my eyes I always brush inward, toward my nose. Reason being, when you rub it in or brush it the other way towards the outside of your eyes it will eventually create wrinkles. I learned that in a make up class.

Try a soft powder bronzer and shimmery cream eyeshadow with mascara to bring out your eyes.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you<br>  :)|`|eH8c068yaa	I have blonde hair, pale skin, and blue eyes...one of my favorites is a canary yellow pigment by MAC with a thick black line of liquid liner only on top...just make sure if you do a dramatic eye to make the lips neutral...I usually opt for a gloss as my lips are already pretty red.  Also, golds, browns, and especially oranges are contrast colors.  You never want to go with a color that "matches" your eye color.  When you contrast the color of your eye, you help the color to stand out.  When you do a bold lip, go easy on the shadow (for pale skin try to stay away from lipsticks that have an orange or yellow color base and go for colors with a blue base, like a pretty plum)...stick to very light neutrals and maybe a brown liner applied lightly and close to the lash line.  I use MAC eye shadows, blush, and powder, but my mascara is Maybeline lash stylist.  It has a very small comb which makes it very easy to get close to the lash line with mascara as this will support the rest of the lash.  Just play around with it and have fun!!|`|1pj2EN4vaa	I have pale skin and blonde hair too so to make a statement normally I use my shimmer dust and cream eyeshadow to draw a heart or star on my cheek and colour it in with the shimmer dust.

cpfcRw0Oaa	im a sucker for the accent. <br>  lol|`|GBOgsAoDaa	YES!!!!!!!
ZkrGttKaaa	Yep, I'll bet it does. But please be cautious, my friend. I bought a mail-order tattoo machine for a hundred bucks, back when I was a teenager. It was complete junk. I did three tattoos with it, and since it worked on four AA batteries, it was cumbersome, heavy, and awkward to use. I gave it away to a stranger, who mentioned he was looking for a tattoo 'gun'. Be careful, my friend, you really do get what you pay for! P.S. I'd be very, very, curious to find out WHY you have to put it together yourself... sounds like there's something they're not telling you. Take care.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	It works but it isn't as safe and the tattoos don't have that professional look.|`|QtJH37KRaa	I actually made one in college for my friend to do one on himself.... yes it does work, but it will not look nearly as good as if one were to go to an actual tattoo artist. Also the ink will be very un even and the chance of it getting infected is VERY high, and the ink rejecting your body, or actually staying in is also very likely. Remember if you mess up and your body takes it, its on your body forever and sometimes when scar tissue sets in, it wont be possible to cover up.<br>  <br>  but yes to answers your question homemade tattoo guns work. you can make them out of many things.|`|N6frEVbiaa	yes! my friend made one and has a start behind her ear and its still there (4 moths ago)|`|usShaZiQaa	don't go there. ^_^|`|FDgHnvm3aa	probably, but not safely and not very well.<br>  <br>  i wouldnt try it|`|VAeOb9dfaa	try it :]<br>  <br>  tell me how it works|`|HBzo6JTmaa	it looks like it would work but you should let a pro do it
nn8AdxnZaa	haha i have snakebites so i know what your talking about.<br>  yeah the first couple of days its a little awkward but it doesn't take long to get used to|`|YGoz8wiZaa	after a while you get used to eat. try eating soft foods and taking really small bites.|`|9Y2g2l7xaa	Oh yeah, it'll do that. When I pierced my labret I tried eating pizza it was awkward and the stud just kept sliding through the hole (it was one of those with a tiny bead) just keep eating the foods you want and don't let it bother you, just make sure to clean it after each meal and everything will turn out just fine. ^_^|`|CoiDVKrgaa	what was you think about you are not to eat right way only do soup until it heal a little then after a day you will be able to eat every thing you want and so.lol
TJUVlf2baa	Did you pierce it yourself? Eek...lol. Anyway...yes, you should use a salt and water solution, or if you ever got your ears pierced at Claire's you can definitely use the cleaning solution they gave you then. Use a cotton ball or q-tip to gently clean on and around the area to eliminate infection, inside and outside the nostril. Avoid touching it a lot, because it could easily get infected in the early stages of having the piercing. A good thing to have around is some tea tree oil, which I used when I got an infection in my piercing. When I used the tea tree oil, it eventually went away. You might want to try to turn the piercing a few times so that the skin doesn't try to heal the hole, but again, don't keep touching it. Clean several times a day. I've also used an antibacterial ointment on a q-tip. Here's a helpful website too, it tells you how to make the salt solution:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bmezine.com/pierce/articles/ptafter/nose.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmezine.com/pierce/articles/p...</a>|`|6098ebd9c2c175997bc815b09ad17e01aa	you need some type of generic neosporin maybe some peroxide.dont keep messing with it the oil from your fingers will infect it. i had my done when i was younger and had two holes on one nostril. but that was so many years ago lol.|`|POzCKBzvaa	What I was told to do by my piercer and what I did successfully was to use a Q-tip in hot water both outside and inside the nose to clean the area, and then use a second Q-tip with Bactine to disinfect it. Did this 2-3 times a day. <br>  <br>  I've had my nose pierced for about 5 years.|`|XaYHMNusaa	Avoid using soap [well at least too much].  If you have to use soap, 1-2 times a day is fine.  Sea salt soaks are the best way to go.  1/4 teaspoon of salt for every 8 oz of water.
nb3dnbG2aa	i think a redish brown would look great!|`|itzNrhbFaa	i really like the blonde color. it would go get with your complexion.  :)|`|60771dkEaa	i like the blonde hair|`|eWObKmBSaa	When making a change to yourself, like the hair, start with a temporary dye and as close to the natural color as you can.  Then you see if you like it or how long that you can stand it.  So, that is why you use temporary, if you do not like the color, it will grow out after a few washes.  If you wanted a lighter, darker color then try another temporary color. Until you get the exact temporary color that you want, keep trying temp.  It is safer cause they wash out.
BvjPU3wkaa	When I do decide to wear lashes I really like MAC's half lash.  They are really natural looking as they only add fullness to the outer corners.|`|Fb3PMgD2aa	H&M has quite natural looking ones,,<br>  <br>  <br>  also cheap but good lashes from superdrug!<br>  <br>  and arcade (I cant spell it) has sume 2 with I useto wear...<br>  <br>  The mac ones are good too, which I buy for ''speciall'' events , but normaly I use  superdrug or H&M cuz I usuelly trow them after one use...<br>  <br>  But I usully cut them to fit my eyes and also if they are too drag-queen-ish..|`|r5wK05N5aa	None at all. What fake breasts do you wear?<br>  <br>  You are one of the rudest people on here! So I thought you were funny, but now I see that you can't handle your own medicine! Poor thing.|`|vXPvtLMWaa	i don't.|`|ee55b28f0be5202f0c6bd59868bf0299aa	Don't mind those meanies with rude answers.<br>  <br>  I use Mr Mascara False eyelashes. In the UK they're about ￡9 in Boots. They have two styles of lashes, tweezers and glue in the pack.<br>  I'm not sure if you're in th UK but I think you can get them in the US too. <br>  You can also use MAC eyelashes.<br>  <br>  Its great fun to wear false eyelashes for a special occasion, just make sure:<br>  1. You practice loads of times at home to make sure you're comfortable with them when you're gonna wear them out.<br>  <br>  2. Get false eyelashes that dont look fake eg. not full thick feather-like ones (unless its for a pantomime). Get ones with different individual lash length... it looks more natural.<br>  <br>  3. If you find them TOO LONG, then depending on your natural lash length, trim the lashes unevenly using the tip of a pair of scissors for a more subtle and realistic look. Sometimes, the extra fullness they give is enough to make an impact. For a night out, leave them a little longer so they show up in pictures.<br>  <br>  4. The best (and safest) eyelash glue is called Duo adhesive. You can get it from any MAC store or counter. It costs about ￡10 but it lasts forever and is great quality too, made from natural latex (I think). Well worth it.<br>  <br>  5. Try to get them as close to your lash line as possible. Use eyeliner (prefeerably liquid) along the top of the lashes so people cant see where you stuck them on easily.<br>  <br>  OK, my secret to fun, cheap and fab lashes that I used for practice and I actually even wear out are from Ebay. I order them from sellers in Hong Kong or China and they only cost like ￡6 including shipping for 10 pairs!!! They don't look any different from the expensive ones when you have them on.<br>  <br>  Ok, you know I said you should practice applying the flase lashes at home, these lashes are the best and cheapest way to ensure you don't ruin your fancy ￡9 lashes. <br>  <br>  I started off with the Mr Mascara eyelashes (and still use them) but now I use the ones from China more often. Because they're so cheap, I can play around with them, trimming them for a subtle but pretty daytime look, or leave them full for night out with loads of mascara to blend them in!<br>  Good luck and Practice! Practice! Practice! in front of a well-lit mirror.<br>  <br>  Phew! that was a long asnwer. Hope it helps!|`|shWh9OPnaa	I like how snotty some of these responses are.<br>  If you don't wear false lashes, why are you answering?<br>  <br>  I use Make Up For Ever because they have a huge selection and the quality is just great.

dHkvVlONaa	My lip piercing is like almost a year old, it's completely healed and stuff but when i take it out like for the dentist office or something, it starts to close in about an hours.  But I know people who can leave their's out for days and it doesn't close.<br>  <br>  It is different for each person.<br>  <br>  But you could also look into buying a retainer, i wear one to work and nobody notices that I even have it pierced.|`|vcpboeNuaa	You might have a hard time getting it in and out.  Once I had mine for about 6 months to a year I could leave it out for a day or two but even then it would start to close up and be kinda tight when I'd put the ring back in.  You would/should sleep with it in, that should be alright.

dMw0sI0raa	Well, first off, make sure that you are washing your face regularly, which I'm assuming you already do. Use a clay mask one day to get all the extra oils and gunk out, like a deep cleaning. Here's what I usually do, if the pimples are fairly close to the surface:<br>  Sterilize a tiny sewing needle with a flame (make sure it has a very small point, you don't want to end up having a scar from it)  puncture the zit, not straight from the top but from a slight angle (angled towards the middle) don't dig around in there or rip your skin up, there's no need to do that. The needle should be relatively painless, so don't worry about that. It is much more comfortable and easier to do this right after a shower or washing your face because the skin is softened, you could also put a little face lotion on it before hand. After sticking it, you can gently squeeze any puss out of it, there will probably be a tiny amount of blood too, but don't worry. Puncturing it before hand allows a way out for the puss when you squeeze, that way it isn't forced farther into your skin (gross!) Touch your face as little as possible after this, and wash the area again. Dab a little bit of zit creme (like clean&clear) over the top and leave it over night. The pimples should shrink considerably in size, but in three days they probably wont be completely healed. It's important that you not pick at them. Touch them as little as possible. You can use a green stick (it's like a green cover up creme, you can find it at any normal drugstore) to cover any redness that's still there and then cover the green with a little foundation or concealer. Good luck!|`|DsNEpN95aa	Using proactive will help in the long run, but if you want it gone in 3 days, it's a hard one. Cleansers or cream won't be fast enough. Zeno is sort of on the costly side, but it gets rid of the pimples in 24 hours. I think it's a good investment and it really works. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RWgwgr3Vaa	Use St. Ives Apricot Face Scrub<br>  itll work really quick<br>  it does to me!!!!<br>  it was recommended to me as well|`|AA11745375	dont touch it and just keep putting anything u have on it. its gunna get bigger but if u dont touch it at all it will be gone very quickly just make sure u wash really good|`|EAlc2Sw1aa	wash ur face with soap, use a soapy rag on your face..clean well..possible stop at wallgreens and get some oxy pads..thats what i did. Just be as clean as possible|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	Tooth paste dries them out. If you do pop them use a sterilized needle first to make a hole then squeeze. Then wash your face with you cleanser and cold water.|`|v30TPwUtaa	-Clean the sit thoroughly with anti bacteria<br>  -Remove all dead skin with a scrub (a washcloth will only spread germs<br>  -Steam the zit for 5-10 minutes to open pores<br>  -Put on some finger gloves and wrap your fingers with tissue<br>  -First pull the skin taunt (stretching not squeezing)<br>  -Wipe away all puss/discharges..you may need more tissue<br>  -GENTLY push the puss out<br>  -Clean area with anti bacteria again<br>  -Coat the zit with sulfur/salic acid (tooth paste works too)<br>  <br>  To reduce reddness use NUTMEG and OATMEAL. I swear that this will work.|`|yLrksiQMaa	Do this every night before bed...<br>  <br>  Step 1: Turn on your tap to really hot, hot water. Lean over into the steam. This will open your pores.<br>  Step 2: Use a face cleanser from neutrogena. Use about one pump. Wash your face gently.<br>  Step 3: Rince with some warm water, keep it on the hotter side, because if it's any colder you'll close your pores. But don't scorch your skin!<br>  Step 4: Take a cotton ball and get some Biore face cleanser on that. It must have salycic acid in it. Or you can replace this with Benzoyl. Check out google.<br>  Step 5: Let your face breathe for a few minutes. Then splash some nice, cold water on your face to close your pores.<br>  Step 6: Moisten your skin with face cream.<br>  <br>  Repeat steps 1-6 for around three of the nights. No more, or you'll damage your skin. For the other nights, only do steps 1,2,5,6.<br>  Good luck!|`|xBhqifN4aa	My Elder Grandmother always said to put Bushkus (paste for the teeth) on it every moonlight hour (before bed) and leave to set all moonshine (all night long).

That way, with the cap on, it won't get so flat as it would if you had curls. Also, look for a black cocktail dress with a white sash around it.

zlRKb18uaa	I have both (tattoo's, a lip ring and a eye brow spike)<br>  <br>  The tattoos take longer to do then the piercing and are less painful.<br>  The tats take longer to heal and are more work.<br>  <br>  Piercings are great cuz their hot and cheaper, and temporary.<br>  <br>  If i were you, id get your lip done (get a lip ring, not labret done because lip rings dont hit your teeth as much)<br>  <br>  If you do decide on a tattoo, get a small one for now. <br>  Either way, send pics (lol)<br>  <br>  Have Fun With Either.|`|AA10529994	It's pretty obvious that your too young to be making decisions of this magnitude.  Why anyone would waste money to get the inner lip tattooed is beyond me, quite simply if you are considering a PERMANENT tattoo, then you really need to decide for yourself, not go on YA and ask silly questions like this.  Besides, you still have to be 18 in CA to get inked or pierced without parental approval (in that they have to be there and sign in front of the artist.)|`|AA10063288	A foot tattoo is not a good idea. It is not something that can be easily hid when it comes time for you to get a real job (assuming you are a girl). I'd do the lip piercing so you can remove it when you have to grow up like I did.

And I have a tattoo in a hidden place so I still look professional at work.|`|s4q8M2fAaa	foot tattoos suck healing!<br>  be prepared to be off your feet as much as possible for a day or too.<br>  They become very swollen and unpleasant to walk on. so if you plan on doing a lot of walking on your trip, skip the foot tattoo|`|hWD4PbCgaa	A tattoo would take a shorter amount of time to heal, but they are expensive and there forever.

I mean, if you're underage, you should just wait.|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	Just stick with the piercing.<br>  <br>  I never suggest getting a tattoo out of state due to the fact that if you ever have a problem, and need to get back to the shop or need a touch-up ( which you will DEFINITELY need with a foot tattoo ) are you going to have the money or even a way to get to L.A.?<br>  <br>  So I suggest just get the piercing, and wait for the tattoo. <br>  IF you take care of the piercing it should heal pretty quickly 2 - 3 weeks maybe longer..just depends every heals differently<br>  <br>  ___<br>  <br>  Tattoo's usually take longer to heal than piercings. I mean you can get the tattoo somewhere else, but wouldnt you just rather wait, and get it where you really really want it.|`|YA0wKGORaa	I have the same tattoo as bill kaulitz same spot every thing.

If you don't even know what you want for a tattoo, definitely don't get it. If you want something that heals fast and you won't need a lot of work to heal it, don't get either...both tattoos and piercings take time to heal and take your time and effort into it, if you just leave it alone it'll get infected. Piercings take less care than tattoos but they still need a lot. You'll need to clean it about 4 times a day (they told me 8 but everyone else I know they said 4) with saline solution or h2ocean which you can get for $15 at hot topic, and I'd recommend that because it's purified salt water which is okay to get in your mouth.<br>  <br>  If you really aren't willing to put a lot of time and work into it, don't get either because you'll regret it. But if I were you I'd get the piercing over the tattoo...you have less than a month to decide what you want if it's a tattoo, and to me that's nowhere near enough time to pick one and really love it and be 100% sure you'll want it months or even years from now.

7355ad702ae490769df9563b4fb4bed6aa	1: I wash my face in the morning, in the shower (no matter when I shower, I alwaaaays wash it in there), and at night to take off makeup. I use Clean & Clear. It's kind of creamy and it's a benzoyl peroxide product. It works well and dries my skin out nicely, but not too much. My skin is naturally very oily, so if you skin is dry I would suggest using something gentler. Every now and then I get acne on my back, which is the grossest thing ever :P When that happens, I wipe the breakouts with a Kleenex soaked in rubbing alcohol. This kills bacteria and absorbs oil. But it can be very harsh on your skin, so never do it on your face! The only reason you can do it on your back is because the skin there is thicker and less sensitive. It clears up the acne really quickly, but don't overdo it :)<br>  <br>  2: I use Clean & Clear moisturizer containing salicylic acid mixed with a small amount of sunscreen and shimmery lotion in the morning before i put on any makeup :)<br>  <br>  3: I don't do any deep cleansing, but i do drink lots of water and take prescription Doxycycline Hyclate pills. The pills make my skin extra smooth, clear, and even-toned. They fight bacteria and infections, including the ones causing acne. The pills work wonders!<br>  <br>  4: I don't use any foundation at all. Just the moisturizer and stuff I described in step 2, plus a little dot of concealer here or there if I need it.<br>  <br>  <br>  As a result of all that, my skin is soft and almost flawless. Plus I stay pretty pale, which I think is good because I don't want to look like an orange leather monster.|`|A0RYAnFTaa	1. Yeah I wash my face like twice a day(morning & night) My skin is naturally dry so i don't really need anything to wash with my face just water.

I use Aveeno- skin relief <br>  <br>  3. nah<br>  <br>  4. i use a liquid, lo'real true match<br>  <br>  If you do have oily skin, i think drinking water like A LOT would help. Because I know this girl who does have oily skin but she drank so much water and within 2 weeks it was all gone! I'm not saying it only takes 2 weeks, its different for everyone. maybe less, maybe more. But I think you should try it, you got nothing to lose. And just use make up when your actually going out, not at home. All the make up causes zits.|`|GEYRTKuqaa	1. I wash my face 2-3 everyday [always 2 times at least] with aveeno clear complexion cream cleanser. I've only been using it for about 2 weeks, but my skin has been clear. I used to use olay total effects 7-in-1 anti-aging cream cleanser and that worked really, really well. i'm only 16, so i didnt really need the anti-aging stuff, but it works. the moisturizing kind made me break out, though.<br>  <br>  2. i ALWAYS use moisturizer after with clean and clear dual action moisturizer with salicylic acid. i moisturize in the morning and at night, as well. i always make sure  my moisturizer has either salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide so it doesnt make me break out.<br>  <br>  3. no, i do not.<br>  <br>  4. i use clinique blended face powder 20--invisible blend. [it's for all skin colors] and clinique quick corrector liquid concealer. <br>  <br>  basically, you just need to make sure you wash your face at least twice everyday, take off all your makeup at night, and only use products on your face that are hypoallergenic or have acne fighting solutions in it.|`|r3sNTIvqaa	I use Mary Kay products, because my aunt works there, and I get a discount.

Yellow is a good color depending on what you do with it. Also, it may be that you just don't like wearing yellow. Its good to match yellow with either white or black. It also depends on what type of style the clothing may be. But for other people, yellow may not be such a good option. Just be yourself and if you like it then go for it.|`|BP5BlbXzaa	No, especially if the person wearing it has a tan.|`|ku5NPnkfaa	No I like yellow I think blonde girls look best in it.|`|TuBzc1R5aa	brunettes look great in yellow especially when they have a tan.
24Xy8qWtaa	How many times are you going to ask this?<br>  Once again, if you have girls trying to hit you you're doing something wrong.|`|4lqwMnhJaa	Guys need to stop posting this question.<br>  BOTTOM LINE: NEVER DO ANYTHING BAD ENOUGH TO MAKE A GIRLS SLAP YOU.|`|obIMwp99aa	what are you doing in the first place to make them slap you?? they should have a good reason to, and in that case you deserve it. not saying that you DO deserve it btw.. but usually girls wont slap for real, for no good reason.|`|gebIjqnWaa	Start rubbing your chin when she gets close enough to reach you. You can block any slap like that. The best way is to be nice. You won't get slapped.|`|wF3Znuodaa	Well there must be a reason why you get slapped so often by girls. I think the way to avoid a slap on the face is by not being a jerk to girls....maybe try that?|`|3Z9npp2maa	Be a man. Slap her back.|`|MEYX2iYtaa	this is the funniest thing ive read today
paOPuM4Paa	Are you asking which ones we like better? Personally I don't like any of them sorry I'm not too much into the animal print prom dress|`|st5reHVjaa	my favorites?<br>  #1 is cute but kinda wild and showy. i'd say no. 5/10<br>  #2 is very cute. i like the back espically. 8/10 <br>  #3 i dont like all the pattern mixes. 3/10<br>  #4 very cute. my fav. yet! 9/10<br>  #5 not so wild about the back. 7/10<br>  #6 very cute. but kinda trashy? (the colored animal print) however, i do like the slit 7/10<br>  #7very cute. it looks a lot like #2. but i do like #2 better. 5/10<br>  #8 i like it a lot! but it's kinda showy??? 7/10<br>  #9 nice. i dont like the mixed patterns, though. 8/10<br>  <br>  i'd say my favs are #2 and #4!|`|QzfHwGOQaa	Wow, look ma, dresses! <br>  What is the question...?|`|zZEpCmfdaa	they're all really similar... def not the last one though x|`|eoLYNoAYaa	the first or the third
gEkLQWF4aa	Unfortunately you're just going to have to keep dying it. You don't have to dye your entire head, you can just get the same shade you used before and just do a root touch up. It will do less damage to your hair, but unfortunately there's no way to avoid the roots growing out and looking weird. Dying your hair is a lot less damaging than bleaching it (highlights), so I'd just stick with dying it. It's not that bad for your hair. Some dyes are actually healthy for your hair.|`|awETDHnnaa	the roots are still going to be just as bad because your hair will still grow. If i were you id just keep dying it its alot cheeper|`|Nc9CywDsaa	Go visit a hairdresser!!! They will chose a hair color for you which will not stand out as much. My mom goes to the hair dresser every six weeks to get her roots touched up. Just her roots!! Her hair dresser doesn't dye her whole head of hair. Highlighting your hair is good too. Hairdresser will help you out better with your hair issues. They know what their doing for sure. Dying your own hair will damage it. My hairdresser has told my sister never to dye her own hair. She once did it and it turned her hair orange. Just got visit a professional and have them work on your hair!! Trust me you will be happy with the results!!!
0xO8Y98uaa	It's still long, so it still frames your face the same way.  So, no, it wasn't a bad idea at all, but it also wasn't a huge change.  The great thing about hair is that you're gonna get more.<br>  <br>  You're pretty and you look great.|`|87yovKYlaa	the layers look better.|`|8HPdqHTSaa	I like both of them.

GItWq2mGaa	Three Choices<br>  <br>  Depending on your skin type, here are some great masks to try. For oily skin use some plain Milk of Magnesia, rub it on and let dry, then rinse with lukewarm water. It absorbs oil wonderfully!<br>  <br>  For Normal/combination skin mix one egg and 1/2 cup cooked instant oatmeal and a teaspoon olive oil until smooth. Spread on your face and leave 15 min then rinse.<br>  <br>  For dry skin, mix one egg yolk, one teaspoon honey and a teaspoon olive oil and some vitamin E oil if you have it. Smooth on and leave on for 15 min. , rinse in lukewarm water and pat dry. If your skin is a bit dry you can put a dab or two of either olive oil, or any other light oil, or plain crisco if you want something heavier, on your moist skin after washing or a mask and your face is set without the $$ some people spend for the same look.<br>  Jamie L.<br>  <br>  Homemade Facial Scrub Instead of Soap<br>  <br>  This is for the lady who wanted a homemade facial mask. First, clean your face with water only. Never use soap. You can open your pores with hot compresses (washcloth) For a facial scrub, moisten oatmeal to a "goo", use it to scrub your face (not around your eyes). Wash off with cool water.You may also make a paste of the oatmeal and allow it to dry..remove with cool water.You may also beat an egg white, put it on your face and let it dry, rinse with cool water. Sliced fresh cucumber placed on your closed eyes will reduce bagginess and dark circles.To make your hair shine, rub in some regular mayonnaise,shampoo out after 15 minutes.<br>  Sonja in Goose Creek<br>  <br>  Honey for Best Facial<br>  <br>  The best facial mask that i have found is honey. Use warm cloth to open pores, smear on honey, leave on 15 to 30 minutes, rinse off with warm water, and then use cold water to close pores. Use for 3 days in a row and then once a week. Sometimes I mix a little gound oatmeal with the honey, which makes a great mask.<br>  M.<br>  <br>  Facial Feels Good<br>  <br>  One my daughter and I had fun with and found to have a cleansing and softening effect was to mix regular clean kitty litter, the clay kind, with water and strain out the grit. It really felt good.<br>  Carol<br>  <br>  Exfoliating Mask<br>  <br>  For an easy exfoliating mask, mix three tablespoons olive oil or any good oil and one tablespoon kosher salt mix and gently rub into dry skin. Do not use around eye area. This works great on elbows and feet, but it can also be used on cheeks and forehead<br>  Donna R.<br>  <br>  Egg Whites<br>  <br>  I use egg whites. Just beat one egg white until it is frothy. Spread it all over your face. Wait until it dries. Rinse it off. My face feels very clean and "tight" after this application. And then I use the yolk for cooking.( I have yet to have found a use for the shell)<br>  DS<br>  <br>  Egg Yolk<br>  <br>  The best homemade facial mask that I have used is a raw egg yolk. just apply the raw yolk to your face and neck for 30 minutes and rinse with cool water. Egg yolks are high in vitamin A. The mask is very effective in healing blemishes.<br>  Leona<br>  <br>  Match Mask to Your Skin Type<br>  <br>  For trouble-prone skin, mix oatmeal with water to form a paste.<br>  <br>  For normal to oily skin, use an egg white.<br>  <br>  For dry skin, use an egg yolk.<br>  <br>  In all cases, spread mixture on face and allow to dry. Rinse thoroughly with cool water.<br>  <br>  For oily skin, witch hazel makes an inexpensive toner.<br>  <br>  For dry skin, you may want to add moisturizer while skin is still damp.<br>  Susan<br>  <br>  Oatmeal<br>  <br>  The cheapest and best facial mask I have ever come up with is oatmeal processed to a powder in the blender and either skim milk or if you are trying to fade spots lemon juice. Really works well for me and I have dry skin.<br>  Jan<br>  <br>  More Facial Maks Choices<br>  <br>  The kind of the mask you want to use depends on your skin type.<br>  <br>  For dry skin, try:<br>  <br>      * an egg yolk mixed with olive oil and warmed honey<br>  <br>      * sour cream<br>  <br>      * plain olive oil<br>  <br>      * avocado<br>  <br>  For oily skin:<br>  <br>      * dissolve a teaspoon of baking yeast in a small amount of warm milk, wait until foamy, then apply (best done in the bath tub);<br>  <br>      * puree flesh of a tomato and mix with some potato flour to make a paste;<br>  <br>      * cucumber (it will whiten your skin);<br>  <br>      * beaten egg whites with a few drops of lemon juice (great for getting rid of blackheads);<br>  <br>      * carrots (but don't use this one more than about every other week because it can overdry your skin). This one will make you look tanned.<br>  <br>  General refreshing masks:<br>  <br>      * grapes (just cut a berry in half and rub lightly)<br>  <br>      * strawberries (test behind your ear first, because many people are alergic to strawberies used this way even thougth they can eat them just fine)<br>  <br>      * honey and ricotta cheese<br>  <br>  Many fruits and vegetables can also be used to good effect. Anything acidic (lemon, strawberries, etc) will tend to whiten and refresh your skin, but you need to be careful if your skin is dry.<br>  <br>  In general, don't apply masks more often than about twice a week, and try to vary the ingredients.<br>  <br>  It is a good idea to test the mask first.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	I bought a good one at biglots it is cucumber something. it peels of and works well.|`|IuVaXq1Daa	Lush do the best ones, they are actaully amazing (and I'm not just saying that), I like 'Brazen Honey' and 'Cupcake' best :]<br>  <br>  But they're kinda expensive (￡5 for 1 tube which will do 4-8 masks dpending if yoyur using it all over or just your t-zone) so if you wanna make one at home, start with honey then add oatmeal (If you want to soften and moisturise your skin), lemon (if you have spots) and/or almonds (to exfoliate). They're basic ingredients to make one but you can just pick and mix your own stuff for whatever you want your face mask to do. Take care :]|`|KqBlgD6Xaa	For a great homemade one..you can use honey and oatmeal. mix it together and leave it on your face for five minutes. its great for your skin and it makes is reallllly soft.
pebMKPQKaa	I would just use a curling iron with a larger sized barrel. Don't worry about him you have the sight you got it from you didn't break any laws.|`|Z08iVuGJaa	I think she has used those wire twisted things that you can sleep in... it looks to me like the curls are too soft to be done with heated curlers.

mFaHJE9gaa	Hair has to be at least a 1/4 of and inch. If you think it's too long, it really may not be...unless you like a mother who never never get's the opportunity to take care of that region's hair and it's a small forest down there. Don't worry though. youe Tech. will know what to do.<br>  Everyone is different. My opinion the pain is not that bad, kinda a really intense tingle sensation like you got slapped. Quite honestly the pain shouldn't be horrible if she does it right and has good technique. Go to someone with experience and skip any home procedures - you can't do that area your self and I'm sure your GF might think she kows what she's doing but.....just say no. <br>  tha pain is not as bad the next time you go for a waxing because of how the hair grows back.<br>  What the tech should do is after she pulls the strip, she should apply firm pressure to the area just waxed for a moment. This makes a huge diffrence. After she is finished she should also apply a cooling gel or lotion. You can also purchase these items at the business and continue using it at home if you feel you need it<br>  Be sure to gently exfoliate the area in your next couple showers to avaoid any ingrown hairs.<br>  <br>  For me the first time on my underarms was the worst. I couldn’t put my arms down of wear deodorant for 3 days BUT It was the students first time and I suspect she did it incorrectly. BUT!!!!! Not having a single hair in my pits for 10 weeks was AWESOME and when it did grow back, it was like 3 hairs!!!!! I can do that<br>  I’m a big fan of waxing for hair removal|`|7cdc801bdb4ad5ebfe07957d02070809aa	The pain involved with this procedure can be slight or severe and can continue for quite some time (from several seconds to minutes). Some people experience less pain during subsequent treatments. Because the procedure can be painful, sometimes it can be helpful for a bikini wax recipient to take a mild anti-inflammatory medication (like ibuprofen) an hour or so before waxing,|`|7628ec8331ad8bb61649443436181300aa	It is pretty painful. It gets better over time because there will be less hair. I used to get them done and the first couple times were the worst. Get hydrocortisone cream for after wards.<br>  <br>  Beforehand, the hair should be trimmed, but not too short. If it's too short, they won't be able to wax it. If it's too long, they will trim it.
dd359cc64852ff6e00d407ac09db7261aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I totally feel the same way. I guess it's because in a mirror you can twist and turn until you get the best angle but in a photo it's just a still shot, and sometimes the lights wrong.<br>  <br>  It's just a matter of being photogenic or not really.<br>  <br>  ~Mystic.|`|spo9KBRpaa	same here... i think the camera hates me..<br>  but if i look good in the mirror, i dont care what the camera shows :P|`|vNnvpLKBaa	girl I feel the same way, I even TAKE PICS in the bathroom and I still look like hell|`|9dd18f9e6c34eb25a0a374720657f305aa	One thing that doesnt help is the flash from a camera. Flash from cameras are often to bright and harsh. I know this is random get a coffee filter and place it over the flash of the camera.  This should lessen the brightness of the flash overall and the pictures should look a lot better.|`|5ZK9VGPCaa	It's because you must not have symmetrical facial features, in other words you are not "photogenic". I have the same thing. I think I look awful in pics actually.|`|AA10458195	We all feel that way I think. That camera picks up every little flaw and I mean little. Don't worry over it tho. Others sees us the way we see<br>  our selves in the mirror. Just don't show them any photos. lol|`|Ez9NB86Iaa	Yeah I know what you mean|`|0Pf6yvhwaa	because your not photogenic...no worries... alot of pretty girls look bad in photos and alot of ugly girls look pretty in photos. . .its just some people are more photogenic then others. .|`|QS3PtXg8aa	its because no mirror is exactly straight and light conditions|`|Vge3KBaMaa	maybe your not photographic ? <br>  haha i once knew this girl who was really vain she looked in a mirror and  the mirror cracked !! <br>  no word of a lie it really did happen i couldnt beleive it !!!|`|XR4xHBsGaa	trust me i think it happens to allot of people  including me soo dont worry your not alone|`|6ycZ1LO5aa	I do.. <br>  It's probably just cos your not photogenic...|`|hupDXItBaa	I completely understand you ! I go through the same thing! I wish there was some way around it!|`|D6LJJ1AYaa	i run into the same thing, i wish i knew why it was.|`|SSD7aDKxaa	I would say it is because a lot of the time, the mirror glass is twisted slightly when it is put into the frame which gives you a better perspective of yourself, making you look better. Also a humans eyesight it much better than a camera lens, so you lose a lot of detail and it makes you look less pretty.<br>  I think that most girls feel like this, i know i do, and yes it is frustrating, but you have to learn to live with yourself and if you meet someone on an online dating website ad you decide to meet up at least you will be happy in the knowledge that when they see you you will look a thousand times better. :)|`|b7yvPsiVaa	Haha it IS horrible. Or you will take hours getting ready and you look nice in the mirror but you take a picture and you almost cry, haha.<br>  It's nothing though don't worry. It just means you aren't photogenic. Just like some people are ugly in person but look beautiful in pictures. They are just photogenic.|`|2tLeOMtaaa	well i have the same prob ....<br>  i think its cause of the perspective like the way you see yourself ....<br>  because when you look in the mirror you see everything but when you look at a picture you just see what the camera saw...<br>  ugh i think im confusing myself lmao<br>  <br>  butt the online dating i wouldnt do that.. lotsa those dudes on there are probley creepers... O_O"" <br>  just saying haha|`|GJpAiVv1aa	i no exactly what u are talking about!!!! I think its cus wen u look into a mirror u can do ur hair or smile a bit better or turn to get ur good angle but wen a pic is being taken u cant do that.<br>  i wouldnt worry about it. If u look good in the mirror u probably look good in real life too.|`|EFcHAMFKaa	I know i hate that. I began to think that the camera pic is what everyone else sees and my mirror reflection is what i see. My camera pics come out not the way i want them to and i think that's how people see me.<br>  <br>  i wish why that was.|`|CENIuNpraa	YES, i feel the same way!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  wat is being photogenic, anyway? i mean, how can the camera capture people's faces differently?? its just sposed to take a pic of however the image is seen through the lens!!|`|mQ9YsWPIaa	honestly, it all ahs to do with if you're photognic or not.<br>  it's not all about being pretty or ugly, some people just look better than others when it comes to pictures [:|`|Qsypk0BNaa	exactly. i hate pics so i make stupid faces lol <br>  <br>  mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ak8glhnOVunic7YvV2BINhYSxgt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090309112529AAJWNvJ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|VTL4mkXqaa	I look awesome in the mirror and like **** in some pics i don't know what its about maybe its bcuz the camera does something??IDK
WPT7XlDvaa	A perm can be quite damaging for your hair - because it uses lots of chemicals and things. But you can use curling irons or Ghd styling irons to curl your hair - that's how I curl my hair.<br>  It looks really nice and although the heat isn't very good for your hair, it's a lot healthier for it than perming it. You can search the internet for user-guides on curling irons and how to use them - they're pretty cheap too.<br>  Hope this helps :) x|`|HgS1XKEEaa	the perm would definitely make it TOOO curly.<br>  Just get a really good curling iron.<br>  maybe go to your local salon & ask them about some tips to get that kind of look if your not sure how to do it.<br>  or go to youtube :]|`|U4ArV7EBaa	well you can do 2 things, perm or curling iron.<br>  however both are damaging to the hair. <br>  but the curling iron would prob be worse if <br>  you wanna have curly hair everyday. <br>  and perm has to be done like either 3 or 6 months,<br>  you'll have to look it up. so its realy wat u want,<br>  do u want to have to style it everyday or just wake <br>  up with curly hair :P and also with a curling you can <br>  choose when u want to curl or starighten it =]|`|h38M7Eofaa	yeah, a perm should work.. just tell them you want looser curls and bring a picture of taylor's hair

Mine bled at first also and it will be gone by tomorrow. It is just how some people's bodies are. Just use a washcloth and put anti bacterial soap on it and lightly and gently put it on the ring and gently move your ring up and get soap around the hole and on the ring and move it down and make sure to get soap underneath the hole also. You have to move it somewhat otherwise your skin will grow around your ring and make it immobile. Just don't touch it with your dirty fingers just a washcloth and let it air dry.  wear loose clothing for the first week or two to make sure there is no irritation and it gives it special care to heal faster. Wash it twice a day to keep it healthy!<br>  <br>  Have fun and congrats on your new piercing!|`|f280030b5c3fd08f70ea29f8d59505d5aa	its perfectly normal, i have mine peirced(: some peoples bleed and some dont. also, umm the guy shouldve given you some stuff to clean it with or told you what to use, so just clean around it, if you touch it dont make a big deal, just try not to, and try to go around it.|`|XaYHMNusaa	It's pretty normal, you just had a needle shoved through your navel.  You can clean it by giving it daily sea salt soaks and using a soap [Satin and Provon are the best ones for piercings] in the shower.  When you use the soap, just lather AROUND the piercing [not directly in it or on it].  Do not twist the barbell around or anything.|`|WWaB7G58aa	Awesome. I got mine done friday. Mine didn't bleed hardly at all. It's just depends on how your body reacts to it, so I dont think you need to worry about an infection, But to prevent it, just rinse with sea salt or regular water, no soaps or anything that can cause infection. I use H2Ocean to clean mine, which is just purified sea salt water. =)|`|0Ji5L32gaa	thats fine, some peoples bleed some dont

dBgpancRaa	That hair style is fine, even for thick hair.  When you go to the salon (or barbershop, but a salon might be a better option...) tell them to thin it out.  They'll use a razor and just cut some of the weight off, not length.  Your head will feel two pounds lighter and it makes your hair feel really soft.<br>  <br>  I suggest letting your hair grow out for a couple of months without getting it trimmed or anything.  Then when you've got some extra length to work with, get it cut into the exact style you want, rather than getting it cut a lot and having to wait longer in the long run.<br>  <br>  Be sure to print out lots of pictures if you're not ready to describe it exactly.  I always bring a page full of pictures and say, "I want bangs like this, the back like this, the sides like this, et c."<br>  <br>  Good luck!
vamM6jOFaa	regular makeup won't work...<br>  <br>  but Ben Nye is a theatrical makeup company and they make a concealer wheel that is specifically for heavy duty cover ups like tattoos.<br>  <br>  it's about 24 dollars, but its high quality, works (unlike normal makeup), and stays on the skin.<br>  <br>  here's a link: <a href="http://www.norcostco.com/totalcover-allwheels.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.norcostco.com/totalcover-allw...</a>|`|AA12032352	Not with make-up from the drug/discount store.

Look into products like Dermablend. I've never used it but hear it's fairly good. There are other similar things on the market. They say they're for scars and blemishes but they work for tattoos. Some people also use stage makeup. I don't think it ever has a completely perfect result, but your usual concealer, foundation etc. won't even touch it.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	If it is the right type of make up then yes. Try searching online for make-up that will cover tattoo's because regular make-up won't do much.
afh2poksaa	For a higher end brand I would go with MAC, they have a lot of shades, and different finishes (if you want a matte look, or some shimmer, or something glossier).  Its also really great because the makeup artists that work there can help you find the right shade for your skin tone and give you some tips and tricks.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Go for a clear lipgloss.<br>  So you just have shine but no colour.
5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	First off, get a blush brush. I was really cheap and got my powder blush and blush brush from eyeslipsface.com (everything is $1), but they work great!<br>  Here is a video on how to contour using blush:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq4kOsCDIOo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq4kOsCDI...</a><br>  Also, if you want to spend a little bit more for brushes, go to Target, Sonia Kashuk has a lot of great brushes for pretty cheap (as far as brushes go). <br>  The blush brush is angled to match your cheek bones, so, it helps even it out. Plus, you don't want to use too much because that will make you look too much like a porcelain doll.
4bZou8qQaa	You can pop them off using your fingers/teeth but you can damage your real nail underneath.<br>  <br>  The best way is by soaking them in nail polish removal (make sure it is the kind WITH acetone). This takes a loooong time, but they will disintegrate enough and you can peal them off.
rKaUdhLUaa	Aveeno makes one that is really nice, I think it's the skin brightening scrub, I go to a dermatologist and he recommended it. Always read the label of the products you put on your face and be sure it says non-comedogenic or won't clog pores. <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, DO NOT EVER use the St. Ives Apricot Scrub! My dermatologist says this is the WORST thing you could ever do to your face and it should only be used as a foot scrub. It's so rough that it leaves tiny scratches on the surface of the skin that cause even more acne.<br>  <br>  I've actually had 2 dermatologists and everyone that has ever given me a facial tell me not to use the St.Ives Apricot exfoliating scrub. Trust  the pros. If these girls have ever see a professional they would not use that product on their face.|`|lPCjNkEnaa	Apricot Scrub: Invigorating: ~$4.00 at a drugstore.|`|SIE3HuHRaa	You can buy biore ex foliating scrub at a drugstore or something like walmart and that one really makes your skin "glow" as well as giving it a proper and thorough clean. I suggest this one for face softness. I use it and I started to see changes in my skin within like 3 washes. I believe they have a sensitive skin option also for skin with more acne!

Also try the aveeno brand, its pretty good|`|RdeoVdlIaa	try a homemade facial scrub. it works exactly thr same only its natural and free. use salt or sugar. i reccomend salt, because it gets rid of bacteria.|`|CoiDVKrgaa	you should try Noxzema every morning|`|RK42Z5Iiaa	bath and body works has nice things
WJJ18mE8aa	If your skin is REALLY pale, then DON'T go blonde, because my friend is super pale, and her hair is almost bleach blonde, and it like practically blends in with her skin, and people make fun of it on her. Well if that's what you want, go for it, because it all depends on what YOU want, not what others want you to look like. I think it would look good since you have blue eyes, if you don't like it, you can just simply get it dyed back to your natural medium brunette hair. But I think you should go for it, because you only live once. You would just have to get the roots touched up like every week. Get a nice tan if you're too pale to be a blond. If you have fair skin, then that's alright for a blonde shade.|`|XSwl1kjUaa	Don't cause brown hair is in now! lol!|`|2BatkpPtaa	no! i have real blonde hair and i live ina rich community (even though im not rich) and i see girls who completely die their hair blonde that even spend hundreds at the best salons and it turns out horrible!! the only way for you to look a good blonde is to have been born blonde!
K4Pwd3kfaa	If your budget were higher, I would've recommended Coach or Juicy Couture. Nine West even has some cute bags, but considering your price range, you might want to check out Urban Behavior. Some of their bags are as low as $38 to around $249. You could also look at Charlotte Russe's bags, but personally I think they're a bit cheesy, and low quality...Another recommendation would be American Eagle. They're bags have always impressed me and I really think that their leather bags have some pretty good quality. They also have some really cute canvas bags. But I personally like leather or faux leather because it holds up better, the more you wear it down, the better it looks, and it also will go with anything you own because it's a neutral colour. <br>  Here's the links to the recommended stores... :)<br>  <a href="http://www.charlotterusse.com/family/index.jsp?cp=2758877&categoryId=2774185&view=all" rel="nofollow">http://www.charlotterusse.com/family/ind...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/category.jsp?_DARGS=/urban/catalog/common/highlited_itemcount.jsp_A&_DAV=true&_dynSessConf=4151184326967688572&itemCount=60&pushId=WOMENS_ACCESSORIES&id=W_ACC_BAGS&selectedProductColor=&navCount=&navAction=poppushpush&sortby=&prepushId=&popId=WOMENS" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/cat...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ae.com/web/browse/category_feature_item.jsp?catId=cat90052" rel="nofollow">http://www.ae.com/web/browse/category_fe...</a><br>  <br>  Hope I helped! :) <br>        -Lyssa|`|g2GogSALaa	Handbags?

11Vo2B2Paa	i hear the pain is pretty good<br>  and if your meaning, if you take them out will they be noticeable--- yes they will. there will be two holes right below your lips!<br>  the only one that you can hide is septum piercings which i hear hurts like crazy bad but it looks super cool|`|ss48BEk5aa	It doesn't really hurt at all, probably a 3 on the pain scale. Gauging the ears hurts way worse. But they are very noticeable. You have to leave them in for at least 6 weeks for them to heal properly. If by some chance your parents don't look at your face for 6 weeks, they would still eventually notice the holes. I had mine done for about 7 months only, and one fell out while I was vacationing in Vegas and it closed up after only 2 hours (by the time I bought a new ring for it, it was too late) I still have scars to this day that are very noticeable. Don't get me wrong, I love these piercings, but if your parents say no, you might as well wait til your 18|`|YGoz8wiZaa	it will be bearable. and there is probably no way in hell they would not notice.|`|y2gBPwUVaa	they will be super noticeable. i just got my septum done last weekend and most people (my parents) still don't know that i even have it done. its so easy to hide amd easy to clean. the only thing is the pain was so intense i thought i was going to pass out, it was the most painful thing that i have ever done and i thought i had a high pain tolerence. it still hurts when things touch it and it somewhat hurts when i push it up into my nose, but if you want a piercing thats easy to hide its perfect. i hope this helps you|`|XaYHMNusaa	The pain is very bearable.  And yes, they'll notice b/c they'd be right on your face.|`|rTCR0FoHaa	if you ice your ears before..it wouldn't hurt as much..<br>  depends where you get them|`|1vecPiRpaa	i had them done and they were seriously painful, especially for like 2 weeks after cuz you're whole bottom lip swells up.<br>  and yes they will notice straight away ! you can't take them out for a couple of months cuz they would heal up almost instantly !<br>  plus retainers don't work on facial piercings like that, you can still see the hole and yeah you can still see the hole when the piercing is out !<br>  bad bad idea i swear to you, please don't get it done unless they are alright with it !! and if you do,,,,i wouldn't get them both at the same time

Preparation H (you can get it at Boots - it smells bad, I've tried it) works on improving the dark circles if they are caused by broken blood vessels (did nothing for me). There are so many theories about what works and what doesn't but there are also so many causes for this common problem, eye creams won't work (I am a beauty therapist and tried all I could get my hands on). My problem is hereditary and I have done a lot of research about this. Lack of sleep will make it worse, but the only thing that works for me is concealer, I am so sorry I can't help you any more than this and that you are not allowed to wear make up.|`|A57Qjaszaa	It is certainly true that some people have this as part of their genetic heritage...<br>  You could try a good eye cream,as these are designed to lift dark circles and bags. Apply with your ring finger, as this is the weakest finger and will do the least damage to the delicate skin around your eye. Use patting motions in a circle around the eye area to increase the blood flow to the area.<br>  It would be best to choose a cream that used natural ingredients, without artificial fragrances or preservatives.<br>  I would recommend using the eye cream from the FC5 range of Arbonne, as you are so young. If you were over 35 and did not have sensitive skin, I would recommend the Re9 eye cream...|`|WuSvIZ1Qaa	I haven't ever tried it, but i heard vitamin C helps with that.

acfd7907edce364d509ad8e43b8f4f0faa	Wearing liquid eyeliner, or any eyeliner, on your eyelid will make your eyes appear bigger. It makes your lash line appear thicker, therefore making your eyes appear bigger and wider. Applying eyeliner to your waterline will make your eyes appear smaller. Instead, apply it below your eye, only going about 1/3rd of the way across. It will give your eyes depth and width. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y2/oNeHUngRybUnnY/For_Posting_and_BlahBlah/?action=view&current=04a.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y2/oNeH...</a>|`|0Kr1VBk0aa	Use white or skin tone eyeliner and rim the inner part of your eyes to make them appear larger.

Consider proper application of eye shadow or possibly fake lashes to make your eyes stand out.
AaXl3vcCaa	its just like super glue
nrTVlo8Eaa	After you sharpen it, take down a little of the sharpness by drawing a line on your hand...I think the very pointy tip is breaking off when you are trying to draw a perfectly straight line on your lids.<br>  <br>  Also, try practicing drawing the line on your lids with different eye products UNDER the line such as moisturizer, dry eye shadow, moist eye shadow [like a lip stick, only eye colors]...try various combinations to see which layers suit you the best. You'll benefit in more that one way in that each time you do it you'll get a little steadier and more effecient.<br>  <br>  Another thing to try is to upgrade to a department store brand of eyeliner such as Lancome or Chanel or similar. Possibly the chemical make up of the eyeliner is what you're having trouble with.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that that well defined line you see on dramatic eyes is probably made with a liquid eyeliner, where as the smudgy smoldery look is made with a crayon liner, and then purposefully smudged with a finger tip or sponge.|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	Liquid is really hard if you don't have a steady hand. If you just want a darker lashes look, try a pencil and line the inside of your lid. Lift up your lid a bit, and then apply (it will tickle) right at the base of your lashes. This is a great day look, and then for night you can darken it up by going on the top of your lashes. <br>  When you do that, do what the girl above said, pull your lid by pulling the outer corner of your eye towards your hairline. This will give you a better look at where you are applying.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klsgXpHzHKI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klsgXpHzH...</a>|`|cpfcRw0Oaa	take the hand ur not using to apply and stretch the skin by holding the outer corner of ur eye when its closed. start with a very thin line and work ur way up to a thicker line.<br>  <br>  mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmCT9OGk2cxJ9CGcyepMYWrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309131327AARoSPq">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Use pencil.

5f0f9b83760938846ff76c4e58b88636aa	Well any volumizing shampoo will work.  Then get out of the shower, and put a volumizing mousse in your hair.  Then if you want, blow dry your hair, but flip your head upside down so like your face is facing  your stomach.  Then your hair will have lots and lots of volume.<br>  <br>  The mousse I use is Brit Style Magnitude Mousse.<br>  <br>  I use John Frieda's line of shampoos/conditioners.<br>  <br>  Works for me!|`|752a09253c730785a794709c07fc1192aa	i just use to different shampoos and conditioners. Try looking for the shampoos and conditioners that have the volume adding stuff you want.|`|7b63f3d20a2f8880965a095f5100f712aa	ummm.....  i dont kno maybe u shood go 2 a professional and ask them (u dont have to * out suck)|`|0efeaecca5bda986d44d8c5bce6bab9eaa	OK. First thing, use less conditioner, a very small amount just to detangle your hair. The next step is a good volume enhancing mousse. Work that all over your damp hair and air dry it. Then take sections of hair, spray some root lifting product at the back of one section at a time near the roots and blow dry. This will give you plenty of volume. For added bulk, you can put some big Velcro rollers on your hair after blow drying, spritz lightly with a hair spray and leave the rollers on for about 20-30 minutes. And always use a round brush for blow drying if you want volume. This sounds pretty elaborate, but it works.|`|7ff7dd79b4344238bc2a1abb5038f8a9aa	tease youe hair gently and use a root lifting enhancer. i would suggest Matrix amplify.|`|82dc098335e3207690f06e3ac8dc9495aa	I am actually a hair stylist and the major trick to big hair is PRODUCT!  Volumizing shampoos and conditioners are a start, but I recommend a product called Guts by Redken.  It's a spray  foam that you apply to the roots of your hair, and then blow dry.   It makes your hair strands feel almost fat, and gives you great volume.  Fluff with your figners and use a light aeresol hair spray.  Heavy spray will cause it to fall flat. If your hair falls flat even after that, be daring and try throw a little backcombing in!  It will help hold your volume all day!|`|9b507711a4ae946a87a875da395575bdaa	i use a root lifter by tigi. with my hair wet i spray that directly on the roots. when i blow it out i make different parts all over my head and blow the root upward. pull the hair upward with a round brush, or set it with rollers and mist them just a little with a light hold spray. that is going to give you the best lift that your hair type will allow. good luck!|`|AA11606799	Put Mousse in your hair as you blow dry it.  Apply a little, dry, apply a little more, dry, etc.  If you only use a little, it will volumize without giving that Pat Benatar 80's look.  Hope this helps!

But you have to absolutely have to wear heels. Now your heels should match your top. Hair is usually worn down, a quick blow dry style is good.

K4lRi1fjaa	G'day Sarah,<br>  <br>  Thanks for your question.<br>  <br>  It is your decision but I wouldn't advise it. It certainly wouldn't be a good idea for anyone hoping to resume a modelling or acting career. For example, it would limit actors to playing bad girls or partners of bad girls. If you must get a tattoo, a small discreet one would be better. <br>  <br>  I'd speak with your partner as well to seek his views.<br>  <br>  Regards|`|b2ZwhOqsaa	i agree that it looks tacky. i do not like tatts at all. on men or women.<br>  <br>  especially if you want to get into acting or modelling.|`|CsIvy5MAaa	It's pretty cliche now. Too many people have them.|`|szYAHqwTaa	I totally love the wings on the back. Its cute and if done right it would look great. If that's what you like then do it. <br>  <br>  Tattoos are only trashy when tasteless.|`|ss48BEk5aa	it was cute on the first person who thought of it. Now it's just trendy.<br>  <br>  You can think of something better!|`|s3FWCRGxaa	I like them if you get it done good sized and with gorgeous detail!! i wouldnt go for color or anything but its your choice.|`|54048f431e23af198481432570ea86bcaa	tacky|`|3m7diCxPaa	Sometimes I find that some angel wing tattoos resemble chicken wings... <br>  <br>  I used to like them, but i've come across them too many times, but i wouldn't call them trashy. Actually, i've come across tattoos in general, too many times.<br>  <br>  It all depends on the person, and how they wear their tattoo <br>  <br>  Get what you like... if it's angel wings, then go for it ;p|`|ntfOcTnWaa	Yeah, the angel wings kind of sound trashy looking, unless you have a nice, detailed drawing that will look good.<br>  <br>  Personally, huge fan of tattoos, however just get an overall beautiful sketch of it and get a talented artist and it'll look beautiful.|`|IKpwMXTlaa	well if you want to get into modeling i wouldnt do it, you wouldnt be hired by many people if you had a huge tattoo on your back. i mean, what kind of clothes can you model without showing them?<br>  <br>  abd i mean i think it could look cool, but think when you are forty? thenit will be trashy. and old and wrinkled it will be verrrrrry unattractive.|`|r9yowD2Iaa	It depends if they would suit you or not. Sometimes they look really cool and then on someone else they just look trashy and don't really suit them. If you do get them get them done at a good place.|`|9RhPrJQYaa	I think if you get angel wings get something different about them.  Unless they are an overdone tattoo. but even if they are an overdone tattoo i still think they look very good on a girl.|`|dCJx9vEVaa	Angel wings wouldnt be nice....thats more for when someone passes away..|`|d9B4EVFxaa	I say if you like it get it!! And as for everyone that is saying don't get it because you want to get back into modeling don't listen!! I have tattoos and am a model!!! I'm an alternitive model (ex. Suicide Girls) so I say do what you want an what makes you happy there are tons of modeling jobs out there for girls with tattoos!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: LOL yes I have modelled for the Suicide Girls but trust me that was only one out of hundreds of jobs I get!!! I have modelled for skateboard co., snowboard co., clothing lines, and just plain alternitive modeling not everyone wants to look at the same old idea over and over!!! I know I get excited when I see a model in a mag. that has piercings and tattoos!!|`|m88tCBIKaa	Trashy. Having wings at all ruins the beauty of humanity.|`|XJhOa3Q5aa	I love my body art. I have 3 tats on my back and have no regrets|`|s0lcBI5baa	I love tattoos on girls, and I am straight. I myself am covered in tattoos, I have my chest, lower back, two on my shoulder, both sides, and working on my sleeve. I do find it harder for guys to accept it, espcially in the smaller city I live in now. As far as the wings, those are over done, but still can be done well. If you are looking to do some modeling and acting, it is extremely frowned upon in  those areas. They perfer natrual beauty rather than tattoos. Yes Angelina has tattoos, but if alot of her movies, they are covered with makeup or clothing. If modeling and acting is what you want to do, please think real hard about getting work done, since it is 10x more costly and painful to get them removed.
l7qjD1QSaa	Yeah it is kinda insulting.<br>  <br>  I used to be really badly hurt by people saying it was ginger, all my life I've been saying it's red & about 2 1/2 years ago, when I entered High School, everyone started calling it ginger & making fun of it, which hurt a lot. It was like being spat on constantly wherever I went for me.<br>  <br>  I've grown used to it now, but it was very hard to adapt to & it did hurt a lot, mostly because I liked to think of it as red, but also because of how it sounds. It just sounds pretty sharp & a bit insulting anyway.|`|AA11461724	i used to dye my hair red. i was never called a ginger but i've heard of it. i knew this naturally red haired girl that said she was called a ginger all the time and she hated it so much she dyed her hair brown. i thought it was dumb, i didn't see why being called a ginger was so insulting. i knew a girl named ginger, so i don't know, it's not as bad as "dumb blonde" ...|`|4d39218667eb8c323bab12b2798e6a3caa	if that person is insecure about themselves it can cause them to dislike their redhair. i personally love redhair.|`|m88tCBIKaa	"Ginger" is just a nickname for redheads|`|HgS1XKEEaa	well im not a redhead but my friend is & she says it doesnt bother her at all.<br>  but then again everyone is different.|`|AA11309717	Like Ginger on Gilligans Island, yes?<br>  <br>  I don't think it's a big deal really

CsIvy5MAaa	Tattoo removal creams are widely available online. But there's no evidence that they work. At best, tattoo removal cream may fade or lighten a tattoo. The tattoo will remain visible, however, and skin irritation and other reactions are possible. Remember, tattoos are meant to be permanent. Because the ink is placed beneath the top layer of skin, complete removal of a tattoo is difficult. If you're interested in tattoo removal, don't attempt it on your own. Ask your dermatologist about laser surgery or other options for tattoo removal.|`|ntfOcTnWaa	I heard there's a cream called like "wrecking bomb/balm" or something to that extent, and I heard it drastically fades tattoos.<br>  <br>  <br>  I could be wrong about the name, but just google something to that extent.

027f718c10034b9410bd7f94684f6da6aa	Give this a try for at least 2-3 weeks to see if things get better.<br>  <br>  This isn't going to be easy but if you're serious about this then it is worth a try. This is going to sound like a diet but it is good food combination. <br>  Cut out <<all>> breads, pasta, cookies, cereals, crackers, chocolate, sweets, icecream, cakes, pizza, all fast food etc...basically anything made from flour & away from processed sugar. "gluten" is an ingeredient in the processed food that doesn't do wonders to our skin. Whether one has a problem or not we really shouldn't be eating much processed food.<br>  If you want a snack like crackers or something...go buy gluten free rice cakes from the health food store. You can add honey as a sweet on them. If you really like chocolate...allow yourself 1 choc bar a week...try to make it dark chocolate. It is better for you.<br>  Now if you want bread...you can buy "gluten free" flour to make your own. It isn't that good so I just stick to rice crackers...<br>  Avoid cold cut meats. No ham, sausages, mortadella, salami, pepperoni, etc...I have done this and has cleared me up totally.<br>  I'm not a teenager anymore but my skin looks terrific. It's all about what you eat.<br>  You have to have good combination for your food. Like if you eat chicken, have it with a big salad or brocolli. Don't have protein with potatoes. That's a bad food combo.<br>  If you want to have potetoes; have potatoes with salad. that's a good food combo.<br>  When we combine the right foods together we will have better looking skin, no weight gain, and many other medical problems will clear up.<br>  I'll give you an example of what to eat okay.?<br>  <br>  breakfast: 1 banana & 1 kiwi or orange or 1 hard boiled egg w/ a rice cracker or two.<br>  1 grapefruit or oranges freshly squeezed<br>  1 glass of milk or grn tea<br>  drink 2-3 glasses of water<br>  (water is very important to drink)<br>  <br>  lunch: grilled chicken or turkey breast some lemon squeezed on it...mmm I like lemon<br>  Romain lettuce salad.<br>  Dressing should be balsamic vinegar or wine vinegar w/ olive oil.<br>  stay away from ketchup, mayo, soy sauce & bbq. sauce<br>  <br>  or you can have stir fried veggies w/ rice...also very good. You can eat rice but not pasta. Rice is really good combo with greens or a salad...no protein.<br>  <br>  snack: walnut halves or raw almonds (unsalted)<br>  fruit<br>  lots of water<br>  cup of grn tea<br>  <br>  dinner: hamburger or fish w/ brocolli or spinach<br>  you can have 1 or 2 rice crackers (or save them before bedtime with some honey)<br>  lots of water<br>  grn tea<br>  <br>  I also used neutrogena soap and their acne cream. For astrigent I used sea breeze. Try not to pop your pimples.

Chin up, take a deep breath & smile.<br>  <br>  The Lord bless you & keep you.|`|RsPXsMYuaa	So i'm 20 and still get spots now but thanks to years of being in your position have found a regime that works for me.<br>  Firstly, accept that your skin isn't always going to be perfect. It's a horrible fact of being a teenager but their's little you can do to control hormones.<br>  Secondly, understand it's not just about what you do with your face. You should be making sure you get exercise, plenty of sleep and a good diet. You may want to take a multivitamin supplement. Perhaps even Evening Primrose oil supplements which are known both to be good for the skin and balancing hormones.<br>  Lastly, you really do need to find a skin regime that suits your skin. Make sure to use a facial scrub. Just once a day in the evening, any more often and you'll only over-stimulate your skin and encourage it to produce more oil which will lead to more spots. Be sure to use an anti-bacterial wash when not using your scrub. Personally i found using cold water to wash my face and never hot to be very important. Too much hot water again only encourages your skin to start reacting and producing more oil. If you do use hot water and want to continue to do so at least make sure you splash cold water across your face after washing to close those pores back up again.<br>  Finally, moisturise!! People with acne do not think they should moisturise but it's probably the single most important thing i do to keep my acne at bay! Use a light, oil-free moisturiser or one designed for acne-prone skin and use it when your skin is dry after every wash. Moisturising ensures your skin maintains a good balance and keeps it looking at it's best<br>  One more thing. Do not use excessive cover-up or other make-up. If you need cover-up then choose a light one and use sparingly.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck and don't let it get to ya!|`|ovPfkHSCaa	If you've tried a variety of different acne treatments to no avail, then you might have come to the conclusion that it's impossible to find a permanent and effective acne cure. While acne is a huge frustration for many people, realize that it is possible to finally eliminate acne once you understand how to use an effective treatment regimen.<br>  <br>  More Info Here:-|`|CDQgNCGAaa	I found that eating fatty or oily foods contributed to the oiliness of the skin and thus caused pimples. What really helped though, was a deep skin cleanser. Ask your pharmacist. Oh, and don't use vaseline or really thick moisturizers. If you use the correct kind of soap, you won't need moisturizers at all|`|yxqMBDLwaa	its definitely your hormones.. you need internal medication.. go to the doctor maybe they can prescribe medicine or refer u to a dermatologist<br>  birth control pills can help most times, but i dont think your mom will let u get this cause ur so young|`|FzTVi22Uaa	Ignore everything anyone says about food. Ask any doctor, read anything about acne, and you'll find that food has nothing to do with it. Acne is mainly the result of hormones that cause the oil glands in your face start producing a lot of oil. That's how accutane works. It shrinks the oil glands in your face so that they stop producing oil, and it's around 75% effective after using it just once. But this is an incredibly radical treatment you should talk to a dermatologist about.<br>  <br>  Definitely go to a dermatologist. He/she might recommend starting you on birth control. You might have religious reasons against this, but if you aren't having sex, then it shouldn't be an issue. It helps to regulate your hormonal balance, plus your period is easier to manage (always a good thing).<br>  <br>  When you wash your face, start hot water running in the tap. Hold your face near it to open your pores--but not so hot that you scorch your face! Opening your pores will allow the cleanser to get in and clean out your pores. Hot water opens them up. Try Neutrogena or Proactive. Wash your face. Then after you've rinsed, splash your face in cold water to close your pores back up again. The proactive system comes with a toner. If you use this, just wipe it on your face with a cotton ball. Then put on the moisturizer.|`|fnFuug77aa	I had the same type of acne when I was your age and tried ProActiv as well. It did work for a while, but seemed to somewhat stop after about a year. I went on birth control which helped regulate my hormones and it worked extremely well. Also, I've been using the same face wash and topical treatment for a long time, and it works really well:<br>  <br>  St.Ives Apricot Scrub: Blemish and Blackhead Control <br>  Clean and Clear Persa-Gel 5: 5% Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Medication<br>  <br>  If you find that the Persa-Gel dries out your skin too much, use a light moisturizer after you apply the gel and let it dry.

If this does not work, i would try cif cleaner, just dont use to much or it will take the colour out of the carpet.<br>  <br>  If neither of these work, you should come clean with your mum and tell her how sorry you are. It may take a while for her to forgive you but at least you will have been honest and hopefully she can respect that.|`|tXSPCtHCaa	I hope you are over 18 and pay rent - if not then you don't need to be telling your mom where she's allowed in her own house!|`|ghAToqu5aa	buy some flash tissues...if you live in the u.k!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and rub rub rub rub! scrub scrub scrub!<br>  <br>  <br>  try hot water toooo

A natural cleanser daily, facial peeling a few times a week, a facial mask a few times a week and a day and night cream.  Please visit my web-store at <a href="https://www.infashionsense.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.infashionsense.com</a> and read more about Vivo Per Lei (White Collection) facial products (composed of minerals from the dead sea).  They are extremely economical in that you only use a tiny amount so they last a very long time.  Please feel free to email or use the live chat on the store should you have questions.  Hoping this is helpful info!
rCR8D00qaa	toothpaste leave it on for about 10 minutes and then wash it off . works great for me but everybody skin is different. hope this helps.|`|b2ZwhOqsaa	ive heard honey works. just put some honey on it and leave it overnight.|`|Z3wg4Z3daa	Cut it out with a rusty spoon|`|lDXh0jRVaa	This is going to sound ridiculous but I promise you I'm not yanking your chain. <br>  Whether or not this is a home remedy kind of depends on if you have it in your house or not :-P<br>  Desitin (the baby rash cream) will make your pimples disappear overnight. You don't need much and it is very cheap if you don't have it on hand but you HAVE to get Desitin or it won't work. Why it works I have no idea but it was a remedy handed down to me from my mom's friend and I couldn't believe how well it worked. And I use all that benozyl peroxide, salacitic acid, and prescriptions!|`|vkIqaFQ1aa	Slap a bit of toothpaste on it,  It does work.|`|UJwb4zuraa	put toothpaste on it,<br>  or freeze a spoon and attach it to it|`|vcpboeNuaa	I use toothpaste to dry them out but you can also make a paste by crushing an aspirin and mix it with a little water and put it on the pimple.  That really works if they haven't turned into a white head yet.  It takes the redness and swelling away.|`|CtKF2XRVaa	Washing your face with cold water, then warm, and alternating a few times can prevent pimples, but for one that is already n your face, putting toothpaste on it overnight for a few nights works just as well as perscription pimple cream.|`|RsPXsMYuaa	eek..you'll have to accept they're only going to get a little worse before better. Toothpaste or any antiseptic is your best bet. Put it on the bad area and leave over night.|`|IMPh53Ssaa	take longer baths and hold your breath under water maybe even use a snorkle, but be careful many people fall asleep and drown while taking long baths|`|vuxef3O4aa	Save the Pits!  answer sound good to me, other wise i would just try to pop them.|`|VrLCho3Raa	Put Elmer's glue on your face. Wait 'till it dries, and pull it off|`|qbPGyAbvaa	try toothpaste, it dries mine up quickly. use paste though not the gel.
PWgScyw5aa	yes|`|m88tCBIKaa	You're worrying too much. You sound proportionate, so go for it!|`|xJCFgEneaa	Of course!  You don't need to be tall and stick-like to pull off skinny jeans-that's a total urban myth.<br>  <br>  I have curves, too-little waist, curvy hips-and I only wear skinny jeans.  They not only fit me well, but accentuate my curves unlike flared jeans.  I especially love them with heels.  They make me feel like my legs are super sexy.<br>  <br>  Black skinny jeans are also more forgiving for curves than light, neon, or acid ones, so good choice there!  Granted that does stop me from wearing all of the above... My whole philosophy is if you feel comfortable in it, go ahead an wear it.|`|7BKv1j69aa	Try here <a href="http://www.discountshollywood.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.discountshollywood.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pempeo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pempeo.com</a><br>  shipping is FREE !!!!

6c4eacbc33273c871bc7185d6f301bc7aa	Do not dye it more than 2 times in one day. The second time you need to be careful, add about a teaspoon of conditioner to the mix. I did this once when a color came out wrong and it helped keep it from getting too damaged.|`|XLJjNmjGaa	why dont you try and see <br>  <br>  <br>  my record is 23|`|bu6BhCnpaa	you can do it as many times as you want...but you will dry out your scalp and basically hurt your hair.  <br>  <br>  its best...if you messed up to do a good shampoo and wait at least 48 hours.<br>  <br>  better is 2 weeks...just to avoid a lot of damage|`|AA11461724	you should really only dye your hair once in a day, but if something happens like it turns out green or something or you miss a bunch of spots it won't harm your hair to do it once more, but no more than that, it will really irritate your scalp. i dyed my hair 4 times in one day once! the last time i rinsed the color out of my hair, i could feel these little blisters on my scalp that would pop when i touched them. it was so gross, and it left little scabs so i couldn't dye my hair again 'till it was healed. good luck!|`|55c6bcdec944656754c033c36667ba6baa	I did mine twice in one day but I'm sure that's not good for your hair. Just try doing it once every couple of weeks.|`|igkeGdFraa	I do it about once every 2 weeks.|`|SzdSa5ftaa	Unless you want to be bald and not really worry about hair color anymore i suggest dyeing them once every month and a half, that stuff is very strong and damages your hair.

hZ9Awgf0aa	You made it the second time(correct way). It's meant to be sticky like that and you have to be quick to put it on the area you want to remove hair from so that it actually sticks and then you slowly push it back.. It hurst like hell I tell yah. I don't think it's worth it. It's really hard to use once you make it and it's so sticky. Just buy already made wax and use that.. seriously.. sugaring is just so messy... :P
