lyhnHhuWaa	I read an article on this the other day.  Right now they're all hurting and are trying to come up with creative ways to make a few extra bucks.  They're being stiffed at a phenomenal rate so their paying clients are being gouged for the difference.  Apparently, changes in spending habits are now used by some companies as an indication of potential risk and increasing the interest rates based on this.  So, if you used to shop at Sacks and Whole foods and are now shopping at Dollar General and Bob's Discount Foods they assume that you're struggling financially and are now a risk.  Some are also comparing your spending habits to others.  If they have a ton of folks shopping at Sacks who stiff them, they'll assume you to be a risk based on the trend.  Many are also lowering credit limits on people.  This has caused problems for many folks who use AMEX for work travel.  It's all in the fine print of the cards everyone signed up for, though.  The best thing for anyone to do is stop using them for the time being.  I don't foresee it getting any better any time soon.

However, the reality of the situation is that, legal or not, father's aren't very likely to get full custody of a child away from the mother unless the mother is deemed incredibly unfit.

You really thought this one out and have some good analysis.  I would say Americans who buy illegal drugs do not care who they hurt or where the money goes.  All drug users care about is getting high and getting there next fix.  Its a sad story but the cost of one users problem is actually lives of those who try to protect innocent people from exploitation and harmful drugs.  The most funny thing is you haven't heard our President speak out against drugs, in his book he is very open to his drug use in college, and has no plans on countering the raising violence that is affecting South Americans.  What is even sadder is the wheat crops would trun a bigger profit then actual cocaine.  Yes wheat and other gains are more profitable the cocaine and marajuinia.  Sure it has a higher street cost, but the growers do not make that much, you have a endless system of drug cartels, weapons smugglers, mercenaries and governmental agencies you are trying to avoid and all that cost money.  When you do a cost benefit of cocaine vs. wheat.  Wheat is cost less and you keep what you earn.  You also retain the ability to reinvest without fear of governments catching on to your operations either.  That means new equipment and better farming equipment.  That will enable many migrant farmers to send there kid to schools and continue to prosper as a community.  But for right now, Americans who support the drug trade care nothing for the lives that are lost, it makes more sense to them for it to be legal so they can continue to destroy lives and themselves.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	you are nuts.|`|Uaci5YXWaa	Truly, Mexico would not be in a "war on drugs" if it were not for US consumers supplying the bad guys with money and the DEA supplying the good guys with weapons.

It is a commodity like anything else, and responds to the laws of supply and demand just like any other commodity.  However because the primary use for money is trade, it moves directly opposite of the rest of the market.<br>  <br>  As governments flooded the markets with money, money fell in value.  This appeared in the form of rising prices, stocks, homes, commodities, all went up, relative to money.  The problem is that real wealth didn't go up, which meant wages didn't go up.  At some point this contradiction collapsed.  <br>  <br>  Now the opposite is happening, the demand for money has risen, and as such prices fell.  As the defaults hit, creditors either decided or were forced to curtail lending, which lowered the supply of money.  The thing kind of fed on itself.<br>  <br>  We wasted a lot of wealth flipping houses and buying huge trucks because they have a hemi.  This thing has to work its way through.  But that is not going to happen in a nice orderly fashion.  <br>  <br>  Instead we are going to watch intelligent and well educated people demonstrate that intelligence and education is no guarantor against doing exceedingly stupid things.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	only good honest people that had a job and then now dont have one and have a house payment those are the ones that should be helped. not the ones that can't make payments cause they are too big and oh my good ness defaulting. that is the stupid peroson so bit off more then he could chew and he knows who he is.|`|ofP7bbX7aa	It started with Carter, To many of the "insiders" made to much money for it to be found out about.

The 'bad mortgage' crisis is only the visible tip of the iceburg, but the real problem is not really a secret. It's just that financial people don't like to talk about it.<br>  <br>  From the Bill Clinton era until quite recently, the USA, and indeed the whole world, experienced strong consumer and financial growth to the benefit of a majority of the world. However, there are two types of growth - healthy growth and cancerous growth.<br>  <br>  Healthy growth is acheived through the mankinds fortitude, invention, and experience. Producing consumer goods more efficiently with new industrial technology, developing methods of food and energy production, improving our service industries and creating lifestyle improvement are all examples of healthy growth, and we are all better for it. Such healthy growth creates financial growth and produces a real improvement in the lot of mankind. Doing things in new ways with invention, and improving efficiency enables goods and services to be provided more cheaply, making more profit for the employers and higher returns for their employees.<br>  <br>  Cancerous growth is imaginary growth. Growth which doesn't really exist other than on account sheets, computer files, or worst of all, peoples imagination.<br>  An example of imaginary growth are the laws of supply and demand which raises prices when supply is short and drops them when supplies are plentiful. Another example is 'profiteering' and financial manipulation which provides goods and services on assumption that value will rise. A third example is warfare - there is potential growth in the building of a country or state, there is potential growth in the provision of weaponry and soldiers to wage war, and there is potential growth in rebuilding the country after the war is over, but at the end of the day all that remains is the same country so all the growth has been imaginary.<br>  <br>  For twelve years most of the world has seen real growth around the 3 to 4% mark, and financial growth around the 6 to 10%. This puts cancerous or imaginary growth at between 3 to 6% each year and this growth, because it wasn't really there at all has to be paid for. We pay for imaginary growth with a recession, or a depression which redresses the balance, and that is exactly the stuff our iceburg is made of - imaginary growth.|`|cfBumVkiaa	The federal reserve chairman is the one everyone should be looking at and blaming, he has more power then anyone, even the president.|`|7MtjF084aa	the government is ALWAYS hiding something|`|oML597wvaa	Its not just bad mortgages or bad lending on behalf of the banks and business's as we are beeing led to believe.

Joe the plumber makes me sick, how dare he complain that he may pay more taxes for makeing 250k a year! screw you Joe! I make 35k a year for a family of four and nobody gives a crap about me. The American people are no longer beeing governed by the people for the people, the fate of our country has now been sealed behind our backs by lobbyists and Monopolies. Thats exactly why very few, if anybody, is beeing held accountable for their part in the fall of our economy. To cut myself short so I don't rant forever, it is a pattern of negligent borrowing, spending, and the people beeing duped by their government for the last 50 years or so. My solution idea; replace every congressman/woman and set a 4 year 2 term limit on their time in their seat, also set 500k limit on their yearly earnings. Then outlaw lobbying for government backing. Punish ALL those who borrow and/or lend negligently be they civilian or government personel. Excuse the spelling errors.|`|w5i5uRAfaa	It's just my opinion, but I think that the desire to 'hyper-consume' along with a cocky attitude is causing this recession.  People don't want to do without in this country.  People don't want to have 'classes' and they use credit to make themselves feel like they are several income levels above their actual income.  People don't save for retirement, college, or tragedy.  <br>  <br>  An example of this is a doctor that I was acquainted with once who, because of his specialty, made $300,000.00 a year; yet he lived paycheck to paycheck.  He said that he and his wife would decide on a Thursday to fly to the Bahamas for the weekend with the whole family, and spent thousands a month on nannies, housekeepers etc.  When he became a quadriplegic in a terrible car accident he and his wife were wiped out financially, had to sell their mansion, take their kids out of private school, move into an apartment, etc.  The wife finally left him and he moved into a nursing home at 35 years old.  Despite the fact that he made a lot of money, he was living like he made over a million a year - way beyond his means.  He is just one example, but millions of Americans do the same thing.<br>  <br>  The housing crisis is not the root cause of the recession, just one of the most noteable.  Of course, I won't let these scam-artist, slimy lenders off the hook, but if the average person who fell for these scams really didn't know any better, what happened to the old addage, "if it seems to good to be true it probably is"?  The sad truth is that if you can't afford it, then you can't afford it, and people don't want to admit this.<br>  <br>  While the housing boom was going on and people were buying houses and lifestyles they couldn't afford with loans that were were a logical nightmare, they were spending on other things as well.  Furniture, cars, stuff - mostly on credit.  And businesses thrived.  New strip malls and shops popped up everywhere and shop-keepers bought billions of dollars of inventory on credit and sold it to people that bought on credit.    <br>  <br>  After the Great Depression, one of the saftey-nets put in place was that each bank had to keep in 'reserve' 3%-10% of the money deposited.  This small percentage is so many billions of dollars across the country that it seems crazy that it would not cover any random amount that people would want to withdraw.  The rest of the deposit is put into a huge pool that is lent out to borrowers to be invested.  This is where your interest comes from.  <br>  <br>  At the same time that the housing boom was going on and all the economic growth was happening and people were borrowing and spending at an unprecidented rate, other people, like bankers and CEO's of large companies were taking advantage of the unregulated environment and skimming off the top (in many ways).  ERON is just one example, and even today, after so many scum bags have been caught, there are still people being caught.  Can you imagine how many people in positions of power are still out there 'skimming' your money, and standard of living?  Don't get me wrong, I am normally for deregulation and not much government interference, but because of this terrible situation we've gotten ourselves into I'm starting to question the sanity.  These big businesses are so involved in the functionality and health of our economy and yet there doesn't seem to be one filter in place to check credentials, honesty, credit scores, etc.  Who hires these guys?  Why isn't there some type of check and balance system?  It's ridiculous (in my opinion).  <br>  <br>  While we are buying all of this stuff on money we are borrowing, our own government is paying trillions on a war and borrowing from other countries to pay for it.  Our citizen dollars are going to other countries to buy stuff, our government dollars are going to other countries to pay debt.  So much of our money leaves this country.<br>  <br>  So now, there is so much debt, billions and billions of dollars of debt, and not much savings.  There is the 3% to 10% in the bank, but pensions have been depleted (people don't know this yet) and the reserve saftey net that people have been saying for decades could never fail is unraveling fast, but people don't know this yet either, (well some do, but it's kind of like Pearl Harbor or the Titanic - they are in denial).  <br>  <br>  Now, suddenly, there is more than the average amount of people that can't pay their bills.  The businesses that were paying their bills with money that was really credit from their overconsuming customers, suddenly can't pay the bills and the small amount of savings that this country was able to accumulate suddenly isn't there and suddenly the 3% to 10% is not enough to cover the debt and banks are starting to go under and a terrible chain reaction has started that can't be stopped.  <br>  <br>  To make matters worse, we don't make anything here anymore.  We import just about everything.  We have very little that we can sell to other countries.  While our citizens are buying stuff th

The Republicans have acted like drunken Democrats with too much spending.  They need to be taken to the woodshed and to get their minds right.  That is true. <br>  <br>  However, your comment about tax cuts for the rich is wrong.  We must realize that you cannot cut taxes on people who do not pay taxes.  We must also realize that the wealthiest 5% pay nearly 75% of the tax bill.  So if you wish to stimulate the economy by cutting taxes you have to cut taxes on everyone who pays them or it will have little stimulus effect. <br>  <br>  Besides, once Obama is done destroying the wealth of the richest taxpayers, who is going to pick up the tab?  If we can no longer collect 75% of the tax from rich people and we certainly cannot get tax money from poor people...Uh-oh!<br>  <br>  *|`|bc2cec2247bb0b16f07f82c5e2ba1ea1aa	Bush left us with about a $490 billion deficit.

Any changes to existing law had to be passed first by Congress. <br>  <br>  His increased defense spending was an excellent idea.  Back then, the main threat to the Free World was the Soviet Union.  By spending money on Defense, (all of which, I might add are good, American jobs) he helped spur the economy, destroyed the Soviet Union and provided many of the weapon systems we still rely on today. Without Reagan's defense spending following the Carter cuts, we would not have been able to bring down the Evil Empire of the Soviet Union or Liberate Kuwait.  God only knows how many other wars and skirmishes were avoided because our enemies feared our might.<br>  <br>  That and his tax cuts which provided much needed money to fuel free enterprise (letting people keep more of their own money) lead to the longest period of sustained economic growth in the History of our Country or any other. <br>  <br>  I'll take another Ronald Reagan, any time.  <br>  <br>  *|`|ofP7bbX7aa	History?|`|f6vLKIFZaa	Modern historians don't think so.|`|2qQPBDlkaa	it scares me to realize this is probably what you were taught in school... we REALLY need to work on our educators|`|HEpBYfWWaa	He fired the union air controllers who refused to return back to work.<br>  He will be remembered as one of the best presidents to hold the office.<br>  I have never heard of him firing FDA officials.|`|651a651e9e9b67965456fb9edd123aafaa	No. Andrew Jackson was the worst ever..<br>  <br>  The worst thing about Reagan, was that his followers bought into his "reaganomics" garbage, and they still want to use it as policy...|`|AA11121510	Obamatard.

The best thing to do is go to the city or county website that you are looking to try and get on with and see what they have as requirements. Or call and ask to speak to a recruiter. That is the best thing to do. Like for example a state's (P.O.S.T) standard maybe no DUI in the past three years but the city you want may say no DUI for 5 years.

9SwjlJtTaa	First of all, I don't believe anyone should complain about issues. I believe that each individual should do as much research as possible on all of the issues and form an opinion. Interpreting what is wrong with a scenario is perfectly fine, that is not complaining. But if you are going to complain about an issue then you should most definitely have a new proposal or opinion on what should be done. <br>  <br>  <br>  In regards to your question, if the potential voter is underaged, then "complaining" is most likely a good thing because they are getting involved in politics. These individuals are most likely to vote in later years, when they are legally allowed to.<br>  <br>  However, if a person is too lazy to vote, or just doesn't want to for some unknown reason then they ABSOLUTELY DO NOT have the right to complain. That is hypocritical in the sense that they exemplify their lack of care for politics yet they try to get involved by complaining?|`|0bbe4c3576db581462d2c070144a1922aa	That would depend. How old are they? If they are 18 and they don't vote, then no they do not have the right to complain. If they are complaining about the policies, they are obviously educated about the issues, so they should voice their opinions. If they are younger than that, then they do have the right to complain because government policy restricts their voice to the vote of their support system (ie parents)|`|ikXRqWxUaa	sure do.  it's no different than people that wants drugs legalized, and when you ask them what are they doing to effect change, they get this blank look in their face and then say some cliche like "it's no worse than cigarettes" or "they could tax it and make millions", etc.  <br>  <br>  bottom line is, if you don't like the laws/government, work for change instead of whining and complaining.|`|vjfdhhSDaa	If you don't vote you don't have any say , keep your mouth shut .

f59ce3e6c69a87e4365442d083f0f2b6aa	Reagan/Bush tax cuts didn't cause budget deficits.  Runaway overspending by Fiscally Irresponsible Lying Spendthrift Liberal Democrats on huge wasteful ineffective social engineering socialist entitlements programs caused, and is causing, budget deficits.<br>  <br>  When we have to spend extra money on truly necessary things like wars to defend the USA, spending on huge wasteful ineffective social engineering socialist entitlements programs should be reduced or eliminated so the deficit doesn't grow so fast, but thanks to Fiscally Irresponsible Lying Spendthrift Liberal Democrats that some brainless IDIOTS keep electing, those money-down-a-rat-hole entitlements programs never decrease.<br>  <br>  So both Bush and Reagan had the right idea, and have good economic records.

Was it due to a decision 2 years ago, or 10 years ago? <br>  <br>  Another problem is measuring how much money is in investment.

Well they may also have thrown it back in. By 1992 the economy was in recession again. there is no point in having short term things that work, only to make it worse in the future. <br>  <br>  Cutting taxes right now would not work, Why? because taxes have already been cut, and cut and cut and that got nobody anywhere. People think they need to save money, not spend it, a tax cut will not help.
iWLeHnlnaa	Your opinion is your opinion, but can you list of those jobs you are talking about? or did you just see a couple posted, and you went hay-wire? Like you said "it's a requirement", if you don't qualify because you refuse to learn another language....MOVE ON! and get over it.<br>  <br>  Being in American gets you a lot of oportunities, and is very important....it's a useful skill. Maybe Americans are just too lazy to learn or are just afraid of foreign languages (Xenoglossophobia).<br>  <br>  Having people in America that don't speak English is a huge benefit, especially to marketing companies. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.strictlyspanish.com/white_paper4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.strictlyspanish.com/white_pap...</a><br>  Virtually every type of company and organization in the United States is being impacted by the growth of the Hispanic population. You see it in government, healthcare, manufacturing, food service, construction, education, finance, legal, and these are just a few examples.  Marketing and selling to the U.S. Hispanics has become so important that universities are offering programs on the subject. Florida State University has recently created a center for Hispanic marketing communications offering graduate certificates and undergraduate minor programs.<br>  <br>  Speaking Spanish in the United States is here to stay and growing. This is obvious to anyone living anywhere in this country. All Americans encounter Spanish-speaking people in their daily lives— whether shopping, going out to a restaurant, at the doctor’s office, or at their place of employment. A study recently released by Hispanic U.S.A., Inc.  called “The Future Use of the Spanish Language in the USA”  says that the number of Spanish-dominant and bilingual Hispanics will increase by 45 percent over the next 20 years.|`|I8M5kw5Saa	exactly and when did you go to these same stores and see the labels written in Japanese,French,German.Etc you don't and the reason is that these people are the real immigrants to America and DO learn the English language ,it says to me that these Spanish speaking people are either too lazy or stupid to learn the language of the land in which they are eating and breeding off of.|`|VOccyg7daa	I agree.|`|LX6AQ4kuaa	I agree with you. I think it is a wonderful thing to be able to speak more than only one language but you can do so at home, not in public where most other people can't understand you. I teach my kid to speak other languages at home (since my first language is not English and I speak 4 languages) but when we go out, we speak English so that people don't get annoyed. I believe everybody should learn English. I don't understand why some overly bold people want to immigrate to a country without any language knowledge and they don't even want to learn the language when they get there. OK, say that they live around their own people but they still have to respect other people that they interact by learning the language of the country where they live.|`|AA11824333	I think it is a shame.

In the moment people start posting lies, they lose all credibility and people find out.<br>   Don't apply for a job that requires a person to be bilingual if you don't qualify. That is the right of the employer and just hating on immigrants is not going to change how people do business. You learn another language or you become unemployed. You can move to another state but your state is not going to change just to accommodate the feelings of angry people.

We kept quiet for 8 years while he was plundering the treasury and instead of taking responsibility for it and face the consequences, what do we do? Blame the poor mexicans who clean tiolets, cut grass, clean the hotel rooms after we check out and other low end jobs. Honestly, how many of the people who ranted here were actually displaced by the a mexican doing a low end job? One guy actually talked about spanish ailes to vent his anger. Unbelievable. Stop blaming others for the bad choices we made in the past 8 years (supporting Bush and watching him do horrible things to this country).
teKeLxX2aa	No. Holiday's are supposed to commemorate enjoyable events or celebrate people who contributed immensely to history. I can't think of any holidays on the American calender, where people get the day off in order to mourn a tragic event.   <br>  <br>  Take Martin Luther King Day, Christmas, and President's Day for example. Even Columbus Day is supposed to represent the day that America was founded (even though it was really only the Caribbeans, and he massacred the natives). <br>  <br>  9/11 will become Pearl Harbor in the distant future. Most people think that you can't forget such a tragic day in history (especially because this one's referred to by the date it happened, probably intentionally). But there are few people who can recollect the time and place where Kennedy got shot, unless of course they lived through that media hysteria afterwords as well. <br>  <br>  We don't have holidays to commemorate Victory in Japan Day, and that day marks the end of the largest and costliest war ever fought in human history.|`|BHBQPFzlaa	No<br>  <br>  We should really treat 9/11 as a terrible tragedy, just like if the planes hit the towers as a result of mechanical problems. I feel like making any more of a big deal out of it is letting Al'Queda win by recording the attack in history as a huge blow struck against the USA. If anything, the week following the attack should have special significance. National search and rescuer day or something.

cACH0uWwaa	Hmmmm, that's funny every public school I have ever been to has offered, Spanish, German, French, just to name a few of the classes that have been offered.<br>  <br>  It is that in this Country most speak English and even though many of us can speak other languages we do not feel like we should take a back seat to those that may speak another language, ie  push 2 for English!  If those that only speak their Countries language come to our Country they should not expect to have everything translated for them.  They should learn our language before they come here.|`|xagIY1Quaa	Because English is OUR language here in the United States of America.  It is what we speak.  If you want to live and work here, then learn it.<br>  <br>  It is the language of the Declaration Of Independence.<br>  The Bill of Rights.<br>  The Constitution.<br>  <br>  English--our language.  Learn it or leave.  It is that simple.|`|b3f4f6798be929d658ec38c5b998d657aa	I do believe that everyone should learn a second language. However, the national language of the United States is ENGLISH. In Germany, all guest residents are required to speak AND write in German. So there is nothing wrong with people learning Spanish, but again if you are coming to the United States you need to be respectful of THIS country enough to learn to speak and write in English.|`|AA11253664	Because the american "culture" is like that. Even in poor hispanic countries, children learn 2 or more languages at school, even when the whole population speaks spanish. usually they learn french as second language. BUT, this country has NO legally established any language, so the opinon that english is the countrys language is false. This is the only country in the world with no language. some states had established spanish/english as theirs states language, the mayority established only english...and when i say "established" im refering to legal terms. take canada for example, their established languages are french and english, almost all of canadians are bilingual, and i think that is a shame to USA. USA is "diverse" regarding with its population, but there is a sector of the population that do not want to diversify, instead, they want the rest of the world to "adopt/assimilate" their culture(???) and values. <br>  <br>  One example: suppose i'm in california (in a very hispanic area), and i'm talking with a cashier (who is hispanic)...I dont feel that i have to speak with her english, if she speaks the same language I do. Do I have to speak english with her so you understand my private conversation with her??? I've seen this opinion against a language only with spanish speakers, i've seen many brazilians, germans, etc, and no one cares...so why the hell you care about spanish?<br>  <br>  Think about this: all the populations opressed by the american people did not assimilate their culture, so why hispanic should assimilate? I'm talking about assimilation, not adaptation. I understand that if they want to live inother country they should adapt to the conditions in the country, but just for the fact of moving to other place no one should change their culture or deny their heritage. Why the hell no one cares about the jewish people living in NY that do not know any english? I have the answer: bcz they are white. <br>  anyway, they will be mayority by 2050! unless americans start making as many babies as hispanics, they will be the ones forced to learn a new language...spanish.|`|A90SRsTxaa	To which tyrannical policies are you referring?

Spanish isn't the only language besides English, therefore, people need to communicate in a langage that is commonly accepted, English.  I speak two European languages and have no desire to communicate in Spanish.  I want my kids to learn English and learn my parents' native tongue, NOT Spanish.|`|CM3Fl3WRaa	It should be in English only! Other countries have had problems with multiple languages spoken. China for instance. People are not able to move from one area to another due to language differences! <br>  My brother- in- law (speaks Cantonese) has to speak to my sister-in-law (speaks Mandarin) in English because of this. <br>  It is also considered rude to not learn the common language of the country you are in. <br>  Also according to yahoo! answers community standards using another language in a section is a violation!|`|GMHERSExaa	The bottom line is our main language is english, if people don't want to speak it, like you then go back to your homeland. This is America we shouldn't have to cater to any other country or its language. I think its about time, Latinos respect the country that offers them opportunity and a better way of life instead of spitting in Americans face. If it keeps going like it is Americans are going to fight back, so watch out!!!!|`|TttP1sENaa	People from every other country learned English - get used to it or go back.<br>  <br>  Immigration did not start in the last 20 years . . . Immigrants have been coming here steadily for the past 400 years.  And they've all learned English.<br>  <br>  I refuse to press 1 for English and I refuse to struggle to communicate with someone in India when I call about my local service.  <br>  <br>  Multi-lingualism is applaudable, but why Spanish?  Why not Chinese or Japanese or French or German?|`|Ut2ouMRKaa	Because it was Americans who learned English who have made this country great We did not run our country into the ground and poverty as you mexican speaking people have then run away from it to go mess up some other country.

Ask yourself this Why should we as a nation change our language for you after 200 years.|`|AA11777563	It should be English only.  Other immigrants learned English or are trying to learn it.

He's not my president, he may be yours, but I do not believe he is going to do anything for the working class, only those on welfare.  He said that he was going to make sure every person who wanted to work would be able to get a  job.  I beg to differ.  Things have only gotten worse since he came into power.

No one will be sent back for another tour to Iraq if they just got back. It simply has not happend. Once you return from Iraq you have to stay a minimum of 6 months before you can deploy again.

Every soldier will be stop lossed for this deployment, unless granted otherwise.<br>  <br>  *EDIT-- To the above poster saying a lawyer can intervene.. Most cases this cannot be done. Why you may ask? Each soldier, no matter what branch signs an 8 year MSO (Military Service Obligation).

a9dd122f6e9e49753e088e4b5d0b3c65aa	First, let your friend's attorney answer their questions for them.  <br>  <br>  Second Burglary is the act of entering or remaining in a building with the intent of committing a crime.  If you steal something while inside you can be charged with theft as well.  Usually there is an inference of intent.  Other words, by breaking into the building, you are inferred to have acted with intent to commit a crime therein.  It is up to the defendant to present evidence the intent was not to commit a crime.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	What's the "misunderstanding?" They were breaking windows for fun?<br>  <br>  Why is it you people come in here with these crimes and always write "it was a misunderstanding?" I'm guessing these hoods have prior records as well. And you're clearly not giving us all the details.<br>  <br>  Hopefully they'll go away for a while.|`|48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	In California, if you are using a tool to get into a building, with the intent to commit a felony or theft, and any portion of the tool enters the building, that is a completed burglary. The theory here would be that the rock was the tool and it entered the building. If this was a residence, the maximum sentence is six years in prison. If it was not a residence the maximum sentence is 3 years in prison or it could be filed as a misdemeanor with a maximum 1 year in jail.<br>  <br>  The defense here would appear to be that they did not intend to commit a felony or theft.  It will be the prosecutor's burden to prove that they did, beyond a reasonable doubt.  Our judicial system does not put the burden on the defendant to prove his innocence.|`|CQTV4ntqaa	Its an attempt burglary because they broke a window. Anytime any part of your body gains entry into the property, that's enough to be charged. Yes, it is a felony and depends on priors to see the outcome. Good luck!|`|cddb16aa82a34a10ef1d3b4255960a9faa	its attampted? they need to prove they had attent to steal stuff..<br>  also if its their 1st time they wont get much time if any, maybe some probation

I think all Americans -- including high income Americans -- did quite well during that decade." The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities pointed out that "what the data do show clearly is that, despite major tax cuts in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006, the economy's performance between 2001 and 2007 was far from stellar." As CAP's Joshua Picker found, the Bush economy "registered the weakest jobs and income growth in the post-war period. Overall monthly job growth was the worst of any cycle since at least February 1945, and household income growth was negative for the first cycle since tracking began in 1967." Women reversed employment gains of previous cycles, and for African-Americans, the worst job growth on record was matched by an unprecedented increase in poverty. Businesses didn't fare any better, as the Bush tax cuts "were actually followed by a pronounced decrease in the fraction of G.D.P. devoted to business investment." Business investment fell after both the Reagan and Bush tax cuts, but rose after the Clinton tax increase, according to work by Princeton professor Uwe Reinhardt."|`|XxUByikJaa	Under Republican Bush the every day working class people saw a lot of taxes come out of their pay checks compared to what big Corporations paid percentage wise .<br>  But if Obama starts acting like a Republican when it comes to over  taxing the working class people then I doubt Democrats will re -elect him. <br>  And that certainly does not mean that we would vote for a Republican instead.|`|zoMK7pypaa	Your LIGHT just went on! TOO LATE!<br>  <br>  They want to tax you for every mile you drive in your own car. We pay taxes on every gallon of fuel that goes into our vehicles. Once is obviously not enough for this administration. <br>  <br>  This in essence, is like going into a restaurant, paying taxes for your meal, AND paying another tax because you ate your meal! <br>  Thanks Obamamaniacs! <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm1KOBMg1Y8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm1KOBMg1...</a><br>  <br>  CELEBRATE doesn't pay attention to this stuff, it's not important to her!|`|xkcLOfTKaa	It is not a cut in income taxes. That increase comes from paying less into Social Security and Medicare (payroll tax) - but the trick is, you only pay half that anyway... You employer pays the other half... and once they get stuck with the bill, watch unemployment go UP and earnings go DOWN!|`|IuJjYz6gaa	You are wrong, the tax code is actually getting changed.|`|ffRTnoEyaa	After inflation because of his spending, you will be losing money.|`|IasHMWM2aa	Yes, that is what a tax cut is. When Bush gave me my tax cut, I paid less taxes. You probably didn't get that tax cut.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	Only if they used the work cut which they most likely didn't. I don't know the details cause this stuff is not what is the most important thing to me with people at war, etc. I trust our gov. & would never say the are dishonest unless I knew that for sure. If the money is meant to help people who are struggling & it is under the name of stimulus it is so you can put some gas in your car now rather than charge it & pay 12% (this is an example).

You will probably be violated on the probation charge as well.  <br>  <br>  Something to think about.  When you invite people to your house, underage or not, to drink alcohol, you take on a huge liability.  If one of your friends slips in the bathroom or falls down the stairs or some other drunk thing and gets hurt, your parents can loose everything they have.  In today's litigious society I have seen several lawsuits of this nature.  I have seen parents loose their homes, cars and savings because their little POS child had a party at their home.  Or better yet, one of your friends gets tanked up, jumps in his little to fast, to furious wanna be car and kills himself or someone else on the way to Taco Bell for food.  <br>  <br>  Bottom line.  If anyone is seriously hurt or killed from getting alcohol from your house at your party, you will be prosecuted as an adult and probably end up in jail.  Your parents will pay the financial price as well.
07TvvktDaa	One of the most brilliant and charismatic of all military generals (called Field Marshall in the German military). He was equally held in high respect by both of his men and by his adversaries (that included Patton, Montgomery, and Alexander). He commanded the German Afrika Corps in North Africa, where he led and won battles from Libya to Egypt. Later, he was assigned by Hitler to oversee the construction of the Atlantic Wall to protect the coasts of France from any Allied invasion from the sea (English Channel). He was responsible for the construction of the blunt and pointed metal barricades that stretched the beaches of Normandy, which later made it difficult for the Allied forces to establish a beachead during the D-Day invasion in June 1944. In the middle of 1944, he was suspected by the Nazis to have been a member of a military group within the German military who conspired in the planning of the bomb plot to assasinate Adolf Hitler in July 1944 (which failed, as Hitler miraculously survived the explosion with minor scratches). In retribution, Hitler gave him the choice of dying either as a traitor or a hero. He could be tried in a military court-martial and be handed the death penalty if found guilty (and be stripped of his military rank and medals, his family not getting any pension and benefits from his death, etc.). Or he could die as a hero by committing suicide (Hitler assured him of a funeral with full military honors, full pension and benefits for his family, etc.), and the Nazi- controlled media will then publish the news that Rommel died of wounds in battle. Rommel chose the second. He was then given a cyanide capsule which he took.|`|IdtzdpqGaa	yes, but you would need some better questions. there is a lot of information on him to just ask can someone tell me about him|`|zWU2skZTaa	Erwin Rommel was a German Field Marshal during the Second World War. He fought in both wars, but only rose to prominence leading the German Afrika Corps in North Africa. He was both feared and respected by British Commonwealth troops for his brilliant leadership. After the Germans lost in Africa, he was posted to France where he led the construction of the Atlantic Wall. Although he was German, he was respected by the Allied High Command post-war because he was involved in the failed conspiracy to assasinate Hitler in the July 20 plot.|`|lrVSk62yaa	Field marshal for the German Army during WWII. Also known as the Desert Fox because he was the lead guy over in North Africa.  He was also in charge of the Normady coast line when we invaded on June 6,1944.  He was at a weding when it happened so he couldn't conduct any opporations.  Then Hitler convinced him to commit suicide after the invation because he wasn't there and that is why they got though.

Bush borrowed too much, spent too much, inflated too much. And when the economy got bad tried to stimulate the economy by giving everyone $600, also Bush would not let failed companies fail.<br>  <br>  Of course Obama is doing the same things as Bush, except just BIGGER. If Obama want real change shouldn't he do the opposite of Bush, like borrowing less, spending less, inflating less, let companies fail?<br>  <br>  Obama is going to make this depression into an economic collapse.|`|0234a5919425f2503a2245af18fde971aa	Eventually, yes, things will be better...BUT remember that 9/11 happened and messed up our economy and then greedy bankers and investment people messed up our economy, and poor trade deals didn't help, and THEN blame George Bush for his 8 years of horrible leadership on the economy....8 years....it will take literally years for this thing to turn around completely, quite possibly longer than Obama's potential two terms (his 8 years if he can get reelected).  Remember that it took World War II to get us out of the Great Depression. Obama cannot do it in a couple months or even a couple years. This is deep rooted and long term with the security and survival of our nation at stake, and that is no exaggeration.  There are economic events that are in motion heading downward that no one and no amount of money can stop, they just have to run their courses...but Obama is setting things in the right direction at least, and that is all he can do...after all he is only the President, and only able to legally and practically do so much.  I swear, if he could, he would wave a magic wand and make it all better, but seriously that is just not possible. While this economic great recession is in progress, we will not have a real perspective on what happened and how we got out of it until a good twenty years or so after it is all over.|`|Yb8IYQJPaa	I am an independent that voted for George.

He is leaving the troops in Iraq and increasing the troops in Afghanistan. Barry criticized George for spending so much on the wars and he is spending even more.

Then we get another totalitarian republican regime because the average American voter is too stupid to see what has happened.<br>  <br>  I wonder what the immigration policy in New Zealand is like.|`|89e0c1de65541f968ea18e0756f6ee60aa	Not exactly.

Oh wait they got rich-er.<br>  <br>  1 term Senator Obama doesn't have the knowledge or experience to solve this problem.

What comes around goes around. <br>  <br>    The crazy thing is people wanted mandatory Spanish tought in schools, when we really need Chinese. Dropped the ball again America.<br>  <br>    RANT- Isn't it funny how the rich and powerful sell average Americans on ideas like everybody should be equal, the lazy people need to be taken care of to, any one who wishes to come here should be able to and get anything they need for free. Guess what? You idiots bought it hook line and sinker. All the fake liberals want to do is lower the standard of living for you with cheap foreign labor so you will just have to fall in line or starve. They aren't losing anything $2Billion is a small sacrifice to pay to keep $10Billion remember you have to spend money to make money. Thats why the Gov. isn't giving the people the bailout $$ they give it to the banks to loan in order to keep people in debt. Lets face it if the Gov. gave the people the $$ at this point in time we would pay off our bills and thats what people are doing now with every penny they can get their grubby paws on. does anyone think the American people have learned their free Gov. accounting lesson yet? if you don't have it DON'T SPEND IT. <br>    This is what I see happening in the next three years- The Gov. will start taking peoples rights away and forcing them to work at lower pay (to help the economy by saving corporations $$) People will start to revolt, martial law will slowly be administered (for your safety) and so on and so on = the slavery of the american people to the rich powerful elite.

For dental work again one of the premier dental schools provided instructors and students. The patient ratio was in the patients favor, however here in the Tampa the situation is much different.  being overwhelmed in the winter with snow birds, the staff is out straight.  Many times the initial care will be done at a private civilian hospital and then followed up upon stabilization at the VA Medical center.

This is totally out of whack, and must fall to around 45-50% of GDP. What this means is that GDP must fall at least 30% from its peak. We've got about another 3 to 5 quarters before growth will resume - though when it does, it will be at a much more rapid pace than we're accustomed to for a while. However, the reality is that most of the recovery will not be driven by consumption, but by private investment and government spending. Look for advanced machine-tooled capital goods like wind turbines, heavy equipment, and anything related to agriculture to lead the way. That's a "realistically optimistic" scenario. <br>  <br>  If you're actually asking about the stock market, the bottom in the DJIA should come in around the 3000-4000 range, though the markets could well over-do things, in which case we'd see a decline to as low as 2000.|`|5bYpbodUaa	When we all lose our homes, or medical insurance, or jobs etc. And we're on our way in doing just that.

Unfortunately, there's a lot of Republicans out there that think the same way, or at least let Rush think for them.<br>      Sarah would support anyone that could help get her elected, whether it be Gandhi, Rush, or Hitler.<br>       Anyone that opposes possible treatments for diseases and disorders as serious as the one that Michael J. has, and makes light of that problem, either has a serious disease of their own, or is an idiot.<br>        I'm no doctor, but Limbaugh is a candidate for both.|`|89e0c1de65541f968ea18e0756f6ee60aa	He wasnt making fun of Michael J. Fox.  He was absolutely right about all that.  Fox had intentionally altered his medication to exacerbate the symptoms of his disease just for effect.  He later admitted this.<br>  <br>  Fox put himself out there on that issue.  He inserted himself into the debate.  <br>  <br>  Is his disease an immunity from criticism?<br>  <br>  Furthermore Fox is wrong on the issue:<br>  1) Bush was against PUBLIC FUNDING of research involving embryonic stem cells. <br>  <br>  2) Privately funded research was not affected.<br>  <br>  3) Adult stem cells had shown a lot of progress.  Despite much effort, embryonic stem cells have yet to show progress.|`|Jq5WK8caaa	Actually Rush was making fun of Micheal J Fox for thinking he had Parkinson disease when he really was over medicated.  Rush was quick to point that out, but Micheal Jay Fox was still on his soap box before you know he started seeing a second doctor and found out he was being over medicated for his condition that made him shake in such manners.|`|dseGQ1Jlaa	the comment was about fox purposely not taking his medication to seem helpless on national t.v.  he was spot on in calling him out on it.

Fox for exploiting his disease for political purposes.<br>  Fox had intentionally stopped taking his medication to induce tremors so that he could make a tear-jerking commercial bashing George Bush.<br>  Fox's actions were reprehensible and he deserved to be criticized.<br>  <br>  We should all find what Fox did to be dishonest and dishonorable, even if we are sympathetic to his suffering from Parkinson's.<br>  Sarah Palin is an honest politician and understands that it is wrong to abuse the public trust as Michael J. Fox did.
UvzKiis0aa	No, we wouldn't.  It has happened before during an economic downturn, many leave and the problem is lessened if not eradicated.<br>  This is why the USA should go after the businesses that hire them.|`|r6JskEtxaa	Or they should remove minimum wage|`|nNuLi83daa	Illegal immigrants like to spread the myth that they do the jobs that Americans do not want to do.

ZOXoPgJbaa	free market capitalism? When have you experienced free market capitalism? You couldnt have if you werent born before 1913 because the federal reserve is an idea straight out of the communist manifesto. It has nothing to do with a free market.

Can you explain what is so free market about that?<br>  <br>  9/11 truthers? Answer me this and I will concede that 9/11 was not an inside job. How did bill cooper predict 9/11 months before it happened, and why was he killed 2 months after it happened? And also tell me why there was so much short selling of American Airlines stock in the days prior to 9/11? Dont ignore me either. Give me some answers. If youre willing to call my grasp tenuous, give me some facts like ive just given you.<br>  <br>  Cambodian national bank is a central bank too. You dont understand. The lifeblood of an economy is money. You cant have fiat money monopolized and call it a free market. What dont you get about that? And also cambodia is a monarchy.

RTx1D48paa	FIRST...... there have been several scientific studies that have STRONGLY indicated that many homosexuals are born that way. They have no more control over their sexual preference than they do the color of their skin......in fact less.<br>  <br>  SECOND ....The British military.....along with many other nations have opened the military service to homosexuals and have NOT had the social / military chaos everyone has predicted<br>  <br>  Third..... As pointed out before there are many homosexual serving on active duty at this very moment.... after 30 years in the Army I have met several that were quietly proudly and professionally serving their country.....one was the pastry cook for General Eisenhower.....he served from WW II to 1962 in Korea when he was "discovered" and forced to leave the service. I know of one Green Beret CSM who is homosexual (????) ...... and he does not skip around post holding hands<br>  <br>  Fourth.....Homosexuals have served in the military with distinction for thousands of years....the Greek "Sacred Band".... it was common for Roman legions to be composed of homosexual couples.....the greatest troop commander in history....Alexander the Great.....had a male lover<br>  <br>  FINALLY..... Those of you disgusted and angry about the private life of others ought to do a little research on WHY..... many psychiatrists maintain your anger is NOT at the homosexual......but at yourself.....you have likely repressed the same homosexual feelings and are guilty about them.... <br>  The American attitude toward homosexuality is archaine......grossly old fashioned..... much of it is based on religious beliefs...... and many Bible scholars are questioning the accuracy of those beliefs......  if homosexuality is genetic as some suspect.....the current policies are totally unfair / unjust<br>  <br>  ( ......and no.....I am not a homosexual..... just a man who bothers to research before he takes a stand on a subject)|`|spuz7DvNaa	It's a good policy. Why do homosexuals think they need to advertise their sexual perversions? They constantlyy say "stay out of my bedroom" and then advertise their bedroom to the public. <br>  <br>  If homosexuals are open in the military many people will not join and I believe if some homosexuals is pushing their abnormal sexuality in someones's face (they all love to do that) some soldier may not have their back.<br>  <br>  Just like in the schools the more rights give to homosexuals to flaunt their abnormal behavior the more they demand (like pushing for the same rights for the truely degenerate transvestites). That would be the next step in the miitary if they do away with the "don't ask don't tell"|`|sUAaeqlHaa	Don't ask don't tell works. I don't care what people in the media say - how many of them served?<br>  DADT works like this... keep your sexual exploits out of the workplace. Simple, right?|`|AA11720887	They should change it from "don't tell" to "don't matter".|`|LcAiHBsaaa	Just as the others have said (great answers by the way guys... except one... ugh) it's best the way it is.  It works, so why try and fix somethin' that ain't broke, right?<br>  <br>  I think you have some great questions here too... something for people who want the policy overturned to think about for sure.<br>  <br>  I'm not against homosexuality at all!  Do what you want, right?  But can you imagine two men in uniform skipping around base, holding hands?  Weird... hahaha|`|OeiKVnMDaa	There are many people in the military today that are homosexual and 90% of the time everyone knows they are...as long as they arent making a big production of it and hitting on everyone not many people care...so as long as there isnt an EO(equal opportunities) violation nothing is generally done anyway...so really it doesnt matter if we have the dont ask dont tell|`|65Q8oMvUaa	I'm not one to judge but I am against homosexuality. I won't go out of my way to point them out and harass them but I also won't go and try to make them my friends. I would rather it stay the way it is rather than be an open policy, but we all know that there are already gays in the Armed Services.|`|AA10626566	Most of them do not have to tell anyway - it is obvious - I think the problem starts when people think they have to announce it like everyone else cares.|`|W3NY2E5daa	I think it all depends on how they integrate them within the military. If a homosexual male joins the military do you put him in the female barracks, the male barracks, or a barracks just for homosexual males? And if you do put the homosexual males in with the rest of the males will they be allowed to have other males visit them in their rooms? If straight guys can't have females in their rooms why should homosexual males be allowed to have males in their rooms? <br>  <br>  I went in the military back in 1988 and was active duty when Clinton enacted the don't ask, don't tell policy. Most people I worked with didn't like it because you didn't know who else was in the showers with you. I have nothing against people that have a different sexual preference then I do but if there are going to be gays in the barracks with me I would rather know who they are so I know when not to take a shower. Otherwise it would be the same as taking a shower in front of a female. If they are going to do that why bother with separate showers for males and females? They might as well make the showers open to both males and females together. <br>  <br>  As far as tolerance I don't think there is hatred for them for their homosexual preference. Every person I talked to about this while I was in the military was against the don't ask, don't tell policy due to the way military members live in barracks. They had no problem working with them, it was just not knowing wether the guy in the bunk next to you was looking at you with sexual thoughts going through their heads. If they are going to let them in they will need to make changes to how they are barracked.<br>  <br>  Added: After I posted the above reponse one other issue came to mind - security clearances. I had a TS/SBI clearance when I was in and the military was real picky about my background due to it. With the don't ask, don't tell policy there is the potential for a security risk if a homosexual male gets a security clearance. If someone else finds out they are gay they can use that info against them to force them to hand over classified documents. So from a national security standpoint doing away with don't ask, don't tell and letting homosexuals be open about it would be better.|`|WgIZUcYfaa	I agree with it. If people openly said they were gay in the military I bet there would be a lot more sexual harrassment and hate crime cases. Simply because people are retarded.<br>  <br>  Plus, who cares if you're gay? You don't need the people you work with to know that you're gay in order for you to do a good job. If you are comfortable enough with a person and you trust them, sure tell them, but why would everybody NEED to know?<br>  <br>  Even if by some miracle it does get overturned, I think the more intelligent people who are gay will still not say anything to protect themselves. This world has been through a lot of changes but there are still a lot of backwards thinking people.|`|AA11586960	Dint ask don't tell is an abomination people have the right to know who they serve With spent 38 years of my life in defense of my and others countries and only to find i was discriminated by my government<br>  <br>  I saw a friend in the late 70 ties die of AIDS and i have the right to protect myself from this kind of Risk don't ask don't tell denys me this right  <br>  <br>  <br>  I don't care who you are and what your preferences are Just Be Honest<br>  <br>  I am

Yes, many of us men are angry that we are losing our jobs.  But it's not like these same jobs  are being re-filled with female workers.  The jobs men are losing are full time, industrial, manufacturing positions requiring skilled labor.  These are unfortunately lost when companies scale back production.  It just so happens that these fields are dominated by men, although some women also work these jobs, and are also subject to losing them.<br>  <br>  By contrast, most of the women that have not lost their jobs, are working office/clerical positions.  Even if a company scales back production on the line, they still need the secretaries at their desks until the company is ultimately shut down.  Sorry to say, the men losing their jobs is an indication that your job may not be far behind!|`|GMHERSExaa	No not really. I am glad woman have gotten special treatment to get where they are and have equal pay even though they cannot perform some jobs as good as a man. I also love the fact that woman now die younger, they use to live 10 years longer than men on average and now there down to just 4 or 5. I am also happy for woman that work hard and put there children in day care, and sacrifice there family for a job, I think its great!! don't you?  Our society is so much better now don't you think? and You should be also proud of the wages being depressed because with woman in the work place it doubled the work force, so now both parents have to work when before just our father could do it and still live better than couples now.

C7wjR42Daa	Deployments on carriers that launch and recover with catapults are not a common thing in the USMC. They do happen but not as often as some think. For these carriers you would have to be involved with the FA18 jet or the Prowler jet.<br>  <br>  The other carriers don't have catapults. Those carry Marine MEU's and in a MEU you will find many MOS's from infantry, to tanks, to AAV, to admin, to armorers, to helo crew and mechanics. These ships basically carry small USMC's on them.<br>  <br>  Any aviation MOS that deals with the CH46, CH 53, OSPREY, Cobra, and Harrier jet will get you on a carrier with the MEU's. These ships have no FA18's on them and the other carriers do not have these aircraft on them.|`|rx7e4Jogaa	You can be in the Marine Security Group, or  you can be infantry, but with the war, being infantry and getting on a carrier is an iffy proposition.|`|SeqRrVmIaa	Most carriers will have a Marine Squadron aboard. At one time you could join the Marines with a guarantee that you would get an air wing MOS. If this is still available it would be the best thing to do to get aboard a carrier. Any MOS repairing aircraft could result in a carrier deployment, mechanic, metalsmith, hydraulicsman, avioncs, etc.<br>  <br>  You should be aware that Marine Corps aviation might land you in a helicopter squadron. You could still be aboard what one might call a carrier but they have different purposes. There are several smaller vessels with helo and Harrier squadrons aboard. The good thing about being assgined to helos is you have a chance to fly. Mechanics are crew chiefs and man a door gun on helicopters. Other machine guns on a helicopter may be manned by a hydraulicsman, electrician, electronics technician, etc. It is exciting duty and you will be likely to see some combat.<br>  <br>  The most important thing to remember is to volunteer. I'm serious. You may have heard that volunteering is bad. It isn't. It often provides some of the best duty. If you get an MOS that would allow you to be on a cruise at sea you may have to ASK for it. If you are well-respected and do your job well your superiors will help you get what you want. I asked to be put on air crew and got it and asked to be transferred to an operational squadron so I could fly more and got it along with a combat assignment. If you want something, work for it and let someone know what you want.|`|fsjIeVpRaa	Everybody gave good answers, but they forgot sigintel, admin, legal, and other organic support to the Marine Aircraft Wing.|`|RDdSOqdnaa	you can be an F-18 mechanic, ordinance, flight equipment.

AA11963685	I have to say, it's mighty depressing.  I've known for many years now that the right wing is less than cognizant of how Bush crapped on the Constitution.  What they don't want to see, they easily ignore.  But even knowing that doesn't stop my disgust from climbing even further when I see them spew this garbage for no real reason other than their petty hatreds.  What kind of American wants their President to fail?  I came to detest George Bush, but I never wished for him to fail. That was like wishing for my country to fail.  They have become teeth gnashing prophets of doom that just can't deal with the fact that this country rejected their way of doing things and thinks we need to let the Democrats drive for while and see what they can do.  Repairing all the damage that Bush has caused this country and around the world will take up most of Obama's time.  We can't expect them to acknowledge that.  That's like expecting Rush Limbaugh to become a human being.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  LOL William - Damn Skippy indeed!|`|TttP1sENaa	Obama and the liberals want to blatantly defy the constitution (the right to bear arms, term limits, etc).<br>  <br>  Bush did not hold detainess, the justice department did.  Just a reminder, the branches of government are separate.  Another reminder, Obama was denied his first attempt to release prisoners because the judge has authority, not Obama.<br>  <br>  Continuing to blame Bush for the acts of multiple branches of government is ignorant at best, especially when the acts are not clearly defined constitutional rights and subject to interpretation.  Some things are NOT subject to interpretation.  For example, I have the right to own a gun as a US citizen - no one can take that right from me.|`|ai4lrclMaa	Amused at their level of frustration and fury that a man of mixed racial ancestry has dared to aspire to the highest office in your country...and actually WON it!!<br>  <br>  Ignore them. they are crying "We was robbed" because it is all that is left to them.

2dqQQg41aa	Anytime it says "comprehensive" it really means amnesty.  The last time a bill like this was pushed it faced the biggest grass roots public outcry the capital has ever seen.  The capital hill switchboard was overloaded and shut down from the swamp of upset citizens who called to complain.<br>  <br>  So it will never pass without a huge battle and any politician who signs it will face re-election death - and they all know it.<br>  <br>  The reforms are meaningless since it would grant amnesty first.  They tried to make it sound like enforcement was first but that was all smoke and mirrors since it would allow all illegals to stay until they could get legalized (no matter how long it took).  It also allowed admitted gang member to stay, convicted criminals to stay and all 12-20 million would have also been allowed to bring family members up here.<br>  <br>  Can you say another "NEW" 100 million citizens who all would qualify for food stamps, housing, welfare, unemployment, WIC checks, SSI, etc, etc.<br>  <br>  SCARY!|`|xagIY1Quaa	DEPORT Deport deport is reform enough for me.

The basic technology of the automatic rifle has not changed substantially in over 50 years.  There is nothing really "new" out there at all.<br>  <br>  *****EDIT****<br>  <br>  So you think bullpups are "21st century"?  You do know that the British army nearly adopted a bullpup design in the early 1950's don't you?  And the Austrian army has had a bullpup since the 1970's.  This is not a new design philosophy.  Just having the magazine at the wrong end of the gun does not make a gun modern.  There have been and still are many reasons to reject the bullpup concept and many armies do reject it.|`|rx7e4Jogaa	It will be many years before the military can field a new service weapon, due to the procurement process, it makes it almost impossible to field a new weapon, especially one that will completely eliminate another.

It will probably be another 20 years before another weapon is even thought of.|`|fsjIeVpRaa	Way the economy is heading...probably rocks!<br>  <br>  Who knows.

Then we'll have a very deadly automatic rifle in our arsenal.|`|65Q8oMvUaa	Who knows. We will find out when the gun is created, until then we will stick with the M16.

146MzXiTaa	yeah.  the fed is a private instution with monopoly on money production.  whenever the gov't needs cash the fed prints it up and loans it on interest.  but, since the fed is the only one that prints money, the interest was never physically printed, so can never be fully paid.<br>  <br>  so, the government is essentially in the chairman's pocket, because he calls the shots at the fed.<br>  <br>  i'm pretty sure the bill to create the fed was drawn up by bankers, not politicians or lawyers, and pushed through congress on a day when most members weren't in attendance.<br>  <br>  in the mid 1900s the fed released a booklet on money production in the US.  it basically described how the business of money works.  its buried in there somewhere that bankruptcies and foreclosures are figured into the system.  with an economy based on credit, someone is going to have to eventually get squeezed to pay up.

They will probably DQ him there but don't be to worried. Because if the exam goes well and the doctor doesn't see and physical limitations with his knee then he will be good to go. But if is his DQ then his paper work will go to the Sergon General to get reviewed. This could be a long process. But it is worth it in the end. I had to wait 3 months for my waiver to clear. And today I just finished my last day at MEPS and I am now in the DEP for the Air Force. If he does get DQ there is always something his recruiter and his doctor can do to get him cleared. Don't take no as an answer. If the Air Force is what he wants don't settle for less.|`|wufKLi6Haa	I had 3 screws in my knee when I enlisted in the AF 4 years ago. When at MEPS, he will talk to a doctor. If the doctor does not think it will hinder him in anyway, he should be fine to get in. If I can do it with 3 screws, a pin shouldn't be a problem.|`|1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	I'm retired Air Force and it will depend on his physical ability to use that knee and his medical history & Dr. reports. If it has healed well and he has no problems or pain with it, then he should be fine.
p1bpXfb5aa	>>Yeah, if you can live on less than 20 grand a year.|`|WgIZUcYfaa	It really all depends on how you are with money, how much your bills are, etc. For instance, my husband (who is in the army) is horrible with money. He is also very stubborn. We also have quite a few bills. I'm pregnant with our first child and I'm not able to work anymore. So when I stopped working it really hurt us. We are barely able to make it every month because of this.<br>  <br>  I like things to be organized, especially when it comes to money. I try to make a budget for us but we can never stick to them due to his spending habits. We live off base and because of that we make an extra $300 per month. Which helps when paying things like cable, internet, electricity, and phone. When you move to ON base housing it ISN'T free. They take all of your BAH money. They also pay electricity, water, and garbage. You have to pay for cable, internet, phone, etc. So you have to see which is better for you, living on or off base, when you find out where you are going to be stationed. My husband is deploying soon and although I am going to miss him like crazy I'm also excited because this will give us a chance to get on top of our bills. He will be able to get the car he wants and I'll be able to look at our bank account without feeling anxious for our child.<br>  <br>  It is very possible to be a stay at home mommy as long as you stay on top of your budget. You have to be disciplined though. He will most likely be an E2 or E3. I'll give you a link to the pay grade chart as well as a link to BAH pay rate so you can see if you can afford it when that time comes. Good luck and God bless!|`|j0gtbpS1aa	If you can get base housing you should be able to swing that.  But the list is usually long. You wil have free medical and dental though.  And if you have to live off base he will get an allowance in addition to his base pay for that.|`|UoAZLRG8aa	Here are some sites that are for military spouses. Keeps these handy.|`|0TUxsbXzaa	you guys will be just fine. they provide you a house to live in or extra money to rent with off base. so the money he makes is just for whatever.|`|g6MiGWuJaa	they have free housing at military bases and lots of benifits I know several moms that stay home.|`|r1zjX6PAaa	Yes if he spends his money wisely you won't have to work.|`|4QddVQ55aa	Well I didn't work the first 7 years my husband was in the military and we were raising two boys while doing that. You can make it if you budget right.  It would be a whole lot easier if you guys don't have an expensive car payment and stuff like alot of credit card debt.  If so, I would get some of that paid off before you quit your job.  Your cost of living will be much less when he joins the military, especially if you leave Hawaii.|`|Jmi1rZeEaa	my husband got out of tech school in october and we got stationed at eglin in florida. i dont have a job and we dont go without, but we definitely dont have a lot of money to just spend as we wish. the plus though is, free housing. he also gets extra income for being married as well as extra income for having a child. its pretty much just up to what you guys want your standards of living to be like|`|3HnVK3eeaa	yes it is possible, he will recieve housing (bah) and BAS (though that isnt much). it is a steady income, however it really depends on your bills, etc. a lot of military wives get small part time jobs working on post/base. they typically have spouse preference|`|IgOGsKpCaa	I was a stay at home mom  of 1 to an Airman.  We always had to borrow money from my mom to have food on the table and sometimes for bills.<br>  <br>  They only get like 700 something every 2 weeks.  We lived in base housing so we had no rent or electricity bills, etc.  Still.  It sucked!|`|7ebNTScOaa	I don't work and my husband is in the military.  You should be able to make if you live on base or off.  We did. As long as you don't go shopping everyday you should be fine.|`|6xoTZYpZaa	Somebody once said, "If you find yourself walking through hell, just keep on walking."<br>  <br>  You'll do just fine, and your child will be just fine.|`|nBjQQ3yraa	It was for us, but I'm happier working!|`|2MII9HuKaa	it is very much so possible but you must take into account you will be living a poor lifestyle unless your spouse can reach a high paying rank, but you should be able to live in military housing off of his one income i think they price it so it is doable... i grew up on a military base with one income and we did fine until my mother became a nurse and added a second income to our family we went from a very small military duplex to a 500,000 house when my father retired from 412 squad|`|9h9JufgWaa	i have fiance who currently undergoing training in the airforce as officer,he's first three months there made me feel sick and alone, i dont have any communication with him, even thru text messaging. they have monthly not so big salary to support a family, but its not on their hands until they finish the first course of the training. I think it will be hard for you because u have a baby...and i dont think he will have chance to go outside the airbase for money remittances.. probably it would be hard for both of you..|`|3Lop7iWNaa	It's plenty of money.  I'm enlisted in the Air Force, I have three kids, and my wife doesn't work.

I haven't had to borrow money, and we have a nice amount in savings right now. the thing about the military, is that the pay is guaranteed. just cut out the unnecessary items, pay your bills first. always. and you'll be fine. hey, i'm 19, and i'm doing it! lol. you'll hate it and love being a military wife, it has it's perks, and it also has a BIG price to pay. just be strong. that's all i can really say. make sure you have all your paperwork in order! always. lol. and save EVERY LITTLE PAPER the military gives you! they tend to lose LOTS of things. lol. my email is kathryn_ethan16@yahoo.com, if you ever need anything, don't hesitate to email me. hope i helped! :)

We have laws in our country that protect workers rights these businesses hire the illegals to get around those laws.those businesses should be closed down and there owners and operators prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.|`|fjCxv2I4aa	no,they are not but a small part of the economic problems here.the economic problems were cause by the free trade agreements that cost a significant part of our manufacturing base,followed by mismanagement of banks/real estate/corporations.|`|HbIv7DV2aa	Gee.

SeqRrVmIaa	Legally it is on American soil. We have a hundred year lease which requires the approval of BOTH parties to cancel. The UCMJ would apply rather than civilian law since it is a military base. The Geneva Conventions would apply to prisoners held there or anywhere in the world.

eb4134143bcb36114275325ce8dffe26aa	As an adult, you have a duty to know your rights as well as your duties and responsibilities under the law!  Ignorance of the law is not a defence!!!  And to be honest, how can you even claim ignorance?  You admit to being a senior and the girl is a freshman (three grades beneath you), so you must have known she was under the age of 16!<br>  <br>  Anyway, you have committed the crime of statutory rape (the prosecutor could escalate this charge, just so you know).  At 14, the girl cannot legally consent to sex period.  Frankly speaking, you need a very good lawyer...the best you can afford as you are in deep trouble (facing a Class B or C felony, depending upon whether or not they can prove you forced her).  I suggest you read the link below (the actual Wisconsin law), in particular, 948.02(1) & (2).<br>  <br>  As for your penalty....at the very least, probation, but possibly jail or prison (the girl is only 14 and you had to be aware that she was several grades behind you).  You could also be heavily fined and most likely you will have to register as a SEX OFFENDER for the rest of your life.  <br>  <br>  You will not be permitted to enter the armed forces either with an adult sex offence on your record as you will not be "of good character".  You can also expect this to affect your ability to attend university as well as be employed.  And you may not be able to live in certain locations in the future if you are designated as a "sex offender".<br>  <br>  By the way, you should know that cops lie (they only have a duty to tell the truth when they are "sworn") and there are no brownie points from the judge for telling the cops the truth, especially when it is in your best interest to keep quiet.  You should also know by now that ANYTHING you say can be used in evidence AGAINST you so you should act on your legal right NOT to incriminate yourself...ie. keep your mouth SHUT and only speak through your lawyer!<br>  <br>  One last thing...I would love to tell you what I think of you...but I don't need to.  When you go in front of a judge, he is going to say all that I could...and more.|`|CVVl4U4caa	Grammar. <br>  P.S. does your keyboard not have an "O"?<br>  <br>  . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-‘”. . . . . . . . . .``~.,<br>  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-”. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .“-.,<br>  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ”:,<br>  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,<br>  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}<br>  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}<br>  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:”. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .“~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./<br>  . . . . . . /(_. . ”~,_. . . ..“~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/<br>  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .”=,_. . . .“-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~”; /. .. .}<br>  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .”=-._. . .“;,,./`. . /” . . . ./. .. ../<br>  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..“~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../<br>  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-”<br>  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\<br>  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__<br>  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,<br>  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _\. . . . . ._,-%. . . ..`\|`|diCASlUXaa	It's best to find someone your own age.<br>  Be more careful about what you do.|`|O6x1CTd4aa	You are in some serious trouble, below is taken from the Wisconsin site about penalties<br>  For a Class C Felony, the penalty is a fine of up to $100,000, or imprisonment of up to 40 years, or both; however, for a repeat offender, the term of imprisonment may increase up to 2 years with prior misdemeanor convictions, and up to 6 years with a prior felony conviction.|`|giBfNMX6aa	Case in point that good people can go to jail for being stupid.

You should know that you cannot consent to sex under the age of 18!   The following is the Massachusetts Law.<br>  <br>  "CHAPTER 272. CRIMES AGAINST CHASTITY, MORALITY, DECENCY AND GOOD ORDER <br>  <br>  "Chapter 272: Section 4. Inducing person under eighteen to have sexual intercourse <br>  "Section 4. Whoever induces any person under 18 years of age of chaste life to have unlawful sexual intercourse shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than three years or in a jail or house of correction for not more than two and one-half years or by a fine of not more than $1,000 or by both such fine and imprisonment."<br>  <br>  And then there is this little bit of law that I bet your friend is unfamiliar with:<br>  <br>  "CHAPTER 272. CRIMES AGAINST CHASTITY, MORALITY, DECENCY AND GOOD ORDER <br>  <br>  Chapter 272: Section 18. Fornication <br>  Section 18. Whoever commits fornication shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than three months or by a fine of not more than thirty dollars"<br>  <br>  Not being a lawyer, I can't confirm the interpretation of the following bit of law but it could mean your friend's salvation.

Tempo Banding is the Air Force's new method of trying to give some predictability to your deployment schedule.  I personally am in Tempo Band C which is 6 months deployment out of every 2 years.  During my vulnerability window for being picked up for deployment a tasking did not come down to my unit for my job skill/rank therefore I did not deploy.  Security Forces are heavily tasked and I'm not sure how often they get skipped when they are in their vulnerability window.|`|PVnKQG8Waa	air force deployments are 4 month long. What a sham, if i was going to deploy 4 months, i would not even give my address to family members. By the time I start missing home its already time to go back.|`|3Lop7iWNaa	It depends on the career field you are in.  For people like EOD, Security Forces, Civil Engineers and Special Forces it can be 6 months or longer.  Most career fields are 4 months though.  <br>  <br>  For flying crews it can be totally different.  Some times flying crews do 6 month rotations, and sometimes they just take a lot of 1-2 week missions.<br>  <br>  Out of  all the services Air Force has the shortest deployments.|`|wufKLi6Haa	It all depends on your unit and their deployment schedule. But that sounds fairly typical.

yQ0OzEbZaa	I would consider Hitler a villain.  Hitler held many hysterical beliefs which not only include, God and Providence but also Fate, Social Darwinism, and ideological politics. In Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, he spoke, unashamedly, about God, fanaticism, idealism, dogma, and the power of propaganda. Hitler held strong faith in all his convictions. He justified his fight for the German people and against Jews by using Godly and Biblical reasoning. <br>  <br>  This is a quote that I think is one of his most revealing statements that makes this quite clear:<br>  <br>  "Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord."<br>  <br>  o_O|`|zLUQJxJkaa	The only possible thing to call him a hero for is he united Germany.. but under force.

They always tell me to be patient and to give the guy a chance. But, honestly, how much more of a chance should we give him? Every single one of his decisions so far have done nothing but increase the size and power of the federal government. And in the long run, more government power only means more domestic well-being and economic problems. He has done nothing to help the economy. Liberals need to face the fact that more printing, taxing and spending by the government will not help the economy, but it will hurt it. If they honestly understood the American economy, they would want the government to leave it alone. Yea, the recession sucks. But the faster the troubled markets hit rock bottom, the faster they are on their way back up to the top. I don't see what is so hard to understand about the theory that our economy will always fix itself. It always has, and it always should as long as the government keeps their slimy fingers off of it.<br>  <br>  As far as our new foreign policy goes, I haven't made a decision on whether President Obama is handling it correctly or not. So far, he's done a decent job but only time will tell if he's as good of a foreign policy president as both George Bushes, Ronald Reagen and FDR or as pathetic and cowardly of a foreign policy president as Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. <br>  <br>  But I do think we should give President Obama at least a little bit of room to breathe because all this crap isn't truly the doing of Obama himself. It's mainly the fault of the radically liberal dominated congress. I dunno. We just have to wait out the liberal storm for, at least, the next two years.

They have been making the financial people make loans to them since Slick Willie, so it's been what 10-11 years.  How can that not know what amount of these people will punt on the mortgage?  They know when they loan to them on autos or give them a credit card.  <br>  <br>  So we know that these folks have been being foreclosed on for over a decade and they just didn't jump up and do it.  There is something else going on and I wonder if it is the $70 trillion in bank to bank un accounted financial transactions.<br>  <br>  So all these people did just punt on their homes.  You see these poor folks get in a home, have to move, and instead of just paying a phone and or electric bill, they now have water, garbage, electric phone, cable and then the biggie the property taxes!.  Yes some were put in at a $500 note that was going to go to $1,000 in a year, but they have either stayed or cleared out.<br>  <br>  but back to the presidents.  Clinton did good by shorting the military, Bush popped up and not only funded the military, but also started the wars and used Reaganomics to boot!  Obama is now using the same spending that the other two did, but larger and also has the same wars.  Somebody is going to have to buckle down and pay taxes.  Sorry.<br>  <br>  Also it would help if his messages didn't have the gloomy side.

But most people are polite if you make the effort and will be happy to speak English with you. Also, if I may suggest an alternative, Swden is very close to Germany, and quite similar in some ways. Everyone speaks English perfectly and actually enjoy talking to forigners in English. At least, that was my experience.

aVEVchFxaa	Derek, I've been wondering and asking the same thing. They won't own up to not holding Bush accountable They'll squish and squirm all around this question. I guess that we are suppose to believe that they had no problem with Bush throwing all that taxpayer money around. Bush, ... the Republican. No he's not a "dem" or a "lib", he's a gosh darn Republican and Conservative. And the few( that was a blatant rigged election) that actually voted for him, voted him in on that basis. (Because he's a Republican.) This whole thing is quite comical. It's OK when Bush did it, but not OK for any "half black" /"black" or "dem" President to do it. They cussed people for saying that Bush was going to ruin this country, and that the country as we know it was coming to an end under the Bush admin. Called those people "unpatriotic" for talking bad about him for all his damage. YET, they are doing the exact SAME thing to Obama. Obama who hasn't even done EIGHT years yet. He hasn't even done a year yet. This is all beyond being hypocritical.

Too many republicans were for it though.  A better question is where are the democrats who voted for all the spending while Bush was in office and then run to the media complaining about Bush running up the deficit and the national debt?  You would think that after complaining about it for 8 years some of them would think that tripling the deficit in Obama's first 30 days would not be a good idea.|`|nIv9MmXHaa	In addition:<br>  <br>  The republicans said their TARP bailout was to get the banks started so that credit would flow which, in turn, would re-start the economy.<br>  <br>  The banks and wall st got their desired TARP.

AA11707728	I think the whole incident was hilarious, symbolic and deeply disturbing.  Communism is EVIL......evil as only something responsible for the extermination of hundreds of millions of innocent people can be.  The rusians KNOW it is evil.  More to the point they know that it is completely antithetical to American ideals.  Such a thing should be obvious to even a brain dead moron. Yet, our culture continues to spawn people even more stupid than a brain dead moron.  People who admire communism, ignore the evil it is responsible for (and would, if given a chance, repeat) and, instead, consider our own way of life as somehow suspect.  People like, Hillary Clinton, for example.  <br>  <br>  Clinton's actions here are meant to blame the friction between russia and America on bad policy by conservatives.  She meant to imply that with a new administration, everything would be OK now and that the US and russia could get a fresh start.  Everyone in the friggin world but Clinton and the other liberals knows what a bad idea that is.  Putin is an evil dork who will screw us the first chance he gets.  It should be obvious to everyone but an idiot.<br>  <br>  And what does Clinton's little snafu with the misspelling on her little plastic toy show....that she's AN IDIOT.<br>  <br>  Oh how Putin must have laughed and laughed and laughed.  Probably glanced up at a painting of Stalin in his office and joked, "boy, what a typical American idiot"......."but useful....eh comrade".|`|6B1sxgtOaa	It is defaulty.

A90SRsTxaa	Yes it is very young, but for a republic it is old. I think we have already outlived any other republic of this type. Good luck USA. I hope we can keep our rightsssssss..........|`|Y0CoQkeWaa	The reason US is so young yet so powerful is because it is also very large in size, keep in mind it is compromised of 50 states a lot of which are the size of average countries. The US is resource rich and most of the land is habitable (unlike Canada, Russia). Lastly, US also has alot of hardworking people in it that makes it the country it is today.|`|AA10895669	To answer the second part of your question first. It's because of our Freedoms and our Unity and Respect for individuals, that allowed our country to build itself into a great nation. The principles of freedom and a free economy actually result in wealth and prosperity of all.<br>  <br>  And yes, as a Republic goes we are one of the oldest actually last. The older countries have actually had many other forms of governments. It's just that the land mass and people residing on them in civilized was has been around longer.<br>  <br>  The forms of governments that fail fastest have always been Dictatorships and Socialist Countries. The people don't have control over themselves and grow weary because they are not satisfied at which time they move to change the government.<br>  <br>  We have just seen a microcasim of this change in the majority of people today have no patience and no resolve to do the things required of them to prosper individually. There was once a time (and it can still be seen with the illegal immigration problems) that people wanted to come here to this country because they new they could pursue a life where they were free to build a business, a family, a country (the great American dream).<br>  <br>  Many in this country don't know what we have, or why we have it, but are very willing to condemn it and claim we are wrong because we are so powerful and our people are still poor. Fact, The poorest person in this country, is rich and wealthy compared to some of the really poor people in the poorest nations of the world. The same people will also complain that we act aggressive or oppressive to other countries. When our country is the largest provider to the welfare of other nations, and has liberated other nations, more then any other nation.<br>  <br>  There is a propaganda driven culture out there, that is basically communist and fascist (it can not stand on it's own because people will fear what it really stands for, so it lies). We don't recognize this because it masquerades as being nurturing and for the well being of the victim, when in actuality the extremes of this culture hate America and want it to fail so they can justify what is it they are. And it's ideology simply does not work. Read Govenor Bradshaws discription of the founding of Plymouth MA and his interpertation of the real meaning of Thanksgiving.<br>  <br>  It has become understood and shown in many political movements and in the current climate of our nation, that Joe McCarthy was right.|`|bc31594d662102e5c53e9da54ca5195baa	Young is relative. The US as a state is young. But it didn't<br>  come from nothing. The US was European at a point in time.<br>  So age has nothing to do with it. It's a power vacuum left<br>  by the Europeans when they clashed twice in less than 40<br>  years. Took them nearly 50 years to recover from their 2nd<br>  clash and with that the stage was empty for us and the<br>  Soviets. The Soviets failed. So that's us left.|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	our power is in the DOLLAR that we have!!|`|f153f5c587854a64f0b19f95ee388282aa	Because we don't take **** from anybody and we value our allies.
b6c9b3f40f9ac8337ea22396c739b02faa	A lot of people need some level of privacy, and in that situation, there's little opportunity for that. Heaven forbid one of you gets a girlfriend or a boyfriend. What are you going to do, take turns in the one bedroom? ACK! Not to mention that plenty of people have at least one child, and that would not be an appropriate situation for a child.<br>  <br>  BUT SERIOUSLY... It's a shame that working fulltime for minimum wage can't get you your OWN one bedroom apartment, or even a studio! I mean, is that too much to ask?!|`|5Ho518J9aa	There is nothing at all wrong with it. You raise a good question. When I was a kid, my family lived in a one bedroom cabin, with a sleeping loft over top. No electricity, no running water. Outdoor plumbing. If we weren't starving, it would have been the best time of my life. My brothers and I loved it. My sister was old enough to know we were poor, she hated it. But you know what? We made it, and now we are ALL doing quite well. You and your friends are doing the right thing. Save your money.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Well, for starters, many low income people have children. In every state I know of, you must provide a child with certain standards of living...some being that girl and boy children can't sleep in the same room together after a certain age, that children can't be made to live in a home that doesn't meet their basic needs. While many people still DO just as you do, if CPS is called, those children can be removed from the home for any number of reasons--especially if the home isn't safe or adequate for the children's needs. Many others are too old or disabled, and unable to live in apartment housing....though I would say that there are MANY who DO exactly what you do.|`|4BoteYDwaa	I tried it, and I hated every minute of it. I've a short list of the reasons I hated it. I'm not being wise, this is just how I feel about it. I say do whatever it takes to survive, but the fact is, with 4 people living there, you could probably afford a rental house at least.<br>  1. No privacy-I could never bring home a date knowing that 3 other people are gonna be sitting around the room when you want to "get things done".<br>  2. Usually only one bathroom, and an economy size water heater. Which means at least one person is always gonna be stuck taking a cold shower.<br>  3. Someone always gets stuck on the couch, when someone else wants to sleep in the bed.<br>  4. There is always someone who thinks they have to make rules for everyone else. I'm an adult, why should any one be telling me when my bedtime is?<br>  5. If everyone has a different work schedule, there is usually at least one person who is kept awake by the others staying up and partying.<br>  6. Usually, there is at least one mooch in the house that is too cheap to buy their own food. Which means that sandwich you hid in the back of the fridge for later will mysteriously disappear.<br>  This list goes on and on.|`|AA11963685	Many, many do.  But most of them are either young and childless or seniors.  Most people with kids have a hard time finding roommates because people don't want to deal with other people's brats.  Those who do this know how to save money where they can.  It's not always a good time living with other people out of necessity, but it's better than starving.|`|IDWlqSY2aa	People seem to want their space nowadays.

Reagan ran up the deficit like no president before him. There was no spending freeze.|`|BIQrsl4paa	The theory of FISCAL SANITY, unlike what we now face from the Democrats.|`|BNHocZaiaa	It makes little difference at this point.  If the banks collapse and we fall into a depression, or the Federal Reserve prints so much money that we fall into a depression, either way we're going to return to a much more responsible way of life, but there's going to be a lot of pain along the way.  Those stockbrokers really were jumping out windows in '29.  Imagine what they'll be doing today.<br>  <br>  The ONLY thing that is going to get us back on track is for the economy to collapse.  Prices have to fall to realistic places so that the average person can afford to buy a home with a typical working man's salary.  When you need to adults making 60-70 thousand dollars each just to afford a middle class lifestyle with a kid or two, something is seriously wrong.  My father bought his house in 1971 for $36,000, and he was making about $30,000 a year.  He had four kids, paid his mortgage and supported a family by himself!  And he took us on vacation every summer with that salary.

1d521d1ad2fdf38cda15eff82d979ed9aa	It is a state issue, Oregon has an assisted suicide law that has gone to the US Supreme Court and been upheld.<br>  <br>  October 5, 2005: U.S. Supreme Court hears oral arguments in the case of Gonzales v. State of Oregon.<br>  <br>  January 17, 2006: The U.S. Supreme Court files its opinion and upholds the 9th U.S. District Court of Appeals' decision.  Oregon's law remains in effect.<br>  <br>  Statement of the Oregon Attorney General:<br>  "Today's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court clearly affirms the authority of Oregon, and every other state, to determine the scope of the practice of medicine within its borders. Attorney General Gonzales, and Attorney General Ashcroft before him, exceeded the authority granted to the Department of Justice by Congress in attempting to effectively strike down Oregon's law. This decision is an important victory for Oregonians. Equally important, it is a victory for patients, physicians and other caregivers in each and every state in our nation."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/ph/pas/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/ph/pas/</a>|`|BDekKJYbaa	not sure where you live but that topic was in the la times within this past week. as of rite now there is nothing the court can do because there is no law saying that it is illegal to be in the presence of a suicide. what assisted suicide groups are doing is bringing supplies (helium and a plastic bag) to those who want to die and let them do it on their own. that way there is no liability.|`|K62i9b6laa	It is legal in certain states.<br>  <br>  So I'm assuming it's a states issue.|`|6Gfz125Paa	It's already legal in 2 states (Oregon and Washington).  The supreme court ruled in Gonzales v. Oregon that the federal government cannot stop states from legalizing it.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	I imagine it would be left up to states but then people would move to those states in order to assist the suicide.  Having worked with Hospice patients who are given liberal amounts of painkillers, and seeing people with intractable pain that cannot be treated, I would like to see it legalized.<br>  <br>  I worked with a doctor whose mother suffered terribly.  She could not stand the lightest touch of anything on her skin.  So she screamed in agony all day long.  This doctor asked for a few minutes alone with her. I went in as soon as he left and found her dead.  Her morphine drip was wide open.  He had opened it so her heart and breathing would stop.  I shut it off and recorded the time of death without saying a word about the morphine.   I would have done the same for my mother if she only had days to live but was in such agony.
AzeOk29saa	wow, yes ...|`|1wIek546aa	no, because the "legal abortion" crew doesn't believe a embryo is a fully functioning human being. the arguments are on very separate ends of the scale. <br>  <br>  though i am in favor of medically assisted suicide.|`|4fec4ea747f6932e5c8ee96dfca876efaa	legalize both, no arguments,|`|PR28wVHzaa	I don't know if they can be compared, but I think both should be legal.|`|bDUNBvKbaa	Yes.

HZvdr8VLaa	You need to investigate your state laws.  The laws vary greatly from state to state and even city to city.  Add some details for a good answer.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Depends on the state.<br>  <br>  In Illinois you need a FOID for any type of gun.  In California, you need an HSC for a handgun only, not a shotgun.  In Texas, you don't need a permit to own it, only to carry it.|`|A90SRsTxaa	You only need a permit to carry a concealed weapon.|`|UgFntgI9aa	The laws vary by state and it depends on type of weapon also.  Handguns will be more regulated than long guns for example.  Google your state legal statutes, they're usually available online.  <br>  <br>  Or walk into a gun shop and ask the guy.|`|r8drw5Dcaa	You need a permit to buy and sell guns.<br>  You need a gun license to carry a hand gun in most states.<br>  You can get fill out a permit application at the local gun shops.|`|73c9d4fa33559b0b87d0a9b88bc8f2a3aa	no. you need permits to modify or sell guns.|`|iYBnJxcnaa	if you live in California, you need a permit granted to you by the chief of police, (not likely happen). That is only for consealed weapons anyways. I thought you should know this for your own good.
AA10780838	There is no federal regulation restricting green card holders from owning or possessing handguns only based on their immigration status.  Some states might have restrictions.<br>  <br>  In Texas, Permanent Residents are allowed to own guns and get concealed handgun licenses.  They just have to put their A number on the transfer form.<br>  <br>  Even non immigrant aliens may be able to get concealed handgun licenses.  The reg states anyone who meets the criteria and is eligible under federal law to purchase a handgun.  non resident aliens with a hunting license are eligible to purchase a handgun.<br>  <br>  The only problems would be felony convictions, convictions of crimes of domestic violence, mental illness rendering the person incapable of exercising sound judgement, chemical dependency, etc.|`|K4Y76H3qaa	It all depends on the State you live in..Also, you must have a government issue I.D. to run a background check when purchase a gun..

"Cool" is a matter of marketing which is a matter of manipulation.  The two major parties who have run this country into the ground jointly don't do anything but have marketing wars.

No principles just doing whatever it takes to grasp power for various special interests which equates to public funds in private hands.  Obama is not exception of course.<br>  <br>  The young voters are always going to be the more easily manipulated.

Support education. Instead of letting Obama do everything to make college affordable, they could support him in this and even bring their own ideas to the table.<br>  2. Admit that Bush wasn't all that great of a president. It would help them put the past behind them.<br>  3. Give Rush Limbaugh the boot. Call him out. Quit apologizing to him.<br>  4. Not have most of their 2012 candidates be people who ran in 2008.<br>  5. John McCain wants to restore the line item veto. The other Republicans should support him in this.<br>  6. Come up with their own plans for an economic stimulus and handling the mortgage/housing market problems.<br>  7.  Less focus on social issues. If they're going to be anti-gay-marriage, they could at least talk about gay marriage less and talk about the future of our country more. And drop the ridiculously ideological opposition to stem cell research (Which they oppose only because the far right thinks it has something to do with abortion, somehow)|`|0eFSeap5aa	Sit back and watch the Democrats blow it.|`|ciAAdMd2aa	For starters, someone in the party needs to stand up to Rush Limbaugh.  Rush only appeals to middle aged white men mostly from the south.<br>  <br>  If the left is constantly calling Rush the de facto leader of the Republican party AND Rush is also proclaiming and bragging that he is then the GOP has big problems with courting new demographics.

The trouble is, people wait too long.  As soon as they get laid off or other financial trouble, they should ask for interest only payments.  If the trouble continues, there are other programs that can help them, like deferred payments.<br>  <br>  If they lost the home, they will have to live with family for friends and save as much as possible.  Then pay as many months' rent as they can upfront.  Private owners are usually more willing to take a chance on people.  They might have to look for alternative housing, like trailers.<br>  <br>  They should start immediately to rebuild their credit.  They can get a buy here, pay here, car. They will pay enormous interest rates but it will help build their credit back up.  Their highest priority should be their credit and saving money.  Staying out of debt.|`|G350VVknaa	Right, and that's why the President is trying to do something about it, while he faces stonewalling jerks and obstructionists.

The next day she had flowers on her doorstep, and a mailbox full of well wishes and offers to drive her to Church on Sunday. Will we all be OK? Yep. Paul's Pizza, the first store as you come into town, flies the "Don't Tread On Me" flag out front. The last thing you see as you LEAVE town is the Gun Club sign.

No.  But if that police officer was shooting at a jaywalker, missed and killed somebody, then he may be.  It all depends on the particular situation.  But if there is an accidental death while he or she is in the line of their honest and legal duties, then no, they wont be charged and depending on what the bad guy was doing, he or she may be.|`|mVcXnxKGaa	The driver would get charged with any damage or injury caused during a chase.  The cop, as long he was not being totally reckless, would not be charged.|`|AcsvmXY4aa	in the end it wont be the police's fault, it never is|`|zGpfGc2Taa	If the driver being chased slammed on his breaks, forcing the officer to crash into him, the driver being chased would most likely be charged with reckless driving (as well as whatever he was being chased for).<br>  <br>  If the officer hit the driver in an attempt to perform a maneuver to end the chase, and the driver happened to hit another car in the process, I don't think anyone would be charged for the accident.  However, the accident would be added to the drivers damages in the chase.

For example, we have 350 million people in this country. If the government decides that it needs to raise 350 million dollars for something and raises a tax for it... we all throw in 1 dollar each.<br>  <br>  The 16th amendment changed that, (if you actually believe that it was legally ratified, which is still in question to this day), and allowed for an unaproportion tax on "income". Not only unaportioned but graduated so that the more money you make, the higher the percentage of YOUR money is taken in taxes.<br>  <br>  The reason for this is quite simple!<br>  <br>  The government would have a damn hard time selling tax increases if it effected everyone equally as it should. <br>  <br>  So, now they can get their tax increases by only taxing "The Rich"...<br>  They simply tell the other 98% of the people that "this new tax will not effect YOU",, and all of the sudden a large majority no longer care if they decide to steal money from someone else, just so it isn't ME!<br>  <br>  These people typically enjoy seeing someone else being robbed by the federal government.... <br>  <br>  It's about control!  They can get whatever they want passed by a vote in this manner. All they need is a majority and, regardless of how much money you make, you still only get one vote.<br>  <br>  May I suggest that you take a close look our Constitution to find the facts and an even closer look in the mirror to find the reason why you get pleasure by watching your fellow Americans, (the rich ones), violated by theft...|`|6dc142d6debf8ac8ecf1a989c32e7a34aa	It concerns me deeply that we have hit the ten trillion dollar deficit mark.  However, just by simply having the rich pay more will not get us out of debt.  First problem is that the definition of rich varies from person to person.  Even Obama keep changing his rich cutoff line during his campaign (annual salaries going from 400,000 to 300,000 to 250,000 to 200,000 to 170,000).  Granted that is a nice sum of money, keep in mind that Obama wanted to raise taxes on people making 42,000 when he was in the Senate.  Funny that he wants to raise taxes and several staff members in his administration could not even pay their own taxes (including Tim "TurboTax" Geithner).  Also, check out the salaries of our congressmen and guess how many of them evade or cut corners when it comes to their paying taxes (and yes, nearly half of them are millionaires).<br>  <br>  In regards to China, there are a couple things that you have overlooked.  First, China is no longer "picking up the tab" when it comes to purchasing American credit.  In fact, the same day that speculation about GM's bankruptcy came out, China announced that it would not purchase further American futures.  Second, the communist nation only started making money when it shifted its economy to a market-based system while retaining a communist regime.  In other words, the Chinese decided to shift their economy to a capitalist system . . . hence why they are actually booming.  Prior to that shift, China was not nearly as wealthy even with the level of business it was maintaining.  It also helped their economy when Hong Kong returned to Chinese control from British rule.<br>  <br>  While it is nice to see the rich pay more, I wonder if you realize that approximately 20% of Americans do not pay taxes at all and a higher percentage pay less than they are supposed to.  Look at a former Obama cabinet nominee (Tom Daschle) who neglected to pay over $100,000 in taxes and called it "a minor oversight".  Also, rich people can also hire top notch tax attorneys and accountants that can hide extravagant loopholes that will lead to them paying less taxes.  I would rather see everyone pay their taxes properly, not just the rich.  <br>  <br>  And for China bombing us, they are pretty much just going to own us practically outright.  It was like years ago when Japan was buying up eveyrything over here, including land and companies.  At this rate, we will be handing I.O.U.s to China and have to do stupid human tricks to appease them.|`|aqeWwA71aa	This country is in a LOT of trouble thanx to Li'l Bush and the pinhead republicans.  But it doesn't really matter - we will all survive - and it will happen day by day - and we have to make the best decisions we can as we go along.<br>  <br>  For YEARS banks like Chase Manhattan have paid NO tax while idiot right wingers sat in their trailers and told glowing Reagan stories.

But as long as we have the Federal Reserve, and a central banking system, we will never be out of debt. we have been in debt to the Federal Reserve since 1933 when the Federal Reserve Act was signed. We can never get out of debt either, because each dollar loaned to the gov. from the Fed is loaned at an interest on every dollar. The only way we can pay off that money is with more loans. If every debt in the U.S. was paid off, there would be no money in circulation. Just keep in mind that money has absolutely no value, money is debt and nothing else. The only value it has, is the value YOU give it.

Are you afraid in spite of the identity security provided by Yahoo or are you feeling guilty? OK to your question now:<br>  <br>  Yes, today's news says that the seat sharing reportedly finalised yesterday seem to hang in balance.. Could be the work of Congress or any opponent competing for political power.. what is the great mistake in it?! <br>  <br>  May be she is usually against the Hindus - playing minority cards frequently and disowning Hindu sentiments often, whether it is Sethu Project issue or the Hussein paintings hurting Hindus, etc - but just in the election issue, she would be playing the normal political game for access to power I think.. But what amuses me is that the Orissa govt was till recently dubbed as communal and now congress wishes to have its truck with the ruling Patnaiks..!<br>  <br>  A friend here says the Ms Sonia married a hindu and became an Indian and all that.. Yes but she also revealed her narrow Italian connections by influencing the CBI to allow Quadrochi to escape and played dubious games in having a party faithful for the Presidency and a partisan bureaucrat as EC!! She misused powers to dislodge the Jharkand govt to place the one with criminal background as its CM, just to reward for his casting the confidence vote! She got disrepute by framing UP leaders like Mulayam in criminal cases and withdrawing them when they struck political deals, inviting rebukes to CBI by the judiciary..! I stop here as the list would be endless..!!<br>  <br>  BJP is in real problems elsewhere too and I do fear that the only defendents of Hindu sentiments would be having tough time in the elections.. But we have to think beyond our narrow community interests.. national interests also demand that a more principled party like BJP comes to power.. <br>  <br>  They are deliberately labelled as communal (for often defending Hindu values) by the pseudo secular media and the discredited parties, which have no guts to question the violence of minorities like the one unleashed on the Bangladesh free lancer (in Hyderabad) or the killing of Hindu kar sevaks or saints or hostile anti Hindu pamphlets circulated in Karnataka that fuelled avoidable outbursts by some locals..!!<br>  <br>  I, like many Hindus do feel that the BJP need not bring the Ayodhya or HIndutva views as election issues and feed the mischievous media and the opponents to spread false motives.. There is no sin having a temple in Ayodhya but it need not be an election issue as we are not narrow community, as many other fundamentalist outfits..<br>  <br>  Again it is best for the BJP to get detached from the narrow regional chauvinists like the Thackery group or ones with criminal record like MR Soren. A righteous party should not take help from dubious groups for its success.<br>  <br>  Let us see how things turn for the country..! If you believe in the merit of honest and good policies being rewarded ultimately, then you should not be afraid of the moves of the unprincipled power mongers who have their democratic rights to work for their interests.. <br>  <br>  The principled parties should also seek righteous means to earn their power. Cheap support for parochial elements as in Karnataka (Hogenakkal / Cauvery issues) or mindless emotional  support to the pro-LTTE Tamil outfits (Tamilnadu) are most unwise and against the priciples of fair play and national integrity..<br>  <br>  And above all, Dharma should be relied to play its role at the right time - not cheap tricks aping the unprincipled political groups!|`|cWuumdy7aa	BJD and BJP are jointly in alliance and the news of split are false|`|CUdQ2ymEaa	Sonia strikes Who?

p2G5KJywaa	He gave his reasons. Muhammad was/is the central human figure of Islam, regarded by Muslims as the messenger and last prophet of God. Also active as a diplomat, merchant, philosopher, orator, legislator, reformer, and military leader.<br>  He played a bigger role in the lives of his people than Jesus. People who have and are making monumental impacts on humanity. Not necessarily for the better. Most influential doesn't have to be a positive effect.<br>  <br>  Most of his top ten are spiritual people though. Jesus came in 3rd behind Newton so...what's that tell you?<br>  <br>  I'd think Gandhi would've been in the top 10....he didn't even make the list?

There is plenty of blame to pass around in Detroit, during the 70's and 80's when companies agreed (remember the companies agreed to these contracts with the union.) non of those parties involved ever saw the massive increases coming in healthcare. I would agree a union employee is better off when and if the company they are working for goes under, when compared to a non-union employee in the same job. <br>  <br>  Yes unions are important, many of the benifits enjoyed by all workers have came as a result of the union, holliday pay, the 40 hour work week, overtime after 40 hours. Companies want the public to blame the union for the problems they sometimes face. Instead of looking at their own business practices. Right now everyone is looking at the UAW to make concessions which they are willing to do so long as managment in turn makes concessions.|`|kwT9HCYWaa	Unions are not good at all.

JDltTREfaa	My husband stopped me as I was accelerating in a 60 mph zone because I was coming up the 70 zone.  (He didn't know it was me when he hit me with the laser, but obviously he knew it was me by the time he stopped me.)<br>  <br>  Smart man that he is, he did NOT give me a ticket.  (Hey.  He's gotta live with me.  AND our insurance would have gone up!)   But technically he could have (though I'm not going to tell HIM that) because I wasn't actually at the 70 mph sign when I started hitting the gas.|`|AA11494150	The signs are the starting and stopping points for the speed limit. <br>  <br>  When the speed limit increases, you have to wait until you pass the sign to accelerate. When the speed limit decreases, you must have all your braking done before the sign. <br>  <br>  If the law allowed for a certain distance from the sign, it would be difficult for the motorist to judge that distance. It is much easier to just make the sign the starting point for the new speed limit.|`|Vu7kCPesaa	Technically, yes. Cops love to bust people for this. Technically, you have to wait until you get to the sign to speed up, and, if it goes back down from 55 to 45, by the time you get to the sign, you need to have already slowed down to 45.|`|a8e1KcS2aa	Yes, it is technically illegal to go over the prior posted speed until you cross the threshold of the other sign, however I have yet to meet a cop that would stop you for speeding up about 5 mph more to get up to the next posted speed limit... this is slightly different in residential areas, however, as 5 mph is a %20 of the posted speed, so it's a bit of a bigger change.  I'd recommend counting on the 5 mph cushion for speeds of 35+ mph.|`|93M8Vccvaa	Yes, it is unlawful. In the case that you gave, the speed limit is 45 until you are even with sign that increases to 55. This, as in all traffic violations, is up to the officer as to stop and issue a citation or just ignore it. (Officer's discretion).|`|TFizPrvuaa	you have to wait till you get to the sign to speed up|`|mVcXnxKGaa	In Illinois you cannot reach the higher speed until you reach the sign.  For a lowering limit, it is not supposed to be enforced until 500 ft after the posted speed limit change.|`|szUPLa7qaa	Until that sign it is unlawful and you can get a highway patrol to speedtrap you for doing so before.|`|8SqYyM0jaa	Depends on the cop and your attitude if the cop pulls you over.

SXRdNW80aa	I got on with a local sheriff's department not too long ago, and the policy at our department is to start everyone in the jail, ie corrections. As the other officer said, it is a great way to learn about law enforcement and decide if it is right for you. You are in constant contact with criminals, the general public, and even road officers. Most departments like this "promote from within". You might move up to working in the courts or transport before being offered a patrol position. I love the work, but I've always wanted to do this and it does run in the family. Congratulations on being interested, it really is rewarding work.|`|o3JnacTPaa	At many sheriff departments,you start out in the jail for a little while,and then you ride along with an FTO(field training officer) for a couple of weeks.After you complete FTO training,you are on your own for patrol<br>  <br>  The same goes for police departments,except you don't start off in the jail,instead you are on a probationary period.|`|AA11494150	Some sheriffs departments start you out in the jail. The theory is it gives you a chance to interact with people in a controlled environment before you go on patrol Others hire non-sworn corrections officers for the jail, so you start on the road in patrol. <br>  <br>  With a police department, you will start on patrol.<br>  <br>  You are not normally asked to transfer out of patrol. There are usually enough people that sign up for the other assignments.

That means that the drill instructors will do everything in their power to graduate you. Its easier to graduate boot camp than to quit it now.. The dropout rate is extremely low. The only way you can get out is if you get injured to the point where it can't be fixed or something like that. Marine boot camp is no harder than any other branch of services boot camp. Its just longer and a little bit more PT. But other than that, an airmen, sailor, and a soldier's basic can be as hard marine boot camp.|`|SeqRrVmIaa	About 1 of 8 recruits don't make it through Marine recruit training. It's tough but the time goes quickly. You are always busy and learning. It's worth the effort to become a Marine; you'll accomplish something many can't do and you'll always be proud of it.

pss8LblLaa	I am a 2E1X1 and it is a decent career field.  There is a major overhaul to AFSC's in the Air Force to combine/realign certain job skills so some of the AFSC's you listed will change somewhat.  Anything that begins with a 2E is an electronic maintenance job.  You would be responsible for actually performing the repair and upkeep and operation of the system you work on.  3C jobs do not normally entail the repair/maintenance aspect.  They are more of an operations/administration type job.  Some general notes per your list.<br>  <br>  2E1X1: Repairs/maintains deployable or fixed SATCOM ground sites.  There are some other equipment types but majority is SATCOM.<br>  <br>  2E2X1: Repairs/maintains the computerized switching systems used by telephone networks to handle/route calls.  Telephone central office.<br>  <br>  3C2X1: First line customer service/trouble shooter for communications circuit issues.  Typically tasks repair people (2E's) to fix problems.<br>  <br>  3C0X1: Very broad career field.  Network administrators, help desk personnel, network security etc.<br>  <br>  3C0X2: I have never met one of these though they are rumored to exist.<br>  <br>  3S0X2: Nothing to do with communications.  This a personellist.  They process paperwork relating to Air Force personnel actions, assignments, promotions, out processing etc.  Administrative/Secretarial type work.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|0TUxsbXzaa	3c is boring like cubicle kina crap. i would go with a 2E. satellite is good and mos def a good skill to learn|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	There is not much you can put in an AF enlistment contract.<br>  <br>  You can have a guaranteed job ( maybe ) or enlist under an Open Aptitude Area <br>  <br>  General<br>  Administration<br>  Mechanical<br>  Electronic<br>  <br>  60% of enlistees enlist under an Open Aptitude area<br>  <br>  You can enlist for 4 years or 6 years.<br>  <br>  You can get advanced enlistment rank if your took JROTC ( 3 years ), eagle scout, more than 24 semester hours of college, or enlist for 6 years.<br>  <br>  <br>  That's basically all you can put in your contract|`|pDu3kBuvaa	I tell everyone that asks that if they have a high enough asvab to look into intelligence preferably 1n3, 1n4, or 1n5

(excepting President, requiring natural born). <br>  You are making an assumption as to the idea that NO ACTOR can possibly have opinions, intelligence, or skills.  I am not referring to any disputes over any particular actor (or actress).. but that you are generalizing based on a person's occupation. You are making the ASSUMPTION that because they acted for a living.. thus, it is proof that their campaign is an act. <br>  It is completely possible that you are guilty of exactly the same... that you read something that there IS a hidden agenda.. and you just believe what YOU hear.|`|qBS4b7Kjaa	Ralph Nader just gets negative....to get elected you have to have some kind of vision that appeals to americans.

Don't go spewing out your hidden agendas as if its American only, every leader lies and has some motives that we aren't aware of.

SEALs do not support any ground forces whatsoever!  They are trained the same, but do completely different tasks!  Force Recon are strictly in the conventional warfare environment.  SEALs conduct operations solely in unconventional warfare.  Then you have the DEVGRU (Seal Team 6), the elite of the elite SEALs.  Those are the guys that TV and media talk about.  They make up about 10% of the whole SEAL entity.  The other SEALs teams are embarked on ARGs just as Marines are.<br>  <br>  And Marines ARE Navy...we are a naval light infantry force.<br>  <br>  There are no other Special Operations unit that is similar to the SEALs, otherwise they would just consolidate all the spec ops units (of all branches) into one unified unit.  That is why there are different units; they have their own duties of operations...while some duties may overlap, but there is a huge marginal difference between Force Recon and SEALs.|`|rxMHRbTzaa	Marine Force Recon is similar to the SEALS.

And i say airborne and ranger because there is no ranger school without airborne that i know of. Now as for delta force... This is an elite force probably the greatest force the US has that the civilians know of.... you dont join it... They select you, if you become an airborne ranger and you excel and are a exceptional soldier you might get pulled out to the delta force test where many will start but a pin out of the haystack will be chosen....

hs9Mibf5aa	The Gentleman above me obviously has No Children! LOL<br>  <br>  Sorry, this is no laughing matter.  We went through (almost the same thing) - we have a 6 year old and our downstairs neighbor would constantly complain about ANY noise, and our child is quiet.  They were just uptight.  It got to the point where they were complaining about 'kids' playing at 2. a.m. - Sorry, my lil one's asleep (as are we) at 2. a.m. and the landlord, fortunately believed us.<br>  <br>  You are not disturbing the peace with normal noise.  Check your lease, and call the local chapter of "Tenants Rights" in your city/town.  If children ARE allowed in your apartment, then they have rights to.  Of course they can't sit there quiet 24/7 - don't put up with this nonsense.  Often some 'neighbours' do it because they dislike children.  Sad.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and fight for your rights!  You have them. :)|`|85jy4Mt0aa	Your neighbors have a right to enjoy peacefully their own residences.  If the TV and children are loud, that is disruptive and in violation of most lease agreements.<br>  <br>  Children can be taught to be respectful of others.  Until you can accomplish that, you might consider renting someplace out in the country.<br>  <br>  You say that you have done nothing wrong.  But you have brought chaos and disruption to the neighbors.  They deserve better.|`|530e3f8d6a946003d76d09039006b8e2aa	I rather doubt that they can kick you out just because other tenants are disturbed by your kids making noise.  They are, after all, just being kids.  Maybe the landlord needs to have better walls and soundproofing.  I just don't see how you can be evicted for this.<br>  <br>  But still, there are limits, even for the noise made by kids being kids.  So you might want to speak to someone in your community who offers free advice on the rights of tenants.  Services like this exist almost everywhere and they can offer you advice that fits the laws and standards of the area you live in.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|5i4vUQhgaa	same thing happened to me when my kids were that age try to talk to the neighbors and see if you cant resolve this on your own you might get further.|`|U88iY2blaa	Meh. Don't listen to the guy who told you to "teach your children to be respectful of others" when your oldest kid is still basically a toddler. You are not going to "teach" toddlers to be silent, nor should you. The person that wrote that knows nothing of kids.<br>  It sounds to me like you have a normal situation with four normal kids. It isn't against the law to have a family. However, it is against the law to harrass people and this does indeed sound like harrassment to me. What a horrible situation to be in. The important thing is to try and keep a good situation for your children. <br>  If I were you, I'd call Child Protective Services and discuss the situation with them. They may be able to file an injunction against the landlord on your behalf, get restraining orders against your neighbors, or at least point you in the right direction for what legal measures can be taken to protect your kids. You shouldn't have to "move to the Country" to have a family. That's ridiculous. It sounds to me like you are being harassed by people who can't stand a little noise, which is their problem, and it's not fair of your landlord to threaten to evict you when he rented you the unit in the first place knowing full well you had four kids. If you do get evicted, you could probably sue him to recover all your moving expenses, and possibly punitive damages as well. Call Child Protective Services, Call the Cops, call any free legal clinic you can find and sue everyone you can, if that's what it takes. You have four small children and that may be inconvenient to your neighbors but that's their problem. If they need things to be that quiet, then maybe THEY need to move to the country. Fight them through every legal means you can. You will probably win. And if they keep harassing you, you might even be able to get them thrown in jail or at the very least sue them for intentional infliction of emotional distress. That'll teach them. Bottom line: Seek legal advice. Do it for the sake of your children. They are way more important than your neighbors.|`|irFvDZmNaa	OK! First point is this! Your house IS NOT A PLAYGROUND. What happens when you go to a neighborhood park during the day? You hear children screaming, playing, and laughing loudly! Therefore, if this is happening inside your "apartment," then you are violating terms on your lease. <br>  <br>  However, if you honestly believe your children are not making much noise, your landlord cannot legally evict you. I would contact a lawyer if things get too serious, and you feel your rights are violated. <br>  <br>  Last point! If you do believe that your children are being loud, then YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for controlling them. They are your children, and you live in an apartment. Therefore, you need to teach your children manners!
lHDff8Braa	I don't think it will ever happen.  The sheep have been brainwashed by the past 8 years of rule-by-fear that nothing the government does will ever be "enough"; as long as they "keep us safe".<br>  <br>  Consider, during the Bush administration, the government was granted the following powers:<br>  <br>  Listen to your phone calls without warrant.<br>  Read your emails without warrant.<br>  Monitor your internet activity without warrant.<br>  Monitor the books you borrow from the library, without warrant.<br>  Monitor the groups you associate with.<br>  Search your house without warrant.<br>  Search your car without warrant.<br>  Collect "evidence" from those places, without warrant.<br>  <br>  On a whim, an American citizen can be declared an "enemy combatant", and:<br>  Detained without charge, in secret.<br>  Denied legal representation.<br>  Denied the right to question his detention.<br>  Shipped to a foreign country for interrogation, in secret.<br>  Tortured, in secret.<br>  Be tried by a military tribunal, in secret.<br>  NOT be granted access to the secret evidence against him.<br>  Convicted based on that secret evidence.<br>  <br>  But since we've been sold the lie that those things "keep us safe", most people don't even recognize they have lost some precious personal freedoms.<br>  <br>  Fear is powerful, and it's too bad that most people don't fear the power the government has given itself.|`|JthubNIsaa	I guess the people will finally rise up when the government steps in and allows fast food chains not to serve the obese.|`|T1n3jt6Zaa	You will lose all freedom after the rise.

SkWzsnuxaa	Being a medic in the Army can be a very rewarding job. But it has to be something you really enjoy doing. Don't forget that in the end it is a job and you are going to do it day in and day out for several years. While you serve as a medic you will have the opportunity to attend many courses that will make you a better medic. You could leave the service as a nationally registered EMT and continue a medical career riding ambulances if that is what you want. You will also have gained a lot of medical knowledge. <br>  <br>  Aside from being a medic, your service in the Army will have earned you the Post 9/11 GI Bill which will pay for 36 months of college or about four years of actually class time. If you have used your time in service wisely and earned or come close to earning your undergraduate degree and can use your GI Bill for your MD or any other graduate degree.

T8nap2Pnaa	well, you can normally adjust status on visa waiver, but you can't extend Visa Waiver status. I'm surprised they let you back in though, usually they won't. Now, if you didn't tell the truth on your previous application, that could make things interesting if you try to adjust now. However, I doubt USCIS will let you file the paperwork to adjust status now, since you already left in the middle of it all before. probably you'll be denied and told to return to file the paperwork and get an immigrant visa back in Ireland. What you should have done was refiled in Ireland at the embassy in Dublin and then come back on the immigrant visa. Even with the problem on the I-864, you can still get a friend or relative in the US to file as a joint sponsor. If you're going to try to do it all here now, I highly recommend getting a good immigration lawyer to help before you start trying to file forms.

All the parties of the developed nation, and most of the less developed nation all have welfare, education and health policies. <br>  <br>  They have those policies because they are mature adults who have high school degrees (or more).|`|mT6b7INZaa	Equal opportunity.

As long as both parties incessantly burden the whole of society with their eggregious spending and legislation of morallity, rather than in the interest of protection our sacred individual rights and liberties, then everybody will bear the chains of oppression.  <br>  <br>  Republicans and Democrats are playing the same game, buddy!|`|RnxxYn8gaa	I'm not sure what they want exactly. But over all I think their primary goals, whether they know it or not, are ultimately what the guy above said and that's to give everyone an equal share of the money, except of course the ruling party, because they will always need more money just by virtue of the fact that they make the decisions. <br>  <br>  A lot of people don't believe that democrats are working towards socialism, but if you look at their philosophy, the bills they've tried to pass as a party, basically just look at their history, and you'll see that the pattern, if left unchecked, would end in socialism that inevitably would give way to corruption, the kind of which would usurp our foundations and the U.S. would become part of mandatory world history like so many others who have risen to the point of having a sphere of influence over the entire world. <br>  <br>  The only difference with us though, and I'm proud to say it, our dominion has been largely political and diplomatic. In other words, we didn't get our power and prestige from militarily crushing and killing off our opposition like all the other empires of history did, we got our power, so far, from mostly diplomatic and political strategies that didn't involve killing and destroying, but instead by threatening, pushing our way into everyone else's business, and being ahead in the technological and military race.<br>  <br>  In other words, we conquered the most succeessfully through the most peaceful means of any other empire to date. Some may say that means we are not an empire at all, and I'd agree, but those who say we are, are not completely wrong either.|`|bYxkUDmoaa	They don't want either!

7e2774dbd0f5dfe71e63e178eb13001baa	Unsurprisingly, there's a lot of ignorant statements on this board.<br>  I'm not sure exactly why there's a connection between blacks and watermelon, but it likely stems from the days of slavery.<br>  <br>  And the racist imagery of blacks and watermelon is pervasive throughout American history. It's not too hard to find the old racist images of blacks drawn as caricatures designed to dehumanize them, watermelon in hand.<br>  <br>  Consider it racist propaganda. <br>  <br>  I read that it's possible that slaves, to get back at the slavedriver, would steal crops, including watermelons. And perhaps white society then started drawing racist imagery to "put them in their place." <br>  <br>  On a side note, it's sad and pathetic to see the ignorant statements posted by many here, obviously showing they know little about America's short history. Perhaps they don't even know what happened more than 10 years ago, if that.<br>  <br>  It's not so much whether it was a watermelon, an orange, or grapes, but the meaning behind it. That's the problem with racism.<br>  <br>  Someone else here said they're Asian, and they wouldn't be offended if someone portrayed Asians eating rice. There are indeed racist images of Asians, and they're printed on T-shirts by companies big and small, and sold for mass consumption. And Asians are often portrayed with slanty eyes, buck teeth, "triangle" hats, etc. etc. And the intent behind such imagery isn't innocent.<br>  <br>  It pains me when a minority individual will deny the racist history and intent behind such imagery. When the racists (who often don't even think they're racist) hear a minority person OK such behavior, they think it gives them full license to continue their racist acts.<br>  <br>  Racism in America is often not as obvious and blatant as it was before. It's often more insidious, but it's still there. Society has grown more complex, and as such, so has racism. There's other racist activities than burning a cross on someone's lawn, or wearing a KKK costume.|`|1ca97aeb1adb840d4eb477bdf71f8911aa	I never figured all this racist crap out.

nbibIzC5aa	In order to become an attorney you must get a law degree from an accredited university.  Whether or not you can find one online I don't know, you should do some research into it.  If you are concerned about your financial situation, then you should consider taking night classes  or go to school part time.  You can also apply for scholarships and pell grants to make things easier.<br>  <br>  As for an additional degree, there is no additional bachelors degree needed to get into a law school.  You must take the LSAT and law schools look for around an average score of 155 or higher.  Other requirements to get into law schools will vary so you will have to do some research into their admissions process.  Also, some law schools only accept in admissions in the fall so you may need to wait apply to schools that accept applications in the spring or wait until next fall.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|pRxzPiSbaa	Penn State has an online criminal justice degree that you could start with. good luck!|`|IvMPh09baa	find a law school in your area. as long as you have a Bachelors degree already you just need to apply to law schools.

But, the military commanders at the time did not have a clue as to how to deal with the enemy within. It was beyond their experience and way beyond their expertise. And unfortunately, Bush didn't recognize that fact until he was forced too.
9658d7060b703339bbfe4a795b46b04daa	I think a convicted murderer should be treated like any convicted murdered, child or not. A 16-year old knows the difference between right and wrong along with the consequences of their choices. I hate when people think juvenile murderers should get treated like babies and receive light punishment.|`|RnxxYn8gaa	The difference isn't whether or not they knew it was bad, it's the mentality where things are not as clear as it is in adulthood. The understanding is not the same.<br>  <br>  When you were 5, 6, or even 13, theft was viewed from different stages in life. Did you consider stealing in the same way you younger as you do now? Sure you knew it was wrong, maybe even as young as 4 years old if you understood the concept. Even at three we understand somewhat what it means to take something that isn't ours. Well if you paid attention to how you saw things, and how wrong or right those things truly, you can begin to realize that as you get older you begin to comprehend what is wrong more clearly. As you age you start seeing things differently.<br>  <br>  When you were young, you may not have even realized how saying malicious and hurtful things could affect someone, but when you got older you begin to see and understand how a single hurtful comment stated with a heartless reason can have the potential to affect someone more and in more ways then simple words do.<br>  <br>  At 16, and probably till about 22 or so, right and wrong become more and more clear till they hit a peak where, as a person, you begin to see them very clear. Even if there may be hazy lines drawn by society, culture, personal relationships, friends, family, and a host of other influences ranging from school to mass media, we all understand around that age give or take a couple years deep down the difference between right and wrong. Maybe not specifics, like what words are right or wrong, but deep down we know when we are wrong. We may try to cover it up psychologically, or reason how we are not wrong, we may even find scientific studies to back us, but despite our best efforts, we know right and wrong very clear by the time we reach true adulthood.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, taking all that depth into account, and realizing the reality of this, we as people find it harder to justify punishing a younger person the same as we would an adult, because deep down we know that they are not at that age of having true understanding of right and wrong yet. We know the person doesn't see what they did in the same light as they will in a few years from now. However, by 16, regardless, you know that murder is absolutely wrong, you may have doubts about illegal substances or whether you can look at a 12 year old with lust, and you may not truly see murder as you will in another few years, but come on, it's obvious.|`|eb4134143bcb36114275325ce8dffe26aa	Answer me this...can a 16 year old drink alcohol or smoke tobacco?  Can they join the military?  Can they get married without the permission of their parents or a judge?  Can they move out of home without a judge's permission (emancipation)? <br>  <br>  No...why not?  Because they are not considered mature enough to make these relatively simple decisions.  And if a juvenile (minor) is not considered mature enough to decide whether or not to drink alcohol or smoke, which are relatively minor matters, why would you consider them mature enough to be punished as adults?<br>  <br>  Only when a person is considered by law to be "mature enough" for adult privileges should they then be considered "mature enough" for an adult punishment, otherwise, the judicial system would be unbalanced and unfair!<br>  <br>  Now as to what happens in real life...too many people believe that children should be locked up for the rest of their life for committing adult crimes when the minor was too immature to fully appreciate the nature of the crime.  And the consequence is eight-year-olds being charged with murder and twelve-year-olds being sentenced to prison for the rest of their life.  Shameful!|`|y2pErbI2aa	I honestly think it should be on a case by case basis. A court-appointed psychiatrist should sit down with the suspect and ascertain whether or not they really knew what they were doing. Obviously, if they don't they should get a stint in a mental health facility. If they do understand, then they should get the chair (or needle, whatever).|`|e74a832ae61c69fd65149c1f03c178f7aa	I don't believe age has anything to do with it, it needs to be a case by case basis, unless the murder has some monetary-non emotional motive then perhaps be harsh.|`|A90SRsTxaa	A lot of times they are tried as adults when crimes are of such a heinous nature.
0NAJZKzqaa	Talk to your recruiter. As a recruit the only requirments you need to meet are mostly medical which they will figure out at MEPS. Things like asthma, seizures, migranes, etc. don't even bother. And they DO accept GED's. If fact they even have a program called GED Plus which I'm not sure what its about but I got in with a GED and they didn't care. Just talk to your recruiter and he'll square you away.|`|9j2VKjJ0aa	it harder to get out. call a recruiter, they be on your *** like a fat kid on cake.|`|0LQ5CuL0aa	it is easy just need a high school education.|`|KYGGglowaa	Well, I do know the National Guard raised their ASVAB minium score to 50....enless they changed the 50 back down to 31. I was going to go in the National Guard a while back. But you just need a diploma, u have to a make a certain weight( which the military goes by your height and age), you have to pass the ASVAB. And if you have a GED, the military will sometimes take that too. I know that the Army stopped taking the GED cause their enlistment is getting better. Thats a chance for the military to get better quality of recurits, if they raise some requirments. But talk with you local recuriter.
3tg9iXJIaa	Your are probably out of luck, I served in the AF and was diagnosed with Acid Reflux. I tried to re-enlist in the Army and was disqualified for the condition. BUT they be ways around it, I would get paper from my doctor, NOT AN OPTION, and plead my case to your local recruiter. Because if you can prove it will not affect your ability to perform, it might not hinder you, I have heard of people getting in with a heart cond. but it will depend on what kind of heart cond. I would also talk to the Navy and the Air Force Recruiters. Just dont give up. You might have to get waivers signed to do it but it will be well worth it. Good Luck.|`|dp0cffjSaa	Listen, medical conditions, even if minor, are a touchy business when trying to join the Armed Forces. Some people can get a waiver for a medical condition. Others become temporarily or permanently disqualified. It depends on the severity, the recruiter, the recruiting station's commander, your fitness, and your medical records. Each case is different. <br>  <br>  Being completely honest, however, there is a large chance that your medical condition will get you disqualified. Being even more honest, if I were a recruiter, I would disqualify you. When soldiers are out in the battlefield, no one will have any time to check on you and your heart when everyone is being shot at. <br>  <br>  The only way to find out is to go and speak to a recruiter about it.<br>  Good luck to you, hope this has helped.|`|rd0fRaWiaa	George Bush got into the National Guard despite his disability. I don't see why they won't let you in too. Just stay away from the Peace Corps or Americorps. They don't serve the nation, they only help people in need instead.|`|bczK3dXzaa	haha lie.<br>  <br>  your recruiter will tell you to do the same.|`|AA11540967	You will not be able to go in. One must be in top shape.|`|tZqi3hwwaa	Well I guess if the doctor said it shouldnt inhibit you then you should be fine.

GL240ih0aa	Are you kidding? you and i both know that you cannot "actually" investigate the bankers, they own the government through the Federal Reserve. You know the golden rule..... he who has the gold makes the rules. Any investigation upon them would show them to be the greatest criminals of all time, but you cant find a single person brave enough to actually do anything about it. I'm sure they were able to bribe or threaten this guy and then that's that. Sad yes, but true.
3caq6SFxaa	For the provide the link group-it has been reported by all the news even on the internet and yes he did say it; try looking up some thing.  Care to give me a link on Palin saying she didn't know Arica was a continent?  She didn't and the paper retracted it; I can see Russia from my house-She didn't Saturday night Live skit.  Yes he probably is spitting nails, talking to the Taliban is much different then with the Sunni groups in Iraq, the Sunni's were not followers of AQ but rather fighting with them based on tribal politics and are Muslim where AQ is really politcal..  The Taliban is religious based and the moderates have little power if you could find them-more whistling in the dark.  Yes the North Vietnamese don't really want to conquer South Vietnam and will not invade since they signed a treaty...wrong.|`|oSHCPmiqaa	why didnt you include the link? are you trying to start dissention against Obama?

Cause just like Bush said we are just going to be in and out of Iraq back in 2003 but look at us now, We still there 6 years later. Obama is saying the same thing about Afghanistan " We are just going in and out". Well I think its just a bunch of bullshit when he was promising on bring our boys home. I think our troops call Afghanistan home. But whatever people believe Obama is the change we need. The only change I'm seeing is that my husband just got back from deployment and he is already getting ready to redeploy in August again. Obama is just like all them. He lie to all as military families getting our hopes up on finally bring our troops home.|`|OwlZ1Z1Yaa	because he is a liberal with no back bone who negotiates with terrorists|`|be8558170517e11de3a13500ca72ff48aa	If you're gonna be a troll, at least learn how to spell.

yQ0OzEbZaa	These guys in the media keep telling us how impartial and unbiased they are. I don’t recall any of them ever saying anything nice about Bush, certainly didn’t say anything nice about Reagan until he died. As I’ve said before, I intend to treat the messiah-in-chief with the same exact respect and courtesy that they gave Bush. What makes things funnier and more out of whack still is that since obummer took office, the stock market has tanked, continues to tank, and as long as they keep passing these pork bills from hell, it can only get worse, yet the accolades on the “most beautiful and annointed couple in the history of man” continue at full strength. These guys really don’t understand how much they’ve damaged themselves…they’ve lost any semblance of credibility or respect. o_O|`|lHDff8Braa	Did you even read the article?  None of those candidates withdrew because of their "background":<br>  <br>  Nazareth withdrew because she "faced criticism for her SEC role in creating what Mr Obama himself has lambasted as lax oversight of the banking industry.  Gupta withdrew for family reasons, and Zinni quote-unquote withdrew because someone else got the job and no one told him.<br>  <br>  None of those candidates had any skeletons that forced them to withdraw.  It was for *other* reasons, so naturally, it's not NEWS.<br>  <br>  Next time, read your source before you try to create a scandal.|`|84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	The media is paying for their lunacy.  They are losing credibility and if you will notice, they are having less and less subscriptions to newspapers and losing their business for not being unbiased.<br>  <br>  Obama is worse than Jimmy Carter and Carter was terrible.  At the end of Carter's administration, we had 22% interest rates, gas shortages, and the real start of terrorism.  It would seem that the world would learn that you cannot negotiate with terrorists or governments that are set on destroying our way of life for their ideas on how the world should be.<br>  <br>  Obama is systematically dismantling capitalism under the disguise of making changes.  The corruption in his administration far out weighs anything I've seen to date.  Hilary was sent to China to beg and who knows if she succeeded.  We are becoming the laughing stock of foreign governments and terrorists states are looking forward to meeting with Obama.  Carter showed us what can happen when you do this and Obama is way over his head.  The only thing he knows how to do is spend other people's money and give well rehearsed speeches.|`|n5wvy5FYaa	The American media died many years ago.

The main stream press spent so much time, effort and reputation to tell the truth this early on. The majority of the talking heads were so blatant in their gushing over Obama as they all jumped on the bandwagon as the messiah's train rolled down the tracks, I think that they have buyers remorse, but they are too proud to admit that he fooled them. <br>  This will change in the near future, and I think that for all the reasons that they are covering for him now, the vitriol that they hit him with when that time comes will be staggering. <br>  I think that Obama's reaction to negative press as it spreads across the country, will be th most underhanded and nasty reaction that we have seen in a long time. His handlers will lash out and will try to ruin anybody that finally anounces that the messiah has no clothes. The calls of racism will surely follow as he fights to regain the loyaty of those that have followed his marching orders.|`|kqLdwe3Iaa	It is because most news companies like CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS are liberals and supporters of Obama and they don't wan't to make obama look like he makes bad choices. FOX news is the only conservative news company and they are the only ones to question obama.|`|FUL3Ez2Iaa	They worked so hard to get their golden boy elected, they are not about to bring out the negative.

UAMtRFruaa	Obviously not.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	They just keep coming back for more and more money.

The people have spoken By what they choose to drive.The auto industry has gouged us to death with money for their employees and those workers are ungrateful and just keep asking for more,as in the price of the car hits the buyer,they have out priced themselves in a free market.|`|xasAaGFaaa	bush did the same thing last september. he bailed out companies and gave 700 billion to CEOs and stuff, and that didnt do jack. bailing out isnt the best thing to do, you let the company die, which is actually better for the economy. things will replace the dying company|`|i5F2jwvhaa	No it wasnt<br>  <br>  Until they stop overpaying underskilled workers they do not deserve a dime|`|1oxBCtmZaa	They could have filed Ch 11 like the steel companies.|`|FaB2v37Aaa	Well your teacher sounds like an idiot.  There are many problems with the Auto industry.  The main problem is the Union.  You see cutting half of the workers does nothing because you have to pay each of them hundreds of thousands of dollars in severance pay thanks to the Union.  Their other problem is that they got complacent and tried to live on the "buy American" philosophy for too long.  They did not change with the generation and therefore they are going broke now because people are buying quality not American.  So it is either let them go under, or bail them out and save the industry and some of the jobs.  I think it's horrible to hand out money to these crooks, but it's a means to an end.  I don't want to have to speak Chinese or Japanese in the next 20 years.|`|g3Yabux2aa	No the bailout was not a good idea, no bailouts are because they socialize loss. If barry really wanted to help the US auto companies(along with many other US companies) he would press for reciprocal trade laws to level the playing field with all the nationalistic countries that have 100% import tariffs.|`|M4NbghAtaa	I was for bailing out auto companies. I'm from Michigan right in the heart of ford country. The fact of the matter is GM and Chrysler need to fail. Its crappy for Michigan being that the union workers dumped a boatload of money into our economy. At the same time were funding a slumping industry that has way too much workforce for the amount of cars being produced.|`|AA12227599	Yes it was. We don't need anymore unemployed people in this country. If everyone would just do the right thing and "buy American", they wouldn't have been in a mess at all. And your teacher should be ashamed of himself for talking to children about our President like that and forcing his opinion on impressionable minds.|`|7qRFw5fjaa	Absolutely, not.  If a private company can not run itself in a productive and cost effective manor as to make a profit, then what will a government bail out do for them?  GM needs to find other ways to cut losses or even better yet, find ways to make money!  How about making a vehicle that gets great gas mileage, is eco friendly, and safe to drive, and maybe even affordable?????
qQEl7Fukaa	That's the funniest thing I've seen all day. Thank you very much!<br>  <br>  Just to make my answer legitimate; Congress has almost always raised the deficit, and this year they seem to have an insatiable craving for pork. Obama is unlikely to stand up to his own party (unless Pelosi tells him to).|`|BHBQPFzlaa	As long as the minority leader is outright opposing everything Obama proposes, he's going to have to buy republican votes with earmarks to get anything done.|`|AA11702773	I expect him to massage numbers by putting spending in off-budget bills like the stimulus bill, bailout bills, and military funding bills, then claim he has reduced the budget deficit while increasing spending and debt.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	Yes, much more so than with Bush in the White House and a Republican-led Congress in control for most of his 8 years. We saw the disastrous results of that combination, which is why Democrats are in the White House now and control both houses of Congress.|`|um87XJvmaa	If he can get Congress to work together instead of playing games, then maybe.  If they continue with their petty childish ways, no.|`|AA11313983	Their end-all answer to excess spending is to spend more money, so I don't trust them to cut their own meat.|`|0nZHAaQDaa	I trust neither as both have proven to be inept and pork minded|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	No, not unless WE elect ALL new congressmen and make sure THEY understand that we expect them to do it. Anyone willing to move to the Independent party? <br>  <br>  I don't know if Obama will stand against his own party on the pork stuff, but if he doesn't, his approval rating even amongst Democrats will plummet I would think.

This alone, will reduce the job potential to about 50%.<br>  <br>  How can anyone possibly trust a partisan congress, particularly with the very partisan and brain dead Nancy Pelosi leading the charge.  This tells me there isn't a set of stones amongst the entire lower house, excluding Pelosi's of coarse.<br>  <br>  Obama won't fight these liberal dogs one bit.

I just finished my taxes with my accountant and he informed me that the Tax Tables for the next year has not changed and I will have to let my employees know that by law I will have to start deducting 3 to 5% less from my employees paycheck. <br>  <br>  Which means there is no tax break as Mr.President said it is reduction in wit-holdings. so your actual take home pay is increased by certain percentage. You will be liable for taxes on the pay you receive, most people will see smaller refunds or a tax bill in 2009 Tax filing.<br>  <br>  I have informed all my employees that we are not going to observe this new decree for their own benefit unless they (Employees) instruct us in writing to do so.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	Thanks <br>  every time I hear another revelation about President Obama I get <br>  <br>  amazed on the Audacity of this man and the Democrats|`|YAiKlPkMaa	This isn't much help, prices are steadily rising at the store.|`|2RE9mMtMaa	The rumor I heard is that the tables for withholding will change so you get more take-home pay, but the tax tables for year end will not change.  <br>  <br>  If that's true, there is no tax cut.

I did end up marrying her dad and we have 4 other children besides her. God designed sex for a man and a woman to enjoy inside the boundaries of marriage, so to say I have had relations with my husband 5 times within our 13 year relationship would be a lie. Read the Songs of Solomon full of good stuff about SEX! I should of waited but I didn't!and you should keep your legs closed if all you want to do is have sex and abort them. Abortion is not birth control.  But since I have Jesus as my Lord and Savior, all my sins are forgiven and I have been washed clean and been made righteous again!|`|9851306172d176bf90c2970ca456d866aa	I am neither strict pro-life nor strict pro-choice.<br>  <br>  Legally, any time I have sex I am responsible for a child, no matter what.

Only someone who catches a few sound clips from the liberal camps of Rush would think he kissed up to Bush.<br>  <br>  And just for the record... Bush wasn't going to get the office again anyway.

He is doing a great job of distracting the masses and keeping them from paying attention to anything worth paying attention to.  He is just like Michael Savage, Glen Beck, Geraldo Rivera, Alan Colmes, etc.  Yeah, just a person filling a radio spot.  Seriously, the democrats can't give him the time of day.

The most common response from supporters is something like "if you make over 250K you're rich and greedy, and have no right to complain about paying a little more if it helps someone who really needs it, like me." But I wonder how often it works the other way for those in favor of confiscating the wealth of others.<br>  <br>  For millions in Third World countries poverty means death. How many of those who applaud Obama's "soak the rich" scheme give a significant portion of their incomes to the truly poor in Africa, for whom eating on a regular basis is a dream; let alone living in a home with indoor plumbing, electricity etc.<br>  <br>  Many Americans think they're struggling if they can only afford basic cable and drive a car that's 10 years old. But to a huge segment of the world population, even those living at poverty level here are unimaginably wealthy. Seen through their eyes, surely you can live without your cell phone, television and computer if it meant saving the lives of a dozen starving children.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, I think we all have a moral obligation to help the less fortunate. And I donate a significant amount to charity. But I do so voluntarily. And I understand that government must be funded through taxes...to a point. But I wonder how many of those "share the wealth" advocates would applaud a government empowered to decide which of their possessions are really necessary, and which should be confiscated for the greater good, world wide. <br>  <br>  So I wonder how many of you that want more from the wealthy practice what you preach, and give until it hurts?|`|AA10079277	Your logic is so stupid, but sadly typical.<br>  <br>  So you are struggling to pay your bills.

AA11537652	I would say it will stop falling when the market has weeded out all of the speculation that has dragged it down. I just don't see a turnaround until the beginning of 2011. There is just way too much toxic debt out there. The stock market absolutely must hit rock bottom before we can pick up the pieces and recover. A full correction is necessary. Also, you must remember that the market is only 1/3 of the total economy. Consumer spending makes up for over 2/3 of the economy. When people start spending again (won't be soon), only then can the market recover. But consumer spending relies heavily on employment. And that is the real crisis here- the job market is the worst in decades. People absolutely must have stable employment before they spend. <br>  <br>  Note: A commercial real estate crash is on the way and it could very well be worse than the consumer real estate crash.

g6fceeYraa	I absolutley do not support it. It is stupid and it takes rights away from a group of individuals. It is discrimination. If I was old enough to vote I would have voted no because it isn't right. I am straight btw. <br>  Even though prop. 8 passed I know that same sex marriages will eventually be allowed. No one has the right to take anyone elses rights away.<br>  I hate how the protectmarriage campaign used so many lies to convince people.|`|rxKvdkFyaa	Yes. I dont support it. Not because I am persecuting gay people or anything but God said for man to marry woman. Its not that im uncomfortable with them because they are just people its just I believe that traditional marriage is the way to go. I mean, just BEING gay and dating is one thing, but to have MARRIAGE legal is a pretty important change. So not to offend anyone but, I do not support gay marriages because of my faith and beliefs.|`|o2ciD6gWaa	No<br>  Why do people have to care so much about this?<br>  Why is it so hard for people to just be in peace between one another?<br>  Is it the bible? No <br>  If one actually looks to the Bible no where does it actually say flat out that gays are abominations, and even then the english version was poorly translated from the original and on that hasn't the church been wrong before? (hint: the early belief that the earth was the center of the universe) times have changed since the bible was originally written.<br>  Even then can't people see that hate for gays is the same thing as racism, it is disapproval for an entire portion of people in the world just like what happened to the jews, the africans, the mexicans. It's so simple to understand it is flat out intolerance.<br>  We are all people and until we learn to just accept new beliefs and ideas in the world we will never find peace.|`|TBvUomw7aa	NO!<br>  <br>  I don't believe that the government should be allowed to say who you can and can't married.  Marry your mom, the ocean or a goat for all I care.<br>  <br>  The reason that this passed in California is because Californians don't think before they vote.  They see, "Yes" as in, "My yes will either pass a budget for a good thing or create a law."  A many a suckers voted "yes" on that out of habit among those that were confused about what yes and no meant.  Also, various polling places were handing out cards telling you how Obama would vote.  Obama would've voted "no" on 8 according to the card that I was handed.  I wish I kept it.  I tossed it right away as I was so pissed off that they would try to pull such a thing on me and other voters.<br>  <br>  Oh, you should see the other crap that they put on the ballots.  My favourite was back in Marin--2002 or so, there was a ballot where if you voted "yes" on it, they would hike up the bridge toll for the GGB and the RCB.  If you voted "no" SUVs would be illegal and there would be no hike in toll.|`|0d9146a1d3a0724397992a1b2ed9f5cdaa	Just playing Devil's advocate here, but....<br>  <br>  Wasn't that already voted upon by the People of the State of California?<br>  <br>  For the record, I support the legal union of two consenting adults.<br>  Apparently, more voters chose to deny equal rights to everyone than chose fairness.<br>  <br>  If a man wants to marry a man, or a woman a woman, it is<br>  <br>  None.<br>  Of my.<br>  Business.<br>  <br>  And let's keep it that way.

Now, I'm going to get bashed by this, especially since you're clearly a NO on 8.  But it's partly my religion, I may not be a very good Christian, but I still try and follow our guidelines.  Marriage is and has been defined as a union before God of a Man and a Woman.  How can you go before God, who stated it is wrong and demand he recognize your union?<br>  I see nothing wrong with creating some sort of official union for gays, they deserve every legal and financial support and security a traditional married couple gets.  But I don't feel it should be termed as marriage.<br>  See, one of the stipulations of the law was that ALL CHURCHES WOULD HAVE NO RIGHT TO TURN THEM AWAY.  This is wrong.  Some churches are fine performing the ceremony, and that's just fine, but you can't force it on everyone.  It's literally against all they know, completely against their beliefs.  Had they not put in that little side not to the law, I would have voted no. <br>  I have a gay cousin in Australia, I want her to be happy.  I have gay friends and coworkers, I don't hate them for their life style.   That's completlly their thing, as long as their happy I'm fine with it!  I just don't feel that trampling all over God's word is the way to go.<br>  Best of Luck!<br>  <br>  Subcomanda, the law would have been that they had no lawful right to turn them away or deny the performance of their marriage.|`|1TCNW8lBaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Marriage= man + woman.

They certainly don't have to now, and they didn't have to when same-sex marriage was legal, between May and November of 2008. Prop. 8, which amends the constitution to define marriage exclusively as between a man and a woman, sure as *hell* won't require churches to perform gay marriage ceremonies. <br>  <br>  The only thing that the CA Supreme Court's ruling did was to require state officials to grant civil marriage licenses to gay couples. Churches were in no way obligated to do *anything* that they didn't want to. Loupa is regurgitating the false propaganda of the religious right regarding the political realities of Prop. 8, and it's a damned shame.|`|eYpE4bp2aa	Well, I live in Texas, but I would never have supported such a backward proposition.

A member of the race can only be one who is of German blood, without consideration of creed. Consequently no Jew can be a member of the race. <br>  Whoever has no citizenship is to be able to live in Germany only as a guest, and must be under the authority of legislation for foreigners. <br>  The right to determine matters concerning administration and law belongs only to the citizen. Therefore we demand that every public office, of any sort whatsoever, whether in the Reich, the county or municipality, be filled only by citizens. We combat the corrupting parliamentary economy, office-holding only according to party inclinations without consideration of character or abilities. <br>  We demand that the state be charged first with providing the opportunity for a livelihood and way of life for the citizens. If it is impossible to sustain the total population of the State, then the members of foreign nations (non-citizens) are to be expelled from the Reich. <br>  Any further immigration of non-citizens is to be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans, who have immigrated to Germany since the [2 August 1914], be forced immediately to leave the Reich. <br>  All citizens must have equal rights and obligations. <br>  The first obligation of every citizen must be to work both spiritually and physically. The activity of individuals is not to counteract the interests of the universality, but must have its result within the framework of the whole for the benefit of all Consequently we demand: <br>  Abolition of unearned (work and labour) incomes. Breaking of rent-slavery. <br>  In consideration of the monstrous sacrifice in property and blood that each war demands of the people personal enrichment through a war must be designated as a crime against the people. Therefore we demand the total confiscation of all war profits. <br>  We demand the nationalisation of all (previous) associated industries (trusts). <br>  We demand a division of profits of all heavy industries. <br>  We demand an expansion on a large scale of old age welfare. <br>  We demand the creation of a healthy middle class and its conservation, immediate communalization of the great warehouses and their being leased at low cost to small firms, the utmost consideration of all small firms in contracts with the State, county or municipality. <br>  We demand a land reform suitable to our needs, provision of a law for the free expropriation of land for the purposes of public utility, abolition of taxes on land and prevention of all speculation in land. <br>  We demand struggle without consideration against those whose activity is injurious to the general interest. Common national criminals, usurers, profiteers and so forth are to be punished with death, without consideration of confession or race. <br>  We demand substitution of a German common law in place of the Roman Law serving a materialistic world-order. <br>  The state is to be responsible for a fundamental reconstruction of our whole national education program, to enable every capable and industrious German to obtain higher education and subsequently introduction into leading positions. The plans of instruction of all educational institutions are to conform with the experiences of practical life. The comprehension of the concept of the State must be striven for by the school [Staatsbuergerkunde] as early as the beginning of understanding. We demand the education at the expense of the State of outstanding intellectually gifted children of poor parents without consideration of position or profession. <br>  The State is to care for the elevating national health by protecting the mother and child, by outlawing child-labor, by the encouragement of physical fitness, by means of the legal establishment of a gymnastic and sport obligation, by the utmost support of all organizations concerned with the physical instruction of the young. <br>  We demand abolition of the mercenary troops and formation of a national army. <br>  We demand legal opposition to known lies and their promulgation through the press. In order to enable the provision of a German press, we demand, that: a. All writers and employees of the newspapers appearing in the German language be members of the race: b. Non-German newspapers be required to have the express permission of the State to be published. They may not be printed in the German language: c. Non-Germans are forbidden by law any financial interest in German publications, or any influence on them, and as punishment for violations the closing of

The fact that it was not intentional helps, however he did hurt her. if she punched herself in the arm or he bruised her we will never really know and it is irrelevant.<br>  <br>  If she makes the claim that he is abusive and can submit evidence (such as the grabbing incident) that will work against him having full visitation.<br>  <br>  All that said, he needs a lawyer. he will not win this without one.|`|85jy4Mt0aa	What does your fiance's attorney say to these questions?

BHBQPFzlaa	your employer will be paying about the same taxes as he did during the clinton adminstration. If his business is unable to survive during the conditions that plenty thrived under from 1992-2000, then you're already in trouble, regardless of what taxes you pay.<br>  <br>  richer: I'm 14 feet tall in real life. It's true because I say so on the internet.<br>  <br>  While we're looking at history, the national debt always skyrockets whenever republicans are in control of both the white house and congress. It goes up substantially more under republican presidents than under democratic presidents.<br>  <br>  Mark: If he needs to fire people because of an incremental tax increase, his profit margin must be lower than that tax increase, or he doesn't know how to run his business. There are two possible situations:<br>  1) He's doing well enough to keep all his capital and employees for the duration of the economic downturn. It's much cheaper to keep it all, as you avoid the cost of paying severance, finding new employees when things are better, reducing production rate and then increasing it when things are better, etc...<br>  2) He's not doing well enough to keep all his employees and capital for the duration of the economic downturn (tax increase included). This mean his profit is less than the tax differential, in which case you should have been looking for another job already.<br>  <br>  Just because he had the benefit of having lower taxes than under Clinton for the past 8 years, doesn't mean that it's a catastrophe when he no longer gets that extra money.<br>  <br>  Mark: I don't know where you're getting the facts. Here are some national debt figures with sources:<br>  2000: $5.5 Trillion<br>  2008: $11 Trillion<br>  2009: $11 Trillion + money allocated for stimulus (not yet spent = not paying interest yet)<br>  For obama to have tripled our national debt, he would have had to spend $22 trillion. Do you think this is accurate?<br>  <br>  Perhaps you mean our DEFICIT, the difference between our government's spending an revenue (when we spend less than we take in, it's a surplus). Bush's deficit in 2008 was $1.081 Trillion. Obama would have had to spend $2.162 trillion + everything he took in from taxes to triple our deficit. Do you think this is true?<br>  <br>  By your logic, when costs go down, businesses hire more people. This is clearly not true. Really, when demand increases, the need for production increases and companies choose to invest in more capital and personnel. When costs go down and demand is steady, profit increases.<br>  <br>  Cutting jobs is cutting production, which decreases revenue. If this is NOT true, it means that your job does not add to the production of your company. You should be fired anyway.<br>  <br>  You can't simply multiply today's cost by 10 and arrive at $24 trillion. This leaves out important factors like the time value of money, and probably doesn't take into account taxes collected during those years. It makes a big difference if the economy is doing well, as more sales/income taxes are collected, and less benefits are paid out. My guess is that you either have no source for this number, or it's someone who oversimplified to the point of total inaccuracy.<br>  <br>  I cited my source for bush's $1.081 trillion 2008 deficit. Where's yours saying it's only $500 billion. Maybe you know something the US Treasury doesn't know?<br>  <br>  Let's agree right now that I don't regard anything hannity says as fact, and you don't have to regard anything michael moore says as fact. <br>  <br>  One thing you're not seeing in the senate documents is the cost of the war.

He told me his taxes were going up maybe $20,000 a year.   No big deal for him,  He even said so. We are just going back to the Clinton years when we actually had a SURPLUS.  My Client couldn't be happier with all the for-closers around.  He is picking up cheep houses left and right.  Poor over taxed rich people.  Give me a break.  As for the national debt it is the Republicans fault.<br>  <br>  <br>  My we have an angry little Republican.   I would like you to consider this $20,000 my client will have to pay extra in taxes.  What if maybe it meant 5 of my neighbors(  I live in a modest neighborhood) spent 4,000 less on their health care.  What if it meant their employers cost for health care went down as well.  Perhaps my neighbors may be able to remodel their bathroom with this money, or go on vacation, or eat out once a week or send their kid to community college.  Wouldn't that stimulate the economy and create jobs.  I think it would.  If you walked up to your boss right now and asked him what his biggest expense is he will most likely say health care costs.  That is our biggest problem.  It keeps me from hiring permanent workers.  My family paid 14,000 $ last year for health care.  Over 20% of our income.  I would be more than happy for Obama to raise my taxes 5% if it meant Universal health care.

xxDjV6Axaa	It depends on your state laws.  You might be able to recover the amount if you had to take off from work.  But you can't recover just for the time spent.  If you don't work, or didn't have to take off, or you get paid to take the day off, then you can't get recover that cost.  You might get court costs if that is allowable.  Depending on your case and your state, you might get punitive damages.|`|7uznrLBXaa	No.  The goal is to make you whole - not to let you profit.

3caq6SFxaa	Living in California means that oldmarine08 is correct-it is illegal for you to own an automatic weapon or make a new purchase of one.  The rest would be correct with exceptions of living in a few other places that have outlawed new ownership.  You apply for a Class Three permit and have to pay a tax and for a background check through the FBI for each weapon or Class 3 item (Silencers mainly) and the total between the two usually runs about $400.00 plus the cost of the item.|`|JDAbWnJraa	You don't get a Class III license unless you are a dealer. You want an automatic firearm, you need to purchase a federal tax stamp with each automatic firearm you purchase. These only cost $250.00, last one I bought, but they may be a bit more/less at the moment. Just get ready to have the BATF rolled up tight in your rectum all so that you can say you have an automatic pee shooter.|`|zejFr1Ciaa	It's a Class Three Federal Firearms license and has to be applied for thru the Dept Of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms.

7BJ0YScwaa	The United States as a country prone to political violence and assassination. Nine American Presidents - Andrew Jackson in 1835, Abraham Lincoln in 1865, James Garfield in 1881, William McKinley in 1901 Harry S. Truman in 1950, John F. Kennedy in 1963, Richard Nixon in 1974, Gerald Ford twice in 1975, and Ronald Reagan in 1981 - have been the targets of assassination. Attempts have also been made on the lives of one President-elect (Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933) and three Presidential candidates (Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, and George Wallace in 1972). In addition, eight governors, seven U.S. Senators, nine U.S. Congressmen, eleven mayors, 17 state legislators, and eleven judges have been violently attacked. No other country with a population of over 50 million has had as high a number of political assassinations or attempted assassinations.<br>  <br>  That's not to mention all the foreign politicians the US assasinates.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oscar. What was his crime? The US put him in power, spent billions on shipping him free weapons to fund the Iran Iraq war (until they had the 4rth largest army) so the US could test thier weapons against Russian weapons in live fire conditions. The US treats those people like they are lower than dogs, pushes them into to constant war, assasinates and manipulates thier leaders and then when someone finally fights back against the US you call him crazy and make up more lies to justify yourself. The US deserves punishement.  You are an idiot.|`|AnHQbZQAaa	In which country?<br>  <br>  Saddam went on trial first. Bogus trial or not, it's not an assassination if you can see it coming for weeks beforehand.|`|Rfh0N5Vvaa	Sometimes when those elected forget they work for the people and not the other way around, they sometimes have to be forced back on the right path. Not saying its right mind you, but sometimes it gets so far out of hand that nothin else will do it. <br>  <br>  Sadam was sentenced to hang and got his just reward.|`|1CgK5Le6aa	As George Carlin pointed out, we tend to kill those who tell us to live in peace and harmony (Jesus, MLK, Kennedy, Lincoln...), and I think this country's multiculturalism promotes that perspective.<br>  <br>  As for why Saddam isn't on the list, I don't remember the exact name, but Reagan issued an order against assassinating foreign heads of state. This is good policy, and like all good policy, there are ugly consequences. But we must hold ourselves to the highest standards if we wish to be a force of good in the world.

That's a subjective term and can only be determined between two or more consenting individuals.  Without a doubt, there would be no consensus on the matter.  I think though that people should be allowed to associate however they wish.  That includes employment.<br>  <br>  I can see a tit for tat that you are suggesting.  It may be inferred that Obama supporters are hostile to the interests of the wealthiest (who, as you note, often are employers).  It would be understandable for a person to terminate the employment of a employee that he believed to be hostile to his interests.<br>  <br>  This class distinction is most evident in politics.  Obama supporters sense that the wealth enjoyed by the upper 5% is unfair and so want to soak them.  This is understandable if ill conceived because on the other side, the richest 5% are often guilty (though not all of them) of obtaining unfair advantages through lobbying and other influence.  Not surprisingly, wealth tends to win.<br>  <br>  So we could continue this tit for tat and call it fair.  The vast majority of us who are not in the influential classes should realize that we are not going to come out ahead in this exchange.  Alternatively, we could reject class divisions.  Do not seek to empower government to either provide privilege or to tear it down.  Then we may hope that employment and all associations will be based more upon individual choices than class identification.|`|eUdBD4tPaa	Well, laying off people because you don't like their opinion is probably not nice, but it's not taking away their freedom of speech.  The thing we seem to forget in this nation is consequences.  Just because I have the right to say something doesn't always make it wise for me to say it.  There are consequences to our actions and if a private owner decides to layoff people for what ever reason he chooses, that is his right to do so too.|`|3YRrGfkiaa	And why would they do this?

There are three basic types of people:<br>  <br>  1. Invitees: Generally business visitors<br>  -Can only be sued if harm is sustained within scope of invite<br>  -Ex: You have a customer slip and fall in the back room marked "employees only," there's no liability because they were outside the scope of their invitation.<br>  <br>  2. Licensees: Social visitors<br>  -You only have to warn them of dangers you know about<br>  -Ex: You have a BBQ and know there's a hole in your yard, there would be liability if you failed to warn the BBQ guests of the hole.<br>  <br>  3. Trespassers: Trespassers<br>  -You have no duty to warn<br>  -Ex: Same hole in the yard as the BBQ example above, you don't have to warn a burglar of that hole and you can't be sued if he falls into it (unless it is an attractive nuisance, like a swimming pool).<br>  <br>  So no, you don't have to leave a light on for burglars.

Obama (needs to be impeached NOW!) is so inexperience he is like having a 10 year old do brain surgery or a monkey working on your car braking system probably do a better job than Obama (needs to be impeached NOW!) too.  Obama (needs to be impeached NOW!) only cares about himself and nobody else, all he thinks about is what is in it for him, he got his spendulus package so that he can pay off his debt to those who got him in office, he is letting terrorist go to pay back the muslim countries that gave him over $50 million for his campaign and now he is all buddy buddy with them claim they are now our friends, try selling that to the 9/11 victims and survivors.  Hillery is just another reminder of how inexperienced Obama (needs to be impeached NOW!) really is!|`|n5wvy5FYaa	They couldn't help themselves, that's who they are.

They are gracious and polite.    Of course, I would think Obama would have people in his staff to rely on  for etiquette.   As for Clinton, Diplomacy is not her strong suit, and has insulted Putin in the past.   Her behavior toward The Russian President is unfortunately actually expected.   I Was actually thinking about how bad Clinton is  at Diplomacy, becasue today is international woman's day and I passed by a protest in Westwood.  It reminded me on how badly she insulted China and the Muslim world during the Beijing woman's conference.   Of course I had a fit when I found out Hillary was going to be Secretary of state and realize, Obama would do alot of damage in the area of international relationship.
HBJJQ2MMaa	SatCom is a great job to have in the Air Force, The training demands can be difficult but its a very good career to go into. The steps are gonna be basic, then tech school, (which again is demanding academically if you don't have electronics experience), then an assignment to your first duty station. The type of work you do day to day can vary widely depending on what type of equipment your unit has and the type of mission they perform. If your in a Combat Communications unit (which many of us are) you will likely experience more field training, and work on smaller antenna's designed to deploy, while at another unit you could be maintaing very large antenna systems. <br>    You never stop learning in this career field and as you get more experienced as a technician you pass on your knowledge by training the next Airmen coming into the field.  <br>   As far as civilian jobs go there is a better chance of getting a great civilian equivalent if you complete your CCAF (Community College of the Air Force) degree and better even if you get your electronics engineering bachelors degree. Once you complete Tech school you should have only general education requirements ( for your CCAF) and you can finish most if not all of those through CLEP tests. <br>     The best resource I could mention for  learning more about this job is to go to 2E1X1.com and talk with other people that are in Satcom. Also they have info on the training you'll do at tech school. <br>     The biggest favor you can do yourself coming into this job as with anything in the Air Force is to have a positive attitude and keep being proactive. Asking questions like this one to learn more and prepare yourself shows you're at least interested in it and want to do well and that will help when you get in. <br>     Again this is a great job, and if you want to find a high paying civilian job after serving then start knocking out school ASAP,  after you graduate from Ft. Gordon.|`|wihUt1lzaa	Follow Up Question:  My son is thinking about signing up for this AFSC, but the forum:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://2e1x1.com/" rel="nofollow">http://2e1x1.com/</a><br>  <br>  Doesn't look like a forum that is open to the public?

They maintain satellite comm. for the air force and especial circuits.  I am a 2E6X3, which is a voice network systems.  We work with SATCOM guys if we wanted to shoot out signal to a remote area, where copper or fiber optic is impossible to run.  SATCOM has a regular duty hours, but they are like us, they have a stand-by personnel that is on-call for a week.  The standby rotates every week, depending on how the shop is ran.  SATCOM is a good job, and it pays alot when you go civilian.  Good luck!
gZr0cwxmaa	I have yet to find a good point about it. The worst is the lack of choices.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I love using the public library. I have my own library at home but sometimes I don't want to buy a book but use it & bring it back. I would prefer that we didn't pay so much for some people to make a huge check costing us all more money to pay their check. Like we have to have auto insurance in my state. I used to work for an agency where the owner made a ton of money & is complaining about paying taxes when he won't miss that money. We could all pay less if we didn't have to pay his ridiculous paycheck. It is not healthy to be that greedy & materialistic. No,one I know wants to put out people who want to have their own businesses.

The argument that we have socialist programs in place, while a valid one, does not justify allowing the government to expand to the point that it reaches into every corner of our lives. The idea of "collectivism" over "individualism" is a flawed one. Why? Because YOU no longer make the choice what is good for you. Someone else does. Plus, look at the redistribution model. Does it occur to anyone that once the rich (and middle class and business owners) are taxed to the point that they have to hold on to what little they have, they cease to exist, or they move because the cost of doing business is simply too high and not profitable--who is the next tier to start paying? This goes on until the tax rate is outrageously out of control and there is no longer incentive to be in business. The cost also affects innovation. Punishing the innovators results in less progress.|`|jLxBvXZ5aa	People thought in the beginning that the idea of socialism was optimistic and well-intentioned. They believed that under socialism...there will be no people living in fetid dens and fetid rags, and bringing up unhealthy, hunger-pinched children in the midst of impossible and absolutely repulsive surroundings.  Each member of the society will share in the general prosperity and happiness of the society, and if a frost comes no one will be practically be anything worse...<br>  <br>  The old socialist hope was a mass prosperity that would free all people from the burden of laboring for others and place them in a position to pursue higher ends, such as art and philosophy, in a conflict free society.  The problem was the Marxist prediction of a revolution that would bring about this good society rested on the assumption that the condition of the working classes would grow ever worse under capitalism.<br>  <br>  However, in the early 20th century it was clear that this assumption was completely wrong.  Indeed, the reverse was occurring: As wealth grew through capitalist means, the standard of living for all was improving.<br>  <br>  Look at welfare today and you will note it is socialism that enslaves, and capitalism frees people.<br>  <br>  Carmen<br>  .|`|bqJgdcfLaa	The people who say there is nothing good about socialism aren't even taking your question seriously.  There are a lot of social democratic countries in the world, and a lot of them are arguably doing better than we are.<br>  <br>  Best:  We each get a fairer share.  Everybody should get healthcare, a decent retirement, education.  No one should starve.<br>  <br>  Worst:  If done improperly stifles innovation.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	There is more good than bad. The good side means more equality among the population and when someone fails financially they aren't buried for ever under the burden of eternal debt and the so called free markets we have never have had and never will have. Education is much more obtainable, we have roads that aren't like driving in bomb craters, we have a strong defense, we have available and affordable health care and so on.<br>  The down side is that if it's a one party system it turns into communism. Since we don't have a single party system socialism does indeed work fairly well. We have opposition parties to keep power in check to keep THE party from completely taking over every persons lives.|`|f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	Well if that's your ideas of SOCIALISM let me say it's worked WONDERFULLY for us Canadians for many, many decades and then some.<br>  <br>  Well Track I must say I actually agree with you there and the problem with that is WHAT?<br>  <br>  You can choose to better yourself or  you can remain dumb...at least you have the choice (and a job too!!!)<br>  <br>  The alternative is you can be a lazy a.s.s. and contract it all out to CHINA so you can shop at the dollar store then whine when America falls to pieces...whoops...too late.|`|fHTvjaYtaa	I read all of your responses......To all the people that thought Socialism was a good thing....Hence...hands down....I wonder how many are on Public assistance, Food Stamps....never worked, saved for their families when they were working.....or, perhaps purchased things they could not afford....like houses, cars, credit card shopping, etc.  I want to work for MY money....If I work and have to give it to those who do not work....then I will sit home and draw off the government also!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|zNB3tZXraa	Best thing=nothing.

They did an excellent job in rebuilding Europe after the war. <br>  Most people in north America can not tell the difference between socialism and communism.

Communism demands that means of production are a state property.<br>  Good thing - Socialism proper can provide higher standards of leaving for most of the population.<br>  Bad thing - Many people can only be happy if others are miserable.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	I am hard pressed to think of anything positive about it.  Perhaps you could say it creates a lot of jobs for bureaucrats?  <br>  <br>  Socialism is all about putting the needs of the Collective ahead of the needs of the individual.

t3QAaSN9aa	Great question.  I wouldn't even have a chance to be critical of President Obama here on Yahoo Answers because I spend all of my time here countering ridiculously stupid Republican criticisms.  Republican extremism is helping to unite the Democrats.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	I think we are being critical of the things that we disagree with. Republican hysteria is the reason more and more moderates are moving away from the GOP.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	Yes, the Republicans see the gravy train of borrow and spend deficits ending.  They are panic stricken, not that Obama might fail, but that he might succeed.  <br>  <br>  The neocons and their lies and deceit are on the ropes.  Here is hoping Obama quickly gets the deficits under control and relegates the neocon trash to the scrapheap of history.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	What "hysteria"?<br>  <br>  And I've never seen a leftist criticize their own, unless they did something unforgivable like support the war on terror like Joe Lieberman did. <br>  <br>  I was almost shocked when Byrd criticized Obama, but then I remembered that Byrd is KKK.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	The Republicans have nothing to do with it. The Democrats have their idol in office now, they're happy.|`|JO8YzDNVaa	I don't think there is any<br>  <br>  Reason<br>  <br>  behind the Republican Hysteria.|`|bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	I believe that's a possibility but that doesn't make it any better. War, torture and all the other things where Obama deserves criticism are not small issues. Not criticizing your own leader over atrocities like that is wrong whatever the excuse is.<br>  <br>  Furthermore those liberals who called Bush a war criminal, Hitler even, but now let Obama get away unchallenged with similar policies can't expect me to ever take them serious again.<br>  They have shown themselves to be hypocrites deserving no more respect than the diehard Bush supporters and the case can be made they actually deserve less. Because as far as those Bush supporters might be of me at least they show consistency where those liberals just used and agreed to terms they didn't understand nor respect. Bottom line would probably violate some guidelines|`|AA10079277	So what you're admitting is that Democrats are not being more critical of Obama when they should be, and the reson is because the Republicans are hysterical.  <br>  <br>  This is the second time you've implied the Democrats are so stupid that they cannot do what is right because they are so easily distracted.|`|c3vPZfghaa	It took right-wingers 8 years before they blamed Bush for anything.... Oooops I mean 8 years and 2 months.... oh wait a minute, we'll have to put that blame on hold a little longer, they are still blaming Clinton..... Oh wait a minute, they skipped completely over blaming Bush and started blaming Obama.<br>  <br>  Bush got 8 years of no blame and Obama can't even get 8 weeks?<br>  heck Bush got 9 months and wasn't blamed for 9/11!|`|IjYTf3wyaa	Partly - but also in part because right now, with the head of steam Obama has passing every money spending proposition he can put his hands on, it would be like stepping in front of a fully loaded freight train.

Most of the left thinking people are the touchy feely sort, the right are more logical thinkers (for the most part).|`|6AgnCKCPaa	No because there is no Republican "hysteria" only liberal adoration.

There are many issues where Obama has to rally his own people and if you listen to some so called ‘left liberal talk radio’, there are many hosts and callers for whom he is still not left wing enough. I keep hearing things like: A man right from the middle and not left, a wall-street guy, not really black, etc. And after all the expectations that people have of him all over the world, he now has to deliver a miracle.<br>  <br>  Why should the Democrats be more critical of Obama? For the first time they see that when Democrats stand together they can actually win and move an agenda through. They actually get the idea that party leadership comes from unity and as of recent they had not much experience with that kind of power. In order to get anything accomplished, the Democratic Party had to move so far to the right were at one point they were almost indistinguishable from the GOP. Obama’s leadership put an end to that as we can see in the strong polarization of both parties as of recent. It may not be bi-partisan as promised, but why should he make compromises when he is entrusted with saving the nation from economic collapse. Would you?<br>  <br>  Unity never was a GOP problem, not since Reagan. People who fell out of party line were punished immediately. That practice still prevails as the threats they issued to the three Senators who voted for Obama's stimulus beginning of February clearly demonstrated. Republicans and the GOP are extremely result oriented and they have shown over and over that it does not matter to them what values have to be sacrificed in order to meet whatever momentary priority was on the agenda. That's why nobody criticized Bush during his term, only when it was convenient to blame him a little bit because his approval ratings were down and the next candidate had to be somehow lifted into the Oval Office.<br>  <br>  The democrats are experiencing the value of power through unity, and the GOP gets a good dose of their own medicine. The leadership is in absolute disarray and they cannot redefine themselves. Being one of the secondary priorities for too long conservative values have been tossed overboard a long time ago. There is no more rabbit in the hat other than opposition to everything Obama proposes, especially if it is related to taxes. <br>  There will be a lot written about Limbaugh’s speech, but when he says he wants Obama to fail, doesn’t he say that he does not want the economy to get any better and he does not care that more people lose their homes, their jobs and their way of live. Further he does not want the country to be energy independent, which means that he wants the US to be even more dependent on foreign oil, more involved in foreign wars and longer imbedded in the war in Iraq, which keep killing a lot of American Service men and women and Iraqis and takes resources away from the war against Bin Laden. Doesn't that actually mean that he actually wants Al Qaeda to succeed, possibly even with another terror strike against the US? Doesn’t that very much sound like he is asking for another term under the Bush administration and only because his income is in the ‘above 250k tax bracket’? It tells you enough about Limbaugh and how self involved he really is. If that is what the Republican agenda is all about, I find them extremely unpatriotic, in fact I think its high treason. It is very sad, but currently the Republican Party does not have any leadership in or any clue on how to solve the current crisis, and the Democrats have the initiative. Time will tell if they are right, but for now, I'd rather go with them, at least they have a plan. All that the Republican Party will do is what they have been doing since the election: Just say no!|`|N5pPJUS8aa	It's astounding to watch the avalanche of hate ooze from conservative media quarters. And why? Because Obama passed an economic recovery bill. Good Lord, imagine if he had failed to win the popular vote and then led the country into a pre-emptive war based on faulty intelligence, a war that lost thousands of American lives, and tens of thousands of foreign lives, while milking the U.S. treasury out of a few trillion dollars in the process.|`|98EXXItdaa	No.  Democrats simply lack any experience in independant thought, it's hard for them to just start thinking for themselves when they've never done it before.<br>  <br>  Thus, Obama can do idiotic things.. and the Obamabots will mindlessly chant "yes we can!"|`|5rL4njnxaa	I like most of what Obama is doing.<br>  <br>  Republican hysteria is quite entertaining.

If you want to learn more about what a medic does in the Army you can simply google: MOS 68W<br>  Although 17 is the age you can join with parental permission it really comes down to how mature you feel and if you are up for the challenge.  You will definitely mature while at training and its an exhilarating experience.  I joined as a medic when i was 18 and loved the training.  It was very tough but definitely worth it.  Good luck!|`|dp0cffjSaa	The age requirements for the Army are that you cannot be younger than 17 years of age at the time of enlistment and that you cannot be older than 41 years of age at the time of enlistment. 17-41 years old are the acceptable ages for those wishing to join the U.S. Army. However, at 17, since you do not yet have legal emancipation from your parents or guardians, they must give consent before you can enlist. Be sure to discuss it with them!

(DNA evidence is not available in most murder cases)<br>  <br>  - It costs taxpayers MUCH more to execute someone than to imprison them for life.<br>  <br>  - Violent crime rates are HIGHER in death penalty jurisdictions.<br>  <br>  - It is inconsistently and arbitrarily applied.<br>  <br>  - Jesus was against it (see Matthew 5:7 & 5:38-39, James 4:12, Romans 12:17-21, and John 8:7).|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	Painful death penalty|`|fSlZQzS4aa	The death penalty is so unused that it has become about as close to meaningless as it can get short of abolition.  There were only 37 executions in 2008.  The most there has been in the last 100 years is 198 in 1935. Statistically, that is zero.|`|KpcjvUgwaa	We need to stop looking at the whole process from the "penalty" point of view. Who cares what the best punishment for crimininals is.<br>  <br>  Just kill all the criminals, and get them off the planet....it will save millions of taxpayer money.<br>  <br>  Murder, Rape, Drunk Driving, ID Theft, Corporate Embezzlement, Selling Drugs, Assault with a weapon, writing computer viruses.<br>  <br>  If all of those crimes resulted in Death...You would see very few of those crimes committed. <br>  <br>  So you have to ask yourself....do you want to continue trying to figure out the perfect balance of what is "just and fair punisment"...which is what we've been doing for 200 years and it is 100% ineffective.<br>  <br>  or do you want those crimes to actually go away?....if you want the crimes to go away..then we have to change our approach.<br>  <br>  <br>  ...I suggest...death to all criminals  (shrug)|`|7RbootLlaa	I oppose the death penalty. Many reasons: 1). An innocent person can be put to death and has happened. 2). Drink drivers that kill people are excempt, which is unfair. 3). When you die, that's it. No pain, no suffering, no remorse. 4). People who have a lot of money and murder, can buy their way out. Well ... can hire expensive lawyers etc, while people from a lower class can't even do that. So the way the law is, only poor people are put to death and not the rich. Again unfair. 5). Go into your toilet and think how you would feel locked in there for 20 years - that's jail for you. 6). Judges do say an eye for an eye, but when it's one of their relatives. It's completely different. Point number 2 example:  Eugene McGee from South Australia - high flying lawyer, drunken driver, kills a cyclist and drives away without stopping or calling for help. The police delibrately charged him with a minor offence and he did no jail time. AND he was smiling about it too. It's people like the police and him that disgust me. Other people get the book thrown at them.<br>  <br>  That's some of my thoughts.|`|f5CsZYcDaa	it is if they like killed someone sure. i think it is the best punishment.|`|bYxkUDmoaa	Ablolutly!

Why don't we as a Government say OK enough is enough we need jobs and if you (Company) send jobs over seas your product will be TARIFFED to a point that NO American will buy it. Since OBVIOUSLY this country is filled with irresponsible, traiterious consumers that drive there Toyota to WalMart and buy a bunch of Chinese, and Korean siht they don't need.If there is anyone you should be mad at it's these a$$holes.

They are happy to see rockets fired at Israeli cities, but they aren't happy when Israel defends herself.<br>  <br>  I see the only fix to Gaza is repatriation of civilians to an Arab country, and the elimination of terrorist groups.|`|fsjIeVpRaa	If I was Israel (Jacob [Ya?qūb]), I would be fathering 12 children.<br>  <br>  Oh, you mean "Israelis"!<br>  <br>  And there goes the Muslim bashing again!

The northern wins will bring the radiated particles back to Israel and harm them. Also Israel WANT the LAND, not genocide. If the Gazain people move out, Israel will halt its assault.|`|73c9d4fa33559b0b87d0a9b88bc8f2a3aa	No, bad idea. The fallout would affect Israel first of all, next you'd have the whole world up in arms and may actually trigger nuclear war. <br>  Israel is doing the right thing, tightening the screws on Hamas and making it their *****.|`|y0jkVO2Aaa	They can't.

Check the lease terms for a no compete clause but I highly doubt there will be one.  my suggestion would be to find a new location.|`|7uznrLBXaa	This really hinges on what your lease says.  Most landlords will only allow one type of business in each mall.  Read your lease.  Don't worry about proving anything - the mere fact that there are two competing businesses is enough.|`|YPLydxcXaa	nothing illegal about it, the nearest mall to me has 3 jewelry shops in it all diagonaly across from each other..if anything its better that way,as they have to work harder at customer service and competitive pricing to get a share of the market,better prices brings in more customers which is better for everyone involved,in the long run. that mall also has at least 3 beauty shop/barbers set up the same way all right close to each other, again that inspires a higher level of performance and customer service which is what fair trade is all about. NO one is entitled to a closed market without any competition,and there no reason the landlord shouldnt rent to as many similar venues as he can, the competitive prices and services will stimulate business thruout the mall.So now you just have to work harder,and price lower to draw in clients,since your not the only option.

Having people switch out of government every few years in generally a democratic value. This may be through periodic elections.<br>  <br>  These are a few of the values used to define democracy for political scientists.

NiYIPrkQaa	For thirteen years I, along with every other military member of the Army called the 1SG "TOP". In the Marines, Navy, and Air force it may be different.|`|dVQdswtTaa	Among some of us older Soldiers, Top is still used. Some 1SGs take offense at it,"do I spin on my head?", but most see it as a sign of respect. It is believed that the term comes from his being the "top" NCO in a company.<br>  <br>     I've heard "First shirt" in the Army, but rarely. It is an Air Force term, one that nobody seems to know the origin of. <br>  <br>  An Air Force buddy of mine tells me that a temporary 1SG is usually called a T-Shirt, and a prospective 1SG, (NCO shadowing the 1SG) is an undershirt.|`|8454b08cd94e39ec6f1c2eb2f2b07a68aa	Stan...in the Army, "Top" is a nickname for the 1st Sgt. <br>  <br>  The Air Force equivalent is nicknamed "1st Shirt"<br>  <br>  EDIT* It wasn't me giving the thumbs down...I gave you (Ray) and Stan thumbs up.

AA10096507	In terms of the United States:  Foreign Service Officer is a job category, while the term "diplomat" is more of a concept denoting someone who engages in promoting the interests of the US government, generally within a host country environment.

AA12339183	Hey Jason, well there definately are advantages to knowing someone in the department and being from their hometown, but they have to hire qualified police officers. Generally they go to some sort of formal training and then people apply to the department of their choice. More times than not if your applying to a job you will go to the one that pays the best or where you know somoene. If your looking to get hired make sure you get your training and then put together a great resume and prepare well for your interview! Good Luck!

How can this army have total disregard of civilian casualty? u target 1 hamas and 10 children and u think it's a success and this is the kind of 'peace' u want to build on?<br>  <br>  and to the people who says the palestinians or the israel people deserve it, then u have really lost ur humanity.<br>  <br>  To add on, trust is too deep a word for now.

Unions wages are paid to ordinary American workers, those viewed by CEO's and other wealthy elite as (individuals who are a dime a dozen) in other words they are insignificant, meaningless, small potatoes, people filling a meaningless spot on the payroll! On the other hand, CEO's are very important people, very dignified and very valued and should be paid above and beyond the pay scale spectrum regardless how much profits are made or lost while they direct a company! These people are the elite of America, the best of the best and even though in 2009, most CEO's have ruined their companies through mismanagement and bad decisions, they just move on to another company with millions of dollars in pay for their inept leadership! The worse job they do, the more pay they receive, that is standard operating procedure in America. On the other foot, American workers who have unions are penalized for working harder, they must forego pay, benefits and any other hard-earned perk to pay the company CEO for a substandard performance in his capacity! Its called corporate America and how we work things to our advantage! In the duration they bad-mouth unions , its members as "greedy" and the cause of why factories in America are now closed or closing, when nothing could be further from the truth! The truth of the matter is CEO's are greedy and could careless about anything but making as much money as they can even though the company is going down the tubes via their inept,  poor leadership and direction. What is so hard to understand about how corporate America and unions work in the United States of America! Hershey Foods in Hershey , PA left for Mexico and blamed the union wages for the move. They paid workers in Pennsylvania between $18-$22 an hour! Now in Mexico, they pay workers an average of $2.80 an hour, no benefits, no healthcare, no vacations! The CEO's cited the workers in Hershey, PA had every chance to accept the same as the Mexican worker did accept in Mexico and turned us down, flatout! $2.80 an hour! NAFTA, ( The North American False Trade Agreement) has the American worker by the butt in a down-hill haul and jobs will continue to flow out of this nation at an alarming rate. What about the lost CEO jobs? They leave with millions of dollars in a severence package and never really have to work again unless they want to become a billionaire! The average American worker get a lift off the end of a boot to get off the property just a little faster than immediately! That is their thanks!|`|xjcZkmpbaa	The market ultimately corrects wages and salaries that are too high.|`|DB7UMkGCaa	"Clue for repukes"<br>  <br>  Clue for Dems: Madoff is a DEMOCRAT|`|nkh3gyr8aa	workers are to do as they are told....they get the chaff, not the wheat|`|r6dsc5fNaa	It takes 4,000 UAW assembly line employee's salaries to equal the salary of a front office executive at GM.<br>  <br>  I think if that number was trimmed to 1000:1 no one would be complaining, and the country would be a lot better off.<br>  <br>  OK, so it's 4 European sports cars instead of 5, but I'm sure the executives will live.

It's illegal. <br>  In International law.<br>  In European law <br>  and in English Law. <br>  <br>  These laws weren't made casually. They were made to ensure a minimum standard and prevent such lapses into barbarity.<br>  <br>  There's another aspect. What do you do with people who you've tortured and you conclude they are innocent? Release them? Then what? Pay them millions in compensation.Then what action do you take against the torturer.

Labour - they have got us through these economic times so far, and thats why they won.<br>  <br>  When times were different, in July when Glasgow East voted for SNP, that was before all of this credit stuff began, and the SNP didn't have any problems, but now people have snuffed out their plans would have seen Scotland bankrupt, which is why they lost.<br>  <br>  So please don't insult us because we didn't vote the way you wanted, thanks|`|z5Y4PuT8aa	scotland does not love labour only the thickos and short term memories of a few who cannot think for themselves , fuel tax yes from oil well to pump over 300%is tax , pensions raped by gordon brown , road tax  less than one fifth is used to repair our roads , anyone who votes for labour does not have a mind of their own like glenrothesites , to think 91billion of our oil tax goes where? well brown, sorry brutus stab in the back , remember, brown what goes around comes around , the night of the long knives are coming soon|`|pxTjGTH9aa	Very Pleased :)|`|6QOKsVaPaa	hey you want to fix the world have at it.

Labour will still be kicked out at the General Election by the electorate that matters, Middle England, not a few thousand Labour loving, lazy, scrounging Scots!

3M1R22zraa	Would you want an intern operating on your brain?|`|PhTQn6ycaa	Didn't the Pats just do that when Brady got hurt? they're 4-2 now, not too bad. You know who did have experience for the job of president? George W. Bush. Maybe experience isn't what we should be looking for, it hasn't worked out lately. This year I'm looking for intelligence, so I'm voting for Obama.<br>  <br>  P.S. you don't get to pick who answers your questions anymore then a comic gets to pick who laughs at his jokes.|`|opj3720gaa	I will not be voting for Obama, nor can I see myself voting for a democrat at any point. That said, I think his experience is more relevent than a vast majority of politicians. I'm not going to go further into detailing it as you have your mind made up, but that's my opinion.<br>  <br>  Does that experience mean he's got the right ideas about what to do with the country? Obviously not. But you're attacking the wrong thing. |`|279c61f8b2894fa893eb424eb6ef74e3aa	ones a Hero the other is a Zero|`|53b4ab02a140c57fc81fc2889d6855bdaa	They won't be able to resist.
tROFU72waa	Speedy, you've only got ONE job in the Marine Corps that will allow you an Airborne school slot that's not given as an award or as a re-enlistment incentive.  You'll have to try and get a parachute rigger slot in the Marines.  That is the ONLY way you'll be on jump status as a woman in the Marines.  <br>  <br>  I earned my wings in the Marine Corps and worked at Airborne School as a Soldier and I'm quite sure of my facts.  You've got to decide what you want, Airborne or the Marine Corps because it's going to be bordering on impossible to get your wings as a woman in the Corps.  Best of luck in whatever you choose!|`|AA10096518	It is very difficult for anyone in the USMC to go airborne let alone a female.  Probably not during your intial enlistment, but for you next enlistment, you may get a 10% or less chance of getting into jump school.  I went through in 2002 and there were 10 marines who were in my class of 250.  Those 10 marines were all male and all were E5 and above or Officers.  I remember speaking to an E5 and he stated that he had to reenlist and have airborne school put into his reinlistment contract.  The only females that I encountered were in the army.  Also while I was stationed at Fort Benning I do not remember one USMC female airborne qualified person.  Don't want to burst your bubble, but I think you may want to get your information from someone who has been through the school.|`|be68e6d198f3f9ac69efb2146c8d907eaa	The Marine Corp is not an easy thing to get into for a female, although I have seen several of them in the Corp!  You need to be strong in body and mind and very disciplined to do what you are asking.  You had better be prepared to cry and wet your pants at least once and get over it just quicker than happens.  I say if you think you can then go for it.  If you are a pus*y and like to whine then think again.   |`|9ujZijBPaa	I don't know about the MC. However, I know many females who have gone  to Airborne training and then sent on to Airborne units. Technically, from what I understand, women can't "be" Airborne, but they can get the training and can be attached to Airborne units.|`|opj3720gaa	I could be wrong here, but if I recall correctly women aren't allowed into airborne. |`|icg864JUaa	Not sure about USMC but there are allot of women who go Airborn in the Army.
