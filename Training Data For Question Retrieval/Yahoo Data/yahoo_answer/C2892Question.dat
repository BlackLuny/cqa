Right, I work in a shop & basically our heating system in work has been broken for almost a year - its not an issue in the summer but all over Xmas, it was rediculously cold! I will work with a jumper on, a thick fleece jacket and even a scarf. My boss wont let us wear gloves though and because I also have low blood pressure, my hands physically hurt when it gets cold.   We have reported the fault several times but now the owners of the company said in a n email that they are refusing to fix any heating in their shops so that they can save money.    But this is making it VERY uncomfortable for us to work, one girl has even quit because she said she cant take it anymore.   How cold does the place have to be? and what action can I take to enforce that the system gets repaired???   PLEASE HELP!!!

20090205142023AAQMnJA	Environment;Global Warming	IS THE 'GLOBAL WARMING THEORY" A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF GROUP-THINK?	The term groupthink was coined by social psychologist Irvin Janis. He documented the following 8 symptoms:       Illusion of invulnerability –Creates excessive optimism that encourages taking extreme risks.       Collective rationalization – Members discount warnings and do not reconsider their assumptions.       Belief in inherent morality – Members believe in the rightness of their cause       Stereotyped views of out-groups – Negative views of “enemy” (or "deniers" in this case) make effective responses to conflict seem unnecessary      Direct pressure on dissenters – Members are under pressure not to express arguments against any of the group’s views.       Self-censorship – Doubts and deviations from the perceived group consensus are not expressed.       Illusion of unanimity – The majority view and judgments are assumed to be unanimous.       Self-appointed ‘mindguards’ – Members protect the group and the leader from information that is problematic or contradictory to the group’s cohesiveness, view, and/or decisions.       When the above symptoms exist in a group trying to make a decision, there is a reasonable chance that groupthink will happen. You can make a strong argument that the global warming fallacy can fall into each and every single one of Janis' symptoms.

20090205122829AAUgc2h	Environment;Global Warming	Table for water vapor heat retention, based on concentration?	I am doing some personal researching hydrogen fuel cells, and I want to information on why or why not they would be better for the environment than gasoline.      I would like to a table that compares the heat retention of water vapor to other "greenhouse gases," based on parts per million.   I have found plenty of sites that say "OH GNOEZ WATER IS WORST GHG BCUZ IT CONTRIBUTES SO MUCH" but I have an itchy feeling that this is biased simply because it is a lot more abundant than other ghg.      I need either a table that compares 1 ppm water vapor to 1ppm CO2 and others (or similar equal comparison), or at least enough enough information to determine the value myself.      Any help? Thanks!
