20090128152713AA5GiBq	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Do anyone know how to fight a ticket for tinted window?	I was recently stopped by a cop in San Gabriel, CA for driving my car with tinted windows. According to the officer, the ticket was not a "FIX" ticket instead it was an infraction under Vehicle Code 26708 (a)(1) The ticket cost $120. I was told by a friend that this was a fixed ticket and that I should go to court and ask the judge for an appeal. The officer never told me to fix the problem, but he just stated that if he sees me in two hours he can give me another ticket for the same problem. My dilemma is that I feel that I should be given the chance to fix the problem and not be subjected to go to court and traffic school for such a silly violation. Your answer will be greatly appreciated. Thank You!

20090128152713AA4mDd4	Politics & Government;Elections	Has anyone seen this proposed gun law and what do you think about it?	The link to this proposed law is found at the bottom of this optional detail window.      As pointed out by a dear friend, a "license" is the right to exercise a privilege. Not a right. Since a right is considered personal and an entitlement at birth, it cannot be easily taken away.      Bobby Rush, a Congressman from Illinois, has proposed a gun owner licensing law. In effect, it would require every gun owner in America to have a license in order to exercise their 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms, regardless of the fact that the right is not the same as a privilege.      Do you think this is appropriate considering that the same kinds of personal "rights" protected by the other amendments to the Constitution considered "the Bill of Rights" do not require licenses? Such as religion, speech, a fair trial, a jury trial, and so forth?      Do you think your government should require you to get a license if you wish to practice a religion or choose not to practice one at all?       http://www.nraila.org/Legislation/Federa...

In Alameda County, are School Officials, especially the Assistant Principal, allowed to search a student's personal cell phone without a warrant? And they have no evidence that the texts/calls are over illegal ordeals and such.   Example; A girl is texting in the Bathroom at Lunch, about what mile time she got on the run at PE, and a school official rushes in out of no where and takes the phone. Texts are sent to this girls phone while it is in the possession of the school official, and they are opened, and read, without the girls permission or any idea they were going to be opened. Later when the mother called the school official, he/she claims they were not opened, even though there is evidence they were.   Is this allowed in Alameda County? And is it illegal?

Ok, so a few weeks before christmas, I received a rather un-savoury comment on my Bebo page from someone I have never seen before in my life, online and off. I then proceeded to call this person an inbred before blocking them. Ever since then, this "inbred" has been harassing me and pissing me off on the internet and I would really like to live without this pest.       On YouTube, this person is making channels in my name, advertising me as a child molester, paedophile and other disgusting things. I have had each channel deleted and it seems this person has moved on from this activity and it is clearly not getting him anywhere.       Since then, I receive around 1-15 MSN friend invites a night because this person is going to chatrooms and telling people to add my email for "hot cam fun". It may sound remotely humerous on screen, but in reality, it is downright annoying and is really beginning to piss me off completely. He has also gotten hold of my friends email addresses and is doing the same to them, some of which have made new accounts just to get away from it.       My Facebook profile was also hacked into last week. This freak has sent all my friends, including personal ones, vile and slanderous messages that have labelled me everything from a rapist to a terrorist bomber. He is also in possession of personal details that I had tied to my Facebook profile, some of which he could, potentially, use against me in an illegal manner. He has not threatened to release the details, but I have a feeling he might.       I have also had my gmail account spammed with dozens of rubbish messages each day. This person has also hacked 2 of my friend's MSN accounts. He has also stolen some photos from my Bebo page, edited them to make me look stupid/disgusting/vile and uploaded them to an account he has admitted to have used to "troll me". The said account has been reported and should be deleted soon, hopefully.       As you can see, this person has caused me no end of hassle over the past few weeks and I would love nothing more than to get rid of this imbecile as soon as possible. My only real concern is that this person will threaten to post my personal details all over the internet, which is something that could, potentially, endanger me. If this were to occur, I would obviously seek police advise but right now, I don't know what I can do about this. Is what he has been doing classified as "illegal"?      All help, given that it is useful, is welcomed and thanked for. :)

Basically Obama says that to fix the economy, we have to bailout failing companies and corrupt CEOs.  And that the bailout money is to be given directly into the hands of corrupt money managers with NO strings attached.      And then somehow this will take country out of recession and will help ordinary citizens "find job", "pay bills" and "prosper".      Sorry but this is a joke. Its pure wastage of taxpayer money. The previous citibank, GM, AIG, bank of america etc etc bailout did not do anything to fix economy.       Why is that our politicians are very concerned about corporate executive fianances, instead of the finances of the ordinary citizens?      Let these failure companies go out of business. It will not hurt any of the "ordinary citizen".  The banks will need bailout after bailout each month. And they continue freezing credit and denying loans even to those who have excellent credits.        So what is the point of Obama bailout of $825 billion and how on earth are democrats, repubs and independents voting in favor of it?

My fiance's public defender came to see him last night (the night before his preliminary hearing here in California), and said that in exchange a "nolo" plea, the DA's office was willing to offer an 8-month sentence run CONCURRENTLY with the sentence he is already serving. A pretty good deal, seeing as the charges could carry up to 3 years in state prison.      This morning at the prelim, after my fiance entered the "nolo" plea the public defender was informing the judge that an the agreement had been reached with the DA's office as to a recommended sentence, but this time he stated "an 8-month sentence run CONSECUTIVELY."      My fiance tried to alert his attorney to the mistake immediately after it happened, but having the "awesome" people skills possessed by some PD's, the lawyer paid him no attention and the recommendation was entered into record as spoken in court.       At this point I do not know which type of term was stated in the plea agreement form, nor whether the slip-up was intentional (I would like to think it was not, but I'm not this guy's biggest fan...) or if he simply misspoke, but if it proves to be an intentional "inconsistency," what I would like to know is:      Would/could this be considered material misrepresentation of the plea agreement by the PD either to his client (my fiance) or to the court? If so, what remedies are available to my fiance to correct the mistake?       Would such intent also support a claim of incompetent council, or even legal malpractice?       The sentencing hearing was scheduled for 4 weeks out, so that (I am guessing) would be my fiance's final opportunity to (literally) set the record straight. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!

I recieved a three day out of school suspension for possing a emty can of chew in my back pocket. It was compleatly empty never left my pocket. Now i am 18. Our school policy is as listed It is the policy of the Manchester Community Schools to comply with Senate Enrolled Bill 459, Tobacco Free School Law.  The use of all tobacco products is prohibited at all times in all buildings owned and operated by the ####### Community Schools district.  Additionally, there will be no use of tobacco products on any school property, except during weekends, on holidays, and after 6:00 p.m. on school days.   So this can was empty and there was no feasible or possible way that a tabacco product could be used on school grounds.       in our code of contuct book it reads Senate Bill No. 459 restricts tobacco use on school    property.  All district buildings are considered    smoke free.  Adults may not use tobacco on school    property before 6:00 p.m. on regularly scheduled    school days.  Violators will be subject to criminal    misdemeanor penalty punishable by a fine.  The    legislation affects all persons-students, employees    and visitors (MC750.473)In addition, Act No. 314    of 1998 (Youth Tobacco Act) makes it unlawful for persons under the age of 18 to possess, buy, or use any type of tobacco product (MCL 722.641).  Smoking paraphernalia will be treated the same under the policy.  Students, 18 or older, may not use tobacco or any tobacco products on school grounds or at any school sponsored event at any time.      i did not use any chew or was it removed from my pocket untill spotted by my teacher. I came into school late because i was shoveling snow for my neighbor who is unable to himself and i forgot to remove it. i was suspended 20 min after arrival at school.       So For an empty chew can thats had no tabaccoo can i be suspended for 3 days when there was no potential use of the product. i simply dont want this on my record

20090128155019AAXVFQJ	Politics & Government;Politics	Will peace ever be achieved in Israel/Palestine as long as the US is supplying Israel with weapons/money?	It seems to me that as long as the U.S is giving billions of dollars in aid to Israel, the Israelis will have no real incentive to stop building new settlements, stop killing Palestinians and actually work towards peace. Currently, (most of) the Israeli govt couldn't care less about the plight of people who are essentially imprisoned in Gaza and the West Bank (no food, no fuel, no electricity, limited loans/cash and being killed like fish in a barrel) because the U.S. is right along side Israel handing them the axe to chop off their heads and they really don't answer to anyone else.  Israel has a right to defend itself against rocket attacks, but not by force as they so casually insist. They should defend themselves by using common sense and stop the constant push for new settlements, stop the economic blockade that has choked the life out of the Palestinians, and the policy of turning a blind eye or even encouraging Israelis to freighten, injure or kill Palestinians. Anyone who thinks that Israel legitimately wants peace has a lot of learning to do about the middle east.    And to anyone in support of Israel, please think about what i wrote before answering. I have no interest in hearing responses entirely shaped by western propaganda.    (by the way, i am a British American living in Chicago, so please don't assume i am some Lebanese radical or some nonsense. i have done my best to keep an objective view of this situation but the story is so skewed by the western media and policy makers that anyone who doesn't sing Israel praises is a radical anti-semitic nutjob.)    Please excuse me if I am offensive to anyone, I am just tired of all of this deceit and killing.

20090128155035AAUf5mV	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	What are rights of Unmarried mother, a UK citizen, Italian resident?	I am a UK citizen but have been living in Italy as a resident for 2? years with my children, fathered by a UK citizen. We are not married. He works in the UK and comes to Italy every other week, spending more or less 1 - 2 weeks in Italy. He considers Italy his home, as his family are here. The children attend school here.  He (barely) supports us financially, although I earn my way through assisting him with his company with computer work from home.  "We" bought a house 2? years ago and it is in my name, as are the bills. Due to the rising mortgage repayments, we started to struggle financially almost immediately and as a result, I am never given any money to survive on when he is away.      I want to sell the house but he refuses to do that (this is his dream home). He doesn't want me or our children to leave Italy. He refuses to return to the UK so that I can find decent-paying employment (I used to have a successful career paying GBP 60K p.a.) as Italy was proving fruitless.  He can't get a mortgage in this economic climate and already has a bad name with the mortgage company since the mortgage has never been paid on time since inception and we are still trying to catch up with payments when he failed/didn't bother to pay for 3 months.      Our relationship broke down irretrievably by September 2007, although we continue to live in the same house.      I feel like a prisoner in Italy, have no money to fight my case, have been slapped with a nasty lawyer's letter from him September 2008 saying I couldn't take the children out of the country without his permission quoting the Hague Convention.  He said that until I had a job in the UK, I couldn't take them out of Italy. He refuses to live there full time, or even just with me so that I can have the children with me while I look for a job, since I tried job hunting for a week each month but it's not easy when you're living in another country and when you're desperately missing your little children - they are only 3 and 5 now, were 2 and 4 when I started looking for a job in UK.      I'm desperately unhappy and don't know what to do. Some Italian lawyers have told me that I can sell the house and move back to the UK without his permission since we are all UK citizens. Some say that his lawyer is right, that I can't take them without his permission.      He's denied me talking to any of his friends or family about the situation any further since he doesn't want them questioning him or talking to him about it.      What rights do I have? What right does he have to keep me here in Italy against my will?      And, if I were to choose to stay in Italy, sell the house and move somewhere else, what legal rights to custody does he have over the    children? Can I change address without him and sort out custody/visitation afterwards?  I don't want to uproot the children or upset their lives any more than necessary, but changes need to be made.      Help!  I can't go to the UK authorities, I've already got a family lawyer lined up over there and she says that I have to deal with it through Italian law in the first instance.      Anyone know of a good family attorney who actually knows what they're talking about (and who speaks English)? Preferably in Florence.      Long-winded, but thanks for your time.

I didn't realize until later that "working on the economic crisis" involved him going back to Washington to sheepishly vote for the bailout that any real conservative would have oppposed - even if it was being championed by President Bush.  He followed this up by courageously not challenging an election that was revealed to have multiple instances of voter registration fraud, full on voter fraud (whatever happened to the ACORN investigation?) and campaign financing fraud (unless foreign donations to US Presidential candidates became legal all of a sudden when I wasn't looking).      Every since then, it has been a downward spiral, with zero people being able to stand up to Obama and actually speak out about his wrongheaded plans for America.      Now every time I watch TV, I see more and more Republicans rolling over for the Obama administration, defending and voting to appoint dirtbags like Eric Holder and Timothy Geitner while refusing to take a principled stand on anything.  I am sure they are also going to fall for Obama's "Second Great Depression" scare tactics and vote for whatever stimulus package he presents as well, regardless of how much pork, wasteful spending, taxpayer ripoffs, and national debt is involved.      Don't get me wrong, I would rather see Republicans being the loyal opposition and not doing stupid crap like accusing him of being a communist or a terrorist the way Hillary Democrats did during the election, but they aren't even doing that.  Without Bush leading the pack, it looks like the Republicans on the Hill have turned into confused children, wandering the halls with no sense of direction or obligation.      Are their any Republicans left who actually have the courage to stand up for their principles?  Do any of them even have principles anymore?  I don't think the question should be whether or not the Republicans will ever win an election again - it is whether or not they even deserve to.
20090128161122AA9sXTQ	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Question: State of Emergency?	Recently a ice storm went through my area and now the county I live in and the county I work in is both under a State of Emergency and it is asked everyone to stay home if at all possible.   I see no closing for my place of employment listed with the television stations and there is no one at where I work to answer the phones.  Do I take the risk and go to work?   "Oh, for this question":  I am a line worker for a furniture manufacture that is closing the doors in two months and know they are looking for any reason to let employees go so severance pay and unemployment don't have to be paid out.   What unlawful risks will I be taking (beside risking my life and possible put others in danger or getting there and they are shut down).

WASHINGTON (AP) - Massive deficits could force the post office to cut out one day of mail delivery, the postmaster general told Congress on Wednesday, in asking lawmakers to lift the requirement that the agency deliver mail six days a week.    If the change happens, that doesn't necessarily mean an end to Saturday mail delivery. Previous post office studies have looked at the possibility of skipping some other day when mail flow is light, such as Tuesday      Would you be okay with getting mail only 5 days a week to save money?

"...any time you and I are question the schemes of the do-gooders, we're denounced as being against their humanitarian goals. They say we're always against things, we're never for anything. Well, the trouble with our liberal friends is not that they're ignorant. It's just that they know so much that isn't so." -Ronald Reagan      Feel free and open to criticize, but conservatism is not about saying no to everything and it's certainly not about doing nothing. However, we are against deception of the public by passing bills with obvious fiscal shortcomings.      And criticism doesn't mean we are against its fundamental purpose in the eyes of the people. Criticism's true purpose is not to stop or insult something, but to make it better. And if wanting to make my country better makes me a horrible person, then I don't want to be good.

Now 634 billion presented by obama for health care reform.       People thought 700 billion was alot of money, but now I don't care if your a democrate or a republican. If you support all this borrowed cash, America is going to go broke before you know it. You simpley can't keep asking other nations to keep us rich. Its only been alittle over a month and this guy has spent more money than anyone in history and it doesn't look like he has no signs of stoping. Call me a fool for not supporting him, but I look at life as a realist. That money doesn't come from thin air, someone is going to want to get paid back. How is putting us further in dept helping us? If we grow, it will only be temporary because we will be temporarily rich. Then after all the money's gone and someone wants foreign country wants to get paid back, thats probably when the usa dollar will take a plunge!      Lets get real people. Who here wants to give away some cash to foreign countries so they can stay rich? If China constantly asked us for billions and billions of dollars, at what point would we say no? Eventually we would want to get paid back!       We cannot keep borrowing money like this. I am telling you, if people like Obama, Democrats, or Republicans thinks our paychecks are their hotchecks and they got a credit card with no spending limits, kiss the currency goodbye and hello Amero.

Just because he was accused of corruption and charges were pressed against him, he is still an innocent man in my book until proven guilty.       Moreover, the FBI have not shown to the public any concrete evidense, just said that there are phone call recordings, but that doesn't mean anything.      Until he has a fair trial, he is an innocent man. I just think this is some power play here cause he appointed Burris (an african american) to be the senator and I guess someone didn't like the notion of having another black senator on board... so they made Blagojevich look bad in order so that the Burris nomination didn't go through, but it did so their plan didn't work

We have been done the long distance thing(ive been there a few times and shes been here) and she actually was lucky enough to study here last semester for college so we have been reasonably lucky in the sense we have had good time together. We have decided to get married as its getting tougher and tougher being apart and truth be told I cant imagine myself with anyone else. She finishes college in May and does not have a job lined up as of yet but I wouldnt imagine too much of a problem as she is pretty smart and driven and has jsut began looking.    I want to go through all the right sources and do it correctly but I do have a question that is in the back of my head from reading about fiance Visas. The question is can I apply for a fiance Visa without her having a job and be successful with the application? If I filed now she would probably be employed by the time I got there(8-10 months I believe) or is this of any relevance. Also I was lucky enough to make good contacts over there and would have no problem getting a job(in fact I would be able to have an offer ready when I got work papers) but would that beneifit at all? I have looked at Visas to work in the US but I would end up being tied to that company/location but obviously want to be where my girlfriend is and where her job takes her. I would ideally like to start processing as soon as I can and maybe spend Xmas 09 together. Is this a possibility?

20090128163439AAO3Fvw	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How do I handle a neighbor who is harassing me?	I live on the second floor of a third floor apartment complex.  I am a single mom with two children.   One of my children is ADHD and autistic.  He has kind of a heavy step when he walks.   He sometimes has tantrums, jumps, and makes noise.   The downstairs neighbors have been complaining.  Of course, I sympathize with them but there is not much I can do.  My son can be out of control at times.  I would have to put him in a straight jacket to get him to stop.  I also must tell you that I get the same thing from the apartment above me (sounds of steps, furniture scooting, etc.)  It just goes with living in apartments.  The other night my son was jumping and the neighbor came up pounding on the door.  He scared me so I didn't answer it.  Then when he was walking away he said he was going to talk to the manager.  These people are being very unreasonable and rude.  The other interesting thing about this is the downstairs neighbors who lived below me for three years previously never complained.  I've tried to explain my son's problems to the neighbors also but they don't seem to care.  My son's developmental therapist offered to go with me to talk to them but I don't think that is a long term solution and I can't afford to move.  Yes, he is on medication.  But he is pretty wild before it kicks in in the morning.

20090128163902AAZ2Uve	Politics & Government;Elections	Since Republicans appear unanimous that a stimulus package is wrong, what should Obama do?   WWJMD?	After 8 years of Bush running record budget deficits, even in good economic times, we are now in what is clearly the worst economic times since the Great Depression (which we spent out of in the way of buying all the tanks and bombs for WWII).          Basic economic theory says that if:      Consumers can't spend enough to stimulate the economy      AND      Businesses are all going bankrupt, so they can't hire enough to stimulate the economy      AND      Traditional means of effecting the economy are exhausted (interest rates, bond market, etc)      THEN      Government spending can be used to get the gears turning.         Yet, Republicans have suddenly reclaimed fiscal responsibility, now, as our economy crashes (much like Herbert Hoover).         I'd like to hear reasoned and realistic solutions to the dire straits of our economy.....without increasing spending.      So, WWJMD....What Would John McCain do, if he won the election?      What would the Republicans do if they were in power?         (Note, also that a Republican controlled Congress passed spending stimulus bills of 300 BILLION in 2001 and 2002, for the dotCom bust, not to mention in 2008 for another 325 BILLION.....and a Republican President signed all of them)
20090128170648AAXO8kD	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Why do people think that age and location can save them from being sued?	That because their 15 and live thousands of miles away that they can't be sued for a criminal offense?      I'm a member of a grow taller forum, where someone is working on a complex designed to enhance growth via somatropic and androgenic complexes. His product is proven by large amounts of scientific facts, he has scanned in forms showing that companies did indeed manufacture this product. He also has smashed some serious myths:   1. Weight training stunts growth: Complete and utter bullshit, it does the OPPOSITE.   2. No pill will make you taller: Try Tamoxifen, a SERM, it's a PILL, you take it ORALLY, it's a PILL, you INGEST IT, it's a PILL, it INCREASE HEIGHT, hey it's a PILL, you take it ORALLY, get the idea?      And many more, like stretching won't do jack ****.       Anyway, a few days later, some 15 year old boy comes on and says "Then why don't the BBC know about it?", "It's a NEW DRUG, that I haven't heard about", etc. He then says he will come up with some evidence to back these claims up, and when could find none, he decided to attack my best friend online!       Then, the user who is working on this pill said "ITS CALLED SLANDER! Your telling everyone that I'm a fruad? I can SUE you! And don't forgert loss of buisness, I can sue you for that too!"      The 15 year old says "I'm 15 and 4000 miles away, good luck!"       Why do people think that age and geographical location matter in terms of law and order?      PS: Anyone who will say that the pill won't work, it will. It causes a hormonal imbalance (more HGH, IGF-1, Testosterone, Insulin and less Estrogen = GOOD!). It also increases Osteoblast activity. All of this is PROVEN BY A VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF SCIENTIFIC FACT.

Every person I've talked to who is in my position has had a recruiter tell him the same thing, but at MEPs they really put on a scare show about lying on your medical history sheet.

On the way back to the Oval Office Tuesday, the President approached a paned window, instead of the actual door -- located a few feet to his right.      Doors didn't open automatically for Obama’s predecessor either. While making a hasty exit from a 2005 press conference in Beijing, former President George W. Bush tugged on the handles of a door, only to find it locked.      Bush laughed off the blunder, but the pictures still live on as part of Bush's lame duck legacy.

Being new here & knowing how much influence this man has over my position I have always been happy to help him.

The post office, after ANOTHER huge deficit, is now asking Congress to allow them to eliminate 1 day of delivery to save money...so instead of cutting costs and laying off workers they are simply going to a 5 day work week to screw the taxpayer. Nice. If the government can't even run the post office properly, how does Obama think the government can solve all of our daily problems? How can the government be trusted to provide our education, health care, food, jobs, security, etc. if they can't even deliver the mail?!?!

If you're not willing to work when the economy is good, why do you care when the economy is bad?

Would somebody PLEASE wake up and admit this guy is just another big government liberal politician?  He's obviously more worried about keeping his donors happy than respecting the sacrifices of those who make his position possible.  Disgraceful.      "Barack Obama became the first U.S. president to skip out on the Salute to Heroes Inaugural Ball since its inception in 1953. The event recognizes recipients of the military's highest award - the Medal of Honor...      The Salute to Heroes Inaugural Ball did take place at the Renaissance Washington DC Hotel on January 20, 2009. 47 Medal of Honor recipients were in attendance at the event. The President traditionally attends, as does the Vice President and other dignitaries. Vice President Joe Biden did attend, but President Obama did not.      Instead, Barack Obama chose to be in the company of Kanye West, Beyonce, Jay-Z, Kid Rock, Stevie Wonder, Mary. J. Blige, Usher, Faith Hill, Alicia Keys, Adam Levine, Shakira, will.i.am, Samuel L. Jackson, Sting, Mariah Carey, Leonardo DiCaprio, Sheryl Crow and Marc Anthony, amongst numerous other celebrities in attendance at the balls he did appear at."       http://www.clevelandleader.com/node/8666     http://www.clevelandleader.com/node/8627

20090128163808AAspiQ4	Politics & Government;Elections	Am I stupid for working?	I just read that the house has passed Obama's $819 billion stimulus plan.  The report on it reads "The White House-backed legislation includes an estimated $544 billion in federal spending and $275 billion in tax cuts for individuals and businesses.      Included is money for traditional job-creating programs such as highway construction and mass transit projects. But the measure tickets far more for unemployment benefits, health care and food stamp increases designed to aid victims of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s."      So, I'm wondering why I am working if I can quit (or cause myself to get fired) and go wait in line for unemployment and food stamps.  Seriously, why bust my butt to work when others aparently aren't?  I'm tired of supporting them.  This stimulus bailout is just one more slap in the face for people that pay their bills and mortgages and work their tails of to do so.  Should I quit and live off the stimulus?

It has been said that the GOP opposes the stimulus package because they do not approve of the proposed earmarks or how money is being spent on them. Granted I am aware that we are in the midst of a primarily democratic congress, but I do believe that there are good ideas on both sides, and ways that at least some of the spending can be done in a bipartisan fashion. With that said, why is it that the spending is geared almost exclusively towards democratic ideas with seemingly little or no consideration for the GOP?

20090128171114AAWVCsL	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	If you had $825 million would you rather keep it, but know that it would still be available if you needed it, ?	Based on this stimulus package, it’s as if $825 billion is simply being invested in the economy, and the money is said to be going to programs that Obama insists will “work.” But the fact is nobody, including Obama has any way of knowing if any programs will work until/unless money is spent to try them, meaning that there is still the potential for failure among any of the programs even after money is spent on them. It has often been said that doing nothing would prove absolutely catastrophic to the already frail economy. But if the money IS put towards the proposed programs and the programs still fail on any given level, the money will already have been spent on them and will in a sense be gone, and the economy will STILL not be any/much improved, whereas the money would at least still be here if we had done nothing. So can anyone provide some insight as to where the economy will be if any of the program(s) still fail even after the $825 million is put towards them?   Also note that I am a democrat.
20090128171016AA5Wzoa	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Republicans: this may be the reason why Obama’s stimulus plan?	I don’t know about anyone else, but it seems to me as if Obama is simply allotting a set amount of money to go towards certain programs/earmarks, but without regard to how that money is spent on those programs. It’s as if he is simply throwing money at programs because he does not know how to make the money work for them, or how to enforce spending. For instance, it was mentioned that only 12% of the $825 million package will actually go towards jobs, and that only about 3.5 million jobs will be created or saved, which is nowhere near enough. Meanwhile, it was mentioned that so much money will go towards certain programs, but no specifics were ever given about how any of this money would be spent on these programs, a timeline for spending, or what the DNC hopes to achieve. Note that I am a democrat, but I was always skeptical about voting for Obama, specifically because I always thought the details of the stimulus package were too vague. I mentioned this long before the election was even held. With that said, my question is does anyone else get the impression that Obama simply does not know how to enforce spending on programs, that is explain why so much money is going to any given program, but rather is just giving money to programs and letting them decide how to spend it? Because if this is the case then Obama is clearly not qualified enough to decide how, or how much the money will be spent, and should never have been allowed to do so. So does anyone actually know if Obama is simply giving money to programs without regard to how the money is spent on them? Or has this at least ever even been addressed?

It is simply to get people to spend money as fast as possible. Efficiency is not the criteria. There are some criteria that improve the stimulus, but technical efficiency or social efficiency is not at the top of the list.       Things that improve the stimulus package are:   1) Spending on people or factors that are unemployed   2) Spending it on people with a high propensity to spend   3) Spend it on things that are made here, like bridges, and not in China   4) Spend it on worthwhile things that will help the economy grow later.      The worse thing to do is give in tax cuts to the wealthy, who will save it, or even the middle class, who will also save much of it.

((he raped me repeatedly 3 weeks after i had my son and i had stitches btw)) and if he has that it will be easier for him to file for visitation and stuff. and he has no job so i wont be gettin much anyways. so my question is what can they do to me if i don't go to the dna test? and it never went in front of the judge. oh and my new boyfriend ((actually we dated before but just got together)) not only loves cares and helps me with my son but so does his whole family so he wont grow up without a father.

I have a lot of respect for the military and would love to work for them.       I was the American Legion's Auxiliary choice to represent the town at Girl's State back when I was in high school. After I presented back to the women they said if we ever wanted to get involved we could. A few years before that, the American Legion picked me to recite "In Flanders Fields" at the Memorial Day Ceremony.        I only live in my hometown during the summers because I'm off at college. They're an American Legion Auxiliary in my college town as well. Would it be alright for me to join or would people wonder why I was there? Yes, my grandfather was in the Army but I don't have any siblings or other family members in the military now and it's not like I'm a military wife. I just don't want to step in if this doesn't seem appropriate for me. I can't ask my grandfather as he died years before I was born. Thank you.

No other spending bills in American history have worked, including the 2 trillion dollars spent under the G.W. Bush administration.  Japan did 8 massive spending bills during the 1990's a period that is known as Japan's "lost decade."

I know that it always pays to be prepared, but I also know that some branches ship you out to Basic faster than others.

Now, I have a friend of mine who enlisted in the Army on December 29, and she's set to leave next Tuesday, February 3, to BCT. Obviously, she didn't have the time I did to prepare yet I hear BCT is tougher than BMT. My main question is, when you arrive to BMT, is there a test done to measure how fit you are? If so, is one expected to do a number of push-ups/run/sit-ups in order to pass and not be sent to the "Fat Flight"? I ask because while I am nowhere near the definition of fat, nor am I terribly out of shape, I've never been the most athletic girl.

20090128180947AAGjQom	Politics & Government;Politics	What do you think about Obama's proposed vending machine policies?	Under Bush, people were able to buy a 20oz bottle of soda for a mere $1.00 -- some machines even offer it for as little as $0.80! But these machines have STOLEN jobs from deserving Americans. Therefore, Obama has proposed that a law be enacted which requires a Certified Vending Machine Operator (CVMO) be present at each machine when a purchase is made.    "Essentially, these CVMOs will be present to take the money from the customers. The CVMO will then insert the money into the vending machine, and select the product the customer requests. We will provide training so that each CVMO will become proficient at operating the machine they are assigned to. This will stimulate the economy and provide jobs. This is the gateway to an America with a significantly smaller unemployment rate.", explained President elect Obama.    But some critics are skeptical of Obama's change. CVMOs will earn a minimum of $25/hour and receive health, dental and other benefits. It is estimated that the average price of a 20oz soda will jump from $0.80-1.00 to $8.95-$10.00. Likewise, snack, coffee, sandwich and other vending machines will need to raise their price to cover the expertise provided by the CVMO attending to the machine.    "This is just  ridiculous!", exclaimed Andrew Pierce of Borchard Printing. "When I'm running late in the morning, I am sometimes forced to buy my lunch from vending machines at the office. I hate spending $5.00 for a  lunch. This change will make the same lunch cost near $25! I find it ironic that these people working as CVMOs are the ones who would need a CVMO to use a vending machine. This isn't rocket science."    What is your opinion on the CHANGE Obama has in store for the vending industry? Considering each vending machine would require a CVMO, that is a lot of jobs throughout the US!

I do wish that members of the GOP would quit acting like all of a sudden they've become brilliant, as if they have the answers to our economic woes. It is clear that after 8 years of their tax cuts--that tax cuts are not the answer.      If they worked as the conservatives like to advertise, we wouldn't be where we are today. If deregulation worked as they advertised, Wall Street wouldn't have collapsed like it id. The GOP said we'd be greeted as liberators going into Iraq, they were wrong. They said that Iraqi oil would pay for the war, they were wrong. They said that Saddam had WMDs, and they were wrong. They said giving the banks Billions with no oversite would result in thawing the credit freeze. Does anyone besides me see a pattern, and if so, what do you think is causing it?  Do you think Rush Limbaugh has gotten them all hooked on his Oxycotin?

20090128182647AAMamST	Politics & Government;Military	Question about national guard?	Ok, well I have been giving some thought on the national guard. I am about to graduate with my B.S in Civil engineering and do plan to go in the guard. However, I do not want to be in Iraq in the middle of the war while my position is being an engineer.       So if I do go in the NG, how does all that work. I have no military experience. I have been told I do NOT go in the guard as a grunt, but as an officer since I have a degree and I am pursuing a career in the active guard.      Also, I do not mind if my country needs me in Extreme situations such as hurricane katrina; they called the guard after katrina passed by. I actually like to do that kind of stuff, but not be deployed for like a year in iraq with out my wife or something, or be endangered and in the middle of a combat.      so for me with a BS in civil engineering, how does that work? what would be my roles? Would they call me if any states or extreem situations happen in the usa or would they deploy me as an engineer?      also whats the diffrence between guard and army? if they both go to iraq, why dont they just make it as the army?
