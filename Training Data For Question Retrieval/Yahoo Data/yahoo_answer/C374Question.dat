First of all its a pretty small plant standing at approx. 8-9 inches high. White flowers on the top of a red-purple stem (I happen to know the flowers also come in pink and red). The leaves are as wide as they are long and have a lighter green ring circle running around the halfway point of the leaves. The leaves have a purple underside. The leaves themselves all have a single stem which goes into the soil, so im assuming this is a bulb plant.       Thanks and here's to hoping someone will know :)

20060624211011AAE4L5a	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	This is an electrical question. . . .?	I will be using 12/3 Romex to make two separate circuits.  As you know, 12/3 is 20 amp wire, for two separate circuits.  There is a red wire (hot) for one circuit.   There is a black wire (hot) for another circuit.  There is a white wire (neutral) for both circuits.   In other words, the black wire and the red wire both share the common white wire.   Let’s say that one circuit draws 15 amps (red wire) and the second circuit draws another 15 amps (black wire).   That is 30 amps.   However, they both share the common white wire.   The white wire is now carrying substantially in excess of 20 amps.   In this case, it is carrying 30 amps and at full load from both circuits, it would have to carry 40 amps.   Add it up.  It means that the white wire is carrying the voltage from both individual 20 amp circuits (40 amps).  The white wire would melt and catch fire instantly.    Hence, 12/3 circuits and 12/3 Romex seem dangerous --- but they are used all the time.  I don’t understand.   ??????????

20081005203750AAhsVwr	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Installing new thermostat?	My place had a new honeywell thermostat but it wasn't programmable for day/night/time. I went and bought a timed one to replace it.      Something I never forget to do happened though. I did not write down where the wires went in the first one. Now I have a problem. The wire is a CAT5 with blue, brown, orange and green lines. All 4 were hooked when I opened the box. The system is heat and A/C. I can't get to the system in the attic crawl space to see what goes were. And, I don't know what brand/type the furnace is.      The thermostat I have has Rh, Rc, W, Y and G. There's is a red jumper between Rh and Rc. I figured the green is for the fan. I think the brown and the blue control the heat. The system only kicks in when both of them are in either Rc or Rh. The only thing is that it won't turn off when I switch the button to OFF and it won't send cool air when I turn it to COOL. I don't know what the orange does, and I don't think the green does anything either.      Do you have an idea of what I could do to get this working properly. Step by step installation with the wiring and colors that match. Maybe there's a sensor I can get to tell which is for hot and which is cold.      Thanks for you help.

20081006102230AAi8rWx	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Stove outlet wiring- 220 w/3 wires to 3 + ground plug?	We have a very old house. It will be very very hard to run a 4th wire, especially at a large gauge, to the stove. Question is this- the constant/white and the ground both hook up the same on our panel (yes, old panel).  So basically, were they color coded, we would have black, red, and a white or green to the outlet. The plug provided for the stove requires black, red, white, and green. As the white and ground are connected in the same way at the box, and the old stove was wired with only the 3 total wires (should have taken pictures before unhooking the old outlet!!) could the ground be left off? Would the new 4 wire stove still function? Could the white/ground be split since it's got either 6 or 4 ga strand wire and then be the white and the ground?   Here is a link to the stove, if it's relevant:  http://www.frigidaire.com/products/cooki...    Thank you!

20090205161607AAdWX9r	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Are stink bugs bad/dangerous to have in your house?	I live in a very woodsy kind of area and I constantly get stink bugs in my house. Im always killing at least 2 or 3 on the walls or in various places almost every night. I havent smelled anything bad from them (prob cause I kill em so quick), but is there any other harm in having them around? Also, is there any way to keep them out?

How cold do you put your air conditioner on in the summer?      Winter never any heat, hate heat get on my nerves and can't sleep. I live in Atlanta so I may keep my house 55 to 60 degree in the winter      Summer about 65 degree's      I'm use to the cold I guess, well being in a cold house, my mom always kept her house cold atleast in the 60's in the summer and never any heat in the winter.      For some reason 72 degree's seems so hot to me, I guess that's why I never go out in the summer time, lately in the atl it's has been 17 to 4 degree's the past few days , but with the wind chill more like below zero. I still don't see why people use cold air in the summer but not any in the winter. backwards if you ask me.lol

I have a splash mark about two to three inches in diameter on a nice med. dark wood table at home - looks whitish and I think it may have been a drink with alcohol in it, but no one is fessing up.  Does anyone know how to get it out?
