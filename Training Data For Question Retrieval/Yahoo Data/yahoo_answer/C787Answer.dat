jZRtTpZiaa	Soy is not "dangerous."  Do not "google" soy dangers and rely on anything you read on garbage websites for health information.  That applies to websites that claim soy is a cure for everything too.  Ignorance and gullibility abound online.  So does propaganda from the meat and dairy industry.  Meat and dairy also has estrogen in it.  That's a far greater health risk than phytoestrogens which are different-- and are in other foods as well.<br>  <br>  But some of the the prepared soy burgers you may buy are made with processed soy isolates-- isolated soy proteins, which do not have as long a track record as 'real' whole soy products like soy milk, tofu, etc.   If there's anything to be more cautious about, it would be to not overdo those types of products.   I do not concern myself with it whatsoever.  Processed foods are never as good for you as whole foods that are freshly prepared to start with.  There may also be a lot of salt in some of the pre-made products you buy.  Boca for example has 470 mg salt in one vegan burger.   I would not call soy burgers purchased in the freezer section "health food" at all.|`|a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	Soy really isn't very good for you. I wouldn't call it dangerous, but I hardly ever eat it. Just because "meat and dairy have hormones too" doesn't magically change the fact that soy has effects on hormones. <br>  <br>  A soy burger is also highly processed. Your body reacts much better to whole, unprocessed foods.|`|4VWSX7r8aa	It depends on what you put on it and what type of bread you use... Idf you are using a dense white bread smothered with mayo or butter, yes, it is fatty and filled with empty carbs... Whereas if you use a rye roll with garlic and hommus, your getting healthy carbs and protein.|`|5AbCtkWFaa	As long as you eat one made from organic soy and it doesn't have too many ingredients, it's far better than a burger made from animal's flesh.  Besides, meat has hormones too, and they are far more powerful than any piddling hormones in soy.

7GrncwiYaa	Corn grits and corn meal are basically the same material. When the corn is ground it usually goes through a sifting process, the larger grains are the corn grits and the smaller the cornmeal.  Corn grits can be used as a cereal or coating in baking. The finer cornmeal can be used like a flour in baking. Not as a substitute for flour though as there is usually no gluten so needs to have another type of flour mixed in with it.  Masa harina is made with a process that uses lime to soften the husks of the kernels and make the niacin more readily absorbed. The corn is then ground into a "dough", dried and powdered. This type of corn is used in tamale, tortillas and regional Mexican dishes.   The types of corn  used for  masa and grits are different as well.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Absolutely nothing but the name... they are all pretty much the same and are interchangeable. <br>  <br>  Sneaky, isn't it?|`|hyHySF6Waa	ABSOLUTLY NOTHING, BUT THE NAME, THEY ARE TRYING TO CON US ALL|`|FhKfyxWlaa	The texture.|`|AA11898755	Kudos to Frosty!!<br>  Spot on!
wLgGD63raa	You can, but I would definitely advise against it. The wax paper burns extremely easily. A better alternative would be parchment paper. You can also use silicone baking mats. They are a bit on the pricey side, but you will rarely, if ever, have to replace them. They can be used up to 2,000 times. You can get these at stores such as Bed, Bath & Beyond for about $20.00 for a set of two. They practically last forever. Or, if you don't mind washing your baking sheets, you can go without lining them at all. These are all good alternatives for aluminum foil.|`|287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	I believe you can bake parchment paper but I would personally not do it.

mxEzagl7aa	I’ve personally never been to the syrups and condiments aisle in my local Wal-Mart stores but I would be willing to guess that locating USDA Grade B maple syrup there would be very unlikely to impossible depending on where you are located in the country.  However, it might be worth a shot if you have the time and do not have to drive too far.  <br>  <br>  Most stores are unwilling to carry anything besides a few brands of Grade A genuine maple syrup along with the traditional artificial maple syrup brands.  I guess that they are afraid of looking bad if a lot of people see a product on their shelves containing “Grade B” on the label.  This goes for Wal-Mart as well as many other chain grocery stores, including many that carry premium brands or products. I’ve been through the syrup aisles in many local grocery stores in the Chicago area and have never found it.<br>  <br>  The only place where I have located Grade B syrup is at Trader Joe’s.  If you really need to have it (and I suggest that you try it at least once) you can find it at a Trader Joe’s near you.  If you don’t have a Trader Joe’s anywhere around you, you might try a natural or organic foods store or as a last resort, a health food store.  Of course, if you have the time to wait for delivery, you could always order it online as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for pricing, it could cost as much as genuine Grade A Syrup or a little more or less, depending on exactly where you locate it.  Grade B is supposed to be less processed and refined as it’s Grade A cousin, but specialty stores can easily make the price rise considerably higher.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	I don't know what Grade B syrup is, but you can buy REAL maple syrup at Walmart.  It's a little over $5 for one of the kinds they have

If the dough is not cooked meaning if the crust is raw just putting it on the rack could make a BIG mess but, if the dough base meaning the crust is cooked before you put your tops on SURE why not that would be just great. I would not just put raw dough right on rack. I would put it on a cookie sheet first then when it is half cooked then take it off and put your toppings on it and then bake. You can put the cooked crust right on the rack then. Just so you DON’T have to clean so much afterwords. Ok I really do hope this helps you, happy cooking and take care|`|fBSgY0C9aa	well try a cookie sheet...or just by a pizza pan and get it over with..putting the pizza on the rack isnt a good idea.it may stick and make a huge mess in the oven just get a pizza oan which you'll be able to use again. or just get a disposable, foil one <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck:)|`|kJX632msaa	It'll stick to the oven rack if you put it in without a baking sheet.

Collard greens are related to kale and mustard greens as well, and are relatively mild, the flavor approximating a combination of cabbage and kale. Unlike the curly-leaved kale, collard greens have smooth leaves.<br>  Collard greens are native to the Mediterranean region. Ancient Greeks and pre-Christian Romans cultivated this vegetable. There is evidence that collard greens have been grown in Britain for over a thousand years. The first record of collard greens in the United States dates back to the 1600s.<br>  <br>  Today, collard greens are widely cultivated in the American South, as well as Brazil, Spain, Portugal, regions of Africa, and other areas as well. The loose-leafed, non-heading plant is relatively hardy, tolerating frost and cold better than any of its cabbage cousins. <br>  <br>  A 1 cup (190 g) portion of cooked collard greens has about 50 calories and is packed with nutrients. It is an excellent source of vitamins C, A, and K, as well as manganese and folate. In addition, this same serving will provide a good source of calcium, fiber, and beta-carotene, as well as vitamin E. Rich in nutrients and antioxidants, collard greens are beneficial for supporting the immune system, the skin and bones, the eyes, and for aiding digestion. <br>  <br>  Collard greens are available year-round — fresh, frozen, and canned. When choosing fresh collard greens, avoid any leaves that are wilted or discolored and select only those that are deep green and unblemished. The smaller the leaf, the milder its flavor and the more tender it will be. <br>  <br>  Graham crackers are crackers which are made from graham flour, a type of coarse wheat flour which is high in fiber. The crackers are sweetened slightly, so that they taste more like cookies than crackers, and they are an extremely popular snack food. Some consumers are familiar with graham crackers as one of the crucial ingredients in S'mores, and they are also used to make cheesecake crusts and an assortment of other desserts. Many markets sell graham crackers, and it is also possible to make them at home.<br>  The origins of the graham cracker are quite interesting. The crackers were developed in the 1800s by the Reverend Sylvester Graham, a man who believed that a healthy diet was the key to a healthy and moral life. The health food craze was alive and well in the 1800s, with numerous proponents of whole grain foods including John Harvey Kellogg, inventor of the corn flake. Like many others during his time, Graham felt that sexual excess was unhealthy and potentially dangerous, and he promoted a sort of abstinence through health foods.<br>  One of the cornerstones of Graham's diet was graham flour, whole grain wheat flour which is left unsifted, so that it has a rich, nutty flavor and a coarse feel. Graham crackers were one way to get consumers interested in the flour, and they certainly proved successful. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, many modern graham crackers are made with bleached flour, with Graham strongly disliked, and they may use refined sugar and stabilizers to make their texture more uniform and consistent.<br>  A true graham cracker must be made with graham flour and sweetened with molasses. Small amounts of honey and cinnamon may be added as well, to make the flavor more interesting. Refined sugar, white flour, and chocolate are certainly out of place, although some producers include these ingredients. Reading the ingredient list on commercially produced graham crackers is an excellent idea, as they can actually be quite unhealthy.<br>  <br>  To make graham crackers, whisk two and one half cups graham flour together with one teaspoon salt, one half teaspoon baking soda, and a pinch of cinnamon, if desired. In a separate bowl, cream four tablespoons of butter with six tablespoons brown sugar, and then add one egg. Add one quarter cup of molasses or honey, stir to combine, and then mix the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients to form a stiff dough. Roll the dough out to the desired thickness, and cut it into rectangles. Pierce each rectangle with a fork so that the graham crackers will be crispy when they are finished, and bake them at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) until golden brown, around nine minutes. Lining the baking sheets with parchment paper will make it easier to remove the finished crackers<br>  <br>  From your neighbor across the pond|`|KZ0ERprraa	yes...here is one...trepidation|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Collard greens are like mustard greens, dandelion greens, kale and spinach - Just dark green leafy greens:) ...

Contractors are trying to make as much money as they can, they will serve food that is start to get moldy and buy day-old bakery items and sell them for full-price to hungry students. I knew someone who worked for a contractor, she told me her boss knowingly served moldy food and she would throw it away when he left the building. I forbid my daughter from eating in the school cafeteria after the meals were contracted out, several students saw mold on some of the foods, and she was in high school when that happened.|`|39e96e9e3c0bce02422416332ccfeecbaa	it should always be looked into.  because if you offer a contract, you can stipulate that the vendors serve some healthy stuff and you'll still save money by going with a company that actually knows what they're doing|`|nnn9wEUXaa	I would imagine that there would certainly be little harm in doing so as long as the options available are not artery clogging.  If a school district were to enable such a program, no one could really stop them, plus it could also serve to boost student morale and could even prevent students from ditching lunch to eat off campus.  Ok, not prevent, but limit.  Should they?  It all depends on what the residents of the district have to say, but provided that the private vendors offered healthy selections along with the typical junk they sell (I exclude chicago-style hotdogs from the junk category, mmm mm good) I would go ahead and say yes, personally.

doz7RIoeaa	No. <br>  If PETA really are not the hypocrites that they are, then they should follow their own  propaganda line that animals are not theirs to give or deny rights to. According to them, as humans, they have no rights or dominion over animals.  Deciding for them and giving them something is against their own doctrine since it implies that groups like PETA are superior to animals and can bestow upon them "rights". <br>  <br>  And to follow your line: did you know that animal abuse is a crime? That Ingrid Newkirk has survived for decades on a drug that has been researched and tested on animals? PETA has long called for the total extinction of pit bulls and has killed healthy cats and dogs for the sake of expediency (no budget they said). What about THEIR rights? Animal welfare is a serious issue yet PETA chooses to make it into a laughable and insignificant issue fit only for weak minded fanatics.|`|TJOHxhEUaa	Well, I don't know about the right to vote! ;-)<br>  <br>  (By the way, it's "poll", not "pole".)|`|blhIjLr8aa	Yes they should..|`|0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	it's hard to say.<br>  <br>  i wish that animals could talk to us,<br>  and we could communicate with them.|`|fXDKPbbBaa	NO not at all humans were not meant to be vegetarians we are meat eaters sorry PETA dang you guys are getting out there ain't you<br>  <br>  i think i steped on a few veggie toes here.... roflmao|`|ssdl5qL5aa	They should be left alone, that's for sure!

They are far too willing to exaggerate or even lie to further their goals. And even then, they'll bypass their own ideal when it suits them.<br>  <br>  I do not think animals should have equal rights as people. They should not be abused or suffer needlessly, but they are not people, they are animals. You're never going to convince everyone to support universal vegetarianism. Even in the modern age, with the vegetarian diet getting so much press and attention, the actual adherents to the practise are a very small portion of the population.<br>  <br>  These kinds of articles are the reason many vegetarians get harassed, it is both arrogant and condescending. It is based on the assumption that the vegetarian is somehow morally superior because of his diet and the rest must be shown the error of their ways.|`|hEAdpYHvaa	Animals should be granted rights, of course, but never to the extent of humanity's rights.

But they deserve the right to freedom, and NOT to suffer so severly in thousands of ways by humans cruel hands.|`|gL78jvY9aa	I think they should be left alone as much as possible, because people are always interfering with animals and making them go extinct, or tearing down their habitats. We gotta be respectful of their way of life too.<br>  <br>  Perhaps humans and animals should be "seperate but equal".|`|r0xeCZAQaa	Well, of course, since they don't have to pay taxes or rent, I would say that animals don't have the right to vote.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I find myself in a quandary.  The animal kingdom is very broad.  I think that cute kitties, lions, giraffes, dogs, animals who live far away from me (like bears and tigers), etc. have the right to live and seek happiness (provided they do not try to do that by trying to kill me).  On the other hand, I do have issues with cockroaches and their right to live in my apartment. I will kill them and then pray over them and offer them puja and wish them a beautiful next life.  Same goes for any other bug I find in my apartment.  I just am not Buddhist enough to let them run rampant in my house, even if they were on this land first.  I will do anything I need to do to get them to go away forever.  I do try to talk to the head cockroach to see if we can come to some agreement about me not killing cockroaches unless I see them -- the head cockroach is apparently replaced often -- sometimes I go months without seeing a cockroach, and then sometimes it seems as if lady cockroaches have been sent to my home to give birth.  When I lived in Virginia Beach, VA, I was successful with talking to the head mosquito -- I understood that there were different kinds of mosquitoes - duh - there were big ones and small ones -- and I just called out to a head mosquito and explained that I was very mosquito-ist and could not really distinguish between different kinds of mosquitoes, but, if mosquitoes stopped biting the people in my house, I would not kill mosquitoes in my house. It was very interesting - mosquitoes stopped coming into our house, and we were not bitten again by mosquitoes anywhere at all.  My room-mate thanked me.<br>  Unfortunately, the cockroaches do not seem to get it, so I kill them when I see them, and then I offer puja and wish them a nice next life)|`|sJIGwThCaa	No...they can't talk, can't go to school like humans (they can go to school, but they can't learn math or science), therefore they can't get the same jobs humans can, and most don't even have opposable thumbs. We feed our pets (we give up our money to feed them), so they can give up some of their rights in exchange for us basically giving them life...|`|F3LBgfvwaa	I'm not reading that, but to say they should have all the rights as humans is ridiculous.

EMDNVrcjaa	The zone diet website is very informative. I don't see the percentages you talk about, they say, 1/3 protein and 2/3 vegetables and fruits and a dash of fats. So, I would say no, there is no naturally by itself zone food since it is protein and vegetables and fruit and fats. There are a ton of recipes and snack ideas on their website. I included the quick start guide link, it has meals, snacks, etc. <br>  <br>  Here is a sample of the website. This is their snack page.<br>  <br>  <br>      Easy Zone Snacks<br>  <br>      Snacks are like mini-meals on the Zone Diet. Each one contains a small portion of protein, carbs, and fat.

KX8oWwDzaa	It says to use 1 TBSP of coffee per 6 fluid ounces, but each cup of coffee in your pot is 8 fluid ounces, so you would need exactly 1.3 TBSP of coffee per every cup you are making for the perfect cup of coffee.|`|ZSyyTjokaa	The coffee scoop that usually comes along with a new coffee maker holds slightly more than a standard-measure tablespoon.  In any case,  you can use a regular tablespoon measure for your coffee  (by which I mean an actual measuring device,  that comes with all the other-sized measuring cups, not a silver tablespoon that you'd use to eat with).<br>  <br>  A level tablespoon  (dry coffee) will produce 1 average-strength cup of brewed coffee.  Keep in mind, though,  that according to coffee makers' specs, a  "cup"  of coffee is 5 fluid ounces.  I don't know why that is,  it just is.  A typical-sized coffee mug---the kind that most people  drink from---holds between 10 and 12 fluid ounces.  So,  if you plan on drinking 2 cups of coffee  (from a typical mug),  you'd want to measure out about 4 level tablespoons.|`|EFOBeGu4aa	All scoops sizes are different.<br>  <br>   I simply use a teaspoon per 2 cups on the coffee maker.

hEAdpYHvaa	If you are practicing veganism, just straight up tell your boyfriend. He's not going to dump you for it, and if he does, then he wasn't the right person in the first place. But seriously, his family will learn to accept the fact that not everybody supports cruelty. If I were you, I would go to the dinner and eat what's vegan. However if you're asking what the rules of being vegan are, they are not eating or using animal products. So if you are going to choose to eat "a little veal every now and then," that is not even vegetarian... you're a straight up omnivore, sweetie.|`|2RzEaod9aa	It's perfectly fine to eat a little veal now and again, but you'd be a liar if you continued to call yourself a vegan after that. <br>  <br>  Either you really care about animals and think it's wrong, or you only care about animals when it's convenient for you. The latter doesn't make you vegan.|`|ssdl5qL5aa	You would no longer be a vegan. Vegan is just that, a lifestyle. If you did it for the animals, the environment and your health, you'd never even give rotting flesh a thought!|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Haha, this could be a movie! Vegan dats slaughterhouse owner... falls in love and tempted to eat meat.<br>  <br>  And veal? Wow! Of all the meats for a vegan NOT to eat, veal would be it. I mean, don't get me wrong, veal is delicious, I love it. But veal is basically baby cows that are forced to live in a tiny box in the dark and are force fed until they're fat enough to slaughter. <br>  <br>  Yeah, crazy stuff.<br>  <br>  So I gotta wonder, is being vegan really for you? Most people go that route for animal rights purposes... seems like you're trying to be hip. If you're not serious about giving up all animal products all the time, then you shouldn't be vegan. Because I honestly think your slaughterhouse boyfriend would probably have a problem with it.<br>  <br>  I know that I had trouble with a girl I dated simply because she was a picky eater; I love food and going out to eat and cooking elaborate meals, so being with a picky eater was excruciating. It just wouldn't work.|`|9gPlIs3Xaa	Yeah cause I am sure it would taste amazing - these people will surely know how to cook the veal - however you aren't a vegan if you do - nor a vegetarian.<br>  <br>  Also remember cigarettes have animal product around the part you put in your mouth (so that it doesn't stick to your lips) so you need to stop smoking if you do that in order to be a vegan.|`|jZRtTpZiaa	Veal is from a cow's baby.  It's one of the most horribly cruel meats a person can buy.  Eat it if you wish, but you'd not be anything close to a vegan.   Why would you want to be a vegan who eats veal? There is no such thing.

AA10466359	I am not following your recipe. Are the potatoes a separate dish then the meat and rice? If so boil the potatoes in a little salted water with pepper and a Tablespoon of butter, about 10 minutes. This will partially cook them to just fork tender not completely done. Then drain the potatoes and put the sauce on, then simmer for another 15 or till tender. I would cut them in slices about 1/2" thick not chunks.<br>  I have often made stewed potatoes with onions and ate it on rice. That is tasty but never wanted to put ragu or tomato sauce on potatoes. <br>  <br>  Stewed creamy  potatoes<br>  1 onion, carmelized(fried slowly till soft)<br>  5 to 6 medium red potatoes <br>  Salt to taste <br>  Black pepper to taste (most people like to go a little heavy on pepper) <br>  6 to 8 slices of bacon for seasoning <br>  2 tablespoons all-purpose flour for thickening (I like this better than cornstarch) <br>  1/2 canned milk or cream<br>  1/3 cup water <br>  2 ice cubes <br>  1 Tablespoon of butter<br>  1/4 cup green onion tops chopped<br>  Peel potatoes, cut in 3/4-inch cubes, Lightly brown in butter or margarine in a deep pot.(not completely cooked just brown a little) Cover with water. Fry bacon crisp, in another skillet  and drain on papear towel. Add a little bacon fat to the potatoes. Bring to boil, then reduce heat to a simmer until potatoes are almost tender. Leave them with a little firmness they will finish cooking.<br>  Drain 1/2 the water off, reserve. Add cream and carmelized onions n lots of black pepper. Bring to a simmer on low for 15 min. Place flour, water and ice cube in a small jar. Put lid on and shake until flour is dissolved. Or cornsatarch and cold water. Then while gently stirring the potatoes, slowly add the flour-water  or cornstarch water until the soup in the potatoes reaches the desired thickness you want. This is why you saved the potato broth, if it is to thick add some of it back till creamy consistancy. Cook 5 minutes more. When done add 1 spoon of butter, green onion tops and crubled bacon. Let them set 10 mint before serving on rice.|`|yXno8yIkaa	What I would do is, make the meat and rice with the sauce and bake the potatoes whole. When they are done, cut a slit along one of the long sides, fluff the potato a bit with a fork. Then top it with the meat rice sauce and some shredded cheddar cheese. Yum!|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Wow, sounds like an exciting meal. You can't cook raw potato in tomato sauce. They need to be cut and boiled first. Then you can add them to the sauce and let them soak up some flavor.<br>  <br>  Sounds like this needs to be kicked up a notch... why not make this and then stuff it into bell pepper?|`|1jIzBUkhaa	I would cook the potato first , and add them last to the sauce after everything was done.|`|evB63qWvaa	Also, usually people don't prefer to have potatoes and rice together.|`|bspRfskYaa	You need to par-boil the potatoes first as they won't cook properly in the ragu sauce|`|AA11766809	You can boil the potatoes for about 15 min and then take them out, strain them, and put them on a tray with some butter, feta cheese (crumbles) and some chopped dill, and bake them in the oven for about 10-12 minutes.<br>  OR, just boil them (cut in pieces) and when ready, poor ragu sauce on top of them. Sprinkle some fresh cut parsley...and Bon Apetite!
5zNwBQZHaa	Since white rice has very little flavor on its own - just about any savory spice you put on it would work well.<br>  <br>  Just make sure to add a little salt while cooking it.|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	pretty much anything. white rice will just pick up whatever flavor you add to it so use whatever you have on hand that you like. If you really want to flavor it though I'd suggest substituting stock (veggie, beef or chicken) for the water.|`|200f630432eb7a10b4eb96339e0c7d41aa	All of the answers everyone gave were great. Here are a few items I would consider:<br>  <br>  -Cook the rice in various broths/stocks to begin with instead of water: Chicken, beef, vegetable...<br>  <br>  -To enhance rice to achieve more "exotic flavors" try using:<br>  <br>  (Add to cooked rice):<br>  -shredded "unsweetened" coconut<br>  <br>  (Add to uncooked rice before cooking):<br>  -cilantro (either dried coriander seeds or 1 T. of chopped fresh cilantro)<br>  -cardamom pods (use about 3-4 when making about 6 C. of rice)<br>  -cinnamon stick (1-2)<br>  -coconut "water" (not the cream)<br>  <br>  Another flavor enhancer for rice is to take the raw "white" rice and brown it gently in oil. How to: Take a skillet and add in about 2 T. of oil (veg., corn, canola or olive oil), add in about 1-2 cups of rice, stir it all around coating the rice with the oil thoroughly. On med. heat, move the rice around slowly until it starts turning light/golden brown. Don't let it get burned. Remove from the heat and cook with the liquid source of your choice: broth, stock, water, etc... This is a very traditional Latin approach to cooking/using rice in various dishes.|`|jr2yqSJqaa	Saffron, parsley, paprika.<br>  <br>  A pat of butter also works.|`|a001e75343163f8a6da4b4cfc9b7d335aa	I like it with a little saffron or garlic|`|AA10928232	saffron<br>  salt<br>  pepper<br>  lemon<br>  thyme

r0xeCZAQaa	in a basic vegetarian diet, the only rule is you don't eat anything that had a mother, so knock out any meat (red meat, white meat, fowl, seafood, insects, creatures that creep on their bellies, etc.)<br>  <br>  then you can eat anything else. <br>  vegetarian protein sources include milk, eggs, soy products, vegetables, fruit, raw nuts and seeds, and sprouts.<br>  <br>  People who follow a vegetarian diet for health reasons believe that it is easier for the human body to digest fruit and vegetables and nuts and seeds than to digest meats.<br>  Indeed, current medical research has noted that people who eat a more meatless diet tend to experience fewer incidences of life threatening diseases like cancer.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Vegetarians eat no meat <br>  Vegans eat no meat as well as no animal products like eggs, milk etc. It's considered healthier b/c of the fat in meat but, if you eat deep fried onion rings you aren't being very healthy are you?

pMFLqU0Yaa	You can mash any root vegetable like carrots, turnips, etc just like you would potatoes. There are actually Scandinavian dishes that basically translate to "root mash" in English. They're quite tasty!<br>  <br>  Also, Cauliflower makes a great cream soup that is not heavy or fat laden at all. I make it by simmering cauliflower in some chicken broth or vegetable broth (just enough  to barely cover), toss in some salt, pepper, celery leaves (yes, the leaves, not the stalk - the produce dude gives 'em to me for free, so just ask one of them) and large baking potato cut into cubes. The potato is your thickening agent for the soup. After everything is tender, blenderize it to a puree. Ta-Da! Soup! You can do carrots, broccoli, asparagus - all kinds of things the same way. Just adjust your seasonings. When I do a creamed carrot  soup, I throw a peeled, cored apple cut into chunks in there as well. It adds sweetness to the soup and compliments the flavors. A bit of ground or fresh grated nutmeg also goes good with that flavor combo. Another favorite flavor combo of mine is butternut squash and apple soup, prepared the exact same way as the carrot soup. I use a veggie stock most often for soups with a slightly sweet taste to them.  <br>  <br>  Another thing you can do to "hide" the veggies is to finely shred them and add them to other foods. I used to do this with my son when he was a child. Now he is an adult and eats salads by the bucket full! Just choose complimetary flavors. Like shredded zucchini and/or carrots in pasta sauces, pureed spinach hidden in burgers or pasta dishes, pureed red peppers in sauces or burgers or chili, etc. If he wants the nutrients from the veggies but doesn't like the texture or taste, it is easiest to just "hide" them like that.

Nowadays there are so many chemicals out there, especially in meat, the fact that its not just tissue that you're eating (could be muscles, blood, intestines) and you can never really find out, and all the genetically modified meat and things like that I just don't see it as appealing to be eating it.  If you want to get into a good topic look up genetic modification. It has to do with how they either clone, mass produce, things like that...

AA12070832	I am also a vegan and in a typical day i eat the following<br>  <br>  Breakfast<br>  1 bowl of Nature's Path Cereal, two slices of toast with earth balance, piece of fruit<br>  Snack<br>  Back to Nature crackers with 1 tablespoon of peanut butter (usually 10 to 15 of these which is 3 servings, 1 serving only has 70 calories and 2 grams of fat)<br>  Lunch<br>  Homemade vegetable soup with rice, black beans, corn, carrots, 1/2 cup soy milk and molasses (in the soup), a tofurkey sandwich with veganaise<br>  Dinner<br>  Boca Burger with fresh cut (meaning a fresh potatoe) fries and an apple with peanut butter <br>  <br>  Twice a week I have dessert which adds some fat to my diet and a little sweetness. According to the new food guide pyramid for vegans you should eat three servings a vegetables a day (1/2 is a serving), three servings of fruit (1 medium piece of fruit of any kind or 1/2 cup cooked), 2 or 3 servings of beans and legumes (soymilk does count), 5 or more servings of whole grains ( 1 slice of bread, etc.). I consitently eat only two servings of fruit a day, three servings of veggies, two servings from the legume group and 6 to 8 servings from the whole grain group. This supplies me with everything that I need. As for you I would recommend 2 glass of Silk soymilk a day from Vitamin B12, a trickly little vitamin for us vegans to get, vitamin D and calcium. I would also reccomend 3 servings of vegetables (1/2 cup of cooked vegetables or 1 cup of raw leafy greens) and for fruit i'm no expert but two servings is a good place to start. Eat across the rainbow also helsp ensure you get what you need. While one vegetable might be high in calcium, another might be high in iron or in protein. Try this one day and see how you feel. <br>  For breakfast eat<br>  1 bowl of cereal, two pieces of toast and a piece of fruit<br>  For lunch eat<br>  A Vegan Boca Burger, fries or baked lays, drink a glass of soymilk and eat another piece of fruit<br>  For Dinner Eat a Tofu Stir Fry with brown rice, 1/2 cup broccoli, 1/2 cup peas tossed with rice vinegar, soy sauce and sesame oil and drink another glass of soymilk<br>  As a snack have a handful of nuts like cashews and of course all the water you can stand<br>  I would aslo recommend the book the Complete Idiots guide to Vegan Cooking by Beverly Lynn Bennett.

In a sauté pan, brown chopped almonds and oats till golden. Set aside. <br>  <br>  In a sauce pan over medium heat, combine brown sugar and honey until they're completely dissolved. Simmer this sauce for 1 or 2 minutes, or until it gets bubbly. Remove from heat. Add vanilla and stir until combined. Add peanut butter and cinnamon, and stir until well combined (be sure to get all the lumps out.)<br>  <br>  Add to this mixture the oats and almonds, wheat germ and raisins. Stir until the mixture is well blended. Pour the mixture into the greased pan and firmly press until the mixture is evenly distributed and level. <br>  Bake for 10 to 20 minutes, but be careful not to burn. Keep an eye on the bottom of the pan. Remove the pan from the oven, and let the mixture cool completely before you cut the bars. While the mixture is cooling, press down a few times with a spatula to help it keep its form. The bars should be stored in an airtight container.|`|Fyd0CaqTaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Yes! Granola Bars are yummy ok i have this for you have a try and hopes it works for you good luck!
RO02uqhnaa	First, cut back to one egg per 1 1/2 lbs. of meat and soak your bread crumbs in milk until they are fully hydrated. This will let you cook the loaf longer without drying it out. Also, I have seen MANY meatloaves that look slightly pink in the middle after an hour of cooking. You shouldn't need to cook a meatloaf longer than an hour if you shape it right. Cook it centered in a cake pan or cookie sheet. Make sure that it is no more than 2 1/2 inches tall and bake at 350 for an hour saucing/basting at the very end. <br>  <br>  Another idea that my friend uses is forming the meat around a kielbasa. It gives the loaf a good smokey flavor and creates a pre cooked center. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  EDIT:The ketchup in the middle(juiciest part) will cause pinkness, even when the meat is fully cooked.The outer part colors because it was hotter for longer. Think of homemade spaghetti sauce, you cook down the tomato paste long enough and it turns rust colored.|`|oE0ApHqPaa	Cover it with foil, then take the foil off for the last ten minutes or so.  Buy an instant read digital thermometer (about $10 or so) and don't go by the color (the ketchup could be making it appear pink), go by the internal temp (at the thickest part of the loaf).  According to the FDA, it should be 160 degrees kill bacteria.  You could also try making the loaf a bit thinner, or try the cupcake pan idea.  I've done that and they were AWESOME, more brown outside part for everyone.|`|0b508e8a46ceb076d498c94707fa4b1aaa	Set your oven at 375F and cook uncovered for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The only other thing I could think of for it not to get done in the middle is if you added the ketchup to the meat mixture before cooking. If you did that then it would not hold together well either. The ketchup goes on top of the meatloaf.|`|fDGlC403aa	Play it "Bat Out of Hell".<br>  Then cover it in tin foil so the top doesn't burn and let it cook until the pink is gone.<br>  Don't eat uncooked hamburger.<br>  Make sure it is in center of oven.|`|WHH7Mpieaa	i use about 1 1/3 pounds of meat, and it takes about 45-60 minutes to cook at 350. <br>  <br>  i would guess you might be making the loaf too thick.  try it in a 9x13 roasting pan, and make the loaf a bit longer and flatter than usual. <br>  <br>  and i disagree that ketchup would cause it not to cook.  (unless you're literally putting a filling of ketchup in the center)<br>  <br>  i use beef, a pack of onion soup mix, and a few dashes of milk. no eggs or bread.  it cooks nicely, tastes great, and holds together like a burger.|`|7cUDstdjaa	Oven's too hot. Cover it in foil and cook it at 275 for an hour longer|`|MS6IzOPLaa	Try cooking it longer and covering it with foil...or put the raw mixture into muffin cups instead.

While you were getting all of your bonuses, you, the janitor and the delivery guy were able to live comfortably, so you were happier and more productive, making you all more money.  But then I decided that since I had more than compensated for you making minimum wage, you didn't actually need ALL of the compensation you were due.  Doesn't seem fair at all does it?

Besides if you don't tip and others do, you will spend at lot of time waiting at the bar rather than drinking beer.<br>  <br>  Regards|`|e2urOEazaa	Ummm..yeah. You should still tip them. They still got you a beer. Often times they are splitting those tips with other bar employees as well.|`|ZLH7qSYmaa	no.. at 4 bucks a beer. they should be lettingj you keep the bottle and make sure you get laid.. 4 bucks dude.. thats like a 6 pack at the store.. get a noggin on ya lad.. thats a rip|`|K0oY5NTtaa	nahhh

When I was recovering from anorexia my dr. had me make Carnation Instant Breakfasts with whole milk (mmmm!!!) and drink them with breakfast and before bed. I gained about 5 pounds in month doing that which is a lot because i"m short. Also i found it's better tasting than ensure or slim-fast, which ironically will also help you gain weight if you drink a couple a day :-) <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|DKfScL8taa	Not ovaltine. ovaltine is a kids chocolate drink.

I had such a stomach ache and because of all the sugar, I had swollen taste buds for two days. :O  I always tell myself, "never again," but I know next year, when in confrontated with a bag of conversation hearts once again, I will read 'em and eat 'em.  It's a problem. <br>  <br>  :(|`|DKfScL8taa	Yes. One time I ate a whole bag of ranch dorritos. About an hour later I threw up the whole bag. It just sat in my stomach.

The USDA has a program for free that allows you to input your food intake. It will analyze everything: calories and nutrients (carbs, protein, vitamins, minerals, fat).<br>  <br>  If you keep track of it for a week, it should give you a pretty good outlook on where your diet is lacking, or where you're getting too much of something. <br>  <br>  You can input your physical activity, too. That will tell you how many calories you need to consume to lose, gain, or maintain your weight. <br>  <br>  A lot of people turn automatically to multivitamins to get energy or feel better, but a) vitamins don't have calories and therefore don't give you energy and b) may not be needed.<br>  <br>  If your diet is missing something, it will tell you what you need. You may just need to eat more of a particular type of food.<br>  <br>  If you see that your nutrient intake is especially low, you can pick a multivitamin that provides what it is exactly that you need. <br>  <br>  Its a nifty little tool and it will give you a great idea of where you stand.|`|T2IzGMU7aa	it is really easy getting all the nutrients you need on a vegy diet but id take these for good measure cause theyll do you alot of good<br>  <br>  Boots - flax seed oil 1050 mg rich in omega 3's gelatin free<br>  Tesco - Calcium + Vitamin D<br>  Online - Seven Seas multi vitamins plus minerals for vegetarians and vegans<br>  <br>  id also go out and get yourself some fake bacon its yummy but ive never tried real bacon|`|WEPtK6ARaa	Protien is probably not your biggest worry,<br>  You need to worry about Iron,<br>  and vitamin B12 wich is only found in animal meat,<br>  But if you eat tofu/soy meats they are usually infused with nutrients,<br>  especially protien and B12,<br>  You should be okay,<br>  but it coulnt help talking to your doctor,|`|6ri7AYC1aa	You can get protein from<br>  Cottage Cheese <br>  Tuna(unless you count fish as a meat)<br>  Tofu<br>  Cheese Pizza<br>  Parmesan Cheese.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if there are vitamins the will give you the protein you need.|`|qbzqx9G2aa	Yes vitamins are definitely good for you ,but i just don't know which won,sorry for mot helping.|`|vJVcfEehaa	Both ,try peanut butter and veggie burgers. they have a lot of protein
8OREBeRdaa	"Taken alcohol" It sounds like a comparison to 'taken drugs'.  Or after chatting with the Dr. "Take 2 alcohols and call me in the morning."<br>  <br>  Ok, seriously.  Yes I have.  I like beer, I like scotch, I like a good martini.  What do I get out of it? Well, I like the way beer tastes, it's texture, it's various flavors and it's character. It also goes well with meals and can be used to enhance food. You can't say the same thing about Dr. Pepper.   Wine also does the same thing.<br>  <br>  Sure I enjoy it!  Why have something if you don't enjoy it?  <br>  <br>  Define often.  I might have one beer a day for 3 days in a row, then there are are other times where I won't have one for weeks.  I might have a glass of wine with a meal that I've painstakingly prepared for friends or guests. I will break out the 18 year old scotch to toast to a specific postiive occasion. <br>  <br>  It's about moderation and the fact that de-alcoholized beer really tastes nasty.|`|ANsznbWsaa	taken alcohol???<br>  <br>  yes I've drank. <br>  The first time just to try it, all the other times because I enjoy it.<br>  I don't drink often.

Naturally ripened purple/black appearing olives contain anthocyanins. This does not include artificially ripened "black olives" that are frequently canned and sent to grocery stores. There is also an effect that typical processing has on the quantity and type of anthocyanins contained in olives".|`|4de3da5babb437b65a9e55c075cdbbdeaa	Well, they're kind of high in fat, but it's a good fat.

a1731418e68343f01ae82b7c12846cf2aa	18 for the simple reason that you have all the other responsibilities of adulthood at 18.  If they don't wan to lower the drinking age, minorship should be raised to 21 (which won't and shouldn't happen).  I think we need to be very strict on drunk driving and do more education about alcohol poisioning.  Because drinking is taboo for kids, it makes them do it hidden, and way more than in Europe where kids sip wine before they even go to school.<br>  <br>  60 Mintues had a good piece about this a few weeks ago.  Many college deans signed a letter stating that the older drinking age isn't working.|`|fMnM01isaa	I think if you old enough to die for your country at war then you should be old enough to go to a bar and by a beer. So either lower the drinking age or raise the military age.|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	I think 19 is perfect. I know teens that are more responsible than some adults. People just need to be responsible when they drink. It's that simple|`|RuntyjmZaa	17! thats when i started drinking at least
0yZrkzizaa	If you can join the army at 18, go to jail for life, and are considered an adult at 18, I do not understand why the drinking age is 21. Granted, I do realize that the number of drinking related deaths have gone down for teenagers since the law was risen from 18 to 21. But, could that also have to do with stricter discipline of drinking and driving? I think it does. Also, the main problem in America isn't whether the age is 18 or 21, it's the way alcohol is perceived by America's youth. In Europe, alcohol is introduced to children at a young age, and they often learn to drink with their parents. And so, when they turn of age (most countries 16-18, Greece doesn't even require an age), binge drinking and getting 'wasted' with friends isn't their top priority. They have learned how to drink alcohol in a socially acceptable manner. Albeit, binge drinking is on the rise in Europe, largely in part to the American attitude infecting the youth in Europe. But anyway, it should be 18, and we should change the way we view drinking. If you can die for this country, why can't you have a beer?|`|CeXKPtCRaa	18 - 18 is when people go to college.  If the drinking age was 18, people would be drinking anyway, but it would be no big deal.  People go to college and get all excited because they have friends that can buy for them and they can go to parties and feel rebellious.  If it was 18, like it used to be (and it actually worked), there would be less binge drinking.  More people would probably go to bars, which would reduce the chance of drinking too much, and it would help generate money and build economy in the area, possibly reducing the price of the college.|`|M6y69Y6gaa	The thing is...<br>  No matter what the legal drinking age is, underagers are gonna get hold of it.<br>  It's annoying when they keep suggesting a higher drinking age. What is it going to solve?|`|YNmBULwDaa	I think the drinking are should be 21 because if they lower it more teens will be drinking and cause more accidents and people who are 21 are more mature|`|x60ULJ5Oaa	21... teaches responsibility..|`|WdW1ga14aa	It should stay at 21.

You are considered an adult at the age of 18, why can't we make that adult decision ourselves. If there are laws that are easy to break. More people will want to be rebellious against them. I think if they lower the drinking age, less people will be irresponsible.|`|GwXJpZWKaa	i think they should switch the drinking and smoking age idk why|`|ThDr2uJBaa	i think it should be 16, because everyone does at that age anyway|`|596N0bRXaa	21 because your brain stops develop at age 21.|`|cTuaFrYiaa	Many years ago the year before I turned 18 the drinking age was lowered to 18 in my State. During this time there was a rise in DWI related accidents and public intoxication. Alcohol was also being served are sold to people as young as 15. The State raised the age back to 21 and it all decreased. From my own life experience I say 21. <br>  <br>  I know the arguments of at 18 I'm an adult, I can vote, and so on. I've been there, done it, and got t-shirt. Those of you answering and voting that are under 21 and saying it should be 18 should consider answering this question again in about 15-20 years. After you have experienced more of life. Hopefully you will not have experienced the loose of a family member or close friend to an alcohol related incident.<br>  <br>  Will say I have to make one exception and that is for those actively serving in the military. If you are out there fighting and dieing for this country then you've earned that right to drink.|`|OxDz2Ympaa	if they higher the drinking age now for all the people who have been drinking legally it will now become illegal.. which is just stupid.<br>  good point made above, if we are allowed to fight in the war and die for out country then why not be allowed a certain drink?!|`|TMk46Pfcaa	It should be 25 because I work in the insurance business, and a lot of the people that are involved in a D.U.I accident are under 21.

The "back bar" or "gantry" is a set of shelves of glasses and bottles behind that counter. In some bars, the gantry is elaborately decorated with woodwork, etched glass, mirrors, and lights.

I've suffered form being underweight all my life. My friends would stare in awe at the crazy amounts of food I could pack away and seemingly loose weight..lol! We had a weight room in my high school and I signed up every marking period. I wouldn't overdo it, but we would do warm up exercises and light aerobics. Then we could use the weights and then we'd cool down. I never "bulked up" just "toned up" really well and that made me look and feel a lot healthier. I put on some weight. My dad tried to get me to drink those "weight gainer" shakes that you at get at GNC but I think they're gross. So, maybe join a gym or get some basic weights for at home. Nothing outrageous.

uWPchd5yaa	I'd stay home and drink|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	Their house, their rules, dude. I don't allow smoking in my house and I smoke. It's just a rule. If you want to smoke, you go outside. There's also a legal issue here. Even if you bring the beer, if you consume beer on their property/in their home and get into an accident on your way home, THEY can be held legally liable, even if they didn't provide the alcohol and you were not above the legal limit. There have been a couple high profile cases here in California where that kind of thing has happened.|`|eYcNsptOaa	If you are 21, then you are old enough to know what respect is.

There is a problem if you're drinking that and want to drive within 6 hours.  You'd be DUI.<br>  <br>  Then it sounds like your friend doesn't own the house.  Even worse, you don't piss off the homeowner.  They'll simply ban your ***.<br>  <br>  Drinking is a privelege, not a right.  Bartenders and liquor store clerks can refuse to sell to legal adults (usually because they are already drunk).  Your friend / friend's family tells you not to drink there they mean if you drink here one more time you won't be allowed back.  <br>  <br>  Here's a brilliant idea, invite your friend over your place.  Apparently you have no problem drinking there and then you don't have to drive and you also don't drink there.  If your friend drinks at your place have the common sense to not let them drive.  Your driving skills really do go downhill even after 2 beers, let alone an entire 40oz.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Sounds like your friends are pretty paranoid. <br>  <br>  First of all, you're drinking 40's? What are you in the ghetto? Buy a respectable six pack and share it with a friend. Three beers will keep you under the legal limit.

If you can't go to your friend's house and enjoy their company for a few hours without drinking a beer, you really don't need to go there anymore.  They are telling you not to bring beer because they know you don't handle it very well, yet they like you.  If you don't see that, then the best thing for both your friends and you is to not go there.  In today's litigious society (that means everyone sues everyone for the dumbest reasons), they are worried that you might get injured or killed when driving home from their home because you were drunk, and then get sued because they didn't stop you.  Go where you can get blitzed and everyone else enjoys getting blitzed.  Don't put your friends in jeapordy.  Maybe someday, you'll come to realize that there's more to life than getting buzzed and then you can go over to your friend's house and not worry about it.l  Sorry, but that's the truth.|`|GSJ9gqVWaa	I don't know how much a '40' is, we don't have that measure in the UK.  You can look up how many units that is on one of the many calculators online.  The general rule is that your liver will dispose of 1 unit an hour of alcohol, but your liver might process it slower, and the figures are slightly lower when you have little alcohol in your system.  In general I would suggest you don't drive with any alcohol in your system at all, it really does slow down your reflexes and make you a worse driver from the first sip.<br>  <br>  As to whether to respect your friends request, I suggest you do as they ask if you want to keep going to their house.  This person obviously doesn't want you to drink when you go and see them.  Whatever their reason, you should respect that.

If u are in your teens or a young adult some people might make comments like that just because when you are young drinking is a sociable thing and most ppl seem to think u should do it lol.

And its quite a sensible idea. i drink a bit but am not keen on getting drunk either.

I know certain folk will find it weird and they don't get it , it's like what you ordering a mineral water for? why don't you have a real drink?  But remember that you don't have to go with the crowd, you don't feel the need for alcohol as a icebreaker or to relax or anything like that, your in control and that's a good thing so just stick to your guns and sooner or later the people round about you will have to accept you for who you are.

hHCdXq0Naa	I thought cordials were alcoholic liqueurs (like Cherry Herring).   Juices in the grocery store will say 100% juice, if they'll all juice.  To confuse you, some labels say 100% Vitamin C, but actually contain about 27% juice (it will say on the label, in small print).  Stay away from any juice that's called a "cocktail" (like cranberry juice cocktail), since they aren't 100% juice|`|TCpWVW4Raa	They are basically exactly the same because you still dilute it, although I think cordials are generally a little bit sweeter because they are going to be mixed with alcohol also|`|RO02uqhnaa	My brother(bartender) says that cordial is the stuff you would never drink straight(rose's lime,grenadine).

jZRtTpZiaa	Hi.  Yes, Dixie Crystals is processed using bone char.  They do not add bone char to the sugar itself, and it's not in the sugar.  But their white sugar is processed using bone char filters.  Here's a good article on sugar and bone char from Vegetarian Journal.  <a href="http://www.vrg.org/journal/vj2007issue4/VJ4_2007-Sugar.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.vrg.org/journal/vj2007issue4/...</a><br>  <br>  The easiest way to avoid bone char in the US is to buy organic sugar.  Not all white sugar is processed using bone char.   Read that article for more info.<br>  <br>  **edit:  The reason I know Dixie Crystals uses bone char is because their own company website states it.  ;)    <a href="http://dixiecrystals.com/fw/main/Frequently-Asked-Questions-1302.html" rel="nofollow">http://dixiecrystals.com/fw/main/Frequen...</a>   Bone char filters  are very much still in use.

Brown sugar is usually simply white sugar of the same quality as they would otherwise sell, with molasses added.  Does that sound vegan?  I know several vegans and they won't eat anything with sugar, brown or white, unless they know the brand does not involve bone char.

71h39Q5faa	I went to Party City to get supplies to make gifts for a baby shower and I was amazed at all the things they had for retirement parties.<br>  <br>  Hats, t-shirts, bottle bottom glasses, dinnerware (plates, napkins, cups, etc.), balloons,<br>  <br>  Also you can buy plastic dentures, those denture cleaning tablets, key chains, wall plaques, t-shirts, balloons, balloon holders, plastic  visors, readers (glasses) and embossing pens at a dollar store.<br>  <br>  If you find something cool use the gold or silver pens to write some "insulting" phrase on it.  You can also emboss glitter onto any object that can withstand the heat gun (or your blowdryer).  If you buy t-shirts from the dollar store or at Michael's, AC Moore etc, you can get t-shirt printer paper for about ten bucks and write up something specific to the individual(s), print it on a regular printer and iron it on.  You get 8-10 sheets and if you only use half you will have 16-20 iron on sheets.  They have iron on patches with expressions on them too. (old fart, he's my old fart, old farting together, lol).<br>  <br>  The flip flops are great as are big hawaiian shirts, big baggy boxers or baggy pants with an elastic waste (long or short).<br>  <br>  Also check out oriental trading.  They are an inexpensive place to get different party theme items from.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Get one of those remote controls with the really huge light-up buttons.<br>  <br>  A bag of dried prunes would also be funny.|`|L2tQ7t6Faa	Depends diapers, whoopy cushion.

jlZYl8NDaa	Because the world is so in love with coffee, the workers that make the coffee are being exploited by large corporations. Basically, they work very labor-intensive jobs and they don't get paid a fair day's wage. Its difficult for them to feed their family and they are often very impoverished. <br>  <br>  Fair trade coffee is around to prevent the exploitation of those farmers and workers. When you buy fair trade coffee, you are guaranteeing that all involved in the production of the coffee are receiving a fair day's wage. <br>  <br>  Also, fair trade coffee producers frequently use agricultural practices that are safer for the environment. A fair trade label does not necessarily mean that the coffee is eco-friendly, but the chances of it being so are much higher.<br>  <br>  Often the price is not much higher (if at all) than regular coffee, and you can feel good that you're not supporting the starvation of the hard working farmer that produced your coffee.|`|1K8NPRUOaa	it means that the coffee is actual stuff that was grown and there was nothing added and it is organic stuff made fresh and is supposed to be a whole lot healtheir for you.

nDxfUHFLaa	it depends on the fruit used.<br>  In your example you used strawberries. When you defrost them the structure of the strawberry collapses and what you get are red soft objects. I doubt however that this would affect whether the Guinea pigs would eat them. they would. If you have a food container to catch the juice then it will work.<br>  <br>  Many times when you freeze fruits the water separates out of the fruit when you thaw it. So its not quite like having raw fruit.<br>  melons pieces seem to hold up. Berries dont hold up. Apples bananas turn brown. But do freeze well.|`|9jCP4STQaa	no cuz it well get freezeer brurt and that is not good

DT2mU1jOaa	Yes but I will say it again only real beers made with real fruit. With very few exceptions I will only drink Kriek & Framboise beers from Belgium when the situation calls for them. First these beers have a great history behind them. They also stand up well with foods even (few beers do) desserts as the guy mentioned. But they are classic beers made in a class all by themselves. The are natural and not a syrup-added artificial beer so common today.|`|7ntSRsZLaa	Ehh not really.<br>  I stick to either beer, or harder stuff like rum, whiskey, and vodka.<br>  Jamican Rum= Best drunk you'll ever have ;)|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	I do!

It could be bad and not even smell.  Good luck!
YupMCYHlaa	Keep them in a sealed jar or re-seal the bag.  Air is not bad for them, it makes them go stale.   You can keep them in the fridge, but I don't think that really helps that much.

I have thought for many years that the driving age should be at least 18, which should take care of a lot of youth deaths in drunk driving, or plain driving accidents.  I do also think that the drinking age should be contingent on things like having finished high school.  If you are 18-20 and still in HS, then you shouldn't be drinking.  It would be more to patrol (like having mandatory state issued ID cards with certain colored backgrounds), but I believe it would be worth it.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	YES.     If kids learn to drink in moderation then drinking never takes on any kind of mystery or wonder to them.

Alcohol has no mystery, no fascination to her - it's just a glass of wine, same as it is for me.    It's annoying to take her to an Italian restaurant and not be able to let her have some chianti, or a few sips of sake at a sushi bar, and share the cultural experience.<br>  <br>  The fact that some people can't handle it shouldn't preclude those who can from enjoying themselves.|`|GLdBmoo7aa	Age to Drink Milk: 0-4<br>  Age to Drink Milk & water :4-6<br>  Age to Drink Complain: 6-16<br>  Age to Drink Coffee/Tea : 16-26<br>  Age to Drink Cool Drinks : 26-36<br>  Age to Drink Above all : 36-56<br>  Age to Drink Tonics : 56-76<br>  Age to Drink Soups(bcz of no teeth): 76-96<br>  Age to Drink......................................|`|7ntSRsZLaa	The kids who wanna drink, these days are gonna get the alcohol one way or another anyways.<br>  If it was legal for them to drink...it might not be as "fun."<br>  Or maybe the other way around, it would cause problems..<br>  I dont know..

You can drink wine at 12 in France but they set up drink as a social thing that can be enjoyed outside of the pub and club scene.

aNlT1NRqaa	To make the foamed milk all you need is a pot & a whisk. Put 2% milk or half and half into the pot & put the pot in the freezer (the milk needs to be real cold). After about 10 minutes there should be a little ice forming around the edge (now you're ready).<br>  <br>  Put the pan on the stove with medium-high heat. Whisk briskly. You should see relatively big bubbles form. As you whisk & it heats up, the bubbles will shrink to fine foam. If you have a thermometer, heat it, while whisking, to 140-160 degrees F. If you don't, just dip your finger in until it feels really hot (not enough to burn you).

pMFLqU0Yaa	For the home cook I'd bet a lot of money it's the exact same type I make at my house all the time - whatever is lurking about the kitchen with one, two or even three types of cheese, complimentary spices and a cream or whole milk and egg custard in a butter crust.  <br>  <br>  Quiche is one of those dishes where there are not any "right" ingredients. Think of it like a kitchen sink casserole. You add whatever leftovers or odds and ends you have that you want to use. The only real constant in a nice, rich quiche is 1 egg for every 1/2 Cup milk or cream. I usually use 4 eggs and 2 cups of cream for my 9" deep dish pie plate. <br>  <br>  I make quiche every other day, at least. Depending on how many people are here for breakfast, I may make two or even three of them! My Gran is crazy for quiche, so I always have to keep one made. The one I made today has crisp, crumbled bacon, leftover cubed rotisserie chicken and sauteed sliced mushrooms, onions and garlic. Then I used a mix of half cheddar and half swiss for the cheese. I made one the other day with cooked, crumbled sausage, sauteed onion and green pepper and used a mix of cheddar and monterey jack cheeses. The one before that (told you I made a lot of quiche) used sauteed onion, garlic and grated zucchini with crisp, crumbled bacon and a mix of fresh grated parmesan, monterey jack and cheddar.  <br>  <br>  One of the most popular quiches by far - well, according to my personal observations anyway - is Quiche Lorraine. I've noticed just plain ol' cheese quiche is popular, too. At least those are the ones I see on restaurant menus most often. Like I said, tho, they can have anything you want in them!|`|AA11610779	The most popular French quiche is indeed the Quiche Lorraine. I know, I'm French. That's the most typical one.

For example, if it calls for 1 tsp, then instead of a level teaspoon, try filling the teaspoon slightly less full of the ground version to account for the minuscule spacing between that would have been the whole seeds.

The actually use it in some countries to induce miscarriage's<br>  <br>  More info:<br>  If you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, avoid eating papaya or using a papaya product. Papaya is sometimes recommended for soothing indigestion, which is a common ailment during pregnancy. Although a fully ripe papaya is not considered dangerous, a papaya that is at all unripe contains a latex substance that triggers uterine contractions and may cause a miscarriage. 1 <br>  <br>  The papaya enzyme that helps soothe indigestion is called papain, or vegetable pepsin. Papain is found in the fruit's latex and leaves. 1 Researchers have noted that unripe papaya latex acts like prostaglandin and oxytocin, which the body makes to start labor. 2 Synthetic prostaglandin and oxytocin are commonly used to start or strengthen labor contractions."|`|bn8OZrYSaa	yeah they are better that way|`|rftEZA50aa	fregnant? lmaooo...Sorry I gotto laugh.

f7a3aa193e6ef1599fd1586194b788e4aa	The tightly rolled up deep fried shredded chicken tacos suggestion, sound just like the perfect thing. Make plenty of them, drain really well, stack together in a big airtight container. They are best served with cream, salsa and some salt. Some people add guacamole, but guacamole needs either milk or lemon juice to keep it from turning dark. These tacos are known as tacos de pollo, or chicken tacos. You might like to add some pico de gallo or rooster's beak (don′t ask me where the name came from, that is what they call it) It involve finely chopped tomato, onion and cilantro all mixed together, which stand for the colors of the Mexican flag, green, white and red. For those adventurous enough, chop some fresh serrano peppers or chiles on the side. Fresh is good because it does not irritate your stomach the way canned ones do. If you decide to chop them, be sure to wear rubber gloves, the capsicum oil in the seeds clings to your fingertips and believe me, you do not want that on your skin or eyes by mistake. The Pico de Gallo can be best described as a type of dry salsa. In Mexico it is spooned onto many dishes in place of regular salsa.<br>  A secret to the great taste of Mexican food is the use of fresh ingredients over processed, canned, bottled or dehydrated ones.<br>  <br>  Mexican desserts could be bu?uelos, which are deep fried flour tortillas, covered in granulated sugar and cinnamon. They keep very well, but are rather fragile. They do not need to be heated either.<br>  The so called Mexican Wedding Cookies or Cakes, are something I've never ever eaten or seen, and I've been living in Mexico for over thirty years. Sometimes I wonder why that recipe keeps popping up.<br>  <br>  Sorry to burst your bubble, but burritos are nowhere near Mexican, they are 100% American. California and some other Southwestern states are fighting over who thought it up first.<br>  A tacada does not exist, a taquiza does, which is a self serve taco buffet. Not a good idea for a project because it involves a lot of work and heating up.<br>  <br>  Now that you will be doing a presentation on Mexico, be sure to set the record straight. Offensive and ignorant Hollywood stereotypes that must be avoided when thinking of Mexico:<br>  Mexican music does not mean Spanish guitar, maracas and castanets<br>  No bullfights (yes they are somewhat popular, but Spain beats Mexico at that)<br>  Olé! is something you would say in Spain or a Bullfight, definitely not in Mexico<br>  Spanish is the official language<br>  Mexico and Spain are two different countries in two different continents, they share a common root language, but Mexican Spanish is different from Castillian Spanish, just like American English is different from Brit English.<br>  Burritos and fajitas are not Mexican foods<br>  Not all Mexicans are ignorant, poor, uneducated immigrant wannabees<br>  Not all Mexicans are drug dealers, druglords, corrupt or evil<br>  Mexico is a great country with a terrible legacy of corruption (many think they need it to get ahead in life) and some of the worst politicians in the world.<br>  Mexicans in general are good people who have never had a chance.<br>  <br>  Good Luck on your project.|`|6MYSKK1laa	What about those little tacitos that are rolled and fried (I guess).

tt3NqROGaa	1. Animals would most likely not overpopulate, as most food animals are bred for the purpose of eating. If any species is going to have an overpopulation problem, it's humans, as we require more resources than most species.<br>  <br>  2. Yes, there are humane ways to kill animals, but many farms do not use these methods and instead opt to bludgeon/exsanguinate animals. <br>  <br>  3. I am not dogmatic with my veganism.<br>  <br>  4. People don't want to put those laws into place because they would cost money, the majority of people don't care about the animals they eat.<br>  <br>  5. Abortion is okay in certain situations, I am strongly against third trimester abortions/partial abortion, as those are just sickening. However, if a pregnancy poses a risk to the woman's life, the baby can't survive if the mother dies. Therefore, you may as well save one instead of killing both.<br>  <br>  Also, If a child is going to be born with a condition where it will not live for more than a few months: certain types of Osteogenesis Imperfecta and Spina Bifida, Infantile Tay-Sachs et cetera... then the parents may as well be spared the emotional anguish of losing a child soon after its birth. But if a woman is irresponsible and sleeping around, she should not be permitted to have an abortion. <br>  <br>  Those are my beliefs on the subject.|`|PPBP6AGDaa	Firstly - I agree with you on abortion and am pro choice and vegan. I have respect for ALL life.<br>  <br>  Your first question about how if we all stopped eating meat then the animals would kill us etc...that would never, ever happen because it would never, ever happen that everyone stopped eating meat overnight. Any changes are very gradual, and farmers change the amount of animals they breed according to the demand that is provided. <br>  <br>  I don't judge people who eat meat, and I'm not one to go up to someone eating meat and start telling them how horrible their eating habits are etc. If they respect me for being vegan, I respect their choice to eat meat - but if they asked me, I would explain why I thought of it as wrong.<br>  Having said that - I fully support people having their own chickens and taking (SOME) of the eggs. I fully support people buying their own cows, raising them, and then butchering them humanely. Do I like it? NO! But people are going to eat meat, and if I had to choose between a cow that had been raised lovingly by a family and a cow that had the factory farm life....the choice is obvious.<br>  <br>  Good questions you raised, hope my answer gave some food for thought.|`|JNAyyZRMaa	im a vegetarian tho, it doesnt feel n e different and when i sit down w/ my friends 2 eat at lunch i dont like punch them coz they eat meat<br>  i still think that sport fishing iz CRUEL they dont even eat the poor little fish!!!!!!!!!!!! EWWWWW Y DO PPL DO THIZ!!!!!!!!!!!|`|BNnhs3QOaa	Go to www.meat.org and watch the video. Its horrible how they kill the animals. If all the people in the world did not eat meat, than all the animals would get eaten by other bigger, animals.|`|jZRtTpZiaa	Food chain?  The animals you speak of are removed from any chain and are in total captivity as domesticated animals.  You have overlooked that if all of humankind was so committed to extend their compassion to not eating animals,  which by the way isn't going to happen any time soon, that they could also control a population that is already under their control.   Many of these animals already have their testicles removed. Cows are artificially inseminated.   These animals would kill us?  Cows? Chickens?  Pigs? Would kill us?  Under what scenario do you seriously see a chicken eating you?   Are you kidding me?  I have a neighbor with a pet bull who eats apples out of my hand.  He's as much a vegetarian as I am. Their population is extreme already because they are made to feed an overpopulation of human beings which could more efficiently be served by a plants-based diet.  Over 15,000 children in the world  die every single day from hunger, and malnutrition while grain crops are feeding an overpopulation of farm animals in order that they may overfeed relatively wealthy people.   Those children will never have to worry about your overpopulation of animals eating them hypothesis.   A vegetarian diet -- or even a diet that includes much smaller amounts of meat than people are stuffing down their throats-- uses less water resources, less land resources, can feed more people, has less of a negative environmental impact, and costs a hell of a lot less to produce.  If we could get vegetarian food to where it needs to go, it would feed many, many times more people than a diet that includes meat. <br>  <br>  Abortion and food and animal rights have nothing to do with one another.  There are many people who eat meat who are pro choice as well.    And there are many vegetarians who are also against abortion.|`|oRPvkExwaa	I really don't think diet and abortion are related. Personally, I'm a vegetarian, and have been since I was 3 years old, back then I'm sure I chose this lifestyle because I loved animals, now it's more of a frame of mind, eating meat just isn't appealing to me. But I don't force my beliefs on others, nor does it bother me to be around people eating meat, I can even prepare food with meat, I just choose not to eat it. I'm also pro-choice. There are a lot of circumstances surrounding a woman's choice to abort a fetus, such as age, health, financial capabilities... I don't honestly believe that there's anyone who thinks abortions are right or should be used as a form of birth control, but they might be what's right for that woman, at that time.<br>  <br>  Also, I don't really think it's a matter of the fetus deserving to live more than animals. The fetus can't survive outside the womb. And as you mentioned with animals, overpopulation is an issue. Imagine how it would be if every crackhead  alcoholic mother, or teenager, or rape victim, or even just single women, had children they would have otherwise aborted. Adoption agencies would be even more strained and more and more single parent homes would live in poverty. The government would have to shell out more in welfare, etc etc...

The water should be about 95 to 115° F.

Continue mixing until a shaggy dough begins to form. Clean off paddle and switch to dough hook. Continue mixing on low until the dough comes together.<br>  <br>  Increase speed to medium and knead for eight minutes.<br>   The dough should completely clear the sides and bottom within 2 minutes if it is too sticky, add additional flour 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing in thoroughly before determining if more flour is needed.<br>  <br>   If the dough seems too dry, spritz with water from a spray bottle a couple of times, mixing in thoroughly before determining if more water is needed. continue kneading for 6 minutes. <br>  You'll find the dough wraps itself around the hook, so every 2 minutes, stop the machine, scrape the dough off the hook, and then continue kneading.<br>  <br>  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it a few more times by hand to be sure it's tight and elastic. <br>  Form the dough into a tight ball.<br>  <br>  Wash and dry your mixing bowl then mist it with oil. <br>  Place the dough, seam-side down, in the bowl and lightly mist top of dough with baking spray.<br>   Cover bowl with plastic wrap and allow to rise (ferment) in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in size — 45 minutes to an hour.<br>  <br>  Punch the dough down and transfer to a lightly floured board.<br>   Knead for about half a minute, then reshape into a ball. <br>  Respray bowl lightly, return dough to bowl, spray, recover, and allow to rise again until doubled in bulk — an hour to an hour and a half. <br>  <br>  Heat the oven to 450F (230C).<br>  <br>  Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide into two equal portions. Set 1 aside and cover with plastic wrap to keep it from drying out. Shape the other portion into a round by hand.<br>  <br>  Place the rolling pin in the center of the round and push outward. Rotate the dough 1/4 turn and repeat. <br>  Continue until dough is about 12 inches across.<br>   Alternatively, you can stretch the dough by hand. <br>  The dough is quite elastic and will want to shrink, so don't rush it. <br>  <br>  Pause every now and then while shaping (whether by hand or with a rolling pen) to allow the dough to relax.<br>  <br>  Coat with sauce, cheese, and toppings.<br>   Then, ideally, let the pizzas stand, covered with plastic wrap, for about 30 minutes before baking. <br>  This delay highlights the bready character of the dough.<br>  <br>   Before baking, use a knife to poke holes in any noticable bubbles.|`|WhpaJBpEaa	My aunty is italian and she knows all!!!!!<br>  <br>  her recipe is:<br>  -2 tbs per person of flour<br>  -a drizzle of oil<br>  -salt<br>  -warm water<br>   do not use yeast!!!!!!!!!|`|AA10681117	Yes, the instant yeast is fine.

Okay, then, how come we cannot have euthanasia or assisted suicide?  It is all very complicated.  Better not to kill animals and then be very able to condemn killing on all levels and with all species, including our own)  <br>  <br>  This line of thought will carry you to the debate about capital punishment (lethal injection is considered to be more compassionate than other forms of execution)|`|jlZYl8NDaa	They're asking if there are any good anime movies that involve people turning into animals, or animals turning into people.|`|VquZAwfHaa	What exactly are you asking?
