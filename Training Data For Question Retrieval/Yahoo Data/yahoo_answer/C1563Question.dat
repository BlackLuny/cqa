I understand it'll be uncomfortable but for a 500 mile trip I can manage that. Is it relatively safe?      I'm a pretty low-maintenance traveler so I'm not picky.       Also, how soon before the bus departure do you need to get at the station? Do you have to check in like you do for a flight? How does it work?      How often do the buses stop? Can you have food and drink on the bus?       Any advice or insight is appreciated. Don't tell me to consider another form of transportation; this is my only option so just tell me what to expect.      Thanks!

20090202215514AA8IDTq	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Israel	Rabbi Hersh Lowenthal: The State of Israel has as much to do with Judaism as does New Zealand or Zimbabwe?	The Zionist ideology is antithetical to the Torah. Zionism was deviously designed to replace the Torah and its holy, God-given commandments with nationalistic, power-driven ideals that are devoid of holiness, godliness, or spirituality.      God-fearing Jews believe that the ultimate Redemption of the Jewish Nation will come about only through the Hand of God, and that at the time of the Redemption, peace will reign in the entire world. Any other type of forced redemption is but a sinful transgression, condemned by Hashem and His Holy Torah.      What more proof does one need than the fact that for centuries, Jews have lived peacefully in Arabic countries, enjoying the respect and friendship of their neighbors? The tragedy of Zionism changed all of that. The painful truth is that in the eyes of the Zionist government, Jews are merely the cannon-fodder needed for the 'State of Israel' to achieve its agenda, to the point that the Zionists collaborated with the Nazis to deny safety and life to many European Jews, so that the cause of the (Not) Jewish State could be forwarded.      Thoughts? Reactions? Thoughtful answers preferred.
