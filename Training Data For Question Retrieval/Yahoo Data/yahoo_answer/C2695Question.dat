Assim como o Orkut para humanos, o espa?o virtual voltado para animais tem como objetivo colocar donos e seus bichos em contato. Cachorros, papagaios, tartarugas, gatos, insetos, peixes e até bichos de pelúcia podem ter sua página pessoal e participar de comunidades.      A idéia é dos amigos Fernando Bortolato e Alexandre Domingues, declaradamente apaixonados por pets.      "O Petkurt é uma grande comunidade para quem se preocupa com o bem estar do seu pet. Sempre me amarrei em animais, e achei que essa seria uma oportunidade legal dos donos se conhecerem e trocarem informa??es. A inten??o é que os participantes se tornem uma grande família", explica Bortolato.      O cadastramento é gratuito e o animal ganha um perfil com espa?o para fotos, tra?os da personalidade, família, amigos e muito mais.       No Petkurt também é possível trocar informa??es, dicas e denunciar abusos e maus tratos. O site ainda oferece espa?o para anúncio de pets perdidos e memorial para animais mortos.

We are not and can't go to an obedience class. Its very bad when we come home, she nips us and jumps all over the place. We need it to stop!!! But one of my big questions is that I heard a method for the nipping. Everyone said to "yelp" and scream really loud when the dog nips you. But won't that show them you are lower in rank, and weaker than them? So how can we get her to stop jumping up on us and nipping us??

He is 1 years old and 5-6months old.   looks healthy like a horse plays normal, eats normal, drinking normal.         i do have some antibiotics that i got not to long ago from my vet because my other ferret tonsils were large.       maybe that could help? well what i think might be the problem is that he might of had ate hes kibble food to fast and hurt himself?      i would appreciate a great answer not just saying go to the vet   thanks.

20090203133654AAjMc4h	Pets;Birds	Is my african grey congo sick?	Last night i saw my African Grey Congo (Its only about 3 months) sleeping on the bottom of its cage. Well it wasn't really sleeping, but it was sitting on the corner ready to sleep. Now, I fed it formula, but now We are feeding it seeds and fruit. I think it is very healthy because he eats his fruits and vegetables every day. But that whole day we gave it attention and it seemed fine, it was walking around and climbing on its cage. And it was also sitting on his perch. Today, he also seems fine. The day before this happened he was sleeping on his perch,      So is my congo sick? It only did this once and my African Grey congo seems healthy. And I know they can hide sickness well, but it only did this once and that was the only sign of sickness i think.       Please help!

He had another owner for about 4-5 days but she ended up being very allergic. The previous owners said the puppy was doing great on the training, I even saw him go out and pee/poo while I was there. I just brought him back to my place and let him out twice but he did nothing. He just peed on the carpet and then we found poo. We have been watching him the whole time, not sure how he even did it! I put a soiled napkin outside along with the poop so he can smell his own stuff out there and hopefully go.      Just wondering how we can get him back on track. Is this normal because the dog is in a new place? Should we crate him and just let him be in the same room as us?      Advice much appreciated.

20090225012711AA1paWO	Pets;Dogs	Does my dog need to go the vet for minor cuts that I cleaned with alcohol?	My dog was either in a fight (most likely) or got cut on some rocks or glass.  The cuts aren't deep enough to need stitches and I cleaned them with hydrogen peroxide and then rubbing alcohol (i figure better safe than sorry).  If I was employed I would not hesitate to take him the vet, I love my dog, but my financial situation is not good at all and if it is reasonable to assume that he should be fine since I cleaned the cuts well and he is up to date on his rabies and other shots/vaccinations then I really need to not spend the money.  I know cats always need to go if they get in a cat fight but I'm not sure about dogs, he's never been in a fight before. Like I said the cuts aren't that deep but he was bleeding in a couple places where it appears he was bitten by another dog.  The only other possibility would be if someone actually shot him with a shotgun to get him away from their dog or them.. he has about 4-6 cuts, and are about 'bird-shot-pellet' size, but since they are all on one of his front legs, I'd imagine a dog got hold of his leg with his jaws... help please...please put yourself in my position if you are financially well-off.. just imagine loving your dog as much as possible, but having extremely limited funds..

20090224161736AAKlS66	Pets;Cats	My cat won't eat, drink, pee, poop, and is not acting normal?	My kitten Nermal is roughly 6-7 months old and for the last five days he will not eat or drink. I've been force feeding him baby good with proteins and giving him a calorie supplement from the pet store but as of last night he just throws the food we get down him (which isnt much) back up. He's normally extremely active and loves food of all types but now he just lays around. It seems like someone sucked his will to live out of him. He hasn't poop that i can tell for the last few days and he pees extremely little amounts maybe one time a day. He hasn't been cleaning his coat either. But he's shown no signs of a fever, his nose has been cold and sometimes wet and every now and then i can get a faint purr out of him.  I know most of the answers to this are take him to the vet but i can't afford to, i've called and tried everything i can. it's killing me to watch him waste away but i don't know what to do.      also, a few weeks ago on his right eye underneath his pupal was a brown like cloudy spot and it recently went away and i never could figure out what it was.       if someone could please help me that would be amazing!

20090224164944AAWCwnY	Pets;Cats	Why does my cat prefer my closet rather than the litter box in the winter?	My cat is about nine years old and for the last two winters, he's taken up my closet as his new litter box. I tried cleaning his litter box twice a week instead of just once, but it hasn't made a difference. This only happens in the winter, so it may have something to do with him not wanting to go through the snow (he's an indoor/outdoor cat), but this has never bothered him in the past. I have two other cats besides him, and neither of them have this problem. Any help?
20090224165438AAAnq0t	Pets;Cats	Cat collars are dangerous.?	I always thought cat collars were cute and harmless.  Tonight my 6 month old cat came into the kitchen, his mouth and paws covered in blood!  Scared me to death.  I discovered that his SafeCat breakaway collar was stuck in his mouth and he had ripped out multiple teeth trying to get it off!!!  Took him to the vet and the vet said they were all baby teeth, but what if they hadn't been?  And even when you lose baby teeth, they don't bleed uncontrollably.  I feel absolutely horrible and I know this isn't a question, as much as a conversation starter or a warning, but I just wanted everyone to be cautious of cat collars.  I will never use one again.  (I have a 5 year old cat who has always worn one - never had any trouble.  She will not be wearing one anymore either).  Unless your cat goes outside, please do not use these collars.

20090224191422AAFuanT	Pets;Cats	Eco friendly cat care?	Hi everyone!      I am currently working on a newsletter for the vet clinic where I work and was looking for quick input. The theme is "Going Green: Eco friendly pet tips" and will cover natural foods, biodegradable litter, composting, and other environmentally friendly products on the market for pet care. Any suggestions on what you do to promote a green pet (cat, dog, fish, pocket pet, horse, anything!) would be greatly appreciated. I just recieved the assignment today and would love to hear from as many of you as possible as soon as possible.       Tell me what you do to go green. Even if it just using recycled materials, I would love to hear and share your suggestions (with your permission - so if you post, it may be published, so by posting here you are giving permission!) with our community, staff, and clientele.      Also - is there one big area of focus you are interested in as pet owners? While the major article will focus on tips in general, I have a secondary and tertiary article to address a particular area of eco friendly pet care in depth. What specific themes would you (as a pet owner) want to know more about? Would you rather read more about natural diets, grooming, waste disposal, specific products.. etc?       Thank you in advanced for all of your ideas and input. If any of you are interested in reading the final product, let me know and I will link you to it (it is posted online as well).       Just as a note so no one gets upset - I will be posting this question under general pet, dogs, and cats to make sure I can recieve a wider range of answers!

I have one son that lives with me full time (16yrs old) and a son (15yrs) who is only with me part time.  Anyways Zeus for some unknown reason doesnt appear to like my visiting son very much.  I introduced them like i would if he was a stranger given he doesnt live with me full time.  My son hasnt done anything to the dog.  Well the dog lunged at my son and left a scratch on his hip.  Then we tried the re introduction thing, the dog was friendly and even started to kiss him on the face only to lunge at him again 3hrs later.  I truly dont understand this behavior given he doesnt do anything like that to myself, my husband or my 16yr old.  He also absolutely despises company over.  Any help on this situation would be greatly appreciated.  I really truly dont want to give up on Zeus :(

20090224214302AAz6Yzw	Pets;Fish	Bubble Eye and Red Cap Oranda?	I did something very stupid and bought a bubble eye and a red cap oranda (I think) on Sunday without knowing anything about keeping fish. I'm trying to research everything and I'm getting overwhelmed.       I have the two in the largest bowl I could find in my house, about two gallons. Today I changed the water and added some AquaSafe water conditioner. I ended up replacing half of the water because my bubble eye was gasping at the surface. Now he seems to be fine.    I checked the levels and everything is in decent range except for the pH and Alkalinity. Also I think the hardness levels are a little low (very soft according to chart). Is hardness related to pH levels?       I really want to keep these fish, but I also want them to be healthy and happy. I found a twenty gallon tank that I may buy, but my research leads me to believe that I need a thirty gallon. If I buy the tank and a filter and everything, is it likely that my fish will survive the "cycling" process?

I go to dog training at least once a week so the dog will become perfectly social.      I'm looking at maybe a Basenji or a Shiba Inu.    What dog breed would be best for me?

20090203141136AAAYXSv	Pets;Other - Pets	Why is my Rabbit hurting himself?	I got a bunny a little over a week ago and he sleeps in his cage while I'm at work, but spends most of the time outside of it when I'm home. I always leave the door open so he can go in and eat his food and do his business. I was off work today and when I got up, I went into the living room where he was, and all of a sudden, he started running around his cage erratically and smashing his face into the bars! He did this about 10 times and I finally opened the cage door and he ran out and hid for about 20 minutes. He seems to have come around, except for the fact that he runs from me if I'm walking around. I haven't been able to lock him back into his cage because if he's in it and I approach him, he darts out. Has anyone ever heard of this behaviour before? I called the pet store where I purchased him, they called their veterinarian and no one has heard of this kind of behaviour with rabbits. Please help!

20090225020721AAwuni8	Pets;Cats	Raising a kitten, some general questions...?	Well, my kitten is now about 5 months old. We've had her for 3 months now, and she's just adorable. However, there are a few questions that I've had.      1) She is licking everyone in my family's faces/necks/lips/teeth nonstop! She looooooves it and purrs like a little engine while she's doing it. Why? Should I encourage her, or try to teach her not to. Is this a stage?      2) She also loves biting when she gets playful. I figure this is pretty normal behavior for a kitten. I like to encourage her by offering my hand to her stomach for her to claw/bite to death, but I imagine this may become painful once she's an adult. Should I discourage biting while playing while she's a kitten?      3) Moody, moody! She goes from being ridiculously playful to the biggest cuddler to the soundest sleeper. Will this continue into adulthood? How much do kittens' personalities change?      4) Soft paws! I bought some Soft Claws for kittens, but I just can't get them to stay on. They're also way too big... seems like the kitten size should fit a 5 month old kitten! Also, if anyone has a brilliant strategy for getting the damned things on, I'd love to hear it!      5) Walking her. I recently bought a harness and leash, as I figured she might enjoy going outside once in awhile (She's obviously a housecat). She doesn't seem to enjoy it much... especially when cars come! Should I keep taking her out every now and then and see if she gets used to it, then take her exploring the neighborhood?      6) Catnip. She doesn't respond at all; I know that some cats simply don't. Is she too young, or is it likely that she doesn't get euphoric off of catnip?      7) She acts very strangely sometimes. She'll put her paws up on the walls and look back at me, run to another wall and do the same thing, etc. Sometimes she acts feral! Is this to be expected, with all their pent up energy or whatever?      8) Any tips or things I should be doing/looking for? Thanks!

He's pretty much coughed up all over my bed and floor (they always sleep with me) and has been mostly coughing up white saliva. They're both labrador/dalmation mixed breeds, he's six years old. I have no idea what's wrong, he hasn't been on his monthly heart worm meds for only 2 months b/c of temporary financial reasons and I also had fed him late at 1:00 tonight because I was really busy all day. I would think if he cought something his sister would've cought it too, but he's been quiet now for 15 minutes just laying down on a towel next to me, and he seems ok.  Should I take him to the vet, does he need anything what's going on with him?????

20090225023055AAOaIyd	Pets;Cats	I found a white colored worm crawl out of my (7wko)kitten's anus! It doesnt look like roundworm, what is it?	Ok, so I was snuggling with my kitten(she's about 7 weeks), who loves to have her belly rubbed. As she was lying there I noticed something white-ish crawl out of her anus. At first I thought it was a thick piece of string or something, but then I realised that it was moving and it compressed itself into a blob and then stretched out into the stringy shape. I have been looking worms up online, but I have no idea what it is. It doesnt look like roundworm because it was much smaller and it came out of the kitty's anus not after it threw up. I paid $75 to the rescue shelter where I got my kitten from because it has been "dewormed and given it's flea treament". Is this normal, could this word be a lone, runaway fugitive worm or does it have a colony? I can't sleep I'm so grossed out that I feel like there are worms crawling all over me because I was snuggling with her....could I contract any diseases? Help, I need somebody, not just anybody.
