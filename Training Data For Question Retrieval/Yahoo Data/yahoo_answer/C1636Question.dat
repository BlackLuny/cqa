I do not support this at all. I fully support Jerusalem of being Israel's capital from the days of old so I am just wondering what are your plans to stop this Palestine madness of becoming part of Jerusalem? Israel is God's nation and he hates people that divide His land, and the Wrath of God will fall upon them who do. God will give to who ever He chooses to give His land away to, and He chose the Jewish people. Remember this life is on loan, and nothing belongs to anyone but God after all He created everything so everything belongs to Him. Not a mere mortal. so anyway what are you Israelis going to do about the Palestine situation? will you go to war with them again? and when?

20090308044618AArsLLw	Travel;United States;New York City	New York SOL on Judgments?	I had a Judgment entered in Feb of 1989. It has expired and was never renewed. I started making voluntary payments last July when I first became aware of this debt although I did not remember it and they would not validate it. They had an order for garnishment which was not filed as long as I made payments. I have since changed employers.    Question: Since the sol expired and they never renewed it and I have changed employers, can they seek another order?   Any help would be appreciated.   I honestly never knew about this debt until 20 years latter. It never affected my FICO. I think someone used my card. The original debt was under $1,000 and not with interest they want $63,00 plus
20090308044300AA3pTPm	Travel;Asia Pacific;Korea	How do I make Korean friends?	This is a little complicated, but bear with me please!      Okay - I'm 100% Korean biologically, but I was born in America so I am basically American, not Korean. But I'd really like to get to know the culture and language better. I attend college and there are a lot of Koreans here, but I don't know how to make friends with them. I always see them hanging out in groups all speaking Korean together and that discourages me because my Korean is not very good at all.      I'm willing to suck up the embarrassment and try to speak Korean more, but can someone tell me how I make Korean friends? I mean if I was in class sitting next to a Korean wouldn't it be weird to turn and say "Anyonghaseyo!"? Or maybe I could say like "Wow that exam yesterday was difficult..." or do Koreans normally say this when meeting new people?      I understand I'm too Americanized for a Korean, but please give me some advice! Thanks!

It doesn't matter to me whether I work in Carrolton, Denton, Lewisville, or Dallas. I can't keep my job search restricted to Denton.       I don't know if I'm reading the schedule incorrectly or what, but which is the best route to take FROM Denton in the morning & then get BACK to Denton DCTA Connect bus station by around 6 PM?       It looks like, from what I'm reading on the schedule, the buses either leave Denton & then come back the NEXT day, or something else. I'm confused & not understanding. I'm afraid to be stuck out in Dallas, or wherever, overnight. & I'm afraid that if I get off @ the Denton Park & Ride in the evening, I'll be stuck because the #1 bus (DCTA connect) would have stopped running already. They stop early.        Basically, I just want to know how I can commute from Denton to Dallas, Lewisville, or Carrolton in the morning & get back to Denton DCTA connect station by 6 PM, so I can get home securely.

I'd appreciate your advice on nice places to go.....hikes you have done or that you think would be good. What time of year would you recommend for a particular hike/walk? The general idea is to go by public transportation to one place, and walk to another place. Something in the 1-5 day range, so we don't have to carry a lot. The hikes could be through the mountains, along the coast, on trails, on lesser-traveled roads. Could be wilderness, trips to shrines or onsen, farming country, I'm open to it all.  Any island. I speak and read some Japanese and have lots of experience hiking in the remote parts of Alaska. What do you suggest? Anything else we should know? Thanks!!

The computer generated schedule seems to be inaccurate. Could someone give me an idea of the time it takes to get there? It seems a very expensive. If it costs this much I'm not going to go there. What other ways are there to travel? Are there any cheaper ways?

20090227140334AAXWCbH	Travel;Cruise Travel	How do I get out of the Imperial Majesty Scam?	I'm 19, about to be married in June, and when I got this ticket for a free cruise in the mail in December, I figured I'd call and see what it was all about, seeing as I hadn't even thought about what we were going to do for our honey moon.     At the time, they charged 399 on my credit card and said they would take out the remanding 399 over a 6 month period, which they have.  I've already payed my credit card off for everything I owe on it and now owe 464 in the cruise balance.   The other day I tried contacting the cruise line to book the cruise since my wedding was approaching, and they said I would have to pay off the remaining balance just to book the cruise, but when I first called in December they told me I would only have to pay the 200 for boarding fees to book the cruise.    Me being a nice person I just said "OK" like I had forgotten what they really said the first time.  After that I decided to do a little more research about what I was actually getting myself into and now am super worried that we are going to have an awful honeymoon to start our marriage with.   Is there any way to threaten them with the Better Business Burou to get my money back and book a better cruise?   Or how can I prove this as a scam for my credit card company to possibly give me my money back?   Please Help!

20090308065538AAdIv8o	Travel;Asia Pacific;Japan	Japanese "僕の人生、 繚一さんが 決めてる..."?	I'm having problems to translate this sentence "僕の人生、 繚一さんが 決めてる..." in English without sounding akward.       The summary is as follows:   鷲見の負担にならないよう退院を望む尚之は、看護師へ相談しに行った。   そこへ鷲見が現れ、身を隠していた尚之が聞いたのは、退院を反対する言葉だった。... 「僕の人生、 繚一が 決めてる...」 と呟く尚之の側には、病室を抜け出した忍がいて...。      Translation:   Naoyuki consulted with the nurses about him wishing to leave the hospital, so that he won't become a burden to Sumi. Upon the arrival of Sumi, Naoyuki quickly hides and overhear that Sumi  expressed (to the nurses that despite his attempts,) he's not allowed to leave the hospital. Knowing fully well that Sumi won't listen to him, (he continues to sneak away and while being in deep thoughts) he mutters "......."  when he suddenly encounters Shinobu; who slipped out of his room, too.      Any input is appreciated.

It's kinda like a budget trip. I'm just wondering how far is Karterados and Pyrgos located from the central Fira? I have found a few hostel located in such places and claiming that they are within walking distance to Fira. Is that true?      Everything included the bus to Oia, Perrisa beach and the boat excursion port are centrally departed from Fira right? So it is better to find a budget hostel nearby the town Fira right?      Furthermore, may anyone else recommend a budget hotel which suit us (given that easily accessible to bus stop and port since we plan to visit Oia for sunset, perissa beach, wineyard and boat excursion)? Our budget is below 20 pounds per person.

Its only for my personal knowledge, so i can get to know the cultures of different races all over the world. And i seem to know very little bout jewish culture.

What about jews?   3) Also, i have heard that smoking in jewish culture is considered a sin and illegal. Is that right?   4) Is drinking alcohol allowed in jewish culture?   5) If i get pregnant someday, what are the best foods to be eaten for the sake of the baby's brain and IQ?

However, my husband, who is near retirement, lost his job.  He is interviewing in Henderson, NV. and thinks he will get an offer.  We will likely rent but at the end of the probationary period, we will probably consider buying a home there too.  Please help a non desert dweller to mentally adjust to life without forests, orcas, deer, and family.      Where should we look for a home to rent and then buy?   (Schools are not a concern)      I am a substitute teacher.  Is there a need for subs in Henderson?      I hate the idea of dealing with scorpions.  Is it an issue?      You have too many snakes.  Is it an issue in the residential areas, or just outside of town?      I hate heat.  How do locals survive it?  I was in Vegas once when it was 114 degrees.  I could not leave the room.  I was also there once when it snowed, and that too is not a joy.      I am open to a new adventure, but need to arrive prepared for a very different life, and a life without my children and grandchildren.  Help please.

20090308083532AA7ayQK	Travel;United States;Honolulu	Hawaii least white friendly state in the US?	That's what I hear from some white folks who live and lived in Hawaii.  Some white folks also couldn't deal with the cacophony of Asian cultures in Hawaii.   As an Asian living in continental U.S., dealing with Caucasian culture and tolerating (informal) slighting/belittling is a must.  It's not so much the Caucasian culture, it's the (informal) slighting/belittling, and occasionally being singled out as an Asian/Chino/Chinaman/Chink, and being marginalized that I dislike as if anyone cares???  Asians are not considered as minority, it's the mostly blacks and Hispanics that are counted, and paid attention to for their civil rights.  Be that as it may, I would like to know why some white folks in Hawaii are convinced that Hawaii is the LEAST white favorable state in U.S.      I understand occasionally white folks get beat up, and the percentage of Asians are gradually shrinking due to more diversity and increasing arrival of white folks in Hawaii.
