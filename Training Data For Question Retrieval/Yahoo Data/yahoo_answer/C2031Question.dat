However when turning it on it will show the usual HelloMoto screen. However it shows a new Cingular screen. It is Dark Orange and looks completely diffrent.  Same goes for turning it off. Instead of saying Be Safe etc. It will show the Dark Orange screen just before it goes black except for the very middle where it says Bye in small text. A few of the menu Icons are diffrent. The font is diffrent, new default photos etc. As well as when I plug it into the computer, Motorola Phone Tools recognizes it as a V3r.  Any help?

20090225153017AAb5jRM	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	My Zune Isn't Working, Please Help!?	I have had my 4 GB Zune for less than a year, and it is still under warranty.  A few weeks ago, it went dead and wouldn't charge.  I used all USB ports as well as other sync cables.  The next day it was charged and working okay.  I kept it from going dead because I was unsure if I could recharge it.  Yesterday, my Zune informed me I had filled it up too full.  (I have about 300 songs, About 20 minutes worth of video, and 400 pictures, and until then it said I had about two GB left.) Then it shut off and wouldn't come on.  Restarting it didn't help, and it came back on the following morning, but the Back button wasn't working, so I turned it off and it won't come on.  Again with multiple switches, sync cables, USB ports and trying to restart it.  Anyone else with experience or advice?

I'm sick of my Motorola RAZR, and since I'm now a Verizon customer, I can get a new phone.  I really like thing with touch screens, so the Storm, Dare, Omnia, and Voyager are all top priorities on my list.  Probably in that order.        I don't really plan to use the web browser, but texting, taking pictures, and playing some music on my phone are all things I know i'll do.  That and talk on it.  So, as a phone, it should be good.      So, based on that, which phone sounds like the best for me?  I've heard people complain that the Storm's clicky screen keeps you from texting too fast, but that's no problem for my since I don't text fast anyways, and never used a QWERTY pad on a phone.  Other than that, I'm open to anything.
