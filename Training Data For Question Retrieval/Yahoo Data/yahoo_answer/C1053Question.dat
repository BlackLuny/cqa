Eben habe ich mir mal die heutigen Fu?ball-Testspielergebnisse angesehen, und fand:    http://de.eurosport.yahoo.com/fussball/d...       Angeblich 5 (!) Tore nach Elfmetern? Stimmt das wirklich, oder war das einfach nur ein Elfmeterschie?en? Kann ja wegen den Spielminuten kaum sein.   Ist dieses Spiel wirklich so ereignisreich gewesen, oder hat da einfach jemand einen Fehler gemacht?   Kann man sich die Highlights irgendwo ansehen?      Danke im Vorraus!

I am trying to locate an small hunting shack/cabin in the woods somewhere near Rio Medina, TX.  I know it has a tin roof, and I think that there are 3 sheets of tin -- 2 are older and rustier than the 3rd one, so I think it was replaced recently -- a little kitchen-type area with a pump for water at the sink and a camp stove, is in a wooded area that has some river that borders the woods on the east and north, has a pretty large deer head hanging on the wall, a wood stove for heat, and at least one cot with Army blankets.  I need to find this place -- anybody out there know of it?

20080706143702AA7oa5u	Sports;Football (American)	Are NFL rookies overpaid?	Part of the new bargining agreement could include giving some NFL rookies less money. The Dolphins signed rookie, Jake Long, to a $57.5million, 5year deal, with $30.5million guaranted and he has not played a single down in the NFL. Is he being overpaid? I don't think so.      If you are a proven or unproven player then there are no guarantes you will live up to the money. Look how well Tony Romo has played in the last two seasons and look at the contract he signed. Terrel Owens was kicked off the Philadelphia Eagles team, but look at the contract he signed. Potental and on the field performance should play a role in the size of an NFL player's contract.

20080705035631AA9gt1b	Sports;Fantasy Sports	Opinions on this Fantasy Football Keeper League Format?	12 teams, 4 divisions, 3 teams per division   Playoffs are similar to an NFL conference.  4 division champs and 2 wildcards.   Divisions are same every year to build rivalry.      QB, RB, RB, WR, WR, TE, Flex, K, Def   7 bench spots      We decided to use a contract format for our league.   For the first year in the draft, your team gets a 3 year contract and two 2 year contracts to issue to players..  All other players are free game like normal.  Every year, teams are reissued one 3 year contract and one 2 year contract, so ideally a team would always have someone on a 3 year contract and two players on a 2 year contract.        Players are fully tradable, including players who are contracted on your team.  Also allowed are trades of your future draft picks no farther than 2 years ahead, AND you can trade away next years new 2 or 3 year contract to another team.        First draft is standard snake, all drafts afterwards are line drafts starting with last place      Of course we're doing this for lots of $$$...

So my bf ended up injuring his knee in the 2nd game of the football season and because of that he hasnt been able to play at all. and last year he was told that he got cheated by not getting all confrence because all the coaches had said that they should of voted 4 him but they never did. so he was told this year that he'd have a very good chance of getting all confrence.  so that is bothering him also.  he has many other things on his mind like not doing better on the act so he can maybe get more scolarships for college. so he just has a hard time especially when its time 4 the football games. he gets really depressed.  so i was just wondering if there was any way i could help him get through this. or how did u get through it if u werent through the same thing or sumthing similar to it?

20090227173302AA3AcoU	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Fishing	What fishing rod/reel combo should i get my dad?	My dad loves the sport of fishing as much as i do, but his money is very low. He owns only 2 rods and reels, which he uses for carp, suckers and catfish. Both reel/rods are very old, one being the Zebco 33 combo, and the other a Johnson Century combo. I have talked with him about getting him a good rod/reel because, he has always been there for me ... I don't know why i didn't get him another one years ago ...      ok, here's what he likes .      1.) Spincasters. He likes spinning reels, and dreadfully hates baitcasters, as a joke he said he would buy out every baitcasting company and burn all their reels! LMAO ... He said he would want a spincaster, also I'm about 90% in on getting a spincasting outfit, and the other 10 on a spinning combo.      2.) He doesn't like a long rod. 6' is big enough, as he puts it. Easy to carry, and transport. If 6'6 is available it will be alright also.      3.) He fishes for carp, catfish and suckers as said.      4.) The combo should cost less than 45 bucks, and can be bought from Wal-Mart.      5.) And his favorite brands are Zebco, Johnson and Abu Garcia.      He swears by the old 33's, and says that the new ones are not nearly as good ... You think the Platinum series 33 would be any better than the Authentic one?      Thanks to all.

I think it was one of the deepest drafts ever. Five years from now, which players will be superstars, which players will be stars, which will be solid players, which will be role players, and which will be busts?      Here's my thoughts      Superstars: OJ Mayo, Derrick Rose, Eric Gordon      Stars: Russell Westbrook, Brooke Lopez, Jason Thompson,       Solid players: JJ Hickson, JaVale McGee, DeAndre Jordan, Mareese Speights, Kevin Love, DJ Augustin      Role players: Robin Lopez, Nicholos Batum, George Hill, Mario Chalmers, Luc Richad Mbah A Moute, Bill Walker      Busts: Michael Beasley (whatever happened to being a rebounding machine? Less then 6rpg), Danilo Gallinari, Brandon Rush      How do you categorize these players and where will last years draft rank all-time?

Their main priority is getting DWare signed to a long term deal, and I totally agree with that. There is also talk about bringing in Ray Lewis which makes no sense to me. They need to sign DWare, and do their best to retain players like Canty and Zach Thomas. Also, we need a backup QB and a safety that will cover and hit. I don't see the reasoning in throwing a lot of money at an aging Ray Lewis when that money can be put to better use. What do you guys think?
20090227175413AA0yQM8	Sports;Basketball	What should I award to the champions (and MVP) of my 2 on 2 basketball League?	I have a 2 on 2 basketball league with a website and everything with other kids around my age in the city. Most of them are friends, and I spend a lot of time working on it to make it nice. We keep stats and have an all-star break with a dunk contest and everything. It's a lot of fun and I am going to ask for a small entry fee (probably $5) and supply some kind of award (In previous seasons i was lucky enough to get a donation from one of the players, it was a basketball medal that goes around the neck)      I'm looking for something pretty cool that would fit a budget of $15-$20 a piece at most, preferably about ten.      Things I had in mind but couldn't find were fake or cheap basketball championship rings. I couldn't find anything that worked and my last resort is to get my mom to mold medals out of her silver clay stuff (or rings if we can figure out how to make them)      I would really love some other suggestions, so thanks for any ideas.

After the Knicks have bought out Marbury w/ the trades they have done and the fact that the 11th man is MIA for us in Curry because of health/family problems. The Knicks have a 10 man roster. NBA regulations say a team can have no less than 12 and no more than 16. Well 10 is less than 12 what will happen?      I say Knicks should go after Bonzi Wells he has had a very good career in the NBA and proved all he needed to do in China being a 48 PPG player and he has revoked his contract for Shanghai wanting to return. He can do it all and is a bit of a headcase, but it is more controllable than a Marbury headcase. Plus, he plays well in the playoffs.      Also, Pat Ewing Jr. would make a nice choice he is an all out hustle player. Any other choices?

20090225073113AAYiMWF	Sports;Hockey	NHL trade deadline, 20 - 20 hindsight, and the Golden Fleece?	Over the past decade which deadline trades stand out as being the most beneficial to both teams and which do you think were the most one sided?      My pick for most beneficial to both would have to go to the 2000 deal of Brendan Morrison to Vancouver for Alex Mogilny. One that could eventually upstage this is last year's deal that sent Brad Richards to Dallas for Mike Smith.      2007 deadline day gave us a couple gems for the Golden Fleece award. I'll give the nod to Philly for grabbing Scottie Upshall, Ryan Parent and first and third Guitar picks for Peter Foresberg. On par the same year, the Blues wrangle Glen Metropolit and 4 draft picks from Atlanta for Keith Tkachuk (who promptly re-signs with St. Louis in the off-season)
