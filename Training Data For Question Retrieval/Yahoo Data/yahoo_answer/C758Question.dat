20081021090739AAyzSpp	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Cut out a few things...I still get cravings...?	So I cut beef, pork, lamb out of my diet, I also won't go to KFC or McD's anymore (heard bad things about them).  I still eat chicken and turkey though and fish.  It wasn't for health reasons, it was for humane reasons.  I'd like to give up the other animals, but I LOVE chicken (sorry!!!!!!!!).  Anyway, I haven't had those other meats oh in about 2 months and for the most part I'm fine (have totally avoided even a morsel of any of it).  The problem is, I still get cravings for those beef hotdogs (Koshers Best, Vienna Beef) and ground beef taco's/burritos.        I've made ground chicken tacos, but it isn't the same.  Is there any kind of seasoning that would remind me of ground beef Mexi food?      Also, are there any top brands of hotdogs that would remind me beef hotdogs but that come in turkey or chicken instead?      Regardless, I am not going to eat those meats again, I am not going back on what I believe...it would just be nice to satisfy those pesky cravings haha.

20081016082056AAc5Egw	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Designing Menu's- What would you like to see on a menu?	So I'm working on a project for class and we have to design our own menu for a theoretical restaurant we would open. Restaurants, while they all have different variations of a particular item, can seem to get kind of generic. I mean, how many different ways can you make a house salad, a club sandwich, baked salmon, a cheeseburger, or some chicken fingers and fries. I'm trying to think outside the box a little bit on this one, and think of stuff that you just don't see on menus that often, or kind of forgotten favorites. I'm open to anything from the traditional italian or mexican to anything you can think of that the average diner would be familiar with. Thinking casual dining so don't get too fancy on me. Casual dining to me is something along the lines of like Outback, Cheesecake, Claimjumpers, PF Changs, etc.. Also, I'm trying to go a little healthier approach on this. Nothing fried is my goal on this menu. Also trying to stay away from stuff thats cooked with a lot of butter, cream, etc..

I got a marshmallow fondant recipe off of you tube, which is made of marshmallows, powdered sugar, water, and crisco. I already made the fondant, and I had to make the colors very bold, so I used food coloring to dye it. Anyways, when I go to work with it, the edges aren't clean cut, and it seems like more of a silly putty rather than play dough. Is it supposed to be like that? I'm making a poker table cake, this is not only my first real cake decorating experience, it's also my first time using fondant. So would it be okay to use devils food cake with chocolate frosting? I guess i need a good website about fondant, how to make it, what it's like, and the "rules of gravity" explained.. lol so if anyone knows of a great website, that would be awesome!
