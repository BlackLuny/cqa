20090219212542AAHoOtZ	Health;Mental Health	Can you control what you do in your sleep?	I can. I think it's a pretty awesome talent, because no other person in my family can. You see, I can do this every time I dream. I control them every night, what I say, what I do, etc. And for the first time a couple of months ago, I had a dream where I walked into a home and could actually SMELL cigarette smoke in my dream. **No, nobody in my family smokes. I find it very odd that I could actually smell smoke in the house I entered in my dreams, and I even coughed in reaction to it. I really do love what I can do. I really love sleeping and this is one of the reasons why. I find it very fun. I was just wondering if I was some type of freako alien thing, or if there are actually other people who can do it also.      Goodbye now.         I must be one lucky guy, because i can do it EVERY night.

I have to see a cardiologist 1 time every spring and I was supposed to have a baseline stress test before my next visit.  I had surgery for appendicitis, so he told me to get my strength back before I went for the test.  Then I developed plantar fascitis so bad I had to take 2 weeks off work, and had special supports made for my shoes. My foot still gets hurting, so I usually have to warm up a little bit before I start walking. I have had an unbelievable cold/flu season.  I am still coughing from my last cold which started on Valentines day.  I still am having problems walking without a gimp on occasion because of pain in my right foot.  Will I be able to do the stress test before April?  Whats it like?  I sound lik a sickie, but I really do ok.  I had to be ablated for AV node re-entry in 2005 and I have palpitations really bad on occasion. Sometimes I dont have them at all, but the MD wants a stress test.  How bad is it?

20090219211413AAiDuby	Health;Mental Health	Confused about psychotherapy?	I've been seeing a neuro-psychologist (a psychiatric nurse practitioner referred him, after I insisted to cease meds - anti-depressives and anti-convulsive/mood stabilizers).      Initially, I felt I was getting a lot of help, good advise, improving finding out about root problems (substance abuse/personality disorder/poor support network/depression etc.).        But now after a little over 2 months, I feel like I don't understand half of the stuff he's telling me and why, or he is not hearing me what I'm saying... I'm asking concrete questions and feel that he doesn't answer them.  I'm confused as to if I'm supposed to continue coming, and when I called and talked to his secretary, she said he'd call back (it's been nearly two weeks).  Should I call back again, or would that be considered like clingy, "fatal attraction" kind, harassing?      Am I misinterpreting if I presume that he not calling, means that I shouldn't come back and leave him alone for whatever reasons?      thousands of things go through my head, maybe he feels that I'm just fine and don't need any further of his help (or occupy his time), maybe he feels I'm hopeless and can't be helped anyway, or   Maybe something's wrong with my insurance and he knows I just got fired, too (related to the issue why I'm seeing him) and won't be able to dispense financially as much as prior?         I'm confused as to if I'm spinning something out of proportion in my head, or if I have 'cognitive' defects that I have difficulties reading obvious 'messages'.  Any perspectives, USEFUL advise

MR T-SPINE   Findings: Vertebral alignment: normal   Marrow signal: normal   Verterbal height: there is a compression fracture of the t9 vertberal body with approximately 25-49% loss of vertbral body height.   there is no significant edema within the vertebral body, and no associated soft tissue or epidural mass. there is a schmorls node within the superior endplate of t9. no othe rcompression fracture are seen.   disc space height: normal   cord signal: normal   small posterior disc osteophyte complex at c6-c7 with no significant associated spinal canal stenosis.   CONCLUSION:   compression fracture of the t9 vertebral body with normal vertebral alignment and no associated spinal canal stenosis or spinal cord injury. there is no edems within the t9 vertberal body, and no associated soft tissue or epidural mass to suggest malignancy, however, if there is persistant clinical concern for an underlying neoplastic process, mri with contrast may be useful for further evaluation.      CT 3D   FINDINGS: Bony structures: compression fracture of the t9 vertebral body.   alignment, normal.   prevertebral soft tissues: mild rounding soft tissue prominence around the fracture.   CONCLUSION:   compression fracture of the t9 vertebral body, likely subacute or chronic, with mild paraspinal soft tissue prominence.           my dr told me it wasnt cancerous or osteo, but this is a non traumatic compression fracture, and EVERY PERSON ive talked to says there has to be a reason for my fracture, it cant just go unsolved, and thats where my dr left me.   thank you to the 2nd poster, appreciate it, so than there shouldnt be much to worry about? the pain is getting worse, so from the results, was that likely to happen?

I am going to see the specialist for my broken leg for the first time tomorrow.  = (       The ER doctor didn't know if I will need surgery or a full cast.  He just wrapped my leg up in a splint. From what I heard a full cast means it will go from toes up to my hip. (Is that correct?)      What should I expect from the visit?  Anything that I need bring or prepare for?
20090219213421AAIfMNk	Health;Mental Health	Lately I have been feeling so depressed and now I am getting nervous...?	I have suffered with depression my whole life. I even had thoughts of suicide and had panic attacks in the 4th grade. Lately, I have been feeling so depressed/stressed out/nervous/paranoid/loss of appitite/weepy/abnormal sleeping patterns(waking up in the middle of the night,getting tired in the middle of the day,tossing and turning) and I have been having really horrable dreams. I know this sounds wierd but they say that evil spirits prey on negativity. Ever since I have been feeling down I have been feeling very uneasy. Like waking up feeling like someone or something else is around. It's like a threatening unwelcome feeling. I also hear noises like bumps, creaks, and even footsteps when no one is there. I don't want to be alone it scares me so much. Maybe I'm being paranoid but I don't know for sure. I honestly could cry at any moment. Lately I have been crying every day and sometimes having break downs with suicidal thoughts. I have no patience so I am snapping at people I love and feeling so guilty about it. I hate myself for making those close to me feel bad. My BF (and baby daddy) says he can't handle me with my depression and that it is always drama with me. He tells me I am bringing him down and that he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life with me like this. Then I feel even more horrable. I am trying to go to school to finally get my HS diploma but I am just getting by. It's hard to care. I'm broke. I go to a free prenatal clinic that seems put there patients last (paperwork, lunch, socalizing with friends who drop in) and treats me like crap. I don't want to go anymore but everyone guilts me into going saying that it is best for my unborn baby. There not very thourough and they don't listen to what I say until I b***h. Needless to say I don't get along with most of the staff there. I have tried switching but everyone tells me that since I am so far along, I am too big of a risk so they won't take me. I have no money so I can't afford therapy or meds. I just feel so helpless. I don't have a bad life but I hate it anyway. Before, when I would get depressed, I would self medicate with alcohol, cigarettes, and whatever else took my mind off things. Now that I am pregnant I can't, so life has become even harder to deal with. Experience has taught me that life gets harder as you get older. That's what makes me want to blow my brains out. If I can't handle it now, what do I have to look forward to later...an institution? Plus, I have a baby on the way. I know I will do everything I can for her but I don't think that will be enough. I don't want to teach her how to be depressed. I don't feel ready for anything. I feel so sensitive, like I have been rubbed raw. I don't need to be judged or ridiculed. The last thing I need are insults. I just want a little insight, advice, or I don't know maybe to know that I'm not the only one. I know I need help. This is the closest thing to it I can think of right now. Thanks

I've been getting brazilian waxes several times a year for the past 5-6 years from a skilled local esthetician and have never had a problem.  I visited her yesterday for my periodical brazilian and I guess she was a little distracted or something, but I noticed that the wax was a touch hotter than what I'm normally used to.  It didn't seem like a big deal at the time and I was fine all day afterward.  However, I woke up this morning with terrible irritation and itchiness in my sensitive areas where I was waxed.  I feel like my nether regions are recovering from a burn.  What can I do to safely alleviate my discomfort?  I've tried Neosporin, Hydrocortisone, and Gold Bond which help a little, but not as much as I'd like.

Because their parents had to have given it to my Aunt... and only if he DID have it, then there would be a 50/50 chance of me having it - correct? (If he did NOT have it, then I am fine?)      Unfortunately, my father committed suicide when he was 35 years old, so we have no confirmed test. However, my father had uncontrollable movements of his lower arms and hands, as they were documented in his mental hospital stay. He also had severe deterioration of his memory, as that was also documented. He was also very depressed. Lastly, he mentioned to my uncle before he committed suicide that he had a disease "that he couldn't remember the name of but he would lose his mind and body, and couldn't live that way."      The reason I started looking into this, aside from Aunt having it, is due to my own health concerns. Over this past year, I have a hard time finding words, and carrying on a conversation effectively. To the point that I get teased by friends, families, and acquaintances, when these talking hiccups (as I call them) happen. I also have weird twitching of my fingers, and this might sound weird, but in my lower abdomen too. Sometimes it's so pronounced that it feels like I am pregnant again and have a kicking baby.

I wake up at 7AM, so I'm getting 5 hours (at the most) of sleep a night!   That's horrible, especially for a teen..      I've tried Tylenol PM, but it doesn't help..      Also, on the weekend I'll go to bed at about 2AM,   and will wake up at 4PM or later the next day (if not disturbed).   Usually my Mom will wake me up at 11AM, or so..      I ALWAYS feel groggy.      But, if I only sleep for less than three hours exactly,   I don't feel tired at all.         So, any ideas how to fix this?   Or do I need to consult a doctor?

20090219215712AAIifcy	Health;Diet & Fitness	How should we deal with the "fat problem"?	America has an overwhelming overweight population, and we're doing nothing about it. Japan has started fining the overweight people over 40, New Zealand has laws barring people too heavy from immigrating, and Germany plans to spend 47 million on healthy eating and sports programs for its overweight population. Yet America does nothing with its over 97.1 million overweight people.      The question is; what should we do to fix the problem? As i see it there are 4 ways. First, we can fine the overweight people, though this might not fly so well with them. Second, we could begin severely taxing the companies that create overwhelmingly unhealthy food. Third, we could begin create programs to help people lose weight. Or fourth, we could begin exterminating them. Indeed, this seems to be the best option, instead of wasting resources, or damaging the economy we can simply embrace the fat population, and then eat them!      What do you think?

20090219220208AANLTAb	Health;Mental Health	Dealing with body dysmorphic disorder?	I normally wouldn't have the courage to post my photo online, but I feel so awful and so depressed that at this point I don't think it matters. I'm now 31 years old and I haven't been in any kind of relationship for more than eleven years. My therapist has discussed a disorder known as Body Dysmorphic Disorder (or BDD), and it sounds a lot like what I experience. I wish that I could wake up in the morning, and as I'm preparing for the day, at least feel somewhat good about my appearance. When you've had people run you down to your face (and on one occasion have someone tell you that you look like Beavis) it makes it very difficult to have a sense of self-esteem and value.      I don't know what to do anymore. It would be a dream come true for me if I could have plastic surgery and look like someone else, but I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon. The feelings of worthlessness that make up my existence is something that I wouldn't wish upon anyone, not even on someone I hated.      My parents, one of the few people that I would disucss this with in person, say that I'm handsome. But, they're my parents. How many mothers or fathers do you know of who would tell their son or daughter they are ugly? Our parents always see us through different eyes than the rest of the world.       http://i302.photobucket.com/albums/nn111...        http://i302.photobucket.com/albums/nn111...        http://i302.photobucket.com/albums/nn111...

I've been getting this weird feeling in my stomach a lot, and it spreads to my heart, and I always need to take a moment to sit down and burp or something to get rid of the feeling. But most of the time, I just feel like I can't breathe properly, and I just want to get rid of the contents of my stomach. I don't want to throw up, but I feel like I have to. I'm not anorexic or bulimic, but this new feeling is really strong and extremely unpleasant. What is wrong with me? And how can I fix it?

I have had anxiety/depress for the past 4 years and I always fall into these holes where I distance myself from my friends, have no energy, and no drive. I'm really trying to snap out of it but i can never seem to keep motivated cause something always goes wrong and i give up. For example today I tried to work out but when i ran on the treadmill I started getting really dizzy because i'm not used to it, which lead me to making the whole day unproductive(I think i might be a perfectionist). Has anyone gone throught this that can tell me how they over came it? Any advice?
20090219221008AABc4Aw	Health;Dental	Wisdom teeth removed, nasty taste in mouth, haven't done saltwater rinse.?	About a week ago I had 3 wisdom teeth extracted. The bleeding lasted for probably 3 days, then stopped. Everything seems to be going alright, I've taken the pain meds they gave me plus the swelling meds as directed. They also gave me an oral rinse which reminds me of Listerine although I'm sure it has medication in it, too, which I've (for the most part) been swishing as directed. The blood is gone, meds are gone, but now I'm getting like some sort of discharge. I'm not sure what farts taste like, but if they have taste, I have a feeling they taste something like this. It's truly putrid. I had stitches which I believe they said were going to dissolve...I don't know much about mouths, but it looks like the stitches are gone one way or another...and it's weird because where the teeth were extracted, it's like there's a cut in the gum that looks like it probably should be attached ie I'm guessing there used to be stitches there but not anymore.      I did ONE saltwater rinse, although I didn't fully follow the directions. It tasted just as bad, if not, worse, and I figured, hey, I bet I'll be fine.      I'll admit I'm rather tired so I might be forgetting something, but I think I've got what I needed to say...so, does anyone know exactly what this is, and what some ways are to deal with the constant taste? Any idea how long it will last? What exactly is the saltwater rinse supposed to accomplish? Is there a way I can tell if maybe I should have done the rinsing?

However, for the past day or two, I've been having some pain in the left side of my chest.

My parents both went to medical school, so if it appeared to be serious, I'd think they'd know...And like I said, it's been going on for a day or two, and I'm under the impression that heart attack symptoms generally appear a few hours before the actual attack? (Or am I completely wrong?)   I'm also quite nervous/anxious at the moment, but that's probably because of this. And I don't have any other symptoms, as far as I know.

20090219222550AAoJSDL	Health;Mental Health	What about the lithium and salt relationship?	Ok, I am embarking on my bipolar treatment, and of course, don't want to take meds if I can at all avoid it. I got a script for carbamazepine yesterday, but still don't want to go there if I can help it.      I think this afternoon, I've think had an epiphany lol      About 3 months ago, I decided to cut salt completely out of my diet, after going a bit heavy handed for a few months prior. Since then, I've been the worst, biplor wise, as I ever have been. This is what has prompted me to go seek meds, finally.       Just prior to stopping all salt, I was the happiest and most stable I've ever been. I thought I had a handle on things.      I have heard lithium called a 'salt' and it's chemical symbol is Li, but salts' symbol is NaCl. So, how can lithium be called a salt?      Is the salt intake related to my mood swings??? Weird it seems, but I'm sure going to do a mood diary and ramp back up the salt intake and see where I'm at in 3 months. And just leave the meds for now.      Can anyone please enlighten me as to the relationship of lithium and salt?
20090219223347AA72TC8	Health;Mental Health	How do I help my boyfriend to understand my depression and panic disorders?	I've had depression and anxiety/panic disorders for as long as I can remember.  I believe it's caused mostly by my genetics, seeing as my mother has also struggled with it all of her life as well.  It has already caused many problems in my life such as drug addiction, suicidal tendencies, and just not being able to live life like regular people do.  Although I am much better than I used to be years ago, I still struggle with severe panic attacks and deep, long periods of depression.  I've been seeing a guy since last November and we just recently became official boyfriend and girlfriend.  I've been staying at his house more often than usual and he's starting to see that I'm not as happy as he thought I was.  He's witnessing first hand my mood fluctuations, my sudden bursts of unreasonable fear, and everything else that comes along with having these horrid illnesses.  He has expressed that he doesn't know much, if anything, about depression and anxiety and has never had to deal with anyone who had either one.  At first he made me feel comfortable enough to be open about my issues with him, but the more depressed and anxious I get, the more I see him backing away and saying things like "Why are you being like this?" and "It's all in your head, just get over it."  I can see where he is coming from having never dealt with mental illness before but I can't see our future looking bright if he can't begin to understand why I am the way I am, and not giving me the comfort these diseases require me to have to stay sane.  The way he has been acting makes me feel like a crazy person, or like a little kid crying over spilt milk.  I KNOW I'm not crazy, just sick, but I can't take being put down like that for long.  What do I do?  I plan on doing my part by getting back on medication and getting it back under control but no medication cures thses things.  What do I say to him, I'm just totally lost at what to do.

My body's fatigued and I'm noticing that I'm getting moody. My breasts are a little tender. Now, I've taken the pill before but it's been many years ago. I don't remember feeling like this. Plus, when I took it before I took one pill at the doctors and the other 12 hours later. On thursday the nurse had me take both at once. Which I thought was strange. Also, could I have been pregnant already and it just not show up on the test cause it was too early?

20070925022751AAi7e24	Health;Diet & Fitness	Why does green tea give me a UTI?	I heard about the health benefits of green tea so I started drinking about 6-8 mugs a day and got a pretty severe UTI which got better with antibiotics but very soon after I came off them it came back (not as severe) and lasted about three weeks while I was still drinking green tea but then as soon I stopped drinking green tea it started clearing up and went completely. A few weeks later I tried drinking it again and got the beginning of a UTI so I guess I can never have it again (which is a shame 'cause I like the taste and it has many health benefits).   But I'm just confused as to how it can cause a UTI...it's not the caffeine 'cause I can drink that much coffee/black tea and have no problems and I don't add sugar/milk, just boiling water that's cooled for 3 mins. Also many sites recommend green tea for getting rid of UTIs so this really confuses me.

Then I went to the eyeglass lady and as soon as she saw me she was like "Oh honey, you can check out these small frames, I knew you needed them as soon as I saw you" and I was like "You haven't seen my prescription yet" and I showed it to her and she kinda put her hand over her mouth, and said "It's worse than I thought."

20081216063119AAcqTuH	Health;Mental Health	I don't know what to do about this situation, can anyone help? :'[?	I'm 14-years-old and have been cutting since September due to depression. I also have insomnia.      Yesterday I fell out with my mother because she told me that I could go to my granddads funeral but never turned up to take me there. I'm still really angry at her so I've just been freezing her out as much as I could. Whenever I don't speak to my mum she gets annoyed and takes little digs at me throughout the evening.   Today I was late catching the school bus and my mother kept screeching at me to hurry up. I was really embarrassed and angry at the same time, because I loath school and the bus and my mother was just making it worse. So I (calmly) told her that I wasn't going to school today. She had a massive fit, calling me "vain, selfish, stupid, vindictive" etc. and shut me in my room.      I sneaked out of my room, grabbed a coat and old wine bottle, and marched over muddy countryside (I live on a farm) to get to this lone wall on the edge of a field. I smashed the glass bottle and cut my arm with the pieces. It didn't work. I then marched off into town to kill myself.      I walked 2 miles into town, had a change of heart, and another 3 miles to get to the hospital. At the hospital I asked to see a councilor (I told them I was 16). They didn't have any, so I spoke to a nurse and told her about my cutting. She cleaned up the wounds then (despite my objections) called up my mum. I don't know what they talked about though. When my mum arrived she took me to see my GP.      My GP asked me questions; "how's school?","How's home life?" etc. but I lied and made it seem like I was fine because I didn't want my mum to know that I was suffering with this depression. When he asked if I wanted her to leave, I said no again... if I had asked her to leave then she would know that something was bothering me. If I had asked her to leave and then confessed to my GP what was wrong, he would (by law) have to put me on 'happy pills' or recommend me to a shrink, in which case, my mum would have to know. Either way, my mum was going to know what was going on. And even if I did come clean and say "Mum, I'm depressed and I self-harm; I think I need help" she would just deny it. I wouldn't want to give her another thing to worry about anyway, she's got alot on her plate right now and I know I'm not helping.    So I let her stay and breath over my shoulder as my GP and his side-kick analyzed me for any hesitation. Everyone could see I was anxious; thankfully my mum put that down to embarrassment. I made it sound like I was a spoiled git that ran away because I didn't want to go to school and this was just a one time thing. I don't think he believed me but my mum did, and that's all that counts.      My mum and I drove home in silence. I couldn't tell if she was angry with me or not - she definitely wasn't feeling sympathetic - she sounded fed up? She asked me what I fell onto so that I hurt my arm, which must mean that the nurse had covered for me. I lied again and said that I fell on broken glass whilst climbing the fence.      I am home alone now and I don't know what to do... homework I guess... I want to start cutting again but I'm stronger than that. Can anyone help me? What should I say to my mum? Should I say anything at all - I mean, it's so close to Christmas why ruin it?
20081216065746AAbZEsd	Health;Mental Health	Why Do I CONSTANTLY Feel The Urge To "Repeat My Life"?	I have this habit to "repeat my life."      This habit is best described through an example.      1) If On July 16, 2006, I take a walk down Street X from 7:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., I will take a walk down Street X from 7:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., on EVERY subsequent July 16.      2) If on November 4, 2007, I eat lunch in Restaurant ABC from 12:15 p.m. to 1:30 p.m., I will eat lunch in Restaurant ABC from 12:15 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. on EVERY  subsequent November 4.      3) If on July 23, 2003, I borrow Movie Y from the Library, I borrow Movie Y from the Library on EVERY subsequent July 23.       Etc.      Why do I do this? Should I try to stop this behavior? If so, how? What does this behavior mean? My brother says it's probably because I don't want to grow older, so by repeating my life, I try to stay younger. For example, I try to stay in 2006 or 2007, by repeating events from those years.

So do you think I will get better? I have long legs but I'm not really in shape like I'm not fat but I'm chubby-ish. And I NEED to show that I can do good because when people found out I was joining they were all like laughing and like shocked~ I'm in 7th grade but the team is like 7th-11th grade co-ed. And today Was sooooo painful everybody was saying it was the cold but It hurt so bad! and I'm nervous for the first meet because it's a month from tomorrow and all the other schools have been practicing for like 2 months and coach said those other teams are gonna fly by our fast runners!! ANY ADVICE?? PLEASE!!! and What is a good shoe I could get? I don't want anything expensive because this only lasts 2 months but I don't have many tennis shoes.

20081216063115AAMpsY4	Health;Mental Health	Help! I have a serious anger problem!?	Ever since I was a little kid, I have been struggling with anger. This is the reason why I really don't have many friends because I lose my temper A LOT. I hated it in grammar school when people would make fun of me because I was different, and that made me really upset. I like to defend myself when people make fun of me, but its always physical. I have always pushed or shoved people or threaten to get my point, but realizing it now that never works. I used to take medication, but stopped because I think it wasn't working.  I am 19 now, and I have improved a lot, I guess. From time to time, I have a serious outburst. Like for instance, yesterday, my mom found out on facebook that I made a threat to kill someone. BIG MISTAKE!!! This girl was making fun of me on facebook, and I was kinda sick and tired of it, and the only way for me to stop it was my anger. I let my anger get the best of me. I regret writting this because you can get arrested for this, and I don't ever want to end up in prison. What I did was horrible, but I really, really want to stop this! nothing has worked, and I want to go to anger management, but my parents both say "its in your control". But its not! I need help, and they don't get it! I don't have the money to get help, but if i don't get help it will get worse, like it is now! i want to learn to stop being angry at everything and be normal! I really am a good person, but I get angry and mean a lot! which I don't get why I am such an angry person inside! please help!

20090219171211AANbXtr	Health;Women's Health	Should i get a new gynocologist?	or maybe im overreacting a little. Ive been to planned parenthood before for a possible pregnancy. Im 20 years old, and i just wanted to go somewhere that was free quick and easy. i went a total of two times. the first time i had a lady gyno perform what would be like a regular annual exam. she was very gentle and i barely felt any discomfort. she talked me through the entire thing. she told me if i had any discomfort in my stomach within a week to come back.   so i did have discomfort and made another appt as i should have. when i went they told me i would be seeing a male doctor, and asked if i had any issues with that. i figured that my health was more important that whether the doctor doing their job is male or female, so i went for it. i was a little nervous because i figured since he's a guy, he would be a little rough on me, but to my surprise, he was even better than the female doctor i had seen 2 weeks earlier.   so i decided it was time to get a legitamate (idk how to spell tht lol) gynocologist. i called and made an appointment. i went to the gynocologist, who was a female. she introduced herself and was very nice, which made me feel comfortable. i wasn't really nervouse to begin with because i have had the procedure done before without any pain. she left the room and told me to get undressed and to put the drape on. i did as i was told but she took a while to get back. while in her office i was up and around looking at the posters and information she had up around her counter. while looking i looked down to see some pamphlets, which were right next to the sink. i looked into the sink and saw alot of the metal clamps that they use for the exam with TONS of blood on it. i suddenly got butterflies in my stomach. i decided it would be best to sit back on my seat. when she finally came, she told me what she would be doing. she took out a new clamp and shoved it right in me. i couldnt even breathe i was so shocked. she kept telling me to breathe and relax, and i was trying to, but the pain was like nothing i felt before. she was very rough with the q-tip samples she took, as well as very rough taking out the clamp. when it was time for her to put in her fingers to check my ovarys, i thought it wouldnt be that bad, but i think that was even worse. i was relieved when i caught a glimpse of the clamp and saw that it had no blood on it. but when she took out her fingers as she was finishing the exam, i saw blood on the gloves. i was really mortified.   i asked her if the exam is really suppose to hurt so much, and if it is normal to bleed. she simply said some people have pain, some people dont, some people bleed, some people dont. I left the office almost hating her. i think she was a little to rough on me, and i would hate to think that she does that to anyone else. im not pregnant so i know it doesnt add to the sensitiviy.   what do yu think? am i just being overreactive or what? any advice on what i should do ?

20081021191656AA2xiPY	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	How do I help someone who is bulimic anorexic?	So, a year ago, my cousin was introduced to her brother's best friend. He annoyed and teased her (like every teen) and made it very obvious that he had a crush on her. She didnt care much because she was a year older than him, and just didnt think much of it.      Somewhere in the past year, they began talking alot and became really good friends. Eventually, they started liking each other as well. She was afraid of publicly being in relationship with him because of two main reasons:   1) He was a year younger than her in highschool   2) He was her brother's BEST friend.      Long story short, they got involved in a relationship without worrying about the consequences. Soon after, I found out my cousin was diagnosed with bulimia-anorexia, depression, ADD, and OCD (quite a handfull--i know!).      Her grades went down drastically as well, and she ended up staying behind a 5th year in highschool to improve her marks (because she got rejected by the university she was supposed to attend due to her poor grades). Sometimes, I wonder if she purposely failed so she could stay an extra year just to be with her boyfriend!      I have a strong feeling that this has all happend because of this boy.    She is still with him today, and now when I talk to her, I realize that her motives in life have completley changed...      She's obsessed with losing weight (she was chubby as a child, and now shes SUPER thin because she purges every night). She doesnt eat anything for 5 days, and on the 6th day, she eats excessively (binge eating) and throws it all up in the washroom.      She is taking therapy for her bulimic-aneroxic condition--but honestly I dont think its helping!!! She seems to be proud of her accomplishment (of loosing so much weight) and I dont want to admit this...but she does look kinda good now that she has lost sooo much weight. Is there a way to get her eating right? And do you think that this boy is the cause of all of her "problems"?      Just so I make this clear, I think bulimic-anorexic people are VAIN and SELF OBSESSED, and I dont think its a medical condition, but more of a "disease in your head".

Do you think that it is possible that overuse of vibrators(meaning every other day for two years) is it possible that this would cause the clitoris to become less sensitive?

About 5 seconds after two massive bumps appeared on either side of my head. Luckily it went on my left part of my forehead. Although Ive still got one on me right, and if its realy dark, its hard to see although in certain light ie. Sun,Room light it reflects and goes massive. I might be just paranoid but it puts me down alot, Ive even cut out a plaster very small and tryed conceling it.       I used to shave me head 0 all over although because of this ive been growning it for about 4 months now, am trying to get a fringe just because of this.      So if anyone would mind giving me the reasons why it has not left my forehead and anyway of removing it or how to decrease it.

The pain has only gotten worse since then. It's hard to describe the pain, but it's like an excruciating, throbbing ache in my lower back (and sometimes in my abdomen). It's the worst on the first day of my period, pretty bad on the second day and then it lets up. Also, whenever I'm menstruating, I get sharp (brief) pains in my colon area. They only last 5-10 seconds, but they're very painful! Sometimes they come on randomly and sometimes they occur while I'm having a bowel movement.       Also, what would you recommend to treat the pain? I used ibuprofen, but recently it hasn't been working enough. Went to the doctor and was perscribed Naproxin, but it didn't help either. I'm going to the doctor Monday for birth control. Hopefully this will help!

20090219180102AAnxuXJ	Health;Women's Health	WSW 2/19/09  HeLp AsAp HeLp AsAp?	CHICAGO — A landmark Energy Department project to bury carbon dioxide produced by humans has begun as workers sunk a huge drill bit into Illinois ground this week, signaling continued support for a climate change mitigation strategy that has fallen out of favor in many circles.      The start of drilling marks the launch a geological sequestration project that will deposit a million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the ground by 2012.      While that's nothing compared to the several billion tons of CO2 that humans emit yearly, it's the geology of the site that makes the development exciting. The CO2 will be piped into a geological formation that underlies parts of Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky that could eventually hold more than 100 billion tons of CO2.      "This is going to be a large-scale injection of 1 million metric tons, one of the largest injections to date in the U.S." project manager Robert Finley said here at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting Sunday.      While the Department of Energy and private industry have been pushing to create cheaper renewable energy and investigating increased nuclear-power options to reduce carbon emissions, carbon capture and sequestration remains an attractive idea. It would allow regions of the country like the southeast, which don't have Texas or California-level wind or solar resources, to continue burning coal without contributing to climate change.      To do that, many technological issues will need to be solved. Last year, the Bush administration canceled the DOE's most expensive carbon capture and sequestration project, FutureGen, and some utility executives have questioned whether storing CO2 will actually make sense. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that as much as 30 percent of the energy created by a coal plant would have to be spent on just pulling the CO2 out of its flue gas.      But new materials for more selectively capturing CO2 from gas mixes continue to be created in labs like Omar Yaghi's at UCLA and at Georgia Tech under Chris Jones. Those innovations could make the capture part of "carbon capture and sequestration" easier than it currently is. Add in a carbon tax of some form and fossil-fuel power plant operators would have the incentive to start capturing a lot of carbon dioxide. Then, they'll just need somewhere to put it.      The DOE thinks the United States has more than enough underground closet space.      Mt_simon_slide "What we found in the U.S. with the research that we've done over the last 10 years is that there is a significant potential to store CO2 ... in these very large reservoirs that are underground," said John Litynski, who works in the fossil-fuel-centered National Energy Technology Laboratory's Sequestration Division.      But most current sequestration projects use the carbon dioxide to squeeze more oil and gas out of depleted fields. Those fields probably won't cut it for much larger amounts of CO2. For that, we'll have to turn to huge reservoirs deeper underground. That's why the Illinois demonstration project is so important. It will test a formation called the Mt. Simon sandstone, allowing scientists to track in near real-time what happens when they start putting large amounts of compressed carbon dioxide 6,500 feet below the surface.      "We have numbers for what we think the capacity is in the U.S., but the only way to prove that is to actually drill a well," said Litynski.      Drilling a 6,500-foot well doesn't come cheap — the Illinois Basin project has an $84 million price tag. It's a collaboration between the DOE and industrial partners including Archer Daniels Midland, which is providing the land for the test site and will serve up CO2 from its ethanol fermenters. A group of scientists centered at the Illinois State Geological Survey known as the Midwest Geological Carbon Sequestration Consortium are leading the research.      They'll collect enormous amounts of data about how the CO2 plume moves through the pores in the sandstone. The Mt. Simon formation is particularly attractive because of a series of fortuitous events that have placed three layers of impermeable rock — known as "cap rock" — between the sandstone and the surface. Finley thinks that makes the project a very good bet to succeed in keeping CO2 buried away for what amounts to forever in human timescales.      But the audience at the AAAS meeting who watched the researchers present their sequestration evidence weren't wholly convinced. They gave the presenters a rougher time than one normally sees at this meeting, where most questions are softballs. One audience member noted that the Mt. Simon project was sequestering 10,000 times less CO2 than we'd have to put into the ground each year to offset human emissions.      It's the expense and time needed to scale up the tech that leads renewable energy advocates to complain that money used to make coal cleaner should instead be spent scaling up wind power or installing

20090219180600AA642f5	Health;Dental	Questions on becomming a dentist?	Becomming a Dentist?   I know there's quite a few questions about becoming a dentist, but I just wanted to ask if you are already a dentist or know someone who is one, what college did they attend and what classes in high school did they take.    Right now im a 10th grade student    I take   Biology-Honors   and Geometry -Honors      just naming those since they are most vital when trying to become a dentist. So far my classes for 11th grade are set to be      Advanced.Trigonometry    and Chemistry Honors      To graduate high school here, all you need are algebra classes and geometry. So since i took all my algebra in middle school and im taking geometry this year,10th grade could be my last year for math;   or should i continue with Trig my junior year, and take up calculus my Senior year as well?      Same for chemistry, after i take that class next year i could be done with all science...or should i continue to physics my senior year.      any answer to my question would help =)

20090219183332AA0daEf	Health;Women's Health	I'm scared and I don't know what's wrong with my body :'(?	I don't know if all these symptoms are for one thing, but I've done some research and I think they're for different things.      Randomly I feel like my stomach is being ripped apart. Not my lower stomach though, just below my ribs.  I've lost my appetite, I'm really tired all the time, I'm kinda weak and I feel lazy.  These pains I feel are almost like a chest pain but below my ribs.   I researched and the internet said it might be an Ulcer.   I'm not pregnant there's no chance so scratch that.      The other symptoms I've been having are, I feel like I need to pee 3345642 times a day, but when I go to the washroom..I don't pee, and when I finally do it kind of burns a bit. When I'm just sitting here I feel kind of like a pulse in my genital area, like pressure almost, and when I push (like you're forcing a pee) it hurts.   I figured this might be a bladder infection.      Just recently, I went to the washroom and when I wiped there was blood.  Not a lot of blood like period blood but like pink and a little bit..   I don't know what this is from, and I checked for cuts or sores and ther isn't any.   Is this a bladder infection symptom? or Ulcer symptom?   Or what could it be.      Please give as much information as possible I'm really scared and I'm embarrassed to talk to my parents.

20090203112618AATMUUQ	Health;Mental Health	I feel like I can't pay attention well enough in school.?	I'm in 9th grade. Sometimes in class, I go off daydreaming and can't seem to pay attention even if I 'force' myself to. I guess I didn't realize how much better other people are able to pay attention than me, though. I still have good grades, all A's and one B. This is probably because I end up asking questions and retaking tests (In algebra) and I can catch on to stuff pretty quick. But I feel like I would be doing even better if I could just pay attention well. Could I have ADD/ADHD?      Other examples are that I can never pay attention through a whole movie, for instance in a movie theater there's always a point when I go off thinking of something and miss like 6 minutes of the movie in my daydreaming state.      And my teacher can be discussing something with a student, the classroom all quiet, and I wouldn't even hear what they're saying, really.      I admit I don't get quite enough sleep, but I'm pretty sure this happens even when I do.
20090203110635AAP22Cq	Health;Alternative Medicine	SO FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!!!!?	Ok So as you know from all my questions lol I have a pituitary tumor caused my risperdal I am now off it and my prolactin levels are back to normal!      ANYWAYS I don't think risperdal was what was making my periods irregular I had a regular 28 day cycle like clock work then when I got on bc it messed it up and made it come very light and only lasted 2 days like every two weeks. I got off bc and this continued. I stopped taking risperdal for awhile (before I knew I had a pituitary tumor) anyways whenever I did..my periods would come back to normal like clockwork agian! I got back on risperdal stupid not seein the connection. Anyways then I would still get light peiriods every 2 weeks. which was annoying. Then in April 2008 I started taking Vitex cause a friend said that would help...since then I havn't had a peiriod since. without the help of prometruim. I even got off my risperdal and my periods always came back to normal after that and this time didn't I think the vitex had something to do with it! I thought that was supposed to regulate! it made mine dissapear! The doctor said he doesn't think I should have any problem ttc..I will see him tomorrow but I'm so confused I don't think it's the tumor that is making the periods like this. I believe it was the vitex. How am I supposed to ttc when vitex vanished my period!

But i don't let it bother me anymore. Anyway, yes when he gets stressed at work he takes it out on me mostly. Today my mum brought some clothes home from a sale, she goes crazy at sales and told us to choose what we wanted. There was one pair of PJ's that looked really nice. The bags were given to us in the computer room and we were ment to go through them and choose, my sister of course had gotten out the PJ's and said i'm having these though. And i said there really nice, didnt you buy some PJ's a week ago? And she said yes but i want these. I have hardly no PJ's so i asked if i could have them. She got mad and we argued the whole time i was just telling her to have them because i didn't want to argue with her. She kept on and on and i shouted i don't care f*ck off, take what you want! I know thats innapropiate by i was wound up. My dad came running in and smacked me across the leg with a slipper and told me to stop being a rude little b*tch to my sister and to stop swearing. It really hurt as a had a bruise there before i sat down quietly waiting for him to leave the room. He went to my sister, fine if she don't want any.. She won't have any and walked out with her. My mum got really angry and now they are argueing about it and i feel like its my fault. I mean this isnt the first time, he often loses it with me but doesnt always actually touch me, especially when he didn't know what had gone on. I can't stop crying thinking this is my fault or if it is abuse. Please help me, I'm so confused. Thanks.

Being out of shape I walked 4 miles yesterday and a mile today. I know walking gives pain but when I looked up blood clot symptoms it said "if pain in groin and legs get medical help immediatly).    (Do females have groins?) If not I have pain in both legs and on the left side where the leg meets the abdomen inside. That fold in.   Is this a blood clot or walking pain?  If it's just walking pain then how come it's only on one side??? And not both folds in hurting? Am I at risk what's my chances of it being one?      I also walked 4 miles yesterday, freaked out about a blood clot last night so I didn't get sleep till 4am. Then woke up at 7am. (NO ONE ON HERE HELPED ME).. Then got up spent all day out and about and walked 1-2 miles again. On this no sleep. Still awake.

Its to early for a pregnancy test. I have an apt with my gyno March 2nd to talk to her about PMS problems. I'll probably end up getting blood work for pregnancy then just to make sure im not before i get some sort of medications.       Anyways, my question--   after a week of unprotected sex is there any signs?   The only thing i've really noticed is im tired and hungry, but that could be from stressing about college papers. But tonight i was on the phone talking to my boyfriend and i got this sudden sharp pain to the right of my belly button.. then later i had a faint light pain on the left (which im getting again right now).      did anyone experience this?   or am i just posting a pointless question      thanks for your answers  :)

By the way, I don't have a fever or discharge, so I don't think it's an infection.........

Every time she goes to the store she buys 2 huge bottles of wine and drinks 1 every night. Every time she drinks she fights with me, my father, and 2 brothers and she hits and punches and screams. For example, Last night I had a 101.0 fever and felt really really sick. So I was laying in bed watching t.v. when I hear her and my father arguing. So after it stops I hear her stomping down the stairs and she barges into my room. She snaps on my light (which really didn't help the horrible headache) and shuts off my t.v. and starts screaming "stop faking and start your homework!" and I'm like "it's one in the morning mom. and I'm not going to school tomorrow, I'm too sick." So she yanks off my bed covers and grabs my orange juice (which it was the last of our orange juice and that is the only thing that helps me feel better) and she starts gulping in down and gives my the most immature, childish, taunting face ever. so I say "mom stop! I need that!". When she finished it she just threw the cup on the ground, grabbed my cell phone and said "no cell phone, your grounded!" and walks out of my room leaving the light on, the cup on the ground, and the door open. and as she's walking down the hall I yell "mom that's not fair!' and she flips me off. That is what I have to deal with almost every night. When I try to talk to her about stopping she yells and turns it around on me. I'm sick of it and it is ruining My parents marriage and they have been married for over 20 years. I just want my mom back. Please help me!

20090219204349AAAoHF7	Health;Other - Health	When I stand up too fast? Frequency?	I know what is happening when I stand up too fast, but my question is how frequently is this supposed to happen? Because before recently, it would only happen to me maybe 3 times a week if that. But now, it happens almost everytime I stand up! In school, teachers and my fellow students worry about me cuz I almost tumble over and sometimes I trip over stuff. For the symptoms, I usually just black out, but remain standing, my whole body gets a tingly feeling and I go numb for a second or so. Then I remain balcked out with my arms outstretched for balance from anywhere from 3 seconds to around 15 seconds. Usually when it happens, I just stand still, open my eyes really wide, outstretch my arms, and wait it out.       But anyway, how frequently is this supposed to happen? It happens to me probably more than 6 times a day!

20090219205310AAxwsMm	Health;Mental Health	Have I done anything?	I turned 23 in September.  I have a B.A. in History from Rutgers.  I graduated with about a 3.0.  The best job I was offered was as an assistant manager at Target.  I make 45k/year, but I hate my  Effin' job so much.  I hate the rotating schedule, the long hours, working holidays, and the job as a whole so much.  I still live at home with my parents.  Yeah, I've been able to pay off $3,000 of credit card debt, and now saved $3,000, I still fell like crud.  I don't feel like I've done anything with my life.  I was thinking during my break tonight outside while I was sitting on the bench, "I'm an assistant manager at a Target in New Jersey, and my new 'project' at work is putting out summer wear over the next few days, with my Men's Lead and Ladies Leas.  Is this really my life?"  So....Have I done anything?  Someone please say yes ::::crosses fingers::::

I am eating healthy, I eat 1600 a day give a take a few calories they are balanced (50%carbs/30%protein/20% fat). Can anyone explain why i may not be losing weight (lbs.) and body fat?

If you do have oily skin, wash your hands (to get the moisturizer off your hands), get a washcloth or tissue and dab your face with it(dont rub off-it irritates the skin and can make problems way worse). then rub in again with your hands. i use this moisturizer everyday. at night, i apply a whole lot to my face and just let it absorb all throughout the night. i never have any problems with my dry skin.(eczema). i hope i have convinced at least some of u to give this a try!

It's like I get in these moods for a few days where I do really good and then all of a sudden I break down and give into my temptations. I know I have a problem, but I know there are others out there like me. So please help! thanks a lot.

I was watching the amazing Human Body on Discovery the other day and it was talking about how distance runners/swimmers bodies switch to burning their own body fat after about 2 or 3 hours when they are competing.  Is it possible for an ordinary person working out to help their bodies go into this zone?

20090219224311AAFVs5U	Health;Other - Health	Is marijuana associated with Deja Vu?	The other day I smoked marijuana for the first time (please hold the "don't do that" and stuff like that... it's already been done). But while I was high, a realized that every few seconds I would see a random object, and then a far-away memory would jump into my mind. Like, I would see a doorway and then think of a time back when I was, say, three, and my family and I were spending time in our cabin. I would see a road, and think about the streets I lived on back many years ago.   I mean, things would pop into my mind that I hadn't thought about for several years, or, ever! But it was all things that happened before, and it was like I was in that same setting again.   Has this ever happened to anyone else?

I had the flu for the past two days but i seem to be getting over it, and just experiencing the head cold portion of it now (sore throat, cough, etc). However, I woke up this morning with cramps in both of my calfs. These cramps are so bad I can barely walk without buckling. They have not gone away all day, what should I do? and is this common?
20090219224433AAWVAcW	Health;Men's Health	Is is possible that I *** without feeling it?	My girl and I just had sex earlier. I pumped hard and fast and I went on for about 45 minutes. I dunno, but I wasn't satisfied or even felt like I was coming. She was nervous because she told me that I might not have felt it and I exploded inside her. I know my body too well and I know that it's impossible not to sense that you are no climaxing or even coming. Am I suffering from a medical condition or I *** and didn't felt it?
