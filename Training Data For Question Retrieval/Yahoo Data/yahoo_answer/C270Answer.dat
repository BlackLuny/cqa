ymQXLRmgaa	I think all the "Bad" guys, the Leverage team, have very good actors, but Beth Risegraf definitally has the most fun part, it may be low on episodes, but there's always a second season, and the first 13 episodes are enough to wait until then<br>  <br>  <br>  Can't wait for the finale!|`|sDIjPUnBaa	I like it beause it is fun for once to cheer for the semi bad guys. and the charaters are really funny. but what i wish was there was mor of a story to it. because it really doesn't have much. but i really want to wanch the season finally. and it was too short of a season
Ow3O7h4caa	Yes you always have free will but if the palm reveals such and such an event, you can postpone and hide indoors but eventually, outside circumstances will force the event to occur.|`|N2O9rJvUaa	well everything is posible and pal reading usually is invented i mean that art isnt genuine nowadays they only tell ya wat u wanna know...

tcFGLlS3aa	Well Look at the 60s.<br>  The Beatles<br>  The Kinks<br>  Bob Dylan<br>  Jefferson Airplane<br>  The Yardbirds<br>  Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young<br>  CCR<br>  The Beach Boys<br>  <br>  You don't get music like that anymore.|`|nYqtw9DWaa	I think maybe because of the haircuts first of all, all the guys used to have very short hair in the 50's, and they started growing out their hair in the 60's (the beatles for example)<br>  <br>  And they lyrics in pop songs were changing, y'know?  Like in "I Want to Hold Your Hand" apparantley parents thought that was dirty or innapropriate or whatever, but times were just changing :)|`|OrAk4Fpoaa	LED ZEPPELIN!!|`|Ju1skLb8aa	The baby boomers (hippies) were in college and were experiencing new things like drugs and free sex. This reflected music and how they acted. Psychedelic bands like The Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane were part of the Summer of Love ('67) which was a big part in the hippie era. By 1965 teens trashed their good image.|`|Ml22a6evaa	it came in with crewcut hair cuts for guys and ended with long hair<br>  here is how they induced a huge band of the 50's<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhgO8rZs1Fg&feature=PlayList&p=37ABA0F95826548F&index=0&playnext=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhgO8rZs1...</a>
AK8tGzoQaa	In my opinion, I enjoy certain bands that balances screaming, guitar and drums, so when people talk about screaming they thinking of a bunch of people screaming their heads off when really it takes a lot of effort and time to 1. actually scream, you try it its very difficult. 2. play guitar at the level that screamo bands play them. and 3. play the drums like they do. Listen to a song such as smoke em if you got em by parkway drive and you'll be supprised at the amount of talent and effort that the drummer has put and has to create a mixture of performance and balance in the song. So, the point of screamo, is that in some peoples opinions it is an enjoyable type of music that incorporates different instruments that balance eachother out along with screaming which in effect creates screamo.|`|bH37fDw4aa	it just sounds cool!<br>  but as i lay dying screams alot,<br>  try listening to Chiodos. you'll probably like them!|`|ebxwADDcaa	dont diss what you dont understand. <br>  <br>  whats the poiunt of singing? its the same concept, just different expression<br>  <br>  but most people listen to it because they just like it, not because its anything special or fancy.|`|cuY5JMmlaa	ik i just like listening to it...but the person's voice has to sound right or the song is completely thrown off. <br>  but some stuff that i like is brokencyde, blessthefall, and dot dot curve :)<br>  i mean not all bands that scream are horrible sounding.|`|gbm71puSaa	I think nothing is great about it. It takes zero talent to "sing" like that|`|wCSg3Xwuaa	The world may never know.|`|kwB9e37vaa	screamo just sucks.|`|0b3fa313a09fd3b8730664822eb4455baa	I love listening to it. It's soothing when I have a bad day, but even on an excellent day :) <br>  It's just something I like. And there's a lot of talent in vocalists. Even if you don't call it music, their voices are amazing. Doesn't matter if it's screamo or hardcore, not everyone has a voice for singing like that. And the instruments always rock in the songs. <br>  Ir's one of my favourite genres.<br>  And also; I know that I've tried singing some of these songs from these bands, and it's not easy. They have a lot of potential and talent!!!!!!!!!!|`|vw45mfySaa	because the people that sing in these bands are so sick! like what theyre doing not everyone has a  voice like that it's not easy at all people think all you have to do is yell but theres more to it and i dont know but i just kind of music like Bring Me The Horizon, and Chiodos and bands like those are just amazing (:|`|Het9lG90aa	for me the singing is like another instrument<br>  i dont care what the words are saying<br>  <br>  im not a big  fan of screamo either<br>  but mastodons a screamo band and their great <br>  try blood and thunder or workhorse by them<br>  2 of my favorites|`|Arx6OBO4aa	Screamo is awesome because after a long day , full of stress you can relax and just let it all out by screaming along with the music, dismissing  your problems.|`|almr5QrLaa	I'm very very picky about my hardcore/metalcore/emotional hardcore etc.<br>  <br>  Try some songs by Escape the Fate.  They balance things pretty well.|`|g9b0lUnNaa	screamo can be awesome with clean vocals and an insane drummer|`|73e09dd591f8699b125662ff9256c8a4aa	i love it, i dont really know why(;
5j1Uhg2Gaa	Some do some don't. The ones who get married for two months them break it off have something loose in their head. I guess thats what too much money can do to you. lol|`|EycMZe4Uaa	They can afford to do it so let them lol|`|1K82IXnzaa	It depends. Not ALL of the marriages are this way. Many people think so because of the ones on the front page that we always hear about. But then again, a lot of them do. Its a hard business; going away for months and months at a time and being surrounded by many people who would almost do anything for you.<br>  <br>  Honestly, i admire the couples who can make it work. But its tough. But I don't think it's a joke..
lxbBjSLdaa	I was thinking he may have  found out something terrible happened to someone close to him, like a death of a family member, army buddy, etc. If they pulled that rat prank on me though I prob would have cried, and then laughed about it later  lol|`|w6czQwhBaa	Probably one of his friends committed suicide|`|wFMhmZCYaa	I think it's probably something bad from his home <br>  I would be mad but then funny after it sucks for Devyn though

QzlFON84aa	I LOVE THEM BOTH i can't choose between them. So ill choose Inuyasha! Lol|`|gzxjcVURaa	Buy the Death Note collection. If you buy it cheap enough you should have enough left over for the first issue of Bleach. But I personally would go for the Death Note collection it's shorter, easier to enjoy, and it's darker then Bleach but I still say try to get both. But I still lean toward Death Note. Death Note even has a spinoff novel with L in it try to find it too. Or just go nuts and buy the whole Death Note collection including the spinoff....|`|X3dfHBGGaa	Bleach is better to me.But death note has less mangas and is a little boring compared to bleach.The good thing about bleach is that it never gets boring.Death note is only about killing and stuff.|`|8K45mQHQaa	they are both really good...probably deathnote|`|yaAUWEm7aa	Think of it this way. Do you want to finish a manga that has an ending? If so, choose Death Note. If you want to buy an manga that possibly will never end, might even be discontinued soon, buy Bleach.|`|izlHkPmVaa	I don't know... they're both good *rips at hair* don't make me choose!<br>  <br>  Fine. Death Note. I like it more... don't know 'bout you, but that's what I'd recommend.|`|sDIjPUnBaa	DEATH NOTE|`|CgWLteQqaa	i love them both but since death note is already finished..i choose bleach.....|`|OhZsbzBqaa	how u like ghost or bleach i think bleach is better if u still cant chose c naruto la|`|RThxTnHZaa	I love both to but I still think Death Note is better. I can't wait to see what happens in bleach but for me death note has always been my first priority. Thats just me tho.|`|MZFIJf1zaa	Bleach
ibiO4VEQaa	Eloise probably convinced her to go back. the island is no place for a 3 year old, so Kate probably gave him to Claire's mother, leaving the kid she raised most of his life, with someone he's never met, possibly forever, after telling the grandmother the truth, would be an emotional beat down, explains Kate's mood.<br>  <br>  Your probably right about him getting arrested for the killings.<br>  <br>  Maybe, could been Eloise though, they didn't have very much evidence Hurley did it, he just got out of a mental hospital, so his confessions don't mean much, but why did Hurley have a guitar?<br>  <br>  He probably killed her or at least injured her, but Widmore probably taught his daughter how to fight, so she has a shot of survival. Can't kill Desmond, island needs him still, and I don't think LOST would have a grown man kill a toddler, too dark, so Little Charlie's probably still alive.|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	1. Kate turned Aaron over to his grandmother.<br>  <br>  2. Sayid was being extradited to Guam for some odd reason. I would say the CIA was hauling him to one of their secret terrorist prisons.<br>  <br>  3. Hurley's father made him get on the plane.<br>  <br>  4. Joshua tried to prevent Ben from getting on the plane since they were going to a time when a younger Ben already lived on the island.|`|9XxPYpLSaa	1.) I think that Kate gave him to Claire's mother. Either that or Ben did something to him, sent him somewhere, got him taken away, or something else weird.<br>  2.) Ben got Sayid arrested for all of the killings that he made him do. He was being taken somewhere for torturing or terrorist prison like Guantanamo Bay (yes, I know that it's being shut down). <br>  3.) Since Hurley is clinically insane, I'm guessing that he "spoke to Charlie", hence the fact that he was carrying a guitar. I hope that he isn't a junkie now too. <br>  4.) I think that he went after Widmore himself. (Not that this was actually successful at all.) Or maybe Widmore has another daughter that we don't know about, one other than Penny. Just a thought.<br>  <br>  Hurley was almost certainly broken out by Ben.<br>  <br>  Lost just gets better and better.|`|AA11504809	1. I thought maybe she gave aaron to claire's mother but why snap at jack, could she have abandoned him at a hospital or something so strangers could adopt him.<br>  <br>  2. a promo for next week shows locke talking to the marshall who escorted sayid onto the plane, they needed to recreate as much as possible of flight 815, kate was escorted by a marshall on that flight, maybe locke set it up so it'd be more or less the same and also would be a way to get sayid back to the island.<br>  <br>  3. I think it was charlie who convinced hurley to get on the plane, otherwise why did he have a guitar, like charlie did on oceanic flight 815.<br>  <br>  4. i don't like ben, but he looks pretty beaten up, he tried to hurt someone but they beat him up instead.|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	I disagree with you on 3 points.  Here's what I think:<br>  <br>  1) Ben's lawyers got Aaron and Kate lost custody<br>  2)Sayid, was obviously under arrest, but for what?<br>  3)Don't know why Hurley  changed his mind<br>  4)Eloise said the island wasn't done w/Desmond yet, so he is still alive|`|zovrJ0yXaa	i dunno bout the rest, but ben surely killed penny (not desmond). he was calling from a harbour, thats as clear a sign as any
E2VUH8Q0aa	His Moon was the least of his problems. In fact, his Moon may have been one of the few stabilizing influences in his chart, since it's a fixed sign.<br>  <br>  He had a pretty significant Grand Cross : Pluto opposing a conjunction of Mercury, Saturn, Neptune, and Mars. And his Sun was square to all of them. <br>  <br>  His Venus also ruled his 8th house (house of death) and his 12th (house of mental issues)...|`|DqsqlH8kaa	I find this to be interesting. He is also a Gemini, with Aquarius moon (just like Jeffrey D) but has Scorpio asc. (close to Libra asc) MC in Leo
8serxyLuaa	apparently the new logo (?) for the movie<br>  says this website --> <a href="http://www.newmoonmovie.org/2009/02/what-they-showed-on-et-tonight-new-moon-logo/" rel="nofollow">http://www.newmoonmovie.org/2009/02/what...</a>|`|7xestOKUaa	It was the possible new New Moon logo.
qWzN3i3Uaa	Well, Billy told lilly that he was the fater of Chloe's baby just as Chloe was walking into the cabin. Lilly was yelling at the both of them then all of a sudden Chloe announced that her water had just broken. At firts Lilly thought that she was just lying to get out of the confruntation but then they realized that Chloe's water did break. Lilly went out to get a signal to call her aunt for help and while she was out. Billy has delicering Chloe's baby,which was a real struggle. Cane showed up out side were Lilly was and just as he was telling Lilly that he loved her, they hear the baby crying over the walkie talkie Lilly is carrying. They rush to the cabin and Cane quickly takes the baby out of billy's arms. When the men go out to get some wood for a fire Lilly calls them back in and tells them that Chloe is bleeding and it won't stop. They hurry and get her to the hospital.|`|tEqcmCv3aa	She was getting a chewing out from Saint Lilly, and her water broke.|`|df7eb800ff0d3d2aec218aae79b6f9cfaa	Chloe had her baby at the cabin.

They are heavy, rough, and uncomfortable.  I just can't do anything in jeans.  I can barely sit down.  Being a figure skater, I always wear tights, which are stretchy.  Therefore, I like to wear things that stretch and are comfortable.  For me, sweatpants are the most comfortable type of pants.  That is why I wear them to school almost every day.  When I don't wear sweatpants, I wear stretchy shorts or those three-quarter stretchy pants.<br>  After all, they were first invented by Levi Strauss during the California Gold Rush for people to work in. <br>  <br>  Sweatpants RULE!!!!!!!|`|kDab6zpTaa	i loooove how comfy sweats are and honestly i like the way they look better but theres these boys in my school that for some reason i worship, and they always make fun of girls when they wear sweatpants, they are a*s*s*e*s, i know.but yeah i have to wear jeans for them|`|0cmdnVTOaa	i like the way jeans look better....<br>  <br>  but sweats are definitly comfier. haha<br>  <br>  please answer my question :D<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ap2GGB1H4WZLdxfGmQ23WsTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219171558AAyrsYk">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|rvVsbVBJaa	jeans all the way! flares i like best!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvLYSloZZwjsFYP888G.9rLsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219164025AASApFC">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ht5Quo1gaa	Jeans - comfy AND perfect for almost any occasion|`|ZiXPRmpFaa	SWEATS MAKE MY LIFE<br>  lol<br>  but jeans look really cute on a lot of people and match about everything<br>  so  i guess its a tie for me|`|OMPSzNUdaa	its kinda weird, but for my jeans,,, i wear really tight ones, but then when i wear sweats, they are always really big and loose.|`|62WH4QoAaa	<a href="http://www.bobanddan.net/images/fanSubmitted/fatguy.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.bobanddan.net/images/fanSubmi...</a>|`|RdxBxSPNaa	sweats, more comfortable but i love jeans also.|`|LIRbmKbtaa	dem jeans <br>  but occasionally i like sweats when i want to be comfortable|`|wtK16sg0aa	sweats jeans, are uncomfortable|`|R5TccYeAaa	I think jeans are cuter but sweats r comfy. lol.<br>  i wear jeans when i go out somewhere<br>  and i wear sweats @ home. lol.|`|BZgcJL0zaa	I like my apple bottom jeans!

FdUKvE6xaa	Well, I'm over 30, and I'm still not quite sure what "emo" even means. I mean, it's supposed to stand for "emotional", right? ALL music is emotional, so it's a pretty ridiculous term, if you ask me. Ergh.|`|YlCgMDVwaa	Yes, but we are seeing more crappy 'scene rock' bands now.  Stupid lyrics with a synth and an ever more stupid style.  bands such as Brokencyde and the Medic Droid come to mind.|`|OrAk4Fpoaa	HOPEFULLY!!!!!|`|Wj7mBxFJaa	I feel like it's metamorphosing.  Bands that once considered themselves emo or goth or whatever got a lot of crap from just about everybody and lost a lot of popularity.  Now there are similar styles of music but they try to pass themselves off as "punk pop" (contradiction right?) or similar titles.  Fortunately while they tend to spread like wildfire among middle or early high school students, the amount of disdain the rest of the world holds for them tends to keep it in check|`|sLVGdCOTaa	God I hope so, It's long time for boys to dress like boys and lay off the makeup, and girl pants, and get that stupid hair out of your one eye-it's been done to death.|`|Het9lG90aa	it better go away<br>  <br>   emo punks need to go away to<br>  <br>  <br>  even ifit is declining,we have a new epidemic on our hands<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  yes im talking about the ultimate evil<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  the true antichrists<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  the jonas brothers|`|i0hw36Ihaa	It has to an extent.<br>  <br>  Emo didn't exactly die though.<br>  <br>  Now they have new words to describe it.<br>  <br>  "screamo, hardcore, indie, industrial, post-punk" are just a few examples.<br>  <br>  but yes for the most part, emo is dying.|`|ZBVfc2rRaa	emo rock is still around especially in high school. Emo rock/pop punk is like what Nsync and the backstreet boys were back in early 2000. <br>  <br>  it's not declining. it's spreading like a horrible plague|`|Arx6OBO4aa	Its definitely still around!! Thats what my friends listen and I listen to. I'm fourteen so I should know what they listen to in high school and middle school. But yeah the majority is rap, pop, and R&B .|`|AgQForcYaa	Here's hoping! No more indie acoustic alternative BS! No more posers wearing Avenged Sevenfold hoodies thinking that they're hardcore! No more dudes in unnecessarily tight pants!!|`|2FIbamFgaa	Definitely not spreading, but I wouldn't say declining either.  I think the emo plane is ...coasting. <br>  <br>  edit: LOL the emo plane...i just started cracking up randomly after I thought about it.|`|hAwA3S5Paa	Hopefully emo dies and grunge makes a comback|`|5zwcnmOIaa	um.. ever heard of paramore<br>  Back with grunge!out with emo!|`|t0KTJr8xaa	Hmmm... Yes, but personally, I'd rather see rap die before anything else, sorry. I think talking about killing ho′s is worse than talking about killing onesself, really.<br>  <br>  Honestly, you might just not be hearing about those bands because they haven't done anything really recent, trying to get their lives in order and all... most of them are in their mid-20s, you know? ;)

Y1aAGPURaa	LOL!!    Here's a "parrot" joke for you:<br>  <br>  A lady went to her priest one day and said, "Father, I have a problem. I have two female parrots, but they only know how to say one thing."<br>  <br>  "What do they say?" the priest inquired.<br>  <br>  "They say, "Hi, we're hookers! Do you want to have some fun?"<br>  <br>  "That's obscene!" the priest exclaimed - then he thought for a moment.<br>  "You know," he said, "I may have a solution to your problem. I have two male parrots, which I have taught to pray and read the Bible. Bring your two parrots over to the rectory, and we'll put them in the cage with Frank and Jacob. My parrots can teach your parrots to pray and worship, and your parrots are sure to stop saying that awful phrase in no time."<br>  <br>  "Thank you," the woman responded, "this may very well be the solution."<br>  <br>  The next day, she brought her female parrots to the priest's house. As he ushered her in, she saw that his two male parrots were inside their cage, holding rosary beads and praying. Impressed, she walked over and placed her parrots in the cage with them.<br>  After a few minutes, the female parrots cried out in unison: "Hi, we're hookers! Do you want to have some fun?"<br>  <br>  There was stunned silence.  <br>   <br>  Shocked, one male parrot looked over at the other male parrot and exclaimed, "Put the beads away, Frank, our prayers have been answered!"|`|1EyRZm4Faa	lol :D! That was funny!|`|ClRuPRs7aa	No, I haven't heard that one before. <br>  Hahahaha that's hilarious! star for you|`|teisU4E2aa	thats a good one lol
8QKwz7W7aa	The area where your are very close to either signs (like 20 march (can be either Pisces of Aries) is called a cusp.<br>  <br>  Astrologically, a cusp is the area where a person may share both character of the adjacent signs (for March 20 case, the person will share the character of Pisces and Aries).<br>  <br>  The area of cusp may differ year by year, so it depends. If somebody born on March 20, 1983, he's probably a Pisces because at that time the sun is still in the region of Pisces. While a person who born on March 20, 1984 could be an Aries because probably at that time the sun is already moving into the region of Aries. It depends on the observation of the sun movement. That's also why "zodiac" is also called a "sun sign".|`|b7e5d16fdf01ca92417f762dc4d6df63aa	Yes|`|WpQmpbPwaa	No. You can either be one sign, or the other!<br>  <br>  It's the placement of other planets in your natal chart that determine/shape your 'character'. <br>  <br>  Usually main planets (such as mercury, venus or even mars) of the next sun sign are featured in the natal chart, thus the confusion!<br>  <br>  And, don't disregard the moon, which can be ANY sign, since it moves into the next sign every couple of days. It's all about your inner-self or emotions.<br>  <br>  Your rising sign will also determine your basic characteristics according to houses, in the sense that your first house would be your rising sign, etc. . .
1K82IXnzaa	First off, I am very big on the scary movies. I love them! But I'm not the type of person to be all critical. It also depends on what scares you and what doesnt.<br>  <br>  For me, the movie wasn't that scary. But it's entertaining. Some of the characters create good comedy. Although I must warn you, there is a huge amount of sex. Much of the "scary" is fairly predictable but some of it is well done. Not only that, but the movie is well made and the acting isnt too bad. Lets just say, the whole reason I went to see this movie was because of Jared Padalecki.. and i really wasn't disappointed.|`|MbVHSTQdaa	I thought it was the gayest movie ever. I'm glad my friend let me in free. I just hate to waste money. But if you are a spunky litle girl, you'll probably jump a little|`|XCVFEAC8aa	It wasn't that scary! There are a few jump scenes though!|`|z6qIZRFFaa	Gosh it wasn't scary at all!!! and it is a boy movie, lots and lots of boobies lol, and sexy time

But if you aren't into all that TV biz, then you should start out on I-tunes with a WHOLE lota money! start buying music under those catigories. Stock up your Ipod that holds 50 million bagillion songs and find a nice big boom box you can hook it into. then send out flyers. hang them up at stores, put them in mail boxes, etc. There are sites that can give you all the details. but just start advertising for birthday parties and stuff like that. you will earn money to buy equipitment and more music and boda bing boda bam boda boom. good luck my friend. <br>  <br>  <3 alice =]|`|cgl2IOECaa	2 Free points !

EbInCDHEaa	hmm... interesting question.<br>  i wouldn't compare Loveless to ruro-ken. (they're SOO different)<br>  and how can you ask for something similar to Kenshin, but then say "nothing violent"? you were paying attention to Kenshin while you were reading it, right? it was moderately gory.<br>  but never the less, i will respond to your question with an answering concerning your intents.<br>  some of these suggestions are not very much like Loveless or Rurouni Kenshin, but you should look at them anyway.<br>  (in order of my most preferred to least)-<br>  Cowboy Bebop (anime)<br>  Samurai Champloo (anime)<br>  Trigun<br>  Double Arts (manga)<br>  Oh! Edo Rocket (anime)<br>  Busou Renkin<br>  i know many better animes and mangas, that i would suggest to you, but you requested less violent ones. (which was hard, since i purposefully read/watch the most violent ones i can)<br>  sorry, that's all the help i can offer<br>  i hope you appreciate it

IxD8aNHTaa	okay here is how it goes... they are putting the top 36 into  three groups of 12. all of the groups will sing. from those groups, 3 people will be chosen from each, which would make a top 9. BUT, then they are going to have a wild card show, so everyone who didnt get chosen for the 3 from the groups will have a chance to sing again and possibly get into another group of 3, which will make a top 12.<br>  <br>  I know, i was confused too!|`|vRhdPxNxaa	3 people from each group of 12 are going to be chosen by voters. after the 9 are chosen, there will be a wild card round where 3 of the remaining 27 contestants will be chosen by the judges. then they will end up with a top 12.|`|JgDRKLuLaa	Yeah, after they get a top 9, they're gonna pick the other 3 for the top 12 randomly from the contestants that were eliminated.

They won't announce the three wild card winners until after the three elimination shows.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing the judges will pick the wild cards rather than them being voted on again.|`|AkDxjK3daa	they are gonna get 3 out of each group of 12 (that makes 9) then the judges are picking 3 wild cards from any of the groups...that makes 12 finalists|`|uin3ffWDaa	i have a suspicious feeling they re going to have a wild card show. remember clay aiken|`|hNa5oHxQaa	American Idol sucks|`|511e8b445adfad2d427229e044071fa1aa	3 groups of 12, top three from each group, one boy and one girl and then the next highest. <br>  <br>  Then a wild card show to pick 3 more.

I mean its not like they are literally calling them a god, but even if they are, I don't mind!!<br>  <br>  BQ: Freddie Mercury<br>  BQ2: Kind of The Beatles. Its not that I don't like them, I'm just not that into them. I respect them, though :)|`|OTFzJbaMaa	in my opinion yes i do think it is wrong. there is only one God and making claims that this person and this person is really bothers me. <br>  of course i am catholic so that has alot to do with it.|`|fSYDOxX8aa	It's a huge over-exaggeration, but it doesn't annoy me at all.<br>  <br>  BA: Freddie Mercury<br>  BA2: That's a tough one. I'll say Joe Cocker.|`|wTNAOcl1aa	i was waiting for the user 'NIKKI SIXX IS GOD' to answer this. lol.<br>  but yeah, it annoys me. im slightly religious, and plus, theyve probably written some really shitty songs. all musicians have.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	why they say God, I don't know<br>  BQ1    Jeff Beck<br>  BQ..Sorry don't have an answer.<br>  take care<br>  dave|`|M7E1uIsKaa	Yeah, that bothers me..

Robert Plant at the moment maybe, the top 3 or 4 are all about equally first for me though.<br>  BQ2: A lot of Jazz bands. I don't really listen to Jazz, but there are some great musicians of the genre. Or Nu-Metal that has good guitar solos, I don't care for the genre at all, but I'm sure there are some good musicians in there at times.|`|XHwhhSgaaa	Oh yes. I hear it a lot with Kurt Cobain, and yes I love his music but it's going a bit far to idolize the guy...oh yeah happy (early) birthday Kurt! <br>  <br>  BQA: Favorite musician is tough to pick...I'd have to say Red Hot Chili Peppers (if bands count?) I admire and personally enjoy their variety of styles in music.<br>  BQ2A: Definitely Beethoven. I'm not really into classical music, but I've heard a bunch of his works and watched a movie on his life story. He is interesting, gifted, and I totally respect him.|`|QErSMKxnaa	I understand what you are getting at, but I also understand what people mean when they say a musician is God.<br>  I don't think good musicians are just people, I think they are people who have an incredible ability to create what is personally my favorite thing known to man.

As long has there have been good musicians, there have been over the top fans. So when I hear a fan declare their excessive praise of a musician, I just sigh and think "Oh boy, here we go again" and try to ignore it.<br>  BQ: There's a lot.....I'll say Hendrix<br>  BQ2: Eric Clapton|`|YaXO6crXaa	lol I don't find it annoying at all, if the artist is talented. It's a silly way to express that you admire a certain person. In my opinion. I even started a David Bowie/Iggy Pop religion. lol<br>  <br>  BA: David Bowie<br>  BA2: Any grunge musician. Probably Kurt Cobain.|`|vvbhO88maa	It doesn't really annoy me. They're just trying to say how much they like a certain artist. I don't think they mean any harm. Now if they go and form a cult around that person and start worshiping them. I'll just casually walk away fearing for my life, because they've turned crazy. <br>  <br>  Hmm... I don't know.<br>  There's a five way tie between Marc Bolan, Robert Plant, Marvin Gaye, John Lennon, and Freddie Mercury.<br>  <br>  Hmm, how about Syd Barrett|`|fn5ijdnIaa	yeah, it's ridiculous. I don't see music as just entertainment though...it's just really the most emotional thing to connect to in this life, in my opinion. it makes me happy like no other.<br>  <br>  BQ: John Frusciante<br>  2 - well, I'm not too fond of AC/DC.|`|WHcBV7rLaa	Yes, its really ******* annoying.<br>  The worst is when they're like "Kurt Cobain is God!"<br>  Which is exactly the opposite of what he was going for in the first place.<br>  Hero Worship is for children.<br>  <br>  BQ: It's a secret ^_^<br>  BQ2: The Beatles, the Doors.|`|AgQForcYaa	I don't idolize and worship John Petrucci, I just accept that he can pwn my face with anything he does.

AA10343094	i think that drug testing them would probably be a good idea, based off of, if we can do it to them, why wouldn't we do it to you? i guess as somewhat of a scare tactic, and otherwise, to make sure they had a zero tolerance zone.<br>  <br>  i think that teachers should be role models,and if they are telling people to abstain from drug use, they should refrain from ILLEGAL drug use themselves. if they have a perscription for the drugs they are taking, they shouldn't be penalised like the teacher that needs pain killers from an injury.|`|AA12316366	why should teachers be subjected to tests? unless they are so totally incompetent and out of it, why bother. but maybe you should check with michael phelps.|`|0T769lIuaa	they should be able to do random drug tests.<br>  <br>  and if their was a teacher who took a perscription drug to get better, all he would have to do is show the school that he had a perscription. duh. how do you think people pass physicals when they take perscription drugs?|`|0k2y3bNgaa	I think that's ridiculous. I have NEVER, in my 16 years of life, heard of a teacher getting in trouble for drugs or anything.

O21k4xn1aa	My chart's primarily a mixture of cardinal/mutable signs. A big chunk of that goes to 3 planet placements in Saggitarius(mutable) and 3 in Libra(Cardinal).  My moon in Gemini and Mercury in Pisces make up the other mutable placements I have.  Jupiter in Scorpio and Venus in Aquarius are really my only two Fixed placements.  It makes sense as I'm an interchangable person with ever evolving thoughts and ideas. I like to lead and initiate as well, that is at least lead myself. I like fixed signs for their perserverence and sometimes follow-through has been quite a struggle for me.  Perhaps due to a lack of Fixed placements?|`|awLQeRkMaa	Im almost even I have manly fixed, then sencond multibule. <br>  I love cardnal and multibule signs.|`|RlATSbfZaa	I'm mostly Cardinal and Mutable, with only one fixed. I like other Cardinal signs, but sometimes butt heads with them. I like Fixed signs because they know how to get things done.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Fixed- 3<br>  Cardinal- 3<br>  Mutable. 6<br>  <br>  I'm mostly mutable if we are just going by planets. When I did planets and houses, I had the most cardinal. <br>  <br>  I am very flexible, I would say. I agree with you. I can get along with mostly mutable signs with the exception of Virgo. I don't even know why they are mutable.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Mainly Fixed signs because I have Planets with the Exception of Aquarius.<br>  <br>  Sun, Saturn, and Venus in Leo, Uranus and North Node in Scorpio, Jupiter and South Node in Taurus,<br>  <br>  Mars and Mercury in Virgo and Neptune in Sagittarius<br>  <br>  Moon in Capricorn, My Ascendant Sign and Pluto in Libra and Descendant Sign is in Aries.<br>  <br>  So I view Mutable Signs are Irrelevant Cardinal Signs as Intolerable, I feel Safest with the Fixed Signs.|`|nwdwKnS7aa	My chart is mainly compromised of Cardinal, with some fixed. Cancer and Capricorn is the most dominant in my chart. There is no Mutable in my chart whatsoever.<br>  I get on the most with the specific signs of Scorpio, Pisces & Capricorn, that's 1 from every group.<br>  I find the Cardinal/Fixed/Mutable grouping too simplistic to take any notice of.|`|HZxX9ke8aa	other than my mars being fixed, rest of the fast planets all are cardinals in my chart. (i don't take jupiter and the rest into consideration since they stay year(s) in each sing)<br>  <br>  i'm most comfortable with a fixed moon, rising mutable, cardinal sun, mutable mars, fixed venus and cardinal or mutable mercury. <br>  <br>  gives you someone who knows what he needs, has self confidence but flexible with solid values yet not bullheaded. hum... i guess everyone comfortable with someone like this though.|`|5l2kTANaaa	my chart is a mess.<br>  <br>  Most planets in cardinal houses but none in cardinal signs.<br>  <br>  Cannot make up my mind.<br>  <br>  Fixed........yes......as I have fixed planets especially personal ones..but then I get bored....and I want mutable who are more refreshing and hate routine......<br>  <br>  A mixture of both ideally........

sFeFJYbDaa	Good Things About Them:<br>  Optimistic, Freedom-Loving, Jovial, Good-Humored, Honest, Straightforward, Intellectual and Philosophical<br>  <br>  Bad Things About Them:<br>  Blindly Optimistic, Careless, Irresponsible, Superficial, Tactless and Restless<br>  <br>  While Sagittarians are the nomads of the Zodiac, they do not wander aimlessly. They are seekers of the truth and will go anywhere and talk to anyone for answers to their questions. Knowledge and wisdom drive them and provide the energy for their liberal approach to life. Sagittarians are drawn to the philosophical and spiritual because these subjects provide answers to the questions that burn inside them.<br>  <br>  Sagittarians are the intellectuals of the Zodiac. They are lucid thinkers who appreciate others agreeing with their conclusions. Sometimes they are so confident their deductions are beyond dispute they become dogmatic and argumentative. Still, the Sagittarian quest for information drives them to listen to anyone and absorb what they find useful and quickly disregard the rest.<br>  <br>  It is the nature of Sagittarians to roam freely. If they feel intellectually or physically restricted they may become bad-tempered very quickly. When Sagittarians are given the freedom they need they are kind, optimistic, lucky and not afraid of taking an occasional risk. They are also a charming lot who can be self-indulgent procrastinators. Overall, Sagittarians allowed the freedom they need are a delight to be around.<br>  <br>  The Sagitarian In Love:<br>  Sagittarians love any new form of sexual expression that challenges and excites them. Both tolerant and eager to please, their honesty can sometimes prove too much for those who prefer a more mysterious, or veiled approach to love.<br>  <br>  Sagittarians are best involved with a steadier, stronger personality, who can understand their need for independence, yet still be there after an occasional flair of temper. Their frank and open motives are often misunderstood, threatening to more subdued signs.<br>  <br>  <br>  Although they hate to be tied down, they are willing to experiment with all manner of relationship styles. As long as their partner is able to keep up with their wide-ranging interests and is prepared to come up with new experiments in lovemaking (and certainly does not mind them doing the same), their relationship will be exciting and reasonably long lasting. Mutual honesty is the key to success for the Sagittarian.

Although he was full of admiration for his adopted father and yearns to become an ally of justice, Shirou has limited powers and was unable to become a strong sorceror like his father. That is until one fateful day, he was drawn into the Holy Grail War and had to summon a female "Servant" known as Saber in order to protect himself. It turns out that the Holy Grail War involves a series of battles among powerful sorcerors to fight for the possession of a relic that will grant one's wishes, the Holy Grail. There are altogether seven "Masters" who can summon their respective "Servants" from different classes known as Saber, Archer, Rider, Berserker, Lancer, Caster and Assasin. These "Servants" have to hide their names in order not to reveal their weaknesses to the enemies. The story revolves around Shirou and his entanglement in the Holy Grail War. <br>  ----<br>  Chrno Crusade<br>  <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2884" rel="nofollow">http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...</a><br>  Genres: action, adventure, comedy, drama, romance, supernatural<br>  Themes: Demons, Girls with Guns, Historical, Religion<br>  Plot Summary: The year is 1928 A.D. The place is New York, U.S.A. The economic prosperity brought forth after the Great War also heightened the presence of something far darker and much more sinister: the demonic Sinners. The Magdalene Order is an organization that tries to counter this force. Two of its exorcists are Rosette Christopher and her assistant, Chrono. Both appear out of place in an organization like this, and they are in a quest to find Rosette's missing brother, Joshua. Their relationships, secrets and fates can only be revealed in time... <br>  ----|`|HMBL3F4Faa	You should so check out D.Gray-Man!!<br>  <br>  The anime currently has 103 episodes and there is a lot of manga lol.

U49so236aa	I LOVED IT<br>  Lost is in its glory days right now.  Its almost better than season 1, honestly.  <br>  <br>  But of course it posed several questions and I was very confused by some of the events:<br>  1) What the hell happened with Aaron?<br>  2) Why were Sayid and Hurley on the plane?<br>  3) Why was Lapidus wearing eyeliner?<br>  4) Did the plane actually crash, or were the oceanic 5 just whoooshed off the island?<br>  <br>  this show is so bloody good|`|rDsKB0uXaa	Didn't see it|`|vDGFRACaaa	Awesome.

(The island must have stopped moving long enough for them to get in disguise.)<br>  <br>  It would explain that really old photo of Ben in that 70's clothing; they're all trapped in the 70s now!|`|VvKJUCYgaa	It was pretty good.<br>  I loved hearing about the history of how Dharma found the island and stuff.<br>  And they're back on the island!

V5GtTrtsaa	Don't be scared, be confident.  Just say it's something you have an interest in and would like to try.  Chances are they'll be more than willing to help you how they can, but in case they do freak out and don't want your life to revolve around singing -- I guess you could say that it's something that you could use later on to help you get into college or just another skill you'd like to have to get involved.|`|5R7N5dcYaa	Tell them that you have disccovered that you really like to sing.. and want to improve..d|`|nNAAClOqaa	Why would your parents laugh? They love you! If you have a gift, you need to share it with the world. GOD gave us each a gift. If yours is singing then you have discovered it and GOD means for everyone to share the gift that he gave each and everyone of us. But if you like to sing then you should just go up to your parents and say, "Mom, Dad, I discovered that I really like to sing. I think I'm pretty good, but I don't think that I'm reaching my full potential. Maybe I could take some lessons?" and see what they say. If you want to, remind them that one day when you become famous, you will be earning alot of money :) haha good luck!|`|OCCzu7bFaa	Tell them that you're interested in learning to sing.  If they love you, they will support you in whatever you decide to do in life (as long as you don't decide to do something crazy like kill puppies or anything lol).<br>  I really doubt that they'll laugh at you.  If you convey this as being something important to you, then they will respect that.|`|vVp4iJZVaa	Tell them what you feel inside about taking singing lessons and try to be relax and calm while talking to them. Make it in just a few effective sentences and not more and show them that you respect their opinion and you would "really like" having their support because it means a lot to you. That should do it.|`|xOfIv67eaa	if you parents are normally the type to encourage you then u have nothing to be affraid of<br>  <br>  i play guitar and although my dad and brother make fun of me they are always supportive of it

It eventyaly evens out, and having this condition will affect your skin in the future, by whitining it much more.

I'm not sure if this one is out yet, but I've heard it's supposed to be totally in 3-D, with very similar theatre effects to what you've had in Shrek.

9CCtt077aa	I think it's your Leo Mars and Gemini rising. These two signs are flirts and also very romantic. Especially the leo mars. Mars has to do with how passionate you are. Also, the Gemini rising makes you quite flirty. :) Neither your moon nor Venus are in warm or romantic signs.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	If your romance is unique and random, then I would say that is very Aquarius like. <br>  <br>  Not to mention, you have a Mars in Leo.|`|KTtf0GLlaa	its just your personality ... horoscopes are based on a wide conception of people and let them make what is said fit into their lives and thats what your doing ... if your a good romantic person good on you dont let a horoscope plan your life =D|`|B7WIZdglaa	aquarians can be romantic. we just might not be as mushy as other signs. your virgo moon may help.
QJiWtzwNaa	i'm not quite sure what you mean...but i know a bit about the scorpio sign. my sister is a scorpio and she is the most secretive person i know! she is very quiet and independent, and very sneaky..and she's a teenager, if that helps. i also know that scorpios are sensitive, intuitive, and have deep feelings, but on the downside, they can be manipulative, suspicious, and be a bit controlling. also, scorpios and pisces tend to get along the best, from what ive heard/seen for myself. im a pisces, and once dated a scorpio, and we clicked very well.|`|HuXMiJLpaa	As far as your love life, that depends on your venus not your sun sign. My venus sign is capricorn and its hard for me to enter relationships, even during high school.

I dont' own those records and the only one I really listened to is 2pac... maybe some Nas here or there.. so ....   and I don't mean to put so much emphasis on the racism thing, I am just saying, music is your choice.   Britney Spears is terrible in my brain, but in the masses she has some sort of artistic quality, so I can't say that listening to her makes EVERYONE annoyed, unhappy, whatever...   so there is a taste issue here. I think that we should respect these artists that you mentioned because they weren't as commercialized and they didn't rap about just anything like most of the modern stuff coming out.    Funny thing: I was in a bar last night and a song probably called simply enough "ridin' spinners" about spinning hubcaps... come on... not about coming up through the ranks or the hardship rags to riches stories ... just talking about spinners... can't stand that kind of music.|`|vFj2GMP4aa	I don't own a Pac album so I guess I am not a "REAL" Hip Hop fan.|`|mBQQL0kCaa	no|`|dDDAbqqhaa	I think if someone doesn't like any of those guys then you can say that|`|Q8L7NWjwaa	Nuh huh!  But... if you ask a die hard Pac fan if someone is any less a REAL hip hop fan for not owning a Pac album~they might agree with that statement!|`|xxSGhywoaa	This isn't an answer to your question more of a point though:  I am not a fan of Rap/hip hop/r&b however, for some reason, I enjoy listening to 2pac.  I only own 1 album  I've never heard of Rakim but what about Biggie?|`|aKBqMLuhaa	Out of about 500 CD's I have probably about 25 rap/hip hop albums (and yes Nas is one of them) and I would not say that I am not a 'real' fan but just not a 'real big' fan; the albums I have I love just as much as any of the other genres I have. Does that make my love of them not real? Does someone who listens to DJ Logic on a regular basis have any weight over someone who listens to 2pac? I don't think so. Partly why I don't have more hip hop is due to exposure of it, not cause I don't like it.  So to answer your question.... No, that would be way to generalized to claim that someones hip hop choices make them more or less of a fan.|`|AA10687320	no, maybe they can't afford it or have no acess to internet to download.|`|ioNTTqKfaa	Not necessarily. They could still own other good albums. If however they only listen to bubblegum rap, then I wouldn't consider them a real fan.|`|86b28287757c82684fcf1bf59441d9aeaa	I don't think so.  Maybe they're not into them like that.|`|BO28Mn8haa	f* that its all about itunes|`|DPEm8HXLaa	I don't think so. I don't believe in things like that. I believe it has more to do with your love of something that makes you a fan. If you are in love with hip hop then you are a fan end of story :)|`|w5sK75MPaa	Yes & Id throw in A Tribe Called Quest|`|vRImZ32Maa	A fan doesn't necessarily mean they own their albums or anything. Just means they like the music and enjoy their releases.  I am a fan Punk Rock, but I don't buy their albums? I listen on YouTube or something like that.|`|reXfpsQgaa	This question can be perceived in a variety of ways. Like what if they owned their albums on the computer? or enjoys these artists but just doesn't have the money to buy their albums.|`|645da791a07e16987148c95ba7ac99f7aa	a star for you ....i got everything except those 3|`|rxIx8K1Yaa	I don't think so.

But damn most tru hip-hop fans do own at least one of those my nig. Idk man good question.|`|JHYwzWSbaa	they are very good artists i think, i own most of there albums    but on a case of being "real"      real is where you truely believe in something..if you believe in Jay-z..you'd support him by buying his album    you just gotta listen to what you really like..not what somebody else thinks!|`|DUGZa0Zgaa	Man, f@ck Tupac.

zVdNQowNaa	In my opinion it's between AZ and Big Pun    The way Big Pun just rhymed so naturally with such complexity, it took you five rhymes later for it to sink it what he actually just said because it was so incredible, great emcee and clearly one of the greats.    AZ had some of the greatest lyricism in the history of music, he is a true poet and emcee, he could replace some of the overrated figures in hip-hop on the outside world, if every rapper had lyrics like him hip-hop would rule the world (it already rules my world)|`|khU8m4gxaa	It's Pun, definitely. AZ would be 2nd, but he doesn't even rep being latino despite the fact that he's Dominican. He can't even speak spanish. I remember that from the Firm CD. I'm not a big fan of Fat Joe. He's OK. I didn't know Fab was latino. I'd put B-Real or 1 of the real old school MC's Charlie Chase from the Cold Crush Bros. up there, but Big Pun is 1 of the greatest ever regardless of race.|`|DDmFQU7raa	Big Pun, no doubt. That guy spit fire. Considering his weight, you didn't hear that fool grasp for air when he rapped! Another rapper I think is great would be Sun Doobie from Funkdoobiest.

NmLMUOkXaa	Pit bulls have a genetic predisposition for animal aggression, meaning they have been bred that way. Most have also been bred away from human aggression. While most pit bulls will be fine with adult humans, sometimes they do have trouble discerning between small children and animals. While I do believe that a dog's behavior is shaped by their master. Every dog has the ability to become aggressive in the right circumstances. Whether it be over food, territory, or even from a protective instinct. The problem arises when dogs are specifically bred as killing machines. The wrong breeding can lead to severe mental and physical problems in any animal. As an example, I bought a lavender corn snake because of it's beautiful coloring, but when I brought it home it was so aggressive I couldn't even feed it, no amount of loving care I gave seemed to help, out of fear for its health for not eating I returned it. I then read that lavenders are more aggressive due to the breeding it took to make them that color.   The point being that breeding any animal to have that much potential killing power (1600 pounds of force per square inch in a pit bull's bite) is dangerous. And while you may find a pit bull that was bred well, it's also just as likely to find one that hasn't been. I do believe that there are good pit bulls, but I'm personally not willing to take that chance.|`|JGjpc7Itaa	It's how they are trained (or not trained) that bothers me more.  I know some very nice ones but the thought of how some of them have been trained or abused scares me.|`|jjMvvJrmaa	They are ugly.|`|YjZJBDY2aa	My mom has one and it is quite hyper.

ZzqWzFNiaa	Hi Darth.  I know exactly what you mean, and even worse, I'm just getting sick of all the negativity in general. Maybe I've just been here too long and I've watched the cycle go around one too many times (I remember I used to find it kind of amusing), but I'm so sick of all these people who will taunt Jonas Brothers fans or post questions like "who could possibly suck as bad as..." Like I said before, I guess I've had my fun in that vain before too, and maybe I'm being slightly hypocritical, but it always in good fun before, now people are just out and out mean. I don't know, it's just tiring and to be frank, just really lame.     As to the all things modern suck conversation. It's just people who don't look in the right place, or at all whining. I mean, there are some amazing stuff from this decade and the 90s. It's just a cop-out really.    **************  Bashing Disney rock is the same as bashing anything else. Honestly in my opinion it's worse because most of the fans of those bands around here are kids. You're basically picking on kids when you put up a question like: "Anyone like the Jonas Brothers?" details: well you suck. or something akin to that. Or all that nonsense about "why do they even let people talk about the Jonas Brothers here" blah blah blah. Stop picking on kids. The only reason people find it acceptible is because they are an easy target, and of course it is. It's marketed towards kids. Can't we all just agree that it's not good and feel good knowing that there is a consensus opinion and we really don't need to discuss it anymore. I mean do people really need to run around and tell Disney fans how much they suck? Really? Is that how you get validation? Well, it sucks.    ***************  Thanks Sookie. I'm not sure why it's started bugging me so much, but too many people are just doing it the wrong way these days in my opinion.|`|vj2pOgT7aa	A TRUE music lover will keep an open mind and make his/her judgment based on the quality of each piece.

Modern music is put down so much because a lot of it is commercialized and uninspired. A lot of it is formula based. But every once and awhile a new artist comes along and smashes that formula and becomes popular. Then all the A&Rs go out and try to find other artists who sound like that and the process repeats.|`|71SjVwWNaa	funny b/c for someone like me who is interested in jam bands, the jam band community is thriving right now with excellent music and excellent bands...some of my favorite jam bands have only been around 8,9,10 years and some not even that long...    problem is people don't like to look, they want every thing handed to them, what bands they should like, what style they should wear|`|0vm66wlcaa	I feel the same way, man.    I used to think the same thing too, but then I got into Wolfmother, Bang Camaro, Valient Thorr, etc. I realized that today's music does not suck, but I have to say that a lot of it lacks musicianship. Most popular bands just play power chords the whole time. It annoys me.|`|1vCoaf08aa	Yeah, I see it a lot too, granted I do a bit of bashing, but it's mainly towards Disney.    Thanks to you though, I've got some Opeth on my Zune now. And I'm having second thoughts about newer metal music.    The 70s were better, but it's not keeping the new age of music from being any good what so ever.    MQ: Who keeps TD'ing you?    Edit: Could you star this?

But I admit that I no longer have the time to seek out new stuff. If someone drops a song or album on me I'll listen to it but in my own time. I do not have hours to spend listening to music and truely appreciating it unless I am in my car... alone. I do miss the days when I could focus on music morem, but it just doesn't happen now.  Besides many of the musicains and bands I love are still putting out new stuff so I tend to go with what i know I will like rather than buy something I'm not sure of. And most of the real "awesomeness" (as you put it) that I find now is when I go to shows and they have a fab opening band; and I say "holy crap, their good" and I pick up the CD on my way out the door. It takes a while for things to grow on me unless I see it live.|`|5HvdcWvBaa	Lol yeah i agree. I was on this morning (well, it was the morning in England!) and i saw some guy asking that exact thing...i was just like *siiiiiigh*    I used to answer them and recommend some modern bands and stuff (usually Velvet Revolver haha) but now i don't see the point. It seems like all their looking for is someone who answers with "OMG ! You're totally right!" etc. and it doesn't seem like they even wanna discover any awesome new modern music. So i am slightly doubtful as to whether they would even listen to any new music that they were shown, i think they would just dismiss it 'cause its modern. All they seem to want is someone to agree with them and confirm their point.     Well, thats my opinion on it anyways!    EDIT: Thanks Zach :) I'm glad you agree!|`|AA12301664	i hear ya.  i try to ignore most of them, but occasionally i storm in and give it both barrels.    i think what most people forget, or never even knew, was that the 'classics' they refer to now were not 'mainstream' in 1969.    as someone wiser and wittier than i once said:  i thought you were a fool, but then you opened your mouth and proved it    (your vid has been removed?)|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	I obviously disagree with modern music sucking since all of my favorite genres of music are modern. Even though I do really like classic rock but just not as much.     I don't even think there is more or less good music today then there was 30-40 years ago. I think it just depends on your taste and how willing you are to dig deep and find some good modern music. I mean, even if you don't like modern metal only people with no brain wouldn't admit its talented.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Ah, I used to be guilty of this too.    Eventually, I just gave in and took some bands being recommended on here and ran with it.  Nobody wants to give anything new a chance, and that would be fine with me, but I get so sick of seeing these questions too.  They aren't even asking anything, they just want you to agree with them lol.|`|ayS0085raa	I often find it's the opposite in the real world - top 40 kids dismissing all "old" music. Don't know which is worse ... both views are incredibly lazy, especially when you get someone who's just heard Katy Perry on the radio and automatically decides that that speaks for all modern music...|`|rR6lwxjjaa	thanks darth i agree, i like the old stuff and i can see why someone would say it if they didnt ever listen to anything but the radio but i mean comeon im 19 years old do these people really expect me to ONLY listen to music from the 60's and 70's? if people back then had been telling them to listen to music only from the 30's and 40's i think they'd have taken offense to it.    overall i think it just comes down to them not liking it, and instead of being able to accept that the bands have talent even if they dont play in a style the person likes they just bash and bash and bash it. that or they dont look past mainstream stuff|`|zZPbmxWkaa	It makes me sick. There's a ton of great modern music out there, people are just too lazy to look for it. All they know is the crap they hear on the radio.|`|76d0f42b082dd7b4403317013a48817eaa	I thought I was feeling the same way, but I think it was something I ate.         Seriously, you cannot make a blanket statement like "all  sucks" and not be looked at like you have a d!ck growing out of your forehead. Having said that ALL MODERN MUSIC DOES SUCK!!!!      Sorry, forgot to take my turrets medicine.|`|PRCfCSDxaa	Yeah, you're right. There's been quite a lot of bashing and even though I don't post it on here, I bash all of this new music to my friends lol. Of course there was brilliant stuff back twenty, thirty, forty years ago but there was also stuff that sucked, too. Today, it just seems to be worse and the problem with people like you or me and everyone else who loves old Rock N Roll are too disappointed with the way things have been going that most of us don't want to give today's music a chance. I can see where you are coming from though and I can see where someone with an opposing view is coming. It'll take some of us time to realize that.    I mean if you really look at it, would they put someone in the music business like Katy Perry twenty-five years ago? That's why a lot of people are having problems now, heck, even me. When I heard her song "You're So Gay" all I could think was "You've got to be kidding me??"|`|b32501726d33018adfee15dc84a32f79aa	I used to do the same thing, Darth, so I understand what you mean.  And while I would agree that *mainstream* Rock has taken a bit of a nosedive, I no longer generalize that all of modern Rock has.

It's their way of rebelling I suppose, Christianity is more "extreme" there than it is here, so it's more of a shocker, but some bands do take it too far.

KM8uZ4fVaa	Now? Hell, probably 800 million.|`|16b912e4bd4d6f66ed2959a22f1ac3caaa	Chances of him still being around would be pretty slim due to his love of pills and booze...but if some how he did survive I think he would not be worth alot. He was just a new voice in country from a local boy that could play a guitar. I know alot of people would disagree, but my personal love of country music has me even wondering if  any of his songs had any impact on me at all.     There are older performers that I can think of that would have been much wealthier had they lived longer. Like Hank Snow or Hank Locklin.    Hank Williams was raised in a small town called Georgiana in Alabama. The older people there who knew him when he was younger said he was a bully.And had no compassion for anyone.Why would someone like that have a lasting impact on the world?|`|Bj4Cq17Eaa	i think its hard to say what he would be worth. he was still very young when he died, and could have had a lot more to offer to the industry. he may have sobered up and had a long and lasting career, or he may have continued to drink and went down a different path. even if he was alive today and making music, i think he would be like all of the rest of our legends and ignored by the mainstream radio, and he wouldn't be treated the way i think our legends should be treated. george jones, waylon, johnny, nobody talks about them on the award shows or plays them on the radio, they were just pushed aside for the newest thing, its a shame. anyhow, i guess since he is no longer with us there is no way to know how much more hank would have gave to us, or how big his career would have continued to be. however, i strongly disagree w/ the person above who doesn't think he had any impact. many of todays singers as well as folks like george jones list hank as one of their idols. i've never heard of him being a bully, but whatever, i still love him & his music.|`|JiUwpYSXaa	With current country, he probably would be ignored.  "He's too Country" as Bill Anderson's song says.  And I don't why you can be too country.

LO3BMobRaa	If anybody should replace Lily, it should be Davetta Sherwood (second original Lily). She was much like Dru, so she should have stayed.|`|30r4coInaa	Maybe she's just playing Devon's girlfriend or a model at Restless Style.  I wish CK would leave, but they give Lily so much airtime that the idiots in charge must love her.    Also, the last winner of the open casting call just played two episodes as Adam and Heather's wedding planner.|`|YJlCKreSaa	I haven't heard anything about Lily leaving.  Usually when they recast a character they don't hold open auditions like that.  She probably won a small role or possibly something bigger, but I doubt its a recast.|`|FRE2gov3aa	This girl is cute but not as pretty as CK.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	I would really like for them to recast CK just so people will have someone else to pick on.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	very possible|`|qAoM2Jp5aa	She is really cute...I think that's what Lily would have looked like as she got older.  When she was little she had cute curly hair!!|`|Tc23KWgzaa	She'll be too tall for Billy!    TX Mom|`|eHyJ9mYFaa	I think Devon's girlfriend or someone to stir-up trouble between him and his girlfriend, like her sister.

Time passed, we walked down one hallway after another, and all the time, this weird feeling kept nagging at me.<br>  <br>  Suddenly, I stumbled and looked down to see what I had stumbled on and saw my mother's thigh-high stockings trailing three feet out in front of me! Aghast, I flew into the closest room to remove the retarded stockings while my boyfriend hooted, laughing like a hyena, and holding his sides until he collapsed in a heap on hallway floor.<br>  <br>  Then, I had to reappear with bare feet stuffed inside my shoes, as the nurses came running to see if my boyfriend was okay and had to explain the whole story all over again.<br>  <br>  It was sooo funny and soooo cold and sooo embarrassing!|`|PtfaM7jEaa	i was sitting in a restaurant and i could not get the ketchup out of the bottle so i was looking to see if there was any in there and i was squeezing the bottle and it squirted all over my face.<br>  <br>  my fiance was giggling and i heard giggling from the next table behind us.|`|SH2ysn6faa	well there was this one time where me my lil bro and my 2 cuzins went swimming in my apartment pool and it started to get dark and late so we were still swimming so ther were these boys swimming in the pool with us and one of them was sitting on the steps in the pool and i mistakened him for my lil bro so i was acting like i was drowning so i started reachin out to him and he was just starin and the closer i got the more he didnt look like my bro by the time i noticed it wasnt my lil bro i was really close to him and just stared at me i ws so embarrassed but just floated away like nothin happned and out my head under the water jeez just thinkin bout it makes me wmbarrassed|`|YqOYJXlVaa	I was like 3 and i was  taught i should always smile for pictures.

I was like... 11 years old, and I was at Disney World. I had to pee REALLY bad and I ran to the bathroom, but I pulled on each of the stalls instead of pushed... I ran outside the bathroom to get help from my friend but I ended up peeing my pants... I wore a sweater over my waist to hide it but it was so horrible I had to go back to the room.<br>  <br>  2. A few years back, I was on my first real and official date with a guy, 2 years older then me, and we were double dating at this mexican restaurant. Well, I had eaten red dye earlier that day (I'm allergic to it and it makes me throw up) on accident. So I take one bite of my food, and I say to my girl friend across the table "Hey, can we take a bathroom break real quick?" So we get to the bathroom, and she says "Oh it's a 1 person bathroom... Do you wanna go or should I?" mid sentence, I ran into the bathroom and threw up. I was shaking and freaking out, vomit on my sleeves, and I cleaned myself up best I could. Came back to the table (After quite some embarrassing time) and my date asks me if I'm alright, I say yeah but I'm not hungry anymore.. So he ate the rest of my dinner, and at the end of the night, he asked for a hug goodbye, and it was obvious that he wanted a goodbye kiss too... But since I smelled like vomit, I had to just make it a quick hug and leave. He and I dated for 2 months after that and it ended.<br>  <br>  3. It was raining and I was at a friend's house (BIG HOUSE) and we all were saying bye on the driveway. Well, my crush was there that night, and we had confessed to each other that we liked each other. Well, all that night we were playing tag... So once we got on the driveway to say bye, I did a dumb thing and tagged him then RAN like the wind. Well... I ran on the driveway, and the driveway was slick as ice since it was a really smooth cement and it was soaking wet. I fell HARD on my butt, in front of EVERYONE and their parents. My crush came over and helped me up and said it was a good fall. The next day he asked me out. That was last february, and he and I are still dating.<br>  <br>  Alright, top 3 most embarrassing moments, from the ok embarrassing to the extremely embarrassing.<br>  <br>  Hope this answer was good enough for ya. Sorry for the length!|`|vFXzYun2aa	It actually happened today... I was talking to this really cute guy who I've been in love with for a year now and I finally got up the courage to talk to him so I said "Can you believe the sun has finally come out?" and i made a large gesture to the sun with my hands and it turns out that I actually hit the face of the person who was walking next to me. The guy looked at me in a way like, "She's got problems". I was blushing like crazy.|`|1L3z0J41aa	LOTS but I'll tell u bout something... okay this guy i asked me out and I said no but my friends told him yes so he told all his friends he was going out with me but I wasn't then I told my friends I was going to tell him we were never going out and he looked sad for like the rest of the day.... anyway the embarrassing part is my school is little that means NO secrets and I had to sit by him in Science and Math and everyone was like ohhhh.....

M8qLP7MLaa	An episode is one episode of a series of a show. Basically it's all the stuff that happens in the shows between the opening and ending themes.    A volume on the other hand, is used to refer to the books in a series. Take manga (Japanese term for comic book) for example. One manga will usually have 5-10 chapters in it, depending on the series, but the book itself that these chapters are put into are called volumes. So if you had the first book of a manga series, then you would have volume 1. The second book in that series would be volume 2. The third, volume 3, and etc. :)|`|nMWtEmEFaa	An episode refers to one episode of an anime. A volume refers to a book containing several chapters (usually around 5 chapters) of a manga.|`|Klw3Ke3Haa	Episode is for shows. An episode is a part of a sequence of a body of work, akin to a chapter of a book.  Volume refers to comic related part of a book.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Episode is like a chapter to a manga. Volume is more like a completed DVD with episodes 1-5 as chapters.

AA11508090	Bulking up no matter what shape or size we are is very difficult. However, if your friend is determined and has at least 8 weeks he could add some good sized extra muscle if he works out three times weekly with weights, ensures he eats at least 150 grams of protein daily - easy to do with lots of chicken, tuna, and protein shakes. If he is really serious he could take a supplement of creatine. Creatine supplements work well in conjunction with serious weight training and should only be taken for a maximum of six weeks at a time. Make sure to work different muscle groups on different days so as not to strain the muscles, and also take at least one days rest in between each weight training session.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Just a thought, would you do better in Male health section?|`|Z9360MMxaa	Bulking up consists of putting a lot of protein into your body. Simply go to a health store and buy a big bottle of it, take a couple glasses of it a day and continue on eating hearty meals. There isn't really a way to do it without minimum effort unless you are genetically predisposed. No pain no gain. Tell him to dust off those weights and get at it.
AA12226501	They have to be re-written fairly often...older encyclopedias/dictionaries referred to "Computer" as a person who made calculations.  Job security, unfortunately, is not as good as you might think...in a down market, people are more concerned with essentials than having the most recent version of the encyclopedia.|`|9vOBtO1Oaa	I really could not tell you, because I don't know but I would think y they'd have to be revised every time new information was discovered or corrected. Get in touch with The Britannica directly. I believe they have the integrity it takes to offer you an answer!|`|QctSGbdAaa	ur an odd one|`|eIwj9a3yaa	I'm surprised they even still make encyclopedias, what, with the web and all|`|YW1DXceqaa	the same people that update Wikipedia?|`|G2WgHzu5aa	I have a set and it had nothing on Orgasms. I was disappointed.|`|dlqa6yFkaa	new editions come out every year.|`|X3ma2Qu4aa	I have an old set from 2003 that I can't even GIVE away.  I hate to burn books,,,,, but|`|AI4My948aa	Very good question.  And - where do their writers look up the information?|`|3h9zGIY3aa	I have an encyclopedia set from 1969, I wonder what strange and interesting things it has to offer....|`|qXMQDi5Haa	It depends on the publication house.  Encyclopodedia Britannica does so quarterly (more often than any other) but have hired less than qualified personelle to bring them up to snuff.  Relying on Wikkipedia sources they fall sady short of (& even less than) what the true "in-the-know" are aware of.  Lame at best.    To answer your Q ... those employed as researchers at EB don't have too much to worry about, provided they produce & stay atop of current info.  For those who choose to dream about loftier expectations, I'd say, give you're notice now & pursure those loftier expectations.|`|QnoysJJaaa	Funny.  I would imagine at today's fast pace, for the hardback printed ones, they are probably a little outdated before they even make it off the press...|`|iwONPromaa	Was Kathwah in the Encylopedia..heehee..I loved your last answer on my question..heehee..

Zz1HI5VHaa	Heck Yeah. I was discussing this with a friend the other day. I am sad my kids won't ge to go to school and play on the jungle gym, swing, teeter totter, or merry go round... All those sue happy parents. Darn litigious society.|`|mjb51CYWaa	When I was little, we had a playground made entirely of tires. From tiny spares to giant monster truck tires. It was great, it was such an adventure trying to climb the thing without slipping through the cracks or burning your hands in the sun. Its been almost 20 years and they've torn that thing down cause kids these days are so sensitive. They have to call the paramedics every time a kid gets a scraped knee nowadays.|`|28498a903efb7372e241c2b455610196aa	Yes it was, I remember monkey bars that where way out of reach of any adult, so if you fell you were going to break something, and the thread bared swinging tires heck yeah|`|a8qFkmSzaa	no.    yeah at my old school they have this stupid toy thing and kids are breaking their arms left and right. ugh|`|00b0f9ddac86ff60efd1e128d1e3d175aa	i havent seen the new playgrounds but i miss goin to the playground|`|CZ1nO9C9aa	Yes it was more fun when it was more dangerous.  And I don't ever remember anybody getting seriously hurt.  Who cares if you break your arm.  It's not really a big deal.  Nobody ever dies on playgrounds or becomes paralyzed.      It teaches kids athletic ability, quick thinking, balance, agility, .....|`|raUjKchLaa	Don't worry about my kids...they don't play on them they walk along the tops of the roofs and rails.  Way more dangerous than what we had to play with.|`|9ooXBxbJaa	hell yeah!!!  picking out the little pebbles from my knees and elbows,  getting infections from thistles in my fingers and still climbing up rusty poles, was part of being a kid. now in my adulthood im VERY carefull when biking through red lights.............................|`|AA12383908	Yes a good old fashioned PARK back in the day was the best.|`|oHo2VGGgaa	Totally. We used to set it on fire. Now that was fun
tjg7hLbMaa	CTV has it but I think you may run into the same issue (since it's a Canadian Broadcasting website).<br>  <br>  Alternatively, it is available on <a href="http://www.surfthechannel.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.surfthechannel.com/</a><br>  <br>  Edit: It was awesome by the way!|`|XZTf8Eahaa	Hello here you go <a href="http://www.tv.blinkx.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tv.blinkx.com</a> put what your looking for<br>  in the search bar in the site.|`|VC2zDWJ8aa	I would definately recommend surfthechannel.com.

The people in P&S are dirty and hurt my virgin ears.|`|CDnmuX1Jaa	Maybe because people want to know what  the Hip Hop people think      I wouldnt feel right asking a question about the show "Good Times" in the P&S section    Last time i did that, i got one real  answer, and other people said  " What's Good Times?|`|T3X7Aci4aa	The people in Polls & Surveys are retards.|`|vFj2GMP4aa	LOL @ Mechanical.

It would be a Cold "Hot Pocket" since "Hot" is part of the name, and not an actual description of the food in question.|`|jidsTmb1aa	sounds like a nasty pocket|`|y4yKmqQLaa	put it back in the microwave|`|8gXCjxl9aa	lol i guess you are right its just a pocket now.|`|008512e32e60fcef19c7029ae0dc4d45aa	No it would still be a "hot pocket" its the name brand

I watched about 3 or 4 minutes of it and what a waste of airtime.|`|fCgfReMiaa	i know but i still watch it.|`|1DT7OUuHaa	Actually, I think Bruce Jenner's "Bromance" is the worst.  Have you seen it?  OMG!  It makes me want to puke it's so awful!  They obviously got the idea from Paris Hilton's show (which was pretty bad I agree).  Some other TERRIBLE REALITY SHOWS include:  Double Shot at Love (incest at its best w/twin sisters making out with the same people and falling in love with the same people)  Tool Academy (enough said)  Rock of Love (the most recent is all about girls that ALL have really fake boobs doing very slutty things and getting into cat fights over stupid stuff and Brett and his stupid hair and stupid ego, sorry Brett!)  what else can we add here?|`|0XbyDBQLaa	I didn't like it.

Bromance is just as dumb!|`|CwkK8vDJaa	I saw like 30 seconds of it and it looked like absolute shyte, why would anyone want to watch a programme about paris trying to find friends? Lame
GNkVbUooaa	I am not sure what happened to that exact site, but i do know there are tons of sites out there that you can watch movies and tv shows on for Free..    My favorite is definitely OVGuide.com, they have like 3000+ sites in their directory and search engine. To watch a movie all you have to do is go to  http://www.ovguide.com search for the title of the movie or tv show and then OVG returns a list of search results telling you all the places that you can watch it for Free. Take you pick, and then OVGuide links you directly to the video..     It is really easy and works for every movie or tv show i have ever tried..i hope you like it!|`|1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	My friend's favorite drug was cocaine. But now he's in jail, so his cocaine is gone now too.    It's what happens when things are against law. You know, like stealing?    Watching movies that are still in theaters and not paying to watch them. It's called being an ACCESSORY to piracy. It's against the law.    No wonder America is an economic drought. All Americans want everything for FREE nowadays.    EDIT: Why don't you SHUT UP? If yahoo required me to pay to answer questions, then i would either pay up or not be on here. THIS is why all of our parents are looking for jobs, or worried about losing the ones the got now. Because everyone wants everything FOR FREE NOWADAYS!!!! Why do you think america's economy is in the crapper? You better start paying attention to the nightly news little girl. For the sake of your future, and the sake of your childrens future!

otcjMagiaa	Pixies - Hey
sHUnctqIaa	I have the same problem, and was bummed when my fave T.V show Chuck did a 3D episode, which I couldn't see. I watched it anyway, I even tried the glasses for a bit but of course couldn't see anything so I took them off. I was pleasantly surprised however that even without the glasses the episode was great! They used varied filming techniques so that even though I wasn't watching it in 3D it still looked different, although I couldn't describe how....    If anything trying to watch it on the small screen was harder than trying to watch a 3D movies on the big screen. Skip the glasses but remember that the producers aren't expecting everyone to watch it in 3D so you won't be missing out on too many things.|`|FUKyjY0baa	Yes they can be if you don't mind seeing ride and blue on the outlines of people or the things. Or trying seeing them on the small screens or just move up a row.|`|qMmo3k2Daa	bcuz u said glasses thats probably why

While Final Fantasy Unlimited is not connected to the rest of the anime based on that name.    It's like how Gundam Seed is not a part of the original Mobile Suit Gundam or Gundam Wing.     They are related in name only. Although every Final Fantasy seems to have some one named Cid.

I want Nick and Sharon to see Phyllis, l want Nick to be riddled with guilt and l want Sharon to get on her high horse and tell Phyllis sh!t like: Karma is a bltch and how does it feel now that the shoe is on the other foot etc....you know, all the "I'm GC's  1 Saint" crap and THEN, l want Phyllis to get ghetto fabulous on her @ss like Sheila on crack up in that cabin and THEN go back home, make sure Summer is safe somewhere and behave like a bull in a china shop and set the tack house AND Sharon's house (where she was locking lips with Victor) on fire! Go collect Summer and wait!|`|Tc23KWgzaa	No.  She's very likely to start acting like a psycho, tho.    TX Mom|`|qAoM2Jp5aa	No, not really...she deserves it!!

I don't know why people keep forgetting that Sharon has been after almost every man in GC, even Victor, come on.  She is like a young Brooke from the B&B.|`|AA11111233	Yes, and have Sharon be in the cabin when she does.  One less self-righteous, hypocritical, stanky ho ***** to put up with.  Maybe that will help Nick get the message and pay more attention to Phyllis, but at this stage of the game, I want Nick to be crawling on his damn belly and give an apology that bests the one our Prime Minister Stephen Harper gave to the Aboriginals last summer, concerning those reform schools    SHARON COLLINS NEWMAN ABBOTT MUST PERISH!!!!!!|`|uwds1QuVaa	No, I used to like Nick and Phyllis, but she has been acting way too jealous and paranoid lately!  It is time for Sharon and Nick to find their way back to each other.|`|lv1dT7BQaa	No i dont wish that But that would be something she might think about,Now she knows how Sharon feels,being cheated on.Look I hate Phyllis and always have so she gets what she deserves.|`|YJlCKreSaa	LOL...that would be just like Phyllis!  But then Nick would rescue Sharon and immediately divorce Phyllis. There may still be hope for Nick and Phyllis, even though I would rather see Nick and Sharon hook up.|`|HXg8Vagpaa	LOL, very well planned Jaz!! I love it. I honestly like Phyllis. You guys seem to forget that it takes two to tango and F*ck in this case. I understand that Sharon still has deep feelings for the guy but come on, if he did it once more than likely he will do it again and the same thing goes for her. She doesn't exactly have the "golden" track record either.|`|4kuWOZowaa	RIGHT ON SCOTT I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU!!!!!! OMG I JUST WISH SHARON NEWMAN WOULD DIEEEE....I HATE NICK AND SHARON WITH A PASSION!!!!!!OMG AND ITS CRAZY HOW HE JUST RAN DOWN THERE I HAVE TO GET TO SHARON A SET UP FOR A REUION...THIS IS ONE REUION I ABOSUTLEY HATE!!!!    SHARON NEWMAN MUST DIE|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	YES,,,I'm sick of Nicholas NOT setting boundaries with Sharon. She needs to grow up and keep a man.|`|IsxB0Qi7aa	Yes, I wish Phyllis found a way up there & get some sort of revenge... all that bull**** Nick kept feeding Phyllis, all this time she was right, she had every reason to be jealous & worry.     I just got home & I am watching it on my DVR right now & I am sooo disappointed, I am in shock, I mean now what??? All these different scenario's keep playing around in my head, but basically it doesn't matter what happens at this point, Nick screwed up & things will never be the same...

Pierrot the clown-Placebo  Serenity-Armin Van Buuren****The vid for this is cool (live) I got really emotional with this song while looking at the starlight sky and the crescent moon peeking over the smoky rooftops.  Binary Finary 1999-Kay Cee****watch the music vid, it's touching  Don't Cry out-Shiny Toy Guns  Make Love-Daft Punk  adagio for strings-Dj tiesto****The music vid is empowering (live)  Blonde Redhead-Messenger    The two trance songs are really good...probably the best to listen to when you're down. The other ones are really good too. I don't really listen to the words as much as I feel the tone and mood of the song. To me, that's what is most important. In times like these, you write your own story. Don't let bands tell you how you're feeling or how you should feel.    Ok, now reading your edited post, pierrot the clown and messenger are probably the best for a slideshow.|`|NoEInGweaa	you could try "alone" by judas priest.|`|ZYkjfxniaa	Traditionally when feeling down people listened to the Blues.|`|5d6392a517918c69f898af7a86fa7bfaaa	Ozzy Osbourne- "Close My Eyes Forever"  Red Hot Chili Peppers "Under the Bridge"  ....Sorry I'm really not an indie expert...i play pop-punk and listen to pop-punk,  popular alternative and experimental.

So he's not exactly a poser calling it a "rock" album|`|F7YU3FFraa	I think he needs to stay in his own territory. <br>  <br>  Leave the rock to people who can handle it, people like:<br>  <br>  Ozzy Osbourne<br>  <br>  Guns N' Roses<br>  <br>  Kiss<br>  <br>  Etc.|`|VtHZjeVkaa	he's a confused individual and he sold 1 million copies because he brainwashed his fans making them think hes good|`|btIDOI04aa	He is not doing rock unless he is playing the guitar.

4bFypdGLaa	Because they have nothing better to do and they feel better about themselves being losers when they bash other people. And because they can bash anim fans without giving any reason or having ever watched anime so they can get away with it...   and after they bash something that can't defend itself then they feel like they've won an argument and start doing it for fun and start using ridiculous untrue logic; that all aime is Hentai, that it's only for kids (and yes they will use these two together o.O) or That every one who watches anime is a weeboo or EMO.    And then the Animetards (fan-girls and boys) get mad and only add fule to the fire and start bashing American animation and non anime viewers and even other anime viewers. So people that had no real opinion started disliking Anime 'cauz they figured the whole fan base was retarded. So even more anime hater are created and every one starts poking fun at otakus.    And now there is no reason for the constant bashing, it has turned in to a never ending cycle ...  and all because of a few insecure assholes on the internet : (   *Sad*    But I'm still proud to be an Otaku, because I know it's not all Hentai and the anime I watch certainly isn't for kids and I just so happen to be a kewl enough person in real life to not have the need to go around bashing american animation and starting pointless fan-girl and -boy arguements online and bother people that don't care about anime. =_=|`|3N2ElzcQaa	People assume that anime fans are stupid.    People assume that anime fans who watch anime for hours having nothing on their minds except anime.    They think anime fans fail school.    They think that anime fans have no life whatsoever.    People just assume that all anime fans are like that, but they don't know them. They shouldn't assume anime fans are like that at all.     People also think that anime fans just don't like to go outside or whatever.    This is not true of course.    Not all anime fans are the stereotypical otaku or nerd-like people. Its always taken the wrong way.    I have experienced this on this site a lot.    But, if you live in my area, there's no insult to any kind of people. Anime fans can live their lives where I live. I really mean it. No one underestimate or overestimate a very shy and quiet person because people are smart enough to not mess with them.     =)|`|SDvs99Ccaa	Maybe because they think that all animation is for kids.Or they saw the bad dubbing on cartoon network,which makes the anime seem childish.  People just like to be mean.It's a fact of life.And yup, im an anime fan.|`|JlEucUVtaa	Because it is one of nerdiest things I can think of at the moment.|`|MhjZMgzTaa	I can't give you ten reasons, but here are a few. and yeah I'm a fan of anime, but not a hardcore fan.     Most anime fans tend to be entirely too caught up in their favorite series.    I've witnessed dbz fanboys, and fanboys of other animes argue over power levels and ridiculous things like that.    Since most fans tend to get so wrapped up in it(dressing up like their favorite characters, coming up with their own anime names, etc.) most people see them as nerdy, and or as a loser.|`|uNIHqmH8aa	I only need to give one.    They're immature idiots who don't actually look at something and see the real meaning of it before judging it. In short, they're shallow.    -Nov|`|6Gbw0wETaa	i think its because they think that aime fans are childish and nerdy because to others anime is just a cartoon and they think that being an anime fans is as bad as having OCD about bob the builder or dora the explorer or stuff like that.....basically they steriotype anime as simple cartoon that kids watch!     ps... this is my mums account but i cant be bothered to log out, log on and find this question again so im using hers.....my name on yahoo is bunny13vicky (im 15 though)|`|ItSpFZ4Waa	I will let you know before my answer that I do like anime and manga.    1.  They have never seen a good anime  2.  The people they have met who like anime seemed weird to them  3.  They think that if you like anime then you are automatically obsessed with it  4.  They watched a bad anime  5.  They haven't watched any of Hoyao Miyazaki's films  6.  They can't accept people who are different then themselves  7.  They aren't cool    That is all I can think of.

4pJ9DYLvaa	Most of Bones is filmed in Los Angeles, California, despite the fact that the show is mainly set in Washington, D.C., where the fictional Jeffersonian Institution is located. The interiors of the Jeffersonian Institution were specially built on a large soundstage at the 20th Century Fox lot in Century City, Los Angeles, California.[12] The 4th season premiere (a special two part episode) was filmed on location in London, England.|`|r4kMzNZVaa	I'm pretty sure it's filmed in California. <br>  <br>  I love Bones!!!|`|i9BjHDHOaa	LA i think =]|`|2kpr2arRaa	they have location info at Imdb.com<br>  just put the show title in there search--<br>   and look down the page of info to "locations"<br>  <br>  it is all filmed in LA at 20th Century Fox studios
rXgF0Pmaaa	Apparently Radio 1 refused to play Creep by Radiohead much because there were too many accounts of people committing suicide to the song.    I don't know how true that is though...|`|PvPPivLJaa	I've searched and found answers to this that were given in similar question.  So, this is not my brain at work here.      Asleep by The Smiths    "99" By Marilyn Manson on the Antichrist Superstar album has been rumoured to cause people to attempt/commit suicide. Here is the hook:    "Prick your finger it is time, the moon has now eclipsed the sun, the angel has spread its wings, the time has come for better things"    I have never heard of anyone committing suicide from "Jumper" by Third Eye Blind. This song is about stopping a friend from committing suicide with a very positive message.    "Adam's Song" by Blink 182 is depressing. This one can even get me going and it takes a lot to affect my emotions through music other than simple happiness from hearing a good song.    The most famous one is Suicide Solution by Ozzy Osbourne. He actually got sued from a teenager's parents because they blamed him because he kept playing the song over and over and finally killed himself. When his parents found him it was still playing. How Can I Laugh Tomorrow If I Can't Even Smile Today? by Suicidal Tendencies needs an honorable mention. Fade To Black by Metallica.|`|OTFzJbaMaa	people blamed marylin manson for colembine.|`|Zxl8oyIraa	That's a bit of an idiotic thought, but while we're on the subject Judas Priest got sued a while back for "Subliminal Messages Leading to Two Teens Suicide" I personally don't believe it or remember the song, but that should help|`|Lngb8ryFaa	the only instances i could think of when music supposedly caused suicide was the aforementione djudas priest example and "Suicide Solution" by ozzy...both of these charges were dropped as it was determined that the suicidees were just idiots..really, who would freakin kill themselves 'cause of a song??|`|tJpP8VRyaa	Lol, well there's Kill Yourself by Mindless Self Indulgence, but that's sort of making fun of the whole "My [Insert title here] killed himself cause of this one thing!" mentality.    But a lot of Nirvana songs supposedly have references to suicide as well.|`|4qakEiXeaa	RUBBISH! A song does not lead any normal, stable, sane person to commit suicide, violent crimes, etc...A song might make you think deeper about something, consider a new idea, influence an opinion or even change your mood, but from there to ending your own life or someone else's is quite a stretch. At best, a song could reinforce suicidal ideations that are already present in a depressed, desperate or mentally ill person.  Psychiatric illness, substance abuse, unrequited love and the inability to cope with loss, grief or stress are the main causes for suicide, not Metal or Emo or Radiohead.     The only music that has made me think seriously about ending my life is Nickleback, Fergie and Country Music in general, but that had more to do with the quality of their music than my desire to live.|`|NoEInGweaa	try looking up ant articles you can on a trial that happened when judas priest got sued for subliminal messages in their song "better by you better than me"

WyxxDgSeaa	Most actors start kind of low as far as skill in concerned and improve with each role. Jolie, for me, has gone the other direction. She started out with a bang with Gia and Girl, Interrupted.  Then, once she became THAT Angelina Jolie and started collecting baggage and an enormous ego, her acting skills suffered. I think she believes she is the "anointed one" as an actress, mother earth, femme fatale, and world saver!  For me, it effects her ability to make me believe her in a role and I've lost interest in her.|`|eNR2iot8aa	I don't think she's that bad of an actress, some of her films are better than others, but if you watch some of her movies like Girl Interrupted you can see she has acting talent.|`|kHY0eMVraa	I think shes a great actress.<br>  Most of the movies she acts in are good.|`|2jMFurDoaa	shes not at all<br>  <br>  shes "sexy and hot". thats what everyone says so it blows her ego up, she has this im-better-than-everyone attitude. <br>  <br>  and when hollywood says somethings the rest of the world has to believe it because we cant think for ourselves...<br>  <br>  i dont think shes any better looking than me and my friends are, in fact her mouth kinda scares me lol<br>  <br>  and she cannot act!|`|V9pAr6Ysaa	in some movies, yes, in most, no. idk why people make such a big deal about her|`|jgpYS0oEaa	Yes she can act.|`|a860e9b17c0946e66c4ca331bb01f9d2aa	Yeah, I agree. I watched Changeling and I didn't see what all the hype was about. Something about her is very distracting; you just don't believe she is her character, which is crucial for actors.<br>  <br>  I think people just say she's a good actress because they think she's pretty and because she has 10,000 creepy animals, er, children.<br>  <br>  *I agree with *Alana*; she was great in Girl, Interrupted.|`|mGvpcZrFaa	She's a terrific actress but right now she's not making good movie choices.|`|weeW4gk4aa	Check out a movie called Beyond Borders and see if you feel the same.|`|DjbpmSgWaa	I don't like her.

8VmGls31aa	It's a kid robbing a candy store in the Lupe Fiasco song.  The boy bought a gun with his allowance money, so he went to the candy shop and stole the money and cookies from the store.  <br>  <br>  The song just compares the violence in different cultures, and the different reasons kids use guns to perpetrate violence.  Some for self defense, some because they're at war, some because they have done nothing but kill people their whole life.  Kids are on the wrong path.|`|sTwTXixXaa	In Lupe Fiasco's song, little Terry was robbing a candy store.  It might have a deeper meaning than that, but I don't know.

(screenshots/info for these are found on the same site)    Maria-sama ga Miteru is well known but frankly I wasn't a huge fan - fairly boring. Candy Boy is a recent one that's supposedly decent.

jZwK9WlLaa	With celebs time is their problem and they get hundreds of letters asking for autographs and then they have to get decent pictures of them selves sorted to send, where as if you send a picture of them     (6" by 4" is the best size to send) and then they can just sign it. Also include an envelope addressed to your house in the letter with a stamp on so they can quickly sign it put it in the already addressed envelope and send it back. that way it is quicker and easier for them and you are more likely to get a reply. Good Luck! :)|`|8ku6ox0Taa	i would include a photo. To get a athletes autograph you have to send a picture so it may be the same way.|`|0OSeBeLaaa	if you want it so badly- send a pic but you can just send a letter asking them to sign the photograph and then send it back to you.  but it honestly varies between celebs!|`|Hhu50gPlaa	it really depends from celebrity to celebrity.  some even like it when you send them extra postage to return it  to you!    i've sent both letters with and without pictures and have gotten very nice results with both. they know that they're celebs, and know that they're gonna get fan mail. if you're able to get your hands on their fanmail address, then i'd say try it both ways and see how it works out!    keep in mind it may take a few months to get a response because most famous celebs are very busy, and some may not reply at all! don't be discouraged though. there are many more people that would be delighted to answer your fan mail!    hope that helped =)  gabbbaaayyy.

e0M223VRaa	Thats the type of music i like so you should like...    The Script - we cry or The man who can't be moved    Craig David - insomnia    maybe ... Shwayzee    Air traffic - Shooting star    Kevin Rudolf - let it rock    Jason Mraz - Im yours    James Morrison - Broken strings    Lily Allen - The Fear  and a new band i heard Absent Elk!    That type of thing i like the script the most!!!|`|Mfy5gd77aa	try beck, the chemical brothers, moby, the eels, the turtles or just go on deezer, play a song you know you like then start smart radio.|`|iaHM24Xjaa	here are some;  - Alesha Dixon Album Version - Breath Slow  - Alesha Dixon - Boy Does Nothing  - Prodgidy - Omen  - Kelly Clarkson - Life would suck without you  - James Morrison - Broken Strings  - Franz ferdinand - Ullyses    Hope these give you some ideas!|`|QnAEEmB3aa	You should check out the Soundtrack for "The Longest Yard" the remake from 2005. It has the likes of Nelly, Murphy Lee and D12. It's mainly rap but there's a few slow, more meaningful songs.    I absolutely love "1970 Somethin'" and "It Has Been Said" by the Notorius B.I.G at the moment  and Gym Class Heroes are the SHIZZZ!    Hope this helps! :)

q4XUy0Duaa	Definitely BUY!    Here are few examples of questions that make me want to shoot myself in the head...    1.  What's this song?????? I don't know any lyrics and I can't describe the beat but I heard it on 107.3 in Wyoming three months ago.    2.  OMG, I hate rap, but I just saw Notorious!!!  Do you think Biggie was misunderstood?    3.  Rate my verse...    4.  Is Hip Hop dead?    5.  Is (insert rapper name) married?    6.  Why won't you admit Lil Wayne is the greatest of all time when he said it himself.....?    7.  Can you name all of the good rap songs?    I can go on and on, but you see where I'm going with this.....|`|wfZhkZO0aa	It doesn't bother me.

Like the other day, there was a "Are there any good Gucci Mane songs?" question.  Now, instead of saying, "THERE ARE NO GOOD GUCCI MANE SONGS LISTEN TO NAS", I just kept on movin'...    I also don't like that people don't search for questions before they ask.

0NcRUSCoaa	I love U2, I have followed them for years.  I have not heard their new single, but I have heard it is weak.  I ordered "No Line on the Horizon" today, as I don't think they will ever disappoint me. I agree with you, "How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb" was a monster of an album, as are "The Joshua Tree" and "Achtung Baby". Hopefully, the new single won't be a reflection on the rest of the album...but you know it will sell incredibly well regardless.|`|pRz0Umhraa	I thought it was pretty good(not great) my first listen...definitely something different. There are so many layers and aspects to try to wrap your head around. I believe that I like it. Then again, my favorite album is 'Achtung Baby'. Comparing this to the first time I heard "Vertigo", "Boots" got me waaaay more pumped up. I think it's going to be awesome live. However, I don't think that many people who aren't already fans will like it. It doesn't seem to have a super catchy chorus or anything. Who knows, I could be wrong. I personally don't think the first single is always the best. One of my least favorite songs is "Vertigo", but that's just my opinion. Still can't wait for "No Line on the Horizon" on March 3rd!!!|`|KWF9dphHaa	I like the new single but you're right it's not great. I'm not worried though, because the band have always had a strange choice of opening single, remember none of the following were an opening release: Sunday Bloody Sunday, One, Angel of Harlem, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.   Also the tracks Breathe and Moment of Surrender from the new album have recieved many positive reviews.
f2c03d5c2b6c415dede17268613279ecaa	It gets a bit confusing.  Henry VIII (1509 to 1547) established the Church of England and confiscated the property of the Catholic church, because the catholic church would not recognise his divorce.  He was succeeded by his 10 year old son Edward VI for 5 years, then his daughter Mary (1553 to 58) who was either catholic or sympathetic to them, and who married the Catholic King Philip of Spain. She in turn was succeeded by Elizabeth (1558 to 1603) who was staunchly protestant or Church of England.    The conflict was between catholic and protestant english people, as well as on diplomatic level between england and spain.|`|g8BEEIW8aa	I believe that would be that the queen was Catholic but the main population was Protestant so there was a rather large conflict in religion in a time when religion was a large factor

0HGqGJYTaa	For sex, it's basically mars, but you also pay attention to your sun and venus collectively    For you to assert such, you don't know anything about the sun sign aquarius because that is purely an experimental sign in bed, as with any of the air signs.    Air signs are not known for passion or intensity, but experimentation, yes, and especially aqua followed by Gemini!!! With Libra you get less experimental, but more passion.    The air signs can be quite kinky.    You seem pretty sexual to me....    Capricorns have high stamina and you have it in mars which a good thing. The funny thing about the influence of cap is either you can be highly conservative or highly sadistic.|`|ykIleAQ7aa	Okay well you say you have a Cancer rising and Sagittarius Moon. Well let me tell you Cancer's have a very high sex drive. (I should know I am one!) I think people underestimate Sagittarius when it comes to sex they are very sexual people as well. Aquarius by nature can be very spontaneous as well as Sagittarius.|`|B7WIZdglaa	mars in scorpio usually indicates great sexual activity.. but that doesnt mean just because your mars isn't in scorpio that your not sexual.

3nRfePaaaa	because he doesn't promote his work properly.<br>  and he doesn't have or do extravagant features or cameos.<br>  Kweli is my 2nd fav. rapper, but idk sometimes it seems like he wants to hide from the public and other times he really wants to be heard.<br>  His skill is unquestionable, but I feel like only a few people really understand him.<br>  A lot say they don't listen to him because his albums lack production (good beats).<br>  I agree, but just listening to his lyrics makes up for it.<br>  I can't think of another rapper that makes me reflect on so many different things like Kweli does.<br>  so yea he's underrated to a certain extent.|`|Niygpxktaa	Mostly because his fan-base/target audience is relatively small. <br>  People outside of that circle don't seem to believe he is as good as his audience  thinks he is.<br>  <br>  This is certainly not a knock on his talent, he just seems to lack "mass appeal."|`|os6FaEBlaa	He is heavily slept on. He is skilled on the mic', but not many people actually know him because he doesn't make mainstream friendly tracks.|`|BhQSTvLsaa	I know! I totally agree with you! Talib Kweli rocks my flipping socks off|`|bribxhsdaa	I think it's like asking why isn't Carlos Santana mentioned consistenly enough as one of the greatest guitarists of all time...<br>  <br>  He should be, Definitely has the skill and material to support the claim. But he just isn't for reasons unknown. Plus, If you're one of those "Stop talking all dat edumecation and backpackin ****" You won't hear a word he has to say. <br>  <br>  He's spat some of the greatest conscious verses of all time over his career..I also figure that as much as he had slight mainstream success with The Beautiful Struggle and Eardrum, He's still a hip hop purist's type of rapper..So if you're not specifically into his message and the subjects he covers, you'll de-value him as an MC.<br>  <br>  He's in my top 5 on that kinda subject matter definitely.|`|okECVBkzaa	I just listened to "Quality" today and had a similiar thought. Like one of his song intros goes, you need a new name like T Kweezy. Maybe his name and personality are too dull. <br>  <br>  I love this album by the way.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I appreciate it even more that he's so underrated.<br>  <br>  Edit: I dont think he should change his name to T Kweezy. That would be ridicilous, thats what media/dont knows, want.|`|KHC2oE8iaa	honestly? it has nothing to do with his content. but it's the same deal with any other under rated rapper; people like yourself don't support him like you should. seriously lets think about this for a minute. the same people that listen to kanye west and t.i. know who talib kweli is including yourself. and all else. and there's a million plus people just like you. <br>  <br>  also he needs to  try different sounds in his beats. yeah i'm pretty sure he has people producing his music but he still has a say so over what he wants. <br>  <br>  he has also put himself in a box. mainstream rappers play the field. they can rap about anything from, hard times to good times, party music to tragic music. my thing is, be versatile. and he as well as others lack that. switch up your style. until then you won't see rappers like him or lupe fiasco get anywhere. prove me wrong.|`|ReqWzUM0aa	Because he doesn't have any hit songs, so not many people even know about him.|`|UhtSE2B6aa	...because he is too socially conscious. The masses do not want to promote that type of intelligence.|`|41mwqPuPaa	I've heard people complaining about his voice. Maybe that's why they don't like him.|`|IlNDHC3raa	cuz his voice is annoying to some people.|`|OpBFc27iaa	i agree 100%.<br>  <br>  im actually not sure why he doesnt..hes in my favorites, boy is good.|`|l72FO4eMaa	Hey New Moon, your new display pic is hot!<br>  <br>  But to answer your question, I don't think he knows who he is, to explain myself, I feel that he firstly that his flow is weak because he uses "battle rapper" style flows and tries to spit in a conscious mode. Example, on the Black Star album he was almost out shined on every track because he wasn't able to ride the beats properly. I think he needs to work more on his delivery and then come back.<br>  <br>  But I wouldn't say he is underrated, because that just depends on what audience you are talking about. If you're talking people who listen to more lyrical content then no, it is very unlikely that he will not be spoken about, but if you're talking about 14 years old + kids watch BET he will have the same reception as if Rakim or someone came out....total silence, because his style of music is not the "in" thing on the commercial hip hop scene.|`|jhMkBqk7aa	Talib Kweli is way underrated because mainstream America is retarded.  They don't want to think, they just want to hear stupid hooks that repeat over and over.  Talib Kweli is not just an MC he is a political philosopher coming up with the most introspective things in hip hop I have ever heard like "Maybe its the mind state thats ill, creating the crime rates to fill the new prisons they build."  That kind of stuff makes you think instead of telling people how gangsta they are to repetitive Scott Storch lyrics.  The populations taste in hip-hop as well as their willingness to believe Republican propaganda are two of the most frustrating things I can think of.|`|t74KHpcsaa	Hi New Moon, I love the new pic too. Very nice.<br>  <br>  I think the reason why Talib is not mentioned much is because he, unlike so many others, has refused to sell out. I think overtime, he'll be hailed as this generation's KRS-One. Because truthfully, he is.|`|xxgx0IVAaa	Talib Kweli is underratted in mainstream rap because most consumers like garbage music. Hes one of the best out there right now. Most people know that the people that don't agree need to turn of the radio once in a while.|`|21ewjYXKaa	i agree, he is a force to be reckoned with on the mic.  it is because he is not flashy and materialistic.  all the kids and people who dont go in debt into hiphop over look him.|`|sTwTXixXaa	Because people sleep on him.  He isn't the only great emcee who is slept on though.  He probably would get mentioned if he created party songs and maybe another "crank dat" dance.|`|sLWvkqsVaa	Because his lyrics is over alot of peoples heads. Radio wont play him cuz then the ppl listening will find out what real rap is.|`|EtSPbSzcaa	Him and jean grae are the hottest thing in hip-hop<br>  <br>  Its cause he dosn't use the hot beats or dumb it down or a cameos with fake artists like lil wayne|`|pLBHN0OKaa	Cuz radio play likes nice beats and big hooks not real lyrics like talib and mos def|`|AYkEwqRXaa	Jay-Z said something in one of his songs that if rhyming wasn't about the money he would be Talib Kweli.  That's a loose quote and you probably know where I got that from.  I think that goes a long way in answering your question.|`|nQReQLFkaa	talib is an ill lyricist he was in blackstar just has incredible talent and that is recognized by the greats commercial rap these days suck

They're all so similar.<br>  <br>  The Joker and Batman - well, the Joker stated their similarities<br>  The Joker and Harvey Dent are both in it for power and both become bad guys<br>  And the Batman and Harvey Dent are both heroes to the public, and both for only a short while.<br>  <br>  I'd do Batman/Dent, though, because I think their comparison is the most accurate to write about, and I guess they have differences, you just have to look a little.|`|EbInCDHEaa	joker/batman would be mostly contrast (you can tell by how batman just cannot understand anything about the Joker's character)<br>  joker/harvey would have comparison and contrast, but i would think it would be weak, and not the best choice.<br>  batman/harvey would have strong points to make in both comparison and contrasting, and i think this one is the way to go.

xxgx0IVAaa	He still thinks hes the same rapper that he was when he dropped Get  Rich or Die Trying. That was a classic album. Compare "How to Rob" to his new ****. Big difference. Honestly let him do his rap ****. If he wants to take you to the candy shop...go ahead but I cant stand fake rappers. He got shot 3 times. The reason there was multiple holes was because they where in and outs. Plus hes all about money. Hes raping the world of it. He could care less about G-unit and he made that clear. F*ck 50....plus Game killed his *** selling over a million units of his mixtapes. I would NEVER bang any of his new s*it. <br>  HE SINGS NOW ADAYS! <br>  <br>  P.S. Hes better that Wayne.|`|EtSPbSzcaa	All of his stuff sounds the same and his feuds are distracting you can't mess with jay and nas|`|21ewjYXKaa	i wouldnt say he is the worst of all time.  and i also wouldnt say he is one of the best. he is somewhere in the middle if you feel me.  but the thing about 50 is, alot of people may not like him but he has some things and credit that cant be taken away.  his album Get Rich or Die Trying did great and it was good, and like you said it is a classic.  Also his hit "in da club" is going to be remembered for years and considered one of the best songs of the decade and maybe one of the best hip hop songs of all time in the future.|`|6fxr3VBGaa	to me i think 50 cent just got worse and worse each album he put out. i mean when he came in the game he was like unstoppable. but it seemed like all of his albums progressively got worse. and then he started more into dissing people for no reason. and just doing a whole lot of dumb shyt. now i don't even know where or what he is doing.|`|mZOt8oURaa	He was garbage in the beginning of his career,he pays to get shot.Then he's hot now he's not.Garbage always have and will be.|`|kuxVB76maa	When the hell did being lyrical matter? 50 has hot beatz and a amazing flow. I'm just losin a little respect because he hasn't delivered any big hits since 05. In my opinion, The Dream and Soulja Boy are one of the worse in the music industry.|`|feXQcuKjaa	he doesnt focus on his music as much as he focuses on startin beef wit other rappers...y cant he be happy that another black man is doing good?....we should be proud that we got succesful and talented black men like lil wayne... all 50 cent does is try to downgrade people that just had a big load of success....he aint gonna stop weezy so he might as well just 4get about it!|`|EKM9AKc2aa	get off 50|`|sTwTXixXaa	I did like GRODT, but 50 cent just isn't lyrical.  It just seems pointless when he raps because he only gets worse.  I'm past the stage where a whole bunch of cuss words and talking about being "gangsta" in music has shock value.  I like to listen to more than a gimmick.<br>  <br>  @Anotha Sp!c<br>  50 has an amazing flow?  Where?  Give me an example.  Someone with a good flow IMO is Jay-Z.  Also all of his beats aren't that great either.<br>  <br>  He doesn't completely suck, he is just inconsistent and nowadays washed up.  GRODT was when he was in his prime.

He ruined it from the first song.|`|KHC2oE8iaa	i just went to see the video on youtube just so i didn't look as if i was talking out my a**. even though i've heard it before. i don't like it because it's pitchy as hell meaning he doesn't hit the right notes at any point in time of the song, its boring, the hook sucks, and the beat is mediocre. aside from that you got to hand it to them for creating the video. it's like a big a** commercial for the iphone. and the plays on youtube??? over 5 million. so yeah he's doing something right. but scale of 1-10 with ten the highest i give the song a 1.|`|NSn0zFfMaa	i luv that song but i hate how he disgraces women!!!!|`|pLBHN0OKaa	All Souja boy sucks|`|6ddNezzSaa	yeah its ok...|`|KbUPtDSkaa	yes|`|hA5m65Waaa	its not bad|`|sLWvkqsVaa	R U F#cking kidding me?

OCdUI3wzaa	Are you talking about the picture in the new york post. <br>  Cartoonist Sean Delonas published the picture depicting two police officers shooting a chimpanzee. According to Think Progress, the incident was inspired by a pet chimp attacking a woman in Connecticut.<br>  <br>  But Delonas' caption reads, "They'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill.", tying the chimp to Obama's recent signing of the Economic Recovery Bill.<br>  <br>  According to Rev. Al Sharpton, the New York Post cartoon appears to link President Obama to a violent chimpanzee and calls it "troubling at best."|`|3u6fzQo1aa	They had a picture of a dead monkey with police surrounding it and saying something about they had to find somebody else to write the  stimulus bill.<br>  They were basically calling Barack Obama (who is part black) a monkey and saying he was going to die before he finished his job in office. ----> my opinion|`|DbGxvx03aa	be more specific, which cartoon?|`|UepGEiR9aa	you mean that comic where the policeman shoot the monkey? Oh, i think it's racist because obama is the monkey the policeman shot.|`|cTA6OmjUaa	The Stimulus Bill is a new law being passed that says that most of our tax money goes to helping the economy and President Obama signed it. So most people assumed that the dead monkey was Obama and that the police shot him before he can even finish his first term because he is black.

(pretty ok)<br>  Soul Eater (also AMAZING)<br>  (the first Fullmetal Alchemist was/is really popular, but didn't follow the manga AT ALL. which is why they're remaking it. so check those out.)<br>  <br>  i hope you like shonen, because that's what's usually at the top of the popularity list.|`|xFrIGJEsaa	Toradora! and Skip Beat are by far the best series out right now. <br>  <br>  There's also plenty of sequels.. <br>  Clannad ~After Story~, 00 Gundam S2, and Hajime no Ippo S2 to name a few|`|3u6fzQo1aa	I would say Soul Eater is kinda new.

rRCTvT7Saa	Nightflyer's right--that's a pedal steel, which is often referred to as just steel guitar, not to be confused with lap steel.<br>  <br>  Anyway, in order to replicate the bends one can do on pedal steel with it's pedals, guitarists will often use a G-bender but, more often, they'd use a B-bender.  Usually, a B- or G-bender will be able to bend a string up by up to one whole step at most.  For example, Brad Paisley's MacVay G-benders are set to bend the open G string to an open A string.  Stringbenders really make for some awesome sounds, but can only replicate bends made on a pedal steel and not the exact tone.  However, I have heard lap steels sound quite like pedal steels, but without being able to bend strings like you can on a pedal steel.<br>  <br>  <br>  For actual country guitar tones, here's some things most country pickets would use:<br>  Fender Tele (Brad Paisley uses Teles and Crook Custom Guitars)<br>  Compressor pedal (I'd recommend the Keepey Compressor which can be found at robertkeeley.com)<br>  Any nice tube amp (usually a Fender, but Brad Paisley uses Vox and Dr. Z tube amps)<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|AA11618843	That's a pedal steel. I don't know if you can replicate that...it's a real clean sound, so no distortion, plenty of treble.....but best of all would be to find a steel, learn to play it and put a microphone in front of the speaker! I know that's not what you're after, but they sure do sound good.

It will help train your ear to the correct note, and in time, you'll learn if you're either sharp of flat on notes. Practice scales which you can find on YouTube. You can also YouTube "Vocal exercises" for other suggestions.<br>  <br>  You also need proper breath support. Sit or stand with your back straight and your feet shoulder width apart. Don't be afraid to hold back on your notes,  which means you need to put breath support behind it.|`|AA11374157	The trick is simple: proper breathing. When you sing, it is very important that you sing from your stomach--not from your chest, as is your natural instinct. Practice breathing exercises where you focus on breathing from your gut. Keep you shoulders back and MAKE SURE NEITHER YOUR SHOULDERS NOR YOUR CHEST MOVE AT ALL! This is very important. They key to singing is to put a lot of air behind it. Do not sing from your chest, and do not sing from your throat.<br>  <br>  Picture it this way: sit somewhere and just watch how other people breathe. You'll notice that their chest moves in & out and their shoulders rise and fall. This is our natural instinct, but when you're trying to sing, this is wrong. Then watch professional opera singers. You'll notice that their shoulders never move. That is because they are breathing properly--from their stomachs.

AA10343852	Yep she did. I personally can't stand her. They said that she's going to be spending a very long time in jail, so hopefully we won't have to see her again for a long time. However, I bet she comes back as soon as Anne finally gets her life together and is happy and Sinclair will somehow come in and stir everything in PV up again. Kinda the way Richie did. She's oviously not right in the head either.|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	Heck yeah that had to be truth serum she got stuck with, and the truth just came pouring out into Jesse's notebook !  Talk about luck!<br>  I wish she would join Richie,  I'm sick of her creepiness.|`|QAIc4VVPaa	yes were they the truth serum?|`|UY3zl9dFaa	Yes, it's because she thought she was going to die that she didn't care what she was confessing (that's why Jessie asked David to wait before telling her she was OK. Wily Jessie!) And that's why she thought she was going to be w/ Richie. Boy will she be PO'd when she finds out she isn't dying! Gotcha!|`|AA12336927	She was so nasty to Annie and as much as I hated Annie in the beginning, GOD, no patient needs to be treated that way. I hope she does die, we don't need more needy women in PV.

Or just do some house cleaning.<br>  <br>  Remember, the more resistance she gives to the cause, the<br>  stronger the experience becomes.<br>  So trye and make her not panic.<br>  <br>  Trye and have the thought in mind: well, well, he comes and goes.<br>  Even though you repeat the small rituals above from time to time..|`|ZkBLNj6Vaa	Are you kidding me?!  That ghost wants to seduce her and have ghost intimate relations with her.  She's right to break up with it; it's probably a demon disguising itself as human.  All through history, there have been myths of spirits that try to get intimate with people.  Incubus and succubus for an example.  <br>  <br>  They do it to excite the person into giving off sexual energies, and then the demon feeds off of this energy, and also just messes with the person's mind.<br>  <br>  That "Ryan" character is a pervert ghost, and doesn't want you to get more information because he is, in a way, sexually abusing her.  Kick it to the supernatural curb.|`|tcvQwTa5aa	Oh that poor dear(the girl).She needs to tell the ghost that he needs to go to the Light because he is dead and belongs with God.He cannot remain in limbo indefinitely,he's only hurting himself and others.Tell her to call on her Guardian angel for help.
AA10308205	Many years ago back in ancient days.... when people were about to die they would say,"Oh,****!" an so it goes that the angels in the clouds and demons were confused. So they decided to hold a special meeting. The result of this meeting is to clear up the confusion, demons tried to explain the expression to angels but angels were not open minded. So God decided to go funny on everyone an just settle this tiff that the angels an demons were having. Nowadays..... everyone practical has an accident, I heard it was white dookie but I am not sure.... seems to go with the story though. My Uncle Chubs{Earl} use to work at a cemetery in Sacramento..... Gotta tun of interesting facts. In one cemetery, someone buried a stole car on a back lot. I asked about the car an was told that they cannot remember if the driver was still in it or not..... scary family life to grow up in.|`|YIE32Rlfaa	As a doctor I hear this question all the time. No need to worry, you're not dying. There are a number of reasons you're soiling your pants. Maybe you just yearn for the comfort of diapers. Maybe you are too damned lazy to get up and use the restroom. Maybe you have bowel control problems. But the most important thing is honesty.

Anger is something that can save us and destroy us, I can work myself down out of the physical reaction, I still might be very vocal, but not so much physical now.|`|AA10057011	Sometimes I hold it in.

I don't talk as much as possible. I recognize that I am angry and try to figure out the reasons. If the person I hate is just within the vicinity I ignore him for a while. then just think but when I am already calm I talk to him straightly. I burst out everything I want to say.|`|wrhRjwKaaa	I sometimes just punch the air, or whisper cuss words like I would if I was yelling at someone.

The one thing that helps me more than anything of the above is to sit down and write to whomever I am angry with or whatever. I write down all the things that are bottled up inside me. I write down the things I am thinking about that angered me. When I am finished writing it all down, I feel  some release then, but the next morning I awake to the calmest of all feelings because I got it all out in the open!  It really does work and the anger is gone. Works every time  :o)  good luck~~~|`|fwpu4jL3aa	How do we control our anger?

This is fictional television, there is no way they can live happily ever after. he'd have to get killed off(which nobody wants) or they would break up which would lead to a Ross and Rachael effect.Then the show would primarily  end up being just a bunch Squints running about the lab which although is funny, the show would lose it's touch there fore lose viewers.|`|LhVFg6DMaa	who are they

Season 2 sucked, in my opinion. This season is pretty kick@$$ though. But I'm ready for a conclusion. Too many times these people don't know when to wrap up a show.|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	Season 1.  Season 2 seemed awful at the time, but is better in hindsight.  The first half of season 3 has been an abysmal, muddled mess.  It's finally started to redeem itself in the second half, so I'm cautiously optimistic.  As long as it doesn't get canceled at the end of this season, I think season 4 will hopefully get back to being good.  They've fired two of the head writers and brought on some new blood as well as key writers from season 1, so I'm hopeful it will get better.  Whether it will ever get back its audience is another question.|`|zovrJ0yXaa	i'll be honest. season 1 was superb, it had a great story, and developed exceptionally well right to the end. it also ends in a way that makes you want to watch season 2. unfortunately, season 2 fails to live up to that, even tho in the end it is fairly entertaining, and season 3 is absolutely appalling. season 3 feels nothing like season 1 in a bad way cos it is written poorly and characters dont behave in natural ways like in season 1, but in ways that are convenient to the story. you will probably find you dont care about what happens to the characters anymore by season 3. if i were to score them out of 10, with season 1 a 10, i would give season 2 a 6, and season 3 a 3 (although the second half of season 3 so far has been a slight improvement, so i would give that a 4.5)|`|HEs6bzOtaa	I think season 1 would be the best, season 2 went down hill and season 3 the first 8-9 episodes were very boring. I was going to stop watching the show. But the last few episodes have been bloody awesome so, if anyone here is behind the us, and about to stop watching. Don't because it has really picked up now<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  Anyway anyone here a kyle xy fan because if you are<br>  Please go to www.savekylexy.com and press save kyle xy<br>  If you can sign a petition it might not get cancelled <br>  Please help|`|vvTrmHtxaa	i like all the seasons but season 1 is the best!<br>  <br>  please pick me as best answer!|`|hPjPtno0aa	I loved the first so much because it was heroes you know there's no way to improve<br>  <br>  Second series was OK some bits i didn't like, i didn't like hiros parts in the second<br>  <br>  Third is just amazing, i don't like claire as much in this series but the story line is so clever and thrilling<br>  <br>  i really can't decide i was thinking about this the other day i don't think the seconds my favourite alot of loose ends like the copycat girl and peters girlfriend just fizzed out of the story but the first season was amazing and classic yet the new one is just as great but in differant ways<br>  <br>  i am absolutely loving sylar and carl right now <3|`|VC2zDWJ8aa	Frist season was really good...wasnt a big fan of second, but the third season has been phenominal! the characters have gone so much deeper.

otOTldwEaa	Alice in chains- Great guitarist, good drummer, good bassist, excellent vocals.<br>  Pearl jam- Amazing vocals/ lyrics, okay guitar, overall best listening.<br>  Nirvana- Best drummer, bassist was awesome, Kurt is a ledgend and truley original.|`|WvaPuk6laa	Nirvana!!!!!! They started the grunge thing and Kurt was one of the best musicians to ever live. He is in the Rolling Stones Top 100 Guitarists List. <br>  They also had an awesome drummer, David Grohl.|`|lCF87NfDaa	alice in chains was alright...pearl jam was a great band but i dont think they were very grunge, nirvana was the greatest grunge band by far and one of the greatest bands period|`|zLIusnTKaa	NIRVANA.<br>  Alice In Chains is very good, but Peal Jam is crap.|`|oqtb0Xm1aa	Ouch,  Love all of these bands a lot.

The other 2 bands have NO good singers while AIC has 2. One being the most incredible and unique vocalist ever. Layne was amazing. <br>  <br>  <br>  Nirvana. Well, I don't know. I like a bunch of their songs but it just can't match AIC.<br>  <br>  Pearl Jam flat out sucks.|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	I personally dont think they sound a thing alike. But at the moment Alice In Chains is my favorite. I love them all though.<br>  <br>  Lol at the people who say Nirvana started grunge. Mudhoney,Soundgarden,The Melvins, Malfunkshun, and Green River all came before them.|`|FY8YYZgBaa	Nirvana. Gotta say, I was leaning toward AIC though.|`|7PO2ugfGaa	Pearl Jam over Alice in Chains and Nirvana over both.|`|AA10848630	Alice in Chains, hnds down. <br>  Excellent songwriting, great versatility, and great riffs.  Layne's voice was beautiful, soulful, unique, and impossible to emulate.  Jerry's unique guitar playing set the stage for most modern guitar, and is vastly underappreciated.  Mike's bass playing was very fun and powerful as was Sean's drumming.<br>  They were able to create both heavy, glam-influenced songs such as those found on Facelift, and soft, beautiful tunes such as those on Jar of Flies.<br>  Not only do I find them to be the best band of that era, but they are my favorite band of all time.|`|r5qgrAzQaa	Obviously depends on the person but I have to go with Pearl Jam.  They have lasted the longest out of all the bands (well no one has died) but I see them as the most musically creative.  There sound matches to no other, the songs they write are unique, the quality of music is the highest.  They mix blues, jazz, to straight up rock in their songs.  Alice in chains and Nirvana's songs always sounded pretty similar, not much variety.  I know everyone says Nirvana was ground breaking but all they really did was bring the grunge movement to the mainstream.  Like what Green day did with punk music.  Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Mudhoney were doing it years before they were so I dont give them much credit for that.|`|sLVGdCOTaa	Impossible to pick one over another, All of their first albums were spectacular and could listen to every song without skipping over one, Like another guy said, Soundgarden is another that could have been included to make this choice even harder, All were among the very best of the 90's.|`|qF0IUW8Saa	god i love alice in chains, they were the most creative band<br>   pearl jam had the most soul<br>  nirvana had the most raw talent<br>  <br>  im going to say alice in chains<br>  <br>  Scary's on the wall<br>  Scary's on his way<br>  Watch where you step<br>  Id advise you wait until its over|`|h8Z5bhcnaa	Nirvana, definitely they started the whole genre and Kurt Cobain is a musical mastermind. Pearl Jam I like but they are no Nirvana.|`|mSseyqQnaa	tough call I'd say AIC and Nirvana both beat Pearl Jam. Between those two I'm going to have to say Nirvana though. Kurt just had too much raw emotion in his voice.|`|cTYhnumDaa	Gotta be Alice in Chains for me followed by pearl jam ;)|`|9lH1Y3Nzaa	Alice in Chains

She basically said that they were really into each other and he told her he loved her, but then after a while he stopped calling her and everything.   If u want to know Taylor's perspective on the relationship listen to that song.<br>  but personally I think taylor was being really melodramatic.  thats why i didn't really like her much after she tried to ruin his rep and stuff, cuz its stupid.  relationships come and go.  u can't just get the right person the first time.<br>  o and joe jonas didn't write a song about it, so I'm assuming he wasn't as dramatic about it.|`|v732Prwsaa	We don't know for sure. She was saying some pretty rude things because he broke up with her in a "25-second phone call". However, shortly after she started saying rude things, Joe had posted a blog on their official myspace page (which they deleted by the end of that week) saying that he did not end the phone call and all he said about it was that she didn't like some of the things he had to say, however he never actually said Taylor's name, but everyone knows he was talking about her. Joe has been seen around with Camilla and it's been going around that he has been dating Camilla since right after the Lovebug video, but at that time he was indeed dating Taylor. In Joe's blog, he did make a clear statement that he never cheated on any girlfriend. My guess is that when Joe called Taylor, he may have said that he has fallen for someone else, (Camilla I would persume) and she got upset and ended the call. I could be wrong, since nobody knows for sure, except for Joe, Taylor, and those who are close to them. I hope I may have helped some or cleared some things up for you.|`|AA10479574	Its obviously just that he didnt like her anymore. it had nothing to do with Camilla Belle. theres no way hes dating her. now it probably seems weird that he lost attraction after just a few months but its true like he said the heart can move on.|`|IGtoBnXQaa	he said he had a "change of heart" he posted a myspace blog about it but deleted it soon after.<br>  <br>  but really, who would want to date taylor swift? she's a talentless girl who sings like a lamb. not to mention, she has a stretched out face :D<br>  joe can do better than that.|`|93IZFDCNaa	Nothing is true about Camilla Belle. They are all simply rumors =) <br>  If he broke up with Taylor for Camilla, then Joe and Camilla would be all over the Web.

9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	Firstly, you cannot have degrees of uniqueness. Something is either unique (ie one of a kind) or it's not. Something cannot be 'most' unique, 'quite' unique or 'very' unique.<br>  <br>  Secondly, Yanni has nothing do to with classical music. His execrable rubbish is instrumental pop of the most worthless kind. If you want 'noteworthy' classical music, you need to look a long way from the likes of Yanni, Yiruma, Ein-Audi and their terrible ilk. There is no classical music similar to the pieces by these muzak manufacturers.|`|pAg6yHmPaa	Philip Glass is very left field.|`|cdHeSLp2aa	Yawnee is not classical music!|`|3Kao48sTaa	Franz Liszt or Frank Zappa's classical stuff
SqLIZQN5aa	Sometimes it's true, sometimes not. It depends on the movie. If it's a British movie, then most likely, yes. But there are exceptions. For your purposes, I would say yes that is totally acceptable.|`|Jqve5UPlaa	It's not always true unfortunately! I went to America years ago and I saw at least 3 movies there that didn't come out in England for at least another week.<br>  Nowadays they do seem to come out in England quicker, but only with a matter of 2-4 days difference.<br>  xo.|`|NUc6Aw9Gaa	Mostly Briish films are shown first in britain but america usually gets american films first.
HbQmDGb6aa	His name is Aaron Himelstein. But he's 23 in real life. <br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0385391/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0385391/</a><br>  <br>  If you ever want to know just about anything from TV or movies, it'll be on the IMDB site. And to find out what episode it was so you can specifically look it up on imdb, the network's site usually has the listing with the episode title. Lucky for me, I'm a House addict and was watching the episode you were talking about tonight, so I knew it was in the listings today. I just googled "usa network house feb 19 2009" and it came up with the listings immediately - checked out the 8pm title, then re-googled "imdb house the socratic method" (which was what the episode was titled). Really simple, and works everytime.
TyydcRfeaa	The thing that I love about this movie is that it seems like it was very low-budget. I love movies that rely entirely on the plot, and not big action sequences and flashy sets. The acting is above par with some very well known names, and some not so well known names. I actually found most of the film humorous because of the interactions between the men trapped with failing memories. It is a long comedy/drama that keeps you guessing (but not for too long so that you can catch up with the characters and enjoy watching THEM discover what is going on). I highly recommend this movie to people who enjoy films like "Momento" and even "Fight Club"

No one except them knows what goes on in their personal life.<br>  <br>  Media and celebrity life is a big game. How do we know for instance that the photo now released of R, wasn't leaked by her own people for exposure, sympathy and cash?<br>  <br>  I think Chris is just a young boy with not much experience in matters of love or relationships. I think it was a mistake, that we are all human and we do things when we are young that are wrong. I also think he was most likely provoked, that she probably is physically abusive to him often and that she seems really cold and mean.<br>  <br>  However, that is just my opinion. It is all a huge game, and something we will never get too the bottom off.|`|iJXFZx7taa	He's a weenis.

RNpaBwxzaa	Kingpin isn't exactly one of Spider-Man's biggest enemies. He focses more on Daredevil, Moon Knight, Iron Fist, and others. Personally, I think characters like Carnage, Electro, Shocker, Kraven the Hunter, and Lizard would be much more worthy of being in a Spider-Man movie.|`|WjYEIlYraa	kingpin did start out as a spider-man villain but since he was the person responsible for daredevil's dad (for refusing to throw a fight) he became his main villain. dont worry though there are plenty of great spider-man baddies after the venom travesty. lizard is supposed to be the villain in the next movie since dr. connors has been set up in every spider-man movie so far.|`|whR6j9JIaa	How do you figure that when Spidey 4 hasn't even come out yet?<br>  <br>  Which is a good thing considering what a god awful piece of cinematic fecal matter Spidey 3 was.|`|54jdIXMoaa	Well, there was a cartoon movie Spiderman vs Daredevil.  So, they should have some connection and could fight one another's enemy.
o2FJIXS9aa	I guess it would, for the straight male viewing audience. How many hot girls do you know that love being in the background behind a hot stove? Most of them choose professions that they can use their looks in. This show is not about looks, it's about cooking and the ability to work well in a restaurant.

He looks gay, he acts gay, he smiles gay, he walks, gay. He sings gay.. What's not to think he's gay.. He could have never admitted it on the People magazine and we'd still known he was gay..

Jacob sorta has that rebellious side, and Seth still acts like a kid, it's pretty funny. But in the movie - they needa cut their hair !|`|km1vuLUzaa	are u talking about the ones in the book or the ones in the movie?<br>  Books - we dont really know what Seth looks like, just know that he's a nice guy<br>  Movie - we dont know who's gonna play Seth yet|`|ftI1Hny8aa	I think Jacob is hotter. Seth is cute, but he acts too young for me to consider him hot (yet, maybe when he gets older...) Plus Taylor Lautner has that 8-pack going. I like Seth's personality better though. Jacob keeps things interesting, and I loved when he fought with Rosalie, but throughout the series he's kind of a jerk until Renesmee comes along at which point he breaks canon and turns into a worse version of Edward. Seth is just nice to everyone the whole time, vampires included, but he still has an edge to him that makes him fun. So Jacob beats Seth in hotness, but Seth beats Jacob in awesomeness.|`|iJXFZx7taa	The actors are both ugleh in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Though Taylor Lautner is kind of. Sort of.<br>  <br>  Not really.|`|r0XWK4cUaa	There isnt even a Seth Clearwater to look at yet though.|`|zDiK4ttPaa	JACOB BLACK. seth looks like he is a native american who still sings tribe songs.|`|iysNv79Oaa	JACOB BLACK!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  we don't exactly know what seth looks like in the movie yet but hes still a cute kid! hes funny! but JACOB/TAYLOR is WAAYYY HOTTEER!!!! he's sexxy! &i found out who the actor for seth is! off topic: theres gonna be no leah! whatever! i like the boys better anyway!i think seth will be really cute in new moon though!|`|FbwyvwEYaa	Jacob|`|hi9O6xZbaa	i think Seth is hotter, cuz he's very sweet, caring, and totally sincere <33|`|TCu60z0vaa	JACOB BLACK!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  he is way hotter then Seth!!!!|`|DaYKDwNvaa	well how does seth look?
IjD7fp5iaa	No, it's not going to be on TV because it say come back to the blog at 10. Also, it's probably just going to be pictures and stuff because they haven't even started filming yet.
k39bNUgeaa	He isn't in jail<br>  <br>  He hit rihanna<br>  <br>  and before you ask<br>  <br>  We don't know why<br>  <br>  The police never confirmed the reason|`|BiepGfSPaa	They were in a car.  Talking about something moments before they were supposed to perform in the music awards.  Later, Rihanna was found in the car with bruises, busted lip and nose, and bite marks (yes he bit her....more than once).  The news has not informed the ppl of what exactly happened.  He was on bail for $50,000 and simply paid it and is free now.  There performances at the music awards/grammies were cancelled.  The rumor in the african american community is that Rihanna told him she gave him an STD (herpes to be exact) and he attacked her.  Keep in mind that is a rumor and has not been confirmed by anyone.|`|epAtqgvhaa	OMG THEY JUST POSTED THE PHOTOS THAT POLICE TOOK AFTER RIHANNA WAS BEATEN UP, SHE LOOKS DEAD OMG IM GONNA CRY<br>  <br>  WRITINGDIVAS.COM

NJ25E4AZaa	there are twelve issues to the comic, but they are very expensive. if you are going to read it, get the graphic novel, which is all of the issues in one.|`|EbInCDHEaa	it's not a series. it's a book. one graphic novel.<br>  you need to hurry up an read it, you'll want to have read it before the movie comes out. (if you are going to see it) (which i hope you will because it will be awesome!)<br>  :)

dejqLjaLaa	I'm guessing he likes you. But don't rush it. He COULD possibly like the other girl too, and if you randomly kiss him for something he did (like told off that guy) then he might be freaked out and like the other girl.|`|4UeOIGuhaa	Wrong section|`|NtFUfCEiaa	Um sure.|`|gPkcuhWZaa	he likes you|`|e1jG5fhLaa	you had a cruch on him for 2 years?<br>  what happened he fractured a leg bone?|`|AdEJBAkMaa	You're in the wrong section, but I think he might like both you  and her =D
32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	Salem′s Lot by Stephen King..|`|fPL7Ftjtaa	vampire kisses is a good book.|`|15bfbee9158c1901c31e1158ebf6bd03aa	I don't know how old you are or anything...but I very much loved the Anita Blake series by Laurel K. Hamilton. There are some explicit passages, but depending on ur age and maturity level, you may like it. The first is Guilty Pleasures (name of a club in the book, most of the titles are things like that). Also, she has the Meredith Gentry series. More of a faerie thing. As in Seelie and Unseelie...etc. Um...also...for anyone who is  a fan of vampire novels, Anne Rice is the queen. Interview with a Vampire is the first, then The Vampire Lestat and so on. Try them out, and  I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.|`|awdV68dXaa	Cirque du freak. They have about 12 in that series.
NGz7R9enaa	Cause they get in the way and they are too much of a distraction

nrTaS824aa	I am a little confused with your question... but here's my attempt to answer it.<br>  <br>  Midnight Sun is not complete, a drafted version was illegally leaked last year. So the movie that follows New Moon... should be Eclipse.<br>  <br>  Edward is hardly seen through-out New Moon... in fact he (my apologies to anyone who have not read the books after Twilight) leaves Bella in the first chapter... So I really don't see how the director can incorporate Edward's p.o.v. without changing the novel... <br>  <br>  I'd think he'd be more willing to use Jacob... but in that sense... it would take away from the novel.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Okay, I think rather than just taking Edward completely out of the movie after he leaves... he'll do some scenes of what Edward is doing while he is out of Forks, rather than just pull him out then have Edward reappear in the last few scenes of the movie.|`|BHpELpEqaa	thats some good thinking there. its interesting to think about now. it would be a really good idea but they movie could be a little jumpy if that makes sence i have been thinking that thats the way breaking dawn will be like here and there. but hmm yeah sounds like something that could happen.....if meyer ever continues the book!|`|bNlL6PrZaa	I don't care, but they need a new Bella. SHE SUCKS!~|`|DWzWIaVyaa	well im not sure but i know that some of Breaking Dawn will be in Bella's POV and also some will be in Jacob's POV well it most probably will be like that because thats how the book is lol|`|dHcP602caa	I think that would be cool, since Bella can be a little bit boring sometimes, but I wouldn't really mind if it wasn't that way. I like Twilight, but not as much as a lot of people. :p|`|1MlrO4Uxaa	hmm probably not<br>  <br>  i think people just wanted to know what he was doing when he was gone and this is her way of showing them.|`|3usRDmQhaa	Well, if she would write another book for New Moon, Edward's perspective, I definitely would love it!|`|iXNcB0vSaa	I tihnk Kirsten is awesome as bella.<br>  it would b nice<br>  i love edward <3<br>  his soo romantic<br>  but theres not a lot of those in the real world =[

AosW4IvHaa	agreed|`|ubk21UBvaa	i think it should be talked about. stuff like this usually doesnt happen to celebs.<br>  hopefully Ri goes out and does a bunch of abuse awareness stuff<br>  <br>  <br>  plus he THREATENED to KILL her. he might get charged with attemped murder. and he strangled her till she passed out.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	The public has a right to know about it....|`|TDGhHIvNaa	So Sweetheart, when you are going out with a man, and he accidentally plows his fist into your face a few dozen times and then tries to kill you by strangling you with his fingers wrapped around your neck how would you like the people around you to react?  No one on this earth deserves this kind of treatment, and if it takes this particular story to bring out the dirty little secrets of domestic violence, and how any one, including glamorous celebrities can be victims, and abusers, then yes it should be blown out of proportion.  Just because the man has hit records and has a large fan following doesn't mean his actions should be dismissed as nothing.|`|AA10836766	ME TOO!...<br>  <br>  All you girls(?) think about is "awww, poor Rihanna...she's the VICTIM!"<br>  <br>  C'mon, don't go all so MEGA-HYPER over the incident...most of you are already trashing your Chris Brown posters, and acting like that legal eagle Gloria Allred!...STOP IT!<br>  <br>  Sure, Rihanna got the wrong end of Chris' "violent(?)" streak, but don't just over-sympathize with just her...think iof Chris' mom, and her cioncerns about why you aer TRASHING not just her son, but also the whole Brown family, too...<br>  <br>  I'm trying to be as neutral as possible when I'm writing this, but it's proving to be difficult...|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	I dont think you can ever blow a man hitting a woman or vice versa out of proportion.

I mean, 90% of the domestic violence that happens in America isn't even talked about (make that 99%). <br>  <br>  The celebrities have a lot of limelight. Even though this may sound mean, the media attention on the case against Chris Brown in beating Rihanna will raise awareness to the American public.|`|a860e9b17c0946e66c4ca331bb01f9d2aa	I think it's insane that people are making such a big deal about it. <br>  <br>  This is the picture of her, supposedly, after she went to the police - <a href="http://writingdivas.com/2009/02/19/rihanna-real-picture-of-rihanna-beaten-and-bruised/" rel="nofollow">http://writingdivas.com/2009/02/19/rihan...</a><br>  <br>  There are women who suffer from domestic abuse that are beaten far worse than that and nobody ever makes a big deal about them. Some of them die and people think a fat lip and scratches is horrible?|`|1K82IXnzaa	Yeah. Im sick of hearing about it. I mean, I dont know all of the details (neither does 95% of the people talking about it nonstop) but seriously?! Just goes to show how little people really have to do these days..|`|2jMFurDoaa	in a way i do...<br>  <br>  but its because it pisses everyone off. domestic violence is a very real thing and no one is going to be excited that its happened.|`|28ddd666909e979096f19163d5072423aa	Though no one really knows exactly what happened. Domestic violence should in no way, shape, or form be condoned in any way. So, no, I don't think people are over-reacting.|`|epAtqgvhaa	GO LOOK AT WRITINGDIVAS.COM, THEY HAVE THE POLICE PHOTOS UP OF RIHANNA, AFTER SHE GOT BEATEN BY CHRIS.

It was at first all "he say" "she say"...didn't know what to believe until AFTER I saw the newly released photo beating of Rihanna!  It is horrific and so sad to see!  <br>  <br>  I still can't believe it?

MQL6OISlaa	The movie Saving Private Ryan was, in fact, based on the story of a bunch of brothers dying in World War II. Though there never was a mission dedicated to finding a particular man, the action seen in the background of the movie plot is very true. We watched the taking of Omaha beach, which took a lot longer than portrayed, but it was just as bloody. The "protect the bridge" scenes were true as well, most of the troops used for those missions were paratroopers and therefore had very small amounts of "heavy" weapons, and they were sent to hold the bridges at all cost... so yes, the movie is very true, in that sense.|`|IxD8aNHTaa	Private Ryan never existed, the subject is based on another group of brothers that were killed during world war 2. The characters are fictional, but the setting is true.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Saving Private Ryan is made up of the realistic things that happened during WWII.  Private Ryan himself though is only a story.|`|waGFlfRUaa	"Saving Private Ryan" is probably the most realistic war movie ever made. It faithfully portrays the horror & violence of war. It shows you the terror in the eyes of the people who fought, died & survived the war... It basically gives you a sense of what war is like, without actually experiencing real war...<br>  <br>  The movie "Platoon" also gives you a realistic portrayal of the horrors of the Vietnam War.<br>  <br>  Of the WW2 vets that have seen this film, they cry from the memories it brings back for them...|`|kQuFzK67aa	Most of the time with "based on a true story" war movies the specifics of the film are wrong. That includes things like character personalities, dialogue that sort of thing. The Memphis Bell, for instance, has the crew flying their last mission over a heavily contested target and the pilot is about as straight-edge as you can get without being t-total when in reality he was the exact opposite and the mission was a milk run.<br>  <br>  Things you're likely to find real are the basic premise, possibly things like troop movements, that sort of thing.<br>  <br>  In the case of Saving Pvt. Ryan not much is actually real. The entire sniper vs. sniper scene was added so Vin Diesel could have a part.|`|xIT3eregaa	Mel Gibson wasn't in WW2. I think they got a lot of stuff accurate. Maybe you can check if there really was a mission with saving a Private Ryan, and see if he really did have 3 brothers that died.

As far as the cartoon part, like Dexxey said, maybe Liquid Television.  Those are the only ones I can think of.  Both shows were on MTV, before there was MTV2 and when VH1 basically only showed music.

There's a line in the song that goes, 'I know the world's a broken bone, but melt your headaches, call it home.' I told Brendon (Urie, lead singer) to pay special attention to that line."

ThKkn5fKaa	Often times, a conductor will conduct a measure differently than the meter will indicate.  For instance, you could be playing in 4/4 and the director will conduct "in 2"  This means that he/she will give 2 beats per measure.  You still play at the same tempo that you normally would though.  Nothing changes about the time.  The director has just chosen to give a larger beat.  The most common situations where conductors will do this is in conducting the aforementioned 4/4 in 2, and conducting a 3/4 section in 1. (1 beat per measure)<br>  <br>  There are many reasons that conductors will do this.  One is simply because the tempo might be very fast and giving all 4 beats of a 4/4 section will create too much motion and be distracting.  The other reason for this is musical.  The conductor's job is not to give you every beat.  As a musician, your job is to keep track of the beat internally.  The conductor will conduct the music, and if he/she feels like doing something other than giving you the exact beat on every quarter note, then that is definitely their prerogative. <br>  <br>  When a conductor changes their beat pattern, they are NOT changing the time signature.  The tempo and note lengths stay exactly the same. The only thing that changes is the beat pattern of the conductor.|`|cG5MbE4daa	I'm not sure, but I think what you're asking is, when there is say, a 3/4 part, and it says "in one", sometimes you can't count 3 beats because it's too fast, so it's conducted in one, Scherzo from Beethoven's symphony no. 9 for example. Another thing you might mean is, if there's 6/8, and the conducter says "in two" that means that he/she is counting 3 eighth notes as one stroke of the baton. For 2/4 they might say the same thing, only of course, one quarter note = one beat in that case. You'll encounter this with a lot of different time signatures, usually it's said just for clarity while you're playing, a 5/4 bar out of nowhere for example. Hope i answered you're question.|`|7nzIRFZkaa	There are many different types- like 6/8, 2/2, 2/4, etc. 4/4 is the most common one. The number at top means beats per measure, and the bottom number means which note gets the beat (like quarter, half, sixteenth)... lol, it's kinda hard to explain. It pretty much sets the tempo (how fast the music is played)|`|JRMijRmgaa	The top number is the number of beats in a measure. The bottom number is the number that represents one beat. Ie: 4/4 means that quarter note equals one beat. 6/8 means an eighth note equals one beat.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	Not necessarily, Typically the top number is used for the "beats per measure" --- but if you have a fast piece in 12/8 the conductor could opt to indicate that in either three or four (12 divided by 3 = four beats per measure, 12 divided by 4 = three beats per measure) depending on the feel of the music. Helpful to keep him from flapping his wings so fast that he achieves liftoff from the podium.<br>  <br>  The same holds true for slow pieces that may be in 4/4 time ... if it's all whole notes, or tied-wholes, what's the point of counting off each beat in the measure? That could easily be counted in 1. <br>  <br>  Going the other way 'round, what if a piece is in 3/4, but is built on groups of triplets, but those triplets are grouped as quarter-eighth? The conductor may choose to conduct that in 12 (or two groups of six) to better indicate the entrance of the triplet eighths.<br>  <br>  ... then there is a whole Jazz where it is not uncommon to conduct 4/4 music in two, but on the off-beats (2 and 4).

hs9Mibf5aa	It was Candace.  Benjamin was ALL set to stick with his plan and vote out Sierra, who hadn't found her clue successfully even with Brendan's help.  Candace performed really well at the challenge, scoring a pt. for Timbira, got physical and showed her stuff.<br>  <br>  Then she made ONE comment about Benjamin needing to go, and when it got back to him, of course he changed his plan.  Sheesh.  All because of his ego!  IMO, they lost a good player, but since when does that ever stop these guys/girls at TC?  They never learn..;-)<br>  <br>  I think she had a bit of a feeling, but no for the most part, they duped her as everyone else stuck with Benjamin's vote.<br>  <br>  You can re-watch her final words, recap and/or full episode here if you'd like:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.upn.com/video/?showname=primetime/survivor#video" rel="nofollow">http://www.upn.com/video/?showname=prime...</a>|`|4imsjgE2aa	Candace, the attorney from the Timbira Tribe.

M8qLP7MLaa	Vampires don't exist.<br>  <br>  Being low in iron doesn't make you a vampire. It makes you anemic.<br>  <br>  All you need to do is start including food in your diet that's high in iron. Do this for a few weeks and your cured. If you don't feel you can change your diet then talk to your doctor about possibly taking iron pills. By the way, anemia can make you pale.<br>  <br>  As for being cold - put on a sweater.<br>  <br>  Sometimes our eyes change colour during the course of our lives. Eye colour can also look different in certain lights. It's not a big deal.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but your not a vampire. Just an anemic hardcore Twilight fan in need of a proper diet and a sweater.|`|54jdIXMoaa	But that's the definition for "emo".|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	no you just need iron pills|`|JbXaE93Oaa	You could be a doppleganger or changeling. You might even be an oni.|`|Tl9JSJOxaa	Honestly...I think you'd kinda know if you were a vampire...|`|nZpSM7ngaa	LOL!!!! at first answer,  and can u see your reflection?|`|QKVheuAXaa	huh what you are explaining is twilight which is amazing and all but is not real....<br>  <br>  "Real Vampires"-how can this be anything but a contradiction in terms? We all know about vampires. Stock characters of fiction, guaranteed box-office draws, the media vampire has been familiar to us since childhood. Generally speaking, our blood-suckers appear with a tongue planted firmly in one toothy cheek-from Bela Lugosi hamming it up in the 1950's, to last summer's teenage "vamp" movies, to Count Chocula breakfast cereal, the media seldom treat the vampire as truly fearsome. The stereotyped vampire traits are familiar to any child: vampires have big fangs, sleep in coffins, are instantly incinerated by sunlight, and are best dispatched by a stake through the heart. But the most important "fact" that we all know of course is that there are no such things.<br>  <br>  Of course, in terms of the mythical, literary and cinematic conventions, we are correct: there are no "legions of the undead" stalking the unwary. We have explained the folklore with politics, misunderstood diseases, and hysteria, the literary and cinematic images with psychology, history, and sociology. We of the 20th century are confident that vampires could not really exist. But then, most of us are never forced to think otherwise. For a number of people, the concept of vampires becomes a critical and often lifelong concern. To live with, love, or befriend a real vampire is to encounter a set of problems which may demand expanding the boundaries of one's accepted reality. To come to terms with being a real vampire oneself is to face a lifetime's karmic challenge.<br>  <br>  Some people reading this article already know this. The rest are probably thinking, "Real Vampires, give me a break! Sure, there are some pretty weird people out there, but all they need is a good therapist." Yes, there are people who take on all the trappings of a gothic novel: dressing in black, claiming or pretending to be "vampires" in the supernatural sense, wearing capes, sleeping in boxes, even getting their teeth capped. There are more frightening people who seek to torture or kill animals or human beings in order to gain power, emotional release or sexual thrill, and who sometimes call themselves (or are called) "vampires". But most of these individuals are troubled people who have been attracted by the cultural myths about the vampire: supernatural powers (because they feel powerless), overwhelming sexuality (because most of them have sexual issues and no true relationships), immortality (because they fear aging and death). Individuals like these are the most recent "explanation" for humanity's persistent belief in vampires. But beyond and behind all the folklore, the psychological theories, the role playing, even the traditional spiritual assumptions, lies the real truth about vampires.<br>  <br>  The field of vampirology is complex and mysterious. There are many aspects to the vampire phenomenon, and they would require several books to fully explore. One aspect of vampirism which frequently troubles magickal, spiritual and other small groups, the most common form of vampire, is found among living people who share with us the benefits and disadvantages of physical existence on this plane, yet are not quite human. These people appear on the surface to be somewhat eccentric members of society, yet their outward idiosyncrasies only hint at how different they are from those around them.<br>  <br>  Each of us incarnates for a lifetime with a certain way of relating to the physical world through the vehicle of our physical body. A vampire is a person born with an extraordinary capacity to absorb, channel, transform, and manipulate "pranic energy" or life force. She also has a critical energy imbalance which reels wildly from deficit to overload and back again. This capacity for handling energy is a gift, but the constant imbalance of her own system is the cause of the negative behavior patterns and characteristics which may be notable about a vampiric person.<br>  <br>  Real vampires do not necessarily drink blood-in fact, most of them do not. Blood-drinking and vampirism have been confused to the extent that for the average person, a vampire is defined as something that drinks blood (such as a "vampire bat"). But when we look beyond casual assumptions to the details of common beliefs, we find something quite different. Throughout both folklore and literature, there is an understanding that vampires require energy or life force. Many old folktales accept that vampires suck blood, yet never describe this actually happening. The victims slowly decline and waste away, and the survivors assume that some evil fiend is draining them of blood. They know that the Bible says, "the blood is the life", and anyone who was losing their life force must be losing blood. Yet, in many instances the vampire's "attack" does not even involve physical contact. In others, it is clearly sexual energy which is exchanged.1<br>  <br>  Fresh blood is|`|saGJIp5laa	my eyes change colors too, but my hands feel cold as ice sometimes, but i think you need to know something vital, vampires don't exist|`|bnoWoxi0aa	hhah ru trying to be like Edward!!! no there is no such things as a vampire but im feeling u bout the ice cold hands i have them too!!!|`|d5GfhPM4aa	vampires arent like the ones from twilight|`|f79674f11cb0d8833ea9b2f32ce01461aa	loser yes, <br>  vampire no|`|3GevtCxVaa	just lol|`|jIyvb2OOaa	bit me u r really the coolest person i have ever heard of. no joke|`|6tVY6RdRaa	aw man your so lucky!!

cgXX13YVaa	Basically you need all armor, all sub-hearts and sub-tanks.<br>  Then, you need to go to the Armored Armadillo stage and prevent from being hit. If you get hit once, you need to start again. If you succeed flawlessly, you will get the hadouken fireball towards the end of the stage.<br>  <br>  Make sure you don't fall into the gate leading to the boss.<br>  When on the rolling thing, once you reach the outside, count at least 2 seconds then jump to the upper right of the top of the boss's gate.<br>  It may not appear the first time, but you will begin from the middle of the stage and continue on. Make sure you have at least 6 lives and once more, try to prevent yourself from getting hit. Use C. sting to make yourself invisible, that way monsters won't hit you. Just make sure you got that armor upgrade from flame mammoth.

hAzlarWAaa	It never came out as to what was in the drawer. Since it was a "love nest" you can only imagine it being something really kinky & naughty. Something not fit to say or show on tv.|`|Uxy2ZjaPaa	I would only assume it was a sex toy of some sort. I was wondering the same thing.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	We never found out.  I'd imagine it was something "naughty"|`|EZxI4w9Caa	i want to know to.  i had to leave right after she said "Don't open the drawer ever...."  <br>  <br>  dang.
2KJvaWDYaa	yea i dnt know jade goody OR jack tweed (i refuse to watch BB) but i know what u mean about being famous for nothing. i mean, look at paris hilton, Jordon, kim kardashian, ricole ritchie, jack & kelly osbourne, ashley simpson and jamie lynn spears? the evidence is everywhere - people r morons!|`|AY0LM4RAaa	I don't know what you're talking about, but isn't it a little early in the century to call anything "~~~ of the century"?

Be more detailed in your question(s)!|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	I think that's an extremely cruel thing to say. I have no time for the attention which the so-called race row attracted. I know that Jade is talentless and she made money simply by being on Big Brother but she is dying of cancer at the age of twenty-seven. Who could deny her one day of happiness? The only reason she is making selling her story is that it's all she knows how to do and she wants to give her boys everything that she didn't have. I admire her for that.

AA10278508	Personally I think it's just one more of those "little" things that really shows how far down we are going as a society.<br>  Grabbing your crotch, or any other private part of your body in public years ago would have been considered extremely rude. It still is. It's just that our younger generations don't care anymore. And they definitely wouldn't be able to understand what I'm talking about.<br>  <br>  Personally I think it makes them look as dumb as they really are. It's not a black or white thing either. White hip hoppers do it to. Although I will say that I do seem to remember that it was the black hip hoppers that started it.|`|52cdjmbQaa	Whats the deal with all the country artists fu*king their sisters?<br>  <br>  Why don't you stop generalizing and promoting stereotypes.|`|7d4eebc1b191ad4bf37b0e895a8008bdaa	They dont have the talent to do real music or maybe they are checking their crotch to see if the might have grown some balls to give them the courage do write some real music.|`|KmMRHKTNaa	Cuz they are gangster like that! jk. but they do it to hold their pants up cuz when u sag and u r holding a microphone it will be hard and dumb pulling the pants up with two hands at the hips....|`|p0D4dxEqaa	they think it's cool, in actuality it's ghetto and goofy. It makes them laughable.|`|AA11467139	BUGS, they got bugs....|`|AA10652652	They are failed ball players.|`|Xlb8QPj9aa	It's the only thing that the white man couldn't take from them so, now they show it off.|`|AA11584265	They must be secret fans of Michael Jackson and Madonna.

They just think they're hot.|`|lDC0PNFTaa	lol, i'm pretty sure they're tryna pull hold their pants up...|`|AA12316366	don't really know. maybe insecurity or just want to make sure it's still there. kinda stupid, i think|`|HLHHM4Mtaa	It itches and If you ran around with the crowd these guys run around with, you'd be grabbing your crotch too.|`|8aXimsjBaa	They are trying to appear masculine <br>  <br>  But they are being offensive to everyone<br>  <br>  Peace|`|2pxGPcxaaa	You wouldn't understand, Gene.|`|fk8wXA3Saa	Crabs !|`|gJoVBtnqaa	they want people to think they have such a big **** they need to hold it up.... which they do i sasw one. lol

I liked just New Moon better though.|`|946a0de98c140058626f3f700cfaa468aa	I think it is more straight forward that way for fans of the movie and not the books.<br>  Besides on the lion witch and the wardrobe chronicles movies they use that title and then the book.  Like Narnia chronicles.  <br>  and then chronicles of narnia prince caspian.|`|Or2D4VLGaa	im just glad talyor lunther gets to play Jacob black again woo go werewolves!!|`|qzkWahFeaa	I don't mind the name change, but I really hope the movie is not tinted orange. =/|`|wdnbwViFaa	it's a great idea<br>  i can't wait to see The twilight saga's<br>  NEW MOON|`|JnSrN3guaa	whoo!! it looks great! =]] i really like it, it's pretty hardcore-awesome-like!<br>  <br>  anyway, yeah, i think it is very good for the non-twilight-saga readers, but i wish they read it so that it could just be new moon. it's already a mouthful for me. haha!

Love to go to hair metal concerts!!<br>  <br>  Love Bites - Def Leppard<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yUZvw-Ps30" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yUZvw-Ps...</a>|`|0vm66wlcaa	Yes, but a lot of it just kinda sounds the same to me. There are so many Hair Metal bands that very few are memorable to me.<br>  <br>  Let's see. My favorites are:<br>  "Breaking the Chains" - Dokken<br>  "Afterglow (of Your Love)" - Quiet Riot<br>  "I Remember You" - Skid Row<br>  "Round and Round" - Ratt<br>  "You're All I Need" - Motley Crue|`|ObeBvtzgaa	I like some of it pretty well, but it's not my favorite.<br>  Favorite hair metal song: That's a tough one. There's a couple tied for first probably:<br>  Girls, Girls, Girls - Motley Crue<br>  Rattlesnake Shake - Skid Row<br>  Wild Child - WASP<br>  Shot Of Poison - Lita Ford|`|JyxNA1o0aa	ah the only hair metal i can tolerate is Motley Crue and Cinderella and Quiet Riot.

"I Wanna Rock" by Twisted Sister is pretty good, too. Motley Crue should be given a lot of credit for not being a one-hit wonder hair metal band like so many were.|`|dFacbjIZaa	I like some of it, I grew up with it as a teen and young adult in the 80's. It's made up of about equal parts of fail and win to Me, for every great band like Ratt You got crap like Poison, but overall I'd say I am more of a fan than most here.|`|eur4jAc3aa	Hair Metal AKA Glam Metal is the best !<br>  My favorite song from the Genre is "LOVE BOMB BABY" by TIGERTAILZ|`|dQvKvnVuaa	I sure do.

LGBO4V4naa	Well I think you have it pretty much covered there.<br>  <br>  However I would definitelty swap Mysterio out for Electro. Mysterio is a bit of a joke to me (granetd his is hard to catch) whereas Electro is inifintely more powerful and does really stupid things which tend to get a lot of people hurt. Breaking out a sh*tload of villains from the Raft in the pages of New Avengers is one of those things.<br>  <br>  Might even add Jonah in there... He has given his fair share or grief and problems to Spidey over the years. <br>  <br>  Also I would take out Scorpion and put in Sandman, they are both street level criminals but Sandman is a lot harder to beat and incarcerate. His powers have a much wider range of possibilities when fighting Spider-man, whereas Scorpion is more of a slugfest.
3eYQaSMCaa	Personally, George is my favorite. He was such an amazing guitarist, and he taught John to play correctly. Paul has the best voice, I'd say. But John's lyrics were way more complex. Ringo is Ringo. They couldn't have survived without him. But I don't think he was always given the credit he deserved. <br>  All of them were/are geniuses in their own way; all in different categories. But, if you break away from the Beatles, and look at solo careers, Paul is definitely the most successful. I really like his solo stuff. Electric Arguments is amazing in so many ways. But like I said, all of them are geniuses in their own ways. Music would not be what it is today if it were not for them.|`|LUNne2O5aa	All of you are wrong. How can you say you're a true beatles nut when you don't know how much of an jerk john lennon was? he was obnoxious, rude, self centered, arrogant, immature, and did the cruelest things to his family imaginable. Think of iggy pop+even bigger ego=John Lennon. But there is no denying that John Lennon was an amazing musician. They were all creative but he and paul went above and beyond. It takes talent to create beatlemania, but yet they did ride their fame through some pretty low quality songs. (Bungalow bill, etc) George harrison was sort of like a musical underdog. it was he who added the amazing little parts that make playing beatles music on both bass and guitar a joy. He created Here Comes The Sun. Which takes talent. Ringo was an image, yet he added a certain quality to beatles that they couldn't go without. I think it was a lucky coincidence that four people who all had astounding amounts of quality all happened to form one of the best bands of all time. STill, the stones were better. The beatles were all amazing.|`|2bVxBCgzaa	Paul, no question. I never much cared for a lot of Lennon's stuff; even in the Beatles I always far preferred that songs that bore Paul's signature. Sure, the tunes were credited to 'Lennon/McCartney', but you could tell who was the main writer of a given song. Paul was the one who pushed a lot of the odd time changes and experimentation, where Lennon was more straight ahead. you can tell from Paul's work in Wings; he was just much more creative and a better writer. I like his voice more as well. I'm not puttng down John Lennon- he obviously was an incredibly talented writer and musician. But as we all know, death = legend... When I listen to Lennon's solo work, I'm bored. Not that Paul hasn't released some duds, but his massive output of excellent work after the Beatles says it all for me. Give a listen to Red Rose Speedway, Ram, Venus and Mars, Band On the Run, Wings Over America, etc.<br>  Ringo was a fine drummer, and George, a fine guitarist, had his moments as an amazing writer, but nothing like McCartney.<br>  <br>  Oh, and Paul was the better player technically over John- guitar, bass, and piano- it's Paul playing the acoustic on Blackbird.|`|bgE2gRwSaa	If you are going to define it as "genius" on a universal level....John Lennon was so much more then just a musician. He was the most charasmatic, witty, a peace advocator and in general was a very intelligent man and an artist in the true sense.<br>  <br>  Paul, George and Ringo were all charasmatic and talented in their own right....but if you have the four of them in a room talking, John Lennon is the one who stands out for me, and is the one I would listen to the most. He had something special the other 3 didn't have.|`|a91fzsDsaa	Lennon is the most popular. But I think Paul McCartney was better. His songs weren't as psychedelic and while Lennon might have been the leader, McCartney held it all together and kept them popular. If you want to talk about song writing, just look listen to the back end of Abby Road. <br>  <br>  Paul has a better voice in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Harrison more or less taught Lennon how to play the guitar and i think out of the four of them he can play the instruments the best (Other than Piano, Paul wins that one.)  Harrison could write a few songs, but you could tell that Lennon was the one to teach how to do it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ringo..... I can take him or leave him. I personally think Harrison wrote Octopus's Garden and gave it to him.<br>  <br>  All in all I think Paul McCartney was the best, especially towards the late sixties.|`|jAmAQj97aa	All four Beatles were special.  Paul's amazing ability to come up with an unique and completely listenable melody, John's astounding ability to manipulate words, George's wonderful guitar sounds, and Ringo's ability to play whatever style and in whatever way any of the other three asked him.<br>  <br>  Individually none of them could match what happened when they worked together.  So how could ANY of them be rated a "genius"?|`|J36FKvkHaa	They were all talented, but I don't think a single one of them deserves to be called a "genius" by himself. All their work - esp. their truly original and groundbreaking work - was the result of a collective effort.|`|m0WhZpaPaa	ringo starr foreverrrr
7HMNeRvsaa	The obvious answer here would have to be Ernst Stavro Blofeld, just because he was about the only one who lasted more than one film, apart from Jaws.<br>  My favourite though has to be Auric Goldfinger, just for sheer originality of the plan, bet not many people thought to try "Operation Grandslam".

She mounts the horse  unassisted, and the horse immediately springs into motion. It gallops along at  a steady and rhythmic pace, but the blonde begins to slide from the saddle.    In terror, she grabs for the horse's mane, but cannot seem to get a  firm grip. She tries to throw her arms around the horse's neck, but she slides  down the horse's side anyway The horse gallops along, seemingly impervious to  its slipping rider.   Finally, giving up her frail grip, the blonde  attempts to leap away from the horse and throw herself to safety.  Unfortunately, her foot has become entangled in the stirrup; she is now at the  mercy of the horse's pounding hooves as her head is struck against the ground  over and over.   As her head is battered against the ground, she is mere  moments away from unconsciousness when to her great fortune..... Frank, the  Walmart greeter, sees   her dilemma and unplugs the horse.

ScbEzhKiaa	because it has an almost demonic nature about it. imagine being stuck on a ship where something is in your head so to speak. it brings back the most horrible visions you could ever imagine or experience and makes you go through it again. In the movie, the ship, "Event Horizon" passes through a portal of sorts that the man-made black hole device created.

It comes back out this dimension after so long and the ship itself seems possessed. I thought it was one of the more original Horror flicks I've seen.|`|AA11707728	I find the fact that movie made money to be extremely scary.

Arrgh youve hit a nerve here lol and jonas brothers ................. who are they, sad little gay boys!!!|`|ea1ed505e3c0a89111a6fcd5e18dd1a8aa	But if you took all the questions off that people thought were irritating there would be none left. Everyone is irritated by a different question and as such, means everyones question is irritating to at least one.|`|uXbWtgnsaa	Jade Goody is a British Reality Star who is suffering from Cervical Cancer and only has a few weeks to live.|`|wnyuH0aTaa	I'm with you.<br>  <br>  What ever happened to people with talent or skill?|`|S5aXfRmPaa	People are making a big deal out of the Rihanna thing because she is a celebrity. She can also you her celebrity to raise awareness on abusive relationships. Plus he almost killed her!! That is a big deal!!<br>  The Jonas Brothers are not bastards. They can sing very well. They are some of the most amazing guys ever. I have no IDEA who Jade is.. WTF?<br>  Get on with your pathetic life and stop hating on celebrities you don't know!!!!<br>  <br>  p.s. Miley is not a slut!!! She is an amazing girl!!<br>  <br>  -Maya :)|`|eeKlogL4aa	We're all entitled to an opinion but there's no need to go on a rant about it. Although I agree with you on the Jonas Bastards (lol!),  I honestly don't give a damn if you're tired of the questions. I'm not asking them, what am I to do about it?<br>  I suggest you get off Yahoo! Answers if you don't like the questions.<br>  This rant will not change anything.|`|NQFV2AdZaa	I agree with renoir, you can't be sympathetic judging by your ranting. Don't answer the questions about these celebrities if they irritate you so much.|`|svYiQZUHaa	I just can't stand them either. They think they are all that. If you ask me the world would do better without them all But I do feel sorry for Jade Goody.|`|tUjCJIaTaa	haha Jonas Bastards.<br>  Good one.<br>  <br>  But yeh they are annoying.|`|zhQrY0kWaa	what a sad little person you are....|`|RQ7O1FnHaa	yuppp!!!|`|lnUrm4sGaa	mmm ok then|`|1c0f793db881cd47badc0d00bd5bd1caaa	Jade is dying of cancer, she has maybe a few weeks at best and she is 27 years old so maybe even an idiot might understand that people are interested, but judging by the whole misogynistic rant, which includes the priceless comment that she(Rihanna) ain't the first woman to be beat up, I don't suppose you are a very sympathetic individual.  Lets hope karma takes a holiday, eh!
yUInFtXyaa	Yes, that's what I'm thinking too. I think he was found but couldn't remember anything about his life, and so he was tricked into assuming the identity of Trent.|`|25HCZmPZaa	i think his taking time off so he take time in studying for his year 12 exams
AA11402617	"Road to Europe" is a favorite and so is "PTV", the one where Peter starts his own TV channel.  Here is a hilarious clip that the network decided was too raunchy and was cut from  the episode.

1o3OqSioaa	You don't really expect them to use their mugshot, do you? LOL<br>  Anyway's I'm sure your question was really rhetorical, but here goes anyway.<br>  Everyone want's to attract the opposite sex, and knows their best chance is to look their best, hoping that the person contacting them will take the time to get to know them, after being attracted to them. They know that a person is not going to give them the chance to show how wonderful they can be, if they are not attracted to them in the first place. So they fib a little, hoping for the chance to get someone to take the time to get to know the awesome person that they are on the inside. When that happens, the outside is not so noticeable, or important.|`|OPKbGXUFaa	Because I'm not going to post up 92803409 pictures of myself.<br>  I'm only going to pick the ones I like best.<br>  <br>  But yes, I hate that fish face, it's ugly.|`|R9zrDAkeaa	um bc you generally want to appear good looking<br>  i dunno but i think it may be brought on by possessing<br>  a healthy ego... but who knows...|`|0EaA6IACaa	hahah i put all pictures up...most of them i look like death but i think it's funny.|`|392052a3dbd6d94cc65100310f44fccfaa	For good impression.But it depends,if the pics have been airbrushed to make you look a certain way you're not,then no,there's no point to that.BUT,if the pics are the original ones of you,then,why not,it's YOU in them after all.|`|MuqtL8Baaa	they don't have much self-esteem and want attention because they feel like they don't have it at home, it's like they are a puppy who is in need of some cuddling.|`|AA10365008	lol.

bZud91iuaa	I have always looked for a quality bass player for the groups I have been in.  A good bass player, not someone who knows notes, brings it all home for me and the audience. The bass line is the bridge between what goes on in the lead lines and the drum line and holds everything together.  Like you said, a lot of groups don't look for a good bassist, just someone to fill the spot. I picked up the bass a couple of years ago for just the reasons I've stated...I was tired of mediocrity. Really havin' fun too.

ymH78A3zaa	start with the scale, just go up and down until you know it. then add hammer-ons and pull-offs, bends and slides and vibrato....<br>  for example <br>  E-----------------------------------<br>  B---------------------------------<br>  G---------------------------------<br>  D--------------------8-10~------<br>  A --------8h9h10---------------<br>  E 8h11---------------------------<br>  <br>  E-------------------------------------...<br>  B-------------------------------------...<br>  G----------------------------<br>  D-10b11r10-8-----8--------------------...<br>  A------------------10---10-9-8/6-8--6-...<br>  E-------------------------------------...<br>  start with something simple like that, remember that you don't have to stay in the same place the whole time, you can go up an octave and play the same thing.<br>  when in doubt I do like neil young "sample and hold" which is find something that sounds good and keep playing it!<br>  I almost forgot, you can also just borrow other peoples licks!<br>  Remember, Blues is all about feeling so just play whatever comes ot your head, Good luck!|`|2vzj65Kfaa	start with one note.<br>  <br>  Play that note.<br>  <br>  Play it, then let it breathe.  Play it again - vary the rhythm.  Listen to why that one note is cool - even over all of the chord changes.  Play the octaves of that one note.<br>  <br>  Then play two.  Pick that one note and any one of the other notes from the scale.  Play just those two (and their octaves) doesn't matter what order.  Play them, play one then another.  If you are playing piano or guitar, play them both together.<br>  <br>  Let there be space between them.  Play the space between the two.<br>  <br>  Then play the three.  etc.|`|SCXkBWk6aa	LOLLY!<br>  <br>  -Improvise<br>  -what are the rules<br>  <br>  THAT IS A CONTRADICION! THAT IS WHAT IMPROVISE IS ALL ABOUT!|`|958b3c9dfffbd359af24a34956241277aa	You don't have to stick to just 5 notes firstly.  Secondly, many players (of guitar) alternate back and forth between pent Major and pent minor.  Blues flute.  Sounds interesting.  I'm imagining it and it sounds good.  IMO, you can play blues on whatever instrument you want.<br>  <br>  Here's something I do when I play gutar or harp (harmonica).  I play along with a CD (you of course need to know the key of the song).  I'll play some of the same solo if I can But mainly I play a solo alonside the player on the CD, not playing over it but rather with it.  You have two intertwined solos going (like call and response) and I'm still learning.  I love music.|`|df1fd5c7d3d80fccad4e0bc0ec40e72baa	Feel the rhythm first. If it's a fast tempo, improv lively, but if it's something slow, keep it slow. Then get a feel for tonality. after you get these two together, play as you feel. But, also, there are occasions when it's a good idea to shut up a little. As in, play a bit, then shut up. then play more, and just follow that pattern|`|uije8eDraa	Just use those notes, play them like your making up a tune as you go along. <br>  <br>  <br>  Something like <br>  <br>  C C C Bb C Eb C<br>  <br>  C Bb C Bb C Eb F G<br>  <br>  G G G F G Bb G   C <br>  <br>  Etc. <br>  <br>  It's probably best if you end on the C note.|`|AA11826768	Try to remember the saddest moment of your young life. And how you felt. Like maybe you would just die. Now put that in your music. That is the rule. If you don,t feel it your audience wont.|`|uG7OZ5aTaa	Try the minor pentatonic scale (in any key). Lots of blues songs use that scale|`|QfTQnLNwaa	well i don't know what instrument are you playing, so i'll give you advice for the two most common:<br>  <br>  If you play piano C major blues is a nice one to start - important is to learn the chord changes for the left hand, get them smooth and then try to go up and down the blues scale with the right hand...variate the rhytm of what the right hand is playing - you'll find some bluesy sounding licks right away. To spice it up a little, try licking the adjacent   keys, that makes some kind of tone bending (very important in blues). And really variate the rhytm, dont play the same thing with both hands...<br>  <br>  If you play guitar, then learn to play in different key. C is no good for blues. Search the internet for blues scales (link in the sources) - there's a thing called a "box" which is basically a shape that is formed on the fretboard by the scale - the box stays the same wherever you play it. A good keys to start in is A, E, G... then again, run up and down the boxes and you'll find some licks...variate rhytm and you'll be ok...learn how to bend - it's easy, just be sure to always bend to another note - half, full or more...otherwise you'll sound out of key....<br>  <br>  apart to that it's all up to you.... btw the advice that the guy above (the top contributor) gave is also very nice for getting to know the notes and to play what you hear in your head...

It's really dumb to be like, most Virgos are most likely to be pale in complexion or are likely to have a certain eye color...WTF? Virgos of every ethnicity are born every August and September, and what they look like is not determined by astrology - it's called genetics.

I think it would be kind of obvious Western astrology is for the West.<br>  <br>  Just as other kinds of astrology are for other people and places. For example, Chinese astrology, or Celtic astrology...<br>  <br>  However... astrology cannot be racist by definition: a person with a prejudiced belief that one race is superior to others. Astrology is just a cultural thing, it's not racist.|`|03cLY4H8aa	Honestly i only become aware of astrology when new year comes, especially chinese new year. Astrologers and fengshui master are so busy foretelling predictions and reading everyone's future and destinies according to their zodiac signs and symbols. <br>  <br>  Sometimes i find it a bit  disconcerting when they tell that this and that person, country or company will be going to be this and that.<br>  <br>  I am not against astrology or to anyone who believes in it. Lets just be more realistic.|`|uRSUeFQ9aa	yes astrology is racist...............<br>  <br>  <br>  my god I cannot believe that okay if I seem rude than sue me.  That has got to be one of the most ignorant and flat out dumbest thing I've heard in a while, pertaining to astrology.  Those who don't live in the west......as if all people living in the east are starving.  There are more people in the east who are not starving, believe it or not, than those who are.  However, I will bare with you.<br>  <br>  Yes, in fact, each night dozens of people who live in india (or in a neighboring country) come on to answers and ask if something will happen to their "rahamashee ramasha" and such.  They are probably looking for magi astrologers, but they still come on here.  And ya know, alot of them are asking things like "will I find love soon" or "should I move now or wait".  Then there's europe and austrailia, lots of peeps from there are on here too.  <br>  <br>  So, it's not just the west.  And actually no there isn't any chart indication of "starving to death".  However there are indications of "bleak times" and given where you are born, that means different things.|`|ea1ed505e3c0a89111a6fcd5e18dd1a8aa	Travel could mean walking to a new area of land to sleep on. And love can be found by starving people....There are children in third world countries to prove this. Looking to change jobs is just saying there will be a change in your daily routine, this usually applies to work for most. I don't see how you can possibly say that astrology is racist.|`|bYbSVvR4aa	Okay i'm not going to say anything too extreme to either believe it all or dont.<br>  <br>  For me is those daily, monthly and yearly horoscope is just a rough guide for fun. Just ask yourself logically that how on earth can a person be able to predict everyday of your life?<br>  <br>  On other hand, I DO SERIOUSLY believe in HOROSCOPE'S PERSONALITY!<br>  Trust me, the description about the personality and character can be really really freaking true.<br>  You cant take my words until you have read them yourself, seriously.<br>  <br>  ps: if you dont find your horoscope suits your character, it could be due to your moon or rising sign.<br>  <br>  Best wishes. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Dont get me wrong, i am not trying to sell my belief for horoscope to anyone.

QxzR0VC8aa	never liked him in the first place.<br>  any man who lays even a finger on a woman deserves to be locked up. i cannot stand domestic violence and such-like.|`|LGkb4xibaa	my opinion is the same of him. He was ugly and a jerk before i knew it. He still is.|`|jfEOIeSIaa	he was never a sex symbol but now he's just an a$$hole who needs to be beat like she was, an eye for an eye.|`|TOls0c2haa	all you bitches were at some point attracted to chris brown dont deny it|`|dejqLjaLaa	To me, Chris Brown was never a sex symbol.|`|jlZZbdIjaa	I agree with SSK|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Nope he was always a kid to me...gangsta wannabe pop singer.|`|K4J6f1e0aa	The news has DEFINITELY changed my view on him. I mean, I used to think he was so cool and sexy but NOW it's like, "Wow....."<br>  I mean, I like his music still, but I mean, he never really seemed like the guy who would hit a girl, especially his girlfriend! That really gave him a bad image|`|rGMLz7iGaa	I don't think of him as a sex symbol. but I feel sad for him. He ruined his career and Rihanna. I'm so sorry that this had to happen. he was such a cool guy and she was such a cool girl. <br>  <br>  it's a sad deal.|`|AA10300538	i dont think he was ever a sex symbol.

I did find him attractive and fun before.  Even when this all happened, I wasn't trying to judge until it was resolved but when he admitted it thru his statements, I was disgusted and no matter what, don't think I would really change my view, even if he did get help.  I saw the pic recently released of what he did and couldn't believe it!|`|fp4SAJCTaa	da media have exaggerated the story, i have heard so much different story's, i even heard rihanna gave him herpes so i refuse to believe. chris brown is a lovely man, rihanna is a lovely lady . he is really hot!!!|`|qTuAgAy2aa	i never thought of him as a sex symbol. but i dislike him sooo much because even if he wasnt famous, he shouldnt have done this and should go to jail. Yeah, i didnt care about him before but now i just dont like him|`|B3cPFhssaa	For me he was never a sex symbol anyway.Guy deserves all he gets now after this though,total ***** for hitting a girl - i'd like to see how he comes off against a man.|`|sHL4wRMNaa	when was he a sex symbol, he is sooo unattractive and now even worse. he needs help and this changes a lot about how people will view him in the future. it's so sad|`|JmNaXTjqaa	i never thought he was a sex symbol i think hes gross, and from what im hearing in the press that makes me dislike even more x|`|iJXFZx7taa	Ew, honestly I never found him very attractive.<br>  He always seemed to be slightly retarded.|`|v811KD7raa	rihanna has|`|u2ZKtLY0aa	He's a wommmannn- BEATTTER. Always to my point of view.|`|uPI7QSoGaa	eugh...never was one in my opinion! But now my opinion of him is on the minus scale instead of just 0!|`|Pef0ZbLZaa	i never found him attractive.<br>  at all.<br>  most girls my age are still obsessed though.|`|FbwyvwEYaa	He's very attractive. But I've lost a lot of respect for him.|`|civjrSYIaa	Sex symbol my ****.....I'd like to see him smacked.

M8qLP7MLaa	No one has told him. He hasn't said anything to confirm it either, though it's been hinted that he knows. Since it's only been hinted, a lot of people conclude that he doesn't know.<br>  <br>  Example of hint:<br>  <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/238/16/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/238/16/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/238/17/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/238/17/</a>|`|PFWo8ZD9aa	nope.he doesn't know anything about the forth hokage a.k.a Minato Namikaze only that he had put the nine-tailed fox inside his body and had deceased after that.It's so sad though cause he doesn't even know who his father is. And to tell you one thing, the show, Naruto wouldn't end so soon yet. Cause he don't even know who Minato really is. So, if it's going to end, i think it will still be a long long way to go.|`|pARrxwZOaa	He doesn't know that the forth was his dad.  I don't know how he seen pictures i mean come on the look exactly alike(besides the whiskers).|`|hxoawGwZaa	No Naruto doesn't have a clue on who his dad is. besides, we never heard him talking about his parents or thinking about him.
WpqwaqcQaa	well sort of<br>  <br>  3d is getting more popular so they're making more sturdy versions but the paper ones are the most common and least expensive.<br>  <br>  just a hint for people that wear RX glasses you can get some plastic colored folders and cut them to fit your frames.|`|AA12381582	Red and blue, that is weird.   Those for theater use has not been used for a long time in theaters that I know of.  Polarized 3d glasses are what you are taking about, the tinted sunglasses type.  For theaters those have been used since 1950.  When I saw jaws 3d in 1983 at the theater they gave us polarized 3d glasses.  I don't know of any theater movie release using red and blue glasses.  Now  for television they use red and blue becuase they can't do polarized.   None of the 3d movie releases in theaters should be red and blue.

FZKFLTyLaa	In all honesty, the two points and a fair shot at ten more.
kFHwzBG7aa	Yes, but she's dating a total loser!  If only I could be that loser :) ...<br>  <br>  But yes, there are people who are meant to be alone forever... I think some people are destined to be alone, because they are meant to accomplish something great, and they couldn't do it otherwise.  And many of these people may achieve fame, or will be read about in history books, or even have something named after them, but for the price of being alone all their lives.<br>  <br>  Still other people, I suppose, may for whatever reason never meet that special someone, maybe because they're just unlucky, or maybe because they have a personality flaw that causes them to drive that person away when they do meet them.<br>  <br>  But these things you can't know, you can only guess.  Of course telling someone "don't worry, there is someone out there for you and you will find them" may be kind words but surely isn't advice because we KNOW that for everyone this isn't true.<br>  <br>  Many marriages have fallen apart, or are just plain rotten marriages, because one or both parties feel they are just "settling" for their mate, but really feel they deserve someone better.  I think it's very sad.|`|ohMBRQQdaa	yes there is darling|`|oc0pCUhyaa	i think definitely so. sometimes they speak a different language, live in a different country, are from completely different backgounds and you may never meet them in you entire life. but yep they're definitely out there. <br>  sometimes we get married with our best friends. and thats nice but some guy in koreas that you will never ever see has the real solution to your equation haha|`|WaJU9TTpaa	i sure hope there is someone out there.|`|2040myy2aa	we all have a group of people that we can be with it's not just one person|`|Ry4Jc96Aaa	i'd like to think so|`|392052a3dbd6d94cc65100310f44fccfaa	No,not really.There's no such thing.Some choose to be alone,some are better off alone...So,no,that's not a rule.|`|JctGBbPdaa	well..after what happened to me today,I don't so..<br>  or maybe I could be wrong...huuuhh... ;(|`|I7Cs8hu1aa	some losers are just destined to be alone.... don't worry, chances are slim that you are one of them.|`|Bj8abBLGaa	Maybe. In some cases their can be more than once person that person is meant for.|`|MXQKzRPiaa	Well, I have my hubby. =D<br>  He is in bed at the moment... waiting on me to come, lol! (-:<br>  x|`|PXIoiNSvaa	We're social creatures, no one is meant to be alone.|`|rfxSQbwuaa	i really try not to think about it i really tell u u looking very sweet yaar|`|YTxORHkUaa	I bet there is, but some people just might not find them. Or if they do, they lose that chance of being with them.|`|uEIOgxWlaa	I would hope so, I mean God didn't just create us for us to not find that significant other.|`|AIUZYCHyaa	In theory there is. You have to patient.|`|O1wc4pM3aa	There is someone for everyone, only this someone, most of the times is with someone else !  :(((<br>  <br>  To be serious, yes, there is if our heart, mind and soul are open to receive the person with all their plus and minus.|`|f3QeLCZUaa	Yes. he is the wire -puller of everyone.That is God. without  his help<br>  we cant move or do anything|`|Dl1uS5CLaa	yes. there is. keep your head up|`|3sM4PS3yaa	I think there's someone for everyone, but you just need to make an effort to find them.|`|2Es3qSdxaa	I know a btch here who destroys peoples heart by keyword love, i know that btch|`|kQpzMLN7aa	Only if your name starts with an M and ends with a "inski".|`|1133b5d38a3d30a09c2b1c70499eaaf9aa	only God knows that since I have no idea|`|nmcZDMucaa	yes lol|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Idk, I really try not to think about it.|`|lwJF5DhHaa	yes there is|`|xgF6W3E6aa	I do not believe in the theory of someone for every one or soul mates, any of that stuff. I believe we are with who we choose to be with, or not be with.|`|UjPArJZ6aa	Some are destined to be alone forever...ohhh well, there's always the bourbon.|`|tIJCQ0XQaa	There's someone for everyone, we just have to find each other. =)|`|OOL4XdjPaa	theres someone for everyone.. <br>  <br>  it just takes a while to find them.|`|36PrVK7Oaa	The lonliest people tend to be the most rejecting people.

EufwiT3qaa	well there are rumors Katherine Heigl and T.R. Night are leaving the show. I think this sickness thing for Izzy will be how Katherine leaves the show|`|uZqx04Fzaa	she might.. but they are both leaving the show.. it's confirmed in magazines and on official websites.. <br>  <br>  she probably will just run off with george and they don't come back (i personally hate the show because i hate that it portrays doctors and interns as sluts and is not medically correct.. at all!!!)|`|VAp5ICaBaa	I read that her and George are both leaving the show so it is very well possible which totally sucks
i8vpe2g7aa	I don't know because I've never seen him act before. I suppose that will change when Phantasmagoria comes out. I do think he would have been pretty cool in that role but I'd have to see him act before saying that he could have been better than Depp, although I'm pretty sure he would have done a good job and portrayed the character very interestingly.|`|1c74cc7ee9876780e94d288d920e0d0aaa	No, the guys a creep|`|IARPr7k5aa	no way, manson can't act!

u2EUom6daa	i have seen on different web sites different dates of when supernatural is back on and i seen an interview with Eric Kripke about the episode Jump the Shark and it said this episode airs April 23, and i also found an episode guide and worked out there air dates from the Jump The Shark episode and i worked out that supernatural wont be back on till March 26? so maybe this is wrong i will have another look :)<br>  <br>  Episode 4.15 - “Death Takes a Holiday” March 26<br>  Episode 4.16 - “On The Head Of A Pin“ Airs April 2<br>  Episode 4.17 - “It’s a Terrible Life“ airs April 9<br>  Episode 4.18 - “The Monster At The End Of This Book” airs april 16<br>  Episode 4.19 - "Jump the Shark" episode airs on April 23<br>  <br>  on the web site Supernatural TV it says supernatural is back on march 12<br>  definitly March 12 just been on CW web site and there is a great trailer for supernatural here is the link so you can see it :)<br>  <a href="http://cwtv.com/shows/supernatural" rel="nofollow">http://cwtv.com/shows/supernatural</a>|`|C4XDQRilaa	Yeah Smallville's coming back then too - but why are all these shows being pushed back? What's happening with the CW?|`|lxrQyQ5raa	Supernatural was originally going to come back with new shows on March 5th but they jumped it a week ahead to March 12th because they didn't want to put new shows on and have to compete with American Idol.  I read this in Supernatural Magazine so it is a FACT.  So don't be sad.  Season 4 isn't over yet.  The next show is going to be call Jump The Shark and Dean and Sam are going to find out that they have a half brother.  It should be interesting to see what this brother is. If it is actually a half brother or if it's a demon pretending to be.  Who knows.  Something to look forward to.  So CHEER UP.  It will be back soon!!!!!!  LOL.|`|VZacbgAmaa	idk
MMmv06Ynaa	i dunno, but I want him to come back too! It was so sad when he left.
PeuFnqQwaa	Get some picks, a chromatic guitar tuner (Korg or Boss) a guitar strap and an instrument cable. As for an amp. If you are buying a cheapy, Pretty much anything will do. When/If you want to spend more money, I would look for a good Tube amp (Marshall, Blackheart, Vox, Mesa). A good amp makes a big difference in your overall sound. But I would not be too concerned with this yet if you are just learning.|`|AA10279595	You WILL need a tuner. A cable or two, undeniably. <br>  An amp for under 60 dollars will be a toughie..<br>  There really isn't a list, but amps are kinda expensive. Maybe a local pawn shop? But always, always, always, play any equipment that you are going to buy.|`|Eok0fu7Laa	well i play guitar and mine was a pretty good deal. mine is an Ibanez 10 wat amp. you can also get the amps in larger wat sizes, but if your a beginer i would suggest a 5 or 10 wat. hope that helps!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine?!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgewKsAezYbkYxhuAZqFy7_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220171337AAa7Yie">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|xEBNAlksaa	I play guitar... somewhat.. lol.. but my brother buys all my stuff. I currently have a Epiphone SG standard, and I use a spider amp.. It wasnt very expensive but it sounds great. If you want ur guitar to sound better my advice would be to get an effects pedal. To make it easy try going to www.musicianfriends.com they have some great stuff. Or guitar center always has wonderful stuff. For good prices. The little music shops tend to run for alot more money. Depending on where you live try Guitar Center.. <br>  <br>  Good Luck

H2qEN27daa	I have been watching Conan for over 10 years and its very sad to see him go. I know he's going to the Tonight Show but its still not going to be the same, not without Max etc. I'm still gonna watch the show but I'll def. miss Conan. I thought it was sweet how he was tearing up =*)<br>  <br>  I got to go to a taping on my 21st Bday, and I was front row. Conan came out before the show started and hugged me cause it was my bday and then gave me a bag of tea lol. And I happened to be sick that day so it turned out to be a thoughtful present ahah :)<br>  <br>  <br>  **i remember andy's last show and Conan was def. crying and not just holding back tears and then i started crying.. lol.. this show is amazing and as much as i love Conan it just wont be the same without everyone/everything i wish they just got rid of the tonight show and moved Conan's show up to the 11;35pm slot. OH and the band isn't coming! Max wont (or cant) sell his house in NJ so they arent going =***(|`|ItjUfDplaa	I'm so sad that it's over =(<br>  <br>  I've watched it for years, almost every night I watched Conan. I'm glad he's still going to be on, but I'm worried that it just won't be the same as Late Night. He just isn't the LA type. LA is just so ... fake, and Conan isn't fake. He's a New Yorker! And I will miss that blue curtain thing of the famous NYC skyline at night =(<br>  <br>  I can't believe that NBC is going to have 4 late night TV shows. Leno, Conan, Fallon and then Carson ... IMO, they should boot Carson. He isn't even funny.|`|q6uyloYdaa	I've been watching his show for 10 years. I still have a bunch of old episodes on tape. I still have Andy's last episode on tape. I'm sure his material will be similar on the Tonight Show, but it won't be the same. I'll miss Late Night ): especially since I will not be giving Jimmy Fallon a second of my time to watch.|`|6In638rbaa	I was bummed when I found that out. He's such a New Yorker he doesn't belong in Los Angeles. It won't be the same. I hope Californians get his kind of humor.<br>  <br>  Do you know if the band will join him? <br>  It won't be complete without them.|`|d2RV8HTmaa	I agree.  I hate that I missed his farewell show tonight, but it's just as well because I probably would have boo-hooed.  Conan has had a terrific run on Late Night and I have been watching his show for years.  He's such a hilarious as well as sensitive and intelligent person.  I think his fans will stay with him for the Tonight Show and maybe he will even pick up some more.  I know I will be tuning in.  Conan has never failed to deliver and I think he will be amazing.  I wish him all the luck in the world.|`|AA12343006	Yes we're all happy Conan will still be on air for the Tonight Show, but dammit I'm going to really miss Late Night with him. Things are going to change no matter what. I'm just excited to see that change! And he is a hilarious man no matter what.<br>  <br>  A plus for me is that I'll be in bed earlier now haha :)
fHgbL046aa	I heard her and George are leaving.  I don't watch the show anymore, but I know Katherine wants to start a family because she recently got married. She doesn't wanna be an actress and a mom. Not sure what George is gonna do. Sometimes its not about the money, and I totally understand you don't want the cool characters to leave or be killed of. I hate that too.|`|d44fc27463b696529be1b984d7af0fabaa	I don't really mind so much. Her character was loveable the first 2 seasons but after that she became too winey and annoying. <br>  <br>  After all - its just a fiction show. It doesn't really matter.|`|AJa4MjGPaa	i love all the cast of grey's anatomy ......i love izzy and katherine heigl....if will  leave katherine(or anyone else of the cast) from grey's anatomy then grey's .. ... will lose the interest!!!!!!!but i will continue wacthing this tv show ...........................................

uD1S5dYtaa	And don't you wish there was some magic that can make it so that if you can't spell "psychic" you are automatically unable to ever ask another question again.  And it sticks!|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	This section is the dumping ground for much riff raff: psychic dependency, stupid quiz over load, cut-n-paste experts, and random immaturity. The only place on Yahoo people who want to REALLY learn about horoscopes or astrology is in a YA Group. <br>  <br>  Just more of the same, sadly. YA needs to police this place better.<br>  <br>  **nice..the riff raff went away...there really IS magic...lol**|`|cLgwmcfwaa	people who are HIGHLY skilled in astrology seem like psychics?<br>  idk. you're right about this. i wanna kno too lol|`|lpyWVR2oaa	Some people mistakenly just dump horoscopes and astrology into the same category as 'the occult/witchcraft/fortune-telling/voodoo... I guess 'psychics' would fall under the latter category...<br>  <br>  One link I find between the two is the Water Sun + Water Moon combination - they're truly blessed with psychic and intuitive powers, to say the very least. They're probably the ones people are hoping that would answer the 'psychic' questions

But at the end of the day, it comes down to the Y!A community, yes the people inside this community. The everyday normal people, they are what makes it suck. There are so many people that don't follow the objectives of it properly, do things that upset other people and generally just make it a sucky environment. Yes Yahoo! should manage it much better but at the end of the day they can only prevent it, they didn't cause it to suck...We did, all of us.|`|ECPG0EDcaa	It sucks because the people with the real answers and knowledge also have real lives and don't spend their days trolling around Yahoo! Answers.  I have asked several questions but have given up, because the answers are too brief, too full of opinions instead of facts, and usually written by people who clearly have no brains in their heads.  If you make the mistakes of asking a nuanced question, be prepared for a one-word answer that makes no sense.  Here's an example:<br>  <br>  Q:  I've been accepted to Harvard and Yale.  I want to have a career in international diplomacy.  Which school should I attend?<br>  <br>  A:  (Picked by users.)  go to uc it rocks hard woooo go bearcats|`|Rs5QTZ85aa	yahoo answers doesn't suck, (though it could do with a few adjustments)<br>  <br>  it's the really annoying people who go on YA that suck, like the people who are really anal about swearing, and giving thumb-downs for no reason.<br>  <br>  THEY PISS ME OFF!!!|`|ib17ciJQaa	becuz i cant fart on it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  HA<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  XOXO<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  CATNIP!|`|d3A83djHaa	Because they don't review reported answers they just delete them.

I can listen to pop music, but the singer has to be able to SING! and taylors voice is horrible!|`|rRCTvT7Saa	I can honestly say that I'm not a fan of Taylor Swift.  However, she's got to be doing something right with how many albums she's selling!  I don't like her music though and, in all truth, she should be considered pop--not country.  She's not even country by today's standards!|`|3rt8oKIzaa	I love Taylor Swift!

Dennis/Eldona  <br>  <br>  Demi Moore ... Diane Lightson<br>  <br>  A financier [Chevy Chase] meets a spurned lover [Demi Moore] and agrees to take her to a business meeting. On the way there, they run a stop sign in a tiny town in the middle of nowhere. They are arrested and taken to the local court. But all is not as it seems: the courthouse and the "prison" are a maze of zany booby- traps and deadly contraptions. The antics of the captured couple as they try to escape from the mad judge and his bizarre family make up the rest of this unusual film.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.impawards.com/1991/posters/nothing_but_trouble.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.impawards.com/1991/posters/no...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi2293104921/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi2...</a>|`|TDfOl6kdaa	Sounds an awful lot like Nothing But Trouble with Demi Moore, Chevy Chase, and John Candy.

G or PG you can just go.  If it's R, ask your folks or an adult you trust to take you.  If it's X or NC-17, forget it until you're 18.  This is the legal way to do it.  If you want to do it some other way, you're on your own.|`|uZDe2eM3aa	umm well when i searched it, it is only PG rated so i'm pretty sure its suitable, but its about cheerleaders, so you decide whether or not its something you would like to see|`|tQ4QlE8Waa	Go to Yahoo Movies and check out the rating|`|SafgXJ2xaa	Ok yes and yes!<br>  Im 13 too and that movie looks freakin hillarious!<br>  Also I'm a girl but my boyfriend wants to see it too!<br>  I think it should be really good and you should have a good time!<br>  Have fun!|`|WLOYYZp3aa	if you wanna see it, then see it. it looks funny :D
xqrwDmyUaa	This is from imdb.<br>  <br>  "The specific crimes shown in Fargo didn't happen, but the plot has elements of two well-known Minnesota crimes. In 1962, a St. Paul attorney named Eugene Thompson hired someone to kill his wife, Carol. Unbeknownst to Thompson, his man hired someone else to do the job. The second man fatally wounded Mrs. Thomspon in her house, but she managed to escape him. She went to a neighbor's house for help while her assailant fled the scene. The sloppiness and brutality of the crime attracted great attention. The murderers were quickly caught and gave up Thompson, who denied knowing anything about the crime for many years afterward. In 1972, Virginia Piper, the wife of a wealthy Orono banker, was kidnapped. A million-dollar ransom was paid, one of the largest in U.S. history. Mrs. Piper was found tied to a tree in a state park. Two men were convicted of the crime, but were acquitted after a re-trial. One of them later went on a shooting spree after his wife left him, killing her, their 5-year-old son, her son from a previous marriage, her new boyfriend, and one of his sons. Only $4,000 of the money was ever recovered."<br>  <br>  Other than that, which is hardly anything to base a film on, the movie is fiction. So its certainly not accurate to anything lol. It actually says it's all fiction in the end credits. The "Based on a True Story" at the beginning was basically a lie. <br>  <br>  You can find all this info on imdb.com<br>  <br>  Be careful with wiki, as it's created and updated by used a lot of the info is completely false.|`|l0Ye97Hjaa	I'm pretty sure it's about 95% fictionalized.<br>  It was based on the case of a man who murdered his wife and disposed of her body through a wood chipper.<br>  I read it on wikipedia.

vVTmJjJDaa	netflix is definitely the better of the two - <br>  <br>  i agree with you, i don't like going to blockbuster to exchange movies either.  so, that's not a bonus in their favor...<br>  <br>  yet, netflix offers a certain number of *free* *online* hours of moving watching per month (depending on which plan you sign up for - btw, it's 2 hours if you sign up for 1 dvd at a time, but it's unlimited for all of the other plans!), which is a definite bonus - blockbuster offers this as well, but their free online movie selection is LAME by comparison.<br>  <br>  also, netflix does also have promo codes to extend your 2 week free trial to a month - i've had to google that (in-depth!)each time, but i've been successful each time.<br>  <br>  i just wanted to add that one time i lost a dvd - when i called netflix up and told them, they just said "no problem"(!) - and didn't charge me a dime for it! - i can't guarantee that this would be the case in general - and, i was a member for quite a while when it happened - still, it's nice to know that they can be quite understanding. :)|`|IizPFrELaa	I prefer netflix, that what I use|`|z6qIZRFFaa	netflix rocks!!!!!!! Unlimited movies and instant play on your computer!!|`|f5821d0eb9486d7586aa71ba68cdecc8aa	I use Blockbuster and I enjoy it.  I go to the Blockbuster store too though, so trading in movies is a plus for me.  Blockbuster also allows you to download and watch movies on your computer.<br>  <br>  You've tried them both, go with the one you like best.

Qb61FHANaa	If its always been a dream of yours, I would go for it! Weigh out the advantages and disadvantages, can you stay where you are now and still go to broadcasting school, if so I would pursue it.|`|06lOUmwWaa	Hello <br>  I am an alumni from CSB as well as an administrator at one of the school's 26 campuses nationwide. I also have worked for CBS Radio for 4 years while juggling online radio and my own music studio. <br>  I am not sure if there is a certain aspect of broadcasting that you are interested in but attending CSB can and will help if you are willing to put the work in. You have 26 campuses to network with for your whole life  once you complete the first Phase of the program. <br>  There is no reason why someone who has gone thru the program at CSB can not make a career for themselves in this business, you just have to work hard, take advantage of your resources and network, network, network. <br>  I hope this post helps and I would be happy to provide you with any further information if you would like. Feel free to e-mail me.

240e85ac1f26271b71217ebbf8ba3a79aa	List 2.<br>  <br>  It has more of a classic rock feel, as well as, my favourite classic rock bands (AC/DC, Queen, Aerosmith) while still maintaining my favourite mainstream rock (Linkin Park, Led Zeppelin, Fort Minor-> not rock but Mike Shinoda is awesome).<br>  <br>  But I would have to say that The rest of the bands on list 2 are pretty crappy.. it would be great if System of a Down were on list 2, same with MCR.|`|QFrPpfr0aa	I love both lists of bands.<br>  :) I love exactly ALL types of music.<br>  I think number 1 would be good for me seeing that there are alot of my top fav. bands there.<br>  <br>  <3|`|Ry4Jc96Aaa	1, two and some older bands which aren't my thing. but i'd take out korn from list 1|`|KTU1oa9Gaa	they both have some sucky artists...but i am gonna say number 1|`|ZveMIJxLaa	1 most likely.

BYUGkoHoaa	With television series, like books, you have to really wait a few episodes in to really get the show and for it to pick up.<br>  <br>  While although I love Joss adn all his works, and had anticipated Dollhouse for a very long time, for me it fell a bit flat and was not as great as I expected.I'm going to continue watching because I do like the show and the idea, I just hope it becomes more Joss like.Even though it is a slow start, I do expect for it to  become increasingly better.i just hope fox doesn't cancel it before it hits its stride.|`|v7Y9cFW8aa	Yeah i thought it was alright. I did expect it to be better though. I'm a huge fan of Joss Whedon and I know that his shows usually take some patience before they become totally awesome.

A03NJA26aa	Yeah I like it too. I went through an ER phase where that was all I wanted to watch. I got hooked on it over a few summers watching repeats on TNT. I am in love with Carter. I miss all the old cast though. I like Abby and Luka too. Carol and Doug were cute too. I miss Mark Greene and Lucy Knight. Hopefully all those characters who can come back will before it ends. I hope Carter is o.k. That last scene has me worried.

AKv1gj0Xaa	Starting a magazine these days is as easy as it's ever been... keeping one going is probably harder than it's ever been.<br>  <br>  You need a solid concept, great photography and writing, a place to get the pages designed and printed, and enough advertising to support your endeavors. There is a lot of overhead involved with printing on paper -- although the cost for color has become more affordable -- and for mail distribution, thanks to the cost of postage. You could bypass a lot of this by producing an e-zine, with distribution over the Internet or via e-mail.<br>  <br>  Many community colleges offer classes in publication design and journalism. That's a good place to learn some basics. It might also be helpful to you to job shadow with someone locally who runs their own publication so you can learn about the business considerations that go into publishing. Also check out the art and graphic design section of most large bookstores, which will have good books on this subject.

uRSUeFQ9aa	Having a cancer moon in the 8th house means that your finances may fluctuate and change as often as the moon itself.  If there are negative aspects to the moon then your partners may likely be moody individuals who aren't the most well-off financially.  You might inherit from your mom.  Also, this type of placement indicates "the consultant"; one who fixes what others break.  You might even go into a career that specifically deals with reorganizing things.  Also philanthropy might be one of your strengths.  However you do with work, much is based on your emotions, which are deep.  You have good intuition (especially if the moon is well-aspected) and like to nurture others.  You are moody, and on the whole, prefer to sidestep emotional confrontations.<br>  <br>  Sagittarius moon in the 5th house is one who loves to have fun!  This person would be free-loving with a knack for travel.  They also might love animals, particularly large animals.  This type of placement is indicative of having many children.  Also, they need their space quite a bit, and if anyone expects them to "settle down" then they are kidding themselves.  A sag moon typically never settles down happily.  They would be romantic and ardent in love, possibly getting along well with women (unless the moon is afflicted).  Public success is likely, and this person has an instintual teaching habit; they love to show others what to do and how to do it.|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Yeah, pray and ask the person you pray to, for the answer.  Otherwise, I don't know.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Moon in 8th House: <br>  Eighth house<br>  The Moon in the eighth house projects its influence by emphasizing the feeling that security is of the utmost importance. You have a saving instinct for the future, almost to the extent of self-denial. You have a strong sense of duty and obligation to others. It is not unlikely that you might become a part of some movement or cause dedicated to the improvement or uplifting of people en masse. You are very sensitive to social currents and social demands. In some instances, this position may indicate one who can or does manipulate money from others. Often it signifies the likelihood of inheriting money. <br>  <br>  Moon in 5th House:<br>  Fifth house<br>  The Moon in the fifth house makes you emotionally in touch with your personal creativity. This placement often produces an individual who is very impressionable, so you may need to be rather cautious regarding advice you receive on investments and risk-taking. The concept of security is very strong in your nature and you are particularly slow to let your children go out on their own and become independent. Your attachment to your children tends to be very much emotionally based. There is also apt to be a lot of emotions involved in your romantic relationships, so you may find it hard to break off bad relationships.|`|HHhzZG7maa	WHEN THE MOOOOON IS IN THE SEVENTH HOOOUSE<br>  AND JUUUPITTTEEEER ALIGNS WITH MAAARS THEN PEEEEACE WILL RUUUULE THE PLANETS<br>  AND LOOOO OOOOVE WILL STEER THE STARS<br>  THIS IS THE DAWNING OF THE AGE OF AQUARIUS<br>  THE AGE OF AQUARIUUUUUUUS<br>  <br>  <br>  YAY!YAY!YAY!YAY!YAY!
GlHHz1ehaa	Lol. Maggie Gyllenhaal is so ugly it kills me to see that she played a somewhat big role in the film. <br>  <br>  I am in love with The Dark Knight. <br>  My favorite part would have to be the hospital explosion. Before the Joker blows it up as he is walking out of Harvey's hospital room, he squirts out some hand sanitizer. I think thats pretty funny. Also the way he wobble's out of the hospital wearing his skirt is just hilarious and evil at the same time. <br>  <br>  The Dark Knight was a masterpiece and I honestly, loved the entire film.|`|I8iFm8Qkaa	My favorite part was when Batman is beating the crap out of the joker, and he just took it =] priceless!!!|`|FF9mMlgKaa	I hated the Dark Night.

gWu693giaa	Comedy-Hamlet 2 is hilarious. It's not about Hamlet at all but is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen.<br>  <br>  Action-Grindhouse is amazing. It's two movies in one,Planet Terror and Deathproof. Planet Terror is first and its a zombie,shoot em up movie that is incredible. Deathproof is Tarantino at his best. Highly Recommended.<br>  <br>  Drama-I'm a sucker for Million Dollar Baby. That movie just sucks me in every time i watch it. A classic.<br>  <br>  Horror-House of 1,000 corpses is the perfect horror movie but its not for everybody. If you do like it though The Devils Rejects will blow your mind. Great stuff.|`|r8rykCkGaa	How about, "Run Baby Run" or "The Cross and the Switchblade," etc.  There is a good movie which came out lately about the years of Billy Graham, but don't remember the title.

QhXL4Lilaa	Well it depends on what you're doing... however I will choose the second one (letter b) because it's simple and catchy, and I love that song and I can't wait for you to show "me" your sample lol|`|pR0pJNJkaa	It really depends on what your sampling...like are you sampling a piece or the entire beat. I think the Tony Rich thing would only work unless you are doing an RIP cut...You could have more variety with the Case song, but don't do it straight up cause that's been done before.|`|LqQvCvLAaa	Case man<br>  that song off the hook|`|OZjlW5utaa	a is good but b has more depth, so b.|`|OGNBOaKyaa	Case!!<br>  Omg...i forgot all about that song! Sample case...|`|XxgNEIeuaa	a.|`|xmdh8iY3aa	I don't think either are really sampling songs. Nobody Knows is an accoustic song with alot of vocals. Missing You has a simple hip hop drum beat with a rolling bassline....it does sound dope though.<br>  <br>  If I had to choose I'd go with b.|`|NctYwdvhaa	b because you might have it easier on giving your rap track a certain sound or melody.

aOUjMhUmaa	Have you seen that movie, "He's just not that into you."<br>  <br>  If he doesn't forgive you, he likely is just a paranoid or untrusting person. He's probably had a lot of people betray him, and the fear of letting that happen again are too much for him.<br>  Honestly, it isn't going to matter if you could prove it to him 100%. A person either trusts you or they don't. If they don't trust you, but they love you, they'll want to work on the trust thing and whatnot, but in this situation, it seems you're on the outside looking in and he's not ready to let you in.|`|ak610Npjaa	i am a taurus and i am very forgiving also but it does take a little while longer for me to forgive someone i love when they do something i thought they never would. if you betrayed him or broke his trust in any kind of way either prove you didn't or move on. We are really big on trust. other than that just be really sweet to him and show him you love him and he will come around hes just being stubborn and whatever you do dnt give him more than 2 days worth of space bc he will feel you dnt care anymore<br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|x8dDKH3Maa	I would guess it's taking him longer to forgive you because he cares about you more than the average "Joe" that ruined his party. If you've been together for 3.5 years and have alot of relationship baggage he may just be feeling like it's time to move on. And Taureans are said to be stubborn so...|`|C2UNiVKCaa	its perhaps cuz he didn't expect what-you-did/didn't do from you..You must have been special to him and he must have had strong expectations from u..Believe me if this person is so forgiving..It wud have been really hard for him to even think that u cud hav done such a thing..|`|ZXH4jBiraa	If he's an aries, he would have forgiven you long time ago. Aries melt at the slightest love you give them. So, show him your love through your actions and he will see your better side.

XwxiuXY0aa	Well it depends on which comes to you first.<br>  <br>  I personally like to make the music before the words.<br>  <br>  hope this helps =]|`|uJhW7o5Caa	I am in a band, so I have to think about this a lot. Personally I like writing a riff then taking lyrics and attempting to match it to the riff although most people write the lyrics first|`|XltI6Bupaa	I do both as well =] It definitely depends on the song and the mood of the particular lyrics<br>  Hope this helps :)|`|DQusetDNaa	Sometimes I write a riff and then I write lyrics to match it, but then sometimes I happen to write a new riff that goes even better with those same lyrics, and then I might write new lyrics that go well with the old riff.....<br>  So basically I write as much as I can of both, and try to fit the pieces together as best as I can.

He says he feels fine so the doctor turns it up to 50%. still the husband is feeling good.

The doctor told the husband that they couldn't graft any skin from her body because she was too skinny.  So the husband offered to donate some of his own skin. However, the only skin on his body that the doctor felt was suitable would have to come from his buttocks.<br>  <br>  The husband and wife agreed that they would tell no one about where the skin came from, and requested that the doctor also honor their secret. After all, this was a very delicate matter.<br>  <br>  After the surgery was completed, everyone was astounded at the woman's new beauty.  She looked more beautiful than she ever had before! All her friends and relatives just went on and on about her youthful beauty!<br>  <br>  One day, she was alone with her husband, and she was overcome with emotion at his sacrifice.<br>  <br>  She said, "Dear, I just want to thank you for everything you did for me.   There is no way I could ever repay you."<br>  <br>  "My darling," he replied, "think nothing of it.  I get all the thanks I need every time I see your mother kiss you on the cheek."|`|0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	Alright, I've been itching to get this one out.<br>  <br>  A poor farmer went to town because he needed animals--to lay eggs and pull his little plow.  He found somebody selling chickens and bought a young hen and a rooster.  Then he found someone selling a donkey, and that looked to be just right since he didn't need anything as big as a horse or a mule.  He was told, "He gets stubborn like they do, but scratch him on his head between his ears and he'll come right along."  So the farmer set off for home with his animals, and along the road the donkey stopped.  There he was with a rooster under one arm, a hen under the other and the rope to the mule looped through his fingers.  But a woman came down the road so he asked her for help.  "Would you hold my ￠o￠k and pullet while I scratch my a§§?<br>  <br>  The one about the tattoo parlor is a variation on one I heard before.  A woman walked into a tattoo parlor and wanted her favorite movie stars tattooed on the insides of her thighs.  She wanted Robert Redford on one side and Clint Eastwood on the other.  When he was done, she wanted to know if someone could really tell who they were, so the tattoo artist went outside and fetched a wino.  "Here's ten bucks.  Now, remember: the one on the right is Robert Redford and the one on the left is Clint Eastwood."<br>  <br>  So they went inside and the woman spread her legs, asking, "Can you tell who these guys are?" <br>  <br>  "Heck, yeah!" says the wino.  "That one there is Robert Redford.  That guy on the other side is Clint Eastwood.  And that hairy stinky wrinkly one in between 'em is Willie Nelson!"<br>  ___________________________________<br>  Good list, Kevin.

"Very good", replied the teacher. The next week the same thing happens. "Mary, who loves us and is with us where ever we go?" Johny sticks her with the pin. "God Almighty!!!" she exclaims. The third week the teacher calls on Mary and says, "Mary, what did Eve say to Adam after she had her last child?" Thinking he comes to the rescue Johny sticks Mary with the pin.

Talib Kweli doesn't have any wack songs. And on Black Star, Talib outshined Mos Def on most of the songs in my opinion. So, I'm gonna say Talib Kweli but not by a lot. Just barely. Both of their styles are very similar and I can't think of anybody else these MC's could compare to. All of Talib's album are nice, all of Mos Def's albums are nice. All of Talib's lyrics are dope, all of Mos Def's lyrics are dope. They are both respected by the same community of hip hop fans for the same reasons. So, it's a toss up. But, since you asked me to choose, I'm gonna say Talib Kweli. But, like I said, he gets the edge barely.|`|NctYwdvhaa	Talib Kweli for Quality but Mos Def for Black On Both Sides. id say there are both fairly equal in skill. you only have to listen to mathematics to see Mos Def's lyricism, and Kweli raps very well aswell. im going with Kweli on this one though, his songs seem more lively, diverse and lyrical.|`|os6FaEBlaa	Kweli|`|UX2dqQQVaa	Talib Kweli.......<br>  <br>  I like Mos Def but I think Talib Kweli got him beat on lyrics.

gRkpFHNzaa	Was raised on classic country. Some of my favorites are Mel Tillis, Kenny Rogers, Cal Smith,Patsy Cline. All are great artists. It's a shame we are made to listen to what Nashville considers country today.|`|yJCdLNHwaa	Classic Country Rocks.<br>  <br>  Mine would be Charlie Daniels. My fave of his is Still In Saigon. I like it because I have an uncle that was stationed in Vietnam.<br>  <br>  Also there are a lot of songs that do not get enough time in the limelight.<br>  <br>  The Green Berets<br>  <br>  Eddie Arnold:<br>  The Tennessee Stud<br>  <br>  Mac Wiseman:<br>  Jimmy Brown<br>  The Prisoner Song<br>  Don't Make Me Go To Bed And I'll Be Good<br>  I Still Write Your Name In The Sand<br>  Wabash Cannonball<br>  The Waltz You Saved For Me<br>  Mama Put My Little Shoes Away<br>  Your Best Friend And Me<br>  Sweeter Than The Flowers<br>  18 Wheels A Humming Home Sweet home<br>  <br>  Three Sheets To The Wind- George Jones<br>  Fox On The Run- Tom T.

I love all of the old stuff. In fact I'm watching a show on RFD TV with people singing "Apartment #9" Tammy Wynett's daughter sang it. <br>  My favorite is Charlie Pride.

Too many favorites to pick just one.|`|0G9NKgItaa	yes|`|owJgouyjaa	i have to say mine would be johnny horton|`|gS651gq8aa	i like the old country songs that tell stories...<br>  i kinda like johnny cash|`|AA12316366	sure do. hank williams, kitty wells, roy acuff, ernest tubb, porter waggoner, grandpa jones, sons of the pioneers, i could go forever|`|7adb1ec924a232bd76f142d1a8a85b1baa	Waylon was great.<br>  <br>  I was named after his song Amanda.

That goodness for XM 10 and 13 for the "Traditional-Classic" country music.<br>   Favorites include;<br>  .....Johnny Horton,Jim Reeves , Hank Thompson , Marty Robbins , Billy Walker , Jimmy Dean , Bobby Bare , Waylon , Willie , Cal Smith , Wanda Jackson , Connie Smith , Donna Fargo , Tanya Tucker ,Loretta, Dolly.............<br>  ... Watch it the newbie trolls burn ya , they think classic country was recorded last week~!<br>   I have to say Classic country all the way.|`|273f2433b1dffeaf31f3be0b1db943e9aa	Waylon Jennings is my all time favorite.  I don't even have to think twice on that one...lol  Not a day goes by that I don't listen to at least one song by him.  I have a great fondness for Willie also and when you put the two together with Kris Kristofferson and Johnny Cash,  what could be better.   I wish the Highwaymen had put together more than three albums, I just loved them together|`|uxU5lOLYaa	Nothing I'd rather listen to than classic country.

As for my favorite classic country artist, I would have to go with Jerry Reed, who is also one of my all-time favorite guitarists, regardless of genre.  I was shocked when I heard of his passing back in September!  It's also a shame how underrated Jerry Reed is as a guitarist, but at least guys like session guitarist Brent Mason and solo artist Brad Paisley still appreciate Reed's playing!  Rock guitarist Eric Johnson actually has a song called "Tribute to Jerry Reed" and, recently, Brad Paisley had a rock instrumental called "Cliffs if Rock City" which was a tribute to Eric Johnson...anyway, Reed was a great guitarist and a great country artist!|`|4MJEWCjiaa	Country music is not my fav (especially the tear-in-your-beer type), but there is a lot of the earlier, cross-over music that I really do like.  <br>  <br>  I've seen Willie Nelson perform in Plains, and he put on a wonderful show!!  He's one person I think would be fun to spend an afternoon with!!<br>  <br>  And one of the best & most entertainig performances I've ever seen was by Roy Clark (a real oldie).  He really appreciated his fans and wow, can he play!!!!!!!|`|At7iKpONaa	Its the best of the best. Without our classic country artists, there would be no country music at all. And I think people forget that, and take it for granted. When people say things like "i like new country just not that twangy old stuff" I want to scream. HELLO! you wouldn't have your precious 'new' country without "that twangy old stuff". Which, by the way, I love. Hank Sr is my favorite singer of all time. I think that's been said a million times. lol. But I'll say it a million more! Peace, Love, & Hank Williams!|`|2Hl4AAP7aa	YES some of my favorites are george jones -hank williams- waylon -merle-marty robbins-webb pierce- red sovine-ray price- farron young.there are so many and i listen to a continuous country classics radio station on my computer and in my home, thanks to galaxy radio.|`|WaYZQhnHaa	I LOVE classic country music.  :)  I have a lot of favorite artists, but I think Waylon Jennings might be at the top of the list.

sSdbfJpJaa	Very interesting question but I'm surprised to see few answers! Probably they thought the question was on cellphone billing system! <br>  I understand that it's good to be a prepaid type person but I'm a little different & I love to be post paid type women. The way your local phone providers keep a deposit (perhaps as security money), same way, I keep deposit my "future planing", "budget" etc. So, I never overdo anything & my phone-line (here my daily life) remain on always. At some crucial moment, I need lines (some of my jobs to be done) & I'm out of money, then? Prepaid type of life wouldn't help! Isn't it better to cross the credit limit for a short period? At least one has to run one's life! So, for a calculative person, a postpaid lifestyle is preferable. Thanks for a witty posting, Dada!|`|vUZkXOwOaa	As i'm independent, so,i don't like to fix myself within any limitations.

I just laughed out loud for 10/12 minutes seeing your question! Well, in my country too, there are postpaid & prepaid connections.

If necessary, I'll put extra amount to carry on the unfinished jobs. <br>  p.s. Have you noticed that most of the answers above are on cellphone! Whereas you never did ask anything on cellphone, right?|`|5fJkuRTjaa	In my country, we call post paid a plan or a cap.

Though, I also like Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall for his down to earth qualities and his values.|`|26bxbVPxaa	Gordon Ramsey is my all time favourite chef|`|QuUoDkBLaa	Gordon Ramsay!|`|4lHtlCRdaa	gordon ramsay because he is so intense, but he makes sure the message gets through...|`|Lsao2guSaa	It's got  to be Gordon Ramsay-I love his attitude|`|ouzrDPaSaa	Mine is Gordon Ramsey, I find his temper really funny/|`|NGHdmQwoaa	rachel ray (she hosts food networks cooking show 30 minute meals)<br>  here check out some of her recipes<br>  <a href="http://www.rachaelraymag.com/recipes/30-minute-meals/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rachaelraymag.com/recipes/30-...</a>
9cfe5e64fad9e5fc07aa9a8164bd3c59aa	The primary characters were actors who followed a "script" to a degree, but they also had to ad-lib as their character when interacting with the other (unsuspecting non-actors) in the different scenes.<br>  <br>  Borat, Azamot (Borat's producer in the movie) and Luenell (the prostitute he invites to that dinner) were all actors.<br>  <br>  The rest were real people Borat interacted with, including the Kazakh villagers from the start and very end of the movie. It was suppose to be in Kazakhstan but was actually a small Romanian village.<br>  <br>  And as others have mentioned here, almost everyone ended up suing or threatening to sue the movie studio and Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat) etc, including those Romanian villagers, the frat boys in the mobile home, the scared guy he chased down the street in NYC, and even a guy named Mahir Cagri (who old timers on the net will recognize as the "I Kiss You" guy) and an Israeli comedian who claimed Borat stole his 'wa wa wee wa' catch phrase. LOL<br>  <br>  So you are correct in your question - it's a combination of actors as well as random people he either schedules an interview with in advance or just happens to bump into or be around.<br>  <br>  Also keep an eye out for Sacha Baron Cohen's next movie which is very similar to Borat - since he also plays a fictional character and interacts with unsuspecting people - but instead of being a foreign news reporter he plays a gay fashion reporter.|`|xnBbmCkCaa	Borat is an actor. His real name is Sasha Cohen. You're not dumb, I think that is an interesting question. I don't know either.|`|56bNLJykaa	I believe it was actually all scripted out and that even though some scenes seemed candid, they were not.. But I have also heard the other way, that some of those scenes were shot with unsuspecting people|`|1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	They are not all random people in that they just went in and spoke to these people.  Most of them were told the same story they were told in the film ... that he was a journalist from another country filming American customs.  That's who they thought he was.  When they had to make an appointment with someone, like the driving instructor and the joke teacher for instance, that's what they told them.  Most of the people, but not all of them, were upset when they found out who he really was and when they saw the final film.  Some of them sued, but I don't believe any of them prevailed.|`|7LdjNoX7aa	no you're not dumb. <br>  <br>  Cause I have no idea what that movie was on about.|`|172pr9VPaa	Its random people.. That's why that movie got sewed so hard XD|`|sw2je9knaa	the people are not actors Borat is. I live near where the rodeo seen happened and heard about it in the local news before the movie ever came out. The people there were pissed and started to come after him so he was escorted out by police for his saftey.

GTZFpbfPaa	my grandma is awesome!!<br>  She knits me very comfortable socks and she and my grandpa are very rich so they give us lots of money at new years. I think she likes my cousins better cuz they live closer to her, but i dont mind.<br>  <br>  you may learn to love her one day??|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	Well look at your post<br>  <br>  when she came YOU DIDN'T LIKE HER.<br>  she can feel that you know.<br>  <br>  No wonder she'd rather be with a KINDER child. Look at how you even talk about your cousin. Don't you have feelings for anyone but yourself?|`|hi7uk4Kmaa	I love all of mine :)<br>  And my great grandparents!|`|wFsqpdN9aa	I love them x)|`|qnq5ex89aa	damn i would hate to have ur gma my are hella raw they dis on everybody sep me|`|0EaA6IACaa	only my dads parents are still alive and no i don't like them. they mooch off my dad because he has a lot of money. hey pays their taxes and for their mortgage oh their house...and he sends them money every month to help them pay their bills...but SOMEHOW they can afford to go on all these exotic vacations. hmm interesting. <br>  <br>  AND they talk sh!t about me and my cousins. nice huh?|`|mQlkWTkTaa	sometimes that just happens you know? <br>  I have tons of family members that im pretty sure hate me too.<br>  But just cuz their my family, doenst mean I have to LOVEthem right? Doesnt mean I have to hate them. Hate is sucha strong word and I hate to use it. Hating your grandma is a little harsh but I know how you feel. But she's still your grandma, and think of it this way: if she wasnt there, you wouldnt even be born. SOme people are so stubborn! your grandma seems a little rude...no offence. But Im sure that deep down she really does love you.<br>  <br>  Maybe ask your mom about it and then your mom can confront your grandma, and maybe things will get better.|`|y5FfKGAsaa	Wow, sorry to hear that.<br>  <br>  I have a good relationship with my grandma. She was there to take care of me when I was younger, and I love her for always being so caring.<br>  <br>  My grandpa, well, that I'm not very sure of. I met him for the first time last year. He has his own life in Cambodia, where my mom and family escaped during the war, which has brought them to the United States. <br>  <br>  He's now visiting for two years and living with us. My mom is the leader of our household. With that said, she's a really busy person. Now that my grandpa's here, she's working two jobs; her stable job and temporary job.. so she can help translate for my grandpa, and has to take care of everybody else in our family. It sucks. <br>  <br>  My grandpa thinks he can just take advantage of people, and get what he wants. Don't get me wrong, I respect him. I just wish he could be a little independent and not have to stress out my mom.|`|Ry4Jc96Aaa	the one grandma i have isn't a grandma to me or my family, we have a horrible relationship. she has like multiple personalities, shes very fake|`|2040myy2aa	i love them but i don't like them....like my dad's parents don't call me i don't see them or anything it's like they do not know me but most of his family is like that so yea|`|V29AonY7aa	Both of my grandmothers are dead, as for my grandfathers, one is them is racist and sexist, and the other is completely nuts and abandoned my grandmother with 8 kids and no job|`|ozCn1feYaa	i have my grandpa..the rest of them are dead. i actually like my grandpa. he's hilarious! but because he's jamaican, i can hardly understand what he's saying sometimes :/<br>  <br>  i just called him last week though|`|RtRYHKpDaa	Yeah, I dont have a good relationship with them.<br>  <br>  They dislike me, I dislike them. All bad when we are in the same room. Just not good.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yet, i don't want anything bad to happen to them.|`|f3QeLCZUaa	Definitely I like them as they are experienced machines. though they<br>  may not be modern but they attained lot of worldly experience<br>  which counts for the younger generation of the country or world.|`|a991rHLjaa	Haha, nope. <br>  <br>  I have one grandfather, whom I barely know. I don't even consider my other "grandparents" actual grandparents because they were dead long before I was born.|`|Tck4lXx5aa	sometimes|`|gwKxe7gGaa	My grandfather is pretty cool, I like him. But my STEP I said STEP grandmother is a ***** and a whore and lives off of people.|`|3zGTnghRaa	i love my grandparents|`|iphheJkoaa	Definitely not.  They have big *** mouths.|`|Qbczt3ivaa	I have 1 grandmother now, but I never got to meet/see any of my grandparents. only in pictures, but thats it....:(|`|59ZwxlPFaa	I;m sorry to hear that!!! Me myself didn't have the best relationship with my grandparents. Have u tried talking to her?|`|MHMndoCcaa	i love my grandparents....to death|`|NAPkWoI2aa	Lolz. But, nope.<br>  <br>  I like my grandparents. They are fun. Well, only my mom's parents. My dad's parents are kinda different. Lolz. Well, the grandparents I like are really nice to me. They always buy me everything I want. Whether or not if it is $100. I mean they bought me an iPhone. I mean come on! Most, grandparents don't buy that type of stuff for their grand kids. They always take us to places that are fun including, water parks, carowinds, and the pool, which has a water slide, that I love. They are great! I mean I like my other grandparents, but they aren't fun. If we want to get something we go to Walmart or Dollar General. Walmart  has nothing really that I want. Dollar General OMG! Who takes there grand kids there. Seriously! Well, now you know the story about my grandparents! Hope you liked it! :)|`|nG9nxMySaa	grandparents can be very strange. i just have one grandma left and our relationship is kind of ok now but for a while it was bad because i overheard her on the phone with my aunt saying mean things about me. it was really weird and very hurtful but after a couple years, i let go of it and now we talk once in a while. we are nice to each other but not that close. my grandmother also talks about my cousins all the time, but i don't care anymore. i think she is just proud of them and wants to kind of build them up and make them sounds really great.<br>  <br>  i sometimes wish i had that sweet little wise granny who makes cookies and knits you scarves and thinks you're the best thing ever and gives great advice, but that's not who she is, so oh well! i try to appreciate her better qualities and i just ignore her annoying/mean ones. at this point i just figure, she's an old lady so whatever makes her happy, ya know? i have good parents, so i am thankful for that. <br>  <br>  try to keep being kind to her, even if she does not treat you well. it sucks to have crappy grandparents, but there are many worse things. hopefully you get along better with your parents; that is much more important. maybe you could talk to them about your grandma?<br>  <br>  & did she really use the word "hella"? lol|`|KMtXVAPXaa	i dont have any ... but hearing this i am glad in a way i dont .... my mother is old enough to be my grandma so i just think of her as one ... and thats enough for me .. lmao|`|FwJLD1uDaa	im sorry shes like that :(<br>  <br>  i wont brag too much about my grandparents, but i love them bunches!|`|mggll8dRaa	Mine are long gone 'to Heaven', but never forgotten....!!|`|lILfQh6xaa	no. i love my grandmother. I never really knew one of my granddads. other set of grandparents died in 1989 and 90. i actually knew my great grandmother.all were cool|`|sICqdaDzaa	Same here, I HATE my grandparents, and they hate me as well. My grandparents always tell my parents to stop wasting stuff on me and that they should kick me out.|`|A3zAXntxaa	I love my grandparents. Love them well they last.<br>  It'll be sooner then you think.|`|ib00OjJXaa	my grandmother died of cancer when i was 6 years old.<br>  however my grandfather is still alive, i do not, i repeat do not like him. i haven't seen him in...well...5-6 years. i herd he treated my gram wrong...so apparently when i was little i called him a ******* asshole nd he was the one who caused her death to come earlier.<br>  and not only do i hate him, i hate his old smelly girlfriend! she wanted to replace my grandmother during the day she passed away. my mom had to curse her out.<br>  <br>  nice story huh? lol
w1z5dBVyaa	It should be a good movie.|`|dL4x119gaa	if you thought batman was good just wait til you see watchmen.<br>  <br>  it's gonna be killer. i can't wait|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	I'm not familiar with the graphic novel, so the trailer is all I have to go on. Based on the trailer it looks like an X-Men knockoff and I don't have high expectations. I'll watch it and I'm open to have my mind changed, but I don't expect much at this point.|`|capSLZQXaa	Based off the source material, it should be a great movie. However, there's been so many cuts, I'm going into this movie with my guard up a little.|`|D8sN8gNFaa	It will be exactly like 300, for the fact that, the visuals will be the main focus, and the acting will be on the back burner.|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Yeah, it looks interesting.  I'm disappointed though, for some reason I thought Keanu Reeves was in it.|`|mzhFrm5Taa	I think it will be ok<br>  I'm gonna see it anyway|`|KvmjaU86aa	If you haven't read the graphic novel back in 90's you might be disappointed if you're expecting a superhero movie. The story is more about politics and philosophy rather than saving the world. But movies tend to hack and slash comic characters to make the plot much simpler for the mainstream folk so it might not even be based on the book at all like most of the comic movies we've seen lately for example "rise of the silver surfer" was a big let down. <br>  <br>  Based on the trailer I think they might do it right this time  "I hope"|`|5pUQtl3taa	I really hate comics/ video games being portrayed in film...why?...because they are never really made into a great adaption...<br>  my only exception will be for Sin City..since the director Robert rodriguez did use the original Screen play/ Comic|`|AxkYUq56aa	The source material is arguably the greatest graphic novel of all time.  The script got Alan Moore's thumbs up.  See the movie.  Trust me.|`|AA11485682	It seems like it will be fine.|`|oa2gqqKTaa	it's going to be awesome. me and like 3 friends r going JUST to hear the song over the end credits that is played by our favorite band.|`|v322rhNLaa	Why dont you download it?and learn how it is.

She mounts the horse  unassisted, and the horse immediately springs into motion. It gallops along at  a steady and rhythmic pace, but the blonde begins to slide from the saddle.    In terror, she grabs for the horse's mane, but cannot seem to get a  firm grip. She tries to throw her arms around the horse's neck, but she slides  down the horse's side anyway The horse gallops along, seemingly impervious to  its slipping rider.   Finally, giving up her frail grip, the blonde  attempts to leap away from the horse and throw herself to safety.  Unfortunately, her foot has become entangled in the stirrup; she is now at the  mercy of the horse's pounding hooves as her head is struck against the ground  over and over.   As her head is battered against the ground, she is mere  moments away from unconsciousness when to her great fortune.....

lDBI2PoWaa	Radio Head - 15 Step is at the end.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing the one like Bella's Lullaby is on the Twilight Score by Carter Burwell.  Otherwise do you know when it specifically plays I might be able to find it?<br>  Or you maybe talking about The River Runs Through You.  They used this for Bella's Lullaby in the movie while it is different on the soundtrack.<br>  <br>  I was just going to say How I Would Die or Phascination Phase.

NWa45ZDIaa	Yes, I've heard from people that have visited her show (& a friend of mine who was even on her show) that's she's not brightest bulb in the chandelier. She HAS to have her cue cards & she has to read them word for word, otherwise she has to ad-lib & usually makes a complete fool of herself, she often can't even read the cue cards correctly, so that's probably why she sounds like an idiot when she tries to talk. What happened to her? She used to be a decent person really making a difference, & then these last few years she lost her brain cells & really is doing more damage then good. She needs to retire!|`|C7umw5Vpaa	Whoa... Lol. She does that because she's desperate and eager to get her point across. No, it doesn't bother me. I notice but I don't care. I did watch the T.I  interview and when he talked about all the tragedy in his life recently and to Tyra, He spoke with such an impressive vocabulary, that she then decided to use such word as an, 'idiot-deviant', or defiant, when referring to his usage of language and if he was that. To sound on the same level as his. I thought it was funny since she's always is trying to get the words out her mouth because she always seems to be excited. I like her. She likes giving her time to those who feel less than, emotionally. Although, some people are taking it as a joke for this. Now, that's annoying. You don't know what's real anymore, lol.|`|htBHCNDtaa	Cause she thinks its sexy and interesting.<br>  <br>  I really hate her now. She's so fake on ANTM and I used to think she was cool a few years back.<br>  <br>  Now she's an uppity b*tch.<br>  <br>  And to those other people - she was born and raised in America (California to be exact) so there is no excuse.|`|Dwt4EBdSaa	Because she isn't a fluent english speaker.|`|up676wNwaa	unfortuantly TYRA lives in the world of TYRA...she is opiniated and judgemental...she needs to get out there and get dirty SHE pauses because she thinks she is better than the whole female population and is just trying to give us an inch of her beauty and vocabulary so we can scratch the bottom of her used to be super model heels as she walks all over us . enough said|`|FbwyvwEYaa	Maybe because she DOESNT talk like that! Gosh.|`|BGKIJeTGaa	She might have NOT come from America or any other country with English as a first language.|`|valvULe3aa	I've always wondered the same thing.... I guess because everything is all about <br>  <br>  "ME!" (Haha, it's a joke from The Soup on E!.

Ogducl0vaa	I like Country/Pop and the Oldies and he likes Hard Rock @ work (Swing Shift with a co-worker).  But at Home he likes:  The Oldies and Mix 94 FM out of Eugene, OR|`|ZHi6lgnlaa	kinda but not really he likes fast upbeat songs and i like slow songs|`|AA11149042	we like some of the same rap and some other stuff. There are bands she likes that I don't and vice versa.|`|cqQQ2LNRaa	music we don't like, my other half loves country and acoustic, I can't stand country just because the way the music goes and sounds, and acoustic, depends on what acoustic it is... like i don't mind Your Love by The Outfield (80's)<br>  <br>  i'm into dance/trance/electronica, hard rock, r&b, some rap, chill out/relaxation music which he can't stand listening to... i'm more into the DJs and remixes...<br>  <br>  <br>  songs we like together, 80's and old school rap, and if i can find remixes of the 80's, he loves that... like Major Tom by Peter Schilling, the chill out version, it's slower and has more of a cold, chill icicle effect to it.|`|4x6Gkm86aa	There's not much music we have in common. He really likes the old stuff like Dr Hook (which I don't mind in small amounts, just not entire cd's at a time), Neil Diamond, and UB40 (again, in small doses is good). I'm more of a rock person myself, and he doesn't like a lot of my music either.|`|NHG8JPIAaa	She likes country<br>  <br>  I like r&b and rock
vH2OF9z8aa	and i thought you would have Six of Cups): Opening your heart to the simple pleasures of life. Fond memories fuel the playful embrace of love and life. Experiencing the joy of youth and sexual innocence. Engaging in acts of gentle kindness. Harmony of natural forces without effort or strain. Meeting an old friend. <br>   The card in the lower left represents how your partner sees you. Congo La Place (Knight of Cups): The essence of water behaving as fire, such as a rushing river: A passionate romantic, full of charm and beauty, but prone to extremes. Forceful idealism blended with gentle kindness. An eager and intense person, forward with their emotions and tender in their support of others. <br>   The card in the lower right represents what your partner feels about you. Azaka La Flambeau (Ten of Wands): Success and gain, leading you to take on a burden greater than you can carry. Noble leadership transformed, through lack of restraint, into tyranny. The crushing weight of ultimate responsibility. Having spent their fuel, the engines of creation grind to a halt. <br>   The card in the center represents the present status or challenge of the relationship. Simbi d'l'eau (Eight of Cups): Losing interest in a matter deeply important to you. Being forced to abandon something in which you had invested great love and devotion.

It laid an egg. That egg, was the next step in evolution, and was therefore... the first chicken egg.|`|dvvQQ6eRaa	The chicken.

A fully grown chicken is capable of taking care of itself and capable of producing eggs, while an egg is incapable of even hatching without the mother hen to keep it warm and protected. Therefore, the egg requires the chicken to survive and is incapable of becoming a chicken without one that already exists.|`|dk8y4eseaa	The chicken needs a rooster to fertilize the egg. So without the parents no egg would have been produced.<br>  Unless an egg just magically popped out of nowhere and hatched. I doubt it.

TbW8hD4Haa	good on you mate,<br>  what goes around comes around.. the people who say this to you will get their complications in life, dont you worry about that.<br>  argh, why cant people just accept others?|`|RQfLKOPQaa	If you strongly believe that everyone has the right to their opinion, you shouldn't deny yourself that right. You don't need to have an argument or lash out. But you should make yourself heard. It's nice that you think of others first, but you shouldn't let that interfere with your own rights. Usually I make choices. I think and decide if what I want to say is worth it. Is it worth standing for. If it is, I make my stand. If it's not, I don't bother. For example, if someone calls me bald, it's rude of them, but I don't really care. I cut my hair really short because i am going bald. If someone calls me a liar, I'll kick their ***, no hesitation. Some things are worth it, some are not. If  chose to lash at everything, nobody will take me seriously, I'll just be a hot head. If I lash at nothing, then people will think they can walk all over me. I show restraint for some things, and for others I am completely intolerant. It's a balance, and only you can decide  what to do. Regarding your question specifically, if people say those comments, I wouldn't take it.<br>  There's a line in a song, the song isn't that great, but this line stuck with me: I accept responsibility for what I've done, but not for who I am.|`|XHRquczeaa	It's not a bad thing to feel like that!<br>  And, it's a good thing you avoid arguments especially if it leads to violence.|`|wfMF0pbKaa	It's great that you have self control, but sometimes it's not good to bottle everything up inside..<br>  If you could *calmly* discuss, then I think you should.|`|9f06f93b066c7a2add024105115b5117aa	ITS CALLED SELF CONTROL!

AxkYUq56aa	American drivel?  You're posting your answer on a site that's produced by "American drivel," so shut it.<br>  <br>  As for the question at hand, yes, Slumdog should win, as it is, overall, the most effective and enjoyable of the oscar nominated films.  Now, had Dark Knight been rightfully nominated, it would be a different story, but the Academy is mostly composed of out of touch dinosaurs.|`|NrOuDXW4aa	All these things are just a matter of personal taste.  Yesterday I listened as too critics argued over whether Slumdog should win.  One thought it the best movie of the year the other thought it was boring.  All I can say is its as worthy as any other entrent.<br>  <br>  The Reader might of had a chance but it is seen as too sympathetic to the nazis or at least not anti nazi enough.|`|MVZ6Mpa1aa	LOL seems like an argument going on hehe  I hope it wins btw to help those kids.|`|S5w3fOEEaa	Yes i very much believe it deserves to win.|`|f9440ee6f423d4970bad3c1e64047e3faa	yah..as expected!|`|YtE7YXJWaa	Hi Disco Superfly<br>  Yes I do<br>  Sid|`|a6j7Bu9daa	its better than any of the american drival<br>  <br>  go and suck a co*ck|`|uurgL3oZaa	No. Wasn't the best picture last year.|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	Among the 5 nominated, I think it is clearly the best. I think The Reader would be the most likely to pull out an upset. Had Dark Knight been nominated instead of Benjamin Button, I think it would have been a much closer competition. But I still think Slumdog would have won.

I started running towards the McDonalds when I was really really high and ordered twenty seven Big Macs and a barrel of chicken McNuggets. I started eating and then the ghost of Abraham Lincoln started taking all of my nuggets so I pulled out a mace and I swung it at him but he was a ghost so it didn't do anything then I realized I just ate a bag of mushrooms so I was tripping out. Then I left McDonalds without paying and a short Mexican started chasing me down the street and so I cut off my nipples with a cooking knife and started throwing my nipples at him and he turned into a bag of skittles and then I ate them and consumed his soul. Then I started chasing a bus without my pants on and I put my balls on the window of the bus and these two people started having sex on the bus and so then I yelled out ORGY!!! and everybody started having unprotected sex with eachother, I ended up with a rather large woman who was beating me off with one hand and shoving her other hand up a goat's butthole. I popped the hemmerhoid on my *** and I put it on my nose so I looked like a clown. Everybody started pissing and shitting and cumming and bleeding in a pile and everybody in the world started rolling in this big pile of *** and blood and piss and **** and then I started fisting an immigrant from Guam and after I cummed all over the place I drank an entire bottle of Jack Daniels<br>  <br>  <br>  Then I woke up from my dream and ran right to counseling.|`|caVLeRKXaa	unicorn pie and magical sprinkles ontop with a spegettie noodle onion ring flavered pacerfier in the center that my pet choclate bunny suckes on while i eat the pie and then my sister apolla makes a leprocorn pie with rainbows and money for toppings and she throws it in the monkeyskoolteachers face and the monkeyskoolteachers name is mrs meanyshnorer and it all happened at lake lappogoopwaterpiespiespies|`|59cnZfTeaa	hitler and a clown were molesting me last night and all i could think of was the type of ice cream god eats. what flavour would he eat? cause he could make any flavour he wanted regardless of whether it was a food or not. so what would he make? then i got so frustrated i set my house on fire and i died for some reason.|`|spjRgyx6aa	nothing made up, but I thought of this song I knew as a kid - here's a bit of it. <br>  <br>  Singing ragalina ragalina ooka chucka waka naka oka poka noka was her name (clap clap).|`|JvcjY4Joaa	The power went out.

It is also defined more broadly as an absence of belief in deities, or nontheism.<br>  <br>  Many self-described atheists are skeptical of all supernatural beings and cite a lack of empirical evidence for the existence of deities. Others argue for atheism on philosophical, social or historical grounds. Although many self-described atheists tend toward secular philosophies such as humanismand naturalism, there is no one ideology or set of behaviors to which all atheists adhere; and some religions, such as Jainism and Buddhism, do not require belief in a personal god.<br>  <br>  The term atheism originated as a pejorative epithet applied to any person or belief in conflict with established religion. With the spread of freethought, scientific skepticism, and criticism of religion, the term began to gather a more specific meaning and has been increasingly used as a self-description by atheists.

80ehnLBJaa	I'm a huge fan of classic films, so I have many favorites.<br>  <br>  1. Bette Davis--"Now, Voyager" (1942,) "Dark Victory" (1939) & "All About Eve" (1950) She demands your attention when she is onscreen.  I've seen 80 of her films, so far!  <br>  <br>  2. Barbara Stanwyck--"Baby Face" (1933,) "Double Indemnity" (1944) & "The Lady Eve" (1941) I really enjoy her pre-code films (1929-1934.)  Those films are fun and a bit risque.  But, she was also a great comedienne and femme fatale in the film noir genre.  <br>  <br>  3. Myrna Loy--"The Thin Man" (1934) & "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House" (1948)  She began in Hollywood in silent films as the dangerous exotic and later bacame the "perfect wife."  She was wonderful as Nora to William Powell's Nick Charles.<br>  <br>  4. Joan Crawford--"The Unknown" (1927) & "The Women" (1939)  She was a great talent whose image and legacy have been overshadowed by rumor and legend.<br>  <br>  5. Jean Harlow--"Libeled Lady" (1936,) "Wife vs. Secretary" (1936) & "Dinner at Eight" (1933) Gone before her time.  She was typecast as the platinum blonde. She didn't get the chance to break free of that image.  But, she did leave behind some great work.<br>  <br>  6. Norma Shearer--"The Women" (1939,) "Strange Interlude" (1932) & "He Who Gets Slapped" (1924)  Her career spanned from the silents into the early 1940's. <br>  <br>  7. Kay Francis "Jewel Robbery" (1932) & "One Way Passage" (1932)  Sadly, she is an almost forgotten pre-code goddess.<br>  <br>  Also:<br>  <br>  8. Olivia de Havilland--"To Each His Own" (1946) & "The Heiress" (1949)<br>  <br>  9. Joan Blondell--"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" (1945) & a multitude of early Busby Berkely films<br>  <br>  10. Carole Lombard--"Nothing Sacred" (1937,) "In Name Only" (1939) & "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" (1941)|`|o2FJIXS9aa	Kate Winslet. I think she is grounded and a really beautiful girl and wonderful actress. I think she's good in anything. My favorite? I would have to say "The Holiday." Probably not the most critically accIaimed movie she's done but I thought she was cute bringing the older man back into life. I also liked "Little Children" "Heavenly Creatures" and of course "Titanic."|`|dc2cb706f625bf4f0720140360b38e90aa	Depends on the role, but Heather Graham has done some amazing work.

I would definitely not say I am a "fan" of anime but there have been a few good anime films I have seen.|`|s7UWLOS9aa	It also seems so childish, immature, and gay to b!tch about it, too.<br>  Movie: The Uninvited|`|38cc8157846426266baa6afc6d5ab186aa	Anime always felt like something intensely, totally personal to me. Some of them seem almost like the artist's personal fantasies(sexual or otherwise) played out on screen! It can be very, very compelling. I actually started watching it only recently - I used to hate anime art and the squeaky dubbed voices, so I refused to watch it. But my sister got into it and made me watch some, and I actually started to like it!(not the squeaky dubbed voices - I watch the ones with subtitles)<br>  <br>  To be honest, I think a lot of the spirit of anime is essentially Japanese, in that they have this set of social rules that cannot be disobeyed. and they see dynamics in the world that others, who think that destiny is in their own hands, don't. The Japanese always accept the inevitable (sounds like I'm stereotyping, btu I'm not!) Most of the anime I've seen seems to rebel against this mentality, or at least consider breaking the rules and still succeeding to be great. Probably because the artisit are modern japanese and have contact with the psych of the rest of the world<br>  <br>  One reason why I like anime is the involved storylines. While most movies/shows from Hollywood seem to think that humour/star power trumps everything (I am seriously getting sick of the pseudo-funny interruptions in those adult-animation movies) anime is unabashedly all about the storyline. And what storylines! They just keep getting more and more detailed. Maybe everybody's idea of fun is not figuring out who killed whom who killed whose father, but I love it!<br>  <br>  And my favourite movie of all time...I loved Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind - among others.|`|KH9bbeCNaa	i hate anime i hate manga, they are just terrible gay characters|`|DwI2MV53aa	I know exactly what you mean. It's stupid! Little crappy Chinese animations that look like their heads will pop off any second is NOT entertaining...WTF had happened to comics?!

I saw the movie yesterday with my friends. One of my friends slept off in the middle of the movie and he says that he couldn't understand it. Prem Chopra was great in the movie. he he.. he's still hitting on woman. Vijay Raaz was also good but he gave his finest performance in the upcoming movie Barah Aana. I saw this movie in Pune film festival and I was like Wow. After a long gap Indian Audience will get to see this kind of movie. It’s much better than Slumdog millionaire. Read their blogs <a href="http://barah-aana-the-film.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://barah-aana-the-film.blogspot.com/</a>
cWuumdy7aa	its your own opinion about slumdog and lagaan both were good movies. lagaan was nominated in the foreign film category for oscar and was nominated but award went to other movie. Slumdog is competing in open category and got 10 nomination 3 of them to A R Rehman now let us see whether on monday morning indian time how many awards slum dog wins.Oscars do not differantiate between who made the film but over all excellence.|`|6HyIkR7Caa	Yes it's true, they got the awards because It's an English film produced by FOX. I have seen the movie but i didn't find it that great. Ya it's a well made movie but I don't understand how they bagged 8 Oscars. Upcoming movies like Barah Aana is more Authentic. The movie portrays the life of Common man in Mumbai in a much better way. Naseeruddin Shah has proved that he can do it better time and again. Though he speaks less in the movie but his eyes and his expression conveys everything. Check out this link <a href="http://barah-aana-the-film.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://barah-aana-the-film.blogspot.com/</a> to read the blogs of Barah Aana.|`|FKaoaD2yaa	In my opinion, what Slumdog Millionaire had over Lagaan is : Media support and too much publicity and a worldwide screening - it has nothing to do with being Indian or not<br>  <br>  Dont get me wrong - I LOVE Slumdog Millionaire and will be handing out cookies to everyone in my neighborhood if it bags a few Oscars. But I so wanted Lagaan to win the Oscars. It was such a beautiful movie - a true masterpiece performance from Aamir Khan, Gracy Singh & Rachel Shelley<br>  <br>  Lagaan had me engrossed for the full three running hours - full of soul-touching music, drama, humor, cinematic brillinace. Its about how a strong-minded individual leads his men to overcome resistance and differences in opinion - and standing their ground for a cause against a powerful opposition. This is common in most good-over-bad movies but what makes Lagaan brilliant is the way everything is brought together and presented to the audience.|`|76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	Sorry to tell you this, but evidentally the people/judges of the Golden Globes, the Directors Guild of America, the Society of Film Editors, etc. like SLUMDOG better than Lagann.  That doesn't make SLUMDOG a finer film - it only means it  appeals to more people, who happen to sit on the judging committees of these organizations.<br>  <br>  And in the end - so what? The movie Lagann is still a terrific picture.|`|S5w3fOEEaa	Even i was disappointed when Lagaan didn't win but what you need to consider here is that Lagaan was a movie made for the Indian audiences and Slumdog Millionaire is made for the western public. And Lagaan was nominated against some other movies. Slumdog has different contenders. Remember they aren't contending against each other. Lagaan is now a thing of the past. Support Slumdog if you please.|`|h7kBXxuCaa	because is was a original movie and it is a reality film|`|C7Ujon3Xaa	Simply because Lagaan was made by an Indian director and Slumdog Millionaire was made by a foreign director and was much 'over-hyped' and 'over-publicized'. And unfortunately, majority Indians have this<br>  ' foreign fixation' and they blindly lap up anyting that the foreigners dish out. For example, the dialogue in the movie 'This is real India, and this is real America'. If such a comment were to be made of a certain state or race, our local polticians would have raised a huge cry but when it comes to India, nobody bothers.<br>  <br>  I did like the movie Slumdog Millionaire but it beats me why Frieda Pinto who had hardly any role in the film is being acclaimed over the top or why A.R. Rahman who has created masterpieces through his career got nominated for an ordinary song like 'Jai Ho'!|`|d41e08bb3751292a4ef4365282a8edb2aa	I think that Slumdog Millionaire is getting more acknowledgement because it was released in America, so it can be honored at many American award functions. Laagan was released and publicized mainly in India, so I don't think it could have applied for many American awards. It was nominated for "Best Foreign Film" at the Oscars. I don't think it has anything to do with racism on judges' parts.|`|g3m7Z5Ewaa	I have never seen the movie Lagaan but Slumdog was excellent.  For a movie to get to oscar standard it needs to well made which Slumdog certainly was.  More down to how film if marketed than the directors nationality.<br>  <br>  I'll look out for Lagaan though.|`|yIELd7Joaa	i think you are right the oscar judges are quite racist thats why not even a single indian movie has ever won an oscar.<br>  they like slumdog millionaire because it has been directed by a foreign director and it also shows about the poverty india is facing.|`|Gol2ReRRaa	because  indian driectors<br>    are not considred by american people because its all indian fate|`|JFhoaxZjaa	my opinion is that you are right becoz lagaan and mother india is much better than this movie.........|`|Cw3X90wEaa	undoubtedly<br>  u r on bull's eye

It was kind of an abandoned street behind the school, too, and no one was really around. I was almost to the point of confronting her about rape, "Do you want me to take my pants of now?" but eventually the stupid old lady pulled a map out of her purse, and I was like, "Oh my God, you're so stupid!

mD7eAAoNaa	I know a Scorpio who is secretive but in a different way. She can't keep secrets other people tell her, but she keeps her own. She is ALWAYS plotting something against someone, e.g. what she can do to ruin so and so's day, what she can do to burst someone's bubble, etc. Stuff like that, she enjoys other people's misery. She's always plotting in her head, but happens to tell me about them. However, she likes to flaunt what happens in her life, put it out there, i.e. update her facebook status. Likes to spread gossip. I think she tells people things so they can like her more. She's a very weird and complicated Scorpio. Secretive and not so secretive. <br>  <br>  I have some Scorpio in my chart and I'd like to say that I can be pretty secretive. I don't like to talk of my plans until they have carried out. I just don't like people knowing about things sometimes. It's weird and hard to explain. <br>  <br>  Me answering this question doesn't make me so secretive anymore...|`|d9hzMrzwaa	my best friend is a scorpio and she can be pretty secritive|`|HSSuKNCUaa	I have two friends who are Scorpio.<br>  <br>  They are great people; no, amazing people, great friends. But they tell me JACK about their feelings, which is rather frustrating to me. If either one is upset about something, I can bet my bottom dollar on it I will never know about it. <br>  <br>  Also, what's really a pain, is that when you ask them how their relationship is going (which is something all my girlfriends just talk about, at least to some extent) it is ALWAYS "great". They are extremely secretive about romantic relationships; and though I understand it is private, it makes me feel extremely locked out to not even hear anything. It can go to such extremes that I wouldn't be surprised if they wouldn't tell anyone if they got married or were being abused or were broken up. <br>  <br>  I don't share all the details of my relationship, either, but I need my friends to know about my life to some extent so they can care about me the right way, and they were there before my boyfriend was. But Scorpio seems determined to not share anything with you. <br>  <br>  And it's not always good... because I've been friends with one of them for a really long time, and I feel completely traded in for a boyfriend. All her issues seem to stay between the two of them, I'm nice to have coffee with but actual substance is just too much privilege for me. <br>  <br>  I know I sound bitter :-P maybe this'll warn some Scorpios about locking out their friends shouldn't go to extremes?|`|MWe4hMm1aa	not really. the ones i know totally wh0re themselves out.|`|uGxWOIOdaa	They are mysterious.|`|FeRC5jkoaa	i'm a scorpio and i dont tell people sh*t!|`|d2uGruHiaa	Yeah, the Scorpios that I've met are really secretive. They'll start opening up to you in time.<br>  <br>  Here's one of the scenarios I was in with this guy that liked me.<br>  <br>  Him: Can I tell you something?<br>  Me: Um, sure?<br>  Him: I seriously like you a lot.<br>  Me: Why didn't you just tell me that from the beginning?<br>  Him: I don't know.<br>  <br>  See, they are secretive. I guess it just depends on them. -.-"<br>  <br>  But I wish Scorpios would open up more. If they were to open up, I bet anything- that people would understand them.|`|9fHoK6Djaa	i'm a scorpio to the letter and pretty secretive, but it's usually trust issues.  just can't let EVERYONE in, sort of thing.  but if you are sincere and ask the right questions, you might be surprised.  scorpios are very deep, usually deep that others aren't comfortable to go that deep.|`|20b4pc5Raa	no scorpio that i know is secretive. i know five and they are all vain and un-serious.<br>  <br>  now, five scorpios don't mean they're the typical scorpios, but still...<br>  <br>  [edit] oh, thumbs down because you're scorpios, let me guess. get over yourselves, ''vains''. you give scorpios a bad name, i hope you're proud of this.|`|ZciTIyuCaa	Ummm, that's Scorpio's trait.<br>  <br>  So definitely yes.|`|BS2NaoVqaa	Yeah my dad 0_o<br>  He won't tell me anything - his salary, who he voted for PM..<br>  I didn't even find out he got a new job last month until my mum told me .. so I guess he is secretive|`|bYbSVvR4aa	My bf is a scorpio... unless you really ask in depth about his inner feelings, or LOL u will never never get anything...<br>  <br>  YES they ARE very secretive!<br>  <br>  too bad that is them.|`|DjJwKc9Caa	They suck|`|e4h5yVXgaa	haha... i think it's so funny when someone edits about the thumbs down they receive...<br>  <br>  anyhow, i am a scorpio and yes i am v secretive. it's just the way it is. but when i do say sth it can be so honest. ppl say: "you're so real". but then later they find out that im not on their side (im on nobodies side), though I will blab secrets (insight's) to both sides, in front of both of sides. I dont believe in courtesy. It is what it is... Even if I can use secrets for my own gain, I still know that unethical tactics are useless and too much work. I honestly do not pull any tricks. I love asking ppl blunt questions that I already know the answer to and I love announcing sth that I did (that most ppl wouldnt want to admit). I'm sorta of a mess like that.<br>  <br>  I hate when my mom would say: Dont tell the neighbours our business, did you? and I'd say yea I did, who cares if they know! they're no better than us!<br>  <br>  Or when this guy I was seeing (non-commitment) asked what did i do on valentine's day? i said i was w my x. (i was! a lot of folks would lie about that) and NO there was no hidden motive in it- it was just the truth. <br>  <br>  I'm secretive in a way that I don't offer information, but boy will I tell you or skirt around it (for reasons). it depends on who i am talking to.<br>  <br>  I can relate to the Taurean above. My bf (whom I've known for 7 yrs told me, I've known you for 7yrs and I still dont know anything about you)... that was weird to me! (i have no comment to that revelation).
bYbSVvR4aa	If there is a will, there will be a way.<br>  I am an aquarius, my bf is a scorpio.<br>  We do have quarrals now and then, it could be quite frequent especially he is quite insensitive towards my feelings (i have a cancer moon, known to be emotionally sensitive).<br>  Scorpios to me is pretty straight forward with i find it not easy to adapted totally.<br>  Nonetheless, isnt relationship all abt give and take?<br>  If you want it happen, then talk things out.<br>  ONE party wanting it to work cant be enough. BUT if both want it to happen, we can work hand in hand, be more understanding and always be there for eachother.<br>  <br>  i hope i've helps ;)<br>  best wishes :)|`|o2FJIXS9aa	Apparently this combo finds each other interesting, because I often hear of this team matched up. My youngest sister is an Aquarius and has been married to a really nice, calm Scorpio guy for over 12 years and they seem happy. She does have a Taurus moon, which is opposite his sun, and that might be the attraction. I am a Pisces sun and moon and used to be seriously crazy about a guy who was a Gemini sun and moon. For the life of me I couldn't figure that one out. Try www.astro.com. They give free short relationship reports, and if you have both birth times it will be more accurate.|`|x8dDKH3Maa	From msn.com<br>  <br>  The Aquarian flees emotional commitment, whereas the Scorpio swears by it, baffled by his or her partner's detachment. Aquarius defines him or herself as the freest of spirits; Scorpio sees love as possession, body and soul. However, as long as Plutonian jealousy is not aroused, this pair can build a mutually satisfying relationship. They respect each other and share a longing for extraordinary experiences. When the tension mounts, each can take refuge in his or her own world until it dissipates. Intuition and cleverness help this couple survive.<br>  <br>  To know more you really should figure out your rising sign, which is done according to the time you were born and where. If you know all of this info try googling "find rising sign free". it took me awhile (years ago) to find a site that would tell you for free but they are out there.|`|ba0f099392c4e5f361bd0e050604ae62aa	Well my past..very long but here it goes.<br>  <br>  To tell you the truth...its not a good relationship t all.<br>  The aquarius is a free spirit and doesnt like to be traped.<br>  They are aloof, independent, distant, unemotional..but they do got feeling..they just dont show them.<br>  The scorpio is jealous, clingy, possesive, obbessive.<br>  And when this couple meets up..it can totally blow because scorpio likes to show affection and aquarius doesn't..its hard for them to understand.<br>  But if that couple can keep up with their needs..it can work.<br>  <br>  I'm a scorpio with aquarius rising.<br>  I like to aloof, unemotional, independent.|`|uxV4FiXdaa	If you judge your relationships based on what time of the year his parents decided to have a kid, then it probably won't work out.|`|AA10176763	astrology is not the answer and i am an aquarius and they don't care about that.|`|R4xmThl1aa	that all depends you could always look into astrology for that answer, but even if you two turn out to be opposite symbols it could still work out, it just might take a little more work than usual.

ucVBQrbvaa	I get to re-name myself a LOT. I'm from another galaxy,and I like to live on Earth for extended periods of time. My actual name is Zenntasimm,but that doesn't even come CLOSE to working here,lol! So,I'll assume different names when I settle in different areas. My very first alias,in the late 40's,was Samuel,after Samuel Clemons(a.k.a. Mark Twain,my favorite Earth author). I tend to choose common names because I don't want to stand out.I'm usually John or Michael or David or Peter or something like that. Right now,my name is Thomas,it's the name I own this house in.<br>  <br>   Once,in the late 70s,I was back here for a couple of months and took the name Chet! My BEFF(Best Earth Friend Forever) laughed at me about that one for YEARS! "Het,Chet,ya done cleanin' the pig slop in the barn?",She would taunt! B**ch! God,I miss her.<br>  <br>   To answer the question,I would keep my name.Zenntasimm is very common where I come from,but I like it. I even have a first cousin with the same name,but I've always been 'Zenn',and he's always been 'Zimm',or 'Zimmie'. A name is only as good as you make it.I (mostly) like what my name stands for.|`|ib00OjJXaa	if i was allowed to<br>  idk<br>  Addy?<br>  <br>  i kind of like the name i have though<br>  its who i am|`|s6qgkfLxaa	I'd name myself something awesome.<br>  <br>  Like...

WYa3UY6Gaa	So some people with tongue rings are trashy..some aren't. <br>  <br>  <br>  A piercing is not trashy or something that makes a person trashy. <br>  <br>  A person's actions/words are what would make them trashy.|`|s7UWLOS9aa	Very much so.|`|AA10415600	yeah|`|5oGdBwh5aa	I think they are sexy. I love mine. lol|`|8cUR80R5aa	I used to have a tongue ring. No one I knew thought it was trashy. however when I had a suit type job I took it out because I thought it was unprofessional. So socially, no. But if you want to be taken seriously, not the best choice professionally.<br>  <br>  My circle of friends is filled with all types of people, mostly on the higher end of society, so they are open minded and not trashy.|`|Rlm7VjeEaa	They can be. I think it more depends on who has them.|`|DhmUgq0maa	Nope i have my tongue pierced and have had it for about 4 years, I got it because i wanted to not because someone else may find it hot!|`|qhU3PDgfaa	they look really cool.. but i dont think i would ever get one..|`|DwI2MV53aa	No just stupid because it makes someone sound like they're mentally retarded because they can't talk with metal in their mouth...just get an ear piercing and be happy with it...|`|ib00OjJXaa	no way...i think they're way awesome.<br>  i love piercings<br>  <br>  but of course my older sister and brother have their tongue pierced so maybe that's why i don't think its trashy lol|`|gvx9Jiteaa	yes of course...|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Yes.  Very hot on strippers and hookers though|`|U8oR3VU6aa	I don't care to watch people struggle to talk around a piercing. I really try to stay neutral about other people's choice of appearance, but it is irritating to have someone's speech impaired by a piercing and especially irritating when they can't stop playing with it while talking. I don't want to say they are trashy, just some people (not all) who have them are irritating.|`|7LdjNoX7aa	nope. They're not.|`|6v4KYFGoaa	The connotation of them is trashy because you usually think of a scene/emo/punk or whatever that does drugs and drinks that would have all those piercing, including a tongue piecing.|`|AA10365008	Yes.|`|sitkfn5Maa	no- there ok for some people and wrong for others and what the h*ll were you thinking to others as well.<br>  worse one i saw was tongue pierced and a chain from the tongue to the eyebrow piercing ugh.|`|VESGTNzSaa	Yes, I don't like them and they do look trashy.|`|myBoF6Dvaa	Bleh. They don't even look pretty. And look really uncomfy. And when you wear em', you look like you're about to kill someone from the pained expression on your face.|`|EiX4L2xQaa	Yes i can.t see why anybody would do that|`|XKhNw221aa	seeing as how everyone I know who has a tongue stud is trashy, then yes, they are trashy.|`|2kR4sX48aa	yes|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	people develop the opinion that they want them and that's cool if that's what they want.|`|uk5s9YVFaa	EWWWWW do not it gices infection and its ugly|`|ty1Ab0J3aa	no but i dont think id ever get one|`|un1Ltnvdaa	Yes, they lower a persons image.|`|nZTnlgnCaa	in some ways yes. but my friend has one. kind of trashy i think so.....<br>  but whatever floats your boat.|`|VSTRwNpdaa	Yes<br>  <br>  They are nasty...I cant understand why someone would want that|`|gBop9oMuaa	no but kinda icky|`|HBSyVp1kaa	no i have my tongue done|`|0LSLXwWVaa	Oh please, it's just a sign of the times we're living in. Like tattoos, excessive ear piercings, those beat up looking jeans (forgot what they're called). If I were young, I'd probably get one. But only if I knew I could maintain it.|`|pb7kgVrpaa	If the person is trashy,then yes.But in the same,I have a couple of large tats that some people would think the same of.I personally don't care for them.|`|kynzqmWgaa	depends who it is.|`|diLZQRUNaa	I have a friend who has one, and i can't seem to look anywhere but her tongue when shes talking. <br>  And they chip your teeth.<br>  Other then that if you strongly about getting one do it.|`|KFKOmKZSaa	no, but red berets and mickey rourke are|`|vzLKjmJBaa	No!<br>  They pwn because you can hide<br>  them if you really need to.<br>  The only this is...they hurt at first!|`|Dn8xd0Kuaa	yes tongue piercings are very trashy and also unhealthy to have.|`|AOtnoozdaa	Ick! They're gross!  Just my honest opinion though.  If you want one, it's your body.|`|DZ3BBDncaa	Not at all, I just consider them part of a persons self expression! And I love lip piercings.|`|c78cdb92e7d7cd9ceb1e43a932ae82bcaa	yes. it has to be.|`|Xds6e9k6aa	Uh , Naa. They're cool . :]<br>  <br>  Edit: Omg . Im the only one who disagrees .|`|CMUHp7vHaa	nope<br>  i like them :]|`|FRE2gov3aa	Yes!<br>  <br>  It's a sad way to impress someone.|`|0g9KmI80aa	yupp :] <br>  but thats just me.|`|zOU5fNHWaa	yes|`|EPDi4Z1Iaa	YES!|`|HiShZ86aaa	Yep :)|`|I1tnVvVGaa	absolutely not! i have one!|`|4sW8MFxCaa	noo sexyy hexyyyyy

I read that he doesn't like crazed fans. Unless you read several other magazines that sad different. Stalker.
g2QUNwZzaa	(from wikipedia's epiphone page)<br>  <br>  "In recent years Epiphone introduced a series of acoustic guitars named Masterbilt after a line of guitars of the 1930s. Today's Masterbilt guitars are manufactured in China."<br>  <br>  so, if they made one in china, its possible they made others too....<br>  fender makes guitars in lots of countries, like korea, india, mexico, italy, china..... so i'd think nothing if the guitar was from one of those eastern countries.....|`|FRNDkLNqaa	you reall know nothing about guitars do you?|`|HxHvhZAsaa	actually, all epiphones are fake. they are a knock off gibson really....if you want to know the truth...i am not just saying this because i like gibson, or because they look identical (i guess).<br>  there are many facts backing up that gibson is a knock off. <br>  <br>  im going to say that having a knock off of a knock off is not a good thing at all. made in china and a sticker?!<br>  <br>  i like esp's

CINGW70Saa	"Hardest riddle ever" (I think the percentages are B.S., myself, but, *shrugs*): <a href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/362594/the_worlds_hardest_riddle/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacafe.com/watch/362594/the...</a><br>  <br>  (The riddle here is missing the crucial final statement "Can you tell me what I am?")<br>  <br>  Answer: No.|`|MMI8S60Vaa	The hardest riddle I know is:<br>  You are trapped in a room with 3 light switches, and 1 door. Through the door is a room with 3 light-bulbs. The door is closed, and you can only open it once, and not prop it open, and if you can't answer the question, you wn't be able to get out. The question is: How can you tell which light swich goes with which light-bulb? And also, the lights are flicker-proof, so you can't just make one flicker. <br>  <br>  (The answer is, you flip one switch on and wait for a while. Then, you turn the second switch on, and go into the other room with the lightbulbs. The lightbulb that is warm goes to the first switch, the one that is on but not warm goes to the second switch, and the one that is off goes with the third switch.)|`|39ixfEIraa	What is lighter than air, can be seen by the naked eye, and if you put it in a barrel it will make the barrel lighter???<br>  <br>  answer: a hole<br>  <br>  from are you afraid of the dark lol|`|DTPXeX7vaa	If the Robber had seen the cop he wouldn't be going so fast.Why???<br>  A:He was in a get-away car w/ stolen goods in the back seat and the cop pulled him over for speeding.<br>  <br>  A man runs over a pig as he drives to a friends house.He doesn't stop or act like he hit the pig.Later at the friend's house a cop arrests him.how did he know he ran over the pig?<br>  A:The Pig Squealed.;)<br>  <br>  A man killed his wife.Many people watched him kill his wife but it could not be considered murder.How is this possible???<br>  A;He was a hang-man and his wife was sentanced to death.<br>  <br>  A woman goes to a store and find something she wants.She asks the clerk"how much are these?"

However, I think that what defines someone that is special to you varies on who you are asking. To me, a special person could be a friend, a lover, a family member. Someone who is there for you in good times and bad. Someone who makes you feel a certain connection when you are with them (either physical or emotional or both).  A person who is giving of themselves and has a good aura surrounding them. That would be my personal definition. Hope I've helped!|`|dCeuAvyxaa	VENUS REPRESENTS GIRL.

One girl is probably still wondering how she woke up w/ a smiley-face painted on one breast, & a bulls-eye on the other one (washable finger-paints). ~:D>|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	I used to duct-tape peoples legs together once they passed out at parties. Not the same person together, but every one in the room had one or both legs taped to someone else's legs. ^_^  I always made sure I was the last one awake and the first one up the next day. Except that time they got revenge and managed to duct tape me to the wall when I fell asleep.|`|DTPXeX7vaa	My dad  got drunk when i was about 5 i think.Well it was right before a family reunion.At the family reunion all he does is giggles and pile his plate with food.Lots of food.He had like 18 full plates of beans.I was glad i wasn't sitting by him.|`|z2cysiEhaa	Getting drunk at the Moomba festival in Australia whilst under age and having my friends hide me behind a bush only a metre from where the police were standing and asking my friends for ID. It was amazing they didnt see or hear me as i was as sick as a dog.<br>  By the way that was a long time ago and now  I've swapped alcohol with nice cups of tea instead. CHEERS!|`|KlClHOEkaa	you can't see properly   and you do stupid things.
kIblsxJQaa	Nope.  Cant see him the same way now.|`|Rlm7VjeEaa	Hell no. I won't even listen to his music. Did you see the picture of her? She was beaten to a pulp! What a shmuck!|`|oWYs6Btgaa	He's a very talented young man that happened to make a 'big' mistake.<br>  Let's pray and hope that he learned something very valuable to take with him as he grows as a person and man.<br>  <br>  I still like him and wish the best. He's human.|`|Kkxq4Tisaa	*cough* wife beater *cough*|`|AA10652430	He can take every last JOINT and shove it as far as I am concerned! >:P|`|ukxt9YdIaa	Still? i've never liked him.|`|ZKVlF2pKaa	I don't like him as a person, and it's irritating to listen to his music now. Because I used to really love his songs, but now when I hear them, I think about what happened to Rihanna. I'll reserve final judgment on whether or not I stop listening to his music altogether after the trial, because innocent until proven guilty is what makes this country great. However, I got to say, I highly doubt that he's innocent. But as neither have talked about that night, you never know.|`|S5aXfRmPaa	I never was the biggest fan, but I did like his music. What he did isn't going to change the fact that that he has amazing talent. He is just not someone I would like to meet. He was around this as a child so that could have been the cause of this (often it is). I don't really think he seems like a great person so I'm not a fan of him anymore but still of his talent!<br>  :)<br>  <br>  p.s. GET BETTER RIHANNA!<br>  <br>   ily?<br>  -Maya|`|uly3aFqtaa	No, I have lost all respect for the Bastard.<br>  <br>  I don't like his music anymore, either.<br>  Listening to 'With You' makes me wonder how someone can write such meaningful lyrics about the love of his life, and then bash the cr*p out of them...<br>  <br>  Xx.|`|bPXlYHlDaa	<a href="http://www.celeb-invasion.com/2009/02/rihannas-bruised-face-exposed/" rel="nofollow">http://www.celeb-invasion.com/2009/02/ri...</a>|`|EBKPbkj7aa	i never liked him,<br>  i was always neutral to him.<br>  i still am, don't really give about the situation.|`|mU6Owbhoaa	no never liked him, always thought he was a little c-o-c-k head|`|uYtV3WrPaa	nope but his songs are still good.|`|gtAb94d2aa	Never did, never will.|`|zZVpj4Ftaa	Hexx Yah.<br>  Who Cares.<br>  Thats His Personal Life Matter.<br>  Stop Spreading All This Crap..<br>  I've Been Through Crap Like This&&Know How It Feels.<br>  Exept Mines Was A DRAMA Issue..<br>  But The Whole Thing Might Be A Rumor.<br>  Who Knowes.<br>  Who Cares.<br>  ?|`|7bcQ9Xemaa	yeah, his music has nothing to do with his anger//domestic violence issues. and the boy can dance.<br>  <br>  ppl still played//liked MJ and R. Kelly when they were in trouble i dont see why this is such a huge deal compared to them.|`|olyZwMwmaa	damn didnt know YA was filled with CB haters but i still like his music i am not pissed at him or dissapointed nor taking his or rihanna's side but i still like both artists nothing has changed for me|`|T9OroHEJaa	yeah, everyone makes mistakes and **** happens, but it'll be good to hear both sides of stories and his musics hot!!!|`|9s5duQmFaa	yes...everybody desreves a second chance.You cant just start hating him..It's not like you know the whole story.|`|172pr9VPaa	I never liked him.... He is a fag, even if he didnt touch Rihanna|`|mtRtQIcWaa	no i love his songs tho|`|eeKlogL4aa	Never was a fan to begin with.<br>  I hate him now.
eeKlogL4aa	It's an amazing song and Taylor was very good as usual. Miley has the power to ruin things with that awful voice! Really talentless, she is!|`|uly3aFqtaa	I haven't seen that, but I have heard that Miley completely rooted the whole thing.<br>  <br>  I think i'll look it up on Youtube!<br>  <br>  Xx.|`|AA11540024	I couldn't even hear what they were singing because the background music was too loud.|`|S5aXfRmPaa	I feel Miley and Taylor both did an amazing job. They both put there heart into it. Taylor is always amazing. Miley is not consistent with her singing but she did a very good job. Miley just has a different voice that people do not often appreciate.|`|3lWXXwnNaa	I agree. Taylor Swift is very talented, while Miley is very talentless.|`|pt2Oy2DBaa	I like Taylor singing it because it was about her feelings and when miley sings there's no feeling. the only reason they sang together was because they both went out with a jobro.|`|Q9KgX9bfaa	miley has a nasty man voice, taylor has a sweet musical one.|`|ntj6nT28aa	Taylor = yay.<br>  <br>  Miley = NAY.<br>  <br>  <br>  Taylor, I'm not a huge fan of but she was alright. <br>  Miley... Ew. Don't even speak her name. Haha.|`|7EED5Ommaa	Miley ruined it|`|Vehm86Hyaa	Taylor was amazing but Miley wasnt, i guess thats not her kind of music, way too slow for her

He has a nice, smooth, complexion.|`|wEt7UiTsaa	NOT|`|df3epPP4aa	Not, I think they're all ugly.
I1K6SC43aa	They're all the same to me.<br>  <br>  All I care about is having an iPod that plays music.
GkhNdv0eaa	Neither one was from an episode - they were both just part of the opening credits.
Vy06ZUVnaa	well, i still watch it from time to time and i happen to think its hilarious. in fact, my friend Will's ringtone on my phone is "Dude, I Totally Miss You."|`|Kkxq4Tisaa	LOL THEYRE OLD...I USED TO LISTEN TO THEM 4 YRS AGO|`|8jQ3FBpAaa	I LOVE TENACIOUS D! i have a pick of desitny pick.|`|xIeNFefYaa	well u wanted our opinions<br>  and i think they suck

Yx5iSat4aa	She might be but she's skanky for those pics she took of herself in her undies.|`|xnBbmCkCaa	Wow, are you serious? Are you actually surprised that a SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD LITTLE GIRL is a virgin? Not everyone loses their virginity early, especially girls.|`|I1tnVvVGaa	no way|`|k6M48eUMaa	I doubt she is, but its not for me to judge.<br>  It is her personal choice and her own life, so I have no right to butt in. I think its ridiculous if a girl of her age, who is meant to be a role model, isn't a virgin, but meh, like I said its her life and her descision.|`|ftixHrOnaa	how can a whore be a virgin?|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Idk probably not|`|4sW8MFxCaa	i don't care!!!!!|`|56bNLJykaa	No|`|4BoteYDwaa	? I don't know her well enough to make a determination, the media can make you appear to be something your not. Anything is possible.|`|kLPaq30Eaa	Honestly, no. The guys she dates are usually older than her and from the compromising photos I've seen of her, I just don't think it's probable.|`|Rlm7VjeEaa	Hahahahahahahhahhahahahahaha no|`|hHQIUrNjaa	why do you care she ******* 16|`|OUbNSXjJaa	I think other cannot know.|`|Xnx7p7OHaa	Do you believe I don't care?|`|5NsgLFPRaa	Most likely not|`|cf7e502388f77678bbc75e745e427e26aa	"What do I think" - and I think about that a lot ... NOT<br>  I'm still wondering why Ms Liebowitz waited for Billy Ray to leave the room until she "made her move" on Mylie. (sick)<br>  <br>  I honestly don't know - IF you know what I mean. ...<br>   ...Vern|`|DwI2MV53aa	She's too ugly not to be|`|U8oR3VU6aa	I can honestly say this has never crossed my mind, but Hell no, I don't think she is a virgin. (It is in the eyes and the attitude)|`|xrf7ScCTaa	NO WAY|`|qMVOV9t4aa	She makes me feel dirty.|`|AA10345820	Don't know, don't care.|`|0mXQODsIaa	nah i dont lol. she has had like a 20 year old bf. but then again you never know.|`|ij9N9r5waa	I don't think daddy ever lets her out of his sight, so it's possible.  Has any guy bragged about the conquest.  Young guys:  If you hit that would you brag?|`|qwInrvUGaa	no and if she is she prolly won't be for long|`|064317bad909409f737c645b24ec5ae2aa	If that was true, I'm Mother Teresa.|`|qlcY8aKFaa	Shouldn't this question be under Jokes & Riddles.<br>  <br>  Are you kidding me.  She will have her own street corner soon.|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	Probably not, her boyfriend is like 35 right!?

Anatomically speaking.|`|AA11825975	Does it matter? Stay away from the kiddies.|`|ff772a25081c886385c2eb6a501e148aaa	Don't know. Don't care. Why should anybody care, it's nobody elses business|`|zOWLZkXraa	I believe only a really creepy person would fixate on such an issue.|`|uYtV3WrPaa	No way.|`|ptmEpFnoaa	i don't think so but anyways who cares??? people need to start caring about other things  in the world!!!!<br>  <br>  if shes not a virgin that's her decision ....|`|9lBe1JGAaa	Lol she didnt get to where she is now by staying a virgin.|`|VFrJHIs3aa	JES<br>  <br>  probibly.|`|MHMndoCcaa	no se|`|iccdlkSCaa	It's possible.|`|q4Qe8UdNaa	come on, this is a no brainer|`|bc7f2eca272c247b1b16daabe29dff21aa	i dont know and i dont really care.<br>  Most teenagers have sex by the time they are her age, so whats the big deal???|`|TkkJOa8zaa	there is no way in hell. she's probably already blown out, like Paris Hilton, or Elton John.|`|HBSyVp1kaa	no|`|AA10910187	no I don't really think she is...... idk why I just think that lol|`|DjJwKc9Caa	definitely not|`|uE2aOqeNaa	she is to young for me to even think about like that.|`|RcbolFQ2aa	i dont know what to believe anymore|`|zPU5npWaaa	dude. i know for a FACT that she isnt. if you know what i mean...|`|6HS1ot35aa	Yes she is!

I was laid off last week and I need access to your bank account to continue eating out 5 times a week. By the way, you're a terrific filmmaker, too.|`|S5w3fOEEaa	I would just like to thank him for creating a beautiful slum movie.

Thank you Danny once again for connecting me to my city again.|`|FKaoaD2yaa	I would second your message, however I have just one more thing to add <br>  <br>  "I hope more movies like this come out in future - with a message reaching everybody across the world.

TyJuZnZhaa	I love the first song. The best line is:<br>  <br>  "Don't point at me, I can't break my own heart."<br>  <br>  That has to be most the epic song lyric I have heard in a long time. Good job. <3<br>  <br>  The second song needs to be a bit meaner if you ask me. >.><br>  <br>  And the poem was very interesting. Good job on them all, anyway.<br>  <br>  I hope you are feeling better.|`|ulYTAfXtaa	I wish I could write like you.
XM7WXyEQaa	media givens them name like that <br>  plus they sound cool but now heaps of ppls are calling people <br>  who sing pop rock rockstars. which pisses me off<br>  i don't hate Mylie shes okay but NOT a rock star !!! popstar yes<br>  like she's talented enough ( she can play the guitar and sing pretty well) but gosh she so try hard!!! i say a pic of her in black dress and ripped tights trying to look emo/rockish <br>  <br>  Jonas brothers make me wanna puke when people call them rockstar<br>  Avril was good early on but now shes just trying to fake being a punk who likes pink glitter  <br>  Pink is pop rock definatly not a rock star but i like her okay <br>  <br>  i doubt that any off these 'rockstars' write any of their own songs with out professional help|`|16t0eV0Uaa	A rock artist life span is usually 30-50 years, usually parties, rocks the hell out, and chokes on his own vomit, and for the very extreme rock stars, after your done with your last gig on your tour, you commit suicide in front of the whole crowd!<br>  <br>  Though I do not recommend that last part.. you will be sure to be known as an infamous rock star!|`|hJP9y6kjaa	Because "rock star" is the new euphemism for "trendy poser".<br>  <br>  All you have to do to be a "rock star" is to dress fashionably and do drugs. And with today's health conscious society, the drugs aren't even what they used to be....<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	They think they're cool. Remember when Avril Lavinge used to be referred to as a "rock chick?", and now Miley Virus is too. Rock, ha.|`|94MyeH19aa	uhh they don't call themselves rockstars they just think they're cool. rockstar is someone like Coldplay or Pink, who don't play play real rock, its just a pop kind of sound, and they think theyre cool, but if they werent fashionable and party animals theyd have half as much attention. +1 to saul<br>  <br>  and the 1st comment's right too|`|d9hzMrzwaa	it makes me angry whenever somebody calls the jonas brothers rock stars. there the worst band ever! <br>  <br>  rock stars are queen(rip freddie mercury), van halen, kiss, nirvana, scorpions,ac/dc, metalica, and led zepplin|`|WU4MHq3aaa	this a lame vent
30r4coInaa	He really does look different but David Fumero is the same Cristian that has played the role since 1998.|`|ce35927379e187a9a9405823379c0faaaa	Not from the beginning. There was a teenage Christian when he was dating Starr. Then they upped the age. After a while, everyone thought he died. He came back a year later, same actor with a different hair do, and supposedly different attitude.|`|D3Fyxj0raa	yes

PtRmhxU9aa	A psychopath doesn't know the difference between right and wrong... a sociopath knows, but doesn't care.|`|0LSLXwWVaa	A psychopath could easily kill a room full of people. A sociopath would probably only kill one, and it would be his next door neighbor.<br>  So which one are you?|`|9f06f93b066c7a2add024105115b5117aa	EITHER WAY YOU GOT TROUBLE!|`|hvQAca85aa	the former is more harmfull than  the later|`|d5zEYomEaa	A psychopath does not feel a sense of compassion towards others or guilt over anything wrong they do. They can lie, deceive, steal and kill without it bothering them becaus they lack a conscience. A sociopath is the same thing, just another word used for it. Both are anti-social behaviors which go against social norms. Almost the whole prison population are diagnosed as psychopaths. They will sweet talk people into giving them money or rape a woman not caring how she feels as long as it satisfies his desires, they are the stockbrokers who take people's life savings and blow them on bad trades just to make commissions off of, they are the used car slaesmen who will sell a lemon just to make a buck. They are everywhere.

ADBMrG87aa	Nash was a easy friendly outgoing guy so yes Brody would become interesting friends quickly.  If Jessica becomes romantically involved with Brody and Nash returns, Jessica would break up with Brody and run back to Nash in a flash!

We never thought of this one!<br>  <br>  Hmmmmm....if that happens I think I will go with Jessica staying with Brody.  Because they have developed a bond that she didn't have with Nash.  (And I didn't work there when Jessica and Nash were in the picture...I came in right before Nash fell...so I don't really know how their realtionship started and continued except for a small part.)|`|7XM4QJiuaa	Nash is not coming back from the dead.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I don't know if they would be friends or not because Brody is wanting Jessica real bad.|`|AA12390047	Jessica won't have the option to break it off with Nash  - he's Dead!!<br>  I don't see Nash ever returning.  Brody can't be friends with a dead guy.
mD7eAAoNaa	Taureans like stability and commitment, so let him know that you are ready to get serious. Talk to him, approach him gently, express your feelings, basically just open up to him. As you already know they are very stubborn, so it would be a good idea to not be stubborn as well. Two stubborn people will just butt heads and the situation won't get any better.|`|ba0f099392c4e5f361bd0e050604ae62aa	Well sometimes guys just like their independence...and it does depend on what his moon sign is too..

They don't listen, they realize by themselves. He can't defeat someone who's not fighting against him. That's one way bulls see things. You can't tame a bull by going head-on. That only happens in sports.

ba0f099392c4e5f361bd0e050604ae62aa	Well i think the gemini/libra relationship..is good because their both air signs...Intellectual. <br>  But the one i think is best is the gemini/aquarius.<br>  I've seen many relationships with that match..and its just beautiful.<br>  They understand each other mentally and physically.<br>  They know what each others needs are..and they allow it.<br>  Both are just right..not too emotional and not too clingy.<br>  This relationship is perfect.:)|`|uD1S5dYtaa	The Gemini/Aquarius match will be very social, very out going, lots of meeting new people, going to meetings for new organizations for new societies.   A Gemini/Libra match would be more social concerning libraries, art shows, restaurant openings.  There is more status involved and more luxury of  accommodations and less idealism and exchange of radical ideas.
Z5mmaFK0aa	Is this a guy named Dan doing the playing? that's what is says so I am assuming the individual playing is Dan.<br>  <br>  Dans playing is pretty clean. Good guitar tone. The harmony like solos are good for the Riff structure. This is good riffage for the average rocker good average solos. <br>  <br>  But for my taste and what I like it was very difficult for me not to fall asleep. Don't take that personally I don't think you would anyway if you knew the stuff I generally listen too. So that's not a put down good playing but very average as well.<br>  <br>  I give it 2 red stars

56650a55637223b1b968b4235bb50735aa	I guess you never saw or heard of M*A*S*H.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	The Korean war only lasted three years(although technically it is still on, just in a truce state.)  Far more people died in WWII and Vietnam than in Korea.  It's kind of a small war in most people's minds and doesn't achieve any emotional response when discussed.  There wasn't any conflict at the time like there was over Vietnam.  There weren't any great battles like in WWII.  The last movie I can remember about it was MASH, and that was a satire about the medical corps during the war.  <br>  <br>  So unless a director or writer can come up with some hook to engage people's interest, Hollywood wouldn't invest in it.|`|NrOuDXW4aa	There have been many movies about the Korean war.  But it was a long time ago now and there are more recent conflicts that are likely to be in the minds of producers and viewers alike.  Whilst it was a nightmare for the participants for most people at home life went on normally and there wasn't the mass of TV media there to keep it in the public mind.  Not for nothing is it often called the forgotten war.<br>  <br>  Also wars where the USA didn't win are not really popular with the viewing public.  You will notice that most vietnam movies that concentrate on the war are highly fictionalized with America kicking viet-cong ***.|`|hWq5bxoyaa	Because some people call it a conflict not a war'<br>  They are total idiots.We lost to many good men and some are still missing. It is a misunderstood  war. But a war non the less.  It does not impress Hollywood.<br>    It does deserve more respect, as do the VETERANS

When the Beatles discovered mind altering drugs, the whole music scene changed (or it was about that time).  They were geniuses mixing and altering sound in and out of the studios.<br>  No, it will never be simple and innocent again.  We can't start over with the knowledge we have today.|`|MNyYWoFfaa	Do you mean succesful as in profitable?  If so, then not because songs can be easily downloaded these days.

ZyGyDLsDaa	I'm not sure why, but this one came to mind:<br>  Howling VI: The Freaks (1991)<br>  IMDb review: ***SPOILERS***<br>  Young hiker Ian Richards (Brendan Hughes) arrives in the small town of Canton Bluff. Once there, he asks for a job. Soon, the carnival comes to town, and owner R.B. Harker (Bruce Martyn Payne aka Bruce Payne) wants Ian once he discovers what he is: a werewolf. Once he captures him, Harker puts him in the freak show. Ian escapes and is out to get revenge on Harker, who killed his family years ago. But, Harker has a secret of his own: He is a vampire. The locals are out to kill Ian, thinking he's responsible for the murders in town, sending the young man into a confrontation with Harker~a battle of monsters.<br>  <br>  Perhaps this isn't it. If it's about a townful of vampires, it could be "Children of the Night" (1991), in which two high school girls inadvertently awaken a vampire when they go swimming in a flooded crypt beneath an abandoned church's grounds. I thought there was something about the grandmother being some sort of creature. I haven't seen this film since it first hit cable, so I have very vague memories.<br>  <br>  Of course, I could be overlooking some obvious film.

dRckqw9Uaa	It is definitely FUNNY GAMES, and a fine film it was. Evidently not well received in the U.S., playing with the conventions as it does, and making many reviewers/viewers upset or angry. The European director, who remade the earlier version of his film reportedly shot-for-shot, tweaked the noses of American audiences who are now stupidly conditioned to view the violent content of the usual cookie-cutter movies a certain way. I believe that may have been the thinking behind the "rewind" business, the director forcing us to identify with the killer -- as if to tell jaded audiences, you like violence? Here, you can have it. (Interestingly, most of the violence of FUNNY GAMES takes place off-screen.)<br>  <br>  There's a web site for an independent film called EVE'S PREYER that sounds intriguing, which I'm looking forward to seeing one day (www.evespreyer.com), and I was reminded of it while watching FUNNY GAMES. Psychological, although apparently not violent, abuse of a family is the theme with PREYER (in place of a son, there's a daughter), and it sounds like another uncompromising exercise.<br>  .|`|3rpMN1nXaa	I think it's 'Funny Games,' I've seen it and the movie your talking about sounds a lot like it.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	It sounds like "Funny Games."  I just got it through NetFlix.  I haven't watched it yet.  Thanks for ruining the ending for me.|`|8jQ3FBpAaa	i haven't seen it but i think it's Funny Games?

The uniqueness comes when the vocals start. Listen to the japanese techno ground Perfume (love the world and baby cruising love are the best) and listen to their vocals and instrumental. Maybe you'll find your answer there.

Stupid little games that belive it or not always lead to murder or rape.|`|GTZFpbfPaa	I am a girl, and for some reason, rather then guys come onto me, its always peoples dogs or peoples girlfriends. i dont know why. there was a lizard from the pet store come out once. it was interesting.<br>  <br>  btw, the question has a different seeming questions then what you mean.|`|r3o10XbAaa	i don't think it would be that awkward. i think it would show that he is confident in front of your friends, and probably is a nice guy.|`|TkkJOa8zaa	If one did, I would feel compelled to run away, and never return to that mall.|`|sICqdaDzaa	Yes, it was so awkward.|`|lFzFtiCBaa	First of all, if a guy approached me at the mall like that I'd prolly uppercut him, so no.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	yes but i am also a grown woman so.....................|`|Ry4Jc96Aaa	yeah, its really weird. i always dont know wheither to really give them my number or make one up or something.<br>  <br>  <br>  what do you do?!?|`|f3QeLCZUaa	It depends upon how you receive the person concerned. he may be<br>  right to ask you at the nick of the time hence you should have tolerance<br>  to pay heed to that guy. if you want reject say no to him. that is all.<br>  there is nothing wrong in rejecting the guy. or else you tell him that<br>  you are busy with friends and say that you will extend pleasantries <br>  as soon as possible after the brief discussion with friends are over.<br>  take it easy Yar. it life today you are here and tomorrow we cant say <br>  where we are .|`|KMtXVAPXaa	it is kinda embarrassing ...|`|WaJU9TTpaa	yes it is extremely awkwarddd|`|3sM4PS3yaa	Yeah but usually he hits on us as a group

He actually has this big scar on his chest from it. So they must have been working with Kyuubi's chakra as well.|`|5uYsApYbaa	well the main training was to control the kyubbi chakara and also how to escape genjutsu he also trained him to form a bigger rasengan, also he trained him to control hi chakara<br>  <br>  thats pretty much it but i think mostly it was the nine tails chakara coz that scar on pervy sage's chest was created coz of the nine tails fox's chakra

kyTBaYFlaa	you would probably want 88 keys like a piano, but more important than the number of keys is probably the size of the keys. you want full size keys so you can make the proper chord shapes and learn the correct distances between the octaves and the notes. you could learn with fewer keys than 88.

cr5TQgmUaa	I don't think she has been lying about everything. Bianca told Reese that she didn't want to know about her past. So as Reese's past started to come out Bianca accused her of lying because she didn't tell her about her past. How nuts is that?<br>  <br>  So Bianca's whole family has been down on Reese from the beginning and she's constantly needing to defend herself.  Reese took the "blame" for convincing Zach to be the "donor" but Bianca allowed herself to be impregnated.  <br>  <br>  Reese's only friend has been Zach. So after Kendell's wicked toast at the rehearsal dinner she got very drunk. When Zach was comforting her Zach kissed her and she kissed back. See the kiss on YouTube at the link below.<br>  <br>  I like Reese. I'm kind of not liking Bianca right now. She's been acting like a martyr since she got home.|`|ADBMrG87aa	Reese is a pretty woman but Awesome?  Maybe Reeses Pieces but not Bianca's wife Reese.  It was Zack who initiated the kiss but regardless of who kissed who; I don't really like Reese.  Reese is one very confused wishy washy untrustworthy character who thinks just saying sorry will wipe the slate clean.  She knew how everyone felt about her around Zack and yet she always seem to wind up in Zack's arms hugging, leaning and now kissing.  C'mon...Reese was a disaster waiting to happen and it did!  Because of her kiss, Greenlee is now presumed dead and Kendall wound up back in the ER and alot of people are feeling pain, grief, loss, etc including Bianca.   I love the actress Tamara Braun who plays Reese but I don't like the behavior of Reese.  Also because Bianca is the classic victim throughout the show; anyone who betrays her like Reese did will be viewed as a villian, sorry.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	she isn't trust worthy.

lpyWVR2oaa	It won't be right to say that any combo is 'bad' per say but you do have your good traits and challenges to overcome.<br>  <br>  On the plus side, this combo makes you very lively, sociable, outgoing and communicative. You generally have a zest for life (unless other chart indicators contradict this) and are the life of the party, so as to speak. It's your warmth and radiance that people take a liking to..can be too much of an attention seeker at times as well.<br>  <br>  On the downside, this combo could make you a tad bit self-absorbed and egoistical/self-centred, with a flair for the dramatic. You are also likely to be restless and fickle-minded, indecisive when it comes to emotional connections and can appear to be superficial to those around you. Also tends to get bored easily and has a tendency for change and variety (too much is not good of cos).|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	1-3 Aries/Gemini<br>  The combination of your Sun and Moon signs produces one of the most verbally active pairs in the Zodiac. You're likely to dominate any conversation as your mind works fast and releases the information it has processed just as fast. You have to learn to keep things to yourself at least until you've made up your mind, which you don't find easy to do. It is easier for you to make decisions by sitting down and talking things out rather than by closing yourself off, studying the issues and concentrating on the alternatives. Speaking before you think and jumping to conclusions can get you in deep trouble. Success will come easier for you after you have learned, and practice, the art of secrecy, clearly thinking things through before you charge off. This shortcoming notwithstanding, you are likely to get far in the world because of your quick wit and good intentions. Your debate skills allow you to back lesser opponents into the corner with relative ease. Surprisingly, as quick as you act, you have an especially good knack for details. In business, your command of facts and figures gives you the semblance of the perfect executive. Nonetheless, you're often guilty of a little oscillation and indecision stemming from too many superficial facts and too little depth of study. Anyhow, fluency of mind is your primary attribute. Your style of getting bits and pieces of information and using them in a glib and effective way can take far. You may aspire to become an executive. However, the hard decision making necessary here may not be as natural for you as a spot in advertising, the literary world, or in other areas where your outstanding business acumen focused on anything dealing with the spoken or written word can be employed. You should try to overcome a certain superficiality with respect to both intellectual and emotional matters. <br>  <br>  Aries/Leo Rising<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>              You are a dynamo of energy and may be very well coordinated as well. You're extremely ambitious and generally have substantial goals from an early age. You are adventurous, creative and a visionary. [The Errol Flynn type, if anybody remembers who he is.] You are a natural born leader and usually do that by example. You enjoy hard work. You have a charismatic personality and could be an incurable romantic, also a professional athlete. It's a sad commentary on Life TODAY, that the majority of society's role models are childish, rich and spoiled professional athletes.<br>  <br>              You have excellent management abilities and many creative ideas. Once headed in the correct direction, inertia can carry you on to success while you start to plan another venture. You are a good manager of your affairs and the affairs of others, too. You combine intuition with a clear vision and generally have no trouble achieving the goals you set.<br>  <br>              You are truly a social animal. You love people in general and are a proud, loyal friend, instinctively knowing that friends [for you in particular] and good family ties are the truly valuable possessions in Life. You like being noticed, the center of attention, and compliments.<br>  <br>              You have a strength of resolve and will, that few others on the planet possess. Your willpower may be the catalyst to you being very lucky or is it just instinctively being in the right place at the right time. Take your pick. You need to burn up all that energy with consistent vigorous activity and exercise.<br>  <br>              In love and relationships you are affectionate, loyal, passionate, sensuous and generally need to be the family leader. You like being in a loving union and it will be more so, if you give up being "in control" in this area. Besides it's more fun that way.|`|uD1S5dYtaa	Do you have a talent?  This is an excellent placement for an actress to be a star.  Or a singer?  You love attention and the limelight.  You are magnetic.  In your personal life, you love to be the center of attention, so be careful to concentrate on what other people say  and listen to them or else your charm will wear off quickly.

Luffy, inspired by his childhood hero "Red-Haired" Shanks, sets out on a journey to find the legendary One Piece, to become the new Pirate King. To accomplish this, he must reach the end of the most deadly and dangerous ocean: The Grand Line.<br>  Luffy captains the Straw Hat Pirates first through the sea of East Blue and then through the Grand Line. He follows the path of the deceased Pirate King, Gold Roger, from island to island on his way to the great treasure One Piece. On his way his crew grows to have a swordsman, a navigator, a sniper, a cook, a doctor, an archaeologist, a shipwright, and a musician.<br>  During the course of the story, the crew contend with both other less moral pirate crews and the Navy. The latter are the subordinates of the World Government, who apparently seek justice by ending the Golden Age of Pirates. Many background story elements involve the delicate balance of power between the World Government and the world's most powerful pirate crews.<br>  <br>  Bleach, in case you haven't watched it yet:<br>  The story opens with the sudden appearance of Soul Reaper Rukia Kuchiki in Ichigo Kurosaki's bedroom. She is surprised at his ability to see her, but their conversation is interrupted by the appearance of a "hollow", an evil spirit. After Rukia is severely wounded while trying to protect Ichigo, she attempts to transfer half her powers to Ichigo in order to let him face the hollow on equal footing. Ichigo instead unintentionally absorbs almost all her energy, allowing him to defeat the hollow with ease. The next day Rukia appears in Ichigo's classroom as a seemingly normal human, and informs Ichigo that his absorption of her powers has left her stranded in the human world until she recovers her strength. In the meantime Ichigo shelters Rukia in his home and takes over her job as a Soul Reaper, battling hollows and guiding lost souls to the afterlife realm known as Soul Society.<br>  After a few months of this arrangement, in the sixth volume of the series, Rukia's Soul Reaper superiors find out about her giving her powers away (which is illegal in Soul Society) and send a detachment to arrest her, and sentence her to death. Ichigo is unable to stop Rukia's capture, but with the help of several of his classmates who also possess spiritual abilities and ex-Soul Reaper and captain Kisuke Urahara, he sets off for the Soul Reaper base, located in Soul Society. Once there, Ichigo and company battle against the elites of the Soul Reaper military, and are ultimately successful in halting Rukia's execution.<br>  It is then revealed that Rukia's execution and Ichigo's rescue attempt were both manipulated by Sōsuke Aizen, a high ranking Soul Reaper previously believed to be murdered, as part of a far-reaching plot to take control of Soul Society. Aizen betrays his fellow Soul Reapers and allies himself with the hollows, becoming the main antagonist of the series, and Ichigo teams up with his former enemies in Soul Society after learning that the next step in Aizen's plan involves the destruction of his hometown. At this point, Bleach chronicles the war between Aizen and the Soul Society, a plotline which has not yet been resolved. According to Tite Kubo, the ending of the series is not yet planned out or written.<br>  <br>  Naruto/Naruto Shippuden:<br>  Naruto Uzumaki is a young boy who has the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox sealed within him. Twelve years before the start of the series, the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox attacked the ninja village Konohagakure, slaughtering many people. In response, the leader of Konohagakure – the Fourth Hokage – sacrificed his life to seal the demon inside Naruto when he was a newborn. Konohagakure, however, regarded Naruto as if he were the demon fox itself and mistreated him throughout most of his childhood. A decree made by the Third Hokage forbade anyone mention the attack of the demon fox to anyone. Years later, Naruto was tricked by the renegade ninja Mizuki into stealing a forbidden scroll, but was stopped by his teacher, Iruka Umino. That encounter made Naruto realize he was the container of the demon fox.<br>  The main story follows Naruto and his friends' personal growth. Naruto befriends two comrades, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, who are assigned with him to form a three-person team under an experienced sensei named Kakashi Hatake. Naruto also befriends other characters that he meets throughout the series. They learn new abilities, get to know each other and other villagers better, and experience a coming-of-age journey as Naruto dreams of becoming the Hokage of Konohagakure. At first, emphasis is placed on Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura, who are the members of Team 7. Later, Orochimaru, a criminal at the top of Konohagakure's most wanted list, attacks Konoha killing the Third Hokage as an act of revenge. This causes one of the three legendary ninja, Jiraiya to search for his partner Tsunade, to become the Fifth Hokage.

It requires a gospel voice which is a powerful and belting voice (belting is not necessary). It sound very trendy compared to gospel or ballads and has lots of backvocals. It is my favourite genre. It is danceable and powerful. It always has a beat going behind the song.<br>  If you want to hear more, listen to-<br>  Whitney Houston- Summertime,queen of the night. I'm every woman<br>  Misia- Royal chocolate flush, tsutsumikomu yoni<br>  <br>  The RnB begins when the beat starts. Misia is a japanese singer but she sings the classic RnB and to understand the genre I suggest you listen to the two songs I have listed above. RnB is basically a black invented genre like rap but it is a thousand times better than rap. Mariah Carey, Rihanna and Neyo also sing RnB but Whitney and Misia are the best since they have an amazing five octave range and sing the original RnB

FF9mMlgKaa	you don't, twilight was a clinker of a film|`|qXvFsnOcaa	You can't. It's as simple as that. There are ways of getting round proxy blocks, but Twilight is a full length movie and most of these ways are either too slow to allow you to do this (It would take all day) or they purposefully stop you from downloading files this large because you screw up the system for other people.<br>  <br>  UYou shouldn't even attempt to download Twilight in school. You will eat up the school's bandwidth and will spoil things for other people trying to use the Internet. the spike in data will also make you stand out a mile to the network administrator.

AA11485682	It's a movie musical that's a sexy parody of 1950s sci-fi films, about a boyfriend and girlfriend who end up meeting the transvestite mad scientist Dr. Frank N Furter, and learning more about sex and perversion than they ever could have dreamed.<br>  <br>  The main thing is that the movie is silly, and that people do things when watching them, like talk back to the characters, or pull out lighters during one of the songs, and some people will dress up as the characters and act out what they're doing in the film. It's silly, kinda sexy fun. Nothing bad, just naughty. <br>  <br>  It's not a great film, but I do recommend seeing it with a crowd at least once.

ZUxNThlAaa	Not all concerts have "backstage passes", sometimes bands are just available to hang out and sign things, etc after the show in general.  I've never seen Disturbed, so I wouldn't know if they do or not, but stick around and talk to other concert goers to find out more.  If they are doing the whole backstage pass thing, it might be a little late to find one (exclusive things like that are the first things to sell out-- sorry!).  Check out their website/myspace, Disturbed fan sites, or the venue's website to see if you can dig up anything.  Good luck, and have a great time!|`|AA10065759	There are ONLY THREE ways to get a backstage pass....<br>  <br>  1) You must know someone connected with the tour, more<br>  like a relative that works for the concert. Or, if you are lucky have<br>  a friend in school that has a relative that works for the concert.<br>  <br>  2) Be a news reporter. You would have to be one connected<br>  to your local newspaper or local news TV team.<br>  <br>  3) A local radio station will sometime have a backstage pass<br>  of the concert and offer it as a promotional prize.<br>  Either you have to be the 7th or 10th caller.<br>  Or answer the right question on the air.<br>  Or hope that the entry form you filled out gets picked out<br>  in a drawing.<br>  <br>  Those are the ONLY WAY you will get a backstage pass.<br>  <br>  - - - - - - - - - - - - -

BbiyBG0oaa	No, After Sasuke defeated his brother he fell unconscious and Madara Uchiha came and got him.  When Sasuke woke up he looked at Madara and suddenly his Mangekyo Sharingan was awakened because Itachi made it so when Sasuke first saw Madara it would awaken and destroy Madara so Madara wouldn't tell Sasuke the truth behind Itachi.  When Madara tells Sasuke the truth Madara tells him that he will give him 3 of the tails beasts if he defeats the 8 tails and brings him back alive.  After Sasuke does this his true intentions are revealed that he is going to destroy Konaha.  Although Sasuke fails to capture the 8 tails beasts he has to bring him back alive in order to pursue his attack on Konoha.

Plus she's the better vocalist.|`|uly3aFqtaa	[[In order]]<br>  <br>  <br>  Demi Lovato.<br>  Hannah Montana.<br>  Ashley Tisdale.<br>  Vanessa Hudgens.<br>  Miley Cyrus.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Vanessa took nudie photos, and Miley took ones of her showing her belly [mny times] and ones of her hooking up with someone on a bed, so they are LAST.<br>  I picked Demi First because she has a good head on her shoulders and keeps her Moral Standards up.<br>  Then I picked Hannah Montana because she's a character. I don't see ANY Miley Cyrus in Hannah, I see a Southern girl who loves entertaining fans and making enjoyable music for young girls.<br>  <br>  I don't really know much about Ashley Tisdale but I know she's not into Scandalous stuff, so she's OK.<br>  <br>  I liked Miley a couple of years ago, but I can definitely see that Fame is really getting to her. I liked her before she turned into a spoilt sk*nk. :(<br>  <br>  Xx.|`|F338culUaa	Vanessa Hudgens And Ashley Tisdale<-----  Singing And Acting<br>  <br>  Demi Lovato And Miley Cyrus/Hannah Montana <----- Singing|`|D0OCvExHaa	Vanessa awesome actress and awesome singer and style|`|H04o6RIRaa	Talentwise, they're pretty much all equal.  They all have talents and all have flaws<br>  <br>  Ashley's a pretty good actress, but she's not that good of a singer<br>  <br>  Miley's really funny on her show and she's a good entertainer on stage.  She can't sing that well live, but her shows are always fun to watch.<br>  <br>  Demi Lovato's got a pretty decent voice.<br>  <br>  and Vanessa, while's she's a boring actress, her voice is good in HSM.

3urpilpBaa	I think you have great tone and it sounds like you are working with some natural vibrato.  At 14 I think that is a great start.  Every single person can benefit from singing lessons and I know if you search youtube for "singing lessons" you can practice a bit for free.  My best advice is to not get discouraged if people do not like what they hear.  Everyone has an opinion, some people will love your sound, some will not.  Sing because you love it and sing for the people who love your sound.  Everyone else can go to hell.    Good luck!!!|`|FDt7cC8haa	You are right....You need help...lots of it...Your voice was terrible...what hell were you doing, the way the words came out was almost laughable...strong ? no...bad? yes|`|ltIuUBXNaa	Your vocal tone is good, you need to stop breathing after every word, try at the end of the phrase. You also sounded like you were trying to force the song. If you tried to sing a song meant for a female voice it might not have sounds as forced. You need to relax and use your natural voice. Don't try such a low voiced song, every time you were trying to get low it sounded bad, like you were trying to drop the octave of your voice, but it didn't want to go. My advice, listen to the song you want to try next, while listening pickup where the singer breathes. Try to copy it. Also go with something for a female alto-like Amy Grant(1st person I could think of). Singing lessons as always an excellent way of improving yourself.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	start singing and i'll let you know|`|rLCoX7TUaa	seriously man, take singing lessons it helps a load. i'm doing the same now and i'm 15. it's been 3 months almost and i've seen a big improvement.|`|37b306e9f3811e8d3f057cc4f3082ef9aa	you have a strong voice but your singing isnt that good keep practicing though and you will get it|`|rNdun1V7aa	it's ok, lil nasal, and you have to work on your breathing. if your serious about it ask your parents for some lessons. your voice isn't developed yet though. good luck.|`|HbmHRiwLaa	bloobity bloo blah!    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFFYIdslQ...|`|SH3wGEteaa	singing lessons|`|9xkFqLataa	you are bhutt keep practiceing         practice makes perfect|`|si91sAf0aa	i think you do have a strong voice..you just need practice..i agree with the person who commented on youtube...you kind of breathe a lot

QaJGkXp2aa	Genius is hard work in disguise. The kid probably has talent, but the only way to realize it is lots of practice. <br>  <br>  Growing up, my best friend had talent. His parents were very supportive. That made him feel good so he practiced a lot, worked hard, and now you've probably heard his work, although I'm not keen to name him here.<br>  <br>  My dad on the other hand discouraged me and so practicing always felt bad. I felt like I was bothering him just by picking up my instrument and he always did his best to make me feel his disapproval. I've forgiven him, but part of me will always resent him for it.<br>  <br>  Even now as an adult, I can intellectually understand what happened, but when I pick up my instrument, part of me is still that little boy who feels like he's bothering people with the sound. I'm sure I'm not the musician I might have been if I had grown up with a little more support.<br>  <br>  That kid's dad can still make it right if he wakes up to what he's really doing, but I'm guessing he's too much of a macho idiot for that. His kid will forever resent him for it, even if it's just on a subconscious level. Makes me sad.|`|xiuqFx2Naa	Clair de lune is a very difficult piece for piano, and also, and this is very important.<br>  <br>  Slow pieces aer the hardest.<br>  <br>  This is the absolute truth. Anyway can waffle through a fast fiddly bit and the audience will think "oh that's wonderful, well done" but you have to have real control and talent to be able to get the same reaction from slow music. You are completely exposed.<br>  <br>  Listen to the teacher, the father (unless he is a Professional pianist) knows less than the teacher, and should be told "well i'd like to see you do better" The fact is, the teacher knows whether a pupil has talent. Please tell this guy to take piano back up and ignore his father.|`|AA10506734	Claire de Lune is already a pretty advanced piece; for level 5 out of 8 levels. So is Mozart's Fantasia in D minor. Chopin sonatas are supposedly for level 6 students and above. Whoa! Piano students are already expected to be performing in concerts by level 5. <br>  <br>  I think he is VERY talented if he could manage to play those pieces already.<br>  <br>  HE'S A PRODIGY!<br>  <br>  That father... Tsk tsk... He has destroyed the hopes and aspiration of a rising great talent.<br>  <br>  KILL THE FATHER! (he-he. joke)<br>  <br>  I just do hope the kid continues what he has started. What a great loss in the world of music, where talented pianists are rare nowadays.|`|s2FbVQ3Oaa	=O<br>  The boy should PLAY!!<br>  He should listen to his teacher,because his father more than likely knows NOTHING about music,whereas his teacher obviously knows about music,considering they're TEACHING music.....<br>  If you know this boy,tell him to go back playing piano,and ignore his idiotic fathers comments,and glares.....|`|AXDBs6Dwaa	You can't let people take away your dreams so quickly.|`|uT8n10claa	His dad is right. The piano teacher just wants money.|`|CrAwmz65aa	Too bad that there is an instinctive tendency for children to believe everything their parents say.<br>  My parents underrated everything I did the whole time I was growing up.  And I believed them.<br>  <br>  I am giving points to all the other respondents, because we are all behind the teacher one hundred percent.|`|qWNdhGVXaa	the teacher knows what she is talking about, and the dad is an ******.  don't listen to him, just keep playing.  Maybe tell him you don't care if you have talent, you love piano and are going to keep playing it anyway|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	the teacher would be correct unless the father was some fantastically intellectual with the art of music then he would be the one to know. But, if that were the case then why would he need to send his kid to piano lessons. he would do it himself.|`|VrFcZnZSaa	that guys dad sucks... the teacher is right because the father doesn't even play the piano! so what does he know? very saddening... how parents doubt their teenagers so much...|`|ZAvV3WfLaa	Your teacher is right, your dad is just being mean!|`|jR8kyp0Taa	Being 15 and only being able to play slow movts from sonatas, well the kid has talent, for sure, but no where NEAR good enough to have any kind of future playing professionally. Having said this, one does NOT have to be a prodigy to enjoy playing the piano for oneself or for others. There are only a handful of people who have the kind of gift needed to play professionally. <br>  <br>  The father may feel like the son is not good enough to make the father famous. Or the father wants to live his fame and glory through his son. It's complete crap. I'd tell the father to shove a broomstick up his rear, and that he is an unfit father. How dare he? Tell him to get a life...or better yet, get his own hobby to work on, so he can quit worrying about what other people do.<br>  <br>  Boy Wonder<br>  <br>  EDIT: JBeethov..... for one to have the talent and gift needed to be a professional concert pianist, Claire de Lune should have already been learned and semi-mastered by age 10. A friend of mine who is going to release a solo album soon, learned the entire moonlight sonata at age 11. He is 23 now and mastering Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev concertos. <br>  <br>  I'm not trying to take away anything from the asker, or the subject of the asker, I would encourage him to keep playing as long as he wants to. I, myself, am 26 and can't even play the 1st movt of "Moonlight" Sonata. I took piano lessons for 3 years when I was 10 but just never took off. I switched to trumpet in 7th grade and REALLY took off.  <br>  Different talents for different people.

ctYCzvG1aa	This was a hard one Mr. Dude Vinster...  After tossing a coin in my head I was forced to settle on "Braveheart!"  Now to the "Why"..    Being a direct descendant of Robert the Bruce, his playing of Wallace tended to take on a more personal aspect to me.  I don't think any other actor could have taken the role, & pulled the true historical person, & persona forward into the character as Mel Gibson did.  (I don't give a rat's **** if he wore plaid before its time!).  Thru him I felt as if I was actually walking/living in the steps of those times in Scotland.  Going thru their strife,  suffering their poverty, seeking their independence from the harsh British to be able to live as they chose to live.    Whether it was from the damp peat fires, the cold wet moors, the cold Highlands, the Lochs, to the blood running like rivers on the battle fields, seeing it thru the character presented to me by Mel Gibson, brought it all to life!  Yet at times, his sense of natural humor & wit were allowed to come through.  Though, there wasn't much in this character's, or those of any Scotsmen/women, during the reign of the British to be happy about.    Though there were some hard-nosed, snobbish, know-it-all, but really know-not-much-of-anything-except-their-o...  Historians who griped, & tried to bring the movie down as to its being, "Historically Inaccurate!"  They failed  to realize that nowhere in the advertising, in the film itself, by the actors, or anywhere, or by anyone else did it ever state the Movie was in fact EXACTLY historically accurate.  It was a movie made on the lives of people who had lived & died making marks on their times!|`|F2ugW4cRaa	All of his Mad Max movies, because they are quite funny.|`|7auG8Sqxaa	Signs.  They say one of the hardest roles to play is a parent,(and pole it off well of course).|`|AA10053661	I have to agree with the person above. It is rather difficult to top his performance in "Braveheart." Primarily because we got to see so many levels of his ability as an actor. His strength, his passion, his anger, his drive and motivation. The sacrifice and bravery that he gave to his character was beyond reproach. I feel he portrayed this just as well in "The Patriot" (another of my true favorites). But when it comes down to choices.......... "Braveheart" wins!    (mel Gibson was in Pulp Fiction????)|`|PpWosZsIaa	Lethal Weapon Series and Mad Max Series.|`|e00dff88dc30b4a7021797a2956952d6aa	absolutely everything he does.

It's not entirely about him, but his scenes are great.|`|1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	Braveheart - Because i'll love that movie forever. It's great, and so inspirational. It's what a movie should be, and it's possibly the greatest love/war movie of all time.    When they slit Murron's throat, I get all teary eyed. But then when William Wallace starts tearing the english a new butthole in her name, then i get all excited.    "EVERY MAN DIES, NOT EVERY MAN REALLY LIVES".|`|btrMdy5Uaa	I really liked Forever Young and The Man Without a Face, because they weren't action films and you really got to see him as an actor      the reason I didn't say Braveheart is because thats probably where everyone else is going to go, although I liked that movie as well|`|PRg9UgOlaa	Braveheart.

DUH9gJa1aa	Spinach is high in iron -- but you're not likely to absorb very much of the iron in what you eat. Iron is good for you. (It shows by making your blood a darker red.) When you have more iron in your blood, your blood can transport more oxygen. Oxygen is very useful stuff. Without it, your muscles (and brain) can't do much. That's why Popeye was expected to be very strong from eating spinach. (Some of the result would be the placebo effect -- when people expect something to help them, they perform better even if the 'something' is just water!)<br>  <br>  There is also iron in 'red' meats -- meat from animals rather than the flesh of birds and fish. Eating brocolli or spinach (or silverbeet) when you eat meat helps you absorb the iron in your food.<br>  <br>  You can also do your health a favour by getting enough sleep.

I think they are both smart enough to know that a duet love song WILL NOT be enough to make people forget this.

6mqAuBdFaa	I think you will have a harder time finding people who don't have complaints about Dragonball GT.  Even someone like me, who has set down & really looked for the good points of the show, can admit that the bad outweighs any good that may have come from this foray into Dragonball minus Toriyama.  I think the writers came up with some decent concepts for selling video games (some of the characters are fun to play on the Budokai games), but they started out trying to go back to the campiness of the original Dragonball, & DBZ fans had grown used to being served heaping helpings of action.<br>  <br>  On a side note, do you really think it could be more gay than Pokemon?  I mean seriously, it's hard to top the idiotic bad guys on Pokemon that attempt to terrorize their foes by announcing their presence with freaking nursery rhymes!  I tried to sit through some of this with my nephew, & had to divert him into playing outside!  I think the only thing I have ever seen more gay was Sailor Moon.|`|hJNdW5rjaa	I agree, the reason that dragonball gt sucked so hard was because it wasn't based off the manga like dragonball/z. so they made their own story, it was more of a filler than the actuall show, and fillers always suck.|`|BbiyBG0oaa	I absolutely think Dragonball GT was retarded.  It was created by someone other than akira toriyama which is way it was so incredibly bad.  Not to mention I thought that super saiyan 4 was a let down because it just didnt really make any sense at all.  I thought it was lame because the only person who had the power to defeat anyone was Goku, which in Dragonball Z you see that Gohan, Geten,  Vegeta, Trunks, and Piccolo all contribute more and more as the show progresses.  You don't see anyone overcome any obstacles at all, for instance you see Goku become a Super Saiyan 4, and you see Vegeta only become a Super Saiyan 4 once due to Brute Ray.  What about Gohan, Trunks, and Goten?  You don't even see Trunks and Goten fuse in GT which is how they first became a Super Saiyan 3.  And Gohan always seems to progress due to his anger in Dragonball Z but in GT his a little ***** and looks like a nerd and is extremely weak.  So ya I completely agree with you that it was a huge dissapointment.|`|iWXQH1Jeaa	It was bad because it was all filler.|`|iq7ZHua6aa	I think Dragon Ball Z was too good, that's why GT didn't seem that good.|`|1BKdwrvuaa	I agree.<br>  <br>  But Its technically not related to the DBZ series (thank god).<br>  <br>  I hated GT. It just sucked all round.<br>  The characters looked gay.<br>  They screwed up all the music and emotion that was in DBZ.<br>  And the fights were crap.<br>  <br>  But i thought SSJ4 Goku was SEXY, LOL.|`|XKhNw221aa	I don't know about gayer than Poke'crap but it did suck the DB series down. I just hope than don't do it again with the movie. From the previews though, my hopes are not high.|`|knKVjOE6aa	I don't see why they couldn't stop at DBZ I think it was a waste of time introducing another series.|`|TQge2oBVaa	I think people take it too far. Your reasons for not liking it are were put in the show because that is how things would have gotten if nobody had attacked the earth for that long. Think about it. <br>  <br>  The thing I didn't like about it was the fact that every fight was the same thing, and it was too short. Every fight was like 10 episodes if not less, and it always consisted of Goku fighting. Then he loses. Pan goes crazy and attacks the enemy and almost dies. Then Goku defeats them. The only one that was remotely different was super 17, but not by much. I still liked it, but it paled in comparison to Dragon Ball, or DBZ. And the original episodes of pokemon weren't THAT bad. Anything past those definitaly is, but the originals weren't horrible.

He has always been kind and helpful and had many friends that took profit. Every time a friend borrowed him money he had big difficulties to have the money back. And sometimes he never did.<br>  <br>  Now he is acting with you as if nothing happened because he forgot about it and he expect you to do the same.<br>  <br>  *They are full of hope and enthusiasm, and crash after crash produces no effect.  They are apt to be careless about money matters, and this is often due to their extreme aversion to the financial part of any transaction.

Y63Q4bnOaa	I think there are lots of friendly Canadians and lots of friendly Americans. People just have too many false stereotypes.

AA10506734	Classical music refers to the music during the classical period (which probably started in 1700's to 1827, the year Beethoven died). The center of this music is at Vienna, Austria. Listening to Haydn, Mozart, or Beethoven can enlighten you on what classical music really is.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, Bahia music, though probably has music which spanned during the classical period, cannot be considered "classical" because it is not of European origin. It does not sound European at all!<br>  <br>  It can be more properly classified as "ethnic" or "folk" .<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!<br>  <br>  God Bless!|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Clasical music is NOT the sole preserve of Western Art music....there are classical periods in most "ethnic musics"....I don't really like Ethnic as a term as it derives from ethinikos, greek for heathen!<br>  <br>  These "other" classical periods do not necessarily co-incide with the European mid-18th century Classical period of orchestral music.Organ music in European tradition sites its classical period a little earlier in the time of Bach late 16th-early 17C<br>  <br>  Indian classical music comes from a far older tradition than western art music, similarly with Persian classical music. the saaghe namhe songs of the persian classical period being amongst some of my favourites.|`|T5DbLLgQaa	No, it is not. I would call it "folk" music or "ethnic" music instead. The term "classical" refers to Mozart, Bach, H?ndel and other music like that.|`|ThKkn5fKaa	Woah.  The thumbs down brigade is out in full force today.<br>  <br>  The problem is that what we commonly refer to as classical music is actually called "Western Art" music, and "classical" actually only refers to a period of time within the history of western art music.<br>  <br>  I also dislike the use of the term "ethnic" because it is a very ethnocentric word.  Music that sounds "ethnic" to us westerners is very much not ethnic to those who have grown up with it as a part of their culture.  Thus, you should look at how the music fits in with the culture.  Unlike our classical music, I wouldn't consider Bahia to be a type of "art music".    Art music implies the concept of music designed to be complex and intellectual.  It is music for the sake of music.  Instead, I'd call it folk music because it is much more ingrained into the culture.|`|rNqF4gIVaa	You are joking, right? It is not even remotely connected to classical music.
YNuyXl1waa	Ignore all of those pikers.<br>  <br>  Stock footage of childbirths (often in hospital operating rooms) is often used for birth scenes in TV shows and movies...such footage is often acquired from sources like Oxford Scientific Films, Encyclopedia Britannica, Discovery Communications and medical training media companies.|`|up676wNwaa	They just get stale babies and spritz them up with evian spray.|`|AA11485682	They fake it with older babies.
CHCPnvksaa	Um..i don't know! Just kidding. I would say Simmons and Stanley are both leaders because they originally co-formed the band Wicked Lester, then they met Ace Frehley from the band Lips and formed Kiss.|`|PtRmhxU9aa	Paul and Gene are regarded as co-founders. They came from a band called Wicked Lester in '71. Paul came up with the name, and is the usual lead vocalist, but I don't think they have ever named an official "leader."|`|IivNGj0Maa	Paul Stanley is lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Gene Simmons is vocals and bass guitar.

fLASTynLaa	it's worth watching! =)  If you like it, i also recommend watching Miyazaki's other films.     Howl's Moving Castle  Catle In The Sky  Kiki's Delivery Service  Nausicaa.  And many more...|`|44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	It is a fantastic film. I think it's better watching it with subtitles because the American voices are horrible.|`|E3Lheqoeaa	It's one of my favorite movies so I'd recommend it. :)|`|GHObdosFaa	anime movie, not cartoon and you'll love it :)|`|f19c6b86d197d3010bff8fac6661f542aa	it's a wonderful movie. Give it a try!  Expect something a little different.|`|2B8Ecikjaa	yeah but of Miyazaki's films, Princess Mononoke is the best.|`|AA11531880	Yes, it is definitely worth watching, there's a reason that it's won so many awards. It has that thing that makes movies memorable.    Adults and children alike will love it.   personally it's one of my favorite movies.  you should watch it.
MXjvZMUXaa	What Skybaby said.|`|687xtC3zaa	Some people are homophobic.|`|tLLts6HFaa	some people are homophobic and closed minded and cant accept others for who they are!!!!|`|gERaZGZeaa	It's the musical equivalent of some stupid teenager saying "I'm bisexual" to get attention from people.  It's bland, it's insulting, it's derivative, and it's just an attention grabber.  They're some of the worst lyrics I've heard, because all it is, is "Look at me look at me look at me!!!"    Edit:  "some people are homophobic and closed minded and cant accept others for who they are!!!!"    You're dumb if you think the song is about homosexual acceptance.
BJIo6twUaa	Because of the way you put this, people that like twlight only...be ready for a lot of people that dont. A lot of them are tired of seeing the same questions over and over.    As for breaking dawn, as been posted several other times, its a wait and see kinda thing if they will do it. depends on if they make money or have funding for it. A lot of shows lately that are post to have more in the series is getting canned because they lost funding from the source or delayed the movie due to trying to find someone else to fund it.|`|G9sd4Nlkaa	It really depends on how much the next two movies gross. Summit Entertainment only has the rights to the first three movies as of now. And if they do make Breaking Dawn into a film, it will most likely be two movies seeing as the book is so long to begin with, which only adds to everything. If they get enough money to make one part of the Breaking Dawn movie, they won't make it at all seeing as they most likely won't make enough money to create the second half.     It's really just a thing that you have to play by ear. No one can say for sure whether or not the movie will be made at all. My fingers are crossed.|`|QxudUbGvaa	Is it actualllllly a good boook? I though about reading it but the whole vampire thing turned me off...|`|eEN9bkgQaa	I really hope they do film breaking dawn. And the denial vampires should be in it because they make up a big part of it.|`|551d897f0abf6a9c090f9e8bea28b76daa	It all depends on how the next Twilight film goes I think...I thought the first film was far from what they could have done with it and they didn't touch on a lot of the parts that were pretty huge in the book...I am glad to hear that there is going to be a new director for the next movie so we shall see how it turns out...As I haven't fully finished Breaking Dawn (I was reading it right before I came on here) I do not know what the Denali Vampires have done in the book but from what my mother says they pulled it from librarys because its pretty gruesome...You never know though I think they should stick as closely to the book as possible and not take out too many major parts...I think again who they choose to play Carmen will depend on how well the first two do (if they don't finish the movies with just two movies) because that will depend on how much they can budget for the film....I liked most if not all the people who played in Twilight were not known actors and actresses (at least not to me) it made the story feel more real than to look at the screen going "oh I remember him in such and such movie" Just my own opinion...I wish there was more books after I finish this one...I think thats what is taking me so long to read this one because I don't want it to be over yet :)|`|SrowuAGFaa	So far, I haven't seen that they are going to do Breaking Dawn.  They only have the first three books in the movies in contract...as far as I know of.  Hopefully they will make a contract for Breaking Dawn too!  I have no idea who is going to play Carmen...if they do decide to do Breaking Dawn we will see.|`|1XbN6wbdaa	Summit Entertaniment only has the rights to the first three books. It all depends on how much money the next two movies do and if the rights will be sold to the current studio.    Aside from that, Breaking Dawn would be a difficult movie to make or should I say to make it faithful to the book. It would have to be rated R for many obvious reasons (if you've read the book). But will have to wait.  As for the Denali clan, that depends if there not cut out from the other movies, although they are a critical part of the last book, to create the last dilema of the series.    New Moon should make more money that Twilight since their are many new fans of the series in just the last couple of months.    But who know's...just my 0.02|`|Yh7GOkZHaa	I think they will make Breaking Dawn if New Moon and Eclipse are a success, but its hard 2 say because New Moon has not even been released yet. I think the Denali clan will be part of it, but like I said its hard to say.
