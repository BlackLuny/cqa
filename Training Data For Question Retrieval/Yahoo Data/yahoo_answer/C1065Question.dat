Which would be a better gun for me to get the Springfield XD Pistol 9810HCSP06 Black DA 9 MM, or Glock 26???

20090128214605AAnyBrs	Sports;Football (Soccer);Mexican Football (Soccer)	Is Sven looking as stupid as Hugo Sanchez right now?	there is a few things i dont get about his tactics      Martinez, Leandro, Pardo, Ayala, all in the same midfield. Ayala was playing in the right and not his natural position, but it is understandable as Medina played in the right and it provided for more "proyeccion" as we like to call it in spanish and Ayala was covering for him. In the left we have Pinto as a left back. He plays great on the wing, but he puts Leandro in the left. Leandro blocked Pinto's salida all the time. It wasnt til the second half when leandro moved to the middle that Pinto played more on the wing. Not to mention Pinto hasnt even been starting for Cruz Azul so maybe Edgar Castillo would have been a better choice. What do you think?

Also looking for something that will be smooth on the throttle. I hear some sport bikes get be a bit twitchy as they build RPM's.  No I am not interested in a 250cc or 500cc. I have heard all the safe riders saying start out small, I have driven fast things all my life, I am old enough to respect them. If I eat it, it better be in a blaze I never come back from, lol.    Last but not least how many years can I go back and still have a decent bike. Kinda want to stay below $5K. One more thing, I see so many salvage titled bikes out there. Are they even worth the look? I would never trust a car salvage titled, but I know bikes get totaled by insurance companies so easily.

20090128214520AANmXN8	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	Could you kill a person for personel gain? Best answer gets ten points. ?	I will give you several scenarios. First scenario: you are behind a .50 bmg staring through your scope at a person over a mile away and they are in your crosshairs. The only things you know are that you don't know if this is a bad person or a good person in a bad situation and that you were paid $500,000 before and if you kill him you get another $500,000. Also if you don't kill him there is a good chance of your employer seeking his $500,000. Scenario two: you are in a club in a hallway staring at the back of a mans head through the sights of your silenced pistol. Would you pull the trigger? You know the exact same things as in scenario one. Scenario three: after a recent "hit" in the bad part of town you find out that the late target was the leader of a large powerful gang. The gang is now coming after you as they have indentified you as the killer of there boss. Could you kill them? This time you know that if you don't kill them they will kill you, you can't go to the cops because you are an assasin, and they are bad people. Only one more scenario so hang in there. Scenario four: you have planted a remotely detonated bomb underneath a platform that your target will be speaking on in front of a large crowd. Could you detonate the bomb. You do not know who the speaker is or if they deserve being killed you do know that the bomb is large enough that there will be hundreds of wounded civilians and you are being paid 1.5 million if you succesfully kill you target. Thank you for answering. I know that this is really long.       P.S.    Remember that the sniper scope in scenario one zooms close enough for you to clearly see the persons face and remember it forever.

Realistically, which gear and cadence I have to maintain to keep up with Yin on a light-traffic single carriageway with a speed limit of 80 km/h?    I have changed my crank set to the Ultegra 50/34; combine with a 12-25 cassette.   The bike shop is saying that the smaller crank set will be more suitable for petite female riders.      I merely weight 48 kg, so I get blown around during windy condition.   I usually ride in the range of 80 to 90 rpm and try to stay on a 50/14, all the way to work.  However, on my return trip, I often had to hammer on a 50/13 to try to keep up with Yins cars.  I tried to push a 50/12, but I get the burn and end up dropping to a 50/14.      Starting next week, I will be riding a much longer route.  While Yin made a bet that on the day that I could not keep up with her, I will have to do all the chores.  Meanwhile, I could not break the 90 rpm barrier.

I'm wondering how should I respond to this annoyance since it only happens about once a week (whey they don't have to work the next day). But it's really loud. This young couple next door have sex around 2am. They seem not to care when they make noise, and it gets unberable. It's usually not their voice or whatever, but the banging noise that come from the bed hitting the wall. It's sounds like someone hammering the nail...   Lickyly our bedroom does not share the same wall with this neighbor's bedroom, but this time a friend of mine is visiting and sleeping on the couch. I feel terrible to have him experience this.    What should I do?   I thought about the following options..   1) put an annonymous memo (saying your banging is too loud)   2) tell manager to see what they can do (I usually can't do much)   3)?      Thanks for your opinions!

Symonds was talking about McCullum's signing to play for New South Wales in the domestic Twenty20 final when he said: "They're trying to use him [McCullum] as the out because he's a Kiwi. Yep, we love to hate them, but he's the lump of s..., sorry, lump of cow dirt, that people are thinking of." Symonds had been drinking before the interview but made his grade comeback the following day.    What do you think about this. Should Symonds be allowed to play for Australia if he continues this insane behaviour?

I know you can obviously pump air into the HPA tank with a heavy duty hand pump, but is it also OK to pump compressed air into a CO2 tank?

20090128220604AA894T9	Sports;Football (American)	Who is the top contender in the AFC and NFC 2009-10?	I have the Patriots in the AFC with Brady back and the Eagles in the NFC as I'm sure next year is their last ditch effort with Dawkins and Westbrook who are not getting any younger. Who do you see making the playoffs. Keep in mind I don't think this is who will go to the SB.      AFC   North-Steelers 11-5 are always consistently good they have great management and they know how to draft and awesome D.   East-Patriots 13-3 with Brady back they should be good again like 13-3 good or somewhere along those lines.   West-Chargers 11-5 they have Merriman back and he covered up the holes on their defense and they will add solid players via draft and FA.   South-Jaguars 11-5 they will fix their O line and defense and MJD will have his 1st 1000+ season carrying most of the work load.    WC-Ravens 10-6 Flacco will improve with another season   WC-Titans-10-6 The defense will get them here once again         NFC   North-Packers 10-6 they will be healthy on defense which should let them win the North and Rodgers will have more experience.   East-Eagles 12-4 they will be like the Eagles of old and they know what they missed out on in the loss to the Cardinals a really solid team with depth on defense.   South-Saints 11-5 I think they can improve their defense enough to not be a liability in games.   West-Cardinals 10-6-They will resign their FAs and draft well and Warner should be back.   WC-Cowboys 11-5- They are talented and rid themselves of one bad seed already.   WC-Giants 10-6-No Plax=less wins for Eli as no one will catch his overthrown balls. The defense and running game will get them a WC.

20090128213127AAoEzBq	Sports;Golf	I am buying a new driver. ?	I like the Nike sumo2 5900,  square head will take some getting used to but it seems very forgiving. I also hit the taylor made r7 (the one that's been out a couple of years) I don't remember which one it was but it had adjustments on the back. I liked the r7 it felt like it had good contact.  I had more contact with the center of the nike driver.  On the r7 I was hitting a little low on the face.  But that can be easily fixed with practice.  I need to know which driver would you recommend?  I have been playing for 1 1/2 years steadily so I am a beginner.  I also like the r7 burner 460.

20090129033220AAmbaWF	Sports;Football (Soccer);Other - Soccer	What do you think about the 2018 World Cup bid situation? And, importantly, who do you think will win?	At the current time there are confirmed bids from:   England   Spain & Portugal   Holland & Belgium   Russia   Qatar   Indonesia   WIth bids expected from:   Canada   USA   Mexico   Australia   China   Japan      The bids will be for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. I personally see the 2018 bid being held in Europe. Both 2010 (SA) and 2014 (Brazil) under the now scrapped confederation rotation policy could be seen by FIFA as risks- Europe will be seen as a reliable decision.   I think the Spain/Portugal bid holds a lot of clout, however there is a possibility that FIFA voters may be put off by a joint bid (Japan/S.Korea wasn't looked upon with so much love and affection). Also, they're two footballing mad nations and already have an infrastructure in place, in both in terms of coping with an influx of supporters on their country, and also in terms of footballing infrastructure too- the necessary stadia are in place.   And the same can be said about England too- however will England we looked upon with scepticism?   Russia, in terms of hosting the biggest showcase on earth, looks far behind- could be fair to say only 2 cities (Moscow and St. Petersberg) could cope with stresses of a World Cup. Travelling distances could also be an issue. But, as you may or may not know, Russia pulled out a white rabbit that was the 2014 winter Olympics from the hat that was the IOC in getting Sochi to play host- so you never know!   Holland and Belgium: Held a successful Euro 2000 however may struggle as the footballing criteria isn't met yet and work would have to be done to meet FIFA spec.
