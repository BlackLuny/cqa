The Panda is not very good at reproduction and so they are dieing faster than the are born.|`|FoUOqSh5aa	cause ppl kill them for their fur...<br>  its messed up|`|MI0MIAfaaa	The biggest reason they are endangered is habitat destruction.  Pandas eat bamboo, which grows in specific areas of China.  Humans have caused the Panda's habitat to become fragmented.  This means there are only small patches of land suitable for Pandas and they are so far apart that the Pandas don't move between them.<br>  compare their original distribution to their current distribution: <a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/finder/giantpanda/WWFImgFullitem8113.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/fin...</a><br>  <br>  Another issue is poaching.  Pandas are being hunted illegally, which further threatens their population.|`|vVkVkIXRaa	Because people hunt them for profit.  Reguardless of law and sheer moral ethics of the nature.  Same with tigers and many other animals.  Also, because Pandas can only have one child at a time.

They said that panda mothers are terrible mothers.  Often they kill their babies accidentally because they're not careful and roll over onto them.  Also, their hormones don't make them want to mate when they're fertile. <br>  <br>  Also, their food, bamboo, is very low in nutrition, so it's easy for them to become malnourished.|`|crfWDksCaa	Your best source should be google or wikipedia<br>  <br>  For the main the pandas are endangered due to loss of habitat. The loss has come about as more and more of the areas where they live have been turned into agricultural lands, and their forests have been cut down.

YPtNr2O6aa	Getting a wind turbine with enough energy generation to power a house and shop is very pricey - getting a turbine that generates 33,000 KWh anually (about 90KWh a day at peak performance) costs in the region of ￡20,000 (prob around $35,000) not including installation which itself is typically around ￡8000 ($14,000 ish).prices will always vary slightly job to job because of many different variables such as location etc.. If you get a turbine it'll have to be supplemental if you want to keep costs to a more reasonable level.<br>  <br>  Also, a wind turbine like that would be very large, anywhere between 15-18 metres high and an 8 metre blade diameter.<br>  <br>  As for maintenence costs, it varies significantly - some measure it at around 1-2% of the original investment per year. Others place it at around 0.01USD per KWh generated which places the maintenence costs of a generator of the size you mentioned at around $330 a year, barring any major accidents happening of course.<br>  <br>  any wind turbine costing arounf the $200-$600 is going to generate around 500KWh anually or about 1.5 daily.|`|npBCankMaa	depends on the wind in your area.  typically you will 3 need a unit rated at 3 times your peak.

If you need to have the power all the time, add in another $20,000 for batteries.|`|30ad4662919fe0039d27aaea1639ebe5aa	About 2 weeks ago  I seen an article in the newspaper a farmer was installing wind generator for $100,000 The state was giving him A tax credit of $68,000  I think.

4c54zUjuaa	The honeybees are disappearing due to a phenomenon called Colony Collapse Disorder. It is still not clear what is causing it, but harvesting honey it almost certainly not the problem. Honey may get more expensive, but there's no reason not to buy it.|`|a17766dad56e7d236a0a1f8b1237f3b2aa	Buying honey will only help.Farmers and orchard owners set out hives to pollinate their vegetation. They don't take enough honey to hurt the hive. Remember that they have to pay for the bees , they surely don't want them to die. bees are dieing due to a bee mite that infests the hive. So buying honey will keep the farmer harvesting it and keep in in the bee business and also trying to solve the mite problem. Without bees the world will go hungry due to no vegetation.|`|11c68addf98ac25ad97c5f2fa51e4491aa	Bees make more honey than they need.  As long as they have enough honey to survive the winter (and I'm sure the farmers don't starve their bees!), harvesting the excess honey shouldn't be a problem.  Enjoy!|`|0RSR1FYCaa	Sure, buy honey.

7ZeT3Krkaa	Using the wind to produce electricity in large quantities is a fairly new concept.  Using the wind for power has been around as long as boats first used a sail to move it through the water.<br>  Going Green is right that it will not become dominant because it is unpredictable.  The problem with some of the others becoming major sources of power is the same.  I live in the northern latitudes, where we get a lot of cloudy weather. We could not depend on solar as our main source of energy.  There are a lot of days the wind is not blowing at all, especially in the summer.  There are some places trying geothermal, but they have to go down so far to find the necessary heat, that the cost is too high to be practical.<br>  There are no quick and easy solutions to the problem of alternatives to fossil fuels, and there won't be any time soon.|`|2qQPBDlkaa	wind energy is the ultimate form of planet suicide...<br>  <br>  wind is used by the planet for reasons we do not understand.. so in our ultimate simplicity we have decided it is the perfect energy source.. we should suck as much of it up as we can... without any understanding of what it is.. or how it is used....<br>  <br>  <br>  the bad part is usually when we do this we <mankind> only figureres out what it was used for to late.|`|crfWDksCaa	Wind energy is just one of several options for what is known as alternative energy - alternative to fossil fuels.<br>  <br>  Wind can never become dominant as there are too many places where wind energy can't be produced (because there is no steady wind).<br>  <br>  Other options are solar power, biomass energy, water energy (but not hydro-electric).<br>  <br>  It's never the technology that shapes us, but rather what we allow technology to do to us. <br>  <br>  So will wind dominate. No.<br>  Will alternative renewable energy dominate. I sure hope so.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	It's a tax boondoggle - a way for "connected" guys to get into your wallet by government force.<br>  Look.

I'm a hunter, and without hunters that hunt responsibly, populations of wildlife would grow rampant and the death tole would be must larger due to the fight for food and getting struck by cars on the road. I respect the outdoors, animals, etc. If that logic and mindset made any sense, then I wouldn't wanna breathe so I don't take all the animals oxygen. I'm in full support for saving the environment and species living there, but I wouldn't choose to kill my family or friends or friends of friends or friends of family before I kill an animal. Thats what that question says to me. That you value an organism without our same capabilities, emotions, and duties/responsiblities that humans have.|`|WpAtF0MCaa	lol defineately more then some people woo!!
