DRlKeTLZaa	*<br>  <br>  [edit] Genetic determination of eye colour<br>  <br>  Eye colors can range from the most common colour, brown, to the least common, green. Rare genetic specialties can even lead to unusual eye colours: black, red, and violet. Eye color is an inherited trait influenced by more than one gene.[7][8] These genes are being sought using associations to small changes in the genes themselves and in neighboring genes. These changes are known as single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs. The actual number of genes that contribute to eye color is currently unknown, but there are a few likely candidates.<br>  <br>  The gene OCA2 (OMIM: 203200<br>   <br>  ), when in a variant form the gene causes the pink eye color and hypopigmentation common in human albinism, (the name of the gene is derived from the disorder it causes, oculocutaneous albinism type II). Different SNPs within OCA2 are strongly associated with blue and green eyes as well as variations in freckling, mole counts, hair and skin tone. The polymorphisms may be in an OCA2 regulatory sequence, where they may influence the expression of the gene product, which in turn affects pigmentation.[9] A specific mutation within the HERC2 gene, a gene that regulates OCA2 expression, is partly responsible for blue eyes.[10] Other genes implicated in eye color variation are: SLC24A4,[11] TYR.[11]<br>  <br>  Blue eyes with a brown spot, green eyes and gray eyes are caused by an entirely different part of the genome. As Eiberg said: "The SNP rs12913832 [of theHerc2 gene] is found to be associated with the brown and blue eye color, but this single DNA variation cannot explain all the brown eye color variation from dark brown over hazel to blue eyes with brown spots".<br>  <br>  [edit] Synopsis<br>  Schematic representation of different eye colors resulting from different conditions in the iris.[12]<br>  <br>  [edit] Classification of colors<br>  The perception of color depends upon various factors. These are the same eyes; however, depending on the light and surrounding hues, the eye color can appear quite different.<br>  <br>  Iris color can provide a large amount of information about an individual and a classification of various colors may be useful in documenting pathological changes or determining how a person may respond to various ocular pharmaceuticals.[13] Various classification systems have ranged from a basic "light" or "dark" description to detailed gradings employing photographic standards for comparison.[13] Others have attempted to set objective standards of color comparison.[14]<br>  <br>  As the perception of color is dependent on viewing conditions (e.g. the amount and type of illumination, as well as the hue of the surrounding environment), so is the perception of eye color.[15]<br>  <br>  Eye color exists on a continuum from the darkest shades of brown to the lightest shades of blue.[7] Seeing the need for a standardized classification system that was simple, yet detailed enough for research purposes, Seddon et al developed a graded one based on the predominant iris color and the amount of brown or yellow pigment present. There are 3 true colors in the eyes that determine the outward appearance; brown, yellow, and blue. How much of each color one has determines the appearance of the eye color. The color of the eyes in turn depends on how much of these colors are present. For example, green eyes have blue and some yellow , making them appear green. Brown eyes appear brown because most of the eye contains the brown color. The above is true for Homo sapiens; the iris color can vary in the animal world. Instead of blue in humans, autosomal recessive color in the species Corucia zebrata is black, whereas the autosomal dominant color is yellow-green.[16]<br>  <br>  [edit] Eye color chart (Martin-Schultz scale)<br>  <br>  Carleton Coon created this chart by the Martin-Schultz scale often used in physical anthropology.<br>  <br>  I. LIGHT EYES:<br>  <br>      * light – blue, gray, green.<br>      * light-mixed:<br>  <br>  a) very light-mixed (blue with gray or green or green with gray), b) light-mixed (light or very light-mixed with small admixture of brown pigment). Eyes light and light mixed are in 16-12 in Martin scale.<br>  <br>  II. MIXED EYES:<br>  <br>      * mixed – [12-6 in Martin scale] mixture of light eyes (blue, gray or green) with brown pigment when light and brown pigment are the same level. Some of mixed eyes are accept to light-pigment eyes.<br>  <br>  III. DARK EYES:<br>  <br>      * dark-mixed - (hazel) [6-4 in Martin scale] brown with small admixture of light pigment.<br>      * dark – [4-1 in Martin scale] brown (light brown and dark brown) and very dark brown (black).<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Amber<br>  Human amber eyes displaying the yellow pigments.<br>  <br>  Amber eyes are of a solid color and have a strong yellowish/golden and russet/coppery tint. This might be due to the deposition of the yellow pigment called "lipochrome" in the iris (which is also found in green and violet eyes).[17][18].

I believe brown is dominant, while light(blue) is recessive..If you are homozygous dom for brown and you mate with a whole family of light(blue) eyes, then your kids would have brown but your grandchildren would have 75% brown and 25% light(blue). But if you are heterozygous, then you have a 50/50 chance of producing light(blue) eyes in your children.

But since he/she would still need a second one, you would have to have this recessive gene. <br>  ...I hope that made sense...=]

Use this kinematic: y=(1/2)at^2+Vot. The initial velocity is zero because the Y velocity is zero when the bag is starting to be dropped. Now you're left with this: y=(1/2)at^2. Solve for t so you can get the time. You get t=sqaureroot(2y/a) after the algebra. now just plug in numbers. t=sqrt[(2(-50 m))/-9.8 m/s^2]. The acceleration and the vertical distance are negative because I usually make down negative. so you should get 3.194382825 sec for the time. Now, use that time to find horizontal displacement. Use this: x=(1/2)at^2 + Vot. When an object is falling, the horizontal acceleration is always zero, so you are left with: x=Vot. Just plug in the initial velocity and the time. Make sure you convert the units of the given velocity to m/s. If you do the conversion, 300 km/hr is the same as 83.3333333333 m/s. Just plug that in: x=(83.333333333 m/s)(3.194382825 s). Then you will get X=266 as your answer. Hope that helped! =D

Ftkr9jqYaa	Eukaryotic cells, in general, are more sophisticated at the following types of transport:<br>  <br>  (1) Protein targeting.  Protein targeting or protein sorting is the mechanism by which a cell transports proteins to the appropriate positions in the cell or extracellularly. Sorting targets can be the inner space of an organelle, any of several interior membranes, the cell's outer membrane, or its exterior via secretion or exocytosis. This delivery process is carried out based on information contained in the protein itself. Correct sorting is crucial for the cell; errors can lead to diseases.<br>  <br>  (2) Ion channels.  Ion channels are pore-forming proteins that help establish and control the small voltage gradient across the plasma membrane of all living cells by allowing the flow of ions down their electrochemical gradient. They are present in the membranes that surround all biological cells.<br>  <br>  (3) Translocons.  The translocon (commonly known as a translocator or translocation channel) is the complex of proteins associated with the translocation of nascent polypeptides across membranes. In eukaryotes the polypeptides are transported into the interior (cisternal or luminal) space of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from the cytosol. This process requires the protein to cross a hydrophobic lipid bilayer. In prokaryotes, a similar protein complex transports polypeptides across the plasma membrane. Bacterial pathogens can assemble translocons in their host membranes, allowing them to export virulence factors into their target cells.<br>  <br>  SecY protein is main transmembrane subunit of eubacterial protein secretory pathway and protein-secreting ATPase complex, also known as translocon.  Secretion across the inner membrane in Gram-negative bacteria occurs via the preprotein translocase pathway. Proteins are produced in the cytoplasm as precursors, and require a chaperone subunit to direct them to the translocase component. From there, the mature proteins are either targeted to the outer membrane, or remain as periplasmic proteins. The translocase protein subunits are encoded on the bacterial chromosome.<br>  <br>  (4) In eukaryotic cells, the electron transport system is located in the inner membrane of the mitochondria.  In prokaryotic cells, the electron transport system is located in the cytoplasmic membrane.

df7bf836aea5d7c83e8e3ffb0bf38d9baa	Actually more specifically they are ectothermic (they get their body temperature by the temperature of their surrounding environment). They are this way because of two things. First, an animal that is endothermic (creates their own body heat) must eat a lot and must do so regularly. This creates pressure on the animal to hunt all the time. Creatures that are not forced to do this can gain advantages especially in environments that don't have regular or enough food (places like caves or benthic environment is a good example). Gators can wait for long periods of time until prey comes along.<br>  <br>  Second, the endothermic animal must have a way to insulate itself in order to keep that heat within it's body. Either fat, feathers or fur is important to an endothermic animal to ensure it's keeping at least some of the heat it's generating. Humans don't have much of either so we wear clothing. <br>  <br>  The downside to being ectothermic means that if it's very cold, they can't go anywhere. The muscles must be warmed up in order for the animal to function so they are at a disadvantage in cold weather. They therefore tend to thrive in tropical and sub tropical areas where it's warm (or hot) the majority of the year. Also, they also must take refuge if it gets too hot out (they can overheat in a hot environment too).  So they're spending time and energy regulating their temp.<br>  <br>  The reason that animals are either endothermic or ectothermic is dependent on their hearts. The ectothermic heart of a frog has only a couple of chambers and is not very efficient. The crocodilians have an improvement in having 3 chambers but still not sufficiently effiecient to create body heat. Only by getting into the birds and mammals do you get an efficient four chambered heart which allows the body to create heat.|`|uPVnqbE8aa	All the lower forms of animals, such as single celled creatures, and insects, and Mollusks, etc, including fish, Amphibians, and Reptiles are ectothermic (derive their body temperature from the surrounding air).  Because of this, their metabolism and activity depends on the temperature.  If it's cold they slow down, if it's too cold they die.   If it's warm they are normal, if it's too hot they die.  Therefore, they do whatever they can to control their body heat, like crawl into the shade if it's too hot, or lay down at night on a rock that's been heated by the sun during the day.  <br>  One of the biggest steps in evolution is when these animals evolved into warm blooded (endothermic) creatures, the birds and Mammals, that could maintain their own body temperature through metabolism and not have to depend on the temperature of the air.|`|n29r3q9taa	cold blooded animals are those who can't maintain their internal environment (temperature etc) with respect external environment<br>  so alligators and frogs are cold blooded|`|QUIR4LZraa	It allows them to use less energy to heat their body so they don't need to consume as much.

NbdTgyLPaa	This problem is actually just sloppy thinking.  Starting off, the amounts owed are 100 euros to A and 50 euros to B, for a total of 150 euros owed.  Later, 30 euros is repaid to A, so the total owed is now 120 euros.<br>  <br>  The two chocolates worth a total of 20 euros have nothing to do with the amount owed, so you don't add that figure to the amount owed.  Instead you look at what happened to the money.  100 euros was lost.  Then 20 euros was spent on chocolate.  Finally 30 euros was repaid on one of the loans.  So you originally got 150 euros, and it's all accounted for by adding the amount lost plus the amount spent plus the amount repaid, i.e. 150 euros = 100 euros lost + 20 euros spent + 30 euros repaid.|`|JCVs8W6raa	this need a lot of time and I don't have time to waste I am sorry~_~!!|`|2gDQrFxdaa	You just have to think of the money you have and the money spent.<br>  for example:<br>       HAVE    |    SPENT<br>  _______________________<br>        100      |    -100<br>         50         |     -20<br>         30         |     -30<br>  _______________________<br>  <br>  if you add the spent side you'll see the results.<br>  It's only accounting, managing books.|`|2vNEPjkYaa	the 10 euros went 2 the guy @ the store's pocket!!!<br>  lmao <br>  dat is confusing!!!|`|Co3N6BS3aa	wow thats actually really confusing!!

QJ5Lh3wUaa	A huge number of ideas have been suggested as possible causes for the dinosaur extinction. Some of the suggestions include:<br>  - asteroid impact, <br>  - volcano, <br>  - a supernova bathing the earth in radiation<br>  - mammals eating dinosaur eggs, <br>  - dinosaurs getting high from LSD-like chemicals in flowering plants (flowering plants evolved during the Cretaceous period towards the end of the era of the dinosaurs -- however they first appeared many millions of yeas before dinosaurs became extinct)<br>  - caterpillars eating dinosaur's food supplies<br>  - low sea levels allowing landbridges to form between continents, allowing dinosaurs to migrate and spread disease<br>  <br>  Here's the thing big extinction happened 65 million years ago. It didn't just kill the dinosaurs, it all killed lots of animals and plants too.<br>  <br>  There is a chart on this page of some animal groups: <a href="http://www.dinosaurjungle.com/dinosaur_facts_timeline.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.dinosaurjungle.com/dinosaur_f...</a><br>  <br>  Notice how at the end of the Cretaceous period, Ammonites and Belemnites (things similar to squids that lived in the seas) suddenly stop 65 million years ago.    Further down the chart so too do Mosasaurs (big reptiles that lived in the sea), Plesiosaurs and Pliosaurs (more marine reptiles), Pterosaurs (flying reptiles), and of course, Dinosaurs.<br>  <br>  Also (but not shown on the chart) are other groups that were partially wiped out: like various plankton and plantlife, many types of birds, etc.<br>  <br>  So whatever explains the event, doesn't need to just explain dinosaurs, but all the other things that died out too.    (To be fair some groups of dinosaurs, as well pterosaurs, and plesiosaurs seem to have already been in decline before the extinction occurred).<br>  <br>  The explanation also needs to allow for the fact that all these creatures had been very successful for a very long time, but then suddenly they disappeared.  Something seems to have happened - something abnormal - and out of the blue - and all over the world - and effected all these types of animals and plants.<br>  <br>  A really big volcano or an asteroid hitting the earth are<br>  the most plausible explanations.  As far as I know there is no evidence for the supernova theory (and there would be traces), and the other theories like mammals eating dinosaur eggs, or diseases, or caterpillars,  don't explain why all sorts of animals or plants were affected, or why the event was sudden and largelyt out of the blue.<br>  <br>  So that leaves the volcano and asteroid theories (although of course it's possible one or more of the other things like disease could have weakened some groups before the volcano/asteroid)<br>  <br>  Either a volcano or asteroid would not only kill animals nearby to it, but would also have put lots of dust in the air for years, causing most plants around the world to die (no sunlight), and then animals too which didn't have enough food.  Volcanos (or perhaps an asteroid) could also cause acid rain.<br>  <br>  Evidence for volcano - there was lots of volcanic at the right time in India<br>  <br>  Evidence for asteroid hitting earth - there is a crater in Mexico that looks like it could be the spot.  There is a layer of iridium (a metal that usually ones comes from asteroids) in rocks around the whole world from the right age.<br>  <br>  It could of course be a combination of both causes.|`|52cGZS3caa	The main theory is an asteroid strike which sent up a debris cloud that blocked the suns rays which in turn caused global cooling. The asteroid was massive and there are several theories as to where it struck, one of them being the Gulf of Mexico.|`|AA11081868	There are many prevailing theories as to why the dinosaurs went extinct. The latest theory linked to scientific evidence is a mass kill off by intestinal parasites, suggesting that the extinction occurred slowly over thousands of years. Massive vol canoe eruptions ejected enough particulate into the atmosphere to block out the sun. The Yucatan asteroid may have finished them off. Bad time in Earth history to be a dinosaur! see links below.|`|0U6fSHGOaa	There are dozens of theories to explain a probable cause or causes. Throughout the Mesozoic Era, individual dinosaur species were evolving and becoming extinct for various reasons. The unusually massive extinction at the end of the Cretaceous exterminated the last of the dinosaurs, the flying reptiles, and the large swimming reptiles, as well as many other marine animals. There is now widespread evidence that a meteorite impact was at least the partial cause for this extinction. Impact craters are visible on most planets in our solar system. A spectacular example of this was witnessed in 1994, when Jupiter was struck by a series of cometary fragments. Some of these impact blasts were larger than the Earth's diameter. Other factors such as extensive release of volcanic gases, climatic cooling (with related changes in ocean currents and weather patterns), sea-level change, low reproduction rates, poison gases from a comet, or changes in the Earth's orbit or magnetic field may have contributed to this extinction event.|`|MPmpcQ4Taa	My favorite is the Gary Larson idea, that they all died from smoking, <br>  but Walt Disney thought it was brought on by the planet getting hotter as was shown in Fantasia.<br>  the previlant theory is that a meteor struck the Yucatan and set a massive firestorm that burnt up the dinos and let the little varmits who became mammals become the big time players they became.

You then need 2*0.41*0.105 moles of HCl.  From a 0.130M solution you get V*0.130 moles of solute, so<br>  <br>  V*0.130 = 2*0.41*0.105<br>  <br>  V = 2*0.41*0.105/0.130 L<br>  <br>  2) The reaction is 2NaOH + H2SO4 --->  Na2SO4 + 2H2O.<br>  The reaction requires 2 moles of NaOH  to react with one mole of H2SO4.  Determine the moles of NaOH in 0.160 g  (0.160/mol mass) and divide by 2 to find the moles of H2SO4 react.  Set that equal to V*0.125 to find V in liters.<br>  <br>  3)  Sodium sulfate is Na2SO4.  The reaction is BaCL2 + Na2SO4 ----> 2NaCl + BaSO4↓.  So one mole of BaCl2 is needed to precipitate one mole SO4.  Find the no of moles in 758 g of NaSO4 (758 / mol. mass), That is the number of moles in the HCl solution, which is in 43.0mL.  Since molarity is moles per liter, divide the moles by 0.43 to get molarity.<br>  <br>  4)The reaction is 2HCl + Ca(OH)2 ----> CaCl2 +  2H2O,  2 moles of HCl neutralize one mole of Ca(OH)2.  Find the moles of HCl (0.43*0.218 moles), multiply by 2 to find the moles of Ca(OH)2 reacted.  Multiply that by the molecular mass of Ca(OH)2 to get the grams<br>  <br>  Note: you can find molecular masses from reference books or look up the compound in wikipedia.  Or, you can add up the atomic masses of the constituent elements.
c1a600e6083d6130287db4610398bcd3aa	Hydrogen is used for two reasons:<br>  <br>  The gas which fills any generator is also present in the generator's airgap and there due to high turbulence, it develops a quantity of friction loss, the so called windage loss.  This heats up the gas.  <br>  <br>  The gas is also normally circulated through the hotter active parts of the generator to cool them and taken through water coolers to remove these losses to the outside.<br>  <br>  The best gas will have:<br>  <br>   1) low friction loss to avoid heating itself and<br>  <br>   2) a high heat capacity to pick up heat with minimum temperature rise. <br>  <br>  With its low viscosity and high specific heat, hydrogen is the best gas available and is therefore used in large generators where the cooling requirements are severe.  Even then the low density of hydrgen is a disadvantage so it is always employed at elevated pressure - usually between 3 and 5 atm gauge.<br>  <br>  At the high flow rates used and turbulence involved, the heat transfer to the hydrogen is not a problem and its thermal conductivity is not an issue.<br>  <br>  The only other gas used for cooling generators is air (basic reasons should be clear) which of course is used wherever possible in preference to hydrogen.  Since about 1990 great progress has been made in the use of air cooling and nowadays it can be used on generators up to about 400MVA unit size.|`|9634adc643ad32c66405cde6d71caefeaa	hydrogen has the highest heat transfer of any gas, because it has high thermal conductivity, and low viscosity so it can be pumped at a high rate with low pumping losses.

AA10854273	Prophase<br>  The cell enters prophase as the long tangled DNA molecules, or chromatin, coil into the compact bodies of chromosomes. This coiling process is comparable to taking a thin strand 656 ft (200 m) long and coiling it into a cylinder 1 mm wide by 8 mm long. A structure called the kinetochore is formed on each chromatid at the outer face of the centromere region. The nuclear membrane breaks down.<br>  <br>  During prophase, the cells' cytoskeleton or structural framework made of the protein tubulin breaks down into subunits. From these subunits, a bridge of microtubules called the spindle apparatus forms between the two pairs of centrioles as they move apart. When the centrioles reach opposite ends of the cell, they extend microtubules in all directions. Like a boat moored to a dock with multiple lines, the centriole anchors itself . Stages of mitosis. Illustration by Hans & Cassidy. Courtesy of Gale Group. the cell membrane. This arrangement of microtubules—called an aster because of its star-like pattern—is thought to mechanically strengthen the spindle apparatus. Mitosis does not appear to depend upon the presence of centrioles, however. Destroying centrioles in animal cells with a laser beam does not prevent mitosis. Plant cells equipped with rigid cell walls, but neither centrioles nor asters, also grow by mitotic division.<br>  <br>  As prophase continues, a set of microtubules grows from the kinetochore of each sister chromatid. The microtubules extending from each chromatid become attached to opposite poles of the spindle.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   Anaphase<br>  As if following a neatly choreographed dance, the sister chromatids separate, rapidly moving toward the pole to which their microtubule is attached. The cell appears "stretched" as the spindle fibers slide past one another, elongating the spindle apparatus and further separating the poles. Shortening of the microtubules by removal of tubulin units pulls the chromosomes closer and closer to the pole. The movement of sister chromatids to opposite sides of the cell completes the equal division and distribution of genetic material.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Metaphase<br>  <br>  Metaphase, from the ancient Greek μετ? (after) and φ?σι? (stage), is a stage of mitosis in the eukaryotic cell cycle in which condensed chromosomes, carrying genetic information, align in the middle of the cell before being separated into each of the two daughter cells.<br>  In metaphase, the chromosomes align in the middle of the cell.<br>  <br>  Preceded by events in prometaphase and followed by anaphase, microtubules formed in prophase have already found and attached themselves to kinetochores in metaphase. The centromeres of the chromosomes convene themselves on the metaphase plate, an imaginary line that is equidistant from the two centrosome poles. This even alignment is due to the counterbalance of the pulling powers generated by the opposing kinetochores, analogous to a tug of war between equally strong people. In certain types of cells, chromosomes do not line up at the metaphase plate and instead move back and forth between the poles randomly, only roughly lining up along the middleline. Early events of metaphase can coincide with the later events of prometaphase, as chromosomes with connected kinetochores will start the events of metaphase individually before other chromosomes with unconnected kinetochores that are still lingering in the events of prometaphase.<br>  <br>  One of the cell cycle checkpoints occurs during prometaphase and metaphase. Only after all chromosomes have become aligned at the metaphase plate, when every kinetochore is properly attached to a bundle of microtubules, does the cell enter anaphase. It is thought that unattached or improperly attached kinetochores generate a signal to prevent premature progression to anaphase, even if most of the kinetochores have been attached and most of the chromosomes have been aligned. Such a signal creates the mitotic spindle checkpoint. This would be accomplished by regulation of the Anaphase Promoting Complex, securin, and separase.<br>  <br>  <br>  Metaphase in the study of cancer and genetics<br>  <br>  The analysis of metaphase chromosomes is one of the main tools of cancer cytogenetics. Malignant cells from solid tumors or leukemia samples are grown in short term culture and dropped onto microscope slides to generate metaphase preparations. Staining of the slides, often with Giemsa or Quinacrine, produces a pattern of in total up to several hundred bands. Inspection of the stained metaphases allows the determination of numerical and structural changes in the tumor cell genome, for example, losses of chromosomal segments or translocations, which may lead to chimeric oncogenes, such as bcr-abl in Chronic myelogenous leukemia.<br>  <br>  Additionally, normal metaphase spreads are used as hybridization matrix for comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) experiments.|`|rGlRMe8haa	These are stages of mitosis or cell division.

There’s aircraft and space attack and communications which is aerospace (with EE and CompE supporting it as well).

VxZl2hTcaa	I will assume "ctg^2*x/2" should be "ctg^2(x/2)" instead.<br>  <br>  Remember that cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent, and tan(x)=sin(x)/cos(x), so ctg(x) = cos(x)/sin(x).  Thus we can rewrite your limit as:<br>  lim x-->0 {(x^2)(cos^2(x/2))/(sin^2(x/2))}<br>  <br>  First, we can notice that x^2 --> 0 as x --> 0.  This does NOT necessarily mean that the whole limit is zero though; that depends on the behavior of the other parts of our limit also!<br>  <br>  Next, we can see that x/2 --> 0 as x/2 -->0, so cos(x/2) --> 1 (since cos(0) = 1).  Thus cos^2(x/2) --> 1 also.<br>  <br>  Now we need to examine the denominator.  Again, we have x/2 --> 0, so sin(x/2) --> 0 (since sin(0) = 0).  Thus sin^2(x/2) --> 0 also.<br>  <br>  We can see that our limit is approaching the indeterminate form 0/0.  We should try to use L'Hospital's rule to resolve this.  Under these circumstances, L'Hospital's rule says:<br>  lim f(x)/g(x) = lim f'(x)/g'(x)<br>  <br>  I'll let you do the rest yourself.  You may have to use L'Hospital's rule more than once, but you should eventually be able to get it into a form that is not indeterminate.|`|ZDYgzYzxaa	I'm assuming that ctg is cotangent, either way the whole function approaches zero because x^2 approaches zero when you plug in zero and since your multiplying that by the rest of the function than 0 times anything equals zero.

Ftkr9jqYaa	A sedative is a substance that induces sedation by reducing irritability or excitement.<br>  <br>  At higher doses it may result in slurred speech, staggering gait, poor judgment, and slow, uncertain reflexes. Doses of sedatives such as benzodiazepines when used as a hypnotic to induce sleep tend to be higher than those used to relieve anxiety, since low doses suffice to provide calming sedative effects.<br>  <br>  Sedatives can be abused to produce an overly-calming effect (alcohol being the classic and most common sedating drug). At high doses or when they are abused, many of these drugs can cause unconsciousness and even death.<br>  <br>  There is some overlap between the terms "sedative" and hypnotic.  The term "sedative-hypnotic" has been used to describe these joint effects, or the medications causing these joint effects. MeSH (i.e., Medical Subject Headings) classifies these agents in a single category, under CNS depressants.<br>  <br>  However, advances in pharmacology have permitted more specific targeting of receptors, and greater selectivity of agents, which necessitates greater precision when describing these agents and their effects:<br>  <br>  (1) Anxiolytic refers specifically to the effect upon anxiety. (However, some benzodiazipines are sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics.)<br>  <br>  (2) Tranquilizer can refer to anxiolytics or antipsychotics.<br>  <br>  (3) Soporific and sleeping pill are near-synonyms for hypnotics. <br>  <br>  Types of sedatives:<br>  <br>  (1) Barbiturates:  Amobarbital (Amytal), pentobarbital (Nembutal), secobarbital (Seconal), Phenobarbitol (Luminal).<br>  <br>  (2) Benzodiazepines ("minor tranquilizers"):  Clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium), estazolam (Prosom), flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), lorazepam (Ativan), midazolam (Versed), nitrazepam (Mogadon), oxazepam (Serax), triazolam (Halcion), temazepam (Restoril, Normison, Planum, Tenox, and Temaze), chlordiazepoxide (Librium), alprazolam (Xanax).<br>  <br>  (3) Herbal sedatives:  ashwagandha, catnip, kava (Piper methysticum), mandrake, cannabis, valerian.<br>  <br>  (4) Solvent sedatives:  chloral hydrate (Noctec), diethyl ether (Ether), ethyl alcohol (alcoholic beverage), methyl trichloride (Chloroform).<br>  <br>  (5) Nonbenzodiazepine sedatives:  eszopiclone (Lunesta), zaleplon (Sonata), zolpidem (Ambien), zopiclone (Imovane, Zimovane).<br>  <br>  (6) Uncategorized Sedatives:  carisoprodol (Soma), clomethiazole (clomethiazole), gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), Thalidomide, ethchlorvynol (Placidyl), glutethimide (Doriden), ketamine (Ketalar, Ketaset), methaqualone (Sopor, Quaalude), methyprylon (Noludar), ramelteon (Rozerem).

Ulme5ewraa	Well, the subunit goes and finds another subunit (in humans one large and one small), they get married (combine), and make babies (synthesize proteins).  They can either be bound to the Endoplasmic Reticulum or floating free in the cells.  Usually they're bound to the ER.  They read the messenger RNA sequences, and connect the corresponding Amino Acids in order to create all the different proteins you have in your body.  If you need more of an explanation or elaboration just ask.  Hope this helps.

Ftkr9jqYaa	EURYMYLIDS<br>  <br>  Glires (Latin glīrēs, dormice) is a clade consisting of rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits, hares, and pikas). This hypothesis that these form a monophyletic group has been long debated based on morphological evidence, although recent morphological studies strongly support monophyly of Glires. In particular, the discovery of new fossil material of basal members of Glires, particularly the genera Mimotona, Gomphos, Heomys, Matutinia, Rhombomylus, and Sinomylus, has helped to bridge the gap between more typical rodents and lagomorphs. Data based on nuclear DNA support Glires as a sister of Euarchonta to form Euarchontoglires, but some genetic data from both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA have been less supportive. A study investigating retrotransposon presence/absence data unambiguously supports the Glires hypothesis.<br>  <br>  Rodents share 27 features with eurymylids. Except for some tiny structure of cheek teeth, e. g. large hypocone shelf and compressed trigonid, they concur on almost all of Hartenberger's definition of rodentia. Some new evidence based on the post-cranial material of Rhombomylus indicate that eurymylids are different from lagomorphs, but similar to the primitive rodents, such as Paramyid. So, all the character analyses of eurymylids lead us to think that a reasonable ancestor of rodents should arise from a primitive Cretaceous eurymylid, even if HEOMYS seems to be somewhat too specialized to be a direct ancestor of rodents. Mimotonids, which is a sister group to Eurymylids, may have given rise to Lagomorphs.<br>  <br>  According to another expert, the common ancestor of rodents and lagomorphs was probably a Condylarth in the early Paleocene.
nuhi9H6paa	deanmaulden...sorry to burst your bubble... but you are the idiot! <br>  It was determined that the huge gamma-ray burst occurred 12.2 billion light years away.That is in LIGHT YEARS not 12.2 billion years.<br>   Light year is defined as the distance that light travels in a vacuum in 1 year which equals 5.88 trillion miles. A light year is a measurement of distance, not of time. Light can be used to measure distance since it is the fastest known thing in the Universe.<br>  <br>  To clarify some answers… the gamma-ray blast did not come anywhere near earth. The US space agency's Fermi telescope detected this massive explosion in space.<br>  <br>  The explosion was to far away to have an effect on earth.

AA11081868	Granite and basalt are essentially the same material. Both begin as magma below the Earth's surface. Basalt formations are lava flows that have solidified (above ground). Granite is magma(molten rock) that cools beneath the surface allowing enough time for crystals to form. Granite is easily identified by the crystal formation, usually black/white/grey/ clear crystals. Basalt cools quickly, not enough time for crystals to form. Basalt is dark brown in color. See samples of granite below.
RgSCstkAaa	The answer is an emphatic no. A grill is a resistive device, so the mains frequency does not matter, but the applied voltage certainly does. If, in essence, you double the voltage, you double the current and quadruple the power consumption. The grill will burn out very quickly. get another converter for your other appliances, or, better still, buy another grill.|`|60cdc28a1dcd202db491895e0793ce8eaa	this is what happen when you run a 120v grill on 240v power<br>  <br>  W = T ^ 4<br>  on 240v <br>  W = double<br>  assumed element temp at 120v is 1500 F, when you used it on 240v, the temp of the element will be<br>  <br>  T = (1500)(2) ^ (0.25)<br>  T = 1784 F<br>  the element will be burnt out within an hour<br>  <br>  here is what i was playing around by using a heavy duty SCR in series and cut down 40% of the 240v (for heating element only, not advisable for motor).

The difference in frequency has no effect, because, your grill is a resistive load. You said you have a household voltage converter, check if the voltage in its output is really 120volts.|`|4fWZL4TRaa	I don't know what the household voltage converter is, but I imagine it is a transformer, the only proper way to do this. It converts the 220V to 120V. It has to have enough Watts for the job. As these are relatively expensive, it may be easier to buy a grill suitable for the local supply.<br>  <br>  I think it is just plain silly to suggest running it on 220V directly. It will try to use 8000W instead of 2400 (guessing at the rating). That will certainly drop breakers, overload wiring, and destroy it in short order. Don't go there.

However, if you lose an arm, how do you tell the operator that and have him coordinate with the lost mass? It's not very often you lose an arm and have to account for the lost mass.<br>  <br>  If it's not humanoid shaped go with the computer panels. The computer will be able to calculate, accounting for lost mass and environmental variables, faster than the human pilot and would be able to assist in targeting.<br>  <br>  Of course, it's slower to give it commands so there would have to be some sort of combined method that'd be the best.|`|3qGdN6xMaa	I would use controls like Wii.<br>  <br>  I would expect to stand on something like a Wii-Fit balance board in a little enclosure, and as I walk on the sensor board, the suit walks in response.  <br>  <br>  I may hold controls, something simple with a few buttons and thumb-pad (like Wii controls!!!), or if I need more precise movement control, just strap the sensors on the robo-pilots arms and legs.

Look up SARCOS exoskeleton to see the most advanced one in the US military labs.  But if you are talking about a “big” one like in Japanese cartoons, I would use something natural like the SARCOS one (at least for the hands) but with added artificial intelligence to be able to balance itself and walk because you can’t really feel that the big robot is balancing with your own body.  But I’m not exactly sure how the exoskeleton works because it’s secret but it looks to me that they just have pressure sensors that will move the suit in the same direction the soldier is moving his limbs.  So either the robot balances itself, or the soldier has to be careful otherwise it will tip over.  Because it’s no longer the form of your own body even though it’s smaller than a Gundam.  But it’s still work in progress.|`|lz6vt0ofaa	I would use true mechanical means of control. servo's, hydraulic pistons, electro-pneumatic would probably be as high tech I'd get for durability and longevity.

ossCVxPqaa	Your question is not at all clear. If you are asking, why is sulphur recovered in areas of abundant water, then the answer is that it is not.<br>  <br>  It is true that elemental sulfur can be found near hot springs and volcanic regions in many parts of the world, especially along the Pacific Ring of Fire. Such volcanic deposits are currently mined in Indonesia, Chile, and Japan. Sicily is also famous for its sulfur mines.<br>  <br>  Significant deposits of elemental sulfur also exist in salt domes along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, and in evaporites in eastern Europe and western Asia. The sulfur in these deposits is believed to come from the action of anaerobic bacteria on sulfate minerals, especially gypsum, although apparently native sulfur may be produced by geological processes alone, without the aid of living organisms . However, fossil-based sulfur deposits from salt domes are the basis for commercial production in the United States, Poland, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine.<br>  <br>  This is a quote from Wikipedia. So you see that the major production of sulphur does not occur near to water.

A7Z0mmO1aa	This is a very interesting question.<br>  <br>  CDF is the function such that <br>  <br>  F(x)=P(X<=x)<br>  <br>  Now, we know that the distance can not be > 2R (since R is the radius, the farthest distance between two points within the circle is the diameter of the circle):<br>  <br>  F(2R)= 1 (and F(x) remains 1 for all values above 2R)<br>  Similarly, the distance cannot <0, distance is always positive.<br>  <br>  F(0)= 0 and F(x) remains 0 for all values of x<0<br>  Now, we need to find the value of F(x) for 0<x<2R<br>  <br>  Without loss of generality, let us assume that the first point is at a distance r from the center of the circle.<br>  <br>  The distance between the two points will be <d, iff the second point lies within a circle of radius d around the first point. (Also, it should lie within the original circle).<br>  <br>  So, we need to compute the area of intersection between the two circles. There is a formula for this in my source.<br>  <br>  There are exceptions when the circle of radius d lies entirely within the main circle (This can only occur if r+d<=R, so that the second circle lies entirely within the original circle)<br>  <br>  Once you get the area, you can integrate it with r going from 0 to R, then divide by R (to get the average area of intersection).<br>  <br>  Then, you can divide it by the total sample space (area of the big circle, 2 * pi * R) to get the P(x<d) or F(x).<br>  <br>  I hope this gives you some start.. This problem is more complex than I thought.. I will keep thinking and update if I figured out a better way.

These determine the density of water and how the submarine will be effected. The higher the density of the water, the lighter the boat is compared to the water. What happens to all three of these variable will determine your answer.<br>  <br>  Higher Salinity = Higher Density (Very Significant)<br>  Higher Temperature = Lower Density (Very Significant)<br>  Deep Depth = Higher Density (Negligible, but does result in hull compression which actually makes the boat heavier!)<br>  <br>  So if Salinity decreases slightly with depth, but temperature also decreases significantly, the boat will be lighter. If temperature increase slightly with depth, but salinity significantly increase the boat will also be lighter. <br>  <br>  With you question, assuming Temp and Salinity are constant, the hull does not compress with depth, and pressure is massively higher deep, the boat will be lighter depp than shallow, by a very small amount!

For the purposes of a physics homework problem, they're probably ignoring all compressibility issues, and so the answer would be `the buoyancy is the same at both points.'.<br>  <br>  As another answerer said, salinity and temperature are also factors, and they do tend to vary somewhat with depth.

Muy probablemente haya unas cuantas civilizaciones ahi afuera, pero, desde luego no creo que se hayan puesto en contacto con nosotros aun. Nuestro planeta lleva enviando ondas electromagnéticas al espacio desde hace mas de 100 a?os, lo que significa que las civilizaciones en ese radio las habrian recibido en unos segundos (la nuestra) hasta 100 a?os despues de su transmision. Cuenta que responder a eso significarían otros tantos a?os, pero teoricamente nosotros deberiamos haber recibido otras radiaciones de civilizaciones. Lo cual quita de la zona que podria ser habitada de nuestra galaxia 100 a?os luz de extension. No obstante, quedan otros 119900 (aprox.) a?os luz de extension para algunas cuantas formas de vida alienígenas inteligentes, y no nos olvidemos de las miles de formas de vida no inteligentes que de seguro habra en muchísimos planetas de nuestra galaxia. Ademas hay que decir que nuestro universo tiene unos 15000Ma de vida, de los cuales nosotros hemos tardado en aparecer y evolucionar hasta ahora mas de 4000Ma. Por lo tanto podria haber no aparecido (o haber desaparecido ya) aun formas de vida inteligentes, o si pero llevar un retraso tecnológico que no les permitiría recibir nuestras se?ales (osea que ese circulito de 100 a?os luz aun podria contener vida). La ecuacion de Drake de todas formas, nos da las variables para calcular unas cuantas posibles civilizaciones.<br>  Mas improbable aun es que nos visiten: nada puede viajar tan rapido como la luz, por lo que tardarian en llegar varias centurias. Aunque podrian habeer venido hace 1Ma y no los habriamos recibido. Podrian haber pasado incluso mas cerca de lo que pensamos y no habernos detectado. Ademas las posibilidades de que nos encontraran, un planeta entre miles de millones, son demasiado bajas.<br>  <br>  Este tema es muuuy largo por lo que no he podido explicar bien mis ideas.

During apoptosis the damaging components of the cell are packaged away or neutralized. This reduces the inflammatory response they would cause if released in an uncontrolled way.<br>  <br>  It also provides an important developmental tool for example during the form of hands the fingers are webbed with a layer of skin between the fingers these cells apoptosis’ (programmed cell death) to form fingers.|`|AA10326494	Apoptosis is a mechanism of controlled cell death critically important in many biological processes. To maintain homeostasis in the human body, an estimated 10 billion cells are made each day just to balance those dying by apoptosis! It follows then that apoptosis’s role in normal physiology is as significant as that of its counterpart, mitosis. It plays a complementary, but opposite, role to mitosis in the regulation of cell populations.<br>  <br>  Apoptosis is involved in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. Some examples of these processes are:<br>   > Development <br>   > Inflammation and involution of tissues <br>   > In the immune system <br>   > In ageing <br>  <br>  Failure of apoptosis can lead to disease e.g. cancer<br>  <br>  The role of  apoptosis in each of these diverse areas implicates immense potential for the manipulation of apoptosis to treat disease. Research is already underway to harness apoptosis as a therapeutic tool in modern medicine.  Possibilities include: Control of malignant disease, delay of premature senescence in neurodegenerative disease, regulation of inflammatory disease, treatment of autoimmune disorders.|`|b21fc50e1c292795df845e7f2cc84273aa	apoptosis gets rid of old, worn out, dysfunctional cells from the body.  this is necessary for the body to maintain optimal functioning.  if the body detects a cell that is abnormal, not functioning the way it should, or if it is damaged in some way then it destroys it.  it is programmed cell death, so the body does it to maintain homeostasis.|`|54faf4f62f21efcb62bcb681ff90f2f4aa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis</a>

But I think you mean, find the probability that the 5 salespeople will help 3 women and 2 men (case 1) or 3 men and 2 women, is that so?<br>  <br>  If so,<br>  7+6=13<br>  There is a total of 13 customers.<br>  <br>  Case 1<br>  P(3 women, 2 men) <br>  = [(7/13)x(6/12)x(5/11)] x [(6/10)x(5/9)]<br>  = 35/858<br>  <br>  7/13 because there are 7 women out of the 13 people, assuming that there is nothing too distinct about the 7 women and they have an equal chance of being served by the salespeople. <br>  <br>  So subsequently, after the 1st woman is served, there are 12 people left and out of the 12, only 6  women are left, hence 6/12. The same can be said for how 5/11 is obtained. <br>  <br>  However, 6/10 comes about because now we have to consider the fact that 2 men are served. <br>  <br>  As we know, there are 6 men in total, none of them have been served yet and like the women, they have an equal probability of being served.<br>  <br>  But now there are only 10 people left, so the probability of the 1st man being choosen is then 6/10 and 2nd man being 5/9.<br>  <br>  Case 2<br>  P(3 men, 2 women)<br>  = [(6/13)x(5/12)x(4/11)] x [(7/10)x(6/9)]<br>  = 14/429<br>  <br>  Try to reason out for yourself how the fractions in case 2 are derived.<br>  <br>  Therefore,<br>  P(3 women 2 men or 3 men 2 women)<br>  = P(3 women, 2 men) + P(3 men, 2 women)<br>  = 35/858 + 14/429<br>  = 21/286<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. =)|`|y9dGQSCzaa	Being in retail sales, I would serve the first person to walk in the door regardless of gender.

79b32995d3b04f7afa136d67edf60426aa	The factorization of a number is basically a group of the lowest possible prime numbers that you can multiply whatever number you're dealing with.<br>  ex. 30=2x3x5<br>  most of these equations start off with 2, because it is the lowest prime # in this case.Try dividing 30 by these numbers, and you should end up getting 1.<br>  ex.30/2=15<br>  15/3=5<br>  5/5=1<br>  <br>  When trying to find the prime factorization of a #, you have to see which prime numbers divide into it. When you can't divide a # by 2 anymore, then you move on to dividing by 3, the next lowest prime # number, then 5, or 7, and so on.<br>  <br>  Here's some examples:<br>  <br>  20=2x2x5<br>  50=2x5x5<br>  15=3x5<br>  13=13<br>  <br>  <br>  With prime numbers, the prime factorization is always itself.<br>  <br>  All you have to do is work backwards.|`|08c47ade809f8810ef2b21fa9304d450aa	A factorization of a number would be a set of smaller integers that, when you multiply them all together, would equal the first number.  Prime numbers don't have a factorization unless you count that number and 1.  Integers will have a "prime" factorization which is a set of prime numbers that multiply to that first number. There is only one prime factorization for each positive integer.|`|450d99bbe319077869f2df5d225bac8faa	If you get into algerbra, a factorisation is when you take something and make it into the smallest bits it could be.

62112728f2b7ba1083b4136ac1b7adc3aa	Candle making can be very fun and enjoyable. All it takes is some wax, a little time and patience. There are basically three types of candles: dipped, molded, and container. Candle dipping may seem daunting at the start, but once you get used t0 it it becomes like second nature. Even so, I like the molded and container variety for general purpose spells because of their diversity. They are simple, quick and fun to make. You can layer different colors into the overall design for striking effects. Note that dipping and carving can result in far superior effects when it comes to color and design. <br>    <br>   Be sure to consecrate the ingredients and final products before using them as it saves time when you need to cast a short spell quickly or "on the fly." <br>  Let's begin with the most difficult procedure first, in other words, we'll start with dipped candles. Imagine a time when things were simpler and mankind depended upon the fundamental cycles of our Great Mother and her Ways. The very act of making a candle could be seen as a Magickal Rite on its own merit. This was a time when candles and lanterns were staples to provide light for everyday living. It was the spellcasters who recognized and made use of the flame's beauty and scrying potential and created candles for the express purpose of Magick. The mundane became the extraordinary, the common became sacred... Magick had begun.<br>  <br>  <br>  Equipment and supplies that you will need are as follows: A deep double-boiler. (You can make one as well, for example, take a large sauce pot and a tall smaller pot that is at least four inches deeper than the tallest candle that you want to make and about half the diameter of the large pot), wax (bee's wax is traditional), a coloring agent if you are going to make colored candles, you will also need small weights, scissors, an electric hot plate (it needs to be large enough to hold the larger pot or container comfortably), small dowels, wicks, and finally, you will want to purchase or construct a custom made drying/cooling rack designed specifically for this purpose. I suggest that you acquire your supplies at a crafting shop or a store dedicated to people who make their own candles. If you happen to be a purist and desire to make the dipped candles completely from scratch, gather the bee's wax that you need during the full or waxing moon (this can be a bit tricky) or purchase it from a beekeeper who is sympathetic to your Magickal needs. Do not quibble over the price of the wax (or any other Magickal item that you purchase from someone else for that matter). Wicks can be made in the following manner : take COTTON string and toss it into melted wax. Stir occasionally to make sure it is completely saturated with wax. Remove it from the wax and hang it about to dry. Note that you can get strings of varying thickness and with different weaves, experiment with different sizes and brands until you find the perfect thickness and weave for your needs. Cut the string into lengths four to six inches longer than you want the candles to be and dip each cut end into the hot wax up to the length that you want, leaving a "loop" that has no wax (you will be using it to hold the candles while you dip and when you hang them on your drying rack). I've found that an old wooden clothes-drying rack works exceptionally well because it already has long open rungs and dowels. Another benefit is that it can be folded up when not in use. Use logic when you are designing or purchasing a drying rack, it needs to have rungs and/or dowels spaced at least a few inches apart as this will allow the candles to dangle in the air without touching or banging into each other. Keep in mind that wax is flammable, use extreme caution and care throughout the procedures, do not under any circumstances use an open flame to heat or melt it. Using a double boiler prevents the wax from getting too hot and reduces the risk of the wax flashing into flames (keep a lid handy to cover the wax should it flash off. Place the wax into the tall pot and water into the large pot. Put the tall pot into the water filled large pot and turn the hotplate on. If you desire to make colored or scented candles, add the coloring and/or scent when the wax is completely melted. You will want to add the color and/or scent slowly until it looks and smells good to you. When the wax is completely melted you may begin the procedure of making your tapers. Tie two small weights on each side of the wick and allow the wick to dangle straight down. Don't worry about the "trailer" (the extra wick that you use to tie the weights to), as this will be trimmed before you put your newly made candles away. Make sure that there is enough wax to dip the wick up to the intended length of the candle without bending the wicks. This is very important, you don't want to have lopsided candles. I would suggest that the level of the wax be at least four inches deeper than you want the length to be. More is better in this situation; there's nothing more frustrating than to run out of wax with the diameter of your candle smaller than you want (especially if you found the perfect color or scent). In other words, don't run out of wax. You can always add more wax, but you may find that the intensity of the color or scent diminishes and if you do add more scent or colour to compensate for the loss, you may not get the balance exactly the same. Be sure to write down what you do in your book of shadows so you can replicate your results as best you can when you do it again. To hold the wicks while you dip use a y-shaped holder much like a slingshot. You can devise a similar holder or you can dip and keep them separate by hand. Make sure the candles don't bang the side of the pot or each other. Now comes the tricky part, you want to build wax on the wicks without melting the previous layer. In order to prevent this, make sure that each layer is completely cooled to room temperature before you dip again and when you do, dip quickly. It is the process of dipping that builds the diameter of your candles, but if you keep the wicks in too long, the diameter will decrease or melt completely. It will take time to get the technique down. Don't get discouraged if the first candles don't turn out like you want them to. Practice is the key. One last note (angelic voices sing), making dipped candles can be a wee bit sloppy. Plastic or newspaper should be covering the floor, table or any other surface that could potentially come in contact with your hot wax.<br>  There is not much difference between a molded and container candle, one is released from a mold, and the other is contained within a fireproof container and not removed (fancy glass containers work exceedingly well, they are fire resistant and look beautiful). The procedure is really quite simple and straightforward. Melt your wax and add any coloring or scenting materials (herbs tossed in the wax can produce interesting container or molded candles). Pour the wax into the mold or container. Molds can be created with various containers found around the house or purchased at most any crafting shop. The thing to remember about molded candles is that the candle needs to be released easily from its mold. You can use "throwaway" cartons or containers (a good example being the waxy paperboard that milk comes in) or you can use more permanent molds that you have made or purchased. <br>  Below are a few "artsy" examples for you to try. Above all else, have as much fun with them and be as creative as you can, there is literary no limit to what you can do with simple containers and molds. It's amazing how a little wax and string can completely transform the mundane into a beautiful work of art. One of my favourite molded candles goes something like this: Cut a quart sized milk carton in half so that it is about half its original height. Get a wick and wrap some of it around a dowel. Place the unwrapped side of the wick into the center of the candle making sure that the bottom of the wick is secured to the bottom of the carton (I use tape but you could use most anything that has weight -you don't want your wick to float to the top of the candle. Rest the dowel end on the top of the carton and take up any extra slack. Here's the fun part, go get some ice from your freezer and toss it in the container. It is better to have large cubes than small ones, but try varying sizes until you find the one that suits you. It is important that you keep the wick as centered as possible because you don't want to have the candle burn unevenly. Now pour your melted wax into the milk container. I suggest that you have the milk carton filled with ice and the wick already in place, then the entire apparatus can be stored in the freezer while the wax melts. What happens here is the wax becomes hard almost instantly and leaves holes throughout the candle. When it is burnt down to about halfway in the center, you can place a votive candle in the well made from the flame. I suggest that until it reaches the "halfway" mark that you burn it no longer than an hour or two at a time. When you do burn it, keep pouring the wax out of the center well and reserve it for future use. You will find that each candle made this way is a unique creation -no two of these will ever be the same. You may want to add a second color to your candle and by all means do so, simply drain the water that is leftover from the ice and pour the next color into the holes that the ice left behind. This simple technique can produce dazzling results and many will wonder exactly how you created it. Another way to enhance a candle is to line your mold or container with fresh sprigs of cedar or any other hearty greenery, then pour the wax into the container and let it solidify. Pop it out of its mold and you have imbedded sprigs trapped within a beautiful candle. Another way is to line a cut glass container with sprigs and pour about four centimeters of wax into the bottom of it. This will anchor the sprigs to the sides. When the wax is completely cooled and the sprigs firmly in place you can add the rest of the wax (which should be cooled to a thick syrup- like consistency). As you can see, there are many many different ways to make candles. Try different techniques until you find one that you are comfortable with. Search antique shops and other places for things that can be made into a mold or kept as is for a container. Candles are a part of your Magick and help in generating a Magickal state of Mind so make them personal. The more energy that you put into them, the more likely you are to have successful results.|`|8bd45d8407efce2c3739d31fa1e59585aa	u need wax ,that u an find in wax factories which make candles or from honey farms who also kip wax<br>  then u need a frame can be of wood wer u put ur designs <br>  u can add different colors to the raw wax<br>  then put a thread and rub it with some raw wax <br>  put the thread in the frame n melt ur wax over it <br>  the frame has to be in a kind of cylindrial in shape , add diff colours if u like or some extrernal designs<br>  and melt it til there is a conical head <br>  let it cool; 1st  time u get great outputs but wid practice  u will soon learn a lot|`|8cc4c1bd3e87012631beee907ce611e1aa	if you want two coloured candle,pour the part of colour 2 after part 1 cools down|`|968bc7c8dfa5c8ee23e19a7e540db963aa	Candles can be made of paraffin (a byproduct of petroleum refining), stearin (now produced almost exclusively from palm waxes), beeswax (a byproduct of honey collection), gel (a mixture of resin and mineral oil), some plant waxes (generally palm, carnauba, bayberry, or soy), or tallow (rarely used since the introduction of affordable wax alternatives). Candles are produced in various colors, shapes, sizes and scents. The most basic production method generally entails the liquification of the solid fuel by the controlled application of heat. This liquid is then poured into a mold to produce pillar candles, a fireproof jar to produce container candles, or a wick is repeatedly immersed in the liquid to create a dipped taper. Often, fragrance oils are added to the liquid wax prior to pouring. Natural scents, in the form of essential oils, can be used, but these are usually only found in premium, small-run candles. Candles may also be colored by the addition of some sort of coloring agent. In practical terms this is almost always an aniline-based dye, although pigments can be used in some circumstances.<br>  <br>  A candle typically produces about 13 lumens of visible light and 40 watts of heat, although this can vary depending primarily on the characteristics of the candle wick. For comparison, note that a 40 watt incandescent light bulb produces approximately 500 lumens for the same amount of power. The modern SI unit of luminous intensity, the candela, was based on an older unit called the candlepower, which represented the luminous intensity emitted by a candle made to particular specifications (a "standard candle"). The modern unit is defined in a more precise and repeatable way, but was chosen such that a candle's luminous intensity is still about one candela.<br>  <br>   <br>  Floating candlesIt is commonly believed that candles made of beeswax and/or soy burn more cleanly than petroleum based paraffin waxes. However highly-refined paraffin wax can burn as or more cleanly (with regards to particulates created during combustion) than natural waxes. The type of wick and inclusion of any scents and/or dyes have a much greater impact on the release of volatile compounds, particulates, and soot, regardless of the base material. The cleanest burning candles will therefore be unscented, undyed, and well constructed candles burning in a draft free area.|`|0e0eef5543689f069dde47e22abac164aa	candles are easy to make and even easier to clean up after making them. After learning the basics, the sky is the limit to what else you can do with these materials.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You need to decide if you want to make a stacked candle or a rolled candle.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to make a rolled candle, you will first need to decide how tall you want your candle to be. If you want a 4-inch tall candle, then use the ruler to mark 4 inches at either of the end of the sheet of bee wax. Place the wax on a cutting board and using a straight edge cut the length of wax. How thick your candle will be depends on how many strips you add (for a votive size candle, I used 2 strips of wax, 3 inches by 18 inches). With one length of wax in front of you, cut a piece of wick to be the height of the candle plus 1 inch. (With a 4-inch candle the wick would be 5 inches.) At one end of the wax strip, heat up the wax with the hairdryer until it is soft. Press the wick into the wax with one end even with the edge of the wax and the extra inch hanging over the edge. Heat up a few inches of the wax and using your fingertips start to roll the wax, first wrapping the wax around the wick and then rolling the wax up. The tighter the roll, the longer the candle will burn, and the longer the candle will remain rolled. While rolling, press the wax together (with gentle pressure) to make a tighter roll. Every few inches, pause and heat the wax with the hairdryer. When you come to the end of the strip, press the edge into the wax. If you want the candle to be thicker, add another strip. Butt up the ends of the old, rolled strip to the new strip. Use your fingertips to press the two ends together and to the wax below. Keep heating and rolling like before. Add as many strips as you want to make the candle you want. Once at the end of the last strip you want to add, make sure you heat up the edge of the strip and really press it into the wax to seal the end.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to make a stacked candle, you need to choose a shape like a cube or a triangle where all the wax shapes are of the same size. On a flat cutting board use a utility knife and a ruler to cut the bee wax sheet into the shape you want your candle to be. How many layers you add depends on how thick you want the candle to be. You will need an even number of pieces. Once you have all of the pieces cut, pick out two of the pieces and place them in front of you. Cut a length of wick that is one inch longer than the pieces of wax. Using a hair dryer, warm up the two pieces of wax so that they are soft to the touch. Place the wick in the middle of one of the pieces with one end of the wick even with the bottom of the piece and one inch hanging over the other side. Press the wick into the softened wax. Then place the other piece on top and press the two wax sheets together. The closer they are pressed together, the longer it will take the candle to burn and the longer the candle will hold together. Use the hairdryer to warm up another sheet and add it by pressing it to the sheets already together. Build up the candle evenly on both sides so that the wick remains in the middle. Keep adding as many layers as you want until you have the shape you want for your candle.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can also make a stacked candle by using wax pieces that gradually get smaller. Just make sure you cut the pieces in pairs so you can put one on either side of the wick. Start with the two largest pieces and work your way down to the smallest pieces.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you are worried that the candle will not hold together, you can heat up a cookie tray and melt the bottom of the candle to make sure it does not come apart. (I have never felt the need to do this. I wrap the candles very tightly and even after 10 years the candles I made for my wedding are still together.)<br>  <br>  <br>  If you are going to burn the candles, trim the wick to ? inch and make sure you have a plate under the candle to catch the melting wax. If you are giving the candles away, make sure the new owner knows to trim the wick and to place something under the candle while it burns. (And of course, never leave a burning candle unattended.)<br>  <br>  <br>  I have added sprinkles to the candles or smaller pieces of different colored wax while they are still warm.  I have also glued paper, beads and other decorations to candles. How you decorate the candles you have made is up to you and your imagination.

At the moment of impact, the KE is converted once again to PE because the ball actually stops momentarily.  If the surface has absorbing properties, then the surface "takes in" a great deal of the energy.   The ball cannot bounce as much because it no longer has energy to do so.  Eventually, all of the KE will become PE, which means the ball is again at rest.|`|AA12361196	Flubber goes higher and higher.|`|AA10164958	It depends on how solid the surface is.

1f835a30228542e4408502a88775ab95aa	Covering approximately 700 square miles of South Georgia and North Florida is a bowl-shaped depression in the coastal plain called The Okefenokee Swamp. Twenty five miles across and forty miles long, Okefenokee is a unique area of primitive wetland which harbors hundreds of birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians, many of which are endangered or threatened. Plant life in the Okefenokee varies from towering bald cypress to a seemingly infinite variety of water plants. Many of the plants found in the Okefenokee were used by the Indian inhabitants for food and medicine, long before the first Europeans arrived in the area. Early settlers learned from their Indian hosts the value of natural life and balance with nature. <br>  <br>  The Okefenokee is comprised of a variety of habitats. The north end of the swamp is bordered by pine forests and thick tangles of vegetation. Small water trails lead south to the open prairies and west to the Suwannee River. Nearly 400,000 acres of this land were designated as the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge in 1937, protecting the headwaters of the Suwannee and St. Marys Rivers from further human development. Because of this action, both rivers are among the most beautiful watersheds in the southeastern United States. The Suwannee exits the southwest corner of the Okefenokee and drains the swamp to the Gulf of Mexico while the St. Marys forms the Georgia / Florida state line flowing east to Cumberland Sound and the Atlantic Ocean. Both rivers carry clean, nutrient rich water across the coastal plain to the sea.<br>  <br>  Visitors to the Okefenokee Swamp find The Inn at Folkston Bed and Breakfast to be the ideal place to stay while visiting the swamp. Located just ten miles from the eastern entrance, The Inn at Folkston is a delightful refuge after a day in the Okefenokee. With four spacious guest rooms, the inn has a room to fit everyone's needs, including two luxury king rooms, a standard queen, and a family room with two beds. Innkeepers Roger and Genna Wangsness provide a warm welcome and special attention -- unmatched hospitality that has made The Inn at Folkston a favorite among inn lovers everywhere. <br>  <br>  Let The Inn at Folkston and the Okefenokee Swamp enchant you with a serenity found only in special places. In south Georgia, the quiet of the Okefenokee's dark still waters are synonymous with the sense of peace and tranquility that awaits you when you walk through the doors of The Inn at Folkston. From the moment you pass the Inn's Garden of Meditation with its gently flowing water fountain, your cares will drift away. <br>  <br>  Visit The Inn at Folkston Home Page<br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Location and Directions <br>  There are three major entrances to the Okefenokee, each with its own facilities and special character. From the open, wet "prairies" of the east side to the forested cypress swamps in the west, Okefenokee is a mosaic of habitats, plants, and wildlife. <br>  <br>  Hours:<br>  <br>  <br>  November 1 through the end of February, the Refuge opens half an hour before sunrise and closes at 5:30 PM. <br>  From March 1 through the end of October, opening hours are half an hour before sunrise and closing is at 7:30 PM. <br>  Perimeter roads through the towns of Folkston, St. George, Fargo, Homerville, Waycross and Racepond encircle the swamp providing access to the interior. <br>  <br>  East Entrance<br>  The main U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service entrance to the swamp, the Suwannee Canal Recreation Area, is located 7 miles southwest of FOLKSTON, Georgia, off Highway 121/23. It is only a 10 minute drive from The Inn at Folkston to the eastern entrance (directions). When you arrive, stop in the newly renovated Visitors Center to plan your day. This entrance provides the 9-mile long driving, biking, and walking Swamp Island Drive, a 3/4 mile wooden walkway, The Swamp Walk, leading to a 50-foot high observation tower overlooking the swamp, guided boat tours, motorboat, kayak and canoe rentals, and the restored Chesser Island Homestead. For visitor information, call 912-496-7836, or for boat rental information, call 912-496-7156 or 866-THE-SWAMP or okefenokeeadventures.com. <br>  <br>  West Entrance<br>  Stephen C. Foster State Park is located 17 miles east of FARGO, Georgia, on Highway Spur 177. Camping and cabins are available at the state park, as well as a boardwalk, boating trails, fishing, guided boat tours, motorboat and canoe rentals, interpretive programs, and a museum. For cabin reservations, call 1-800-864-7275 and for visitor information, call 912-637-5274. It is an 85 mile drive to get to the state park from Folkston, so plan a little over an hour to get there. <br>  <br>  North Entrance<br>  The private, nonprofit Okefenokee Swamp Park is located 8 miles south of WAYCROSS, Georgia, off US 1. The park offers interpretive displays, a boardwalk and observation tower, boat tours, animal habitats, lectures, and the diesel-powered Lady Suwannee, a replica of a steam engine, which pulls four cars along a 1.5 mile loop. The swamp park is home to Walt Kelly's Pogo. A park for all ages, we recommend this park for families with younger children who like a theme park environment. Boat trails are not connected to the rest of the refuge boat system. For information call the swamp park at 912-283-0583. Visit their web site at www.okeswamp.com. The Swamp Park is a 30 minute drive from The Inn at Folkston. <br>  <br>  World-renowned herpetology expert Okefenokee Joe spent an early part of his career at the Okefenokee Swamp Park. Visit his web site at www.okefenokeejoe.com. <br>  <br>  Other Entrances<br>  There are two additional entrances to the swamp which have boat ramps, parking areas, information boards and sign-in sheets. Sill Landing is located off the road to the Stephen Foster State Park. And Kingfisher Landing is located off US 1 between Waycross and Folkston. <br>  <br>  Day Trips into the Swamp <br>  The majority of visitors to the swamp take day trips into the interior. Boat rentals are available at the three main entrances. Guided group tours of one or two hours are available, or visitors may rent canoes, kayaks, or motor boats for all day travel within the swamp. Call the numbers above for information. Private educational all-day tours can be arranged. (private tours) <br>  <br>  Wilderness Canoeing <br>  While the most popular excursions into the swamp are day trips by canoe, kayak, or motor boat, nothing quite compares to an overnight canoe trip into the swamp, an experience that will be remembered for a lifetime! There are seven designated stops within the swamp. Only seven groups may be in the swamp on a given night. Consider the skill level of individuals in your party before choosing a trail. The swamp terrain is flat, there is no fast water and very little dry land. Your paddle will be used every inch of the way as you wind through cypress forests or cross open "prairies" exposed to the sun and wind. Paddling can be slow and strenuous on shallow and/or narrow trails. You may have to get out of your canoe and push across peat blowups or shallow water. Water levels in the swamp sometimes become too low to paddle on certain trails. When this occurs, reservation holders are notified. Swamp conditions may dictate closing certain trails, as has happened in spring of both '98 and '99. <br>  <br>  Summer days are hot and humid with high temperatures and humidity and warm nights. Winter days range from the teens to 80 degrees, but mostly in the the 50s and 60s. Nighttime temperatures can be near or below freezing and wind chills have reached -22 degrees. Spring and fall are unpredictable -- be prepared for any weather extreme. It is recommended that you check local forecasts before leaving (www.weather.com) for zip code 31537. The rainy season is normally from June through September. Many summer afternoons are drenched with localized thunderstorms. Lightning is probably the most dangerous feature of an Okefenokee experience. If you are in an exposed area, seek shelter immediately in a nearby shrub island without trees. Get away from the boat and stay low under the canopy. <br>  <br>  In general, mosquitoes are not a problem except after dark. They are rarely encountered during the daytime. Deerflies, although a biting menace at times during the summer, are not as numerous deep in the swamp. During May and June, biting yellow flies can make a trip into the swamp unpleasant. <br>  <br>  Camping overnight is allowed only with a permit, which is issued through the refuge office in Folkston. Reservations can be made only within two months to the day your trip begins. To make a reservation, call 912-496-3331 between 7 A.M. and 10 A.M. Monday through Friday (closed federal holidays). Reservations can be made only by phone, no walk-in registrations are accepted. After 10 A.M. you may request information, but reservations will not be taken. Groups are limited to 20 people. For complete information about wilderness canoeing, call the refuge office at the above number. They can provide you with further information, including the very informative "Wilderness Canoeing" pamphlet. <br>  <br>  Some information on this page is taken from refuge guides. While we have done our best to be accurate, be sure to go by the information received from the refuge office, since regulations and conditions are subject to change. <br>  <br>  Acknowledgments <br>  US Fish and Wildlife Service brochures were used for some information provided in this section on the Okefenokee.

You can split the fractions by using the rule log(a/b) = loga - logb (example  log3/4 = log3 - log4).  You can also split something with factors by the rule log(ab) = loga + logb (example log 21 = log3 + log7).

Las nubes de desarrollo vertical provocan la acumulación de cargas eléctricas enormes en distintos puntos de la atmósfera. <br>  <br>  A veces se producen resplandores análogos a los rayos que se observan en el horizonte, incluso con cielo despejado, que se conocen con el nombre de relámpagos de calor. <br>      <br>   Estos son el reflejo de rayos de primera clase, pero producidos en zonas tan alejadas que no se perciben ni el trueno ni el cumulonimbo de la tormenta.<br>     <br>   Los relámpagos más intensos son los que se producen entre las nubes y el suelo. Se los conoce con el nombre de relámpagos bifurcados y son los que causan los principales da?os. <br>  <br>     Pero de cada seis descargas, cinco no tocan el suelo nunca: resplandecen entre una parte y otra de una nube. Son igual de bifurcados que los anteriores, pero menos intensos, y suelen estar ocultos a la vista por la propia nube; se perciben como una luz titilante en la parte superior de la misma y se denominan relámpagos difusos. La diferencia entre un relámpago bifurcado y otro difuso no radica en su forma, sino en como se ven: si los rayos que alcanzan el suelo estuvieran ocultos a la vista, se llamarían también relámpagos difusos.<br>  <br>    Otro tipo de fenómeno son los rayos nube a nube, que provocan un espectáculo impresionante, especialmente si se producen a gran altura y están acompa?ados poco o nada de lluvia o truenos, como cuando sucede a veces durante las grandes olas de calor veraniegas o en las regiones tropicales.<br>  <br>  El relámpago "ensartado", bastante insólito, persiste durante algunos segundos, pareciendo luego desintegrarse en una hilera de fragmentos luminosos que se desvanecen gradualmente.|`|evsSWUQJaa	si lo tocan|`|OceYrdz3aa	los rayos son atraidos por la energia negativa de la tierra y que suelen trasladarse a elementos que sobresalen del suelo como árboles, antenas, etc.|`|2ee9e10894ca4e3cbc0df326a6a00076aa	si, sí tocan el suelo.|`|f0fe6100b49f3e6957e0a247dbe05e68aa	los rayos se deben a la friccion del vapor de agua de las nubes con el aire, creando electricidad estatica, al ser una carga positiva busca la carga negativa de la tierra para descargarse, esa descarga es el rayo<br>  la carga negativa proviene de la tierra, asi que si tocan el suelo...!|`|jm6bt1slaa	realmente los rayos comienzan en el suelo y suben...raro no? pareciera al reves|`|893a566a80ffdd030d8dda422b883e3caa	Quien te ha dicho que no lo tocan????? , te sugiero sintonizar con mayor frecuencia Discovery Channel.<br>  Ssaludos.

UcAQzunraa	There ar two ways that I can think of doing it.  One would be to use the Pythagorean Therom.  If you sketch a coordinate plane with our point (5, -6), you can see that you can form a right triangle by connecting all the points together.  Your x-value values serves as the length of one leg, and your y-value serves as the length of the other leg of the right triangle.  The distance from the origin will be the length of the hypotentuse.  By setting up the equation you should have:<br>  <br>  a^2 + b^2 = c^2<br>  (5)^2 + (-6)^2 = c^2<br>  c = √(25 + 36)<br>  c = √61<br>  c = 7.819249....<br>  <br>  The other way I could think of doing this is by using the distance formula.  You are given one point and kind of have to infer the other point.  You know that you are starting at the origin, so that can also be represented by (0,0).  <br>  <br>  d = √(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2<br>  d = √(5 - 0)^2 + (-6 - 0)^2<br>  d = √5^2 + (-6)^2<br>  d = √61<br>  d = 7.819249....<br>  <br>  It amounts to the same thing, but just a different way of looking at it.  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|AA12283307	The answer is ....<br>  sqrt61|`|a402b2b934220e25a01eaaaa8e616ea9aa	Pont, P ( x1 = 5, y1 = -6)<br>  <br>  origin, O (x2 = 0, y2 = 0)<br>  <br>  length of OP = sqrt[(x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2]<br>  <br>  = sqrt[(5)^2 + (-6)^2]<br>  <br>  =sqrt(25 + 36)<br>  <br>  = sqrt(61) units|`|90afa2d201dede956103eaf302b29d0eaa	Use the distance formula.<br>  <br>  If you have two points (a, b) and (c, d), the distance formula is<br>  <br>  distance = sqrt [(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2]<br>  <br>  *******<br>  In your case, you have the origin which is point (0, 0) and a given point.<br>  <br>  So...<br>  <br>  d = sqrt [(5 - 0)^2 + (-6 - 0)^2]<br>  = sqrt [(5)^2 + (-6)^2]<br>  = sqrt (25 + 36)<br>  = sqrt 61

USFNeE4gaa	If somebody is given a transfusion of incompatible blood, then their immune system reacts to it as it does to any foreign material that enters the body.  Antibodies bind to the transfused cells, causing them to break down rapidly.  This can cause a reaction in the body like shock, with high fevers and a dangerous drop in blood pressure.  Also, the elevation in the blood stream of some of the substances inside cells (such as potassium) can become dangerously high.  The kidneys try and filter the hemoglobin released by the destruction of the red cells, which can cause significant damage to the kidney structure and result in renal failure.|`|4mENmI7Uaa	the person who recieved the B blood would have a reaction and his/her blood would coagulate (clot). this is because blood type A has antibodies in the blood plasma for blood type B so these would bind to the B blood types red cell antigens and clot the blood.|`|VHbQ19sWaa	Their body would reject the blood, and the blood would be useless.|`|kWHutmixaa	organs dont accept it, it dosnt absorb oxygen to provide your body with it, so you die (basically)

gkCXWshTaa	The transmission electron microscope (TEM) works by transmitting a beam of electrons through a specimen. Only those electrons that are passed through the specimen are seen. This allows us to see inside the cells so that we can observe the structures present inside a cell. Examples of structures that can be seen are:- mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus.<br>  <br>  In the scanning electron microscope (SEM), the electron beam is used to scan the surfaces of structures, and only the reflected beam is observed. So it allows us to view the surface structures of a cell. The image created has a 3-dimensional appearance.<br>  <br>  If you go this page, you can view the images produced from the TEM and SEM of the same structure to help you understand better what I explained:<br>  <a href="http://fig.cox.miami.edu/~cmallery/150/proceuc/temvsem.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://fig.cox.miami.edu/~cmallery/150/p...</a>|`|bwj6EYMBaa	Scanning EM is used to see the 3-D shape of a micro-organism, such as looking at shape of a virus.

8bDGrbzoaa	It's one of the major types of proof in mathematics, used for statements which are supposed to be true for all positive integers, n.<br>  For example: 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + n = n(n+1)/2.  ***<br>  What the proof entails is to show the statement true for some early case, n = 1, for example, but not necessarily for n = 1. Plenty of times you start with 2 or higher. But you want to show it true for a specific early case. In the above example we can choose n = 1. The left side of *** has to be shown equal to the right side. The left side, for n = 1 says go start off at the first term "1" and go to "n" which in our case is 1, so we only have the one term. So the lhs = 1. The rhs with n = 1<br>  is 1*2/2 =1. The lhs and rhs agree.<br>  Now the second part of the proof is always the easiest. You assume the statement true for n = k. So you just rewrite the statement replacing n by k, and we assume this is true:<br>  1 + 2 + . . . + k = k(k+1)/2    &&&<br>  The third part: Based on this assumption prove the statement true for n = k+1. So the rhs for n = k + 1 will look like:<br>  1 + 2 + . . .  + k + (k + 1). Now I make use of &&&<br>  = k(k + 1)/2       + (k + 1).<br>  When you simplify this you arrive at (k +1)/(k +2)/2<br>  Which is the rhs of *** with n = k + 1<br>  So you've proved the truth of *** for k + 1 based on its truth for k. And tha finishes the proof.

Dal punto di vista chimico, una proteina è un polimero (o anche una macromolecola) costituita da una combinazione variabile di diversi monomeri detti amminoacidi, uniti mediante un LEGAME PEPTIDICO, spesso in associazione con altre molecole e/o ioni metallici (in questo caso si parla di proteina coniugata). Le proteine hanno una organizzazione tridimensionale (struttura) molto complessa a cui è associata sempre una funzione biologica. Da questa considerazione deriva uno dei dogmi fondamentali della biologia: "Struttura <--> Funzione", nel senso che ad ogni diversa organizzazione strutturale posseduta da una proteina (detta proteina nativa) è associata un specifica funzione biologica. Da questo punto di vista le proteine possono essere classificate in due grandi famiglie: le proteine globulari e le proteine a struttura estesa o fibrosa. Queste due organizzazioni riflettono le due grosse separazioni funzionali che le contraddistinguono. Le proteine estese o fibrose svolgono funzioni generalmente biomeccaniche, esse per es. rientrano nella costituzione delle unghie, dei peli, dello strato corneo dell'epidermide, ecc., opponendo una valida difesa contro il mondo esterno. Al contrario, le proteine globulari sono coinvolte in specifiche e molteplici funzioni biologiche, spesso di notevole importanza per l'economia cellulare, per es. sono proteine gli enzimi, i pigmenti respiratori, molti ormoni e gli anticorpi, responsabili della difesa immunitaria.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  Il legame peptidico è il legame chimico responsabile dell'unione degli amminoacidi e della conseguente formazione di polipeptidi e proteine. Come quasi tutti i legami che avvengono nelle molecole organiche e in generale nella chimica biologica, si tratta di un legame di tipo covalente.<br>  Il legame peptidico si genera nel momento in cui, tramite un processo di condensazione (ovvero l'unione di due strutture molecolari con la perdita di una molecola di H2O), la parte basica di un amminoacido (il gruppo funzionale amminico -NH2) si unisce con quella acida di un amminoacido diverso (il gruppo carbossilico -COOH). Quando ciò avviene, uno degli idrogeni (H+) legati all'azoto si separa e si unisce al gruppo OH- legato al carbonio formando una molecola d'acqua e permettendo a C e ad N di unirsi con un legame semplice detto appunto peptidico.<br>  <br>  Siccome un dipeptide (ovvero una molecola che possiede un solo legame peptidico tra due amminoacidi), così come pure i polipeptidi, comprende ancora nella sua molecola sia un gruppo amminico che uno carbossilico, esso potrebbe nuovamente allungarsi in seguito ad altre condensazioni dando luogo, qualora il numero di amminoacidi uniti superasse la trentina, ad una proteina.<br>  L'idrolisi enzimatica è il sistema più semplice per rompere un legame peptidico, poiché consiste nell'operazione esattamente contraria alla condensazione: con l'aggiunta di acqua e l'azione di un enzima si passa dai prodotti ai reagenti, quindi dal dipeptide ai due amminoacidi separati; questa reazione è sfruttata dal fegato per tramutare le proteine ingerite in quelle a noi necessarie.<br>  Buon lavoroooo!!!

r7HOZixWaa	Funny you should ask this as i just had this lecture in my neural control of movement class.<br>  <br>  depends on whether this is procedural or declarative memory that you are using. <br>  If those notes are brand new to you then then you will be using a lot of your medial temporal lobe. This area is associated with declarative memory.<br>  <br>   However if you are somewhat familiar with this and are using procedural memory you will be using your sensory (dorsal) such as V1 - V4 since a lot of "in your head" playing requires you to either visualize the keyboard or some image that you have associated with the music. If you are imagining playing those notes then pre-motor (ventral) areas also. Imagining studies have shown a 30% overlap between an actual execution of a movement and an imagery practice of the movement.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the areas we see activity on are mainly focused on "executing" the plan (such as playing notes in your head). The actual location of long term memory storage is so disperse it has not been pinpointed to one area yet.

Adult domestic cats continue to use voice sounds mainly because humans can't understand scent or body language as well as cats can, being more attuned to voice communication.  Cats are adaptable enough to recognize this.  Adult feral cats do very little voice communication besides the yowling and screaming associated with passion.<br>  There are exceptions among domestic cats; Siamese and part-Siamese cats "talk" a lot more than others.  They use it to get attention, to let you know they want something (eg food, petting, or to be let in or out). <br>  I have a "talking" cat and a quiet cat; the older quiet cat has learned from the effectiveness of the talking cat, and she also now meows for what she wants, though her voice is softer.<br>  There is often a call-and-response aspect to it the talking cat's communication with me, the cat imitating my intonations.  <br>  The talking cat also meows to signal the dogs that she wants to be chased.  <br>  The churring sound is a kind of motherly or affectionate sound, used primarily toward kittens, but cats can use it toward others as well, including their people.  <br>  Cats seem quite interested in the behavior of other species, and they adapt their own behavior based on these observations.<br>  |`|NbfPOG9eaa	It means they want attention.

For example if you look at fish. There is fish every where in the ocean. There are those at poles (cold climate) and those at worm temperatures.

E.g polar bears where evolved to face low temperatures. Did you ever think why africans are black and the rest are white.

"…we all started the process at the same time, and all came from the same place..." "...we are all subjected to the same environment...<br>  <br>  This is not right, rather, we all share one common ancestor from 3.5 billion years ago that evolved in an environment that no longer exists. Populations of this one common ancestor (there may actually have been several) branched and branched again and again and eventually populated the globe with a huge variety. Populations became far dispersed and experienced radically different environmental pressures including, on more than one occasion, global catastrophes, mass extinctions, shifting continents, rising mountain chains, desertification, floods, volcanoes, earthquakes, ice ages, meteor strikes, etc. There is no way that we are all subjected to the same environment! And there is no way we all started at the same time or same place. The earth continues to change over time and “we” – the human race – are relative newcomers. After a long line of descent through the early mammals to the diversification of primates, we survived in our own niche that varied, just like everything else, over time. Our exact genetic descent and the local environment that we evolved in will never be reproduced – it’s the same with just about all species.<br>  <br>  Evolution states that the individuals in a population with the best genes to survive and reproduce in the local environment will produce more offspring than others. Thus those genes that led to survival and better reproduction become more concentrated in a population. This is natural selection – the environment “allows” individuals with the “best” genes to reproduce more, and the best genes come from the variety produced in a population by recombination, mutation, crossing over, and other genetic effects that accompany every generation. Another population of the exact same species living in a different area will experience a different environment so they will have a different set of “best” genes and will evolve along different lines. It’s exactly because we have NOT come from the same starting point or same environment that you see Earth’s great diversity.<br>  |`|f0JLp4hFaa	Hi Hypnotik,<br>  <br>  OK, let's say we start with a single-cell creature.  NOTE: we don't know how that first living thing got started, but that's not what the theory of evolution is about.<br>  <br>  So, our single-cell creature divides and divides, eating some organic molecule.  But then one of the creatures mutates to eat a different, more abundant molecule.  Both species exist, one eating one thing, one another.  They multiply over a LONG time, some mutating to be able to move, some mutating to eat other single-cell creatures, some mutating to process sunlight into food.  There's food for all of them, so they all live side by side.  This change/adaptation keeps happening in little steps, in different groups, that spread into different environments, and so on and so on.  Keep doing that over millions of years, and you get all the species we have today.<br>  <br>  And to respond to the people that say "why aren't monkeys evolving into humans" - that's silly.  Humans, monkeys, and even today's bacteria, are all EQUALLY EVOLVED.  They each fit their environments really really well.  Monkeys are evolved to live in trees, and most to eat bugs and plants and fruit.  Humans evolved to live in the plains and hunt.  Bacteria eat ... well.. everything, and they do it really well.<br>  <br>  Even today's single-celled creatures are MUCH more advanced than those first few creatures 3.5 billion years ago.<br>  <br>  Every species is still evolving, and every species is equally evolved to it's ecological niche at this point in the history of life.<br>  <br>

Lo llaman "dragón" porque su saliva "quema", no literalmente por supuesto. Su saliva es un cultivo terrible de bacterias muy agresivas, que descomponen la carne. Generalmente el modo de caza es que muerden y esperan a que en un par de días el animal mordido muera de infección. De ahí el nombre. Comen lo que tengan a mano y puedan, son carnívoros y viven los primeros dos a tres a?os de vida en un árbol, comiendo insectos, hasta que son lo suficientemente fuertes como para bajar a pelear territorio. Nadan a una respetable velocidad y corren rápido. Han sido el terror de los marinos que encallaron en la isla durante muchos siglos.

h3Xbi8fVaa	Hi I go to uni doing Chemistry and for me it was the one of the hardest standard grades and highers because there was just more to learn than other subjects. I got a 1 at S Grade and a B at higher.    All my teachers also said that it would be easier to crash biology than chemistry (even the biology teachers) so I think it is one of the hardest highers, if not the hardest that you could crash in my opinion. I remember finding it tough and failed my prelim (I worked my *** off for 2 months solid to get that B). I really think your friends have a point.    That said if you work at it and can be done. My girlfriend crashed it and got a C (in my opinion a good grade considering).    I am not saying don't go for it and I don't mean to be too negative cause I love chemistry and do it 8 hours a day every day but I feel it is more important to give you a realistic opinion of what you would be getting in to. A good upside is that if your good at maths and good at biology then it's a start. My strongest piece of advice if you decide to do it (other than study all year) would be to read up on S Grade chem over summer. Learn the basics.    Any questions let me know.    EDIT: It bleeped a s s.....what if i was talking about donkeys eh?|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	It shouldn't be that bad, I managed to crash Biology in my 6th year even though I hadn't touched it since second year.

Then solve for the remaining term. Use this to solve for the other term.    a) 3a + 5b = 1  3a + 2b = 8  Subtract the bottom equation from the top equation to get  3b = -7  b =-7/3  Now use this to solve for a(using either of the original equations)  3a +5b =1  3a +5(-7/3) =1  3a -35/3 =1   3a = 38/3  a =38/9      ______________________________________...  b) 5a - 4b = 23  3a + 4b = 1  Now the b- terms are negative of each, so instead of subtracting, you can add then together and remove the b-terms  8a =24  a =3  and then use the value of a to solve for b    ______________________________________...    If none of the terms have the same coefficients, then you can multiply one of the equations by a constant so that they do match.    f) 11a - 9b = 7  4a + 3b = -14  multiply the bottom equation by 3  11a -9b =7  12a +9b =-42  And then add them together  23a = -35    ______________________________________...

It's generally easier if you put the bigger one on the top as it avoids negatives. If both signs are different, you add the equations. It's best to get one kind of term on its own, so you're left with either all a's or all b's once you've done your sum. To acheive this, you sometimes have to tweak your equation.    For instance, in D, if you wanmted to get the b's on their own, you'd times the whole of the first equation by two to ge 8a+6b=-21.

8YwdQASjaa	Find the right number that will cancel out a variable. For example:    3x + 5y = 9  4x + y = -2    It may be easiest if we get rid of y first in this equation so multiply the bottom equation by -5. That way, the 5y from the top and the -5y from the bottom cancel each other out.    3x + 5y = 9  20x - 5y = 10  _________  23x = 19    And so on...  y won't always be the easiest to get out first.

AA11847539	Thermal conductivity for air varies based upon its temperature. It is usually listed as about 0.025 which is in watts per meter per degree C. So I believe the conductivity for 127 mm would just be 0.127 x 0.025.<br>  You will need to crunch the numbers to get the units you need.<br>  However, U value is based upon conduction; with air there will also be convection, since it is not a rigid insulator.<br>  See links below.<br>  Good luck.<br>  Bill
LrBvhEyraa	I agree with Spike. You must specify the heat rejection<br>  <br>  Fourier's Law of Heat conduction <br>  <br>  Q = - k * A * dT/dx<br>  <br>  Here, Q = Heat load<br>  k = Thermal Conductivity (0.17 W/mK in your case)<br>  A = Surface area of the board (We can assume 1 m^2 as the basis)<br>  dT = Temperature gradient ( 250 - 70 = 180 C)<br>  dx = Thickness of board (0.04 m)<br>  <br>  The negative sign is to indicate the direction of heat flow, it is irrelevant for heat load calculations. Remember that thermal conductivity usually varies with temperature. <br>  <br>  Substituting<br>  <br>  Q = 0.17 * 1 * 180/0.04 = 765 W/m^2<br>  <br>  Now, if the machine at 70 C is rejecting heat at a rate of 765 W/m^2, then you can use 40 mm slabs for insulation. You need to find out the heat rejection rate for the machine.<br>  <br>  The above calculations are assuming that the insulation slabs are directly coupled to the machine, if there is an open air space in between the machine and the slabs than you have to consider conductivity for the air too, besides you also need to find out the heat loss by convection.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: I am not sure if this is applicable, but one way of calculating the Q in your case would be<br>  <br>  Q = m * Cp * dT<br>  <br>  m = mass of your machine<br>  Cp = Specific heat for the Material of Construction (MOC) of machine<br>  dT = Delta T = Temperature Gradient ( 250 - 70 = 180 C)<br>  <br>  Now, you absolutely cannot determine the specific heat for the machine if it has parts made from different materials unless the manufacturer has provided you the details of all the materials used in the machine. You will have to assume some value, say if it is made of Stainless Steel having Cp = 500 J/kg.C|`|tba9SGYDaa	You need to specify the rate of heat rejection. <br>  <br>  The rate of conduction through the insulation would be:<br>  Qconduction=(k/L)(Troom-Tinterior)  <br>   {Fourier Law of conduction}<br>  the answer would be in Watts/ meter^2<br>  <br>  Since you know you want to achieve a temperature of 70 degrees you can calculate Qconduction.<br>  <br>  Next perform an energy balance on the control volume of the machine.

This means that the light photons don't pass right through the material in a direct path -- the material's particles change the light's direction. This happens because the distances between some atoms in the ice's molecular structure are close to the height of light wavelengths, which means the light photons will interact with the structures. The result is that the light photon's path is altered and it exits the ice in a different direction than it entered the ice.     Snow is a whole bunch of individual ice crystals arranged together. When a light photon enters a layer of snow, it goes through an ice crystal on the top, which changes its direction slightly and sends it on to a new ice crystal, which does the same thing. Basically, all the crystals bounce the light all around so that it comes right back out of the snow pile. It does the same thing to all the different light frequencies, so all colors of light are bounced back out. The "color" of all the frequencies in the visible spectrum combined in equal measure is white, so this is the color we see in snow, while it's not the color we see in the individual ice crystals that form snow.|`|TpK2RHVnaa	Same reason the clouds look white even though they're just made from water vapor.

Km9QC8a9aa	The acceleration due to gravity is a constant -9.8 m/s^2.    That means that the rock takes exactly the same amount of time to go up that it takes to come down.    The interval going past the window is 1.60 s.  That means 0.80 s up and 0.80 s down.    Total time going up is thus 0.8 s + 0.4 s = 1.2 s.  Thus total time coming down is 1.2 s.  At the top of its flight the final velocity was 0 m/s    You can calculate initial velocity from this information using the equation:    v(i) = v(f) - at =  0 m/s - (-9.8 m/s^2 * 1.2 s)    Figure out for yourself whether the height of the window matters.

9YOnceXnaa	Basically, yes!  The equilibrium constant, Kc, is constant for a given temperature.  If you put some reactants and products which will form an equilibrium into a beaker they will react with each other to form an equilibrium mixture where [products] / [reactants] = Kc.    If you have a high concentration of reactants but a low concentration of products they will react to form a mixture where [products] / [reactants] = Kc.  Similarly, if you have a LOW concentration of reactants and a HIGH concentration of products they will react to form a mixture where [products] / [reactants] = Kc.  This is the basic principle of equilibria.      N.B. the "[ ]" notation is short hand for concentration of whatever's in the brackets.

There are 85/28 or 3.04 moles of CO and 12.6/2 or 6.3 moles of H2. <br>  <br>  You need double the amount of H2 as you need CO, so divide the number of H2 by 2 to give you moles of 2H2. You then get 3.15, meaning you will have 3.15 - 3.04 or .11 moles of 2H2 remaining. This means you have .22 moles H2<br>  <br>  .22 moles times the molar weight of 2 gives you .44 g H2 gas excess.
FUPYQkHoaa	Well, you can't compare grams to molecules unless you first convert to moles (using molar mass), and then convert to molecules (using Avogodros's number). But heres the catch. If you know something has the same number of molecules, then you know it has the same number of moles(since moles are simply 1 mole of molecules) <br>  <br>  If that was too complicated then follow this guide I wrote, which is much simpler and straight forward. Here's how to solve it:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Find the molar mass of CCl4. I'll go on and do it for you<br>  = 153.8 g/mol (yes only 4 sig figs)<br>  <br>  Take your number of grams CCl4(34.0 g) and divide it by the molar mass.(153.8 g/mol)<br>  <br>  Next take the number you just got (which is in moles) and note that you have that many number of moles of SO2.<br>  <br>  Now that you know how many moles of SO2 you have, multiply that number by the molar mass of SO2 to convert to moles of SO2 to grams of SO2.<br>  The molar mass of SO2 is 64.07 g/mol.<br>  <br>  After you multiply, you will have some number in grams SO2. That is your answer.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Unless what you are saying is that the 4 turns into 4/1...that's correct,  A whole number can always be written as a fraction by putting a 1 in the denominator.  So say you had the number 7 and it had to be written in fraction form, it would be written as 7/1  (a fraction is just another way of dividing so think 7 divided by 1 is what?  7)  So up in your example you would have 4/1 * 2/11 multiply the numerators and multiply he denominators 8/11.

Most of this energy is used opposing the force of friction (with road and car parts), air resistance etc. friction between these causes more energy to be lost as heat, and also as sound. The remaining energy moves the car.<br>  <br>  When we die, we can still be used as a fuel, if we are burnt we will release energy, therefore all mass has stored energy, this is given by Einsteins equation E=mc^2. When we burn, some of the energy is obviously lost as light and some goes into causing chemical reactions that make the substances our body is composed of react with other substances. <br>  <br>  If one wishes to completely convert a mass into its stored energy with 100% efficiency, we need to annihilate that mass with antimatter, this will give out pure energy.|`|mlxaZbz8aa	when we die, our body has chemical potential energy. bacteria and other  organisms eat it and it gives them energy. |`|1dzzgaGZaa	it gets dispersed into the environment as heat, or taken by bacteria as food, etc.|`|IslZC6uEaa	I'll spare your overtaxed brain.

Some people have claimed that these disappearances fall beyond the boundaries of human error or acts of nature. Popular culture has attributed some of these disappearances to the paranormal, a suspension of the laws of physics, or activity by extraterrestrial beings.Though a substantial body of documentation exists showing numerous incidents to have been inaccurately reported or embellished by later authors, and numerous official agencies have gone on record as stating the number and nature of disappearances to be similar to any other area of ocean, many have remained unexplained despite considerable investigation.<br>  <br>  Black mamba:<br>  <br>  The Black Mamba (nicknamed The Shadow of Death) (Dendroaspis polylepis), an elapid snake, is native to Somalia and northeastern Kenya[citation needed] and is one of Africa's most dangerous and feared snakes. It is also known for being very aggressive when disturbed or confronted and will not hesitate to strike with deadly precision.[1] The black mamba is the largest venomous snake in Africa and the second longest venomous snake in the world. Adult black mambas have an average length of 2.5 meters (8.2 ft) and a maximum length of 4.5 meters (~14 ft). Of the venomous snakes of the world, only the King Cobra is longer. [2] The name "black mamba" is somewhat confusing because it contradicts the snake's actual color. Its body is not black at all; the name is given to it because of its inky black mouth. Normally, mambas have a dark olive, olive green, greyish brown, or metal color. Some of them show a light banding around their body. As mambas get older, their skin begins to darken. The black mamba is reputed to be the fastest moving snake in the world, and has been claimed to move at up to 19.2 km/h (12 mph).<br>  <br>

hXO7xKkVaa	No..its there in Animals too|`|LGidAYDwaa	Any animal that normally has pigment can be albino - after all, it's just a genetic anomaly:  sometimes the animal just doesn't get the gene for pigmentation, which is what causes it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mdc.mo.gov/conmag/2005/06/10.htm" rel="nofollow">http://mdc.mo.gov/conmag/2005/06/10.htm</a> this is site with a lot of information about albinism in the animal world - plus it describes the three types of albinism. |`|AA10547511	Yes just about in every one that I know.|`|7m0D0UZhaa	albino is a rare form of where an animal or human is without pigmentation. It can happen in all animals and humans.

AA11373993	NZ is 15 hours ahead of us|`|LF2t9DPZaa	That depends on what day it is. Both EST and NZST are subject to Daylight Saving Time corrections. EST is UTC - 5, EDT is UTC - 4, NZST is UTC + 12, and NZDT is UTC + 13.<br>  <br>  So today, 8 PM in Eastern Time would be 2 PM tomorrow in New Zealand Time, because New Zealand is under DST and the United States is not.<br>  <br>  The exception would be the outlying Chatham Islands, which are always 45 minutes later than the rest of New Zealand.

AA11373993	I'm not sure. I think ribosomes. I know mitochondria makes energy (ATP)|`|kHwSTSM7aa	I think mitochondria because neclous can't be considered as organelle.|`|sgZ8oQdoaa	Probably ribosomes because they need a lot of eneregy to make proteins. Not sure though.
sBUfnIEoaa	once a day|`|mlI1YvCnaa	I take a shower in the morning, when I get home from work I take a bath followed by a shower, on the weekends I shower 1-2 times a day. y is this in weather? and yes I recommend everyone do as I do because my way is the right way!|`|bWTNXVS0aa	At least once a day for sedentary workers and twice a day for kids, athletes and laborers.  <br>  (Also, this has nothing to do with washing your hair which should be done daily for some people like me, and less often for other people. Its possible to wash your hair with conditioner only. Cheap conditioners have detergent ingredients in them too.)|`|koaBOBdCaa	Scientifically you are not supposed to shower once a day. Your body is designed to bring oils up through the skin to keep it moisturized and conditioned. By washing all the natural oils away you are not doing any good.<br>  <br>  If your body is dirty, obviously wash. Although many people seem to wash and scrub their skin and hair daily for no reason. This is one reason people get acne and pimples. If you wash away the natural oil the pores are left open allowing them to get clogged with dirt. If you let your body's natural oil rise it keeps your skin clean and healthy.<br>  <br>  It is recommended that complete bathing only occur once every 2-3 days unless needed. Cleaning of private areas and underarms can be done easily with a warm wash cloth as needed.|`|RXGTrTAfaa	it really depends on you. to stay clean and hygeinic one shower a day would be ideal. If you are a naturally hygeinic person, and your lifestyle doesnt include messy work, you could get away with a shower 3-4 times a week. <br>  SAVE WATER!|`|toqFiWcJaa	once a day. but sometimes you can't make one each day (you wake up too late in the mornign if you take them in the morning, etc)<br>  <br>  it really isn't bad to miss one day of showering. but be sure you take a shower soon though. missing more than 2 is waay bad.|`|6WwJf6jlaa	once a day preferably after work or school, before or 1 hour after dinner or some type of food, preferably 6 times a week, if not 5|`|WhtZeGmuaa	two a day...one in the morning to wake you up and get you all refreshed and one at night so you can jump into bed all clean|`|zvFgQyedaa	usually once a day, but you can get away with once every other day if you don't have very oily hair naturally.|`|v8yMbVgPaa	once every other day because there is something in shampoo that is not good for your scalp |`|UjcB7vReaa	Once a week. your suposed to wash your hair once every two days.|`|BzsU0hJyaa	daily|`|0llgEYkbaa	once a day -- at least|`|Sz259LyRaa	at least once a day

The curtain is just the tech that makes it efficient.<br>  <br>  Think of a helicopter with the blade on the bottom, sort of, to conceptualize that motion.|`|TmpTz2nKaa	ok this may be hard to accept but their is no returning air,think of a fan pointed at a wall when the air hits the wall it does not return to the fan, theirfore we must also take into account is newtons second law F=ma when the force of the air beening pushed out under the hovercraft is great enough to overcome the force of gravity it will generated lift...the air once hitting the ground will not return back up it will disperse <br>  <br>  simply put <br>  air goes down...the action<br>  Hovercraft goes up...the reaction|`|mFg3GWi0aa	the equal and opposite reactions are hovercraft pushes air and air pushes hovercraft.  The action-reaction pair has to be part of the same system.  If you include the floor, now you have three things in your system - air, floor, hovercraft.  <br>  <br>  It's just like a rocket.  Rocket pushes gases out, gases push on rocket.|`|JuxPqlhfaa	No if that was it u cant move the crafter coz the air pushed down is left behind. It works the exact way the helecopte dose but dosent get that high. The fans are pushing the wind down and this causes a force on the hoover craft|`|62eddc29f8f85c212ab037f471d47319aa	I could copy the text, but just click the link below...<br>   <br>  ps.<br>  I found it by googling "Hovercrafts: how does Newton's 3rd law"<br>  it took (0.21 seconds) |`|obFG9EXGaa	gravity is pulling down and the hovercraft must push with a stronger force in order to get off the ground|`|K87vKkA8aa	It doesn't, lol hence the HOVER part of hovercraft
