20090306220507AAnz0Pb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	My mom got mad at me for "over reacting"?	So my teacher assigned a project 3 weeks ago. I asked some people in the class and they all said that they were scared a day before their presentation. But I had this sick feeling in my stomach for the WHOLE 3 weeks. I felt anxious and stressed. So I called my mom to tell her about it. She lives somewhere else. And whenever I call her shes always busy at work or sleeping. She was getting mad and she was like "Why are you even scared! You shouldn't even feel that way! Your just acting it." I don't even know why she freaked out. "If you really want to, then go tell your father to bring you to a physciatrist" she said it like I was being stupid and making a big deal out of it. This was last night. But today at school I got that feeling in my stomach again. I don't know where it came from, it just popped out of nowhere and I didn't have to do a presentation or anything! (I felt extremely better after my presentation.) I really wanted to know if this was something to even be worried about so I called her because shes a nurse. I see my mom twice a month and my dad is always at work and when he has a day off he does his part time job. So my parents love me but they're neglecting me. I was kind of thinking this would give me more attention. I know its stupid. But that's not why I was worried in the first place.

20090307001028AAm1T6Y	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Hello ttc ladies.....feeling more positive now?	My husband and i have been ttc for 3 years now, we already have a beautiful daughter but as you can imagine it's not been good for us the past couple of years.      We have had basic tests to check our fertility which showed no problems however i am being sent for a scan to check my uterus soon.   Im a little nervous but because the thought of actually getting pregnant seems impossible, im more hopeful now as the scan may reveal a problem that can be solved.      My question is what can i expect them to check for on ultrasound?      also whats the chances of PCOS when i have very regular periods and no other symptoms?      thanks x

Of course naturally most say that they take it because of missed period + symptoms or just missed period. But, what made YOU take one if you weren't trying to have a baby? Just curious.      My last period was 2/1/09 and I'm about 4-6 days late. Taking a test soon. :-) I don't really have any symptoms besides missed period. I just got over a random yeast infection too. Which the doctor said that wouldn't make me late. =D      Have ANY of you found out you were pregnant and had ZERO symptoms? Was it shocking & exciting for you? =D

20090307003509AAPrHok	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Sorry...i guess i didnt make myself too clear...?	Ok i had my period january 27-31 which is a normal period for me. i had sex on february 12. The online pregnancy test said that this day would be a 20% chance of being pregnant. and i still haven't had my period. so i took a test wednesday morning and it came up positive... the second line was very faint tho so i just decided to go to the doctor just to be sure. so i went to the doctor to get a urine test and it said it was negative. the doctor told me it was just as effective as the blood test..(i don't think this is true considering i would only be about 3 weeks) but after she told me it was negative she said to take a first response test in the next morning so i did and it came up negative. i am just wondering if there's something i should do or does it mean im not pregnant?       If you answered my other question i am sorry you don't have to answer this one too. i just needed to make myself more clear.

20090306235259AAXmS2n	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What can I do to children going badly out of line?	I know it is a long paragraph but please read it because I really need help.      I am having a real problem with 2 of my children because they are getting off the track.  One is 12 and other is 15 years old and they both think they are all time gangsters.  They go out and steal stuff from shops.  They don't stay at home and they get out of the home using their room window if I try to stop them.  Once I locked them out and they nearly broke my door.  I called the police but I didn't press any charges.  I thought everything will be fine but after that they were on their peak.  They were proud to face the police and they were telling each other "see bro we are the real gangsters".  They don't show me any school report and they don't go to school no more.  They skip school and roam in stores all day long and keep stealing stuff from the stores.  They were once arrested for shoplifting and I had em out of there and when I came back and tried to discipline them they attacked me and if my wife and other two children were not there they would have chocked me to death.  My oldest son called the police and they were arrested once again.  They stayed in there for a night and I had em out next day because of their school.  Then in mail we received a letter giving us the date of hearing and I thought they won't go out any more but no they didn't stop.  When I talked to them politely and asked them politely what they need and why are they doing all the stuff at home both of em gave me big lists of demands, they were asking for Personal TV, Laptop, ipod, iphone, Xbox, PS3, madden's latest version, new bicycle, a kid heavy bike, a new basketball goal, a driver's license and a sports car (the 15 year old one) and the lists go on and on.  I have their bedroom's door out and they have no door to lock but now I have the new problem.  I heard them planning to take my credit card and my social security number out of my room and go buy new i phone and stuff with it and one night when they came back home at 11pm I told them to stay outside and when I was standing right at the door they started talking to each other and they were talking to each other about breaking into someone's house and live a night there and then take all the stuff out and come back.  My wife and other 2 children are doing their best to help me but they are just as helpless as me .  Please give me any ideas about what to do and how to improve my home's conditions.      Thank You.
20090307001741AAI1NLH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	HELP!! I need info regarding the adoption of a baby boy born on January 8, 1971...?	...his birth Mom was about 24 yrs old, single, lived in New Jersey for a period of time, and was a Nurse. The baby boy was born in New Jersey on January 8, 1971 and I know that "Monmouth" is a key piece of information. I also know that the adoption was handled through an attorney. I heard that he lived in New York (I think immediately after the adoption) with his new family. HOW DO I FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THIS ADOPTED BABY BOY?
20090307015357AAKGwL2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	What are your experiences on adoption?	I have a friend who I found out was adopted. For her, it's a very personal matter and a few times have shed tears about being adopted. She loves her adoptive parents and her younger sister (her adoptive parents' biological daughter). However several times, she has wondered whether her traits were that of her birth mother/natural father or not. And what they were like etc..       So my question is for those who are adopted, do you ever wonder whether any of your traits reflected your birth parents and how is your view on adoption/how your life was like?      And for birth parents how have your life turned out after adopting out your child? Emotionally/Physically/Mentally...etc      And for people who knew someone who was adopted/adopted a child out? Has it affected you at all? And more so, for those who found out your spouse had adopted a child out/was adopted. How did you feel when you first found out?       Thanks =]
20090307012824AAx8Z1x	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Does this make you uneasy?	When i read answers and questions referring to adoption as an 'industry' it makes me feel a bit queasy. I don't look at adoption as being an industry. It more to me as something that's not always needed in every case of a mother who can't parent, its just another option for her. Something that no money should every be made out of. No one should profit from adoption, not PAP's agencies, or even a woman thinking of relinquishing her right to parent her child. No money exchanges hands even in the form of 'gifts'.       To explain further, just in case to me industry = Profits, goods and services, products. Stock markets and share holders. no emotional attachments.( How can a person not be emotionally attached to a child in some way.)      That's what automatically comes into my mind when someone says 'Industry', and they put adoption into it and the two don't go together. do I have it wrong, or is my way of thinking about it all wrong.

20090307020734AAnYyfK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What should I do? Sooo worried!?	I just found out I'm pregnant a few days ago using a home pregnancy test. Only my boyfriend and I know.    We are both 17 and in year 12.   He fully supports me with whatever I decide to do, keep it, adoption etc.   I'm really freaked out and don't know what I should do.   I am at the most, 5 weeks pregnant and I plan to tell my parents with my boyfriend in the next couple of days.   I'm soooo stressed out about the whole idea of being pregnant and not sure how my future is looking from here.   I just need some reassuring words from mothers or even teen mothers who went through the same experiences.   Please don't give me a lecture about being too young because I am fully aware that I have made a huge mistake that can't be taken back and my boyfriend and I are prepared to deal with the consequences.      We have talked about the options...      1. We will keep the baby. I will be due around the start of November, so we will have completed year 12 and I will be able to look for a full time job after the baby is born. My boyfriend and I have part-time jobs and we can save until then. I have a Certificate III in Childrens Services and would easily be able to get a job at a child care centre. My boyfriend is also able to work in his dads restaurant until he finds another job.      2. Give the baby up for adoption. I can go to school throughout the pregnancy and finish year 12 and find a family who will adopt the baby.      3. Abortion. This is an option, but one I would hate to do. My boyfriend and I have created this baby and I am not going to kill it, just to make my life easier.      We are leaning towards keeping the baby, but once we talk to our parents and weigh up the options things may change.   Your opinions would be great because I am so nervous and worried about it all.      Thankyou

I don't know anyone with this name so I don't know. I was thinking about using the spelling Aaden instead of Aiden because Aaden doesn't have the "Aid" part in it. Aaden or maybe Aden? What do you think? Honest answers please. Thanks (:      BTW people are so ignorant. Aiden doesn't even need a nickname. It's not a long name.

My little boy has just turned 3 months and for the last week and a half he seems to have gone right off his milk. He had a chest infection so we thought it must be related to that, but hes better now and still isn't feeding as well as he used to. He was previously on about 6 oz every 3 / 4 hours, but now he's only taking a maximum of 4 oz and just doesn't seem interested - nearly everytime he feeds he's falling alseep. He still likes to have playtime and doesn't have any signs of dehydration, although his sleep is very disturbed (Im about to post a seperate question relating to that!). Im just concerned that he's gone from around 30 - 35oz a day to a maximum of about 25 oz. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? Id love to know your thoughts!

She is making out with her boyfriend every day after school and when ever they are not in a class. Now she's having sex. Why are twelve year olds doing this? She knows that if her father found out she was doing this, that I would kill her (he seriously would, trust me) im almost 15, and I havent even HAD my FIRST kiss yet!! Oh, an another girl my sister is friends with also had sex. She even missed her period for a few months, and thought she was pregnant.      So, two questions:      1.Why are twelve year olds doing this?   2.Am I a freak for only having dated one boy (when I was 10) and not having my first kiss yet??

20090306173302AA8ZFG5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How would you feel if you were me?	Okay, so me and my boyfriend broke up today. He told my friend to tell me. As soon as she walked into class she came towards me and said; "________[my name], I have some bad news to tell you. _________[my boyfriend, now ex's name] said he doesn't want to go out with you anymore because he stopped liking you."      It's kinda weird that 3 days before this happened, he kissed me. And yesterday, some girl was flirting with him at p.e., it makes me wonder..but whatever.      Then, his friend, also my friend, came up to me in class, and my friend was like "I already told her, you don't have to." Then his friend went up to my friend and whisphered something to her, and all I heard was "The only reason he wanted to go out with her was because..." and I couldn't hear the rest. Then my friend replied "Damn, that's cold.." [cold, meaning something that wasn't right or wasn't expected]. I told his friend to tell me, but he laughed and said no. I think I know what he said though..      I feel soooooo hurt, but then again, he's not worth it to be hurt from, after-all, I had a feeling that's what he wanted from me, but I wasn't paying a lot of attention on that because he seemed like a nice guy [I thought that's what he wanted from me because he would ask me when we'd have sex, and I got mad and told him to stop asking me that and notime soon]. Even though I thought I was in love with him, he ended up hurting me so very much, but I'm so proud of myself for saying "NO", because if I wouldn't have, I would have to live with the fact that I got pressured into losing my virginity. YAY ME!! Anyways, I don't think I can ever look him in the eyes again, ever.      How would you feel if you were me?      BTW, I know some of you guys may say this is the wrong section, but I just wanted to hear from those in their teens. But anyone can feel free to answer. Sorry it's so long.

20090306173118AAge5XE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Almost been arrested for punching, a BULLY!?	Okay well this grade 12 named Shawn who is 17 has been picking on me since day 1 of high school, I'm in grade 9 and 14, calling me Dirty Sanchez and slapping me whenever he sees me. Well my friend and I were walking to Macs convenience store and he was following us, and he called me Dirty Sanchez and grabbed me so I punched him right in the face! And an undercover cop almost arrested me! But I asked if I could file a report of harassment because he bullies me constantly and the cop let us go.   I don't want you all thinking I'm a bad kid. I take Academic courses and get A's. I guess him just bullying me got to me. That's why he was all sucking up to the police officer to let me go, because he knows damn well I would counter-sue for harassment if he charged me with assault, and win! I have 2-3 witness's who could defend me in court since they see him bully me, and all my teachers would say how I'm an active student and I'm easy-going, etc. I guess I should of gone to a vice principal, teacher, or my parents, but I was afraid he would just make fun of me anymore. I made a bad choice, but it's over now, and I learned my lesson, if I'm going to defend myself, do it in school and get suspended, instead of getting arrested almost!      So, my question finally, did I do the right thing? I think I did, I think he also learned a lesson on being a bully. Maybe he'll stop for the rest of the year until he graduates, because maybe he learned that not every victim is afraid to fight back.

20090306235010AA3hT70	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How do i get my 6th month old to sleep?	every nite its a constant battle.   I bathe my son around 8pm then his dad plays with him until i get outta my shower, about ten pm. he eats, and usually falls asleep during that bottle. if any1 trys to move him he wakes up screaming. i cannot take hearing him scream, it breaks my heart. starting from ten pm on, this is the cycle.       He will get rocked to sleep then he will wake up as soon as i put him down, however gently i do it. even if i wait over 30 min from the time he falls asleep he still snaps his little eyes open and starts crying.      this goes on until 5 am or later most nites then he wants to sleep until 3pm, which i do not allow. still though no sleep at night. he is on a schedule and takes short naps that i control. i wake him up from them early enough before he stops sleeping on his own.      i have tryed letting him CIO but he turns beet red, kicks and eventually vomits after only 10 minutes.       what can i do for my son? he only wants ME, not my fiance or his gma or anything. and he wants me to rock him and walk around carrying him.      it never used to be this way. he used to lay down awake and go to sleep himself.   is it teething?

20090306163736AAhrFhd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What can I do to convince my mom to let me be home-schooled?	I've been to public and private school all my life. My high school is public right now and it's sort of a good school. I won't be home schooled all day long. Here in Florida we have this online virtual school where we can take classes. I'll probably do some classes on there this summer so I can get ahead. I'm a really bright kid so it's not like I'll slack off at home. I'll probably do better. I always feel sick at school and I honestly don't learn ANYTHING. I can show you what I do at school everyday, I doodle all the time. I pass my classes with A's and I don't do anything. But my problem is I want to take two classes online and then two at school. My dad is okay with it but my mom isn't. She says if every other kid can go to school, why can't I? I thought of it too and there are more pros than cons. I already know how to interact with people since I've been to school all my life. I won't have to wake up at 6 in the morning which i think takes a toll physically on me. I'll actually be able to learn more. I have some friends that take extra classes on this thing and they enjoy it, they say it's fun, not too hard but you still learn stuff more than you do in class. I really want to do this but how can I get my mom over to see it on my side? I need to know how before school out for the summer so I can talk to my guidance counselor about choosing classes. Help? Thank you.

Now, well, I was raped, and now I am pregnant. I went to the Doctor and everything. When I told my parents, they said,"We will help you get rid of this thing. Though it is your fault." meaning they wanted me to get an abortion. I was all for it at first. I have plans in life that don't include a baby. But then i missed all the appointments my parents set up. I want this baby. I talked to my older sister, she is in Med school and her husband is a dr. she said she will help me in every way possible. I approached my parents about keeping the baby. They said." No way in hell!" My little sister was listening and said, "I won't have a crying snot nosed rape conceived baby in my house!" My older sister said I could live with her and keep the baby do online schooling and get a job. btw i am 16. she is 22. her husband is 25.      But should I press charges against the rape? i have a rape kit and know who has done it (my bff's bf) thank you so much!

20090307043144AAQcK0G	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Is my Kid a bully or is my friend bulling my kid?	I have a nearly three year old.   Shes quite a character and has a big personality.   But my best friend seems to think that she is picking on her four yr old boy, and gets really angry about it.   I think shes making a big deal over nothing as 99 percent of the time they play with no problems, but every now and then they have a tiff (like normal kids do) its not all ways my daughters fault but sometimes i fell she get the blame.   i.e If shes playing with something and he takes it from her my daughter will shout at him and my friend seems to think she should be told off for this, but if she take something from him he'll come and tell and again my friend feels she should get punished, so either way its all ways her fault. But i like the fact that she can stand up for her self and the fact that shes outgoing.   I relay like my friend and enjoy being around her, but  feels the kids age gap and my daughter inability to explain wen shes been miss treated by my friend son may pull use apart.   She has no problem playing with any of her other friend and plays the same with them as she does with my friend son, i no this because i asked then after finding out my friend felt this way.   Oh and another thing the other day my daughter had a bite mark on her hand and was crying that my friends son had done it to her, wen i told my friend she told me that the teeth marks were not her sons and my daughter must have done if too herself....hmmmm

20090306233656AAeqLhi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My baby's mother might be pregnant again and this time she hates me?	Me and my baby's mother have been together for about two years now, and with in that time frame she got pregnant. While pregnant I lost my job sometime in her second trimester around the fourth to fifth month. During that time she was become distant and wanted nothing to do with me. I personally think it was her hormones and the fact that I had no job and she was just afraid of the financial aspect of the situation. Then the baby was born everything was cool again we got back together and now the baby is 7 months. Just about 2 to 3 months ago we started having sex again, she told me that she had not gotten her period for the whole month of February and she's acting like she was before distant and rejecting me again. This has been going on for about two week straight, I mean we still talk and joke, but she is not affectionate towards me anymore shes very cut and dry. Unfortunately I have not yet landed another job yet but I have been on many interviews and I am diligently looking. If she is pregnant again could this be why she acting to short and shallow with me again. Also, could all of this stress force her to look for another mate.

20090307044411AASeM2W	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	If I can't function on this much sleep, how can my baby?!?!?	My 7 month old has went from sleeping 10 hours a night (waking 1-2 times a night) and taking 3-5 hours worth of naps to 8 hours a night (waking 5-7 times a night) and taking 1-2 hours worth of naps. Most nights, she will give me one span of 3 hours but the rest of the night she wakes every half hour or hour.      I breastfeed her and she is not interested in anyone else getting up with her.  I'm not a SAHM, but right now I'm off work for at least two weeks.  But I have been working full time up until yesterday, so my sleep deprivation has caught up with me.      Her sleeping pattern change really seemed to coincide with starting her on solids at 6 months.  I started out doing BLW, but I recently started introducing a spoon because she was super interested in utensils and not interested in feeding herself with her hand.  So I have been fork-mushing things like sweet potatoes, avacados, etc. and I will put it on the spoon for her.  She will pick the spoon up and put it in her mouth.  I know this isn't strict BLW, but it's working for us.      That old adage that babies sleep better with full tummies is crap in my book.  My MIL is telling me that my baby needs to be fed (somehow breast milk is akin to water to her).  She thoroughly objects to my decision to wait on grains until 9 months, wanting me to stuff her with rice cereal so she'll sleep.  (I don't listen to her advice, but I get to hear it all the time!)      Okay, I'm rambling because of the lack of sleep.  Anywho, I'm not going to do CIO.  She sleeps in her crib most of the night, but I will bring her into my bed to nurse so that I can get a little more sleep.  She still wakes as often in my bed as in her crib.  If she's in my bed, I sleep worse because I can't get comfortable with her in bed and I'm so afraid of waking her up.      I'm dying here.  If I don't get some real hours of consecutive sleep soon, I'm afraid of what I'm going to do.  I get so frustrated at night.  I haven't done anything to my baby or anything, but I have gone into the other room and shouted obscenities at the top of my lungs while she cried on several occasions.        Any help would be appreciated.
20090307032702AA3jB7r	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Which party was your favourite?	My kids are having their 10th birthday party tomorrow. It is at their gymnastics place. And it got me thinking of their different parties and which were favourites.    For me I think it was either    My daughters 7th birthday party was a purple party. Purple balloons, place mats, cups, plates etc. They made their own pizza's, iced cupcakes and biscuits and decorated them. Painted nails purple, sprayed hair purple. They played pin the tail on the donkey, had sack races and played Pass the parcel and musical chairs and Statues. The kids had a great time and I enjoyed it too.   For the other party was their 5th, they had just started kinder so I invited the whole class and we went to the park. Lot's of home made food and the kids had running races and water balloon fights. Very simple and parents told me for weeks how much fun their kids had and still talked about it.      It goes to show it does not have to be big and expensive to be a good party.

I will be nursing Aaron when Alex is having his meals and snacks, but sometimes AJ wants to be held out of nowhere. What should I do while I'm feeding Aaron?       2. If I'm cleaning or showering, Aaron will be strapped in the bouncy seat where I can see him. Alex can climb out his walker now though so where should Alex be? He has lots of toys, a crib, and a play pen but I'm not so sure.      3.Alex still likes to get in bed with hubby and I sometimes but I want to co-sleep with Aaron. What can be done about this?      Please no rude answers and you don't have to be so serious about all of this. I'd just like some ideas whether you're in this situation or not. I'd like to know what other mommies would do. I plan on having story time for both kids at the same time and having my husband help out with bath time since he'll be home. I'm just so overwhelmed that I'm going to have two babies 13 months apart and it's becoming more nad more apparant to me as the time gets closer lol. Thanks everyone so much for any help and/or advice!! Any other suggestions for anything else would be great. Sry for the length of my question.      -Mommy to a 12 month old and 37w4d pregnant with #2
20090307045550AA9soTw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Are you a parent who doesn't care/help your kids our with fashion?	are you a parent who doesn't care/help/think its important enough/support finacially with fashion ???????????      My daughters friends were over yesterday and I heard them talking. My daughter often comes to me and tells me what kind of things are in fashion...of course i can't get her everything...and wouldn't want to spoil her..but when we go shopping..i let her pick out 1 "must have item"....Seems to work.      I over heard some of her friends saying how their parents says fashion isn't important .....and generally the moms don't have any interest in appearance/clothes etc...I have never really thought tooo much about it..but it just hit me how sad this one girl seemed.    She said " as if highschool isn't hard enough without Mom making me shop at walmart and jc penny".       I dunno....not that i want my daughter to me spoilt / shallow etc...but i think Mom's should help kids out in this way...      what you think ???????????????????????

I started spotting on CD24 but didnt have a full flow till CD25. (so thats CD1 really)       Anyways my period is having alot of clots...

This does happen every period.. but just wondering if its normal?

20090307043555AAxrZGx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Would you give up your child to a foster home because there's no help to help?	Child care is expensive, and if your child has needs to have a one on one, and you can't afford to pay that as a single parent. What does one do? Especially when it's effecting your job, because no day care with other children would have him. HE HAS TO MUCH ENERGY, transition problems, post dramatic stress, at time anger.      He has been to a doctor, he has a therapist, and he is doing better in school this year, but the problem is daycare. If I find the right person to help him one on one, I don't think I can afford it. And so far every agency has turn down help.       It's hard to manage everything while working all day, I have to seek help on the phone at work using a calling card. I am always on the border line to do with my yearly amount, and my son is on the border line of ADHD      I can pray for help, perhaps the spirits will come back to comfort me. But the sad thing is these spirit usually help more than all these people working making good money to help others....and seemingly cannot help some who are stuck in some way. I am afraid I will lose my job if I can find and afford to pay for a one on one.

Last weekend he had trouble with some golf-ball-like stools, and we gave him prunes for breakfast for 2 mornings in a row.  The third day I gave him a 6 oz bottle of 100% prune juice.  On Wednesday he was straining and I thought he was pooping, but there was nothing in his diaper.      Here it is, Friday.  He hasn't had a BM since Monday, and even then it was just a few little rock hard pebbles.  He was straining Wedensday, but other than that he doesn't seem to be uncomfortable.      I called the doctor this morning at 9am and I haven't gotten a call back.  My husband called at lunch and left another message.  He just called 10 minues ago and left yet another message.  So we've explored that route. :)      Any advice, other than prunes (which are clearly not working)?  Since he's not even in any discomfort, is this something we even need to be worrying about?

I am a 20 year old female and mother of a 14 month old little boy (unplanned but happy to have him!). Anyways I have been trying to conceive for 3 months but my cycles have been irregular(no surprise since they have been since I started my period at 13 and a half). My doctor said I may have anuovulatory cycles since I had a period in december none in january and one in February. My question is can I still ovulate when I'm not having a period? Also, he said since I have hypothyroidism it may be harder to conceive (I'm taking levothyroxine for it). Is that true for others? Thanks!

My Partner and I will be starting to try for our first child at the end of the year, so I am getting myself prepared, eating healthy, exercise etc etc (I don't Smoke or drink so that helps)      Anyway we already know my partner has a slight problem, which can possibly be rectified with an operation but we want to "give it chance" before making that step, Basically the problem is with his foreskin which prevents the sperm being ejaculated high up into me and it rather just sits lower in the vagina, he has been given varying percents of chance to conceive from 0-5% but we want to give it a go before any operations just in case ... after all it only takes one strong swimmer to make it.      Can anyone give me any ideas apart from raising my pelvis really high after sex to help the sperm travel? what other things can I do to increase the chances of conceiving?      Sorry for too much info ... also we are going to try for a year and if no luck he will go and get the operation (that is joint decision)      thanks

My daughter is 17 months and seems to be learning something new every day, lol!  She absolutely loves books and we read one or two together every night before bedtime.  Recently when we have been reading she has been getting quite upset at the point in the book when the baby or teddy (or whatever the main character happens to be) goes to bed and closes his eyes.  She doesn't scream or yell, but she goes all quiet, points to the picture of the baby asleep and her bottom lip starts to tremble and she cries very quietly.  I have absolutely no idea what this is about!  She is not scared of going to bed herself - she just gets all snuggled up and goes to sleep on her own.  She has seen me and her daddy asleep a few times and not had a problem with it so what is going on?  I have stared to skip the parts in the books when they go to bed but she knows something is different and turns the pages till she gets to it, then gets upset again!  I would change to different books but she is very attached to these ones (her favourites are "can't you sleep little bear?" and "good night teddy").  Any ideas as to what is going on and how I can help?  Thanks!

20090307040900AApbCwa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Trying to get pregnant?	Okay I'm officially two weeks late on my period or even more. Last period started on Jan 26th; had unprotected sex on Feb. 14th, 16th, and 22nd. My period is irregular, and I know that it will be a bit difficult for me to have a baby since i'm irregular. After taking so many hpts and being disappointed that I'm not pregnant. Can I try to have a baby this month, or do I have to wait until my next period start before I can conceive?      I think that the reason why I didn't get my period this month was probably the stress from work and school that i'm getting.      I hope my period will show up soon, I want a baby so much now.      My husband is okay with the idea of having a baby, so I'm planning to go to the clinic on Monday so I can do the blood test and find out why I'm having a missed period.      I feel like a failure. My husband and I have been married for one year and 11 months. In the past he did precome inside me and I never get pregnant. So we try to get pregnant by having unprotected sex, and I don't feel pregnant at all. I don't have any dreams that relate to a baby.      I hope I am pregnant...

This is when i have ewcm, but it's also accompanied with lotion-like cm. (sorry tmi i know)...and by day 17, i'm pretty much desert dry.      Well...? Do you think I'm predicting this right?

Any who, they briefly talked about how men get circumcised or have their foreskin replaced when they become adults. I don't care about you views on circumcision, I'm just curious; How would you feel if your son chose to get circumcised or have foreskin replaced when he became an adult? Would you feel like you made a mistake in your choice when he was a baby?

20090227131847AAXSAXY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Do i call or wait till next apt?	i am currently 35 weeks 5 days i was just at the doctors for my last 2 week check up feb 20 and since then in the past week have been experiencing head aches; not the usual "ow my head hurts" they are full blown pass me the bottle of Tylenol ( since i have been pregnant i can count the number of times ive taken Tylenol on one hand and i have taken it twice now with these head aches) they start in my forehead and my eyes feel like they are throbbing. I do wear contacts so i have considered the idea it could be related from them however as soon as the slightest sign of a head comes i take them out and put my glasses on.       I have also been experiencing swelling i understand thats a normal symptom for pregnancy however it gets to the point where my face gets so big i don't really look myself (i look like i gained weight in my face but after a few hours or the next day it goes away) and my hands get so swollen that i cant make a nice fist with out it hurting. I also get a similar problem with my feet they get swollen; when i wear socks and take them off you can see where my socks ended on my ankle my foot will be swollen where the sock were but that swelling is not nearly as bad as the rest of my calves where the sock was not at.       Through out my pregnancy i have complained about feeling faint being dizzy and my doctor tells me to just relax make sure i get my protein and water and should fine. (with this advice i have been fine)      i had a false alarm at 32 weeks (thought my water broke) the nurse told my doctor i had protein in my urine and asked if she was concerned my doctor replied "no her blood pressure was not concerning"      I typically have low blood pressure i have for the past year i just recently read about preeclampsia i know it mainly has to do with your blood pressure but i havent been to the doctors in a week and have until next fri to see them again am i just being paranoid that preeclampsia? or could this be a possibility for me with the given symptoms.  Thanks!
20090307045219AA0iAaY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I really need advice and help!?	First of all, This is my younger SISTERS account!!! I am just borrowing it for this question.       Now, well, I was raped, and now I am pregnant. I went to the Doctor and everything. When I told my parents, they said,"We will help you get rid of this thing. Though it is your fault." meaning they wanted me to get an abortion. I was all for it at first. I have plans in life that don't include a baby. But then i missed all the appointments my parents set up. I want this baby. I talked to my older sister, she is in Med school and her husband is a dr. she said she will help me in every way possible. I approached my parents about keeping the baby. They said." No way in hell!" My little sister was listening and said, "I won't have a crying snot nosed rape conceived baby in my house!" My older sister said I could live with her and keep the baby do online schooling and get a job. btw i am 16. she is 22. her husband is 25.      But should I press charges against the rape? i have a rape kit and know who has done it (my bff's bf) thank you so much!

I was reading some health related blogs and news. They say that study shows baby born during fall has more chances to expose to asthma. So what could be done while pregnancy to avoid such situations?

I do take prenatal vitamins regularly. Is that enough?

20090227132603AAJBwNp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Make any sense of this?	I know I know... no one can tell me i'm pregnant but a doc or a pregnancy test. I know this.      But here I am 6DPO. So no test will show that anyways. And I want LOGICAL opinions... not told to take a test. Lets face it I already know that and it isn't helpful. I just want logic.      So I had a miscarriage this month. I got told my by doc when I was ovulating and that I could try again this same month. So I know I o'ed on the 21st. Me and hubby had bd 3 times! Yea lots of baby dancing...   With that said I feel like I'm having symptoms.. The same ones I had when I was pregnant. BUT Much faster than last time. I mean I thought symptoms should show up no sooner than 6DPO and that is where I am and I had symptoms last night!      Anyways, I'm HUNGRY! So hungry. I have to keep eating or I get excruciating stomach cramps and hunger pangs. Nothing I could really make happen mentally. I eat and they go away. Well this was the case when I was pregnant. I usually NEVER get hunger pangs cause I have a stomach condition.       Well I mentally feel like I'm out of it this month but physically I'm starting to wonder if I'm just being a skeptic. I mean there is no other logical reason why I'd feel like this!

20090307044717AAlfRuH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	HELP - 1st Trimester Pregnancy?	For squeamish men....skip this up.  Women PLEASE HELP ME!!      This is my second pregnancy, I am in my 6th or 7th week.  With my first pregnancy I didn't really bond or register that I was having a baby until 8 months but I was under a great deal of stress and in a domestic violence situation so it was kind of unreal.  With this baby i'm in a supportive and lovign relationship so I bonded with this child the second I saw the gestational sac on an ultrasound.  Please know i'm only talking about pregnancy bonding, my current son is the light of my life, i love him more then anything.  Here is my question....Wednesday I went to the bathroom and passed a large clot but had minimal cramping, after that there was no bleeding, just faint spotting.  I went to the ER, they did an ultrasound and saw a gestational sac (this was my second ultrasound seeing a sac) but they say no fetal pole, heartbeat or yolk sac.  They did a HCG screening and told me to go to my OB in 3 days to get a new screening.  They said if my hormones double or go up significantly then the pregnancy is still viable, if it doesn't the pregnancy has failed.  they called it a threatened miscarriage.  Of course my heart was broken i was and am a mess, so I went home and for the entire day thursday I had no spotting.  Friday the spotting came back but no clots and it was very light.  I went back to the OB and they did a blood test and sent me home and told me not to worry (thanks) they told me to come back on Wednesday but to stay on bed rest until then.  So now it's Saturday at 4am and I woke up with bright red blood and no clots...I don't know waht's going on please help!! If i'm loosing the baby I need to register and accept that, if this is something that is just happening I need to put my mind at ease.  This is heartbreaking and so confusing.  Has this happened to anyone and do you know what's going on?  My first pregnancy wtih my son I had cramps but it was because I was pregnant for the first time and my uterus was stretching, I never spotted a day of that pregnancy.  PLEASE HELP...I'm officially panicking.

For the past 3 months (not that that's necessarily how for along I'd be) I have had 2-3 day extremely light periods...which is completely bizarre because from the day I started mine have been no shorter than 5 days and super long! In the past 2 weeks I have experienced extreme fatigue, nausea,headaches, that bizarre metallic taste in my mouth- although I know this could be many things I was just wondering if it's possible I'm pregnant. I know some women have a period like bleeding in the beginning...I took a urine test about a month and a half ago that was negative and I'm obviously sexually active only using the pull out method- no other BC.

20090307024042AAakFiA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Still feel pregnant, but was told I miscarried. I don't believe the doctor..?	For the past few weeks I've known I'm pregnant. Based on my last cycle I should about 5 weeks along.  I've got all the symptoms, including my linea nigra showing up within the first 5 weeks (I've been pregnant before) and a light period that came 4 days early, no clots and minimal cramping. All my hpt's, ultrasound and blood test were negative, so doctor has said I miscarried. Doctor said it was because I had bleeding. I don't believe her because I didn't have any clots and 2 weeks later my symptoms are still strong as ever. I've decided to wait until 15days after the bleeding stopped and then I'll test again, as with my first child I tested a week to soon and got all negative results, but then on the 15th day from a day of spotting, it showed up positive. My questions are that how can a doctor tell me I've miscarried if all my tests were negative? As well, could I have ovulated late which results in my dates being off?

When I use the restroom and wipe, there is a very small amount of blood. It is not coming from inside of me, it's from my labia.       Until I got pregnant, I shaved on a regular basis. Now that the hair is growing back, could that be causing the skin to be even more sensitive than pregnancy is making it? I'm in the restroom quite frequently and I realize that it could be irritated from having to wipe so often.         This happened once before and I struggled to shave and once I had, it cleared up pretty quickly and I didn't have another problem until hair started to grow back again.

20090307060844AAv8aUy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	He yelled at me because I dont breastfeed my baby?	My daughter is 3 1/2 weeks old. I was set on breastfeeding her but she doesnt latch on since my nipples are flat and I just never got around to the breast-pump, plus I have WIC and get the formulas for free so being that I am still 21 year old full-time college student, its convenient.      My bf asked me to breastfeed her last week and I said I'd try but the latching on was still just so unsuccessful due to the flat nipples. Last night he slept over and this morning when I gave her a bottle of formula he yelled at me and said we're going to have problems, that if I want a healthy baby I should breastfeed, and to tell doctor at her next visit to say I dont breastfeed.      I held back the tears as i let him out the door and didn't say a word. He doest understand why im upset. I love my daughter. I feel like I'm doing a good job. I'm practically doing this alone during the week b/c he only comes over to see her one night during the weekend. I even take her to her appointments by myself. At the same time I'm a fulltime 3rd year engineering student at a university....the stress of being a fulltime student and mother is tremendous, but I'm pulling though b/c she is my main motivation. Hes attached to the baby (I can see the passion in his eyes when hes around her) but at the same time has not even willingly changed ONE diaper yet which makes it wrong in so many ways that he should get fussy about this issue when I'm practically doing everything myself.      I'm hurt for a lot of reasons. I now feel so guilty about formula-feeding but the flat nipples was just a big problem . Its too late anyway b/c my milk supply already ran out. He made me feel like crap and he made me feel like a bad mother even though I'm trying to do the best I can.      I dont even know why I'm crying, he was just being a jerk but maybe its due to the hormones that are still in my body and the stress. I guess I just needed to get this off my chest...any advice, thoughts, opinions would be nice. Thanks and have a good day.

20090307055338AAHRApk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you think it's ok for a 15 year old to fly alone?	My daughter is 15, has travelled with my husband and I pretty extensively, so she knows exactly what to do to go through security, etc.    She wants to travel from Ontario to BC - about a 5 hour direct flight to go see her grandparents this summer. We would take her to the airport and her grandparents would pick her up at the other end. I am very overprotective and don't want her to do this but I don't want to take an opportunity from her either and my husband thinks it's ok. I'm just extremely nervous about letting her fly on her own. I'm asking other parents if they would let their 15 year old fly alone under the above noted circumstances?

20090307054251AA2iPMi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Why are my friends' snobby?	so my friends and I known each other since high school. most of them are successful people (doctor, lawyer, nurse, research analyst, legal secretary, manager, etc). we meet each other for lunch every about once a week. they put me down alot because I clean people's houses for extra money or they make jokes about me and my job. they treat me as if I'm beneath them cuz they make more money than me. my job doesn't define who I am and I enjoy this because I get exercise too. i do this part time so I can stay home the rest of the time to take care of my kid and that way I don't spend a fortune on childcare. most of my friends have nannies/housekeepers or put their children in childcare full time cuz they work 60-80 hrs a week.      what do i say to my friends when they make unnecessary jokes about me and my job? i know you're gonna say to find a new set of friends but first I wanna know what to say to them and maybe they'll make an attitude adjustment.

20090307063214AA3PAUF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Is this normal or genious for a ten year old girl?	Now, remember this is a ten year old girl. She has a laptop and is on it twenty-four-seven. She has an email address, and loves to type on Microsoft Word. She can type very fast and without looking at the keyboard, and when she types in school and finishes quickly her teachers ask her to help others. But, the other kids ask her questions like "Where is the M?". She thinks she is too smart! She also really likes playing school, dancing, and cheerleading. When she plays school, she really plays school! She prints & types IEPs, 504 Plans, letters to student's parents, and even types like class lists to use every time she plays. She dances three times a week, but also enjoys playing dancing. She even types programs for her fake dance recital! Oh, and cheerleading, yes, she cheers and plays cheerleading. When she plays, she types team rosters and that kind of stuff. Lastly, she is obsessed with names & big families. She bought the two adult books "Multiple Blessings" from Jon & Kate Plus 8 and "20 & Counting!" from the Duggar Family (18 Kids & Counting). She also bought a baby name dictionary. She has a fake family with fifteen kids and knows there first & middle names by heart. One of her friends, also has a fake family with fourteen kids. So, is this normal, weird, super smart, or what for a ten year old girl?

20090307053948AAZiL6X	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Ideas to get my baby to take her medicine?	My 7 month old daughter has an ear infection.  She refuses to take her amoxicillion.  She will clamp her jaws shut and I have to shove the syringe in her mouth.  If I depress it to put it all in her mouth at once she will spit it all out, if I do a little at a time and make her keep her mouth shut she will swallow a little and still spit the rest out.  She doesn't like it in her bottle, with milk or juice.  I've tried pushing it back in her cheek, and that doesn't work.  It doesn't taste bad, she just hates medication. The bottle was supposed to laste for 10 days, but we've had it for less than 24 hours and I'm already 1/2 through it, because she keeps spitting it out.  I never had this problem with my 2 year old, he would gladly take any medication.  Any ideas? Thank you!

20090307054507AAdDzJ4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	7-month-old refusing savory food?	My daughter was doing fine with a mix of meat with veggies as well as pureed fruit up until about a month ago, when she got quite bad diarrhea (lasted 8 days, she refused to eat or drink and became quite quickly dehydrated, so we had to force fluids and get whatever we could into her).  Since then, she's been really fickle about food, and is now refusing to eat anything that isn't sweet (ie, fruit puree).  I've tried mixing savory (like cottage pie) with something sweet, loading the spoon with separate dips of savory and sweet, not offering the option of fruit or yogurt (she'll sit and cry and refuse anything after a while), making it myself (I made chicken with apricots and sweet potatoes- she hated it).  I don't know what to do.  I've tried taking her back to just cereal and milk, but now she won't even take that.  I know she needs to start having a bit more protein, and I've tried lentils as well, which are also a no-go.  Oh, by the way, for anyone concerned- she's getting at least 24oz of formula a day (often more), so she's nutritionally covered.  Any advice would be very welcome.  Thanks!

20090307072250AAK1Q6s	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How do i convince my mom that I am a good person? and how do I balance school and soccer?	I was just asking about being allowed to see slumdog millionare, and my mom said that I am not mature enough to see it because I can't balance my school and social life.(like that has anything to do with seeing a frikin movie) I am really into soccer, and my mom says I should be able to balance soccer with taking higher level classes at my school, but that I'm not mature enough. I want to stay in the higher level courses because my friends are there, and I don't want change, but soccer is my entire life, and I want to be able to continue to pursue my dream to become pro one day.The truth is, i do have trouble balancing. I feel like because we have multitudes of projects at one time, I never have time to get in shape, or try to improve my soccer skills. How can I balance school and soccer?      Also... My mom says that I think of her as the enemy, and completely overeacts about EVERYTHING i do. Since we've had an arguement, for the next few weeks she won't be able to let it go, and she will bring up our fight in everything. How do I convince my mom that I'm not a bad person and that i can balance my life?

20090307062110AAZDtQl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Shared parenting arrangements in Australia.?	Please excuse the long question but there is much to share.       My ex and I have 1 child together now 5, we broke up when he was 2 (un-married). Immediately after the break up (upon me returning home) I found our belongings removed from our house and our child 'else where' during the next two weeks I received messages and phone calls saying "your child misses you, come and see US" which I did not comply to as he wanted to see me 1st. After these agonizing 2 weeks and under advice from my lawyer I convinced him to allow me to spend some time with our son after which I didn't return him. During the next few months we went to mediation and came up with a workable (not likable) arrangement in which I complied to but after a few months he did not, as he became 'too busy' late or tomorrow etc. A few more months passed before he wanted to see our son again and again we went to mediation to find a arrangement which was workable but not likable, and again we both comply for a few months before he moved interstate (without our child). After he returned (a few more months) we without mediation came into our own arrangement which was almost the same as the old ones (these are only verbal and our 'old' ones are still legally in place) during this arrangement again he sees our son for a month or so before he is late or to busy today "maybe tomorrow" or "unable" to call. Since this he hasn't seen our son for 4 months although in the last 2 he has request quiet a few times, I have denied  (mostly with excuses) as I a tired of seeing our son ask "will he be here soon?" only to receive a call 30 minutes later and hear him cry. What do I do now our child is finally happy without being 'let down' constantly and these excuses will not last forever I have been informing him of our sons life in the hope that he will find comfort in knowing our child is doing well and leave him alone. I don't want to see him be upset again and becoming 'naughty' (couldn't think of a more appropriate word, sorry). I don't think I could endure another legal processes, as it just seems never ending!       PS The father has never once payed child support, in fact I used to send our son with money as i was afraid the father wouldn't have money to feed him etc      Our son has a step father in his life that makes him happy      I do everything for our son, absolutely everything and this 'father' will see him once or twice a month and think his job is done!      I am angry and sad and so very tired of it all!      I know it's a little long but any feed back will be appreciated

My son will be turning 13 soon and we will be celebrating his bar mitzvah in the synagogue. He told me that he's worried he'll be nervous and have to pee. He doesn't want to have to leave in the middle of the service, or to feel uncomfortable during it. He wears underjams at night for his bedwetting problem. (The doctor says he should outgrow it soon.) My son wants to wear a goodnite to the service. He says he'll feel more comfortable. But it seems wrong for a kid his age to wear a diaper when he doesn't have to. Should I let him?
20090307060912AAbFh81	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Pregnancy Question! PLEASE?	Okay I know you can pregnant on the pill...pull out method ETC....   I however am not on the pill and use the pull out method.   My last LMP was Feb 14th 2009 and it lasted abut 5 days(normal as always) I have a 28 days cycle!!   I had unprotected sex 19th and 26th of February.   The day after the 26th (aka the 27th lol) I had horrible cramps all day..   And then I was fine after about 5:30 pm.   Saturday everything was normal! But come Sunday I woke up with my boobs SOOO sensitive. I couldn’t wear a shirt or a bra. That pain lasted until I fell asleep that evening.    On Monday I got for work and my boobs didn’t hurt as bad, just a TAD sensitive, yet my nipples we hard as rocks all day(I know TMI). I had slight cramps throughout the day..but nothing painful. When I got home from work I had diarrhea(sry tmi). And then my Bf and I had Sex again. About an hour after sex, taking a shower etc..i had to pee and in my thong was some brownish color. But nothing when I wiped. So I went to bed.   On Tuesday I realized that I was so exhausted around 12( even after getting 9 hrs of sleep), I never get that tired unless im up for 24 hours! Well after work I got home and went pee there was some more brownish in my thong(NOT a lot at all) but none when I wiped. I went to bed at 7 that night and didn’t wake until 6:30(I so could have slept longer.)   And Wednesday I had no spotting some watery discharge. And exhausted. And Thursday when I went tried to go to bed I realized my boobs kept getting in the way (I have 36D..but they seemed bigger) I cant really tell if they got darker. On my nipple theres patches of brown though. But as of today just slight cramping on my sides...keeps taking turns. I HAVE NEVER gotten any f these 2 weeks before my period let alone a few days before. Its usually during and after. Any idea???
20090307062434AAmWgN5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Have your children been affected by the disappearance of Madeleine McCann?	I ask because my brother said his daughters (6 and 8) have expressed fear when going to bed at night.       Apparently the father of a friend of the youngest, was attacked by a burglar and his daughter (and school friends) believe her father was trying to prevent the burglar from trying to abduct her.      As children many of us feared monsters under the bed, which was an unrealistic fear. But it seems the monsters have been replaced by real life abductors.      Have your young children expressed similar anxieties?
20090307063015AAz8bJ0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	How much for child support?	I have a 34 month old daughter, after I got pregnant her father and I split, ok straight to the point, he is an asshole, he has only seen her 3 times, last time was oct 07 and he sends her $100 like every 3 months, sometimes is longer. The thing is I field for child support on feb 07 they send him a letter, he went there, I went there but it all stay in nothing. Every 6 months I have to go there so they can give me a letter saying that the ******* thing is in process, that's for my medical plan. The lady of the place always just give me the letter and that's it, but last time I went (Thursday) she was like, since 07 this thing is going on, and he has not come, what he thinks this is, and she gave some papers to proceed with the case. But I didn't have that in mind. Her father calls me, he doesn't ask about my daughter but he talks to me about his personal problems, and a week ago he called me to tell me that his dad died. He doesn't have any money and he has 3 more children. Only one of them is on the child support service.      The thing is since there is a new law in which in the paper you right down the amount you want to claim for child support, if the person doesn't do anything, doesn't call or go, that's the amount he will have to pay you. All this time I have been living with my parents, they help me and i'm 25. He is 29      The question is. How much should I ask for? How should I feel, I feel bad, when he gets the letter he will be like, what I'm going through and look what you do...

I just tell her " they are for mommy's"  Then the other day when she was going poop, it seemed like it was taking her along time and I went in the bathroom and she was putting a Q-tip up by her butt.

Right before I became pregnant I had lower pain above my pelvic bone.. I found out I was pregnant and thought maybe a paps mare could tell if there was something wrong.. for months the doctors at the hospital were telling me its lower ligament pain on the left.. I know when you are pregnant the organs and such move up.. The pain has moved up to the lower left side. I have done so many test and still nothing has been found.. about a month ago I was tell the doctors the pain is so bad I was on the floor and not moving.. my boyfriend called 911 from that night they have told me they don't know whats wrong.. I have done testing after testing.. I have no clue what this could be, but my question is for a month the ob/ doctors at hospital had me on Tylenol 3 with codeine and they weren't working. My ob switched me over to Vicodin and then put me on Perkasets.. I am so worried that all these changes may not be good at all..  I worry because the pain is so bad and I lost weight and I am throwing up all the time.. The doctors still have no clue what is going on..  I have tried everything.. Is he going to be ok?

20090307065657AAJM02u	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Is it possible to ovulate couple of days or a week before your period?	I have had regular periods when i was on the pill for 6 years, I was on and off having 1 or 2 months breaks, now I have been off them for 7 months now and my periods are irregular, also I don't know when I'm due on or when I'm ovulating, I'm almost 21 and in a stable relationship and trying for a baby. My last period was on the 6th February and now I'm supposed to be due on soon in a couple of days or so, but I've been getting aching cramps on and off through these past 2 weeks like feeling like your going to come on, but nothing, so I assumed I'm ovulating, I bought a Ovulation test and took 1 on the 5th March and there where 2 pinkish lines, one is bigger then the other or darker, or the same, cant really see if they are the same, so I guess its a positive, I then took another the next day on 6th March and same as the other, 2 lines, but according to my calendar I ovulate on the 16th March same as in Feb, so i have know idea when I'm ovulating or due on, its so confusing.

20090307073055AAtPk2h	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Please help. My girlfriend may be pregnant?	This is more information added from a previous question i asked. So my girlfriend and I had sex recently, and we were as safe as possible. I used a condom, and she was on bc. Since the condom wasn't lubed, it was difficult to get inside of her, meaning that there was barely any intercourse whatsoever. I did not come and the condom did not break. Yet, her period is now little over a week late. Her period before we had the sex was short and very light. We did not have sex before she had her short and light period. People say thats normal for women when getting older? And she also added that since shes starting her new months of pills, her period is not going to come? She also has been saying she has been peeing frequently, has bad stomach pains, and has been getting sick easily. She also says she has been gaining weight.       What is causing her period to be delayed? Could she be pregnant? Can anyone explain what is going on? When will she get her period? Should I worry if she doesn't get it this month? I need help, please.
20090307075646AAsJFuN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents, do you hate it when your kid-less friends try to give you "advice" on raising your kids?	My husband and I bowl on Friday nights with another couple that we are friends with.  My husband also works with the guy.  They do not have any kids, and the husband doesn't want any.        Last night we had our daughter with us, and she is forever walking around with her shoes untied, so I said to her "haley, tie your shoes so you don't fall and hurt yourself" and the guy said to me "please and thank you", like reminding me to tell her that.  Ok, fine, I should probably have been a little more mannerful about it.  But, then, the whole shoe tying thing sparked a conversation.  During it, I said, "you know, last week she fell and hit her chin really hard when she was walking into the garage because she tripped on her shoelace.  I felt bad for her, but at the same time, if she would just tie them like we tell her 1000 times a day, that wouldn't have happened."  So, the guy said, "well, maybe you should just buy her some velcro shoes and not worry about it" in a snotty tone of voice, that I could tell meant he thought I was a bad mom because I didn't baby her when she got hurt.  I told him, "well, tying shoes is something she needs to learn.  I can't just leave her in velcro forever!"      Damn, that made me mad.  I am a good mom, and I don't think that expecting kids to learn the basics of life, like tying shoes is something awful!  True, some moms would have made a big deal out of her getting hurt, but it was her own fault for not tying her shoes, and I refuse to baby her for it.      Do you guys have kidless friends who think they know how to parent better than you?  If so, how do you deal with it?

20090307075344AAAnFse	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Delivery Room Dilemma?	I am due on May 21, and am starting to make my plans regarding what will go on when the big day finally comes. My 'boyfriend' of 2 years has just informed me recently that he plans on leaving me when the baby comes.  He wants to be in her life and loves and cares for her, but just doesn't want to be in a relationship with me because we're just "too different."  He says he hasn't left me yet because he didn't want to cause stress during my pregnancy (although in my opinion, the stress is there because I know he's been planning on leaving and he thinks it's better for me to be heartbroken when the time comes).        Due to this revelation, I will be finishing these last few weeks alone and truly stress free.  But my question is this:  He fully expects to be present in the delivery room.  It may sound like I'm trying to be vindictive when I say I don't want him to be there, but I'm afraid it's going to cause more stress than I'm willing to endure during an already stressful experience.  To all you single moms out there--did you have your ex in the room with you?  How did it work out?  What are your opinions?

I don't think I am being unfair to tell my teenage daughter she cannot: pierce her belly, lip, eyebrow, nose etc., dye her hair without my consent, or that if she is going with a friend that I know who they are, number address and where they are going. These are my rules. You break them you are grounded, priviledges taken away. Teenagers today think that everything should be handed to them and that it is their right to have cell phones, laptops, etc. These things are not their rights they are privledges that are earned. "

20090307074112AA5wdqa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Is this a bad time-out strategy?	I just put one of my twins in time out for the first time.  I have redirected them up until this point however one of my twins has figured out how to open the door that leads to the entry way to the house.  After that there is the door to outside.  We need to get a safety doorknob but my husband was gone away on business with our only vehicle all of last week and today he has been at band practice with our vehicle so I haven't had any way to get to the store to buy one.      Either way, I really want them to listen to me when I tell them not to do things anyway so I think it's time to start time-out punishments.      Today after the 5th time I had to stop doing dishes to tell her to stop opening the door and getting into the entry way I put her in her high chair, I told her she was in "time out" for opening the front door, and I turned her around to face the wall so she would understand that she was being punished.  After 2 minutes I got her down and explained that she was in time-out for opening the door and I said "No open door.  No!"      She hasn't done it yet although it's been less than an hour.      Can anyone tell me why putting her in the high chair might be a bad idea?      Thanks in advance!  To me it seems easiest because she can't move when she is up there.         FYI-My twins are 21 months old and I have a 3 week old baby so I really need them to have some moniker of discipline.

My husband and I bd Tuesday, Wednesday, and Saturday. I got a positive opk Sunday. We bd'd Sunday and Monday. I must've ovulated sometime Sunday or Monday and I had the pains associated with ovulation. Then on Tuesday I noticed that still had cramping and lower backaches. On Thursday I notice very light pink blood on tp when I wiped. I even checked by inserting a tampon, and it came out pink. But the dischardge left the same day, and so did the cramping feelings. It is now Saturday, and I don't feel anything and I am worried that I will see another negative test. My period isn't due until 3/14. What happened to the cramping and bleeding? BTW the bleeding never came out of the vagina onto a pantiliner like some people say it does. Is it possible that I was having implantation bleeding? Also, when the answers brand opk shows positive, I think that it means you will ovulate within the next 24-36 hours. I got a + at 9am on Sunday, so that means that I should have ovulated by 9pm on Monday. Plese advise. I am so scarred to get another negative test.

Hi there      I know with PCOS its more difficult to lose weight - as if it wasnt hard enough already!!       Have you manged to lose weight? I am doing weight watchers anyway but not really been that successful on it. Trying to tweak my diet again to make sure i eat enough but healthily       I would like to try for a baby within the next 12 months and am worried that I may have trouble and wonder if I should just come off the pill now anway.  I am currently on a higher oestrogen dosage pill to help fix my overall hair thinning....which was put down to stress but it appears its down to PCOS.       Would love to hear from other ladies and how you have coped and manged weight loss if at all!       Thanks.

I am almost positive that i have already ovulated as i got my pinching in my right ovary over a week ago ( last month on opposite side) now i should be approx 8 dpo. For the past 2 days i have been constipated ( sorry tmi) but that's not what i am concerned about every time i go to the bathroom i get a small glob of cm that falls in the toilet i have checked it and it is stretchy. last time i went to the bathroom ( today) i checked with my fingers and it is clear and is extremely stretchy i can stretch my fingers to the fullest and than it breaks but when i just go pee my cm is watery/lotion i am ttc and have had sex prior and during my ovulation would this have anything to do with pregnancy?

20090307073949AA61jP5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I have had noravirus since Wednesday and have a 9 month old?	As the title says, I've had noravirus since Wednesday. Up until about an hour ago, I had managed to contain it so that I was the only one in the house with it and thankfully my Husband and 9 month old Daughter were a-ok. Anyway, this morning I started to feel a little better and have only been sick a handful of times (if you've had noravirus, you'll know it's not like a normal bout of stomach flu) but just after lunch, mu 9 month old threw up everywhere - not uncommon as she is a bit of a sicky baby but then, 20 minutes later we had poop running out of her nappy in every direction. She didn't cry, isn't off her food anymore than she usually is, is sleeping well, drinking and playing normally but she is now zonked like she hasn't slept in a month and I am so worried that she has caught it from me.      I have been meticulous with soap washing and bleaching and keeping everything away from her. My Husband has had time off work to look after her, so I really haven't even been near her and now I feel terrible that she might have caught it. She's a tall girl and already underweight for her height, so I would hate for her to have sickness and an upset stomach.       I've never had a baby with sickness and diarrhea before. What do you do? Continue with feeding? Cut back to just milk? Offer only cool boiled water and bland, dry food? Obviously, if we get another episode of explosive poop or vomit, she'll be going to the Doctors (although they are telling everyone with anything similar to stay away in order to stop spreading it) but with a baby, it's so very difficult.      Have any of you experienced this or anything similar with your little one?      I FEEL TERRIBLE :-(
20090307074005AATta5B	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 19 month old is so picky!?	All he wants to eat is mac and cheese, grilled cheese, yogurt, and french fries. He does eat a couple of different fruits and other types of snacks. He's never liked eating meat and now won't even drink milk. Has anyone had this problem with their kids and what did you do about it?
20090307074018AAShNmg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My In laws are buddhist and I am Catholic. I want to have my newborn daughter baptized and they told me no.?	Actually they had the great grandmI other call me and tell me that I should be fair and let me daughter make her own decision when she is 18 whether to be catholic or buddhist or whatever. My husband is in the middle because he believes in god too but he was raised buddhist by his strict buddhist family. I don't know what to do...basically they told me that i will hurt the family very much and that if i had any respect for them at all...I don't want to cause all this drama in the family because we are all so close and loving. I just feel this is ridiculous and that it is my right to have her baptized and when she is older she can make her own decision what she wants to be..but they feel as if im forcing it on her but i feel like im not forcing anything on her! Please, I need some advice. I don't know what to do and I don't want my poor husband to be stressed over this. I just want her baptized and for them to compromise. What do you think? Am I in the wrong at all? I don't know...
20090307074218AAO6mUA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My breastfed baby has orange, liquidy poop. It is not usually seedy. Is this normal?	He goes sometimes 8 times a day and sometimes seems like he has a belly ache before he goes. He strains and cries a bit....he is a baby who never cries so I feel like maybe he is in pain? He is fine after he goes and nothing else is wrong with him. From what I have read, this may be normal, but I am not sure. I was thinking maybe he was lactose intolerant. Is what I described consideref diareaha?
20090307074611AAT7mlS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Why cant I get pregnant?	Hi,   I am 20 years old and my husband and I are trying to get pregnant. I've been on birth control for about 5 years. I stopped taking it at the very end of november and we have sex just about every night. It is now the beginning of March and I'm still not pregnant. Does this mean that I can't get pregnant for some reason?
