In antiquity crucifixion was considered one of the most brutal and shameful modes of death. Probably originating with the Assyrians and Babylonians, it was used systematically by the Persians in the 6th century BC. Alexander the Great brought it from there to the eastern Mediterranean countries in the 4th century BC, and the Phoenicians introduced it to Rome in the 3rd century BC. The Romans perfected crucifixion for 500 years until it was abolished by Constantine I in the 4th century AD. Crucifixion in Roman times was applied mostly to slaves, disgraced soldiers, Christians and foreigners - only very rarely to Roman citizens. Crucifixion was public humiliation, victims were not supposed to die soon. Death, usually after 6 hours - 4 days, usually from suffocation, the head would eventually droop forward and oxygen deprivation set in. So to delay the death a single piece of wood was attached behind the abdomen that could be sat on or by the feet to stand.  Hemorrhages and dehydration caused shock and pain, but the most important factor was progressive asphyxia (suffocation) caused by impairment of respiratory movement due to outstretched arms. The attending Roman guards could only leave the site after the victim had died, and were known to precipitate death by means of deliberate fracturing of the tibia and/or fibula, spear stab wounds into the heart, sharp blows to the front of the chest, or a smoking fire built at the foot of the cross if the victim had not exhausted his strength after a few days. Tens of thousands of men were executed on the crucifix; now as far as I know there is really no reliable historical source (the gospels do not count they are flawed and inconsistent) pertaining to the trail and sentencing of Jesus.  But if I had to take a guess to the Romans Jesus’ preaching was a betrayal to the Roman State and the Emperor.|`|c425bd77add075a97bdceeb9591a73bbaa	There is no Roman record anywhere, that says anyone named Jesus was executed by them.  No contemporary records of any kind supporting the existence of such a person back then.  Everything written (outside of the bible), was written hundreds of years after this supposedly took place.<br>  <br>  Put this question in mythology.|`|d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	Romans never wanted to kill Jesus. However, they let the Jews decide and they chose to have him killed. So the Romans applied the death sentence.<br>  <br>  There is more to this story. You should do some extra research as it is quite interesting.|`|5ulr9xLQaa	Jesus was not killed by the Romans.  The Romans allowed the Jews to kill Jesus.  The underlying politics of the day would seem to say that the Romans believed that Jesus would lead the Jews on a revolt against them and overturn the government.  In essence when the Jews found out that Jesus claimed to be the Messiah and that he was not going to lead them against the Romans they said that he had to go.  The Romans told them to handle their business and stepped aside.  <br>  <br>  Rent "The Passion of the Christ." and watch it tonight, you will have your answers.|`|SGymwcmoaa	Jesus was not the only messiah around at the time, you have to put yourself in the shoes of a Jewish person, around 2000 years ago when a massive,pagan occupying force brutally enters your land and you have no defense against it other than your religious beliefs. There were many, who claimed to be messiah's or sent by God, they were all put to death, Jesus just had that little bit of luck to get remembered, the bible doesn't mention huge crowds at his Crucifixion, just his mummy and John. He scared the Jewish authorities who wanted no trouble, and he defied the Roman occupiers who set him out as an example, both collaborated, he wasn't Gods son,just a political activist. See recent History.....|`|1w3k29iuaa	jesus christ was killed by the romans because what he preached was against the jewish high priests. from there, he was arrested by the romans and then was crucified by the pontius pilate. i know there is more and some stuff missing, but this is just the general thing.|`|UR08cIOOaa	Jesus' teachings hinged on the equality of mankind.  During this period the stratification between the low and high classes was great.  The ruling class didn't appreciate someone telling the peasants they were as worthy as everyone else as this would upset to social order.|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	Jesus was killed by the Romans because they were the only ones who could make executions at that time and place. The Jews could accuse Jesus and condemn him, but the execution of the verdict was subject to Roman approval.<br>  Pontius Pilate could not care less about what Jesus was accused of- being a prophet, messiah or son of God was nothing in the eyes of Roman law, so Pontius wanted to release Jesus. He could not do so- because Jesus preached of a "better Kingdom"- and that was a crime under Roman law, simply because the Emperor was (officially) a god and therefore nothing better could possibly exist.<br>  <br>  Essentially it means that if Pontius released Jesus and word of it got to the ears of the Emperor, then Pontius would be toast|`|oFV48JbGaa	Because you touch yourself at night.

q9KsymlIaa	I love this poem. For a young poet it's very sophisticated.<br>  <br>  Do you like Wordsworth? The beginning is very Wordsworthy (for example in his "Tintern Abbey" it begins "Five years have passed - five summers / with the length of five long winters).<br>  <br>  I think the first verse is very strong - I love the image of nickels on the back seat.<br>  <br>  This is a really ambitious poem - it tries to deal with memories and, I think, the nature of memory itself. It is about confusion as much as about clarity. It's hard to pin down whether or not the " I " is the same as the "she" character.<br>  <br>  The idea I get is of a character who can't express her feelings other than in writing, but by setting pen to paper she immediately feels connected not just to her memories (which are vivid and uncontrollable) but to all memories and all lives that have ever been.<br>  <br>  This leads to a breakdown of sorts - the poet's mind cannot process all these thoughts and remain poetic. The figure of the MEMORY LARK is one who can fly free of memories, either by never confronting them, or perhaps because it has found a way to experience the past within becoming drowned in it.<br>  <br>  A very good effort, with some neat imagery. The only issue I have is that writing poems about confusion can easily lead to confused poetry - I don't really buy the series of images about the "him" and "her" - (funhouse mirror, waterfall etc), and the linking of emotional turmoil to a failed relationship (and then to drugs later on?) is a bit of a cliche. You can do better.<br>  <br>  Hope this makes sense! Please leave a comment or message me to say if I got close to your truth about this poem.

Care to elaborate on that? How did we come from monkeys? No one said we did. It is only stated that our species changed over time through environmental pressures.

No.  In fact I wouldn't be allowed to practice medicine until I finished my collegiate studies and many years on internship.  I firmly uphold that this should also be a rule for actors.  If you are interested in acting audition for a community theatre production.  If you like the feeling, do some research as far as acting schools go.  You can look into studying abroad (such as in New York, where schools are generally the most successful) or locally (possibly at a local university).  Keep in mind that everything you did in that community theatre will be wrong.  Professional and amateur acting are separated by a highly developed technique which the actor gains after years of training.  There is so much more to acting than just memorizing lines.  <br>  <br>  In summary: study, and study hard.  If you find yourself not willing to commit to such a task, accept that professional acting is not for you, and continue to involve yourself in community theatre.  Keep in mind that there is nothing wrong with being an amateur: amateur does not mean untalented, it literally means "for the love."  So by all means, if you find any reason not to commit years of your life, countless exercises which push you emotionally and physically to the limit, and thousands of dollars, to acting then find something else.|`|Mig6O93Naa	you start like everyone else starts in your school or neighborhood plays.  you can only have a career as an actress if you are very very good at it (an inborn trait) and have experience and training and are so devoted to it that nothing else matters except God and family. It is the most difficult line of work to make a living at, or even get one single tiny role. You cannot be a teen actor without your parents making it happen.|`|QkTQVPliaa	Search up some performing arts school in your area and sign up for a class.  I live near Philadelphia and I take classes from Walnut Street Theater.  <br>  <br>  For New York, I know there is a very good school for the theatrical arts on broadway, but there are also many others throughout the city or closer to where you live.|`|eL3jebRzaa	Try out for a school play and see how that goes. If it goes really good, keep acting in school plays to get better. Give it your all and don't be scared about what people will think about you, just act your hardest. If you go to church, try out for a church play. When you have gotten really good and other people think you're good as well start looking online or in newspapers for acting jobs. Also, make sure you have your own personal quirk to you're acting, don't be like everyone else, be unique, YOU. Good luck!!!|`|0uoUUAPzaa	I used to be in a modeling agency and tried out for a lot of commercials. You could try starting there, church plays, or at a performing arts center|`|Hzb2dOxcaa	I would do a little research on acting groups in your area. Acting is great fun, and a great way to built up  confidence! But if you want to seriously be an actress, you have got to work hard for it and be a really strong person. Good luck! x

To Zoey, being marked is truly a blessing, though she's scared at first. She has never fit into the human world and has always felt she is destined for something else. Her grandmother, a descendant of the Cherokee, has always supported her emotionally, and it is she who takes the girl to her new school. But even there the teen stands apart from the others. Her mark from the Goddess Nyx is a special one, showing that her powers are very strong for one so young.

If you can break out the robot and risky business, bring a pair of shades, just be dorky! <br>  <br>  Also it won't hurt to get aquainted with hip hop music even be funny and plan what you are going to do to songs that you know that will be playing. <br>  <br>  Also I would warn her that you can't dance. <br>  <br>  If you are going to 'grind', just hold her tight and firm and go back and forth.|`|vF7HO9xGaa	just move to the music - you dont need a dance routine. Its hip hop music so you dont need to know all that posh dance movements.<br>  Just do whatever but dont go OTT.|`|vtYRw2yWaa	Why do you have to know how to dance? I didn't know how to dance, but it still went OK. You just stand there and move around. Most people won't know how to dance. So everyone will look like an idiot together and it'll be fun. Plus girls dig guys who look stupid in public.|`|SsEIbGczaa	To be honest--you do NOT need to know how to dance to go to a dance (I promise!).  If you are in high school and they play hip hop, the dancing will consist of a mix between freak dancing (or grinding).  Freaking: your are facing the same way; you put your hands on her hips so your finger tips are an inch apart, bend your knees (so she could almost sit on your lap) and swing from left to right, while she does what she chooses in terms of rubbing her backside against your front-side.  Grinding: you are facing each other; same stance and movement for you as freaking, but don't bend as much; she will put one leg in between yours, the other outside your leg; you will rub your pelvises together.  Your other very easy option: just copy what you see the other couples around you doing.  However--it would be GREAT if you did NOT freak/dance!!  If you don't know your girl very well, or you don't feel comfortable having her rub her backside against you in public or vise versa, or you just don't want to freak/grind: don't!  There is no rule that says you cannot dance without looking like your are having sex in some form or another--and trust me, everyone is looking at the adorable couple who actually dances rather than the (pardon my french) sluts and jerks.  Now this does not mean you go out and do the foxtrot (not recommended).  This means that you go on the dance floor, laugh, have a good time, and maybe throw some corny dancing in.  The prom will make a better night for you two than anyone else!  Now the easy part: slow dancing.  It sound like you have your partner covered (you have a girl who wants to go with you, congrats btw!), so all you need to understand is how to slow dance.  Understand that there will be couples around you making out, or freak dancing to slow songs (do NOT freak dance to a slow song. period.).  You will need to face your partner, wrap your arms around her *(not as tight as a hug, but tight enough so that you are ever so slightly pulling her in)*, and move your feet slowly from side to side (left foot touch right, right foot touch left; repeat).  She will wrap her arms around your neck (even if she is short--trust me), and will basically do the same as you.  The GIRL determines how close you stand together, by how far she wraps her arms around your neck (most likely, because you are in 9th grade, it will be like a slow song light hug, moving back and forth).  Good luck!!  And remember--she probably doesn't know what she is doing either (most people don't).|`|thZvF7eMaa	well you dont have to be professional now if your dancing with a girl then you just got to remember 123 123 and move side to side but in a circle lol if that makes any since lol good luck
2TLXfQKDaa	It's not bad.  Set side by side, no one is going to say wow these two things look completely dissimilar.  <br>  <br>  A few things I'll point out.<br>  <br>  Your proportions are all around close but not spot on.  The eyes and brows are off.  Their positioning is about right, but they don't match the size of the face.   The angles in the jaw really make the face seem a bit off as well, ignoring everything else it feels more like the outline of a reptile more than it does that of a human face.  Shading can be improved, but until you get everything else down it would pull away from the overall look of the picture.   Anyone can clearly see the resemblance and that in and of itself shows that this isn't absolute crap or worthy of a 1.  Keep it up!|`|OehjuDxVaa	Its distorted. The shading isn't quite right, either.<br>  <br>  When you draw, you want to shade so it looks like there are literally no clear, defining lines. Think of it this way: when you look at a human being, there are no definate lines to their shape.|`|O0PrBp7Yaa	It's okay.<br>  <br>  The face is heavily distorted. I think you should learn how to draw basic aspects of a face, including facial feature placement. Recall basic artistic fundamentals like "the eyes are halfway down the face," or "the eyes are an eye width apart." <br>  <br>  As for the shading, it seems that you felt like you needed to put it at an 'anatomically correct' spot. <br>  However, you must remember lighting and angles/positioning of the face in the picture. Don't over emphasize parts by excessively darkening them. You should take a look at values, and maybe do some research into facial shading.<br>  <br>  While your drawing does need much improvement, I hope you will see this response as constructive criticism rather than demoralization. Artists should never allow themselves to get discouraged. Keep practicing and improving your technique.|`|b5tf7EkTaa	Beautiful, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  I am a fellow artist as well.  Keep up the nice work!  It's super!!!|`|WgI74qD8aa	It's just ok. I would put in a little more detail.|`|lmVkN0VVaa	not bad, try shade it a little more though =] -x-
dd2df7fc5cba9f11d754885dd4f51a59aa	Best thing is to keep your feet on the ground. I am going to be a professional musician, following a farely standard and tedious path of music theory, university and classical music. It's not for everyone. I can recommend making yourself as diverse as possible. Do not just sing things from the 20th/21st centuries, look around for challenging things that will make you a better singer and have historical persistence (I'm thinking of things like Schumann. I'm not a fan of opera but even an aria or too might help).<br>  <br>  Do not expect to be a singer straight away. Many, many, many people are "really good". If you are scouted and manage to make it big, best of luck, but I would concentrate on being as musically educated as you can be.|`|VFMdpVccaa	try proscout my friend just got a callback for it!|`|8y24H37Maa	Sing a song. mimic your favorite artist.<br>  <br>  I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of is car.

0W6caoLeaa	Well first of all good luck.<br>  <br>  Make sure that you are solid in B Flat and E Flat Major (triads, chords, inversions and so on). That's the nature of playing with brass instruments.<br>  <br>  The director will be looking for a steady beat in the bass. It will be your job to provide that steady beat (think drummer with notes). You will need to know what's going on with the other instruments and tie everything together.<br>  <br>  As for improvisation, work off of a whole note scale. Think cadenza passage (up and down arpeggios within the whole note scale or same thing but with blocked chords). Bury the beat at first (if playing solo) but gradually bring it back to the forefront as you wind down the passage to provide the segway for everyone to come back in.

Barbarians attacked Rome, causing the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. Constantinople saw itself as holding the light of Roman civilization up in the middle of a sea of barbarians.

W1h3w5gdaa	Well, classifying yourself as a bass/tenor is confusing. Are you a bass? Are you a tenor? Are you maybe a baritone? Baritone is when you sing the high range of a bass and the low range of a tenor.<br>  <br>  Listen to the works in Phantom of the Opera. Raul is a baritone. The Phantom is a tenor. If I had to hazard a guess, I'd say you should choose a piece written for Raul.

KBBonf97aa	I've played that guitar before and it's as nice as most guitars costing twice as much!  Jasmine guitars tend to have very thin necks and low action (the distance between the strings and the fretboard), which makes them ideal for people just starting to play guitar.  The thinner the neck and the lower the action, the easier and less painful it is to form chords and move quickly between notes and chords.  Jasmine and Ibanez are the brands I usually recommend to beginning guitarists, since both are very user-friendly, where some other brands have fat necks and gigantic bodies that make them cumbersome and challenging to play.<br>  <br>  Ideally, you should go to a guitar store and test drive the Jasmine before buying, since each guitar tends to have its own feel.  The more comfortable a guitar is in your hands, the easier it is to learn and become a rock star.  But if it's not possible for you to play the guitar before buying, it still looks like you made a good pick!  The S34C is a very nice guitar and the reviews are universally favorable.  Excellent choice!  Good luck to you!|`|W1h3w5gdaa	Well, I guess I'll just re-post what I told the last person asking about a guitar:<br>  <br>  In many ways, asking someone "what's the best guitar" is a lot like asking "what's the best flavor of ice cream?" It's not all opinion when it comes to a guitar, but it is more than most people give it credit for. People become fans of a particular brand, even a model, and assume that everyone else in the world should feel the same way.<br>  <br>  The fact is, there are a lot of crappy guitars out there. It's the number one selling musical instrument in North America, and outnumbers the next 5 or 6 top selling instruments combined in terms of revenue and units sold. This means everyone's gonna have an opinion. And you know what opinions are like...<br>  <br>  My recommendation would be to define a price range (which you have) and then go to a guitar store. Play with guitars in your price range. If you think you're not very good and are embarrassed playing in public, get over it. Play to your little heart's content, fall in love with a guitar and take it home. You will never be happier than if you follow that method.<br>  <br>  And, unless it's the only guitar store in town, don't settle. If you don't fall in love with it, don't buy it. Try a different store, and keep playing them until you do. Trust me on this one.<br>  <br>  But to address yours specifically, I have a lot of students who play Jasmine guitars of different models, and I've never heard a complaint. Takamine makes a very fine instrument, but that's not saying much since Fender makes a great Stratocaster, but Squire Strats by Fender are garbage.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|nDcSY8UQaa	You could do worse, beginner guitars are just that, beginner guitars.<br>  in time you'll develop a preference for certain styles and brands if you play enough of them, I use to bug the local music stores all the time when I was a kid, Takemine makes a fine guitar, you may fall in love with it or you may find something that you really love hanging on the wall at your local shop.

It would have just been a recession until FDR extended it into a depression with his New Deal and other Socialist programs.<br>  Govt. stepped in and messed up the economic cycle.<br>  <br>  What could have lasted a few years extended into a 12 year depression which got cured by the production needed for World war 2.|`|4U7327Mzaa	Herbert Hoover believed in pragmatism.  He thought the problem would solve itself if left alone.<br>  <br>  Franklin Roosevelt believed that throwing money at the problem would solve the problem.  <br>  <br>  Over sixty years after the Great Depression, the growing consensus is that Herbert Hoover was much closer to having the right answer.  As it is, we still to this day have left over problems tied to FDR's Alphabet Soup programs.  Some have even said that recent economic woes can be tied back to how FDR handled the Depression.
2TLXfQKDaa	Women are essentially two rhombuses (or an hourglass) and men are rectangles, if you need an example of this I can draw it up for you really quick.  But really that's all you really need to worry about.  <br>  <br>  If you have a problem shaping the clothing then there is another problem, but as far as fashion sketches go, you don't need to be proportionally or visually accurate.  It's ok if the head is just an oval and the arms are just segmented lines.  How you draw the clothing on the stick figure is what really matters.  A couple fashion designers I know have no drawing skills what so ever, but you wouldn't really know this looking at their fashion sketches.  They simple start with a few block shapes and erase lines as they layer clothing on.|`|b5tf7EkTaa	Try this link: <a href="http://www.artprojectsforkids.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.artprojectsforkids.org/</a>|`|zN6CJ3tzaa	I never wanted to be a fashion designer or illustrator, but when I wasn't accepted into the commercial arts program I tried to do the closest thing to it -- fashion illustration. To my surprise, I had a blast and got the opportunity to meet some incredible artists and designers. My favorite was Antonio Lopez -- he was an absolutely amazing artist and an even more incredible person! <br>  <br>  I'll tell you this much; our figures were 9 to 16 heads tall. So from the top of the illustrated model's head to the bottom of the illustrated model's feet -- you could fit 9 to 16 of her heads in the length of her body. Once you get comfortable drawing your figure, you'll be able to stylize to suit what you want your illustrated model to look like. Templates are to help you get comfortable with the fashion figure.<br>  <br>  We had to pay a great deal of attention to the anatomy of the illustrated model and what her body was doing beneath the clothes. The models were drawn on cold press illustration board and the clothes were drawn onto tracing paper. The tracing paper was then hinged to the illustration board. This way, we cold show different looks of fashion on the same figure. It also helped us with catalog presentations.<br>  <br>  That's how we did our figures. There is a site that you can get templates from that might help you a great deal and give you a good running start. If you get a chance, visit and see what they have to offer you. I also included a link to learn more about Antonio. He's passed on, but his work is still amazing!<br>  <br>  Good luck!! <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fashion-templates.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fashion-templates.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://latino.si.edu/virtualgallery/antonio/antonio.htm" rel="nofollow">http://latino.si.edu/virtualgallery/anto...</a> (just click "ENTER" to the left of the screen to see his work and read about him.|`|uC55n3HIaa	Check out <a href="http://www.designerbloc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.designerbloc.com/</a> It's a community for fashion designers to display their designs and meet other designers.

vGid3WG1aa	You are an extremely good writer, and your essay makes a strong point. Good work.<br>  <br>  I have a few criticisms:<br>  1) You use the phrase "a person of colour"- i don't like this expression AT ALL, because we are all coloured people- i am coloured white (and sometimes pink in the heat lol!). You are coloured black. I would change this to "a black person" and not "coloured person." <br>  2) It seems kind of dated. When was it written? Because if it was written 50 years ago, then it makes more sense, but now, in the present, it just doesn't work for me. You say "I was shocked that people--unintentionally--saw my race as ignorant." I don't know what party you attended, but over here in England, this is laughable! There are professional, smart, funny black people everywhere! On the train, teachers at my college etc. I think that few people today see black people as ignorant.<br>  3) You say "be a successful entity in the Black race." ENTITY!?!? You are a human being, not an entity lol! This sentence just seems way to unhuman, like you are an object or something. It just stuck in my mind when I was reading your essay. It makes it more difficult to relate to you, the author, because you refer to yourself as an entity. Quite robotic.<br>  <br>  However, I repeat, you are a very good writer, and the point you make in your essay is a valid one. I wholeheartedly agree with it :)|`|09bd9071f261e20518478352da1dad4daa	Your essay is definitely excellent as well as enlightening!  I hope that you won't mind if I offer a minor critique:  You have three sentences where you've put commas between the subjects and verbs and should remove the commas.  Where you've written ...the Black race, view...; where you've written ...I was a part, believed...; and where ...my father raised me, has taught...  Delete those commas for grammatical correctness.  Additionally, in the sentence where you've written,...I and others like me,... you need a comma after I or else you need to eliminate the comma after me.  Also, I suggest that you insert in the first sentence of the paragraph about the cocktail party: ...felt it abnormal for me to be socially proficient.  Otherwise, I think that your essay is perfect, plus I congratulate for having the courage and confidence to write it!<br>  Addendum:  After writing the answer above, I went to your on-line post; since you've already submitted the essay there, either you may not be able or may not want to make the corrections I've mentioned.  Doubtlessly, others might not notice the errors -- I tend to be a perfectionist and former English major.|`|4F8b4D6Laa	Very good indeed, but don't try to not live up to any stereotype because it's an impossible task, anything that you do people arrange to turn into a stereotypical thing, the best is to be yourself, not even caring much about the stereotypes, and if you spontaneously live up to something stereotypical, fine, if not, even better.<br>  <br>  :)|`|zN2TtO0Haa	i think it's very good. you stay focused in your writing and stick to a main idea. there aren't any grammatical or spelling errors, but the phrase "Black race" seems slightly overused. If this is a stylistic thing you can keep it but avoid repeating yourself very often. maybe say things like 'my race' etc, or use pronouns.<br>  also explain more more about your experiences and how they make you feel, also relate it to what your father says, as that seems to be what draws your essay together.<br>  <br>  other than that, it's very nice. how you write definitely conveys your message which is very cool.|`|AA10064551	I like it and your right...I'm Mexican American and so we totally have our stereo types where people think we are all the same.

When someone is in your life for a REASON, it is usually to meet a need you have expressed outwardly or inwardly.? They have come to assist you through a difficulty, or to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally, or even spiritually.? They may seem like a Godsend to you, and they are.? They are there for a reason, you need them to be. Then, without any wrong doing on your part or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end.? Sometimes they die, Sometimes they just walk away.? Sometimes they act up or out and force you to take a stand.? What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled; their work is done.? The prayer you sent up has been answered and it is now time to move on. When people come into your life for a SEASON, it is because your turn has come to share, grow or learn.? They may bring you an experience of peace or make you laugh.? They may teach you something you have never done.? They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy.? Believe it!? It is real!? But, only for a season.? And like Spring turns to Summer and Summer to Fall, the season eventually ends. Lifetime, relationships teach you a lifetime of lessons; those things you must build upon in order to have a slid emotional foundation.?

1jMwr6E0aa	Well for American girl biblical names I'm going to suggest my nieces name; Genesis. I think the name is broad for a variety of characters. It could easily be used for a timid character or for someone more bold, like my niece whom we've nicknamed "Genesis The Menace" (she's 3) Also a suggestion, my roommates name Esther. She prefers to be called Esty. Other names to consider Ezra, Ruth, and Judith. <br>  <br>  I'm particular to unisex names for girls due in part to my own name mostly so I like names like Jordan, Alex, Kelly, Terry, and of course Cameren.<br>  <br>  Keeping with the biblical names for boys (though I'm not sure of your intentions for that) could be Joshua, Luke, Peter, Daniel, Paul, Jacob, Isaiah (I actually know someone named Isaias), Jeremiah, Jonah, Micah, Joel, and Matthew. <br>  <br>  Other male names not biblically related that I enjoy are Dante, Roman, Xavier, and Royal.<br>  <br>  Japanes female names could be Mika, Miki, Hina, Kana, Sayuri, Sumi, really you could think of an English name and find that word in Japanese. Take Sayuri for instance Sa means small and Yuri means Lily. Which might be better off for you to do being you can decide if their name has any significance to their personality. <br>  <br>  Don't forget to explore nicknames incase none of this is really helpful.

LnauanNxaa	I'm only 13. I won't lie to you. Sometimes I get thoughts in my head. Crazy, selfish, neurotic thoughts I can't control. Sometimes I want to feel flesh underneath my fingernails and blood running down my hands. I get random bursts of elusive energy that can last for minutes or hours. I don't think I know where you're coming from. But I certainly understand your frustration. I live in a fancy, perfect little town. I don't act like anybody here though. They don't want any opportunity. All they want is to get rich, thin and pregnant. It's stifling here as well. You seem brilliant. You have a stunning tone to your written words. Don't give up. I'm an avid philosophical studier. I strongly encourage you to read "The Mystery of Man," by Frankl. It is a terribly disturbing, and enlightening account of events set in a Nazi concentration camp. People in these camps would set imaginary dates for their freedom. They would count down these days. They'd live to the fullest for these days. When their date came, with no obvious freedom, they'd die the following days, due to lack of motivation. Believe in yourself. Trust yourself. Don't give your life a due date. When I'm in need of min stimulation, I turn to philosophy. It makes me think. Your passion could translate into a strong political will. Try politics. Try anything. I wish I could help more. No one can ever understand what another understands. I can only understand myself to the ebst of my ability and relate that to what you've written. I hope I've helped. Peace.|`|yOK32PM9aa	Yes, the answer is in your final paragraph.  You are too good for this.  You definitely don't deserve this, and asking these sorts of questions means that you are still fighting to improve things and one day you will be free.  Don't worry about the diagnoses - they are just labels people put on you because it is their job.  I do urge you to take all your medication, though, because it might give you the space to think things through.  Plenty of people take endless pills; there are people who live on vitamin pills because they are so worried about their food!  If the psychiatrist says you are fine, and you can express your thoughts as clearly as you obviously do, then you are not mad.  You are going through a tough time, that's all.  If there are lots of stressful things in our lives, we get stressed.  Be patient, don't do anything to make it worse, and the bad times will pass, like they always do.|`|pexxZB8Daa	Just find something you like to do! Improve your grades! Exercise, be healthy!

People just have different ways of doing that. You've been through a lot and you could be a very inspiring person if you let other people know. You can change someone's life. Maybe some people will start to be more caring and decent after hearing your story. It's very touching.|`|oTehE3LIaa	I struggle with horrible, intrusive thoughts as well.  Really really bad stuff.  You know, the sorts of stuff that could put us either in the hospital or in prison...<br>  <br>  And for me, sometimes it got the point where I wasn't sure if I'd actually done the thing or if I was just afraid of doing it.  Do you know at all what I mean?  <br>  <br>  These thoughts and fears are still really a struggle for me--they have been since elementary school at least.  But several things have really helped me.  Do you have anyone you can go to with the thoughts that are attacking you, anyone you can be truly open with, who won't flip out on you?  I've noticed that, regardless of what thought is bugging me, if I can just share it with somebody (which is often a humiliating thing) then the thought loses much of its power.  I know you mentioned that your school counselor was no help.  For me, I have several people at my church who are a huge support system for me.  Do you have a church that you attend?  <br>  <br>  This is a good forum where you can chat with folks and find some support for your ocd-- <a href="http://www.ocdtribe.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ocdtribe.com/</a><br>  <br>  Finally, the thing that has really helped me is my relationship with Jesus.  Because I am so AFRAID of doing the wrong thing.  I am so AFRAID of guilt.  But Jesus has washed away my guilt, so that even when I still feel guilty, I can know that those are just feelings and that He has truly forgiven me for my sins.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  All the best to you.|`|s3FRQJ3Xaa	I was once told "Be everything you could possible be". Yes your life isn't easy but there are so many more people out there that don't even have a family, or are homeless or are starving hungry. Don't give up. So many people who have problems like you, do make something of them selves. Your still young and have a lot to learn about life. Look at your problems as challenges that need to be over come. You will surprise your self one day and most likely be giving advice to someone else who feels like you do now.

Not to mention some of the most well-known, talented ones as well. It seems like your life is filled with struggle, and you will be struggling alot. With your issues, plus fighting with others during a bad economy, will cause even more problems. Try harder in school and get whatever help you can get there. ANY college degree will win over the ones with just a high school diploma. You have to be good at something, is it sports? Is it arts? Anything? Find something that you are good at and try to stick with that as well, and find a job along those lines. Practice is the key. Yes, You have a future. You just have to try--HARD! Very very very hard. You will cry, you will struggle, and you will have breakdowns, but keep trying. A good future will happen to you eventually, you just have to work for it.

I thought they were emotinally not properly operational?<br>  <br>  You're operational, and mature, and totally, totally spot on tone-wise and in all ways sounding right royally effed off at some stuff which you have an aboslute right to feel right royally effed off at.  I am not catching anything from what you're saying which does not make me feel you are a perfectly normal young adult.<br>  <br>  Do your family have munchausens by proxy or something?  At the risk of being responsible for what I say (please God, noooo!) where are they all going with this?  There's too much psychobabble out there, it gives me the creeps.  You say you're socially dense but what does that mean? that you've been kept in an ivory tower forever and had no practice, or that you truly do stare at light switches instead of people's faces when they talk.  Can you tell when people are happy/sad?  My bloody husband can't always tell and nobody's diagnosed him!  Can you truly count all the peteals on a flower just looking at it?  What is the garbage in your head?  Email me, I'm dead curious and I don't want to catch myself lying to you because you've come off well in your question.<br>  <br>  There is no reason for asbergers to stop you having a life anyway.  I think you need to find a way to get the hell out of there:  which you've noticed - start low and work your way up.  You don't have any alternative - but get some mom-and-pop oeration if you can, not a big walmarty place because you will need extra teaching if you wish to climb the ladder - ie old pop eventually hands you the cashbook because he can't be 'donkeyed' (sorry, rude word police everywhere) whereas you'd never get that sort of training in a larger organisation.  You don't have the same job security but you get far more out of it in a small place.<br>  <br>  When you've worked for a while you can think of your next step.  It'll be a mission hanging on in there while you endure the time it takes to get established but you can do it: you've hung on in there for 20 yrs so far, six more months will not tip you over the edge when you've got a reason for it.  One thing's for sure though; you absolutely need to get something moving before you lose your mind.<br>  <br>  Asbergers smasbergers (don't even know what OCD is):  your life would drive anyone up the wall.<br>  <br>  Oh bother, editing already:  anxiety shmanxiety as well.  Anxiety is too many chemicals running around due to:<br>  <br>  1.  too much information in a new experience.  Break it down and do the bits slowly.  Don't let anyone rush you when you learn, you have to go at your pace.<br>  2. anxiety breeds anxiety. fear of anxiety makes a person anxious.  What about fear of fear of anxiety?  Hell, that's circular:  bad logic.  Bin it.  <br>  3.  you can choose not to have an anxiety attack. Sounds mad, but you can.  you have to dominate it.  We all get it, but people who haven't seen a shrink deal with it naturally, which is to grow past it, grow bigger than it.  overwhelm it right back.  It's kind of a trick or a knack.<br>  4.  huge amounts of resident stress cause anxiety when you're tipped over the edge: the straw that breaks the camel's back.  Learn where other stress comes from & resolve it. Yes, permission to laugh: but don't see anxiety as long-term.  Don't see it as a 'disease'. See individual attacks as a sign of overload to the system and look around for all of the different loads.<br>  <br>  Gotta go, can spew forth forever and type 120wpm so must stop!!!<br>  <br>  :o)|`|6066028c7e454217f272dd7abd4de1a0aa	No, your life is not over.<br>  Yes. you have a future.<br>  <br>  Laying hold of these things will require effort. You have a good mind and a strong will, so you're capable of making the effort. Whether you will or not, is up to you. If you do, your life is not over and you have a future.<br>  <br>  1. You need God in your life, specifically Jesus. It is fashionable these days to immediately dismiss that option, but reflect on something: Fifty years ago, when our society as a whole still turned to God first, in times of trouble, your neighborhood was a nice place to,live. Now, when the cultural affectation-of-choice is to dismiss God, everyplace is beginning to look like your neighborhood. Think about it. These things don't happen by themselves.<br>  <br>  You don't need to go out and do anything. God is everywhere, and He wants to help you. Just drop the barriers, And stop mouthing off to him, if you have been. "What has God done for me?" and "I've tried all that and it doesn't work," and "It's all a con" and all the other hip stuff people say doesn't bother God at all. He's complete in Himself, and He doesn't get bothered. But rapping out all that nonsense does hurt you, because it sets up barriers. Drop the barriers, Give Him permission to enter your life and help you. Particuarly, because you won't be able to do the rest of it without help.<br>  <br>  Here's the rest of it.<br>  <br>  2. Take responsibility for your life. <br>  <br>  The heads and the dealers aren't nice to look at, they aren't great neighbors and they're probably occasionally dangerous. Your mother has said some stupid things to you, mainly because she's a person and people can be relied upon to occasionally say stupid things. You have an unimpressive GPA. You are obviously intelligent. You could have done better. For reasons you thought valid at the time, you chose not to. Get over it. It's behind you, so bury it. Let it fade into the mists of unpleasant--and now unbothersome--memory.<br>  <br>  You are a man. You need to practice manliness. Manliness is all about taking satisfaction from overcoming obstacles. <br>  <br>  Make up your mind you're going to prepare to take on the responsibilities of manhood, and quit demanding the privileges of an infant.<br>  <br>  3, Start taking your meds and seeing your doctor regularly. What's the problem about taking four pills a day--or forty, for that matter, if you need them and they're doing their job?  This is a place where you can really trip over your vanity and wind up in a mudhole. The only person<br>  who has any negative feelings at all about you taking your meds, is you. Hearing you'e not doing it, the reaction of the entire sane world is<br>  not, "How brave!", but  "Wow, that's dumb!"<br>  <br>  4.  Start caring about yourself. If you don't already, shower every day. Make your bed when you get up. Put your stuff away. Start helping out around the house by washing the dishes and doing the laundry every so often.<br>  <br>  You're unemployed, right? So, you have time. Get into the habit of doing productive things by starting at home.<br>  <br>  5.  Change your habits. Nothing is going to magically zap you into manhood. Manhood is a structure that is built on responsibility.<br>  <br>  Responsibility isn't easy, and our culture mocks it (and this has<br>  gotten us where...?), so your'e going to need to just make up your mind you're going to be a responsible man whether anybody likes it or not.<br>  <br>  If your friends are losers, slackers and stoners, stop seeing them. Find a church. Go to it. Make friends there.<br>  <br>  You see, if you decide to change your life, it'll change. If you decide to sit there and feel sorry for yourself and blame the rest of the world for your mistakes, it won't.<br>  <br>  Your life is far from over, my friend. It's hardly even begun. The cynicism and the world-weariness are common among twenty-year-olds, and your unenviable circumstances are shared by most of the world. Ask, "Why me?" All you'll get back is, "why not?" That's the bad news. <br>  <br>  The good news is that your choices are vast. You may feel stuck, but you aren't.  You are a young man wth a brain in your head, and the mistakes you've made are repairable if you set yourself to the task. Take your meds--they'll help you get out of your own way.<br>  <br>  You most certainly do have a future. It's up to you to put your foot on the road to it.  <br>  <br>  If you want, drop me a line at revjvr@yahoo.com .<br>  <br>  Blessings--<br>  <br>  Fr. Jim +<br>  <br>  Fr.

AhzwAMxYaa	Not exactly.  He's looking at a crucifix (or some picture of Christ crucified) and is asking us to contemplate the person in it.  The poem form is a sonnet.<br>    The "translation" would be:<br>       What if tonight were the last night of the world?<br>       Soul, look in my heart where the image of Christ crucified is and tell me if it frightens you. The tears in his eyes quench his amazing light/life, the blood which fills his frowns fell from his pierced (by the crown of thorns) forehead.  Can that tongue send you to hell which also asked for forgiveness (Forgive them, Lord, they know not what they do).<br>      No, no, but as I said in my idolatry (Donne didn't always write religious poems, he wrote quite erotic ones first) to all my mistresses "it's a pity you are beautiful == foulness is a sign of  hardness.  So I say to you, wicked spirits are given horrible shapes while this beauteous (beautiful) form (shape) ensure that it will be looked upon with pity.<br>  <br>  HOpe this helps.|`|7355ad702ae490769df9563b4fb4bed6aa	I agree with you, that's what I got out of it. I never read his later works, which is what that passage is, but I think what you said makes sense.<br>  <br>  <br>   When he was younger he wrote about philosophy and had lots of interesting ideas. He pushed cultural boundaries. Then he got old, became a priest, decided he had been a "bad person" (because of questioning the church), and wrote only about religious topics. <br>  <br>  What a shame :(

His love poems are quite vigorous. So from here to the end, he is contrasting worldly beauty, and that now he finds beauty which arises from a mind which attends to Christ's death.

For the electronic-book reading software, see Lexcycle Stanza. For the Scottish poetry festival, see Stanza Poetry Festival.<br>  In poetry, a stanza is a unit within a larger poem. In modern poetry, the term is often equivalent with strophe; in popular vocal music, a stanza is typically referred to as a "verse" (as distinct from the refrain, or "chorus").<br>  <br>  A stanza consists of a grouping of lines, set off by a space, that usually has a set pattern of meter and rhyme.<br>  <br>  In traditional English-language poems, stanzas can be identified and grouped together because they share a rhyme scheme or a fixed number of lines (as in distich/couplet, tercet, quatrain, cinquain/quintain, sestet). In much modern poetry, stanzas may be arbitrarily presented on the printed page because of publishing conventions that employ such features as white space or punctuation.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Stanza names<br>  Stanzas can be given a specific name depending on their structure and rhyme pattern.[1]<br>  <br>  List of stanza names according to number of lines:<br>  <br>  2-lines = Couplet <br>  3-lines = Tercet <br>  4-lines = Quatrain <br>  5-lines = Quintain <br>  6-lines = Sextain <br>  7-lines = Septet <br>  8-lines = Octave <br>  Other stanza names:<br>  <br>  Triplet <br>  Ballad stanza <br>  Sestet <br>  Burns stanza or Scottish stanza <br>  Ottava rima <br>  Sicillian octave <br>  Spenserian stanza <br>  Balassi stanza <br>  Onegin stanza <br>  <br>  [edit] Examples<br>  One of the most common manifestations of stanzaic form in poetry in English (and in other Western-European languages) is represented in texts for church hymns, such as the first three stanzas (of nine) from a poem by Isaac Watts (from 1719) cited immediately below (in this case, each stanza is to be sung to the same hymn tune, composed earlier by William Croft in 1708):<br>  <br>  Our God, our help in ages past, <br>  Our hope for years to come, <br>  Our shelter from the stormy blast, <br>  And our eternal home. <br>  Under the shadow of Thy throne <br>  Thy saints have dwelt secure; <br>  Sufficient is Thine arm alone, <br>  And our defense is sure. <br>  Before the hills in order stood, <br>  Or earth received her frame, <br>  From everlasting Thou art God, <br>  To endless years the same. [etc.] <br>  Less obvious manifestations of stanzaic form can be found as well, as in Shakespeare's sonnets, which, while printed as whole units in themselves, can be broken into stanzas with the same rhyme scheme followed by a final couplet, as in the example of Sonnet 116:<br>  <br>      Let me not to the marriage of true minds                             <br>      Admit impediments. Love is not love                                   <br>      Which alters when it alteration finds,               <br>      Or bends with the remover to remove:               <br>      O no! it is an ever-fixed mark,                    <br>      That looks on tempests and is never shaken;         <br>      It is the star to every wandering bark,             <br>      Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. <br>      Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks  <br>      Within his bending sickle's compass come;            <br>      Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,      <br>      But bears it out even to the edge of doom.           <br>      If this be error and upon me proved,                 <br>      I never writ, nor no man ever loved.                 <br>  Divided by rhyme scheme, the poem can thus be separated into three stanzas followed by a single couplet:<br>  <br>      Let me not to the marriage of true minds             <br>      Admit impediments. Love is not love                 <br>      Which alters when it alteration finds,               <br>      Or bends with the remover to remove:                 <br>      <br>      O no! it is an ever-fixed mark,                      <br>      That looks on tempests and is never shaken;        <br>      It is the star to every wandering bark,             <br>      Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.<br>     <br>      Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks  <br>      Within his bending sickle's compass come;           <br>      Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,     <br>      But bears it out even to the edge of doom.           <br>     <br>      If this be error and upon me proved,                 <br>      I never writ, nor no man ever loved.|`|VFMdpVccaa	a set of lines(usually 4-8)|`|xK2IMLPLaa	A stanza like in a poem?

In much modern poetry, stanzas may be arbitrarily presented on the printed page because of publishing conventions that employ such features as white space or punctuation.<br>  <br>  [edit] Stanza names<br>  Stanzas can be given a specific name depending on their structure and rhyme pattern.[1]<br>  <br>  List of stanza names according to number of lines:<br>  <br>  2-lines = Couplet<br>  3-lines = Tercet<br>  4-lines = Quatrain<br>  5-lines = Quintain<br>  6-lines = Sextain<br>  7-lines = Septet<br>  8-lines = Octave<br>  Other stanza names:<br>  <br>  Triplet<br>  Ballad stanza<br>  Sestet<br>  Burns stanza or Scottish stanza<br>  Ottava rima<br>  Sicillian octave<br>  Spenserian stanza<br>  Balassi stanza<br>  Onegin stanza<br>  <br>  [edit] Examples<br>  One of the most common manifestations of stanzaic form in poetry in English (and in other Western-European languages) is represented in texts for church hymns, such as the first three stanzas (of nine) from a poem by Isaac Watts (from 1719) cited immediately below (in this case, each stanza is to be sung to the same hymn tune, composed earlier by William Croft in 1708):<br>  <br>  Our God, our help in ages past,<br>  Our hope for years to come,<br>  Our shelter from the stormy blast,<br>  And our eternal home.<br>  Under the shadow of Thy throne<br>  Thy saints have dwelt secure;<br>  Sufficient is Thine arm alone,<br>  And our defense is sure.<br>  Before the hills in order stood,<br>  Or earth received her frame,<br>  From everlasting Thou art God,<br>  To endless years the same. [etc.]<br>  Less obvious manifestations of stanzaic form can be found as well, as in Shakespeare's sonnets, which, while printed as whole units in themselves, can be broken into stanzas with the same rhyme scheme followed by a final couplet, as in the example of Sonnet 116:<br>  <br>  Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br>  Admit impediments. Love is not love<br>  Which alters when it alteration finds,<br>  Or bends with the remover to remove:<br>  O no! it is an ever-fixed mark,<br>  That looks on tempests and is never shaken;<br>  It is the star to every wandering bark,<br>  Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.<br>  Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks<br>  Within his bending sickle's compass come;<br>  Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,<br>  But bears it out even to the edge of doom.<br>  If this be error and upon me proved,<br>  I never writ, nor no man ever loved.<br>  Divided by rhyme scheme, the poem can thus be separated into three stanzas followed by a single couplet:<br>  <br>  Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br>  Admit impediments. Love is not love<br>  Which alters when it alteration finds,<br>  Or bends with the remover to remove:<br>  <br>  O no! it is an ever-fixed mark,<br>  That looks on tempests and is never shaken;<br>  It is the star to every wandering bark,<br>  Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.<br>  <br>  Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks<br>  Within his bending sickle's compass come;<br>  Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,<br>  But bears it out even to the edge of doom.<br>  <br>  If this be error and upon me proved,<br>  I never writ, nor no man ever loved.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanza" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanza</a>
1A4klmh7aa	Harry Potter gave a generation of youth a profound appreciation for the written word. There had not been a fantasy series to capture the attention of so many in a long time. Before Harry Potter, the most read young readers series were the "Goosebumps" books by R.L. Stine. <br>  <br>  Not only have these books changed the lives of many of the readers and most especially the author (who went from being on government assistance to being one of the wealthiest people on the planet), but they have influenced popular culture.<br>  <br>  The world is flooded with Harry Potter references. Harry Potter is mentioned in other films, songs, and books. It is parodied, it is debated, it is studied. <br>  <br>  It is one of the best selling book series of all time. It is a series of blockbuster movies. It sells millions upon millions in merchandise.  <br>  <br>  There have even been subcultures spawned from Harry Potter. Similar to the filk communities of Science Fiction, there is an entire group of musicians who write and perform and record songs about Harry Potter that has a rather large fan following. Wizard Rock keeps Harry Potter alive even after the books have been completed. <br>  <br>  The Harry Potter fans are so completely enamored with the books that they refuse to see them die, which is fairly uncommon for books. Relatively few series have had that kind of impact on their readers throughout time, and the Harry Potter effect is kind of unique. <br>  <br>  The fans keep the books alive by writing fan fiction (which is not discouraged by the author, but supported), role playing, and discussing them in forums. By reading them repeatedly and attending fan conventions. By listening to Wizard Rock and keeping the Harry Potter community alive on the web. <br>  <br>  It's an incredibly large and steadfast group of people what have been affected by Harry Potter.<br>  <br>  And even the people who dislike it, the people who fight against it, who protest the Harry Potter books, who complain about them, who burn them, who say Twilight is better, they still recognize the existance of the books and make them that much more visible. <br>  <br>  There are very few places in the developed world that you can go where someone will not know about Harry Potter or will have not heard of Harry Potter.|`|4F8b4D6Laa	I would have to research a lot to be able to tell you this, and I hope what I have to answer at least adds to your knowledge. <br>  <br>  My friend not only started to read more, as HP truly changed her life, increasing her self-steem in a time where otherwise she'd be completely lost.

That would make it much easier to change your SS number's name, and driver license, etc. As a woman, you can actually do that now, since most paper pushers have forms for changing names, assuming you are marrying. As a man, you generally need the court order to get people to go through the motions.

It would be a good story if an 13 year old wrote it for a school project, but I think the story is way to sappy and predictable.

By setting up the characters with extravagant, but vague descriptions and personalities, anyone can relate to Bella, Edward can be anyone's dream boy, and all the people reading it can pretend for a while that that could happen to them to. they get to escape into Edward and Bella's relationship, which really does look perfect on the surface: it's only once  you think about it that you realize everything that's wrong with the books and a lot of these people are not in the habit of applying critical thinking to books.|`|nhNa2NZuaa	I think that Twilight  series give hope to people who feel like they may not have any.

s5i9atFpaa	Your father is referring to the spirit realm. It is right here with us, but at a different vibrational level ( like a different frequency of sorts)  that we cannot normally experience with our physical senses. You know how there are sounds at frequencies so high we cannot hear them but a dog can? It's kind of like that. Just because you cannot hear the sound does not mean it does not exist. the dog certainly can hear it. We as humans are also spiritual beings, but are living in a limited three dimensional world when we are in a physical body. There are limitations in our ability to sense certain things because of this. Physics has proved that there are more than three dimensions, despite the fact we inhabit a three dimensional world. Resultingly, we are generally unaware of the other dimensions that exist simultaneously with us. Think of a drawing on a sheet of paper of a cartoon character. The character on the paper would only be aware of what it experienced within the surface of that paper. Now imagine a sheet of tissue paper laying on top of the paper with the cartoon character. On this tissue paper is another cartoon character, who can see thru the tissue he is on an recognize that there is another cartoon guy on the sheet underneath. But the character on the first sheet cannot see the one on the tissue paper and lives his cartoon life oblivious to the fact that the guy on the tissue paper even exists.  <br>       We can learn to tune into this other world. we often do as small children, but adults tell us it is make believe and eventually we believe it and most people eventually believe it. Long story short, both worlds, and possible others, exist simultaneously but at different vibrational frequencies. We generally are not tuned to the higher vibration of the spirit world unless we consciously choose to be.|`|2nsUmrV5aa	Nope. He's wrong.

We'll never know, we can't know, and any time we spend thinking about it is a waste of time.|`|26DoxkOBaa	I think this is a good explanation. It's from a book review of God Speaks which I have discovered by myself to be the meaning of life.<br>  <br>  The first phase of God's journey is evolution. It is initiated from a totally unconscious God as if an infinite Ocean were in a state likened to deep sleep. This unconscious God speaks the First Word "Who am I?". This question disrupts the limitless, undivided, absolute vacuum, and its reverberations create individualized souls, compared to drops or bubbles within the Ocean. By speaking the First Word, God establishes the process of Creation, in which he assumes evolving forms to gain increasing consciousness.<br>  <br>  Individuality is the vehicle of this quest. Evolution marks a series of temporary answers to "Who am I?" The soul traverses a multitude of forms, beginning with simples gases and proceeding slowly through inanimate stone and mineral forms. These early evolutionary stages obviously have only the most rudimentary consciousness and cannot provide a satisfactory answer to God's original question.<br>  <br>  The original query thus provides a continuing momentum for the drop soul to develop new forms each with greater consciousness, including the many plant and animal beings. Every evolutionary kingdom reveals new dimensions of consciousness and experience. Each also offers opportunities to gain different kinds of awareness. For example, when the soul identifies itself with varied species of fish, it experiences the world as a creature living in waterconversely, as a bird, it enriches its consciousness by flying through air.<br>  <br>  When the drop soul finally evolves to human form, consciousness is fully developed, but an individual is still not aware of the potential of his or her consciousness.<br>  <br>  So the original "Who am I?" imperative persists and inaugurates the second phase: reincarnation. Since consciousness is fully developed, there is no longer a need for evolving new forms. The individual's experience, gathered in early stages of evolution, is now humanized and expressed in countless lifetimes. The impulses gained in sub-human forms can play themselves out in the broader context of intelligence, emotions, choices, diverse setting and interactions with people.<br>  <br>  But obviously no single lifetime can bear the burden of "humanizing" the entire evolutionary inheritance randomly or simultaneously. There must be a method for re-experiencing the pre-human legacy in manageable segments. The soul thus experiences alternately a series of opposites, organized according to themes. Accordingly, in different lives, the soul becomes male and female, rich and poor, vigorous and weak, beautiful and ugly. Through exploring the potential of these many opposites, one eventually exhausts all possible human identities and, therefore, has fully learned the entire range of human experience.<br>  <br>  Here begins the third phase: involution, the process by which the soul returns to the full awareness of the Divine Force, which created him. As Meher Baba puts it, "When the consciousness of the soul is ripe for disentanglement from the gross world (the everyday world of matter and forms(, it enters the spiritual path and turns inward."<br>  <br>  Like evolution, involution has certain states and stages, consisting of "planes" and "realms." But individuality continues along this spiritual path. In fact, the book quotes the Sufi saying "There are as many ways to God as there are souls...."<br>  <br>  Each new plane denotes a state of being that differs from the states that proceeded it. The first three planes are within the subtle world or domain of energy, "pran." There follows the fourth plane, the threshold of the mental world, where misuse of great power for personal desire can lead to disintegration of consciousness.<br>  <br>  The fifth and sixth planes represent true sainthood, which is understood to be increasing intimacy with God as the Beloved. On the sixth plane, the mind itself becomes the inner eye that sees God everywhere and in everything. "The loving of God and the longing for His union," says Meher Baba "is fully demonstrated in the sixth plane of consciousness."<br>  <br>  The seventh plane marks true and lasting freedom. Impressions go. Duality goes. The drops burst and again become the Ocean. God answers his question of "Who am I?" with "I am God." The Infinite has returned to the original starting point. He now knows, however, with full consciousness and full awareness that he was, is and always will be infinite. And he realizes that the entire journey has been an illusory dream, the purpose of which is the full awakening of his soul.<br>  <br>  You can download the entire book, God Speaks by Meher Baba, for free in PDF format at:  <a href="http://www.ambppct.org/meherbaba/BooksByMeherBaba.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.ambppct.org/meherbaba/BooksBy...</a>|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Yes.

[that theory is called ex nihilo] There was no beginning, as there can be no end.<br>  <br>  Do not think of "nothingness" as the default position of the beginning of the universe. If "nothingness" was at one time the state of existence, then that makes "nothing" something real. "Nothing" cannot be a something; it can only be the absence of a something. Then all of our logic, all our science, and yes even our religions are false because God cannot exist outside of existence. Nothing can, or language means nothing. <br>  <br>  However, here is the metaphysical theory of "somethingness" as the default position:<br>  <br>  "Existence is a self-sufficient primary. It is not a product of a supernatural dimension, or of anything else. There is nothing antecedent to existence, nothing apart from it—and no alternative to it.

Mig6O93Naa	You mean you have a script in hand to have memorized by Sunday? contact me and I will send you my three page outline on how to learn lines.  Practice your song.  Lots.  The only way to loose stage fright is to gain experience, to be well prepared and to learn to enjoy the opportunity of auditioning. You need to realized that acting is fun and auditioning is an opportunity to act and therefore to have fun and so when you audition you have fun. If you don't like to audition, then forget it.  The important thing has to be that you are having a good time with this opportunity to perform for people.  Who cares if you get the part? Just go have fun.  When you can think like this, you will succeed.

And doing these stretches and practicing your splits will also help with your high kicks. Kicks also take strenght and flexibility so doing leg lifts and practicing your kicks will help with your kicks. The most important thing is to keep a smile on your face and enjoy yourself.

MHFuJGdGaa	Have you taken any classes?  Are you familiar with Stanislavsky, Meisner, Adler, Strasberg?  I doubt it, you haven't even finished highschool.<br>  <br>  <br>  Consider this:  If I were to be a surgeon, would you expect me to practice medicine straight out of high school?  No.  In fact I wouldn't be allowed to practice medicine until I finished my collegiate studies and many years on internship.  I firmly uphold that this should also be a rule for actors.  If you are interested in acting audition for a community theatre production.  If you like the feeling, do some research as far as acting schools go.  You can look into studying abroad (such as in New York, where schools are generally the most successful) or locally (possibly at a local university).  Keep in mind that everything you did in that community theatre will be wrong.  Professional and amateur acting are separated by a highly developed technique which the actor gains after years of training.  There is so much more to acting than just memorizing lines.  <br>  <br>  In summary: study, and study hard.  If you find yourself not willing to commit to such a task, accept that professional acting is not for you, and continue to involve yourself in community theatre.  Keep in mind that there is nothing wrong with being an amateur: amateur does not mean untalented, it literally means "for the love."  So by all means, if you find any reason not to commit years of your life, countless exercises which push you emotionally and physically to the limit, and thousands of dollars, to acting then find something else.|`|Mig6O93Naa	IF you want to be a teen actor (make sure you are decided whether to be an actor or an actress) your parents have to make that happen for you because it is against the law for anyone under 18 to sign a contract of anykind.

If you're just getting started, you'll probably want a guitar with a thin neck and low action (the distance between the strings and the fretboard), since that will make it easier to move around quickly between chords and notes.  And some guitars have larger bodies than others, so you won't know which size feels the most comfortable to you until you try handling the different models.<br>  <br>  I've always been partial to Ibanez guitars, which are built like rocks, sound magnificent, and are often nicer than guitars costing twice as much.  They also tend to have thinner necks than most acoustic guitars, which has been helpful to me, since I have small hands.  Jasmine by Takamine guitars also tend to have thin necks, as do some Fender models.  Epiphone makes great, inexpensive guitars, but they generally have fat necks that can make them challenging for beginners.  If you're still young and think a full-size guitar is cumbersome, don't rule out 3/4 size guitars (also known as parlor guitars).  A lot of kids start out playing them and they're even showing up in the hands of professionals these days, since some of them sound great and they're much easier for people with small hands or bodies to play.<br>  <br>  If you want to do some research before going to a store, you can check the listings on Musician's Friend.  You can search by brand, price or customer rating.  The site also has customer reviews that are hugely helpful, since they'll alert you to potential problems with certain brands or models.  I usually do research on the Musician's Friend site, then go to Guitar Center and play the guitars that caught my interest based on the reviews.  Here's a link to the acoustic guitars on MF:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/acoustic-guitars/6-string" rel="nofollow">http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/acous...</a><br>  <br>  The most important thing you can do is choose a guitar that feels really natural in your hands.  A lot of people will try to steer you toward their favorite brands, but one person's dream guitar is another's nightmare.  Just do a little research and trust your instincts, since you'll know which guitar feels most comfortable to you.  And the more comfortable the guitar is, the more you'll play and the better guitarist you'll become.  Good luck!|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	You need to go to the music store and play around with them until one feels right for you.|`|W1h3w5gdaa	This is certainly a popular question. Fortunately, I have the same answer for all of them.<br>  <br>  In many ways, asking someone "what's the best guitar" is a lot like asking "what's the best flavor of ice cream?" It's not all opinion when it comes to a guitar, but it is more than most people give it credit for. People become fans of a particular brand, even a model, and assume that everyone else in the world should feel the same way.<br>  <br>  The fact is, there are a lot of crappy guitars out there. It's the number one selling musical instrument in North America, and outnumbers the next 5 or 6 top selling instruments combined in terms of revenue and units sold. This means everyone's gonna have an opinion. And you know what opinions are like...<br>  <br>  My recommendation would be to define a price range (which you have) and then go to a guitar store. Play with guitars in your price range. If you think you're not very good and are embarrassed playing in public, get over it. Play to your little heart's content, fall in love with a guitar and take it home. You will never be happier than if you follow that method.<br>  <br>  And, unless it's the only guitar store in town, don't settle. If you don't fall in love with it, don't buy it. Try a different store, and keep playing them until you do. Trust me on this one.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, and have fun!!

KADDz1EPaa	A very good question, well done, but too difficult to answer.<br>  by diagonal
2e8PuGy3aa	To be a professional model you need a beautiful face, good teeth, healthy hair, nice smile, and great legs. As important as looks are sizes - a model has to fit the sample sizes perfectly. Standard measurements for a female model are 5'9" and taller with 34" chest, 24" waist and 34" hips. Even with the perfect stats, there are no guarantees of work. There is literally no work for petite models in Toronto. Shorter girls (5'7" or 5'8") work in Asia and there is a good petite market in some American cities (difficult because of the work visa). Body measurements for petite modelling are extremely small. Be wary if an agent tells you there is petite work in Canada.<br>  <br>  Where to start my friend?<br>  Modelling agencies have "open calls": a time each week where a new model can go and see an agent. From this meeting you might be asked to join with this agent. I would recommend seeing several agencies before committing to anyone. If a particular agent isn't interested in representing you they will give you feedback and advice (if asked). Advice from the top agents should usually be listened to. A good agent has nothing to gain by not giving truthful feedback.<br>  <br>  Best agencies: Ford Models, Elmer Olsen Model Management, Sutherland Models, B & M Models, Giovanni Model & Artist Management, Elite Models, Trump Model Management are some.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|D9x1QSgiaa	Well....If you have money to blow, you COULD attend a "Modeling School or Academy".....but they are not always what they are cracked up to be. In fact...I would venture to say that MANY of the best, well known professional models have NOT attended a modeling school. The problem is that MANYYYY of them are nothing but a "front" for a photographer or his business. Of course the Modeling School or Academy will insist that all of your photos come from this ONE photographer...so it's all about money, money, money. Many modeling agencies won't ask the model if she was "schooled" by a professional Modeling School or not. <br>  <br>  Since experience is more important than school, it doesn't really make THAT much difference if he or she was or not formally trained. I have gotten some excellent results from many of the models I have used who have NEVER attended a Modeling School. Some of the best models are children. They don't have too many bad habits, but they can be impatient at times. Most models can do well if they are given 10-15 minutes of coaching and instructions they usually catch on well. <br>  <br>  What is also important in the whole process is your ability to make a GREAT portfolio...that is....a decent album of your best shots in a variety of settings. That includes swimsuit photos, head shots, formal wear, product promotions, you name it. The portfoilio must display the model in a variety of settings and backgrounds to display to a potential advertiser that she is versatile and capable of promotion the product or merchandise in the way that best reflects the image of the company and appealling to their clientele. I have used many models who never show their face....so good looks don't ALWAYS carry a lot of weight either. Many times I am taking photos of their hands, back profile or some other body part.<br>  <br>  If you are over age 14-15 you are considered to be "late starter" in THIS business.....many models are starting at around age 12, 13 or 14. If you have waited until age 15 or 16, you have already lost a lot of time on the competitors. Many models are finished by age 28 or sooner.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you find a good photographer who is capable of helping you make a portfolio. Some photographers (such as new photographers or college students) may work with you on what is known as TFP...(Trade for Photos)...in other words.... you sign a Model Release allowing the photographer to use your photos for FREE and he/she supplies a good selection of photos for you to keep (for FREE) in your portfolio. One hand washes the other in this kind of agreement. <br>  <br>  Also....your BEST choice of Modeling Agencies WILL be in the larger cities...New York, Boston, L.A. , San Francisco, Atlanta, Miami, Dallas, Houston, etc.....but I don't necessarily suggest that you move, until you are better established. Also...don't be afraid to post a few photos HERE for us to see as well. Be sure to have an online presence at websites such as modelmayhem.com, onemodelplace.com or other such sites. Making your OWN site featuring YOU (and ONLY YOU) is also a great idea. You need business cards with your face on them and your website address. You'll need to also print flyers with 3 or 4 great shots of you. They need to be mailed to modeling agencies (not the schools), ad agencies, and anyone else you can find who could use you in the promotion of their business in any way. Agencies DOOOO look at these sites from time to time to scout for new talent. There are probably some decent photographers in the YOUR area or some other nearby larger city.<br>  I also suggest that you go to www.newmodels.com   and read everything you see there for more information.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|OHfZFR31aa	Abercrombie chooses their models from their employees.

n9hRyHpqaa	Understand, I am just beginning to figure out iambic pentameter.  I don't think S1, lines 1 and 3 are that.  Mystics and moment have the stressed syllable first and it needs to be second: da DA da DA. Same with very last line.   And abab rhyme first stanza.<br>  Other than that, it's a cool poem.|`|S9bEtVCSaa	I think it follows the rules - I'm no expert on iambic, but it seems a bit off - maybe someone with more expertise can help you with that part.|`|dQmFoRRiaa	When I read this aloud (twice) it seemed to falter in meter in the first and third quatrains.  Each line must be written in iambic pentameter in those stanzas, and you do not have the right metrical foot much of the time.  Also, you need an abab rhyme scheme in the first quatrain, and my phonologically trained ear does not discern even a valid slant rhyme for the first and third lines of your opening quatrain.  I like this concept and the content, but you have some work to do to meet all formal requirements and to enhance metrical flow.  Please do persist and I'd love to read your rewrite.

BuYUttpHaa	i had trouble finding a mag before..  i did find a site that had every mag i could think of,,even hard to find ones|`|00363b82d8a3408aeb964fe9253d354baa	The best is to subscribe NG magazine and stay tuned on special issues, for 15 yo, its my bet !!!

AA10729675	This is very touching.  The kiss is sometimes the most important moment in love.  This one contained all the love there is.  The rest would have been prose.  Here it was all poetry.  It is better than if there were a continuation, with everyday life and chores.  This is excellent.  I cannot say what I like so much without repeating the whole text.  The three paragraphs are very clear in the progression.  Well done!|`|c9b7d2ec51921e6d7ad4f6cbaca8d1bbaa	These could be stolen lines from various books and other sources, and just strung together to make up what you have. Nothing to get exited about though.|`|YmtNel5haa	that is beautiful..<br>  I could see it in my mind...<br>  thanks for sharing this.|`|eeHrcxjEaa	Overall great.<br>  -----------COMPLIMENTS----------<br>  -I liked this part:<br>  A moment of silence followed while our eyes kissed and caressed and desired.<br>  -And this part:<br>  Perplexed and with searching eyes I looked for her, lost somewhere among the crowd, when I finally saw her again, waving me goodbye and saying with her eyes, "I loved you".<br>  -And the whole first paragraph. <br>  <br>  -------------------SUGGESTIONS--------...<br>  "My heart was galloping on the pleasant turf of happiness." = I think you could find a better word than "pleasant" here, and a better word than "happiness".  Try like... "ecstasy", or something more vivid.  And try changing it to "My heart galloped" instead of "My heart was galloping".  That changes it from passive voice to active voice, which makes it more interesting for the reader and makes it easier for them to imagine it.<br>  <br>  "Then her lips touched mine, softly and sensually, and I greedily kissed life. A wet and dry and most delicious kiss. I could feed on her kisses forever, as nourishment to my soul."  <br>  This part leaves the reader confused. It makes it hard to imagine the kiss. It was both wet and dry? Sensual and soft but greedy? And the "I could feed on her kisses forever" makes you sound like a leech, or a parasite or something.  Not sure if that was the imagery you were going for.  <br>  <br>  EDIT: (something I just noticed)<br>  "She could easily be mistaken BY a Renaissance masterpiece of sculptural beauty."  ...I think you mean "for" instead of "by".  <br>  <br>  <br>  But great job overall, it's mostly very vivid and exciting! :)|`|8Jt7Uroeaa	Your what's ichy?

The first thing you do is hit me over the head with a cliche. You have right there lowered my expectations tremendously. <br>  <br>  Replica of the next is a nice image. <br>  <br>  Exoticism is a corny word. 3 dollars for that when exotic means the same thing for 50 cents. It felt juvenile. "She has it with adjective adjective and she wears it with adjective adjective." No life in these words.<br>  <br>  "by a Renaissance masterpiece" or FOR?<br>  <br>  Second paragraph is adequate.<br>  <br>  Wet/Dry? Sounds like you are confused. Maybe I haven't kissed enough phantasms.<br>  <br>  The vanishing act is as anticlimactic as the "I love you."<br>  <br>  Doesn't make me want to read more.

lPxVt2XYaa	When I first saw this film I thought it was confused, over-long and rather strange.  But I found that I was thinking about the imagery, the horrors and the desperation of it for weeks afterwards.  As a narrative it is disjointed, but it is a masterpiece.  It shows the easy brutalism of war, even the partizans are not seen as heroic, but as people brutalised by the hell that has engulfed them.<br>  I also went to the town of Oradour-Sur-Glane in France, not long after seeing the film.  The town is preserved just as when the Germans left it - ruined.  There are small plaques all over the town that tell the visitor who died in each location.  In a small courtyard I saw an old French man on his own, in his peasant blues, his shoulders shaking, weeping - it brought the film back and how, although it is a fiction, the realities it represents happened across much of Europe.<br>  BTW, the Soviets liberated Auschwitz just 6 weeks before they got to Berlin, I defy anyone to behave according to the rules of war after that experience.|`|AA11942204	Plus the Red Army raped about a million German women in 1945.|`|RLQPWkXCaa	Yes, and?<br>  <br>  Then again, remember that the Russians treated their own people just as bad. If a commander thought there was a mine field ahead, he would order his own men to run into it to show where the mines were.|`|g1dUcKyiaa	Not to mention that the Japanese soldiers weren't all that civil either; need the "Rape of Nanjing" be brought up?
AASxKRiAaa	All right.<br>  1. The first letter of the first word at the beginning of each sentence must be capitalized. <br>  2. Use a semicolon (;) between "into it; she was good at that." <br>  3. Incorrect: 'Well' i thought fiercely,'this was the last time,...again.' <br>  Correct: "Well," I thought fiercely, "This was the last time...again." <br>  Besides that, it was very engaging and all spelling was correct.|`|OeKgopilaa	wowwwww...that's amazing!! it sounds really good!|`|G4XkXsbeaa	"I wasn't sure why I was so scared of this place" contradicts the following sentence. Your protagonist is scared because he/she's heard horrifying tales that a terrible being lurks in the darkness in the room your character is in. <br>  <br>  Try punctuation and grammar. You could use some of that.<br>  <br>  My edited version:<br>  <br>  I had heard horrifying tales of a creature that lurked in the darkness in this very room, frightening me. Not a monster or being this was, but something more unnerving than a beast.<br>  She had succeeded in talking me into this. All she had to do to make me jump was snap her fingers. Well, I thought fiercly, this is the last time; there is no way I will ever do anything like this again. <br>  Beckoning to me, I had no choice but to follow her.|`|4BvFnxTyaa	Keep it up! You don't describe too much, yet not too little either. Just enough to beckon me to read even more, like she convinces the main character to enter the Room. I'm looking forward to hearing what the Room actually is! Though when the protagonist says, "'this is the last time, there was no way I was ever doing anything like this again.'" it's pretty much a run-on sentence. You could just insert "and" in between "time," and "there." Dazzling!|`|B1LkXUKvaa	Very descriptive and intriguing. how long do you plan to make this thing? Don't keep posting more short experts like this, because somebody could steal your work. especially if it is a short story. and the fact that is very good and some people cant write at all makes it that much more probable.|`|kmzCMDlHaa	its good! keep writing!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck,<br>  ~~Anna~~|`|isRPmjS7aa	really liked it<br>  and its detailed well|`|SA2PGI3Qaa	Good so far

It was just so boring!  Also the end of eclipse and the middle part of breaking dawn where he tells the story... stupid guy -.-|`|N8mIlAm2aa	I don't hate the guy cause in another book he'd be a totally interesting person. He is just incredibly out of place herev in a novel about sleek sexy vampires and incredibly unnecissary as there are already enough characters with tension and unbelievability. Stephanie Meyer needs to realise that there is no competition with Edward. None at all. And pretending there is only seems like cheap trick to increase melodrama. Oh and ditto for the werewolf subplot too (if you're going to expand the mythos, make Angela a witch...wait no do that anyway cause it would be cool).

ByM5bvqsaa	This happened couple of months ago. I'm not good at telling stories but I'll try.<br>  <br>  I was in my office. My previous supervisor who's also one of my buddies now walks in and he goes and says "Yo yo yo wat up wat up" with hand gestures to my new supervisor. (My new boss is black and our office is mostly girls, guess my buddy wanted to look cool) The girls in the office then thought they must be close buddies, but it turns out they don't even know each other! My new boss says, "Excuse me?" My buddy just kept on talking but obviously embarassed at the time. Then my new boss says, "Excuse ME?!" The girls in the office were now trying hard at the time not to laugh out loud. My buddy not knowing what to do, just keeps on talking again and finally my new boss says "Sir, can we please step outside the room."<br>  Right after they stepped out, all the people in my office BURST OUT into laughter. We laughed and kept talking about it for like the whole week!!<br>  <br>  Like a week later when I saw this buddy of mine, I brought up what happened and he got so upset lol. I never brought it up once again. But every now and then, I'd greet him "Yo yo wat up" and he'd say nothing. So I try not to greet him that way anymore. LOL|`|fYwrSBB0aa	I remember the time, that as of right now I never got my first kiss from a girl.|`|PxVDtnSzaa	My boyfriend was laying on his bed.

But, sadly: alone too often.|`|yOK32PM9aa	It depends on the circumstances, but it is best not to think of these two as mutually exclusive.  If you lie about doing good, then you can remedty the situation either by becoming good to justify your lie, or by confessing your lie and telling the truth about your behaviour.  But the best option is to change your behaviour and also come clean about it.|`|f95837e2c58a8931580191a2a6bfe0d2aa	For the sake of convenience, the first is what everybody is doing. The rest of it implies changing the lie, meaning making the lie a truth,which is an impossibity. At best, we can accept the lie - changing our behaviour in the process to fit the lie, making hypocrites of ourselves, and not changing our behaviour ensuring our eventual dissociation with the lie, but never our changing it.|`|WMkJ1GQyaa	Change the lie to reflect the truth. It's harder though I suppose.|`|i6d582PFaa	none of the above    it is better to believe and seek the truth.
VQLJrTKCaa	you have to understand that nothing in ballet- when done correctly- doesn't hurt. yes, it is supposed to hurt to go en pointe because that's not what feet were made to do. ballet- especially pointe work- is a lot about pushing beyond the body's physical limits, be it turning out all the way to 180, repeating a petite allego or grande allegro combination until you're about to drop, or pointing your foot in flat shoes or pointe shoes until your arch is screaming. ballerinas have extremely high pain thresholds because of how far and how often they push themselves. don't lose heart if it hurts! keep trying, and also try different shoes. if you have too much pressure on your big toe, it's likely because your shoes aren't tapered enough for your feet. pointe shoe fitters are taught that too tight is far better than too big- which is true! they should feel tighter than street shoes, pointe shoes should fit like a glove!<br>  <br>  happy dancing!|`|Z19gRYZwaa	When you say they are tight, do you mean that they pinch or that your toes are crunched up in your shoe, or simply that you have no wiggle room? If the former, your shoes are too small; if the later, then that's how they are supposed to be: loose pointe shoes are a recipe for blisters. They shouldn't hurt when you are on flat, but they should be pretty close to skin tight. You can expect it to hurt a bit when you go on pointe: it's not how your feet are supposed to work. You will get used to it/learn to manage it over time.|`|G2mJppm0aa	You need training, and they will break in. <br>  <br>  Watch the first minute or so of 'Center Stage', you will see what I mean when they are trying to break in new shoes.|`|iCpDKt5Caa	all dancers experience the same problem you have.. its not even a problem. your pointe shoes need to be broken in. your ballet teacher should help you do this.. some teachers say to carefully bend the pointe shoe to get it loser or even sometimes bang the shoes against something to soften the plaster (i wasnt taught to do any of these coz it can actually break the pointe shoe if youre not careful). in the mean time to get your feet use to your shoes do a few rises making sure that you go through the whole foot- flat-->the ball (stay there for a while and make sure that youre pulling up all your muscles) and then finally go up en pointe then do the same thin going back down [pointe- ball- flat], repeat this a few times. it will most probably hurt to start off with but once you have your pointes on you can lightly wet across the top of the plaster area where the ball starts just to soften it up a bit (be careful not to wet too close to the pointe!) <br>  <br>  hope this helped :)|`|XevGRqBlaa	it might hurt at first, but eventually, you'll get used to it. i mean, once you've been dancing for awhile, it won't hurt so much, especially once you know how to do steps en pointe correctly. if you got your shoes from the store (a dance store like SF dance or something) and got your shoes fitted, then your shoes should be fine. Good luck en pointe!!!

bdYXd8exaa	Protagonist Isabella "Bella" Swan is thrown an eighteenth birthday party by Alice and Edward Cullen, the vampire she loves, and the rest of their vampire family. While unwrapping a gift, she gets a paper cut. Edward's brother Jasper, although attempting a non-human diet, is overwhelmed by the scent of blood and tries to attack Bella. In an attempt to keep her safe from the world of vampires, Edward tells Bella that he doesn't want her anymore and leaves the town of Forks, Washington, with his family. Bella becomes severely depressed and seeks comfort with Jacob Black, an old family friend who eases her pain over losing Edward.    Bella and Jacob begin spending a lot of time together, and Bella soon discovers that the rush of adrenaline present when she places herself in dangerous situations stimulates hallucinations of Edward's voice. Bella begins seeking out dangerous behavior, such as riding a motorcycle, to trigger the illusions. Meanwhile, Bella finds out that Jacob is a werewolf. The werewolves begin to protect Bella from the pursuit of the vampire Victoria, who seeks revenge for the death of her mate, James, who was killed by the Cullens in Twilight. After Bella attempts cliff-diving near La Push, she gets caught in a riptide and is rescued by Jacob.    At the same time, Alice Cullen, Edward's vampire sister who has visions of the future, has a vision of Bella jumping off the cliff. Presuming that Bella is dead, Alice rushes to Forks to check on Charlie Swan, Bella's father, while Edward calls Bella's home. Jacob answers and informs Edward that Charlie is at a funeral, referring to that of a man in town who had died of a heart attack, but Edward draws the conclusion that Jacob means Bella's funeral. Desperate after Bella's supposed death, Edward flies to Italy to see the Volturi, peace-keeping vampires who would be able to kill Edward, granting him leave of a world without Bella.    Bella and Alice rush to Italy to stop Edward, and save him before it is too late. Before they leave Italy, the Volturi tell them that Bella, a human who knows of the existence of vampires, must either be killed or changed into a vampire herself. After they return to Forks, Edward explains to Bella that he only left in order to protect her, and she forgives him. The book ends with the Cullens voting in favor of Bella being changed into a vampire after her graduation, much to Edward's dismay.    The novel references to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and compares characters.|`|M3pHTXOcaa	yes. jacob|`|SFxQyTfJaa	of cause  1Bella gets 18  2Edward leaves her because the birthday party went totally wrong (she had cut her self in a house full of vampires)  3Bella is quiet, say nothing for 6 months (cause Edward is gone)  4Then she remember jacob and they both get best friend (she drive to la push etc....   5finds out that he's a werewolf (he got one and his behavior seemed strange to her)  6best friend etc... he wants more etc...  7Than Bella jumps of a cliff (just for fun because friend of jacob did this befor)  8Alice saw that and though she was dead(she wasn't)  9tells Rosalie who tells Edward who then go to the volturi to kill him( don't want to live with out bella)  10 Alice and Bella want to rescue him and went to Italy   ( Volturi don't want to kill him so he he want to go out on sunlight so that they have to kill him)  11 they find him in the last secound and every body is happy xDD    (went back to forks)    :D|`|3kZ1jkxaaa	Vampire leaves, Girls turns basket case.

CjPtAEzmaa	:) I'm going to be honest, it's good, but it is a little cliche. Let me tell you something we learned at writing camp.    I can't remember which is right brain and which is left. I think right is creative. So I'm going to go with that. XD    When describing things, you have to let your right brain take over. Because your left brain analyzes things and gets scared. Will other people think it's good? Does it sound professional? Does it sound too crazy? And it picks safe, boring adjectives.    But the right brain runs wild and says what makes more sense to people around the world.    For example, if your left brain was looking at a tree, it might say, "Red. Green. Yellow. Rustle. Wind. Leaves. Rough bark."    But if your right brain saw it: "Magical towering blimp-earthspring rush!"    XD So you probably have to find a balance. But the big thing is, don't worry about whether it sounds good or what other people say. Just say it like you see it. Not methodically and planned out, just like you see it. Put it on paper. Does that make sense?    So, hmmm. On actually helping you come up with a description, I can't help you. XD I can't see him like you can. But I know you can do it! It wasn't that bad to begin with, I'm certain it will only get better!    EDIT!!!!!: Okay, I thought of something to help you more. XD You know how you keep wanting to use words like sculpted and chiseled, and say he's beautiful? Why not describe him by comparing him to a Greek statue? Not only is this palatable to the reader, it gives you a chance to develop the character who likes him. For example's sake, I'm going to say her name is Kayla and she comes from a pretty rich family.    So, example using this situation:      He reminded Kayla of one of those Greek statues she had seen last summer on her family's trip to Italy: sturdy jaw, perfect body. Only difference was she could see the sparkling splendor of his green eyes and dark, furry eyebrows. Plus, he wasn't naked.    But this is probably way off. Think of what your female character would think of Greek statutes. Actually, now that I read through your ? again, you never said you had a female character who liked him. XD Oh well. I hope you do, or I just wasted my time :P|`|jYxdoIA2aa	'a pair of thick, but not unkempt, black eyebrows.'      'a pair of' - that sounds funny -   'but not unkempt' makes the reader think too hard about the tidiness or otherwise of these -     your description below when you are communicating to us as opposed to 'writing' works better -     'He has dark hair and green eyes (not sure about 'framed' - suggests they go all the way round) with thick, dark eyebrows.  (Dark hair with green eyes is pretty well always a gorgeous combination so maybe you don't have to spell it out too much.)      As for the 'sculpted from honey coloured marble' - I could take it if this was your female character thinking this of a man she has in her sights but, as authorial voice, it does sound a bit too smitten without really conjuring up what he looks like.      I don't mind 'sculpted jawline' - it may be cliched but some men do have fantastically honed jawlines - it's the 'honey coloured marble' that doesn't do it for me - I start thinking of all sorts of stone trying to work out what colour this chap is.      Would go for simplicity - go for a non-fancy, simple, literal description then get on with the story.  Come back to this bit later.  Maybe you'll find the simple description says it all.    p.s. to answer your question: 'purple prose' is "a term of literary criticism used to describe passages written in prose so overly extravagant, ornate, or flowery as to break the flow and draw attention to itself. ."  quoted from Wikipedia|`|bEMbgvOLaa	I'm not trying to sound mean but are you using imagery or purple prose?I can't tell whether you sre using both of them.|`|MF7fRQrbaa	I think it depends on who is writing about him. Is it another character or just the narrator.  Anyway here's an example for each.    Character POV:    "Her eyes scanned his face which was strong with a jaw line that looked as if it was sculpted from honey coloured marble.  Her eyes were drawn to his deep green eyes perfectly framed by his thick eyebrows. She had never seen a man so strong and yet beautiful looking."    Narrator POV:    "His face was strong. His jaw line seemed as if it was sculpted from honey coloured marble.  He face was perfectly formed from his dark black eyebrows to his beautiful green eyes.  A modern day Michaelangio statue."    Hope this helps.    Good luck and happy writing!!|`|393940f30f6cfc163edbaa3a9238ca9baa	'His face was strong, with a jaw line sculpted from honey coloured marble and a pair of thick, black eyebrows arching enticingly above his liquid green eyes.'

Hope it helps|`|zYZIw0Mqaa	Purple Prose is the repeated description of the same feature, or otherwise - continuously describing the same thing. This came from the following excerpt; "Your opening shows great promise, and yet flashy purple patches; as when describing a sacred grove, or the altar of Diana, or a stream meandering through fields, or the river Rhine, or a rainbow; but this was not the place for them. If you can realistically render a cypress tree, would you include one when commissioned to paint a sailor in the midst of a shipwreck?"    You see how it's just talking about the same thing?

Consider something along these lines, so you've worked your description in to the flow of the story. If you just say "he had brown hair and it was parted in to curtains" then you've lost the readers attention immediately. With whatever you choose, remember show dont tell is crucial.<br>  <br>  Also, a writer needs to take all things in to consideration.

The large wooden branch barely holding him up as he leaned further out trying his best to get to the strange parcel. After almost 3 weeks stuck on this sweltering sandy beach he was not going to lose this battle, even to something he could not defeat. Finally, his dry, scratched hands grasped the odd package and quickly snatched it back. He scrambled down from the boulder in the shallow water and splashed up to the beach, his curiosity almost overwhelming. He slowed and landed on the sand, ripping the sodden brown wrapping off only to reveal a mirror, slightly rusted at the sides. Although he felt a slight disapointment, he gasped as he saw his reflection. A deep purple bruise stretched itself down beside his left eye, scabbing cuts either side of his face which had lingered since his mad dash through the dense trees running from a wild boar. He had grey under his eyes and his face looked sunken, pale yet burned. The only thing which was remotely normal was his brown hair, short but shaggy and slightly greasy but light and feathery all the same. <br>  <br>  sorry to go on i got caught up :D xxxxx|`|BzMQejGxaa	Does his hair colour matter? If not, just describe his personality.<br>  <br>  Don't go overboard with the 'ooh his long flowing locks like brown rivers of wonderous delight' route.<br>  <br>  The best way to describe it is having it affected by something, normally the wind, but it could be rain, sun, combing it, running fingers through it, etc.|`|4BvFnxTyaa	"His hair was as brown as a flowing river of chocolate delight."<br>  Just set your imagination free and concentrate of the texture and five senses your character's hair has. Is it smooth or rough? Is his hair bright or deep? Too much description might ruin the mysteries, though.

I could go through ancient history and talk about all the ways the Romans were oppressed from rule under the seven kings to Gallic and Germanic invasions and I am no closer to understanding the truth about Roman history.<br>  <br>  My point is that you shouldn't write history and just talk about the ways in which a group of people were oppressed. When people try to assign a moral good or evil to history, they are USING history for their own advantage. Its nothing but propaganda. But when you take a balanced approach to history and simply try to discover truth without assigning a moral good or evil qualifier, you are not USING history, but promoting it. <br>  <br>  Think about it this way. If I where to write a paper that concentrated on the ways and which Hitler was oppressed in the beginning of his career in an effort to cast the man in a sympathetic light, I would be labeled a monster (and rightly so). I would be ignoring a huge half of his story and be no closer to discovering truth. <br>  <br>  My advise to you is focus on a single event in jewish history.

That is history.|`|OxHfK88paa	I think the English King Edward of around 1300 (around that year) made all jews wear yellow stars and wanted to use them as a scapegoat for the people.

Z0v6G0Kgaa	Good lord--I wish people would stop thinking of the movie "300" as being even 10% historically accurate--it's so full of crap, nonsense and fantasy as to be almost useless.  Herodotus wrote the only detailed history of this battle.  Histories followed up by interpreting Herodotus.  Stephen Pressfield than wrote "Hot Gates."  The comic book "300" was then based on "Hot Gates."  And then the movie "300" took liberal deviations from the comic book.  For instance, Herodotus says that it's Dienekes that says "so I guess we'll fight our battle in the shade" when it's pointed out that the Persian archers are so many that they blot out the sun--not Leonidas (as "300" the movie has it).  And Leonidas actually dies relatively early in the battle on the last day--and than the Persians cut his head off and display it via chariott to all their forces.  But then, that stuff wouldn't make such a good movie would it.  Oh, and the movie "300" is so laughable--Leonidas wasn't some buff hunk, he was at least over 50 years old by the time this battle happened and possibly as old as 60.    1.  The Spartans sent almost 1,000 men of combined arts to fight.  2.  They were not "body guards."  The "Knights" were the equivalent of his Prateorian Guard.  But the first requirement for anyone going with Leonidas was that they had to have been a sire (ie: had fathered a child) so that their family name would continue.  The Spartans--professional soldiers raised to fight in combat--recognized this for what it was:  a one-way mission.  So it was more than just his personal set of Knights.  3.  There were dozens of other Greek nation-state armies at Thermoplae as well.  Probably the most memorable were those from Thespes (who like the Spartans, stayed to the bitter end--none of them left when the Persians discovered the goat path around the pass--but than "300" ignores that reality).  For instance, there was a substantial Athenian naval presence.  Total numbers of all of the Greek forces were somewhere between 4,000-7,000 (with about 1,000 of them being Spartan).  4.  There are a bunch of reasons why Leonidas went with only 1,000 men to the Hot Gates.  --the rest of his army was coordinating with the larger greek forces (especially the Athenian Navy) and Thermoplae was aimed at being a holding action to buy time.  None of the Greeks say Thermoplae as being a possible victory.  --Leonidas was in charge at Thermoplae.  Someone senior had to be there.  --Contrary to what "300" says, there wasn't a religious festival that prevented the rest of the Spartan army from going, they were actually uniting with other Greek forces into a combined army.  No, the oracle told the Spartans that they would either lose a king or lose their city.  So Leonidas knew that he would die (if not at Thermoplae, than someplace else).  Besides, the Spartans had been raised since birth not to fear death.  They all went into battle with a coin to pay the ferryman across the river Styx and mentally prepared to meet the Gods.|`|xQwU590Laa	He had a few thousand allies of other city states to help.

He died fighting for Sparta, and that was something he truly believed in. Spartan warriors were very capable fighters, so they must have taken a lot of Persians with them to Hades.    One must beware of using ones own modern morals to call ancient historical figures "foolish."

It's beautiful synthesis of the three primary advantages of Western Civilization (individualism, free inquiry, and decisive shock battle; all inherited from the Greeks and all alien to the rest of the world almost to this day) has the added virtue of debunking the marxist economic theory (reduced to further absurdity by the the statistic-mad Paul Kennedy whose thesis subsequent history has already discredited) and the more recently fashionable germs/natural resources canard.|`|AA10725882	Paul Kennedy's 1987 book "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict From 1500 to 2000" covers the politics and economics of the European Powers from 1500 to 1980 better than any other source I have read.

Also the development of warships needed to protect the trade.

XevGRqBlaa	Just keep working hard, and your teachers will notice, but dont be too disappointed if it takes a little while for them to promote you. your muscles need to be developed properly and you need to know how to use them too for you to go en pointe. keep working on your technique and you will get stronger and even better at ballet. so just keep trying your best because pointe and ballet are really fun, and its worth the wait. good luck! :]|`|iCpDKt5Caa	pointe isnt as easy as it looks and you cant just go up en pointe like that. all dancers have had at least 3-4 yrs or more training to strengthen their bodies properly for pointe and most of the time going up en pointe is an invitation. to go up en pointe you NEED to have your body trained correctly otherwise you can do some serious damage to your feet and ankles (not only that.)<br>  <br>  yes you may be good but may not be good enough to move up just yet and especially go up en pointe.<br>  <br>  just make sure you keep working hard and you will get there someday, just not right away.<br>  <br>  good luck =]|`|xnDcmV1xaa	You may have to wait, because it does take years to get to that level.<br>  You could cause injury, as stated.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, practice going up on releve randomly. lol that is what i do :) perfect your barre exercises because they will improve your balance.<br>  <br>  Also, try out other forms of exercises that may strengthen your legs, like swimming, biking, etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|vF7HO9xGaa	trust me. i just got pointe shoes - and there not all what they're cracked up to be!. I have been doing ballet for 10 years. im almost 15. <br>  Your dance teacher will say when you can get pointe shoes - mine did.|`|3Tq4rZm7aa	don't be in a hurry to be en pointe. you'll get them when your teacher thinks you are ready. I'm almost  years in ballet but i still don't have my first pair of pointes... so let's wait okay? <br>  <br>  work hard in the routines and make sure that you know the terms and how to do he steps properly. lock your legs while standing, jump higher, plie lower be more graceful and NEVER LOSE YOUR POISE..<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK?!|`|b4twAWp7aa	If your body isn't properly trained you can really hurt yourself on en Pointe. And trust me the pointe shoes are painful. Your teacher will tell you if your ready or not for pointe. It took me 8 years to get into pointe because I started when I was 5. But if you are really serious about it try enrolling it 2 classes and maybe decide about getting a private tutor. With really hard work you can get into pointe in no time (:|`|DjircW6waa	It's not just a matter of learning the terminology.  Most studios require several years of ballet and pointe is by invitation only.  Even if you are a quick learner, pointe is very hard on your feet, legs and ankles.  You need to put some more time in to really develop the strength in those muscles.  Try enrolling in at least 2 regular ballet classes.  The teacher will see how serious you are and promote you more quickly.<br>  Good Luck

And then he met Bella and she couldnt see how he liked a mortal more than her.<br>  <br>  <br>  And also Roile would do anything to be mortal again and here was Bella thoughing everything away to be immortal.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope I helped !<br>  <br>  ** Esme Cullen **|`|dR69nySZaa	shes a human dahh!<br>  she can have kids <br>  and most of all rosalie was initially <br>  meant to be a mate for Edward, <br>  and even though shes with Emmett<br>  shes so vein that she finds edwards attraction<br>  to Bella wrong<br>  and doesnt understand why Edward<br>  thinks Bella is more attractive than she is. <br>  <br>  and Rosalie didnt have a choice to become <br>  a vampire, where bella does.|`|cgz85foTaa	Bella and Edward being together is what caused the other vampires to be after them.  The Cullen family's secret might become exposed if Bella stays with Edward, so Rosalie is pissed because her family is in trouble.|`|zGFiWSPtaa	Rosalie is jealous of bella's mortalness and her choice to become a vampire.

Not that she was attracted to Edward but she was just mad over that fact. Also shes jealous that Bella is human. She would kill to be human again and shes also mean to Bella because she is mad that Bella wants to become vampire. Rose thinks vampires are torture and she doesn't know why Bella wants to be a monster.<br>  <br>  Yes so basically thats why Rose doesn't like Bella. :]|`|NH0rB0twaa	because rosalie and edward used<br>  to either be together or something<br>  like that.|`|QMYNDtHgaa	Guys who read the book notice Bella isn't a character at all, rather an invisible fabric every girl wears so they can pretend they are Bella.  This is why Bella has no personality or motivations or..well..life. <br>  <br>  Guys hate this and cant stand how horrible and lame it is that everyone reads it but ah HA enter Rosalie, Rosalie hates Bella and the male readers finally have someone they can root and cheer for.|`|m8VVCrKkaa	she doesn't hate her. In the 3rd book Rosalie explains how she lost everything she wanted the night she became a vampire, and she wishes that Bella wouldn't choose this path. What Rosalie had wanted was to be married and have a couple pretty kids. Bella still had that chance to be with Edward even if she wasn't a vampire.|`|EOwxpAD6aa	Rosalie dislikes Bella at the beginning because Rosalie wants what Bella has. Which is mortality.

HKGHeZguaa	First of all, not to be mean or anything, but the first one looks like an amateur photo which is probably what it is which is fine. I like the window and I like the model and the curtains. I have a technique that I use all the time and it seems to work very well for me. I like to have my subjects with insecure body language or insecure facial expressions. I'll describe this the best I can but it will be hard. Maybe you should try that same situation with everything the same. Try to have the model wrap the right side of the curtain around her and tilt her head slightly down. Don't let her smile even though that sounds kind of funny. The second one is good and professional...not much to say there. Good luck and if you want any more help email me.|`|kkJp175zaa	Well, they are different.

It may or may not also improve image quality depending on how the resolution adjustment is made in-camera.<br>  Since this camera does not produce RAW images it makes sense to shoot in a resolution that fits your intended use. Plus there is the possibility of a better signal to noise ratio in the lower resolutions.|`|AA12339318	The BEST setting would tend to be the highest.  The more pixels in the image, the more detail is captured.<br>  <br>  Why would you NOT want the highest quality image at whatever size printed?|`|AA10070469	I believe that you should use what you paid for. Shot for prints at the max of your camera.If its a 8 mp camera shoot at 8mp. The reason is go for the best quality. You can always lower the mega pixel if you want to say make it easier to e-mail a photo to someone, but you cant raise the mp after it is taken. You paid for the higher mp , use the highest mp.

D3rUImGQaa	I read Twilight in October of 2005 when it first came out ( I was only 13) and I was like "woah! That's the best book i ever read!" I asked almost everybody I knew if they had read it and they said no they've never heard of it. Also, while I was reading it, everybody was commenting on how geeky of me that I should be reading something like that (when they hadn't a clue what it was about) Then in 2008 everybody I see has one of the Twilight saga books in their hands or has a shirt or something. It's kind of annoying but I don't really care. It isn't that big of a deal. I still like Twilight (just for old times sake) but not as much as before since now it is soooo overrated.|`|BuJClF3Faa	The craze is just as you said, "Crazy", in the real, insane, asylum sense. It is poorly written and the characters might as well be cardboard. <br>  <br>  Pros:<br>  Uh...<br>  Uhm...<br>  You got any? I'm coming up blank.<br>  WAIT! I got one, the humans.<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  Edward<br>  Bella<br>  The Cullens<br>  The Plot (or lack thereof)<br>  The Adjectives<br>  The Adverbs<br>  The general series is pretty much a con of all literature as a whole.|`|2cf99691bb36e8205d594c179df58bdeaa	I read that book before it was HUGE<br>  and I was like<br>  okay ...cute<br>  the way it was written kind of pissed me off - Bella's character -.-' <br>  the main reason for my frustration<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and then BOOM<br>  everyone loves it<br>  obsessed fans where ever I turn<br>  <br>  half those people have a fetish for vampires and actually are crazed fans<br>  the other half are followers|`|AASxKRiAaa	Pros:<br>  <br>  Popular. <br>  Everyone loves it.<br>  It has a "hot, perfect and awesome" main character. <br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  It has a terrible plot<br>  It is terribly written<br>  It has WAY too many adjectives<br>  Its characters are too perfect<br>  It has way too much sexual innuendo in the last book. <br>  <br>  My opinion of it:<br>  The above and I hate it immensely.|`|J3H3C5ksaa	I'm just going to get a LOT  of thumbs down by fans, but here;<br>  <br>  As a teen girl, the stereotypical Twilight reader, right? Wrong. I admit, I fell in love with the series, then, I don't know. I guess you could say I became wiser, smarter, more intellectual. I completely hated it, everything Bella did soon pissed me off, and Edward wasn't some hot, perfect vampire-oh, no. He was suddenly this abusive, possessive, controlling boyfriend. <br>  <br>  Is that honestly the best message, Stephenie Meyer can tell us? It's okay to have controlling boyfriends-that is, if they sparkle and are hot.<br>  It's okay to get married when your 18, and it's totally fine to have a baby when you're 19. It's just completely going to destroy your life, but, hey, if Meyer says it's okay...<br>  <br>  Pros: Alice Cullen. <br>  Cons: You don't want me to go on.<br>  <br>  I don't know how others see Bella as a role-model, when I perceive her as whiny, ungrateful and just flat out personality deprived. Meyer basically is telling us when we get a boyfriend, we should sneak him into our rooms, and ignore our friends. And when he dumps us, we should so totally not get on with life. Oh, and to keep trying to have sex with him.<br>  <br>  You know what? Edward Cullen isn't real. I'm going to get swarmed by crazed girls screaming "NO! I LOVE HIM! AND HE'S MINE!" or "THE ACTOR IS!" Do you honestly think he's going to pay attention to YOU?<br>  Plus, his hair's messed up.<br>  <br>  Rock on Anti-Twilighters.<br>  <br>  P.S. Can Meyer use some adjectives besides; white marble skin, and liquid topaz eyes?|`|NlvTdPvRaa	What's Twilight?|`|HSIi8qOWaa	In general, I'm not really interested in mass-produced grocery store fiction. It lacks depth and ultimately is a waste of time. What do you learn about life when you're reading books about Vampires running around? Not to say that all fiction with fantastical elements are shallow. Like the genre of magical realism. Books with fantastical elements such as 100 Years of Solitude are inducted into the literary canon for a reason. The twilight series, ultimately, will be forgotten a hundred years from now when historians are trying to learn about us. The only place it would come up is in an obscure college course about American culture (along with Harry Potter). People who study literature are going to be more interested in works by people like Paolo Coelho, and Maya Angelou than Stephen King and Ann Rice. If you want a REALLY good book that's relatable to teenagers, and is also very entertaining, read The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys. I guarantee this book will show up in literature classes everywhere soon, if it hasn't been taught already. Although it is canon-quality, it is an amazing book that even the most reluctant readers will not be able to put down.|`|RrtUV5wcaa	i think the really over obsessed fans are the ones that are annoying, not necessarily the books (the books are pretty good, i like them). and it's become really overrated as well. i mean, the books are good, but people are trying to make it seem wayyy better than it really is. the first time i read it, i fell in love with it, but after re reading it a few times i really noticed a lot of flaws, like that the writing is really basic in a lot of parts, there's too many plot holes, the characters are one-dimensional, and stephenie meyer writes like she swallowed a thesaurus. i'm not trying to bash it, but i don't think its as big a deal or as great as some of the freak fans make it seem. so though i enjoyed the series, they're really over doing it, and there's plenty of better books out there. and soon, no one is gonna remeber twilight because soon enough a new fad is going to come along to take it's place.|`|z8s6xNLCaa	I think it has some good things to it. I mean, people that don't normally read are reading and enjoying it which is good. Teachers are getting their students to get interested in reading by referring this book which is also good. The bad thing is... at my school it is defiantly a fad. Kids are starting to read it just to fit in. Girls are starting to buy Twilight merchandise and wear it and girls feel the need to wear it too. I'm glad that people are getting into reading but this book is really nothing special it has a mediocre plot and monotone characters so I don't know why people are so into it!<br>  <br>  That's my opinion.|`|fmhAjr3Taa	I am one of the Twilight haters so here is the con's of Twilight<br>  -The plot is horrible<br>  -Everyone does not read the good vampire books because people think it's going to be boring and copy of Twilight<br>  -Everything turns out all right in the last book<br>  -Everything is to perfect|`|QMYNDtHgaa	I think its a small fad but the people that like it are very Loud and very very repetitive.  It's not like other fads where you went out side and were surrounded by it everywhere.  I mean I can think of so many more fads more over bearing then this, only those fads have fans with personal space respect.|`|uD7giDNjaa	I don't like it.<br>  <br>  I was a Twilight fan wayy before any of this.<br>  <br>  I first read it in 2007. Back then, you would be like,<br>  "Have you read Twilight?"<br>  and then People would just be like<br>  "What the hell is Twilight?"<br>  <br>  <br>  Those were the days.<br>  Same thing happened with Harry Potter.|`|340b26ce43c6883db27fb3eadcc14abaaa	It's terrible.

Kwg7jrTDaa	In a field like Graphic Design most employers don't care if you went to Harvard (not that they offer this degree) or barely made it out of high school, but what they do care about is what you can do. If you were a talented artist with an eye for design before you went to school, it wouldn't matter if you got a Bachelor's or not.<br>  My personal recommendation (I'm a web developer) would be to go down the web design path. Talented UI (user interface) developers are always in high demand.<br>  <br>  Here is what I recommend you learn:<br>  XHTML/CSS<br>  Javascript<br>  Flash/Actionscript<br>  Flex<br>  <br>  (maybe something like php - just enough to get around)<br>  That combination can easily land you a job paying in the mid $50's and above (people in my office make that and way more - I've seen job postings with 6 figure salaries). The important thing here is talent. You have to be very good at at least 2 of those things listed.<br>  <br>  In lieu of spending thousands of dollars and years more in school, you can spend about $1 - $5000 more on some books, training (lynda.com is awesome!!!!), maybe some other technical training (e.g phparch.com - but this would be later down).<br>  <br>  My first recommendation would be a book called:<br>   "Head First XHTML & CSS". <br>  It is probably one of the best starter books on XHTML/CSS. <br>  After that you can then move to lynda.com and browse through the CSS/HTML titles to see if you missed anything.<br>  <br>  Then you can move on to Javascript - this will get your feet wet, very wet, then maybe a more advanced book.<br>  <br>  Same goes for all others listed above. <br>  If you dedicate a solid year (and I mean DEDICATE), there's nothing stopping you from having a solid career in this field.<br>  <br>  It took me 1.6 years to go from $0 (literally) to $60,000 per year in web development.<br>  <br>  While you are learning, you can also check out freelance sites like guru.com (better of the sites), getafreelancer.com (not so good) where you can start bidding on small design projects. To start you'd probably have to work on low budget stuff, but as you get more experience, more positive reviews, you will earn more and more. <br>  <br>  If you can, contact me to discuss more.<br>  <br>  I didn't graduate college myself and earn well over $70,000 per year. Because of what I know, I'd take the Pepsi challenge with any college grad, even with a Master's degree! (or PhD!!!) because what I know is not taught in schools - and any employer who knows anything will judge based on your merit not on how long you sat in a classroom .|`|AA12339318	The peopls who told you there isn't difference in the degrees are NOT those in the field.  I don't KNOW these people, but I'd be willing to bet on it.<br>  <br>  In the first place, the field is EXTREMELY competitive.  Especially at the high paying end.  There are, simply, a LOT more people who want to get into the field than there are real jobs.  Pretty simple, and pretty daunting for anyone considering actually pursuing a career in the arts.<br>  <br>  What happens is, especially in this slow economy, and even before, that studios, publishers and agencies that actually hire designers can afford to be very, very picky.  If only ONE position opens up, they are likely to get dozens, if not hundreds of applications.  Trust me, they are NOT going to take the time to read through each and every one of those apps and resumes.  One of the easiest screens they can do is to simply throw out and eliminate those without the higher degrees.  No BA or MFA?  Out it goes.  With these degrees, the potential employer can be assured that the candidate has, at least, been exposed to knowledge and tools used in the industry, plus, will have had, at least, four years of experience in projects, internships, freelance work and more.  Plus, they will have been exposed to multiple disciplines and art history and all the other subjects that make a graduate knowledgable and worldly.  They are not going to want "ivory tower" artists.  They are going to want people who know the ins and outs of the culture they will be representing in their work.<br>  <br>  What I often tell people who ask about the need for a degree to "get into" graphic arts, is that, the degree may help get you the interview.  THEN, you get a chance to show your portfolio to land the job.<br>  <br>  A.A. holders end up starting in print and copy shops, doing everything from working the counter, running copies and enlargements, schlepping jobs to and from clients, and, occasionally, actually designing a business card, flyer, or "Grand Opening" banner.  All this for not much more than minimum wage.  The B.A. or M.F.A gets to do billboards, magazine layouts, ad campaigns and other work that pulls down better salaries.<br>  <br>  So, my recommendation is, since you won't be able to complete your four or five years, right now, Get the AA, move with your hubby and think about finishing off your degree online, or at a later time.  The AS doesn't  hurt you, but just don't expext a brilliant and successful career in those first few years.<br>  <br>  By the way, until you get yourself established in someone's studio or agency, you shouldn't expect the privilidge of "telecommuting" you job from home.  The only way to do that is for you to do freelance work.  And THAT means that your primary function will be SALES.  You have to SELL your service before you can be artistically creative.  Unlike in a studio or agency, you don't get paid unless you produce your OWN clients.|`|HSIi8qOWaa	I am telling you this now: An Associate's Degree does NOTHING in the career world. As a matter of fact, Bachelor's degrees are so common now, that many people are asking for employees with master's degrees. Do yourself a huge favor and finish school. In these tough economic times, you need to make sure that you have worth. What denotes that worth in the career world is your degree. I know it's easier just to get the AS, but you won't be doing yourself any favors.

3XNUUfFyaa	Yes you may, the oil pastels if you add oil to them will behave like oil and will take as long to dry. But if you use them and just draw with them it will be no problem. Many artists build their paintings like that. When they are done with their paintings they ad another dimension to their work by drawing with oil pastels or paintsticks.|`|U3brmiC1aa	yes of course, but oil colour must be dry. not wet.|`|ymAz2LnOaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Usually you should use oil painting sticks, but I guess it won't be a problem.<br>  If the juri will aprove or not, that will be another issue- you may have to present it as a mixed media work (if there are categories for each medium).<br>  Now, what you shoud never do it to use oil pastels under oil paints, since oil pastels never dry (at least the regular ones), I'm not sure about the water based ones.<br>  One more thing, usually a water based medium should not be used over an oil based one.

2TLXfQKDaa	Do a cross sectional of something. This can be done entirely in clay or and you can really do anything of what you want to do.<br>  <br>  Do something like, "The Layers of Earth"   Start with the earths core, the mantle and then the crust.  Next the 4 layers of the atmosphere.  Each layer could be made of cake, and you can show in each layer a little bit of what's in it.<br>  <br>  or.  You can do a cross section of a human head.  Cross sections would allow you to easily combine an art project with a scientific one.<br>  <br>  Heck you could even do a cross section of an insect, like a Praying Mantis, I'd like that one :D

They used to use natural minerals and now a lot of chemicals. The Roman color Royal Purple was made from snail shells. It was very rare and expensive, hence royal, because onlt the rich could afford it. It was made in Tyre. Red was made from beetles wing casings (cochineal) yellows and browns from ochre (decayed iron deposits) The film Girl with a Pearl Earring shows how Vermeer made his paints. See William Hyde Perkin and the invention of mauve dye|`|5s3uFazlaa	I love art, so I would definantly do art before science in my opinion.  if it is like an art show, make a really cool collage of things that describe you.  Use Google.com to get ideas for art projects.  Another idea is to make your own version of one of your favorite artist's art.  For example, I like Andy Warhol.  If i were to remake one of his paintings, I would make some kind of pop art picture or paint a Campbell's soup can, like some of his.  The possibilities are endless in art!!  Hope you enter and show everyone how great you are...remember, you can't mess up at art, because art is what you think, not how others expect something to look.

Ow3O7h4caa	Hi<br>  <br>  You can't buy copyrights but you can pay a due if you are making maoney off of it. Usually, the booking agent takes care of that and pays the ASCAP the dues for using them and they distribute the money to the right person.<br>  <br>  I doublt that the composer is interested in selling their copyrights.<br>  <br>  Edit....copyrights can be purchased if you are willing to pay the asking price. As for the right of use, the place you are performing in has these forms to fill out. You pay them a small fee and you ask for a receipt for income tax purposes.<br>  The club or wherever you are performing, sends this to ASCAP and they distribute the money among the rightful copyright owners.<br>  When I toured, half the time, we never paid anything but that depends on the owner of the premises.|`|dd2df7fc5cba9f11d754885dd4f51a59aa	You must contact the holder of the copyrights for each song.

Traditionally it was used to make rough cloth and ropes- wich made it very prized among sailors (making of sails and ropes for sailing ships). My guess is that all the nations which sent out colonists made sure they had some hemp seeds with them- along with wheat and other such.

Instead, to catch his attention, I would make some kind of picture with things in it that he enjoys or likes.  if you are already in a relationship with him, and you want this to be a gift, I would give him something that reflects you and him.  since you are not an artist, like you said, don;t try to do something that you can't do.  It won't come out right...your best bet would be to do something that you are good at some it will turn out amazing and reflect the your true self.

He was a democrat (understand, the political parties were rather different from how they are now), a northerner with southern sympathies.  He did not think it was legal for the southern states to secede from the union, but he did not think it was legal to go to war to stop them.  He basically did nothing while the situation deteriorated to the point where civil war became inevitable.  <br>  His political views?  Do as little as possible, I guess.

But she was half human half vampire.. so the volturi came then Bella and all of the other vampires came and helped convince the volturi about reneesme and then Alice comes and she found an immortal person half human half vampire and proved the volturi that reneesme isn't immortal .. and then they leave .. and everything is Happily Ever After!!

It's like love but it goes from fatherly to brotherly to eventually adult love. The Volturi here of the "immortal child" which is illegal and come to prosecute the law breakers. Eventually the Cullens have enough back up and evidence to prove that the child is half human half vampire and therefore not illegal. Bella's "super power" turns out to be her ability to block others out. No one who messes with the mind can hurt her and she soon learns to protect others with her "shield". She also has insane self control so she doesn't crazily attack any human she comes close to like normal newborns. This allows her to interact with her father, daughter, and other humans.

This is called PARALLELISM:<br>  <br>  "Say not the struggle nought availeth" and "The enemy faints not nor faileth"<br>  <br>  Where this repetition shows contrasting ideas such as "availeth" / "faileth", "breaking / making".......this is called ANTITHESIS.<br>  <br>  The whole poem presents pairs of ideas throughout, and that's what gives it its structure.<br>  <br>  The contrasting line is surely the last one. The poem began with an imperative, "Say", and then a long description of things that are unstoppable and overwhelming in their relentlessness and magnitude.<br>  <br>  But in the final line another imperative comes, "Look!" that doesn't need an explanation to follow. Because it highlights a positive idea it almost seems more important by being left to stand alone.<br>  <br>  Also - in the final line we are told "the land is bright" - this changes the structure of the rest of the poem because now this something BEING, not HAPPENING - "is" rather than "comes" or "chase".

Not and Nought: it is basically saying, do not say that our struggles do not gain us any success.  <br>  <br>  The line that it contrasts with, on a structural level, is the last one in that stanza: "and as things have been, things remain," which basically confirms, or modifies what was being demanded to not be said.  It could also possibly be the line, "if hopes were dupes, fears may be liars."  This contrasts in a way because it is an aggressive attack on the claim that struggles are in vain, as opposed to a defensive demand that the claim of vain struggles not be made.<br>  <br>  But that's not contextual, as the first two stanzas are basically one long thought.<br>  <br>  I would say the first line contrasts with the last one, "but westward, look! the land is bright."

o40QqoQGaa	Well, New Moon ends with Edward going to the Volturi to have them kill him, because he thinks Bella killed herself after they broke up, and he couldnt live with the thought of that, so he wanted to kill himself. But Bella did not kill herself, Alice just did not see the entire Vision. So, when Alice comes back to Forks to help Charlie with the funeral, and Bella comes walking in the door, she freaks out, and Bella run to Volterra, Italy where Edward was planning to do something to get himself killed by the volturi. Barely making it in time to stop Edward from doing it, they are put up for vote by the volturi on whether to let Bella go, because she knows about the Vampire world, and knows too much, so the Volturi want to kill Bella, which will make Edward fight for her, and he will be Killed, and Alice will step in to help fight for the cullens, and it would be a chain reaction all the way through the cullen family. But since there is a goo enough connection between Carlisle, and Aro (head volturi leader) he gives them a warning, and says that they are coming back to check and make sure they transformed Bella into a vampire within a certain amount of time, or they are going to come and kill them all. lol IT WAS SUCH A GOOD ENDING! <br>  <br>  There is a sequel to this book, its called Eclipse, and after that book, there is a fourth Book called Breaking Dawn, and Stephenie is even writing a 5th book called Midnight Sun, which is twilight written through Edwards perspective, rather than Bellas.|`|BuJClF3Faa	Bella and Alice go to Italy to save Edward, because he's committing suicide. They talk their way out of the situation with the Volturri. No one dies.<br>  <br>  There is no prediction to be made about the main character, because she doesn't change. The sequel... I can't predict it without giving it away.

VMVW3E7Aaa	People so often ask: "Which one is a good camera to buy?"<br>  Here is my 10 cents on the subject:<br>  <br>  Point & Shoot cameras are wonderfully handy because of their small size.<br>  When light conditions are ideal, they even take really nice photos - all of them do.<br>  <br>  However, they all DO have limitations - they don't do very well in low light situations  (i.e. noisy photos, hard to avoid blur, etc). The little onboard flash is very harsh at close range, and doesn't reach very far.<br>  Many of them have no manual functions, so you are limited to only very basic photos, you can't compensate for unusual situations, or do many fun "tricks" and special effects.<br>  P&S's  also suffer from  frustrating shutterlag and many of them chew through batteries rather quickly.<br>  <br>  However, if you're ok with all those limitations, then go ahead and pick one, most of them (the same type and same price range) are rather similar. Personally I would pick either a Canon or a Nikon, and would certainly stay away from Kodak. <br>  <br>  A higher end P&S will give you more manual options and better quality.  Many of those even give you the option of adding a proper flash (which makes a big difference to your flash photos).<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about megapixels…. there is a limit to how many pixels you can squash into a tiny P&S sensor before you actually LOSE quality rather than gain it.<br>  Don't worry about digital zoom, in fact, don't EVER use it. It simply crops away pixels, i.e. destroys information. The only real zoom is optical.<br>  <br>  Decide which features are important to you, and look for cameras that have that feature. <br>  Then go compare a few models on www.dpreview.com  .  <br>  <br>  The very best thing you can do for your success is to borrow some books and learn about  photography.  A bit of knowledge will make a much bigger difference to your photos than your choice of P&S camera can.<br>  <br>  For what it's worth - if I was in the market for a P&S camera right now, my choice would be a Canon Powershot  SX10 IS <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=144&modelid=17630" rel="nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...</a><br>  <br>  P.S. forget about your rule #5 - no camera can handle being shaken without blurring the photo.|`|HKGHeZguaa	The Nikon Coolpix P80 I believe will satisfy your needs and met all of your wants and needs. It has an 18x optical zoom with Image Stabilization!! It takes macro photos and is rated well by Consumer Reports. If you have any more questions feel free to email me.

All vampires are strong. He just has a bit more magnification of it. If a vampire doesn't have a power, they usually bring something forth in their vampire life. For Roaslie she brought forth her pigheadedness(I think that's what Edward calls it), which is stubborness. As with Carlisle brought compassion. And Esme brought love, especially for her "children".|`|QMYNDtHgaa	Didn't this just get posted?  <br>  No, no she doesn't. <br>  it's another plot hole that they all talk about how each vampire is unique and has a special ability but Roasalie doesn't, as well as any other side vampire characters smeyers couldn't be bother to write about.|`|cvTzLEoBaa	Well, it's not really a power.<br>  But she is amazingly hot, and she can get any guys she wants.<br>  Even to use them.<br>  That's sorta a power in a way.|`|ugq1Dgsuaa	Edward says that her power is "Her tenacity, or you could call it pigheadedness."

rT22hTL0aa	I was waiting to see if someone with more guitar experience might answer your question, but it doesn't look like anybody is.  It is likely that you have heavy gauge strings on it to make the dropped B tuning work (so they may be too heavy for playing in standard) and you may need to change to a lighter gauge string.   You also may need set up changes to the action (with the truss rod) as it was probably changed to accommodate the Drop B tuning.  Read the link below for more advice on dealing Dropped B.  I'm afraid that's all the help I can offer.

Do you still feel the same? <br>  <br>  The funny thing about that statement is I didn't actually write the majority of it. I wrote about three single-spaced Word document pages of just real pain — with sort of a laugh on the end so everything was kind of tongue-in-cheek. And there were lawyerly people who thought it just wasn't a good way to do it. I didn't want to feel misrepresented in the letter and other people didn't want me to be too emotionally vulnerable. So in the end only the one or two sentences written by me seem really jarring, and people didn't get that there was sort of a joke in there. For example the part that's me is where I said, ''If I wrote it now everybody would end up dying.'' But that was a joke! And it sounded so serious amidst all the lawyer talk and I think my fans thought, Wow, she's threatening to kill everyone! [Laughing] I felt kind of bad about that. I never felt any anger, actually. Just a lot of sadness. I mean it was a sucker punch — like someone came up behind you and just hammered you in the kidneys and you had no idea it was coming.|`|BuJClF3Faa	No. Please no.

TbTO5SXlaa	From reading the specifications for your camera it doesn't have a Manual Mode. Your shutter has a minimum of 1 sec. and a maximum of 1/2000 sec. Your ISO range is from 80 to 1000. The lens on your camera is a 6.3-18.9mm (36-108mm 35mm equivalent) with a maximum aperture (f-stop) of 3.1 at 6.3mm and 5.9 at 18.9mm. <br>  <br>  Don't dispair. Although you can't take real long exposures there are some night pictures without flash that are within the capabilities of your camera. You will need either a tripod or a really firm support. You cannot hand-hold the camera. Use the camera's self-timer to release the shutter.<br>  <br>  Suppose you want to photograph a floodlit building or fountain. By using ISO 400 and f5.6 your exposure will be 1/2 sec. If you want better image quality, lower the ISO to 200 and make a 1 sec. exposure at f5.6.<br>  <br>  You say you'd like a picture of the city skyline in the distance? Perhaps across a river? You can do it. You'll have to use your lens at its wide setting of 6.3mm so you can use f3.1. Using ISO 400 a 1 sec. exposure should give you a useable image. If it doesn't, try ISO 800 at about 3/4 sec. (Unfortunately, I have no charts or tables showing a relationship between f31. and f2.8. I have tables showing 1/3 stop and 1/2 stop increments). The lower you can keep your ISO the better. 800 should be a last resort. <br>  <br>  The times I've used may be off. At least you have some idea of a starting point. <br>  <br>  I referred to my FotoSharp ( <a href="http://www.fotosharp.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fotosharp.com/</a> ) Day & Night Exposure Guide. It uses full stops - 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6 - so the 1 sec. at f3.1 with ISO 400 and 3/4 sec. at f3.1 with ISO 800 are my best educated guesses.|`|2TLXfQKDaa	With many point and shoot cameras you can also take slower than instant exposures as well.  Turn your film speed down to 100 or lower ISO, this alone will slow your shot down.  You're not going to take a 30 sec exposure this way, but you can get it around a few secs or so.  My sony point and shoot with a few settings can take about 30sec exposures.  Your night setting might do this for you, set it to the mode and turn your iso down, this will buy you quite a bit of time, probably about as much as you'll get out of your camera.<br>  <br>  Investing in a lower end dslr will make this very easy, but for a point and shoot you're very limited.|`|0LgpcOBDaa	Your camera has to have a B setting somewhere, or you need to get  a camera that has the full range of manual over rides in it.<br>  <br>  Your camera would good if it had a place for a cable release too.<br>  <br>  I don't know your camera, you should look at your owners book and read the parts on shutter speeds and exposures. I bet the book has a lot of info in it about your camera.<br>  <br>  Do you have a M setting..? This may be a start..<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Bob - Tucson|`|HKGHeZguaa	You need to have to have a shutter speed setting. You will be able to do this with any DSLR and maybe higher end point and shoot cameras. Since this is a low end point and shoot camera you probably won't be able to do this. If you're thinking of upgrading then look into the Nikon Coolpix P60. Also if you want a DSLR then look into the 6mp D40. If you have any interest in buying one of these cameras email me at chis01919@gmail.com .

sjMIFH9Faa	Consider the fact that over 70% of the population of Mexico is of Native American blood and less than 1% of the United State population is of Native American Blood. Who do you think was more brutal? <br>  <br>  The fact is that much of our historic tradition comes from English and American historians which are traditional enemies of Spain. In reality, Spain has a bad legacy which isn't really deserved. All colonization is brutal, but the Spanish did give some advantages to natives that other cultures didn't. The English, for example, either entirely killed the native population or forced the to move, the Spanish did no such thing. They even allowed marriage between Native and Spaniard, the English forbid it. <br>  <br>  Really, English and American historians till the 20th century were pretty negative towards the Spanish and other Catholic cultures. Modern scholarship is slowly beginning to show that the Spanish we unfairly judged by the historical record.  The Black Legend isn't really true, its almost entirely exaggerated.|`|Gmvldblraa	You want brutality ?

There are not many stories / historical references showing any attempts of the Spanish to better the status of the native.

The lands they conquered were not overseas- so this allows them to pretend they are not "colonies" (as if the ability to build a ship made the difference)<br>  <br>  In case of Russia- guess where are the Siberian tribes. Look up the Famine (Holodomor) in Ukraine (another ex-colony)- the deliberate starving to death of over 5 milion people. And the last train load of deportees to Siberia went from Poland in 1958. Ald also look up Chetchenya- another little colonial war...<br>  <br>  China- Tibet and the Ujgurs for starters. Though the "Han" Chinese are not treated much better

mzNLfY4Caa	Two famous artist who did pop art were Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. The style was very popular during the 1950's that is pretty much when it started to emerge. Pop art was generally based on isolating a subject and contrasting different colors creating a "pop" look. You can see many icons or symbols with this type of art.<br>  <br>  You could take some fun facts from Wikipedia. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_art" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_art</a>|`|oHO0XOQVaa	Pop art focuses on familiar images of popular culture. At the time of its conception, it was about mass producing them just as everything else was starting to be mass produced. It was about embracing popular culture and mass production. It was done through collages (of mass produced images such as those in a magazine), comics, lithographs, etc.<br>  <br>  From wikipedia: "Pop art challenged tradition by asserting that an artist's use of the mass-produced visual commodities of popular culture is contiguous with the perspective of Fine Art since Pop removes the material from its context and isolates the object, or combines it with other objects, for contemplation...Characterized by themes and techniques drawn from popular mass culture, such as advertising, comic books and mundane cultural objects....aimed to employ images of popular as opposed to elitist culture in art, emphasizing the banal or kitschy elements of any given culture, most often through the use of irony."|`|EyL6Pic3aa	Almost as irrelevant as abstract art.

469ca2d2bcd9b0f6f06c8d756b37b248aa	It's extremely hard to get a first novel published these days.  The good thing is that you already know who your target readers are.  You need to make yourself stand out from the crowd because agents are bombarded daily by new writers.    There are some things you can do first before you begin your search for an agent.    Build a platform.  Agents look for writers who have national or international platforms these days.  One way to do that is to start a website or, better yet, a blog.  Begin to build a fan base even before you seek publication.  If you can show that you attract significant numbers of viewers to your website, that will prove that you can make sales.    Build an email list of people who might want to buy your book  This will prove that you know how to reach your future readers and connect with them.    Get articles and short stories published.  This makes a huge difference.  It shows that you are a serious writer and not a one shot deal.  You need some credits to your name.    Take on some speaking engagements so that you also show that you have something to offer, that you are charismatic and that you connect to people.    Publishers and agents expect an author to do a lot of the legwork in selling their books.  Even the largest publishers expect this these days.    Consider international publishers.  Many of them will accept submissions directly from an author.  You feel your target reaers are foreigners, so this makes sense to seek out international publishers.  Also, many small independent U.S. publishers seek first time novelists and also accept submissions directly from authors.  In fact, they prefer to deal with authors rather than agents because they don't have the profit margins to give the kinds of deals that agents would want to negotiate.  "The Writer's Market" (Writer's Digest Books) is an annually published book that you can probably find at your local library.  It's OK if it's a year or two old and not the latest edition.  It mentions the percentages of unagented material a publisher accepts and buys.  It also lists literary journals and magazines that you might want to submit articles or short stories to.    Many debut novelists sell their first books to small independent publishers.  I'm not talking about self-publishing, but rather small publishers.  After getting that|`|Xc02z608aa	http://www.writersdigest.com  http://www.soyouwanna.com  http://www.absolutewrite.com    Those are some great sites for researching how to get a literary agent.  I am sure that doing a little research will be a snap after writing an entire novel.    Good Luck!!!|`|5ede303e3f09ef934bb1a71e8b13e26aaa	Get hold of the Artists and Writers Yearbook, it lists every agent and publisher, what they specialise in and how to contact them.  You'll have to have a few sample chapters and a synopsis for them to read as well as a good covering letter.  Also be prepared to be rejected quite a few times, even Stephen King got his first 3 novels rejected.  Don't take it personally, it's just that every muppet thinks they can write a book these days so agents are very quick to reject things that don't immediately grab them

lPxVt2XYaa	Marxism-Leninism was an internationalist ideology.  That is it claimed that all working people would, eventually, develop "class consciousness" which would supersede any other allegiances they had - thus forming a non-nationalistic, single, working class, communist system.  Even after the October Revolution many Bolsheviks believed that unless Germany - one of the most industrialised and urbanised countries - became communist, then their revolution was doomed.  Stalin changed this ideology, stating that the Revolution should focus on building on its own success, and help to ferment revolutions in other countries.  This policy was known as "socialism in one country".    Stalin used the Comintern - the Communist International, an organisation of all the communist parties in the World - to help ferment revolutions.  He also used hard diplomacy: Molotov was sent on various diplomatic missions, to the US, to Britain and to Germany, in Britain & the US he became known as Mr Nyet, Mr No.  Stalin called him "stone-a rse" because he wouldn't budge on any decision.    Soviet foreign policy under Stalin was vigorous, and it did promote revolts, riots and even terrorist activities, but it did not help maintain Stalin's rule in the Soviet Union.  His internal policies ensured his, and the system he governed survival.  Stalin was a manipulative, paranoid, intelligent and ruthless man who collected information on all of his colleagues, ready to use it for even the slightest indiscretion.  He encouraged people to inform on each other for speaking ill about him, the communist party, the local soviet or anything that maybe construed as anti-soviet.  This led people to fear speaking out even to their husbands or wives, their children and their work colleagues.    This was what really maintained his power.

d04ae6ff8e12fe20d1db30d24b4bc806aa	Malcolm maintained that the name "Little" was both diminutive and his "Slave name." It was not his real name. It was the name imposed on him by white society, (when slaves achieved freedom, they took the names of their former masters). So Malcolm never knew what his real last name was.    He said that he would carry the name "X" until he died and the voice of Allah gave him a name|`|qDSvOOwBaa	It's in his autobiography with Alex Haley(a fine book) I can't seem to remember the reason he changed it. I do remember a quote of Malcom's(I'm not his biggest fan to say the least) but I have always remember this;" The spirit world is fine but I want our folk to be free in the world of the living"    I always liked that and the spirit of martyrdom is inspiring-I have used it several times.    s_e_s

However, during medieval times, the name John was altered slightly in the Germanic tongues to Jankin or Jackin. Out of that, we get the nickname Jack.|`|AA11570236	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Ken...  try this|`|RVABrMeSaa	His brother Bobby was really Robert and Ted Is Edward.

onkUcy19aa	"The Abundance Book" was written by the visionary John Randolph Price, and he has a new book on CD called the 40 Day Prosperity Plan.     The visionary author of The Abundance Book, brings you a CD program that an change your life...in less than two months! As Price says, "It takes 40 days for consciousness to realize a truth. If the plan outlined in this CD is faithfully followed for 40 days, you consciousness will be changed from a vibration of limitation to one of abundance, as proven by letters from thousands of people around the world."     This is the summary of the Abundance Book as a sort of:  The Statements of Principle: (EDITED VERSION)  1. God is my lavish, unfailing Abundance, the rich omnipresent substance of the Universe. This all-providing Source of infinite prosperity is  the Reality of me.  2. I lift up my mind and heart to be aware, to understand, and to know the Divine Presence I AM is the Source and Substance of all my good.   3. I am conscious of the Inner Presence as my lavish Abundance. I am conscious of the constant activity of this Mind of infinite Prosperity. Therefore, my consciousness is filled with the Light of Truth.  4. Through my consciousness of God, the Christ within, as my Source, I draw into my mind and feeling nature the very substance of Spirit. This substance is my supply, thus my consciousness of the Presence of God within me is my supply.  5. Money is not my supply. No person, place or condition is my supply. My awareness, understanding and knowledge of the all-providing activity of the Divine Mind within me are my supply. Therefore, my supply is unlimited.   6. My inner supply instantly and constantly takes on form and experience according to my needs and desires, and as the Principle of Supply in action, it is impossible for me to have any needs or unfulfilled desires.   7. The Divine Consciousness is forever expressing Abundance. This is its responsibility, not mine. My responsibility is to be aware of this Truth. Therefore, I am totally confident in letting go and letting God appear as the abundant all-sufficiency in my life and affairs.  8. My consciousness of the Spirit within me as my unlimited Source is the Divine Power to restore the years the locusts have eaten, to make all things new, to lift me up to the High Road of abundant prosperity. This awareness, understanding and knowledge of Spirit appear as every visible form and experience that I could possibly desire.   9. When I am aware of the Divine Presence within me as my total fulfillment, I am totally fulfilled. I am now aware of this Truth. I have found the secret of life, and I relax in the knowledge that the Activity of Divine Abundance is eternally operating in my life. I simply have to be aware of the flow, the radiation, of that Creative Energy, which is continuously, easily and effortlessly pouring forth from my Divine Consciousness. I am now aware. I am now in the flow.   10. I keep my mind and thoughts off this world and I place my entire focus on God within as the only Cause of my prosperity. I acknowledge the Inner Presence as the only activity in my financial affairs, as the substance of all things visible. I place my faith in the Principle of Abundance in action within me.     Of course, John Randolph Price could explain this to you more fully. Buy his CD.
AHuBqplbaa	All writers include some of themselves in their books, all writers use other peoples work as motivation and inspiration.  That is normal.  Don't change your idea for the reasons you gave - good stories are not about good ideas, but about ideas done well.    Don't worry about your vocabulary and description either - you just need to stop worrying and start writing because without practice you will never improve.  And don't be afraid to use a dictionary and thesaurus to help you expand your vocabulary.|`|uGCLrAKKaa	I like the plot. :D I guess. That's all I can really say. Sorry.

5ede303e3f09ef934bb1a71e8b13e26aaa	Do you watch the TV show Dexter?  If so, then this sounds a little familier to me.  All this stuff has been done so you really need to start with a good strong plot rather than just this whole, oh look i'm a murderer thing, it's just been done to death.  Also, have you read American Psycho?  It's full of this kind of introspective stuff but does it so much better.  Try starting with a situation rather than a concept and let us see your serial killer in action rather than just telling us what they do|`|7YkO9zmOaa	Ah! I love romance novels.    It's not to bad, your first try? Try to build your character up slowley. If you shock me to much on the first page, you will lose all of your supprises.    Another thing you could do is give your character limits. Fear, anger, and other emotins can be use very effectively here.     As it stands, your character is someone who likes to kill, likes blood, and likes knives. I don't know even know whether your character feels morally right in killing or whether it's a compulsion that is recognised as wrong. Don't write what you see write how the character would think...how does a killer think, what are this killers quirks.    Also what drove your character to kill? Usually this fact is incorparated or somehow included in the subsequint kills.|`|ZEBsp37waa	Seems like your jumping into it too quickly,  try to move your character along, rather than have something that... confronting right at the beginning.  Plot development is just as important as character development in some ways, and it sort of seems like we just read the middle of the story.  Story isn't really my cup of tea, but i assume its going to be someones.  But, that's just what i see.|`|BUUOW92caa	its very interesting, i'd say give a little bit of more info but gradually blend it together. It a nice start but don't spill it all on one page> :P

L5S6rpI7aa	Before Mughal era Delhi Sultanate was established by Kutubuddin Aibak, Last sultan was Ibrahim Lodi. Pathan hero Babar after winning the 1st battle of Panipat in 1526, with Ibrahim lodi founded Mughal empire. But Babar's Mughal empire was mainly confined to Delhi and adjucent areas. It was Akbar who expanded the Mughal empire. In 1556 Akbar defeated Himu in the battle of 2nd Panipat and started expansion of Mughal empire. Babar was the 1st Mughal empire, but the empire spread by Akbar.|`|mjSnBgyxaa	Baber attacked and fought battle with Ibrahim Lodi in 1526. Ibrahim Lodi was defeated in the battle of Panipat and thus Babur founded the Mughal Kingdom. However Babar's son Humayun was defeated by Shershah Suri but Humayun regained the kingdom after the death of Shershah.  Some writers say that Akbar was the real founder of Mughal Kingdom. Akbar (under the guardianship of Bairam Khan) defeated Hemu in the battle of Panipat in 1556  Mughat Kingdom expanded gradually and it reached its zenith (in area) in the reign of Aurangzeb.|`|hIrYMF9qaa	mughal kingdom got established with the end of the rule of last lodi king that was Ibrahim lodi.it was first founded by first Mughal emperor Babur.

HOrFClP9aa	Sight reading DOES improve with experience. But there are other ways to make it sound better when you sight read.<br>  <br>  First look at the key signature and time signature. Make sure you know what fingerings are flat or sharp, if any.<br>  <br>  You'll also want to look at the style its played, and the tempo. If it says legato, it means long and connected. There are other terms which mean different things too.<br>  <br>  Look for any rhythms that look hard to play or weird, and count them out so you know how it sounds. Also look at the articulation.<br>  <br>  These are some ways, I hope, will improve your sight reading. Don't forget to look at the dynamics too :)<br>  <br>  Glad to know there are kids involved in the music department.|`|fQ0cQlWKaa	It does take a LOT of time.<br>  i've been reading sheet music and singing since 4th grade {grade 8 now], violin since 6th and piano since 7th.<br>  <br>  I think youre very advanced. A month and already grade two? amazing.<br>  keep up the good work.<br>  <br>  it does help to know all of the notes on the treble and bass cleff. knowing the fingerings helps as well, makes it easier to play.<br>  I was taught STARS which goes like this:<br>  <br>  S- signature, look at the key signature. Since you've been musically involved for a bit, I wont go into detail.<br>  <br>  T- time signature/tempo, look at how fast the piece is to be played.<br>  <br>  A- accidentals. look for them as well. They can trip a lot of people up. <br>  <br>  R- Rythm, the thing you said was a problem. go through and clap rythms if you need to. Eventually you'll just... get it.<br>  <br>  S- Signs, such as dynamics, repeats, ending, etc.|`|dd2df7fc5cba9f11d754885dd4f51a59aa	It does get easier, yes. Playing in bands and orchestras helps with band/orchestral instruments, and just generally playing as much new music as possible helps with piano.<br>  <br>  Before starting the piece you're sight reading, look through it thoroughly. try out the hard bits, work out the theme. Then take it SLOWLY. Read ahead as far as you can so that you are prepared for the next few notes/bars (and make sure you are as fluent as you can be in reading music). It will all come witn time.|`|yTgTNTGxaa	it does improve with experience<br>  the key is to look at the piece slowly, look for large skips and jumps in the notes<br>  practice slowly<br>  its ok-- you will get better w/ practice|`|AWHVwtIkaa	You're absolutely right, it gets easier the longer you play. <br>  <br>  A term my band director in college uses is sight-remembering. Meaning all the different music you play over the years and such, you come across several different notes/rhythms and instead of having to think it out every time you see it in the music, eventually you should just naturally remember how it goes. It does take a lot of practice though, every time you play a piece for the first time, you're gaining sight reading experience. Give it a few years and you should be very good at it. <br>  <br>  Another example, think of word reading. When you first learned how to read, you'd stumble through words and it'd be pretty difficult. But now if you pick up a book for the first time, you can read it with no trouble at all, because you've learned over the years seeing how letters put together sound. And usually you don't even read the word letter for letter, you just know the word from the first and last letter {search that on google sometime), that's basically the same thing as the sight-remembering concept I mentioned earlier. <br>  <br>  Anyway, keep at it and you'll get better! :)|`|a453180b80923cf1b8a94be3b3cbafb9aa	here's my advice:<br>  you can improve your sight reading by paying more attention to the things great sight readers need to know. <br>  things like: tempo- it's always important to know the tempo of your piece before you play it so just check it out and maybe turn your metronome onto that tempo to get the feel of it first<br>  <br>  key signature- i'm sure you absolutely need to keep a close eye on the key signature because then you'll play the wrong notes, just glance at the key signature when you're about to play and program it into your brain so then you can remember all the sharps and flats when you actually start playing<br>  <br>  rhythms- just look through the piece before starting to play and notice some of the rhythms in that particular piece so you will know how to play them when you get to it. another way to do it is trying to play those rhythms out in your head for a sec and it might help<br>  <br>  dynamics- dynamics are pretty important when sight reading, so take a look at the different dynamics you have in the music and kind of take them all in first<br>  <br>  if you are having trouble with using both hands when playing try this:<br>  - if the piece requires you to play with both hands, play it first with one hand, and then the other at a slow tempo until you can play it fluently with each hand alone<br>  - next try putting them together at a very slow tempo<br>  - once together, practice that for as long as you need to<br>  - after it's really good with both hands together slowly, bump the tempo up a bit every time you can get it and it will improve<br>  <br>  sight reading is something that actually comes with practice and experience. you will get it eventually, and you're not alone. a lot of people have this problem too. i actually had a very hard time with it at the beginning but now i'm so much better. <br>  i hope this helps ( sorry it's sooooo long!) :), but if you're still having trouble talk to your teachers and they can try to help you with it.

If they like the synopsis they will probably ask to see the full copy. If they say no, don't worry, try another place or try them again with a different story.

809fb6c211bb2a7784bb577e1e6c272aaa	It seems to me that your statement is correct for the reasons that you gave.  I can't follow the thinking that identical things are non-existent.  How many different varieties of hydrogen atoms are there?  Isn't one molecule of water the same as all the others?    Gee may be correct on the variations of matter on the sub-atomic level - I assume what he states is correct.  It seems to me, however, if it is carried to a logical end somewhere in the sub-atomic world, to be reductio ad absurdum.    I was using identical in the sense of congruence.  Two physical objects are congruent if they are the same shape and size.    [2nd Add]  OK, Gee is correct when you go down into the sub-atomic level and consider energy as well as matter to establish identity.  I suppose he could argue that two separate cubic meters of empty space are not identical - but I wouldn't understand the argument.      I must agree that congruence is not particularly precise - however the original question was in the "philosophy" category.  Our answers are no doubt overkill.|`|JjRhlOg5aa	think of it at an atomic level. Atoms are sooooooo tiny that no 2 snowflakes can be the same, because  billions of atoms make them up, and no two snowflake can have the same "atomic pattern".|`|cTvP6j7Haa	Gee is totally correct.  No identical anything in nature.  No straight lines, no perfect circles. Nothing in nature, not even water drops, in the sea.

You won't notice the difference, but the whole family did and still does.|`|7e7002b6150c8c3eae2926c9baf2be5daa	Maybe you can get your head around this...    There are no 2 identical ANYTHING in the universe.    Think about it...    [add] There are no identical hydrogen atoms because the quantum level particles of which they are made do not conform to the same laws of physics as the macro-world.  In a sense, its a bit like no 2 people can have exactly the same point of view at the same time.  Therefore, they can never observe a phenomenon exactly the same way.    [2nd add]  I understand your point H, But I have to ask the question, "at what point do you reach diminished return"? At what lever have you 'gone far enough'? It seems to me that a cursory observation such as 'size and shape' is hardly far enough, IMO.
w7USF5wDaa	I totally agree.  There is absolutely no way that you can come up with a story-line that is completely original.  Whatever story you come up with there are probably dozens of stories that are quite similar.  Making a story your own is largely a matter of using your own writing style and combining the elements of the story in original ways.  Even if two people are given the identical story-line and told to write a story or a book of a certain length what those two people end up with will be radically different.<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|PDJJd8oEaa	i agree<br>  <br>  <br>  PEACE:)|`|k4sGfsQKaa	Agree.|`|YEfW3vI0aa	Yes, I agree, it is impossible for a story not to be similar to another story.

Basically, Alex Rider is a teenage spy who has to fight to succeed in his missions, or be killed. <br>  In order, it's Stormbreaker, Point Blank, Skeleton Key, Eagle Strike, Scorpia, Ark Angel, then Snakehead.<br>  Here's the summary of Stormbreaker:<br>  "Alex Rider's world is turned upside down when he discovers that his uncle and guardian has been murdered. The 14-year-old makes one discovery after another until he is sucked into his uncle's undercover world. The Special Operations Division of M16, his uncle's real employer, blackmails the teen into serving England. After two short weeks of training, Alex is equipped with several special toys like a Game Boy with unique cartridges that allow it to scan, fax, and emit smoke bombs. Alex's mission is to complete his uncle's last assignment, to discover the secret that Herod Sayle is hiding behind his generous donation of one of his supercomputers to every school in the country. When Alex enters Sayle's compound in Port Tallon, he discovers a strange world of secrets and villains including Mr. Grin, an ex-circus knife catcher, and Yassen Gregorovich, professional hit man. The novel provides bang after bang as Alex experiences and survives unbelievably dangerous episodes and eventually crashes through the roof of the Science Museum to save the day. Alex is a strong, smart hero. If readers consider luck the ruling factor in his universe, they will love this James Bond-style adventure. With short cliff-hanger chapters and its breathless pace, it is an excellent choice for reluctant readers."<br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Stormbreaker/Anthony-Horowitz/e/9780142406113/?itm=9" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Stormbr...</a><br>  Percy Jackon, a fun creative series about Greek mythology, is also a good choice that many boys like.

The books are : The Recruit,Class A, Maximum Security,The Killing,Divine Madness, Man vs Beast, The Fall, Mad Dogs, The Sleepwalker, The General, Brigands MC and Dark Sun (World Book Day). Here is a sample Chapter:Introduction: What is CHERUB?<br>  <br>  During world war two, French civilians set up a resistance movement to fight against the German forces occupying their country. Many of their most useful operatives were children and teenagers. Some worked as scouts and messengers. Others befriended homesick German soldiers, gathering information that enabled the resistance to sabotage German military operations.       <br>   <br>  A British spy named Charles Henderson worked among these French children for nearly three years. After returning to Britain, he used what he’d learned in France to train twenty British children for work on undercover operations. The codename for his unit was CHERUB.<br>                          <br>  Henderson died in 1946, but the organization he created has thrived. CHERUB now has more than two hundred and fifty agents, all aged seventeen or under. Although there have been many technical advances in intelligence operations since CHERUB was founded, the reason for its existence remains the same: adults never suspect that children are spying on them. <br>  <br>  . <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Basic Training<br>  <br>  <br>  James was due at the Basic Training compound at 5AM. He set an alarm and left it on his bedside table. Worrying about training kept him awake for ages. When he woke it was light. It’s never light at 5AM in November. This was bad. <br>  <br>  The alarm clock was gone. Not set wrong. Not tipped on the floor and the battery dropped out. Someone had crept in while he was asleep and taken it. Kyle warned him they’d play tricks, but James hadn’t expected them to start before he even arrived. <br>  <br>  Clothes and a backpack had been dumped on the floor. There were two differences from standard CHERUB kit. The t-shirt and trousers had white number sevens on them. Second, instead of being fabric conditioned and pressed, everything was wrecked. Big stains, rips in the trousers. The underwear was disgusting and the boots had done hard time on somebody else’s feet. James moved the backpack. There was tons of equipment in it. He probably should have got up early and looked at everything.<br>  <br>  James had to wear the wrecked t-shirt and trousers because they had numbers. But he had his own pristine underwear, and boots that were broken in and only smelled of his own feet. Would he get punished for not wearing the clothes on the floor? Or would he get laughed at for being the only one dumb enough to put on second hand underwear? The state of the boxer shorts made his mind up. He was wearing his own stuff. <br>  <br>  There was no time for teeth, comb, or shower. He ran out with the backpack. The lift took ages, like it always does when you’re in a rush. There were two older kids in the lift. They knew where James was going from the numbers on his uniform. <br>  <br>  One of the kids looked at his watch.<br>  <br>              ‘You starting basic training this morning?’ the kid asked.<br>  <br>              ‘Yeah,’ James said.<br>  <br>              ‘It’s half past seven,’ the kid said.<br>  <br>              ‘I know,’ James said. ‘I’m late.’<br>  <br>              The kids burst out laughing. <br>  <br>              ‘You’re not late. You’re dead.’<br>  <br>              ‘So dead,’ the other kid said, shaking his head.<br>  <br>  _<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The training building was a concrete box in the middle of a huge muddy enclosure, with no windows and no heating. Five metre high fences separated it from the rest of campus. Just the look of the place scared James. <br>  <br>  He ran inside, puffed from running. The room had ten rusty beds with wretched looking mattresses. Three girls and four boys were in front of the beds, crouching on the balls of their feet with hands on heads. After about ten minutes in that position the bottom of your legs goes dead. Six of the seven had been that way for two and a half hours, waiting for James. The odd one out had done an hour.<br>  <br>              The head instructor, Mr Large, and his two assistants stood up and walked towards James. Large’s white CHERUB t-shirt was the biggest size you could get, but it still looked like all the muscles inside wanted to burst out. He had buzz cut hair and a bushy moustache. <br>  <br>  James flinched when Large reached out and delicately shook his hand. <br>  <br>              ‘Good morning, James,’ Large said in a soft voice. ‘Smashing of you to pop in. Nice breakfast, was it? Put your feet up, did you? Good read of the papers? No need to worry, James. I didn’t want to start without you, so I made all your new friends wait in a highly uncomfortable position until you arrived. Should I let them stand up now?’<br>  <br>              ‘Yes,’ James said weakly.<br>  <br>              ‘OK, kiddies,’ Large said. ‘Up you get. James, why don’t you shake all of their hands as a little thank you for waiting.’<br>  <br>              The kids stood up, g
AA10725882	Maps can be very helpful in history.<br>  Here's a view of the Spanish empire controlled by Philip II in 1588.<br>  <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~wggerman/map/images/phillipiiempire.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~wggerm...</a><br>  Note that Southern Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia were all controlled by Spain.<br>  It is very likely that Italian ships - especially from the kingdom of Naples - sailed with Italian men on board as part of the Spanish armada.  Dutch ships and sailors were in the Armada since the Netherlands were also controlled by the Spanish king.<br>  <br>  Added note - Peter Kemp in his 1988 "The Campaign of the Spanish Armada" notes that four galleasses from Naples were part of the armada, and that these were the largest ships in either side.  They would certainly have been manned by Italian sailors.|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	Quite possible. At the time of the Armada Spain was a superpower in the Mediteranean and controlled Sardinia and southern Italy- so your ancestor may have been "Spanish" (just like the Dutch were at that time). <br>  He might also have been hired for the expedition- many experienced men were needed and many men were hired- either to fight as mercenaries or as expert sailors to serve and command the ships|`|sjMIFH9Faa	A really difficult question to answer. Without a doubt a vast vast vast majority of sailors with the Spanish Armada were Spanish. I have never heard or read about Italians with the Spanish Armada, however throughout that period mercenaries were a basic part of armies. The Italians had a mercenary group called the Condottieri and they were used all the time. <br>  <br>  I won't say your grandmother is wrong, her story is reasonable, however it is just as likely that a Spaniard changed his name to a more Italian one after moving to England. It is possible that its a name that is common in both Spanish and Italian culture. Bottom line is I doubt their is any real way to prove your lineage one way or another, so just tell the story you like better.

g1dUcKyiaa	The Lost Generation is a term used to describe a group of American writers who were rebelling against what America had become by the 1900’s. At this point in time, America had become a great place to, “go into some area of business." However, the Lost Generation writers felt that America was not such a success story because the country was devoid of a cosmopolitan culture (a cosmopolitan culture is one which includes and values a variety of backgrounds and cultures). Their solution to this issue was to pack up their bags and travel to Europe’s cosmopolitan cultures, such as Paris and London. Here they expected to find literary freedom and a cosmopolitan way of life. <br>  <br>  In the 1920's the White Anglo Saxon Protestant work ethic was the only culture that was considered valued by the majority of Americans. It was ethics such as this which made the cosmopolitan culture of Paris so alluring.<br>  <br>       American Literature went through a profound change in the post WWI era. Up until this point, American writers were still expected to use the rigid Victorian styles of the 19th Century. The lost generation writers were above, or apart from, American society, not only in geographic terms, but also in their style of writing and subjects they chose to write about. Although they were unhappy with American culture, the writers were instrumental in changing their country's style of writing, from Victorian to modern.

K6KeN7sgaa	It has been classified as torture since the Spanish Inquisition.    It is illegal, immoral, and unacceptable.    Japanese soldiers who had waterboarded American soldiers in World War II were tried and executed by America after the War was over.    The highest-ranking officials in the Pentagon and CIA have said REPEATEDLY that torture does NOT elicit reliable information.  ***************************    "We prosecuted our own soldiers for using it in Vietnam. ... Waterboarding is torture," he had said.    http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/...  **********************************  Under U.S. Law Torture is Always Illegal   By MARJORIE COHN     What does torture have in common with genocide, slavery, and wars of aggression? They are all jus cogens. Jus cogens is Latin for "higher law" or "compelling law." This means that no country can ever pass a law that allows torture. There can be no immunity from criminal liability for violation of a jus cogens prohibition.    The United States has always prohibited the use of torture in our Constitution, laws executive statements and judicial decisions. We have ratified three treaties that all outlaw torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. When the United States ratifies a treaty, it becomes part of the Supreme Law of the Land under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.    The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, says, "No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification for torture."    Whether someone is a POW or not, he must always be treated humanely; there are no gaps in the Geneva Conventions. He must be protected against torture, mutilation, cruel treatment, and outrages upon personal dignity, particularly humiliating and degrading treatment under, Common Article 3.     In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, the Supreme Court rejected the Bush administration's argument that Common Article 3 doesn't cover the prisoners at Guantnamo. Justice Kennedy wrote that violations of Common Article 3 are war crimes.    We have federal laws that criminalize torture.    The War Crimes Act punishes any grave breach of the Geneva Conventions, as well as any violation of Common Article 3. That includes torture, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, and inhuman, humiliating or degrading treatment.    The Torture Statute provides for life in prison, or even the death penalty if the victim dies, for anyone who commits, attempts, or conspires to commit torture outside the United States.    The U.S. Army Field Manual's provisions governing intelligence interrogations prohibit the "use of force, mental torture, threats, insults, or exposure to unpleasant and inhumane treatment of any kind." Brainwashing, mental torture, or any other form of mental coercion, including the use of drugs, are also prohibited. Military personnel who mistreat prisoners can be prosecuted by court-martial under provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. These include conspiracy, cruelty and maltreatment, murder, manslaughter, maiming, sodomy, and assault.    In Filartiga v. Pe?a-Irala, the Second Circuit declared the prohibition against torture is universal, obligatory, specific and definable. Since then, every U.S. circuit court has reaffirmed that torture violates universal and customary international law. In the Paquete Habana, the Supreme Court held that customary international law is part of U.S. law.    The Constitution gives Congress the power to make the laws and the President the duty to carry them out. Yet on February 7, 2002, President Bush, relying on memos by lawyers including John Yoo, announced that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to alleged Taliban and Al Qaeda members. Bush said, however,    "As a matter of policy, the United States Armed Forces shall continue to treat detainees humanely and, to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity, in a manner consistent with the principles of Geneva."     But torture is never allowed under our laws.    Lawyers in the Department of Justices Office of Legal Counsel wrote memos at the request of high-ranking government officials in order to insulate them from future prosecution for subjecting detainees to torture. In memos dated August 1, 2002 and March 18, 2003, former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo (Jay Bybee, now a federal judge, signed the 2002 memo), advised the Bush administration that the Department of Justice would not enforce the U.S. criminal laws against torture, assault, maiming and stalking, in the detention and interrogation of enemy combatants.    The federal maiming statute makes it a crime for someone "with the intent to torture, maim, or disfigure" to "cut, bite, or slit the nose, ear or lip, or cut out or disable the tongue, or put out or destroy an eye, or cut off or disable a limb or any member of another person." It further prohibits individuals from "throwing or pouring upon another person any scalding water, corrosive acid, or caustic substance" with like intent.    Yoo said in an interview in Esquire that "just because the statute says -- that doesn't mean you have to do it." In a debate with Notre Dame Professor Doug Cassell, Yoo said there is no treaty that prohibits the President from torturing someone by crushing the testicles of the person's child. In Yoo's view, it depends on the President's motive, notwithstanding the absolute prohibition against torture in all circumstances.    The Torture Convention defines torture as the intentional infliction of severe phys|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	its when they have you laying on your back and your head is lower than your body and they basically pour water up your nose,    its perfectly legal and needs to be used more often, it gives the person the feeling they are drowning|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	Contrary to your first answer it is not illegal, although it has been prosecuted for in the past.  As a matter of fact it's part of the training for Navy Seals.  I hope to God it never happens to me, but I hope that someone's doing it to any terrorist wanting to harm my city where my kids go to school.      These are standard definitions:    Torture: existence of a specific purpose plus intentional infliction of severe suffering or pain;    Cruel or inhuman treatment: no specific purpose, significant level of suffering or pain inflicted;    Outrages upon personal dignity: no specific purpose, significant level of humiliation or degradation.     I think waterboarding would would fall under cruel treatment not torture.

ahjqc9Ifaa	Paraphrasing what others have said at a screenwriting board I visit: The big three, in terms of legitimacy and prestige for those who win or place high, are Nicholl, Chesterfield, and Disney. The second tier of good contests includes Sundance, FinalDraft, and ASA.    But there are lots more contests, and they're not all rip-offs. How can you tell the good ones from the bad?    First, check out what it takes to submit. Is the entry fee reasonable ($25 to $50)? Is the prize money at least 100 times greater than the entry fee? Are there any extra fees for consulting, critique, mailing or delivery beyond the initial submission, editing, photocopying, etc.?    Does the contest promise what no contest can deliver: guaranteed sales or options, connections, internships? (These things *can*come from doing well, but it's never a sure thing.) Are the judges people who are employed in the film industry and well qualified to judge the screenplays of others? What are their credentials?     Read the terms and conditions for submission all the way through, no matter how fine the print. Compare them to the Nicholl. Is there anything radically different? What might its impact be for the winner? Others who submit? Is there any benefit to you if you don't win (such as professional coverage for those who place high)?    Beware any contest which does not have a street address (not just a post office box) and a listed telephone number; which exists only online; which does not share the names of past winners and offer proof they received their prizes; which does not share the names and credentials of judges; which feels 'fishy' and seems too good to be true.    Remember, too, that there's some logic in thinking that if your screenplay is good enough to do well in a major contest, it's probably good enough to be marketing to agents or production companies.|`|vzuQqsR1aa	Zoetrope is having 1..  http://www.zoetrope.com/contests/index.c...

pI5jKfmaaa	Several sources( links) list a large number of horses. From two of the links the followin information is extracted for your use :  What was the name of Napoleon's horse?  By J.F. Lozier    http://www.napoleon-series.org/faq/c_hor...    Since so many of the paintings of Napoleon show him riding a horse, it has become a common trivia question to ask "What was the name of Napoleon's horse?". However, it is not an easy one to answer, for Napoleon owned and used over 150 horses during the course of his life. The most famous ones were:      Wagram, a gray Arab Napoleon rode from 1809 onwards, it was brought along during the Elba exile.      Roitelet, an English-Limousin chestnut given to Napoleon by Prince Eugene de Beauharnais, it carried Napoleon back from Russia and was ridden at Lutzen and Arcis-sur-Aube.      Intendant, a pure white Norman nicknamed "Coco" by the Imperial Guard. He was mainly used for parades and reviews because of his calm, steady, and graceful nature during such ceremonies.      Vizir, one of the Emperor's favorites, this gray Arab was a gift from the Sultan of Turkey in 1805 and 10 years later Napoleon brought it with him to Saint-Helena. It now resides  stuffed  in the Muse de l'Arme in Paris.      Marengo, a gray Arab captured after Waterloo. His skeleton is kept at the National Army Museum in London.      Tauris, this gray was a gift from Alexander (Tsar of Russia) was ridden by Napoleon at Vitepsk, Smolensk, Borodino, during his entrance in Moscow, and during the retreat from Russia. After being brought to Elba, it was ridden from Golf-Juan to Paris during the Hundred Days.      Cyrus, one of the horses Napoleon rode at Austerlitz.      Styrie, ridden by Bonaparte across the Great Saint-Bernard, and at Marengo.      Dsire, ridden at Waterloo.    The names of some of his other horses include: Aboukir, Familier, Cheikh, Triomphant, Austerlitz, Calvados, Cid, Cordoue, Sagonte, Slim, Bouffon, Conqurant, Extrme, Folatre, Gracieux, Timide, Sahara, Major, Belle, Distingu, Gisors, Lowska, Favori, Harbet, Nron, Tamerlan, Hippogriffe, Kurde, Labrador, Sara, picurien, Embelli, Gessner, Brant, Wuzbourg, Montevideo, Artaxercs, Aly, Coceyre, Sultan, Russe, Estime, Arabella, Babylonien, Euphrate, Hahim, Harbet, Helavert, Hricle, Lydienne, Lyre, Na?ade, Nankin, Naturaliste, Naufrag, Nausicaa, Navigateur, Navire, Ninon, Emin, Gonsalvo.      http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A35977855&...    The Emperor recognised the importance of horses for warfare and built up an impressive French cavalry. He re-opened the aristocratic studs that had been closed during the Revolution, even going so far as to encourage racing in the hopes that it would improve bloodlines as breeders competed to own the fastest animals.    It is no wonder, then, that Napoleon Bonaparte kept a stable of about 806 personal saddle horses besides the carriage horses and his personal stud, and owned and used over 150 horses in his lifetime. The names of several dozen mounts7 have been recorded by diligent record-keepers, but we have more information on a mere handful.    Le Vizir    This grey Arabian stallion was presented to Napoleon Bonaparte by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire as a token of friendship, and is known to have been one of his favourites. He accompanied his master to St Helena in 1815. After Napoleon's death on 5 May, 1821, Vizir was brought first to England and then to France, where he died in 1829. He was stuffed and mounted, and is currently on display at the Muse de l'Arme in Paris, along with the unknown dog that kept Napoleon company on Elba8.    Marengo    Another grey Arabian stallion, Marengo, is widely accepted to have been Napoleon's favourite and most-used mount, ridden during nearly all his campaigns. He has been identified in various paintings, although Napoleon's taste in horses means that it is hard to tell them apart. Also, many paintings are not historically accurate, created after the fact to glorify the Emperor. For example, Napoleon probably crossed the Alps on a mule, rather than a horse. Curiously enough, the meticulous stable records Napoleon kept show no evidence of a horse named 'Marengo', nor is he mentioned in any primary sources.    The most likely answer to this puzzle is Napoleon's habit of bestowing nicknames on those around him - after all, Josephine's given name was Rose. Many of his horses are known to have been renamed - for example, Napoleon's tall, pure-white Norman parade horse, Intendant, was affectionately nicknamed 'Coco' by the Imperial Guard, and Mon Cousin was rechristened Austerlitz while Cirus and Ingenu both became Wagram to commemorate famous victories. Conversely, Moscou was known as Tcherkes after the disastrous Russian campaign. It is assumed that the stallion Ali was called 'Marengo' after the Battle of Marengo on 14 June, 1800, in which he carried his master to victory. Napoleon also used him at Austerlitz, Jena-Auerstedt, Wagram, and Waterloo, and h|`|m1dzVuAtaa	It depends on which horse you want to know the name of. Napoleon had over 150 horses in his stables.     Here are a few:    - Wagram : a gray Arab Napoleon rode from 1809 onwards, it was brought along during the Elba exile.    - Roitelet : an English-Limousin chestnut given to Napoleon by Prince Eugene de Beauharnais, it carried Napoleon back from Russia and was ridden at Lutzen and Arcis-sur-Aube.    - Intendant : a pure white Norman nicknamed "Coco" by the Imperial Guard. He was mainly used for parades and reviews because of his calm, steady, and graceful nature during such ceremonies.    - Vizir : one of the Emperor's favorites, this gray Arab was a gift from the Sultan of Turkey in 1805 and 10 years later Napoleon brought it with him to Saint-Helena. It now resides  stuffed  in the Muse de l'Arme in Paris.    - Marengo : a gray Arab captured after Waterloo.

1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	Let's consider a variety of infinite sets to try and derive an answer to this.    Consider the set of all whole numbers.  It is infinite in size.  Yet in spite of this, each element is unique - no number is ever repeated.  This shows us that it is possible to have something infinite in size that does not repeat itself.    Consider the set of all positive whole numbers.  This set is also infinite in size yet demonstrably smaller than the set of all whole numbers.  Infinite does not mean beyond comparison.  If we add the set of all positive whole numbers to the set of all negative whole numbers we will have a set that different from the set of all whole numbers by exactly one element - the number zero.  So we can see that infinite sets can be distinguished by finite amounts.  Even very small ones.    Of course, the physical universe is not quite so unbounded as a numbering system.  The universe has laws which must be followed.  Some kinds of things are excluded.  But as we can see from our above analysis, even this doesn't necessarily mean that there aren't unlimited variations of living things or even perhaps unlimited variations of human beings.  The only time the number of combinations seem finite is when you impose a stricture that is not physically mandatory (like only combining known variations of current genes).    As far as I'm concerned, it seems possible.  But whether it actually is (or even whether the universe is infinite in size) is still a quite open question.|`|avVdKiWKaa	The concept of infinity is a slippery slope.  I submit there is no such thing.  Time (for this universe, anyway) began when the universe did, and it will end when the last photon takes its last bounce off of the last atom.  Though we have never seen a proton decay, it is a reach to say that it will last for infinity.  Recent astronomical data suggests that the universe may unravel sooner than we think, where negative energy overwhelms the strong nuclear force.    That said, infinity knows no bounds, which means that the *finite* number of combinations of all the atoms in the universe must repeat.  Even if it takes a gazillion gazillion to the twelfth power years to make the physical you manifest once again exactly as you are now, for inifinity that is not a problem.  Any span of time is not even a fraction of the time remaining when you compare it to an infinite amount of time.  In fact, you would re-manifest an infinite number of times.  It is like asking which set of numbers is larger -- an infinite set of integer numbers, or the infinite number of fractions between 0 and 1?  This is why infinity is a logical absurdity if it is bounded by time.|`|c95d0302c2211652aacf54a2a7f7550caa	yes, its probable|`|7e7002b6150c8c3eae2926c9baf2be5daa	You question assumes that we do, in fact, live in an infinite universe.  The jury is still out on that point.  But let us say that we do.  The question then becomes, "what is truly You".  and is there some threshold that must be reached before an entity can be determined as being "You".    And the greater question is, how do you know that 'you' are not the product of this having already happened?|`|DjWBGF4caa	Consider this. Perhaps this universe is YOU. Given that you hold a value of X and all other manifestation of X are X! (You to the infinite), the next or any other manifestation would indeed not be YOU. However, your existence is you to the infinite in the next manifestation. So then, it could be surmised that YOU now (X) has indelibly influenced, in some way, the next manifestation in some minute infinitesimal way which would not be you, inasmuch as you are now, but it is a part of you.     We both live and die forever. And to understand how X can also be Y at the same time, one would have to venture in to the realm of quantum physics. So perhaps in some manifestation along the way you could develop a technology for retrieving you in the future as you are now and interact with you of that future manifestation.     Consider that this has already happened, is happening, and will happen again. And that is exactly what is going on now.    All that you are now is all there is. Live for today. Tomorrow doesn't exist and yesterday was nothing but a dream. There is only the here and now. Yet again it could also be that the present doesn't exist and it's only the past and the future. Perhaps and probably, time is illusion.    None of this is happening.  All of this is happening.    It's all in you head, really. Or is it? Or both? Or neither.    This is what the Indian philosophers refer to as Catuskoti.  What's your take?

Everything that happens on this earth is connected in some way to everything else on this earth, and perhaps even the universe.

QEEweJUaaa	Born: 356 B.C.   Birthplace: Pella, Macedonia   Died: 323 B.C.   Best Known As: Conqueror of the ancient world   A towering figure of ancient Greek history, Alexander the Great is said to have come close to conquering the civilized world. The son of King Phillip II of Macedon, Alexander was educated by the philosopher Aristotle and first led troops at age 18. After his father's death he whipped the superpower Persians and conquered much of the civilized world. He died suddenly at age 33 after a bout of heavy drinking; some suggest he was poisoned, though no cause of death has ever been proved.    Alexander's favorite horse Bucephalus is one of history's famous steeds.      Alexander the Great (336-323 bc), son of Philip II and king of Macedon, was the greatest military commander of the ancient world; his achievements inspired envy and imitation from Roman generals such as Pompey, Caesar, and Trajan, and achieved legendary status in the Christian and Islamic worlds through the Romance of Alexander. The main surviving sources were written between 300 and 500 years after Alexander's death by the Greek authors Plutarch, who wrote a biography and also wrote two encomiastic essays; Arrian, whose history focuses on military action; and Diodorus and Curtius (Roman), whose interconnected accounts merit attention for preserving some darker aspects of Alexander's reign.    Aristotle was among his teachers and imparted a love for Homer as well as general intellectual curiosity. In 340 Alexander briefly served as royal regent, in 338 he led the decisive cavalry charge at Chaeronea and, in spite of dynastic tensions in 337-336, he was the only serious candidate to succeed when Philip was assassinated in 336. Alexander at once consolidated his hold with characteristic energy: an important Macedonian enemy, the nobleman Attalus, was murdered, the Thessalians elected him as leader, and the Greek states in the League of Corinth recognized his hegemony. In 335 Alexander marched north to impose his authority over Balkan neighbours, demonstrating strategic skill, tactical resourcefulness in response to sudden challenges, and a desire to surpass all previous achievements. Thebes rebelled during his absence, but his speed of movement disconcerted his Greek opponents; the Macedonians captured the city after fierce resistance and everything, except for temples and the house of the poet Pindar, was razed; survivors were sold into slavery. This severe treatment, which Alexander had his Greek allies confirm, cowed potential opponents such as Athens.    Alexander was now ready for the campaign against Persia which Philip had planned; Antipater remained in Macedon as regent and supervisor of Greek affairs. In 334 Alexander crossed the Hellespont with somewhat over 40, 000 infantry and 5, 000 cavalry; the crack troops were Macedonian, though there were also important units of Thessalian cavalry, and archers and javelin men from Crete and Thrace. His first undertaking was a pilgrimage to Troy, part of his heroic image building: Alexander was the new Achilles (a maternal ancestor), to whom his companion Hephaestion played Patroclus. Military matters then impinged, and the local Persians were overwhelmed at the Granicus. This allowed Alexander to dominate western Asia Minor, where the Greek cities welcomed their self-proclaimed liberator with mixed enthusiasm; Miletus attempted to remain neutral and was besieged, while the Persian garrison at Halicarnassus defended the citadel even after the loss of the lower town. As Alexander secured territory he ensured that Persian administrative arrangements were maintained, under Macedonian supervision, for financial and logistical reasons.    Alexander was now embarrassed by Persian supremacy at sea: his own naval forces were limited, since he could not rely on Athenian help; he focused on securing coastal cities but could do little to contain a Persian offensive in the Aegean during 333. The balance only shifted when the dynamic Memnon of Rhodes died and Darius recalled the Greek mercenaries to bolster his land army. In 333 Alexander rapidly traversed central Asia Minor, without imposing effective control on a marginal area, but was then detained in Cilicia by serious illness. The rout of Darius at Issus in November left the whole of the Levant open to Alexander, and 332 was spent securing the cities of Phoenicia: Tyre, apparently safe on its island, only succumbed after a six-month siege which demonstrated all Alexander's considerable determination and skill; Gaza too held out bravely, and the black side to Alexander's heroic character was revealed in the mutilation of the gallant enemy commander. Control of the Levant brought with it the submission of the last Persian naval contingents. Alexander's final action before leaving the Mediterranean world was to visit Egypt, where he was recognized as pharaoh; more important for his image was the trip to the oracle of Ammon, located in the desert.|`|AA10729675	I'm afraid Frightnight is accurate but does not answer your question.  All F. says is true but concerns the beginning of the campaign or expedition (anabasis) of Alexander.  To anwer your question: yes.  After conquering the whole Persian Empire, Alexander wanted to circumnavigate the whole world as it was known.  He intended to build huge triremes and explore, and conquer.  His intentions were read after his death by Eumenes who had written down all his plans.  But His Successors found his plans costly, unfeasible and useless.  That is because they did not have Alexander's intelligence, but also because they did not have his drive, which in Greek is called "pothos".  "Pothos" is a key-word in Alexander's life and achievements.  He may be in the whole of history the only man with such 'pothos' .  It baffles all historians and everyone.

70792699b0148f1c86dfafe277533b54aa	I say you have to JUST DO IT!  Once you get started it's always more fun than watching T.V. or something.  I love books, too.  Put on a soundtrack- like Dances with Wolves or Willow (okay those are two of MY favorites) and let it read like a movie.  It's so wonderful and relaxing!  Just be glad you don't have a baby screaming every few minutes like me! lol (Luv my baby though)|`|ENAEcBOmaa	reading should be fun, dont read it if you dont want to. if its homework, then pace yourself and set a goal. you can do it.
NjYCvfYGaa	I hope you have no intentions of scam...<br>  There are countless amount of sites floating around the web waiting to scam young kids with dreams.<br>  <br>  Do you have an office? If you do, name it after the area your in.<br>  Like my city is called Angel City.<br>  The local talent agency is named Angel City Talent.|`|264cbcb58c2a9871fb67a37251391020aa	To be honest, I'd avoid using an unusual surname - the difficulties with spelling it may make it harder for people to locate the company.<br>  <br>  How about Talented Tots'n'Teens?<br>  <br>  Or Clever Kids?
Ow3O7h4caa	Hi<br>  <br>  By far the best method to clean bass strings is to soak them in denatured alcohol. You will be amazed at how well cleaning your bass strings this way works. In some parts of the world denatured alcohol is called methylated spirits.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to remove your strings and soak them, you need to use this denatured alcohol. NOTE that this product does the job but also poisonous, and very flammable. Don’t use or store it near any heat source – cigarettes, water heaters, fireplaces,<br>  <br>  Don’t use rubbing alcohol as a substitute because it contains water which may rust your strings. Just use denatured alcohol from your local hardware/home improvement store|`|dd2df7fc5cba9f11d754885dd4f51a59aa	I'm a cellist and I would certainly not use alcohol on my strings! get a new yellow duster and make it your "bass duster" - keep it in your case and, before putting your bass away, give the strings a quick rub with the it. This will stop the rosin caking up and being hard to remove. Also do this with the wood of the bow, the finger board and the body. I wrap my spike holder and rosin in my cello duster so I never forget to do it =]
cgz85foTaa	foil?|`|KJt9XSY4aa	Supporting character?<br>  Minor Character?<br>  <br>  If you're talking about the main characters best friend, it's probably a supporting character. If you're talking about some wizened old crone only in the story to dispense information, you're probably talking about a minor character.|`|mvrLuuRIaa	The supporting characters. They are there to make sure the story continues on by helping the main character understand the situtaions she or he has found themselves in.
sjMIFH9Faa	It really depends on what you call Terrorism. It really has no exact definition. When Napoleon invaded Russia for no apparent reason, the Russians responded by burning food supplies, poisoning wells, and waited for winter to kill French troops. Is that terrorism or just effective strategy?<br>  <br>  When Darius the Persian emperor invaded the Sythians, the Sythians responded by burning crops, poisoning wells, and ambushing small groups of Persians from behind then running away. Is that terrorism? See Herodotus for more information.<br>  <br>  When the Spartans invaded Athens they chopped down their olive trees to destroy the Athenian economy for at least the next 20 years. (Athens traded olive oil for grain and it takes 20 years after planting for an olive tree to bare fruit) Is this terrorism? <br>  <br>  General Sherman in the Civil War marched his troops to Atlanta burning every Confederate house, farm...etc, then burned Atlanta to the ground. This got the Confederates to finally surrender. Is this terrorism?<br>  <br>  <br>  The truth is we call Middle Eastern fighters terrorists because they dont fight fair. But they have been invaded, they have inferior numbers, inferior technoledge, and inferior training. If they lined up and attacked us from the front, they would be slaughtered. So they fight a gorilla war. Every time a superior force attacks an inferior force, the inferior force fights dirty, they would be stupid not to.|`|NpWKUz0qaa	Many would say 11/9 was justified, but if you take an example when nearly all people justify terrorism so:     <br>  <br>  <br>  During 2 WW, the danish and the french terrorism against the german troops that occupied their country and against people suspected to collaborate with them.<br>  <br>  The bombing of Dresden is very similar to Hiroshima and Nagasaki with difference that instead of atombombs they felled tonnes of normal bombs so nearly the whole city destroyed and tens of thousands of people killed<br>  <br>  I have hard to see how terrorism can be selfdefence, terrorism is assymetric warfare, just another form of war. So if you mean that war can be selfdefence, yes then terrorism that meats a stronger opponent that try to chrush the terrorists, always schould be seen as selfdefence.<br>  <br>  Yeah the nazis were undoubtly much more cruel against terrorists  than the americans, but with that said, there is nothing that says that terrorism against the iraqi and aghanistan occupationforces isnt the same thing when all comes around. Germany was in a more desperate situation and was suffering much heavier losses than the US and this can explain Germanys harsher way of treating the terrorists|`|60FCA8dVaa	In the Revolutionary War we were terrorists against our King in order to create our own country. The British used conventional military tactics and the Americans used guerrilla warfare tactics. That's how we won. Read a history book called "A Few Bloody Noses".|`|PHlcM9YFaa	Terrorism can not be used as self defence, it is why it is called Terrorism.|`|YA36FUf1aa	Some of the more violent Palestinian responses to repeated Israeli attacks.|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	most of the resistance in WW2 would be considered terrorism- people in civilian clothing fighting agains uniformed troops.<br>  <br>  There are serious differences though- for one the nazis used terror against the civilians even when not provoked. deportations, mass arrests, torture (and I don't mean 'waterboarding" or loud music but the old-fashionned stuff with drills, whips, hot iron and spikes under the nails)<br>  Just outside Warsaw there is the Palmiry forest- a place of mass executions of prominent civilians (university professors, politicians, sportsmen) the first such execution took place a week after the germans won the campaign in Poland- way before any resistance ever came to exist.<br>  For example Franz Kutschera, Nazi German SS General and commander of german forces in Warsaw was "murdered" in broad daylight in 1944. That guy was responsible- among other things- for the execution of the Jews in Warsaw Ghetto and the public executions of Poles for any reason (e.g. giving a piece of bread to a Jew was punishable by death)<br>  If killing such scum is terrorism- so be it.

0tpLq6meaa	Rich- this way you could help the poor and have a positive effect on peoples lives. And you could also experience the other side= just give all your money away and you could find out quick.|`|AA11635601	Some rich people are empty in their souls and unhappy - but you don't have to be.  You can be rich and happy, rich and unhappy, poor and happy or poor and unhappy.

It is a relationship of love, makes both happy.  However the richest person on the planet is the one who knows 100% that every-thing, everything and EVERYTHING belongs to God.|`|s3FRQJ3Xaa	Id rather be rich.

Also if you have a enough money you can live above the law.<br>  <br>  Being poor is very very hard but since you have to do everything it builds character and you have to learn to respect other people.<br>  <br>  I'd rather live poor. It might be hard but I would probably have a loving family and what not.|`|DXXpHKupaa	Rich and Poor are relative.<br>  <br>  I'm rich in that I want nothing else, I'm content with what I have.  I live in a small one bedroom apartment.  I walk to work and I make enough to eat and pay my bills-with a little left over to buy a good book now and then.  I'm content with what I have so I am wealthy.<br>  <br>  Others are poor because no matter how much they have-they want more.  You can be poor and own a mansion and ten cars.<br>  <br>  Being truly wealthy is knowing when you have enough.|`|Z8E8nTXSaa	we all would like money but i am more concerned about my salvation and my happiness---as long as i have that i am good!|`|0Ikzr2Taaa	If I was rich there would so much good I could for people and animals. But if I were poor I would try and work to become rich and use the money for good.|`|bMk6xZaSaa	There is a good chance that I will be going into the Sisters of Charity when I get out of high school.  These sisters are the group of sisters that Mother Teresa started.  They make a vow to poverty.  I would say that it is only more fulfilling when you make it that way like the people in the movie.  There are plenty of charitable things you can do in the United States alone that you would cause you to find your life fulfilling. For example - habitat for humanity, helping Katrina victims, teaching inner city students, helping in food kitchens...though these things are nothing like what you see in the movie, every little bit helps.  Makes you feel better about where you were born doesn't it?

f339a9f3cf7d571157484d675d6af3b7aa	Find a comfortable spot and just start off by reading the short stories that are in the Good Housekeeping magazines or the Readers Digest.  Once you can absorb those then branch out to short story books that have a minimum of 50 - 60 pages.  Once you feel comfortable with that pick a genre: suspense, thriller, mystery or romance - make sure it also has a minimum of pages. Then before you know it you are advancing and getting books with a lot more pages and voila you are now a reader.. Absorb yourself into the story and become the main character and that is what gets you hooked.|`|hErIPLYdaa	Maybe it's because you haven't found something that interests you yet? Don't give up, keep searching and eventually you'll find a book that hooks you completely! :)<br>  <br>  I know that a lot of people that didn't read before do now because of books like the Twilight Saga. It's just a case of trying out different genres, like fantasy, horror, romance, etc., until you find something that gets you interested. Maybe try a funny book about the modern world, like the Shopaholic books (coming out soon as a film) or the Percy Jackson books if you want to try humour and greek myths =D? If not, short stories are always a good place to start.<br>  <br>  I'm an avid reader so if you need any recommendations then feel free to email me!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|4BvFnxTyaa	Start off with movies.<br>  What kind of movies do you like to watch? Movies could determine what books you might like to try. Say for example, you like to watch science fiction. Find some interesting books that have to deal with science fiction.<br>  Maybe even write a few stories of your own that you find awesome. So after you've read science fiction novels and compared them, why not get the most out of what you are interested in?

iNXqiDIYaa	Your best bet would be to go and talk to the "documents" specialist at any local museum - one dealing with the city's history.  They should be able to identify it andmay be able to value it for you.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't think it would be of more than a little local value - the museum might pay a small amount for it.  An exception would be if it can be shown and verified that someone famous had a hand in prepariong the documents (a famous architect perhaps or anyone starting out in life that may have becopme famous in another field) - then the value could increase substantially

tiABWrkeaa	One of the term used to describe the Great War was the "War to Save the World for Democracy." (in this case, the government of France and Britain and the desire to have one in Germany) The suffragette pointed out how this was hypocrisy. How could the war have been to save democracy when half of the country couldn't vote? One famous sign point out this discrepancy said,  "Kaiser Wilson, have you forgotten your sympathy with the poor Germans because they were not self-governing? 20,000,000 American women are not self-governing. Take the beam out of your own eye" Wilson here is President Woodrow. Under him the 19th Amendment was passed in 1920.|`|YMI6Yl18aa	Women's suffrage was a long campaign that was helped greatly by the war. It gave women the opportunity to prove themselves in roles that were previously only for men. Whereas before men always thought they were incapable of equality, they now couldn't deny that they needed women to fill in for them and help run the country. The Women stepped up to the mark and proved that they could do just what the men did and this was an unavoidable fact. The country was indebted to the women who helped in all sorts of ways, especially on the home front, with ammunitions and weapons, food and health care.|`|X8zMlF0jaa	While the men were away fighting, women took the roles of men: doing their jobs. After the war, when the men came back, they demanded their jobs and women went quietly back into the home but were not happy. This made them have the power to join the forces in WW2.

They are good.<br>  <br>  I think, yes they are good, but no, they aren't a person's life, they are just books. It is dumb to be obsessed with it. Yes, I understand, you like them, but they are just books.

The endless descriptions of Edward's golden eyes get highly irritating after a while, as does Bella's whiny self-involvement, especially in New Moon. But other than that I enjoyed them. Almost as much as I enjoy pointing out their many flaws to rabid fans :D|`|gb4VzNXQaa	I've read better but they were okay.|`|LnRj41Hraa	Personally I like them. But no I'm not an obsessed fan girl who squeals when they hear Edward Cullen's name. I'm more an Emmett girl. I like the characters, some happy go lucky other slightly bitter. The forbidden love and love triangle that was all a little to predictable in the first three and then the little devil sperm in the fourth. <br>  <br>  The side characters are more funnier than the main characters and likable. Though the Cullen's are adorable. Edward is the girl most girls dream about. perfect in every aspect but he himself is tormented. <br>  <br>  Bella, well I hate her. I think she a whiny, needy but hey that my opinion. Jacob and the werewolves are awesome with their fiery tempers and explosive characteristics. So yes. I like the damn books.|`|4BvFnxTyaa	I enjoyed reading them just like I enjoy reading any other book.

qRx3ynKdaa	Clichés:<br>  <br>  1.. A knight errant comes upon a castle which is ruled by a young and beautiful woman who is being a besieged by an evil knight who wants to marry her though she wants nothing to do with him. The beautiful woman immediately falls in love with the knight, who defeats the besieger. Pure wish fulfillment.<br>  <br>  2.) The Queen has taken a young and handsome knight as her lover. However the young knight, though wounded, one night goes to bed with the queen. Next morning, blood is found on the Queen’s bed. (What happens next varies in different tales.)<br>  <br>  3.) It is prophesied that only the best knight in the world can perform a particular act, The hero of the story performs that act.<br>  <br>  4.) A young knight has a fairy mistress, but she forbids him to speak of her. The Queen attempts to seduce the young knight, and he refuses her, and in his anger says that he already has a mistress more beautiful than she is. Now, when he summons his mistress, she no longer appears and the King demands that he prove his statement. At the last moment, the mistress appears and takes her lover away with her to her own land.<br>  <br>  5.) A squire who does not know his own name and origin asks to be knighted. He will prove to be one of the best knights of the world and to be of high birth.<br>  <br>  6.) Sir Kay insults a knight. Later, the knight defeats Sir Kay in a joust.<br>  <br>  7.) An unknown knight is seen near court, and Arthur asks that he be summoned to come to the court. He first sends Kay, who is battles the knight and is defeated. He then sends Gawain who through his courtesy persuades the knight to come to court without a fight.<br>  <br>  8.) A dwarf or ugly damsel blames a knight for previously not undertaking a particular task, as he was the one destined to fulfill that task, The knight then goes seeking out the task to fulfill it.<br>  <br>  9.) A boat floats into court. In it is a dead knight who needs to be avenged, or a sleeping knight who has come to fulfill a task.<br>  <br>  10.) Queen Guenevere is abducted or almost abducted (by Melwas/Meliagant or by Valerin, or by Gazozein, or by King Lot, or by Bors of Gaunes, or by Brun of Morois, or by Mordred.)<br>  <br>  11.) A knight comes to a marvelous castle ruled by a Queen who attempts to seduce him. (The Queen is often Morgaine the Fay.)<br>  <br>  12.) Two knights battle not knowing who the other is. It turns out that they are father and son, or two brothers, or at the least very close friends. The battle breaks off when they recognize one another, but sometimes either one or both of the knights die.<br>  <br>  13.) When the lord of a castle is defeated, the man who defeated him is made lord, and must agree to fight all comers, until he himself is defeated and slain, at which point that knight will become lord. This is the “king who slew his slayer, and shall himself be slain.”<br>  <br>  14.) A lady upbraids her knight for breaking in explicit or implicit promise to her. (She finds him in bed with another woman or he didn’t return when he promised he would.) The knight goes mad with grief and wanders unrecognized as a madman through the countryside.<br>  <br>  15.) In fulfilling quest, the knight must pass several river crossings, each one of which is guarded by a hostile knight. These knights are usually brothers or kinsmen to one another.<br>  <br>  16.) A knight refuses to give his name (or at least his normal name) and insists on doing his deeds incognito.<br>  <br>  17.) A knight is challenged to a game in which he will behead an opponent without resistance, but must then agree to put himself in the same position.<br>  <br>  18.) A king or knight promises to fulfil a promise without giving any restrictions. He is then asked to do something horrible like murder his sister or kill a particular knight who has done no wrong.<br>  <br>  19.) A knight has a particular nickname which was given to him in scorn by Sir Kay when the knight first came to court.<br>  <br>  20.) A monster (dragon or giant) is slain by knight. The knight beheads the monster, cuts out his tongue, and then falls asleep. A seneschal discovers that the monster is dead, takes its head, and claims to have slain it.|`|5781cee19923e98aad5a257688d6e71faa	well, most historical romance (and romance novels in general) follow patterns.<br>  <br>  There is an innocent (heroine - normally headstrong & gorgeous but doesn't know it) and a rogue (hero - normally he is a pirate, a rake, or a bastard with blueblood).  <br>  At first they clash, or their love is clandestine.  <br>  Next there is an obstacle - either class systems, family keeping them apart (think Romeo and Juliet), or they struggle internally to deny their love.<br>  Then there is a reveal of passion and he takes her innocence.<br>  Then something happens to resolve the obstacle and there is happily ever after.<br>  Then sometimes there is an epilogue that skips forward a year about how they are fantastically happy and have a baby.<br>  <br>  Just like real life, right?  Just kidding.  If they are written well, or have a great twist then they can be fantastic.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your paper.  I would maybe recommend reading some romance novel synopses on Amazon.  Also, check out the link below, i found it while trying to remember male character types.

XxILKutWaa	What do you mean by ABT older? I'm assuming you mean either the higher level ABT programs or the collegiate program.<br>  <br>  In pretty much all cases I daresay it is more difficult to get into SAB. Especially at an advanced age (15+) the requirements for both technique and physical facility will be much more closely examined.<br>  <br>  Also factoring in at SAB is the smaller student body acceptance size. ABT has several sites for their program, thus allowing for many more students! Whereas SAB only has the one location in already-crowded NYC, thus making it more selective. <br>  <br>  All in all, SAB is really one of the hardest--if not THE hardest--summer intensive programs to get into. Best of luck!

05anyV31aa	 You could also say that there was no other reasonable way to fight the First World War. Haig made some errors but land was the objective, to push Germany out of Northern France. Even land was gained at the horrible battle at the Somme River. Haig managed to win the First World War despite the tactical succeses of the Germans in the last year of the war. Even theses triumphs came at a great cost to the Germans.<br>  <br>    The war could not have been won without a large number of infantry dying to hold positions, attacked fortified entrenchments and other technological innovations made before and during the war.|`|TzogAxLFaa	Yes and no.  The generals of all sides involved in WWI expended the lives of their troops in distressing numbers.  In part this was because of the peculiar situation of the state of technology.  Machine-guns, grenades and rapid-firing rifles had made any infantry advance costly at best and suicidal at worst; yet the tank and the aircraft were in their infancy.  If Haig was a butcher, then so were Foch, Petain, Falkenheyn, Hindenburg etc.  The worst that can be said of Haig is that he did not possess the genius to change the nature of the war.  Then again, nor did anyone else.

4d3a7bbc1dffd218b8922b7e1819ce90aa	Friday comes from a culture that is primitive, pagan, and cannibalistic.  All qualities sure to horrify readers when the book was published (not that most modern readers are likely to be thrilled by cannibalism).  Crusoe tries to make Friday culturally acceptable by giving him a dose of Christianity, a veneer of what passed for modern then, and convinces him that eating humans is not acceptable, no matter how hungry you are or well prepared with sauces and garnishes they are.|`|NbgxNAYZaa	It always amazed me when people didn't understand other cultures that they felt they had to "civilize" them.

VWfN6Lhwaa	At your age, it is perfect for ballroom dancing and keep in mind that any dance background would definitely help in this transition. My suggestion is to take some ballroom lessons at community centers just to get the idea whether or not you like it before you decide to make that change and also it is much cheaper than at the dance studios. If you really like it, then the best way is join University Ballroom dance teams in your area. Most of the teams do not require that you have to be student but I am not sure about age limitation, so check with them. The team actually helps you to excel your dance skills plus you will be able to represent them for collegiate competitions. It is really fun and excitement and you will be surprised that you will meet some of professional dancers.<br>  <br>  I don't know where you live but private ballroom lessons at that price is really cheap in opposed to where I live (California), it costs between $75-$120 per 45 min depending on instructors professional level. FYI, there are 2 styles in ballroom dancing: AMERICAN and INTERNATIONAL. See attached website for more info. It is a great site and very informative. Enjoy your free basic lessons and keep on dancing.|`|ZtECjEPyaa	ballroom is WAY more boring than jazz!! But, if you really want to do ballroom...then do it. but i wouldn't be surprised if you regretted quiting jazz.|`|0U7BwGdHaa	Well..definitely look around to see if there are any other studios that offer ballroom at a cheaper price. I think you should stick out your Jazz class until June. I will almost guarantee you will regret and miss it if you quit..but if you go until the end of the season..relax for the summer.. it can help you decide on what you want to do?? Just hang in there!!!|`|Xqno8BTKaa	Why don't you keep doing jazz, and then if you find a cheap place to do ballroom, do ballroom and jazz at the same time for a few lessons till you decide which one you like better. I used to do calisthenics for a while till I was 10, and I just stopped liking it. I didn't want to go anymore, and my twin sister did ballroom, so I started that and loved it. I've been doing it for the last 7 1/2 years and I'm so glad I tried it.
nsqGHXzeaa	For me, i start with taking the idea and just freewriting about what is going to happen. Not necessarily an outline, but a couple pages or so about what is going to happen. Then, i focus on the characters and describe the ones that i know will be in there, even the ones that i may add, in a good paragraph each. And, if you have a problem with description, i always find that i write a paragraph about where each scene that you know about with take place- the senses. (smell, looks, texture of the surrounding things, etc.)<br>  <br>  But also, it depends on whether you have the idea for what the novel will be about or not. Before i start a novel, i always have an idea of what storyline the book will be about. So go off of that, and if you need to get more ideas just freewrite about all the possible happenings, chosing your favorites to put in. :-)<br>  <br>  Good luck! Hope this helps!|`|G4XkXsbeaa	Lots do an outline of the plot and character profiles.

Try getting a really large sheet of paper and drawing the end of a room, which people in it. Draw friends and family members watching television. Draw strangers in cafes. (And you can have a stack of cards with you to hand out, you might make some sales this way.) Take photographs also, you never know when you might want a colour reference if you decide to colour in a drawing later. <br>  <br>  And very important - go into contemporary art galleries and see what's on, read statements, look around, talk to people about what they are doing, find out what makes them tick. This is incredibly useful, for when you find yourself hitting a brick wall also, you can just look back on what you've seen and see if anything makes you go 'ping' inside.<br>  <br>  Look at mine: http//:orlasart.blogspot.com/

I mean ideally the reason a writer writes is because they have an idea burning inside of them that is aching to get out.  Most writers should be brimming with ideas if they plan to be successful at it.  I was told that some of these people don't want to be published and are just writing for themselves.  To that I say then invest those energies on real world application.  Join the school paper, yearbook staff or literary magazine if you are in grade school.  In college you should be entering contest, attending writer/author workshops and working on your school work.  <br>  <br>  ---  Take internships, volunteer, anything to work on your writing except clogging up Y!A, B&A.<br>  <br>  ---  If this is something you want to pursue seriously then if you want or need help you need to find a critique group, or classes.  People who can get a real sense of you, your abilities and offer personal advice to help you improve.  You need to learn about the industry as a whole and get reliable information.  Some of the answers are just other kids who are giving their opinion and they have no idea what it really is to deal with an editor, or look at a query letter, or meet authors who are published in a variety of genres.  <br>       For that you should join a writer's association where the members are published and unpublished but who know both writing technique and the industry.|`|ScaAyzKHaa	Absolutely, if you can't come up with your own material, are you really a writer?

aZUszuqLaa	We're all here to learn how to find our way back to the Light.  Overcoming the ego, (fear, lack, guilt, etc.) is the way to salvation.  Jesus transcended the "flesh" (ego) at the resurrection, showing us that the body is not the Spirit, because the Spirit is eternal.|`|AA11564934	Assuming you are serious, the urge to stay alive is what keeps the species going.  if some species has no desire to stay alive, it goes extinct.<br>  <br>  You expect life to be something it's not and are depressed.  Life has no meaning.  Pamela Anderson has just as much cosmic significance as Gandhi.  Live and enjoy what u can.  To be upset by that is to want to change the entirety of existence which isn't going to happen.  It's liek being mad at gravity.|`|H6ixrUYLaa	That's a lot of questions all at once.<br>  I think the majority of the people that want to stay alive forever are either afraid of death, or selfish enough to take their life for granted.  Death is a part of nature and it's foolish to think you can defy it.<br>  And as for you wanting to feel pain.  I doubt death is any more painful than life.  Death can be a physical pain sometimes, but life combines physical and emotional pain: much worse.<br>  You see the same thing every day because people have routines that they feel safe and comfortable with.  They are driving towards their hope of success.<br>  As far as leaving the world, I'm assuming you mean dying, it depends on what you believe to answer where you go.  Some believe in a Heaven and Hell, while others believe carcasses sit and rot in the ground.|`|6jAVElX7aa	people want to stay alive,because the will to live is stronger than the will to die. Jus think how strong a person's will if when someone asks them to give their life over to Christ Jesus. the catholic church had some part in the population explosion , as they encourage women to bear children and that is was an honour to die when giving birth to a child,  the world is not exactly as when you are talking about the earth. The heavens and earth were created by God,when you are talking the world it means more the values of the world system. Instead thinking about dying, try to be more compassionate to those who struggle and are having a difficult time. Like our Lord Jesus said "it is more blessed to give than to receive."|`|860c6e6cbb0a45ed8571556722c3f97aaa	They are afraid to die.|`|bC5XeVEIaa	Because the nature of life is to procreate and survive.<br>  <br>  Yes I have. But where will I go? We are a social species. By myself, I am effectively nothing.<br>  <br>  Well, you can build a rocket. But again, where will you go? How long do you think you can survive? The other option is to die.<br>  <br>  Every person has his or her own creed. Everyone has found his or her own significance for life, predisposed or not. They are going to live their lives for that reason.<br>  <br>  People populated the world so quickly on a reproductive exponent. Where there were two, there are now 6. Where there were 6, there are now 18. Where there were 18, there are now 54. And so on, and so on. And that's if you don't believe in evolution. Where there is little threat to our lives from predators, we are free to spread like wildfire.<br>  <br>  That's a matter of faith. I'll not debate that until I have proof. As far as we know, death means oblivion.<br>  <br>  I think the more important question is where this universe came from.<br>  <br>  Edit: Pending - God created the world and created him?

All the best theorys out there make the claim that NONE of us are here by force. Your contiousness formed in this reality for one reason or another. In doing so it did not take into account liniar space time or any of the infenet possibilities assosiated with it. Contiousness at its core only observs the end result, EXPERIENCE! <br>  To the contiousness this life time will be over the moment it started. time as we know it does not exist beyond our small portion of the univers. <br>  This life, everything we know of is merly a random flucuation of energy acting and reacting to other forms of energy. And while the contiousness is very apperent and seems to exist aside from this random dacne of energy, we do not yet have to means to proove its existance out side this small special and indeed very important part of space and time..<br>  PS... its is my conclution that you have not open'd your mind to the possibilitys of this word far enough. Stop wondering who those people are and where thay are going, and get out there with them. Go where they are going. Ask why are they going there. Drive one of those cars. EXPERIENCE! Remember, time has no meaning out side our existance, the suffering is just one more thing to experience. No experience good or bad is turn'd away. ITS ALL GOOD! Use your time here to record and discover as much as 'humanly" possible. Parhaps this will lead to other questions? perhaps it will bring inner peace and acceptance. Only you can make it happen.

It is said also that the eyes are the mirror of the soul. If you are troubled, it will show in your eyes. If you are sad, your countenance will also show that. If you are dead within, your eyes will also show that.  So turn to our Lord Christ Jesus, who gives you immeasurable joy and faith even through the bad times.

Sometimes adults get meanings/ things in it that younger readers wouldn't.|`|Es2QJ44Uaa	Twighlight was good but I much prefer the Harry Potter series.|`|1jMwr6E0aa	I am a die hard Harry Potter fan. The first thing I must comment on is DO NOT JUDGE HARRY POTTER BASED ON THOSE RIDICULOUS MOVIES! I'm begging you. I started with this series and I've read just about every other popular series out that compares to it. The Chronicles of Narnia included and now the Twilight series. So far, nothing comes close to this one. I will admit that its not because JK Rowling is a better author, (Meyer and Rowling are pretty neck and neck in my opinion, meaning that they've both got a lot to learn when it comes to a few things) only that her imagination is greater. Meyer is trying to convince you that this is the world you know just with Vampires and Werewolves. JKR is trying to convince you that there is an entire WORLD that we know nothing about directly beneath our noses. JKR explores romance through a male lead unlike Meyer who uses a female lead, though the theme of "Love Conquering All" is prevalent in both books. The difference lies in the fact that men and women are just different in the way that they process and express their emotions. You'll never hear something so melodramatic in Harry Potter like (forgive me this is me paraphrasing) "I won't live without you I thought I told you that". If that's the kind of romance you're looking for (Romeo & Juliet) this series is not for you. Harry isn't the kind of suave man who would say something like that. The love in this story is significant through loss. I cried reading the Harry Potter series because I got so attached to his character and I just wanted to see him happy. But that can't happen because of his duty and obligation. He chooses the needs of many versus the needs of one. Bella chooses the needs of one versus the needs many.

The graphic novel is a comic book version of the first book.<br>  <br>  As you can see there are only six books in the series so far. The sixth book ended with a cliffhanger and Eoin has said that it is not the last book in the series, but it will be the last for at least three years.|`|H0m1ACiJaa	The series currently includes six novels, the last of which (The Time Paradox) was released early 2008. However, there are two extra books. The graphic novel of the first book (Artemis Fowl), and a special edition book called "The Fowl Files." The Fowl Files contains two stories which take place in the gaps between novels.<br>  <br>  Complete List of Artemis Fowl Books/Stories in Chronological Order:<br>  <br>  0.5. LEPrecon (Story in "The Fowl Files")<br>  1. Artemis Fowl/Artemis Fowl The Graphic Novel<br>  1.5 The Seventh Dwarf (Story in "The Fowl Files")<br>  2. Artemis Fowl The Arctic Incident<br>  3. Artemis Fowl The Eternity Code<br>  4. Artemis Fowl The Opal Deception<br>  5. Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony<br>  6. Artemis Fowl and the Time Paradox<br>  <br>  As for the seventh book, there's a few loose ends to tie up after "The Time Paradox". Firstly, the two Opals now on the loose. Also, there are some things I'm sure readers would like to see, like some romance concepts for Artemis, how things will turn out with his mother, if Juliet will make an appearance, what happens to the demons, what happens to Artemis' magic, etc etc.<br>  Can't wait for the next one! I wish he would just keep writing and writing them, I love these books.<br>  I have heard that Eoin Colfer is giving the series a rest for a couple of years, then maybe writing a seventh book. Artemis Fowl Confidential (www.artemis-fowl.com), one of the books fansites, has posted an exclusive interview with Eoin Colfer, that gives "bare, possible plot details for another Artemis book, information on The Supernaturalist II, a title for Eoin's upcoming adult noir comedy book, and so much more!"|`|A2ir3qvtaa	The Seventh Dwarf is not the seventh book of the series. It's one of the two short stories in the Artemis Fowl Files. The seventh book is called Artemis Fowl: The Time Paradox<br>  I've read it and it's really interesting nad Artemis has really changed in the book, although I kinda miss the old Artemis...|`|wyUIGcFWaa	i heard there might be a seventh. but not for at least next three years...
ZN4tlYV9aa	the above answer is amazing, and i would like to say my own little opinion (yes, i actually had to write that...and this) i think that drawing ANYTHING by hand is way better than by computer. i mean...just the concept of YOU DRAWING WITH YOUR OWN HANDS!!! It's way better than a digitalized drawing, whether it's architecture, or whatever. plus, i think by hand you can get more details in.|`|AA12339318	No way.<br>  <br>  While final architectural drawing are mostly done on computers, there are a LOT of sketching steps that are typically done before the final out put.<br>  <br>  A quick thumbnail sketch can be done in seconds on any piece of scrap paper lying around.  But one won't always have a computer on hand to do this.  Inspiration can strike almost anywhere.  Plus, artists, engineers and others often communicate 3D structures in visual form a lot better in drawing than can often be done verbally.<br>  <br>  Good drawing and sketching skills remain essential in these and other fields.  Remember, even the most powerful computer graphics programs don't make someone into a good artist.  The computer is merely a tool to be used where appropriate.  The mechanical ink pen didn't make the pencil obsolete.<br>  <br>  In my line, I have gone almost 100% digital, but for most assignments, the thumbnail, quick sketch is an essential step.  I can whip out a half dozen layout ideas in less time than it takes a computer to bood up.  I wouldn't bother to use the computer for this step any more than I'd use a sixteen pound maul to crack walnuts.|`|Hd4vMUZaaa	In addition to the above answers, its quite essential for an Architect to demonstrate an idea infront of a client. Its almost impossible to conceptualise on computer. Conceptualising a design on paper is effortless, and has no boundries. The moral to the story, even if an Architect sucks at drawing, he's still required to draw. This is where an Architect's creative flares truely shine.
55XTsmmFaa	Here is my best 'recipe' for flesh tone colors:<br>  <br>  1. Titanium white<br>  2. Cadmium Red Light<br>  3. Cadmium Yellow Medium<br>  4. Yellow Ochre<br>  5. Burnt Sienna<br>  6. Burnt Umber<br>  7. Ultramarine Blue.<br>  <br>  For light flesh tones use colors 1, 2, 3, and 5.<br>  For medium flesh tones use 2, 3, 4 and 5.<br>  For dark flesh tones use 2, 5, 6 and 7.|`|AA12339318	WHO'S skin color?<br>  <br>  Bernie Mac?<br>  <br>  Michael Jackson?<br>  <br>  Jackie Chan<br>  <br>  Randy Jackson?<br>  <br>  Scarlett Johanssen?<br>  <br>  Plus, what PART of the skin.  The skin on the nose tends to be a VERY different color from the forehead.  The color of the cheeks is much different than the color of the chin.  The skin UNDER the chin is not the same as the color of the skin on the back of the hand.<br>  <br>  Look closely at the skin tones of your subject and you'll see what I mean.<br>  <br>  But I can suggest a good start.<br>  <br>  Begin with a fairly light pink and dull it a bit with a tiny touch of green.<br>  <br>  Then adjust according to the direction you need to go with that skin tone.  Darker, lighter, tanner, rosier, etc.|`|5s3uFazlaa	You take orange and mix a little bit of red into it, depending on what kind of orange it is.  Then mix white into the color until you reach the color that you want.  To darken slightly, if the color is too orange, mix a little bit of gray...but really little.  If this does not work, because of the shades of acrylic you are using, you might just have to buy a "flesh" colored paint at the craft store.|`|FXP2pnlJaa	I would mix some orange (if you have it) and white. If you don't have orange, mix red, yellow and white. :)|`|kXCgQoYLaa	Start with white, then a touch of yellow and red; go easy now!
zBr9MSY7aa	The tuning would be a half step up, I don't recommend doing this because you may snap your strings.  Just buy a capo|`|TLzknS0eaa	Forget about snapping your strings;think what it will do to your neck down the road. Capo all the way. If you do capo the first fret your OPEN notes will be F,A#,D#,G#,C,F|`|lgMshdofaa	thats not a good idea to do...you would have to tune it up half a step, I suggest you go buy  a Kyser Capo|`|W1h3w5gdaa	The notes will be as follows:<br>  <br>  String 1 - F<br>  String 2 - C<br>  String 3 - G#<br>  String 4 - D#<br>  String 5 - A#<br>  String 6 - F<br>  <br>  (String 1 is the skinny string, and string 6 is the fat one.)<br>  <br>  Now, to make a few corrections: tuning everything a half step up will not snap your strings. It will not damage your neck (unless your guitar is absolute garbage-heap junk.) It may raise your action (distance between the strings and the fretboard) and make things more difficult to play. <br>  <br>  If so, most likely your guitar neck has something called a truss rod in it, which can be adjusted to compensate for the raised action. I don't recommend adjusting it yourself; take it to a professional luthier and expect them to take a few days. Truss rod adjustments are very minor, and take a few days for the wood in the neck to relax into position.<br>  <br>  All that being said, no song "requires" a capo, period. You can always barre the first fret and play the chords with your remaining fingers. This is really, really, really hard to do, even for experienced players, but it is possible. <br>  <br>  Your other option is to transpose the chords. For example, if a song is in capo 1 and the chords are E, A, and D, then the chords without a capo would just be F, B-flat, and E-flat. <br>  <br>  And finally, you can just ignore the capo part and play the song a half-step lower than it's written. No harm, no foul.<br>  <br>  Enjoy!|`|AA12136206	I agree with Woody; that will put more tension on your strings than they can handle, and you are likely to snap one of them, especially the G, B, or high E.  A cheap capo is under $10.  Or you could just play it without the capo.  You'll be down a half-step, it will work fine unless you're trying to play along with the recording.  Or, you could transpose every chord up a half-step and play it in the new key without the capo.  Lots of options for you.|`|YMehaPY5aa	EBGDAE flat<br>  <br>  They are all flats.|`|YO3DTDHraa	just buy a $5.00 capo. or are you trying to play the song in open chords? you know, g,c,d, etc without all the hard finerings of 5th's and 7th's and stuff? what song? i'm a cheater. i hardly ever play a song just like the real deal. i may know it or be able to tell you the "open-chord" progression. eithrt way, good luck!|`|bZFIZMIwaa	Make a homemade capo by using a pencil and rubber bands. You can google it if you want to.

It's not my intent to be mean, because I admire that you have the guts to post yourself singing a capella on the Internet. I'm a professional musician and I don't think I'd ever do that. Props to you on that.<br>  <br>  Seek out teachers who specialize in voice coaching and get an honest assessment of your potential, and an estimate of how much work it will take to get where you want to go. Best of luck (and I hope you go for it!)|`|DheJq6RJaa	It looks like you really enjoy singing so keep doing it! It is one of those things where if you don't know how to sing in tune it is impossible to learn (i don't wanna be harsh i feel so mean sorry.)

enLLBqHlaa	Mother I have to say I enjoyed reading this story. First Nessie and then you. I think I am missing out on the fun of writing. <br>  <br>  But instead of writing (I'll leave it to you and Nessie for that) I'll review it: <br>  <br>  I think you captured me well. It's pretty sad and I liked the whole relationship I had with Edward there. (Speaking of Edward I wonder where he is....he promised to hang out today D:< lol) <br>  <br>  There are a few grammar mistakes, but don't worry about it. Just keep writing and then you can go back and edit or whatever you want. Keep going with it Esme ^.^<br>  <br>  Also you don't have to contact Stephenie Meyer about it. This is fanfiction. As long as you write a disclaimer that you don't own anything it'll be fine.<br>  Go on <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.fanfiction.net</a> and if you want I say make an account and then you can publish your stories there. You can get reviews for it too ^.^|`|kf4u0sClaa	Hello Esme,<br>  <br>  I am happy to see that all is well with you! Send my regards to your family.

Surely write more!<br>  <br>  Renata|`|RBpNtzjHaa	i will read it, but i gotta say..i love fan fiction from the cullens POV not just edward or bellas.. its nice to see what others think of the relationship who are not involved w/ all the mushy feelings. I wanna read one from Emmetts POV since he cracks me up|`|MkmorJEeaa	i think that it is worth writing but does Stephanie know that you are making a book based on the series that she wrote if she doesn't then she might get really mad that you are doing that|`|jBOZfs9Qaa	Not bad Esme!

9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	cite<br>   I guess you would have to define "traditional" as the group photos posed for weddings are very much like the posed group photos of other events and there is lots of other types of photography.  In fact, it would be fair to say that the informality of snap shot photography and casual unposed journalistic photography had revised how weddings are shot with people expecting more situational recording and less posing.

dd2df7fc5cba9f11d754885dd4f51a59aa	I would estimate thousands or hundreds of thousands. It is what many people call "muscle memory". You do not learn the notes, but instead learn where your fingers are meant to be. Each note is a consequence of what went before so with a rigorous training regime you do not have to be a genius in remembering things - practice makes perfect!|`|UsTyc0oeaa	There are only eight notes.  It is remembering the order in which to play them that the difficulty arises.|`|0tGXQQ1zaa	Well, practise helps!  Also, many parts of the piece may have repeating parts.  Chords also have three notes or more, and they just remember them after years of practise.  They also know which keys to press, just by looking at the music, like we know when to "read a question" when reading a piece of literature.|`|fQ0cQlWKaa	In music there are only seven notes-ABCDEFG. They repeat over and over, remember how the first seven line up and you've got them all.<br>  The notes are put on a staff and thats how it works. The top one has a treble {or G] cleff and contains the higher notes. The bottom one is the Bass {of F] cleff and contains the lower notes. After you play for a while you start to see patterns in the music and patterns within certain styles. It's just a matters of transferring information from your eyes to your fingers.|`|yZwERueKaa	well, as a pianist, it takes a lot of practice. it is really hard to remember, and it takes a while to memorize so many notes. i've had to memorize two songs at once, and they had at least 1000 notes each. but, like i said, it takes a lot of practice|`|rh5vbol9aa	It likes as cycling!

82359ab5eb2bec5d95da9132c032f006aa	This southern Italian variation of the ROSSI surname which means "red-haired or ruddy-complexioned individual."

S266hHH6aa	Bangladesh and Pakistan were part of India. Muslims in India wanted to separate and govern their own region which resulted in the formation of Pakistan (Bangladesh was known as East Pakistan). If you look at the geography of the 3 countries, you notice India is in the middle separating Pakistan and Bangladesh. East Pakistan was unhappy and wanted to become their own country. Although majority were Muslims as well, they felt the governing body was too far away from their region, felt they were different from Pakistan and the official language of Pakistan was not their main language. East Pakistan went to war against main Pakistan to get their freedom. It was bloody but eventually they won.<br>  <br>  Every year they have a large celebration known as Mother Language Day to commemorate their freedom and the ability to speak their own national language, Bengali.|`|AA10729675	I do not know about the history of Bangladesh, but as a linguist I can tell you that a language is the representation of a country.  It is a statement.  Sometimes a statement of independence, or of rebellion, or of a great separation from a controlling state or country.  For instance, in India, you have more than 1000 dialects, which reflects the desire of India to keep a diversity.<br>  <br>  I will elaborate in a few hours.  Please give me the time I need.

W1h3w5gdaa	There are many, many techniques that can assist with rhythmic issues. First things first, however. Does your heart ever beat at a regular rhythm? The answer to this is almost assuredly "yes," and this means you actually DO have a sense of rhythm. It's hard-coded into your DNA and keeps your heart doing what it needs to do!<br>  <br>  The challenge is tapping into your innate sense of rhythm and translating that into kinetic reactions in your fingers. The metronome is a perfect tool for this. Set it for, say, 60 BPM and pluck along with each click. These are called quarter notes. Then, leave it at 60 BPM, but increase to two evenly-spaced plucks per click (PPC). These are eighth notes. Finally, increase it to 4 PPC, and you'll be playing 16th notes, which is standard scale speed.<br>  <br>  Once you're comfortable with 16th notes, start increasing your metronome speed VERY gradually. Go to 64, then 68, 72, 76, 80 and so on but do NOT practice at a speed higher than you can keep up with. If you start to lose the beat, back off on your speed until you can hold the beat. Let the speed come naturally.<br>  <br>  From there, you can start experimenting with different grooves because your fingers will be conditioned to play at a steady rhythm and will fight you if you start to go off-beat.<br>  <br>  This will only get you started, however. You really need to get a professional instructor. There is no substitute.

fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	I seriously doubt the "sustainable level" claim. In Roman times slaves were taken from the coasts of North Africa- eg from the black Numidian tribes who lived in present day Tunisia as well as from the Nubians who inhabited southern Egypt. This status quo ends with the spread of Islam- the Numidians vanish completely and the Nubians are pushed further south- their descendants live today in southern Sudan.<br>  <br>  The problem was an enormous demand for slaves from the Arab and Turkish markets- which absorbed some 95% of the African slave trade. The slaves who ended there were most often put to work in stone quarries and mines, were not allowed to reproduce and died rather quickly. The factor was the relaitive cheapness of black slaves in Arab and Turkish markets- most were taken as war booty during "Jihad" (eg this was the only booty worth taking in the raids made by muslims against the Ethiopian Empire)<br>  <br>  About 5% of the black slaves ended up transported in ships across the Atlantic- the problem there was that the ships had limited space (while a column of walking slaves does not have such limitations)<br>  <br>  A second factor is the spread of diseases. For example after the muslims established a "sultanate" in the area of present day Uganda and started raiding across the Congo, they brought with them Sleeping Sickness- an illness which is endemic (and mostly harmless) in East Africa but was until then unknown in West Africa (the carrying vector were the horses of the slave traders). The end result was mass infections and loss of life.<br>  <br>  A third factor was the "Jihad" character of the late slave trade- they not only wanted to "harvest" slaves but also to "make room" for the spread of Islam- which means that all those who did not "qualify" as able bodied enough to walk back to the market (and carry the loot as well) were killed on the spot- so an area raided once was depopulated. These methods become extremely common in the "Mahdi" era - most of the inland slave traders came from Sudan (the East coast was dominated by Zanzibar) and that is also where their slaves were sent.|`|UR08cIOOaa	They found two new continents that were not as densely populated as Europe.  <br>  <br>  The crops that were prevalent at the time were labor intensive.<br>  <br>  It was more cost effective to use slave labor as paid labor.

The energy that keeps everything together  -  I have thought of this one too as it is the only way that I am able to transpose the idea of a god for myself - Its actually the only way that I can manage to sing hymns at funerals and weddings by imagining something that I can accept.<br>  <br>  But that too is only a construction and only for the purposes of connection to others. For myself if there is indeed an energy holding everything together why would I name it god and make it more special than any other energy  - rather than 'gravity' or some other word. Seems like whenever we designate something as god it gets ringfenced and you cannot question it or examine it - it gets given power over.<br>  <br>  The place I transpose to most often is that god is the whole including my self but then philosophical taoism does that for me without god.<br>  <br>  I used to think about this as a child and would get to the point where my brain cave in on me and then I would say "I don't know!" and start to feel instantly  a lot better and peaceful  - I learned then that honesty with myself not trying to superimpose stories that dont fit was bliss indeed and I love that place of 'I don't know'.|`|5Ynm0bBraa	God is what you make it.

We are all wrong.  What we believe is our reality.  No one has the same reality, even if they believe in the same concepts.<br>  <br>  The whole God concept is so convoluted that it is getting to be too heavy to hold true.  There has been speculation about God since man first became aware of himself.  You can't have 6 billion people on the planet and not have 6 billion different interpretations of who created us.<br>  <br>  My belief is that we are thought energy that uses waves and frequencies to create our reality.  We are all connected and there are many complicated levels that make up our earthly reality.<br>  <br>  A rock is solid, but if you observe it on a molecular level, it is vibrating so fast and that is what makes it solid.  So if we can slow our minds down and observe the rock on that level, can we pass our had through it?  If you could do that would people think you a God?  The concept of a God is based on explaining the unknown.  Once you know more, it lessens the mysteries of life.  So once people are able to do things that are associated with God and Jesus, will that affect religion?<br>  <br>  I know psychic people and people with all kinds of gifts.  A lot of these people are scared of being persecuted, so they hide what they can do.  The first time I told my sister, who is a minister, that I could hear spiritual guides, she equated it to evil.  I wondered why people who read about these spiritual visitations in the Bible are so quick to call this kind of communication evil?<br>  <br>  I guess because I know I'm not talking to God, but a form of energy that I have always been attached to, but have only been conscious of in the last 11 years, I'm not fearful.  I know what is in my heart, so no evil can touch me unless I decide that I want it too.  We all have choices and free will, so no matter what I hear, I make up my own mind to how I act upon the information.  I had the balls to ask about God and I was told that humans don't get that they are already connected to the energy they seek.  They just have to open the line and recieve the information to fulfill their goals they set for themselves when they were incarnated.<br>  <br>  All the emotions equated to God are man made.  We are the emotions of the whole.  We are the way the energy people call God puts thought into action.  We are the testing ground.  We are the mistakes and what works in the thoughts of those who created us.  But we are a part of the planning process too.  We choose who we are and the major events that drive our lives.  The guidence is just there to try to steer us toward our goals.  In the end, we are the classroom that energy uses to figure every aspect of everything that ever could be.  That is my belief.|`|Z8E8nTXSaa	i honestly got confused by ur story...sorry! but i know and beleive that God is real and he cares for us and guides us...he does not persecute us---but the devil(Satan) does. When we disobey God we slip out of his provision and into a state where Satan can attack us every which way possible...and only when we turn back to God are we safe...we will all mess up and will have consequences but we need to know that they are not from God but from the Devil....God is not the maker of death and depression--but Satan is! god created this world to be a safe haven for us to  live as one with Him but then satan came, tempted adam and eve, and ruined it....but then God sent Jesus so that we may have life through Him and live as one, as we were created to! And if God gave his son that shows that he loves us and doesn't wnat us to be hurt by the evil in this world....i know that God is here and is very much an emotional person/being...he is saddened when we are hurt, and glad when we are happy, he is upset when we disobey but joyful when we obey! those are emotions...i know we cant see him but i know he is there...take a look aroung you...the trees, the people, the wind, the rain, the sky, the clouds, the grass, the animals....everything! do u rly think some BANG! could do all of that!!??!?!?!? i dont! it took an almighty God...the one and only God...not buhda...not muhammad...it took God.....and i beleive in Him!

What would it look like if one did not exist?|`|F5bT2wAraa	It is nice that you meditate.  You will find the answer if you are sincere.  A force or energy alone can not be unifying.  A force alone brings disharmony.  You can not love a Force.  For love you need two persons and they are both happy.  A personality brings harmony if it is not based on just humans speculation.  God can have a form as you and I can.

Qinwb7rEaa	First of all, you are not acting "crazy", thought that's what people want you to think. It is a natural feeling to want to fit in, or brush problems under the rug. Trust me, I know. Your story sounds very similar to mine, before I realize that I wasn't the problem--other people were. Not to say that your friends don't care, but they don't understand, or know how to deal with the magnitude of what you are telling them. My problem, personally was being bipolar. You may not be the same, but it is a possibility. Despite my "diagnosis", I realized that there is NOTHING wrong with me, or you, for that matter. I suggest you research manic depression and bipolar disease, not to "cure" you, as people might think, but to help you manage your emotions with diet and lifestyle changes. It is not normal to want to take your own life, but it is not normal to ignore your own feelings either. Another option is reaching out to others like yourself. DO NOT think that you are limited to friends who attend the same school as you. The internet (social networks such as myspace and twitter), allow you to reach out to people similar to yourself across the world. Do not let anyone tell you what you are feeling is wrong or "everything will be ok", without them offering solutions. <br>  ~Jamal and Jasmine Rose<br>  unworldlife.com|`|M8HVkIikaa	Hey girl,<br>  You sound young..like 12 or 13. but<br>  You know you can control it.

I mean, I would love to play him in the movies, cause I just love his character so much, but i still kinda think he was cruel to harry all those years, and i can't really see any one totally forgiving him for being a death eater.

j5Apt8hWaa	When looking through the viewfinder be aware of two things 1) that the focusing screen is in sharp focus ... if not you will either have to wear your glasses (if you need corrective lenses) or contacts, or add a diopter to the viewfinder eye piece or 2) look in the center of the focusing screen and make sure that the center circle is clear.  If it is at all fuzzy, the lens is out of focus.  This will assure that your images are in focus.  Blur on the other hand is a result of using too slow a shutter speed to prevent camera movement during the exposure .. Since you are new at using a fully adjustable camera, make sure you are holding the camera correctly and the shutter speed is at least at 1/250 of a second until you learn how to hold the camera steady during exposures.<br>  <br>   Both the recommended way to hold your camera and an illustration of the focusing screen are on page 9 of your owners manual <br>  <br>  Link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mcfaddenphoto.com/camera_manuals/img/k1000_9.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://mcfaddenphoto.com/camera_manuals/...</a>

Ow3O7h4caa	From the way you are explaining it, IT MAY NOT NEED A FRET JOB. I doubt it verrrrrrrryyyyy much.  The fact that you say that it buzzes from the 5th to the 12th is about right.<br>  <br>  Here is what you do. Put .009 extra light gauge or light gauge .010, which you decide.<br>  Now, place the guitar on your lap and press the 1st fret with the index finger of the left hand and the 12 th fret with the other hand. Their should be a clearance of about 1/16" at the 7th fret.<br>  <br>  In your case, the string probably touches. And if you want to double check, but your eye at the head stock, hold the 1st fret with one hand & the 12th fret and look towards the middle of the neck and I bet you the neck is bowed and the strings are touching.<br>  <br>  What you need to do first BEFORE touching any frets, is a truss rod adjustment which is TOO TIGHT. You need to loosen the truss rod by turning counter-clockwise 1/4 to 1/2 turn. This will release the neck and you should see an immediate difference.<br>  When you get the clearance of 1/16" between stirng and fingerboard, you are done and ready to play and no buzzing. That is how sure I am.<br>  <br>  I can understand one bad fret but 14 of them. no way. The person probably left the guitar untuned which caused the neck to bow backward.<br>  Basically, decide on the gauge (i suggest light gauge) and then check the neck. <br>  Whatever you do, don't play with the frets. It needs a truss rod adjustment and will solve your problem.<br>  <br>  Just a note that Gibson classic use a good nickel fret and lasts for 30 years easily.|`|MgDWlJJcaa	i haven't gotten any that bad. but that sounds pretty bad...|`|xUuqcKWoaa	a luither can re level the fret height for about 100 $ as well as anything else that is wrong.

He has a fun read called Six Lessons of Acting.<br>  <br>  Uta Hagen is also a major disciple of Stanislavsky. She is usually not considered part of the Big 3 (Adler, Meisner, Strasberg) because her technique is very similar to Strasberg in that it involves emotional memory and substitution.

I highly recommend No Acting Please and Irreverant Acting.<br>  <br>  Milton Katselas was the founder of the Beverly Hills Playhouse and a very influential teacher. He unfortunately passed away in October 2008. He has a good book now available to the public called Acting Class:Take a Seat<br>  <br>  William Esper is one of Meisner's greatest disciples. He has a really good book on the subject of Meisner's branch of American Method acting.<br>  <br>  Margie Haber is the author of How to Get the Part Without Falling Apart. She's the founder of one of the BEST cold reading schools in the country. Students have included Brad Pitt, Halle Berry, Heather Locklear, Masi Oka, etc.<br>  <br>  Larry Moss is a big Stella Adler and Meinser disciple. He has a really great book called Intent to Live.

W1h3w5gdaa	Well, it's in the key of C#m as far as I can tell, which is the relative minor for E-major.<br>  <br>  At the beginning guitar part it's a finger-picked C#5 two-octave arpeggio with a minor scale walk-up on the root note. <br>  <br>  Which is just a concise way of saying it starts with a C# on the 6th string (9th fret) and plays a G# on the 5th string, another C# on th 4th string, another G# on the 3rd string, then back to the 4th, 5th, then goes up to D# on string 6, repeats string pattern 5-4-3-4-5, string 6 changes to E, repeats pick pattern, 6th goes to F#, then the whole thing starts back over on C#.<br>  <br>  The next part seems to alternate equally between C#m and B-major. Some finger-picked arpeggio stuff going on there, too, but really you could improvise that and it would sound fine.<br>  <br>  This is really hard to explain in prose, but I do have the chords correct.

AA11942204	On January 15, 1842 Mary MacKillop was born of Scottish parents, Alexander MacKillop and Flora MacDonald in Fitzroy, Victoria. This was less than seven years after Faulkner sailed up the Yarra, when Elizabeth Street was a deep gully and Lonsdale Street was still virgin bush. A plaque in the footpath now marks the place of her birth in Brunswick Street, Fitzroy. <br>  <br>  Mary, the eldest of eight children, was well educated by her father who spent some years studying for the priesthood in Rome but through ill health had returned to his native Scotland until 1835 when he migrated to Australia with his parents. Unfortunately, he lacked financial awareness, so the family was often without a home of their own, depending on friends and relatives and frequently separated from one another.<br>  <br>  From the age of sixteen, Mary earned her living and greatly supported her family, as a governess, as a clerk for Sands and Kenny (now Sands and MacDougall), and as a teacher at the Portland school. While acting as a governess to her uncle's children at Penola, Mary met Father Julian Tenison Woods who, with a parish of 22,000 square miles/56,000 square kilometres, needed help in the religious education of children in the outback. At the time Mary's family depended on her income so she was not free to follow her dream. However, in 1866, greatly inspired and encouraged by Father Woods, Mary opened the first Saint Joseph's School in a disused stable in Penola.<br>  <br>  Young women came to join Mary, and so the Congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph was begun. In 1867, Mary was asked by Bishop Shiel to come to Adelaide to start a school. From there, the Sisters spread, in groups to small outback settlements and large cities around Australia, New Zealand, and now in Peru, Brazil and refugee camps of Uganda and Thailand. Mary and these early Sisters, together with other Religious Orders and Lay Teachers of the time, had a profound influence on the forming of Catholic Education as we have come to know and experience it today. She also opened Orphanages, Providences to care for the homeless and destitute both young and old, and Refuges for ex-prisoners and ex-prostitutes who wished to make a fresh start in life.<br>  <br>  Throughout her life, Mary met with opposition from people outside the Church and even from some of those within it. In the most difficult of times she consistently refused to attack those who wrongly accused her and undermined her work, but continued in the way she believed God was calling her and was always ready to forgive those who wronged her.<br>  <br>  Throughout her life Mary suffered ill health. She died on August 8, 1909 in the convent in Mount Street, North Sydney where her tomb is now enshrined. Since then the Congregation has grown and now numbers about 1200, working mainly in Australia and New Zealand but also scattered singly or in small groups around the world. The "Brown Joeys" may be seen in big city schools, on dusty bush tracks, in modern hospitals, in caravans, working with the "little ones" of God - the homeless, the new migrant, the Aboriginal, the lonely and the unwanted, in direct care and in advocacy, in standing with and in speaking with. In their endeavours to reverence the human dignity of others and to change unjust structures, the Sisters and those many others who also share the Mary MacKillop spirit continue the work which she began.<br>  <br>  This great Australian woman inspired great dedication to God's work in the then new colonies. In today's world, she stands as an example of great courage and trust in her living out of God's loving and compassionate care of those in need.

DW7J8huQaa	First, you need to finish the book so that it is polished as best as it can be.  No grammatical errors, spelling errors, etc.  Proofread it yourself, don't rely on spell check!  There and their are both spelled correctly, but can be an error. <br>  <br>  Then, you research agents in your genre, research their submission requirements, and query them individually based on those requirements.  No mass e-mail submissions!  No paper submissions if they only accept e-queries!  Don't send your whole manuscript if all they want is a query letter!<br>  <br>  Work on your query letter.  It is harder than you think to write it.  Look for examples.  Practice.  If you only get one piece of paper to pitch your whole book, you want it done perfectly.<br>  <br>  Then, if an agent signs you, they will help pitch it to a publisher.  The agent only makes money if the publisher buys the book, and then they get 15% commission based on what you earn.  Do not pay an agent reading fees or anything else up front.  <br>  <br>  The publisher pays you an advance against sales of the book.  If they are paying you $1 per book sold, and they expect to sell 5,000 books, you will get a $5,000 advance.  After 5,000 books sell, you get $1 per book, given to you in a royalty statement.  First time authors usually get around $5,000 to $10,000 in an advance.  <br>  <br>  Don't publish online.  Don't self-publish.  Both of these things advertise to the buying customer that a publisher did not like your book.  Since publishers usually pick the best sellers, if they reject you, why should a customer buy your book?  It is very, very rare that anyone published by any means other than the aforementioned one will become a best seller or make any money.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|UaCqYFKnaa	If you are looking for self-publishing companies to publish your book, I know of a few companies that practically holds court to everything a book needs from getting you your copyright, size preferences, book cover design customization, layout consultation, copyediting and even marketing – at affordable costs.<br>  <br>  The difference with self-publishing is that you happen to send in your materials to the publisher and they will do all the work for you depending on which program you are on. Publishing packages are very affordable and investing on getting your book published is a good start.<br>  <br>  Most self-publishing companies have programs that costs about $250 to $12999 and is highly dependent on the kind of services that you will be getting which is why it is very significant to carefully map out your book's budget as early as now.<br>  <br>  Publishing companies now have all the resources to publish books with the same productivity and efficacy as that of regular black and white books. Considering the fact that most books are in full color, you should choose a publishing company whose book’s are of the highest quality, bar none. <br>  <br>  How you are getting paid is largely dependent on the your royalties and the percentage of how much your book is going to be sold in the market. <br>  <br>  Say for example, your book is sold at $10 each - you perhaps get 15% of it, the rest goes to the printing costs, etc.|`|koxTRXH2aa	Getting an agent is definitely the best way to go.<br>  If they want you to pay up front,it;s a scam<br>  You don't pay an agent until after they get your book published|`|vF7HO9xGaa	go to a publishers or try and get someone to read it. put it on a website <br>  (people get famous via the internet. eg-lily allen)|`|AgrVuahYaa	There's the old standby.  You go to the library, check out a book on finding a literary agent, write a query letter, and wait and wait and wait.  This is the traditional way but it's frustrating, takes time, and is not always productive.  You'll receive lots of rejection letters.  I recently self-published my own book (agents didn't want it because they figured I was going to get sued and they didn't want the liability) through iUniverse.com  It cost me about $500.00 but it got the project off the ground quickly.  Getting the book published is the easy part; a marketing strategy is where I'm stuck.  I'm trying to boost sales over the internet, etc.  Lots of work.  Good luck.  Self-publishing used to be the "kiss of death" for writers, but now with speedy technology, your book can be in your hands (and hopefully the hands of others) in short order.  Feel free to check out my website at www.carolebarker.com.  I did it myself--and you can too!  It's hard work--especially for someone with no experience--but if I can do it, so can you!  (BTW: I strongly disagree with the previous writer--my book got Reader's Choice through iUniverse--new times--new rules.)|`|McuWTmpvaa	if u read it out loud|`|wYF6U6qlaa	I think 10% is pretty average for an agent.  The publishing house usually pays a lump advance, and then if your book sells over a specific number of copies, then you earn royalties on each book sold.  The royalties are a percentage of the sale price - perhaps 5%? <br>  <br>  If your publishing company feels it would be a lucrative move to release the rights to your book to paperback, they might do so, resulting in another (lesser) lump advance and additional (lesser) royalties.<br>  <br>  <br>  The most important thing about publishing is to educate yourself thoroughly about the process.  If you do this, target the people who deal in your subject material, and write reasonably well, you'll be ahead of about 70% of authors that submit to agents every day.  However, if you're serious, you really need more information than one could type in this forum.  Begin with learning about the process of querying an agent.|`|8asG4WCwaa	Do you want you book in stores nationswide?  Do you want to be paid for your work?  Do you want someone else to market and distribute it without costing you any money to do it?  Do you want to be taken seriously as an author?  Then you should traditionally publish, and it;s advisable to get an agent to help you.<br>  <br>  Do you only want a few copies for yourself, your friends, and your family? Do you want to pay someone to print your work?  Pay to market it or have to do it yourelf?  Have few stores willing to carry it? To not be taken seriously as an author?  Then self publish.<br>  <br>  Self publishing has a bad reputation in the industry for a reason.  You should do your research before you decide which publishing model to use (traditional or vanity).<br>  <br>  Traditional publishers pay an advance - that is the percent of the cover price (best) or net price (worst) of a book times the minimal expected sales.  Say the book is $10, it's expected to sell 1000 copies, and your royallty rate is 10%, you would get an advance of $1000.  If you sell more than 1000 copies, you earn out the advance and will start earning your 10% royalties of each book sold after that.  It's more complicated than that, but that's the basic idea.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  There is nothing impressive about winning an award from the publisher who published your work, Carole.  It's another marketing "trick" self publishers use a lot. Industry professionals and well informed readers are not swayed by these meaningless awards.  <br>  <br>  Proof is in the pudding, not the box it's packaged in.<br>  <br>  Many self publishers give out such awards only to those authors who purchased the more expensive printing packages.  This encourages the author to continue the relationship and print their next book with the same company.  They again buy the more expensive options, and, surprise, win another award.
VPlKbDplaa	In England and Wales, stillborn children weren't registered until 1927.

I was told that stillbirths are registered in a separate Stillbirths Register which is not open to the public and I would have to make a special application for details.  I was told that the reason for this is because it might cause "distress".  I was puzzled by this because surely it is more distressing to have a living child die young, but these are all listed in the indexes which are open to the public.  My mother told me that their main reaction was relief that they would not have the worry of another mouth to feed, and that the only person "distressed" was me (I was five years old and hoping for a little sister).<br>  <br>  Therefore I think the answer to your question is "no".  You would have to register the stillbirth and would get a Stillbirth Certificate (which would be a combined birth and death certificate), and this would enable you to arrange the burial.|`|c06f9e62b2e3de70492245a069ccbf6aaa	UK answer.<br>  As of July 1st 1837 all life events had to be registered.

I am unsure when the Register for the Stillborn baby came into force, but like Steffi ? said this is a register that only the parents or their living children (when both parents are deceased) are privy too..

eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	Klan members adopted masks and robes that hid their identities and added to the drama of their night rides, their chosen time for attacks. Many of them operated in small towns and rural areas where people otherwise knew each other's faces, and sometimes still recognized the attackers. "The kind of thing that men are afraid or ashamed to do openly, and by day, they accomplish secretly, masked, and at night." With this method both the high and the low could be attacked.[19] The Ku Klux Klan night riders "sometimes claimed to be ghosts of Confederate soldiers so, as they claimed, to frighten superstitious blacks. Few freedmen took such nonsense seriously."[20][21]<br>  <br>  The Klan attacked black members of the Loyal Leagues and intimidated southern Republicans and Freedmen's Bureau workers. When they killed black political leaders, they also took heads of families, along with leaders of churches and community groups, because people had many roles. Agents of the Freedmen's Bureau reported weekly assaults and murders of blacks. "Armed guerilla warfare killed thousands of Negroes; political riots were staged; their causes or occasions were always obscure, their results always certain: ten to one hundred times as many Negroes were killed as whites." Masked men shot into houses and burned them, sometimes with the occupants still inside. They drove successful black farmers off their land. Generally, it Canby reported that in North and South Carolina, in 18 months ending in June 1867, there were 197 murders and 548 cases of aggravated assault.[22]<br>  <br>  Klan violence worked to suppress black voting. As examples, over 2,000 persons were killed, wounded and otherwise injured in Louisiana within a few weeks prior to the Presidential election of November 1868. Although St. Landry Parish had a registered Republican majority of 1,071, after the murders, no Republicans voted in the fall elections. White Democrats cast the full vote of the parish for Grant's opponent. The KKK killed and wounded more than 200 black Republicans, hunting and chasing them through the woods. Thirteen captives were taken from jail and shot; a half-buried pile of 25 bodies was found in the woods.

If your group member says you have a fish on your head, you have a fish on your head. If you deny something it will ruin the improv therefore making you stumble for things to say. Big tip:Go with the flow, keep the show on the go.

So I guess my advise is just to have fun.|`|rgzaqHqnaa	Look, I do improv in my drama class at school all of the time. At first it was scary but now its my fave(besides doing plays)!

It is supposed to be fun! There is no true way that you can mess up in improv because there are no lines to memorize. People are more likely to laugh at you because you are frozen than anything else(unless you are in antarctica). Be Brave. Real life is just like improv. You have to figure out what you are gonna say, you don't have lines! So just think of it as real life and add some entertainment in the group. Don't be scared to be silly if they laugh, they'll get over it. Acting is fun and if you try you'll get better. Go get 'em tiger and don't quit until you're great!

Not just you but a lot of people have people trying to 'undermine' them. This is usually through jealousy. These envious people operate by finding a weakness and then 'exploiting' it, that is, driving a wedge between you and what your mind knows to be true, thus making you insecure. If you are thinking of singing in front of people who have already 'given you the wedge' then you need a lot of rehearsal, because repetition can give you a hypnotic like confidence. If you re singing in front of people who don't know you then just go ahead - they have no expectation of you.|`|Pfi47eIQaa	your moms a pig and shess just jealous that she sounds like a duck and that youre awesome :)<br>  <br>  i am the exact same way and really all i care about is what people think but you really shouldnt. you need to be yourself and sing your heart out, no matter what anyone thinks.<br>  <br>  i say you that you go to that show and do whatever it takes to get over your fear of people. its a once in a school year chance i bet, so take advantage when you have one !|`|W1h3w5gdaa	Your own mother said you sound like a duck??

You'll get the initial willies and butterflies out of the way.<br>  <br>  The more you practice, the more confident you'll feel and probably this will make you less self-conscious.

NjYCvfYGaa	Don't listen to these guys.<br>  Writing it out is something you do last.<br>  <br>  First of all read through the script a couple times, and really read it not just look at the words. Read through every single word and know what each character is trying to portray. The best way for you to remember lines is to read EVERY line, not just yours. Look at what each character is trying to portray or say so you can know how to respond to it in a certain way. Keep reading and studying it. Get into character as well, that helps you connect with the character. Once you read them oh so many times they're already in your head, once you're completely in character and you forget your lines just keep going, they'll come to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|k4bBqQHWaa	I learn things in chunks.

zHuqakJsaa	I think this is a really good opening to your story, but I do think it can be improved.    I think the key area for improvement, for me, would be the mother's entrance.  It might be worth playing around with doing it in a couple of different ways.     Perhaps you could build up to it more.  I get the impression that your aim is to build tension and to create a sense that Elizabeth is in some far off world of her own.  You perhaps need to take more time to build an image of this place/feeling in the reader's mind.      You could also think about the mother's opening phrase.  It might have more of an impact if she were to simply call Elizabeth's name.    I also think you could create more effect if you didn't have Elizabeth stating "You gave me a terrible fright".  Show the reader that she gave her a terrible fright without simply stating it.  What does she do as a result of being shocked?  How does it pull her out of her dream world?  It could be more effective if you completely cut out the part where Elizabeth is talking to her Mother and go from '...journey was not yet complete... to 'your father is running late this evening'.  This would perhaps create the feeling that although Elizabeth has been pulled from her daydream, she is still not 100% with her mother.  It would leave us with a sense that she was a lot more absorbed in her fantasy.    "I jumped off hastily out of the small dingy" - I also think this phrase needs work.  You could either "jump off hastily" or "jump hastily out" of the dingy.      I'm an English teacher and I see a lot of writing from 15 year olds.  Some good.  Some bad.  Some ugly!!  I would be thrilled to have a piece like this turned in by one of my students!      Good luck with the rest of the book.  It's wonderful to see a 15 year old with such ambition!|`|vFF5vwqsaa	Okay, this is 100 years ago?

You might pick another word instead of "healthy" for your breeze. And your 2nd paragraph doesn't work exactly right. A bird doesn't really crash to earth. Of course, metaphorically, describing yourself as a bird is fine. I like it about your journey not being complete. And I like the rest. It is a fine effort. Keep it coming.|`|tQu9THuTaa	I like it , but I don't understand this bit  "Like a bird, which had found his destination, I came crashing back down to earth, to reality". Birds don't crash when they find what they're looking for, they land. I think using another metaphor would be more effective. Also, the bird should be an "it" not a "he".    Also, the "but" here doesn't make sense :"She barely uttered a word but trudged us up the sloping paths in near silence"     Maybe change it to "She barely uttered a word , trudging us up the sloping paths in near silence.|`|Lq9tBgdaaa	Consider a job at McDonalds.|`|Mf6fxWM7aa	ooh- i like!  i dont have any improvements (i'm not good at that) but this is quite good =)|`|N4JUrdbsaa	(Whistles) I like it. Being that I have a passion for writing as well, it is easy to critique your skill, though I'm no professional author.    You are good at descriptions, and the idea of who the character is personality-wise is easily realized. However, the story itself seemed to be...lacking. Even though it was only the beginning, it doesn't do much to hook the reader. I'd get the book if I read this, but I can see why others wouldn't.

872f4d28837b0b839ed695238bef2e97aa	I believe in the singularity, it is undeniable that inventions and discoveries are coming faster and faster.  A few decades ago we passed a very important landmark, the point where inventions are coming so fast that children live a very different life than their parents did, and the generation gap was introduced.  I think we will see more social changes like that one as we approach it.    But i don't believe that the singularity will be brought by self-improving artificial intelligence that will take our place.  My own research strongly suggests that artificial intelligence is impossible and i'm rather convinced that as we approach the singularity we will find proof of that.  Researchers of strong A.I. can't even define the word intelligence.    I believe the mysteries of this universe are only finite and the singularity will be the point when all questions are answered, all sciences will stand completed.  What makes it more interesting is that it's very likely that the singularity will be reached at the same time as the biosphere finally dies, along with the last humans.|`|7e7002b6150c8c3eae2926c9baf2be5daa	I don't know about the 'useless' part, but I think that some type of synergy will take place.

I highly recommend the Shopaholic series, starting with 'Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic'.  It's been made into a film which I think is coming out soon.     Lastly, Jane Green 'The Other Woman', Belinda Jones 'The Paradise Room' and 'The Waitress' by Mellissa Nathan are also alright for a rainy, Sunday afternoon.

LVZdzPmpaa	The best advice I can offer with regard to writing is to read. Read a lot in the genre that you are most interested in writing. Watch how dialogue is used, how it is written and what it does to drive the story.    Eavesdrop. Sit in coffee shops and other public places and listen to conversations. How do real people talk to one another?    Keep in mind, though, that all the dialogue in a story should have a purpose. I notice that a lot of novice writers will include a lot of "well," "uh," "um" and "so" in their dialogue, especially if the speakers are teens. While one or two interjections of this type may help to define the character, an entire page of "well, like, you know, like, okay so like I was going to the mall" does nothing for the story.    Every word on the page must have a purpose. That's how you can thin out your dialogue.    Some writers outline, more do not. The most successful stories are character-driven, not plot driven, so creating well-rounded believable characters is key. Putting the right words in their mouths is part of this.    Pick up a copy of "On Writing" by Stephen King. It's one of the best books on writing out there. He include a terrific section on writing dialogue.    There's no magic secret to writing believable dialogue or to making it work in the story. Writing, like any other craft or skill, is all about practice.|`|fCZKGBjBaa	Your book writing success or failure depends largely on the outlining process. Create an outstanding outline for your book and you're writing task becomes easy. You should know exactly what happens on every page before you start writing your first word.       If you think you can write your book by being spontaneously creative as you write, you're wrong. You're welcome to try, just about every novice author does. But I'd bet money it won't work for you. Create the exhaustive outline.       Your outline should consist of a series of questions: What does the library look like, how is she dressed, why does he feel so angry, what does she do when she reaches the house. It's simply easier to write in response to a question than it is to write in response to a statement.       Spend a short time writing to answer each question. Just a few minutes. You don't want this to become a protracted bunch of puff. You want real story.     Don't stop until the book is finished. There's a real tendency to stop and edit the work that you've just completed. After all, editing is a lot easier to do than the actual writing. So you can feel that you're still working, but it won't be as difficult. Don't do it! Keep writing until the book is finished.       Give yourself a period for writing and stick to that amount of time come hell or high water. Even if it's just 15 minutes a day. Initially you're just going for the discipline. Eventually you'll get the writing quality as well, but the discipline is most important factor for the completion of your work in the shortest amount of time possible.       Doing research for your book writing can be fun. But don't do it until after the book is written. If you come to a point where you've got to get a piece of information that you don't have in your head, just put down an asterisk and keep the flow of the book going. After the manuscript is finished, you can look back for all those asterisks and get just the information you need.       There are lots of other tips on writing a book and you'll find them constantly presented in the many articles of these series.|`|OjQxKGC0aa	Check out my Amazon Listmania list of best "how to" books for writing fiction:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/listman...

Most of all you need an outline, monologue, and dialogue. You have to be sure to give good details. You have to make sure you're characters are protagonist and antagonist.  That's all I could really say. There is a book On Writing By Stephen King. You could check out.  :D  xxxx|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	There are so many tips to improve writing that its hard to know where to start. Please dont take offense at how many of these are basics youve been doing for years.    Spell-check. Youd be amazed how many people skip it, or dont do it last.    Grammar check, even though most grammar checking programs are crap. Theyll help you catch obvious things like subject-verb disagreement, sentence fragments, and such.    Master punctuation. Seriously. Doing it right is a sign of professionalism. Screwing it up provides agents, editors, or publishers a valid reason to reject you.    Print it. Many writers swear they see it differently on paper, carried away from the usual writing environment and proofread or edited elsewhere.    Use is/was/are/were as little as possible. Theyre terribly weak verbs and eat up your word count. Searching for them will identify any use of passive voice, too.    Avoid other weak verbs: look, see, have, get, go, start, begin, try, make, play, take, wonder, seem, appear, and there is structure.    Use active voice. (Subject doing the verbs action to the object: Jerry tells a joke. Maria twisted the truth.) Learn to identify passive. (Subject receives the verbs action by the object: The joke is told by Jerry. The truth was twisted by Maria.) Never, ever use passive without a compelling reason.     Seek out all adverbs (start by searching for "ly" and for common ones like "very" and just) and destroy most of them, even if it means rewording the sentence. A stronger verb is better than an okay verb and an adverb, every time.    Include all five senses for the point of view character. This isnt a movie.    Make sure your reader understands a little about whether its day or night, winter or summer, desert or forest, shack or office building. Dont set any scenes in a vacuum just because the setting doesnt affect what happens.    Either present tense or past tense. Either He goes or He went--but never He is going or He was going unless the reader needs to know the activity is ongoing during something else.    Use the computer to search for "it's" and make sure every usage could be replaced with "it is" or "it has." Likewise, search for the to find theyre, there, and their. Make sure your fingers didnt override your brain, which, of course, knows the difference.    Get rid of the words that hesitate: start, begin, try, wonder, and so on. Instead of She began to run or He tries to call the cheerleader cut right to the meat of the idea: She ran. or He calls the cheerleader.    Seek underlining/italics and remove nearly all of it. The reader's ear will emphasize the right word, if you've written well. You dont get to tell your characters how to act in a novel any more than you get to tell the actors their jobs in a screenplay.    A dozen exclamation points in an entire novel is plenty. Use many and they lose all impact.    Be true to your characters, but minimize extremely strong language if possible to retain the impact inherent in the words. (But being true to your characters trumps limiting the f-bomb, so if thats how he talks or narrates, so be it.)    Double check the punctuation in dialogue, where most mistakes happen. A single overt mistake can mean rejection. Yeah, one.     Aim for about a 50:50 ratio of dialogue to exposition. Youll still be okay if it tips to 60:40 either direction.    Short paragraphs. Readers skim starting between line six and line ten, even in a sexually graphic paragraph. Dont let them.    Try to write each paragraph with 25% fewer words. Seriously. If it simply can't be done, it may be tight enough.    Reduce that. Search for the construction Subject-Verb-that-object/phrase, as in He wished that he could fly or Jason believed that he was Nero. The word that can be deleted.    Read it out loud, slowly and with a bit of enthusiasm, as if you were reading to a blind person. Youd be surprised at the awkward phrasing, crummy dialogue, and more that reveals itself this way.    Avoid the omniscient point of view (POV). In most fiction, one characters POV is used (not necessarily the protagonist, but usually) and you cannot tell the reader whats going on in anyone elses head except by their words and actions. Head-hopping guarantees rejection. Switching POVs by scene or chapter is an amateurs solution. Find other ways to impart information the POV character doesnt know to the reader.    Read. Read in the genre of the novel youre writing. Read in other genres, too. Read every day.     Be prepared for your first draft to suck mightily. Nobody said you had to show it around. Dont even show it to yourself. Instead, put it away for 2 full months. No editing, adding, or reading. During that time, you may jot yourself notes about it, and nothing else. Write something new, unrelated to the work you put away. At the end of the two months, youll see it with new eyes. Rewrite it, start to finish, incorporating whats in your notes. T

EH7G8voyaa	Jane is quiet and beautiful (not personality) she's the most mature which naturally comes from being the oldest. She appears to be a lot less smart than Elizabeth and wants the simple things in life, a husband etc. Unlike Elizabeth who, for that era was a very modern woman. Opinionated and hence the title prejudice against Darcy. She feels everyone looks down on her and her family and is naturally very defensive of them.|`|BzMQejGxaa	Read the book, you lazy person.

7ONKVbbiaa	Joe, did you mention a few days ago that your John was a son of Bushrod? <br>  You were given the 1850 census for Bushrod,which has a son John age 6. <br>  The location and date of John's death is going to be critical to you. Did he live long enough that he would have a death cert issued? <br>  I was under the assumption that you had already documented his as son to Bushrod.<br>  EDIT<br>  assuming your John is of Smith co, Tx..he is living in 1870 with parents Bushrod and Sarah (Williams). He is listed age 26. This is near "starrville". <br>  I ran Bushrod through the record pilot at familysearch.org, which brings up the original image of the 1870 census.|`|gb1BGP8xaa	Here they are in 1880<br>  Name: John Sanford <br>  Home in 1880: District 339, Telfair, Georgia <br>  Age: 46 <br>  Estimated Birth Year: abt 1834 <br>  Birthplace: Georgia <br>  Relation to Head of Household: Self (Head) <br>  Spouse's Name: Martha <br>  Father's birthplace: Georgia <br>  Mother's birthplace: Georgia <br>  <br>  Marital Status: Married <br>  Race: White <br>  Gender: Male <br>  <br>  Household Members: Name Age <br>  John Sanford 46  <br>  Martha Sanford 46  <br>  Josephine Sanford 16  <br>  William Sanford 13  <br>  Mary Sanford 11  <br>  Callie Sanford 9  <br>  Susie Sanford 7  <br>  Henry Sanford 4  <br>  Georgia Sanford 1  <br>  Murphey Jump 79<br>  <br>  This is a candidate<br>  Name: Jno Sanford <br>  Age: 10 <br>  Estimated Birth Year: abt 1840 <br>  Birth Place: Georgia <br>  Gender: Male <br>  Home in 1850(City,County,State): Division 11, Carroll, Georgia <br>  Household Members: Name Age <br>  Eleanor Sanford 38  <br>  Geo Sanford 45  <br>  Hiram Sanford 6  <br>  Jane Sanford 16  <br>  Jno Sanford 10  <br>  Mary Sanford 18  <br>  Thos Sanford 4|`|mcpu4ZDtaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  Well actually there are lots of genealogy sites in the internet but i would recommend the best site for me which is the Web Detective <a href="http://www.web-detective.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.web-detective.com/</a><br>  <br>  Web Detective is internet's #1 investigative resource since 1995 and used by many professionals including me.

wyOPQQ1jaa	Twilight is a series of four vampire-based fantasy/romance novels by the American author Stephenie Meyer. It follows the adventures of Isabella "Bella" Swan, a teenager who moves to Forks, Washington, and finds her life turned upside-down when she falls in love with a vampire named Edward Cullen.<br>  <br>  Twilight<br>  <br>  Bella Swan moves from Phoenix, Arizona, to Forks, Washington, to allow her mother, Renée, to travel with her new husband, Phil, a minor league baseball player. After moving to Forks, Bella finds herself involuntarily drawn to a mysterious, handsome boy, Edward Cullen, who turns out to be a vampire who drinks animal blood as opposed to human blood. They fall in love, and must fight off a vampire from another coven who is drawn to drink Bella's blood. Bella escapes to Phoenix, Arizona, where she is tricked into confronting James, a sadistic vampire who wishes to kill her. She is mortally wounded, but Edward rescues her, and they return to Forks.<br>  <br>  New Moon<br>  <br>  Edward and his family leave Forks because of his belief that he is constantly endangering Bella's life. Bella falls into a deep depression, until she develops a strong friendship with werewolf Jacob Black. Jacob and the other wolves in his tribe must protect her from Victoria, a vampire who intends to avenge the death of James, her mate, by killing Bella. A misunderstanding occurs, and Edward is led to believe that Bella is dead. Edward decides to commit suicide in Volterra, Italy, but he is stopped by Bella and Alice, Edward's sister. They meet with the Volturi, a powerful coven of vampires, and are released on the condition that Bella be turned into a vampire in the near future. Bella and Edward are reunited, and the Cullens return to Forks.<br>  <br>  Eclipse<br>  <br>  The vampire Victoria (James's mate from Twilight) has created an army of "newborn" vampires to battle the Cullen family and kill Bella. Meanwhile, Bella is forced to choose between her relationship with Edward and her friendship with Jacob. Edward's family of vampires and Jacob's pack of werewolves join forces to successfully destroy Victoria and her army of vampires. In the end, Bella chooses Edward's love over Jacob's and agrees to marry him.<br>  <br>  Breaking Dawn<br>  <br>  Bella and Edward get married, but their honeymoon is cut short by Bella's realization that she has become pregnant. Bella's pregnancy progresses extremely quickly and makes her very weak. She nearly dies while giving birth to her and Edward's half-vampire-half-human daughter, Renesmee, but Edward injects Bella with his venom to save her life by turning her into a vampire. A vampire from another coven sees Renesmee and mistakes her for an "immortal child", the existence of which violates vampire rules, and informs the Volturi. The Cullens gather vampire witnesses who can verify that the child is not one of the immortal children. The Cullens and their witnesses convince the Volturi that Renesmee is not a danger to vampires or their secret, and they are left in peace.|`|RBpNtzjHaa	Twilight- Edward falls in love w/ bella, james tries to kill bella.. edwards family destroys james..they go to prom .<br>  <br>  New Moon- Edward dumps bella, bella goes catatonic, Jacob befriends bella, bella almost gets eaten by Laurent, Bella finds out jakes a werewolf and the kids from lapush are mutating into wolves too<br>  Bella jumps off a cliff to go cliff diving.

THE END!
bZud91iuaa	First of all are you drop tuning the E or 6th (that's the big string) only or are you tuning to open D, 1st, 3rd and 6th?  If you have a tuner (electronic) tune both outside strings to D, by turning the "Thingy" or tuner, until it registers D.  Then tune the 3rd or G string down to F#. When you strum across all strings you will get an open D chord.<br>  <br>  Breaking strings happens all the time.  Make sure your guitar is acclimated to the room temp before you tune, while this seems minor it helps.  I can't tell you how many strings I've broken in 50 years.  Good quality strings last longer, but I still change mine frequently and at least 2 days before a gig to get the stretch I need.<br>  <br>  I play acoustic and acoustic electric and use Elyxir nano's.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped
dvns8jDaaa	Personally, I think it's to show the delicacy of Bella and Edward's relationship. A flower, much like their relationship is a beautiful thing. But, when it dies it withers away become ugly and wasted.|`|1nC4fVw3aa	It has no significant meaning..they just decided to do the flower and Stephanie Meyer agreed to it. but the other books do have a meaning. if you want then go on her site<br>  <a href="http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/</a>|`|AA10209040	Nothing.|`|iY36ARNwaa	I heard the New Moon art cover was the only one Stephenie did not think up. So you can pretty much imagine it doesn't mean anything. Yet there are many poetic ways to interpret it. I guess you really have to be the one to crack the mystery. I've had my theories.|`|SJvbro3Uaa	It doesnt represent anything, But all the other covers (Twilight, Eclipse And breaking dawn) do, though.
OjQxKGC0aa	Professional writers don't need someone else's story.    You seem to write well enough. You can change all the names and write the book under a pseudonym. Give it a scintillating title, and you might be able to find an agent. Buy a copy of Writer's Market 2009. It has a list of agents you can contact.
fFtBqFB6aa	The Stand, but it's quite long. Around 1300 pages. It's really good, though.|`|LVZdzPmpaa	Despite the fact that it was written nearly 30 years ago, most of King's fans still name "The Stand" as their favorite of his books. It is long as has been pointed out here, but it is a beautifully written, finely crafted tale that doesn't take that long to read. Once you start, it's nearly impossible to put it down. So, based on how long you have to read, "The Stand" is my first recommendation.    If you are allowed to read his only non-fiction, "On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft" is outstanding and one of the best books I've ever read on the subject. King tells the story of how he came to be a writer, which is laugh-out-loud-funny in a number of places. He is a generous writer, too, who lays it all out about the realities of the trade and the craft. He also talks about the accident that nearly killed him and how he's been transformed. Whether you write won't impede your enjoyment of this memoir.    Otherwise, I'd recommend "The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon," or "Misery."|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	Definitely The Stand.|`|2xa4414maa	The Talisman or The Stand.|`|qDSvOOwBaa	I have very little time for pleasure reading but I liked "Needful Things"    s_e_s|`|nFakIvgoaa	For school, I would go with Pet Semetary or Cujo.  They aren't as long as some of his other works and are very good books with a lot of underlying themes.|`|bITTzzcVaa	Pet Semetary will keep you interested and you wont be bored.|`|F32uPjAraa	"The Stand" is good, and so are some of the Bachman books, like "The Long Walk", "Running Man", and "Thinner". The Stand is a rather long book, I think "The Long Walk would be a good one for a school report. It is much shorter than "The Stand.|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	If you're reading it for school and don't have a lot of spare time do not pick "The Stand" which while entertaining is incredibly long.      If you want to be a writer someday read "On Writing" his memoir.  Great book.    If you like the creepier novels, I can't help you much I think his are boring, excessively long and a bit preachy.  Although I've read one of his books writing as Richard Bachman (his pseudonym) and it was pretty good.|`|dTNKdXHNaa	It all depends what you like. As you know, stephen king writes horror fiction. But it has many sub-genres.    Pet Semetary talks about dead pets and stuff coming out from the cemetary.  Cell is a zombie fiction book. quite an interesting one if you ask me.  The running man is a sci-fi suspense book. also another good one.  I haven't read the stand but i heard it's awesome  Christine is a 'car-come-alive' kind of story. interesting read too.    He also does short stories like:  The skeletion crew (or something like that)  Four seasons: This one is quite ok.|`|BxaajBbOaa	I've read them all and while it's tempting to mention one of his earlier classics, I absolutely loved "Cell". Great read that's reminiscent of "The Stand". Also loved the gunslinger series, tho they got a little slow at times.|`|79YQAbSRaa	Loved almost all of them.  But the ones that stand out for me were The Stand (of course), Salem's Lot (mostly because it scared the crap out of me when I was 13), Lisey's Story, and Duma Key and the seven books of The Dark Tower.  There's a difference between his pre-injury books and the more recent ones, and I've found I identify more with the post-injury books.  As for short stories, in Just After Sunset, I loved The Gingerbread Girl (for refusing to be a victim) and A Very Tight Place (because I love a story that elicits such a strong reader response).|`|fMJnB0zMaa	Pet sementary.
DK7kY36Zaa	imprinting is the wolf way of saying "love at first sight" but it's stronger. Like when I think its quill falls in love with the little 2 year old, he cant stay away from her. Keep reading the books they are awesome and in breaking dawn you find out who jacob imprints on!!!|`|X4eFDeWXaa	its when werwolf's fall in love with the other sex and cant bare to be away from them|`|RKbmRAR8aa	Imprinting is what werewolves do. Pretty much, they find the person they are meant to be with forever. It's not necessarily some sort of romantic love at first, and they don't force their affections on the person.they are just always there for the person they imprint on.  It doesn't matter if the person is a werewolf or not or how old they are.|`|e77d4af2a585abc3ccf7f5bbe20755f5aa	I believe it is like what baby chickens do when they hatch.  The first person/thing that they see is "imprinted" and that is who they see as their mother.     In the book, I think the author is using the same idea, except with love.  Whomever someone, like Jacob, sees that he imprints on is who he will love, regardless of who he sees later.      Hope this helps!|`|dcEXQsiZaa	Sometimes, when a werewolf sees a person. it's a lot like love-at-first-sight, just much stronger. It's like they have no choice but to love that person unconditionally until the day they die.    It's a werewolf thing. When this happen it means you imprinted on the person.
