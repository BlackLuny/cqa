20090202154845AAv7pVl	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do I do...?  I've done it twice to her in one week!!!?	Well my best friend and I only really see each other at church on Sundays and every other Monday for Confirmation...I love her to death and we have been best friends for almost a year...well anyways we had class on Monday and I thought she wasn't there so I walked right up to my other friend to go sit by her since we had already started.  Well I was walking and then when I get to a seat I hear, "Some best friend!!"  Coming from her cousin Amanda.  I look back and I realized I had walked right by my best friend and didn't even say, "hi"  I went up to her after and apologized and she told me that it hurt a little but she was fine...      But then on sunday, I was leaving church and I didn't realize that she was right there and walked right by her and then with a little bit of an understandable attitude she said, "Well if you are not going to say it I will bye!!"  And then I realized what I had done and I felt bad and thought how could you do it to her twice in one week?!?!?      What should I do she won't talk to me and I know she is really really mad at me...HELP!!!

We have been in a semi-long distance relationship for the past two years.  Yesterday he said, and I quote, "I don't know why I don't love you."  He said that he sees loving me as a lifestyle choice and he is not sure if he is ready to go down that road.  However, he did not say that he wants to break up.  I feel like my needs are not being met.  And yet, I love him and the thought of him not being in my life is terrifying.  Any advice?

I still haven't talked to my bf about still having feeling 4 my ex,   My brother and mom are getting into alot of fights,   I'm way behind in one of my college classes,   I have a major essay due next week which i have no idea what it is about  Some how i need to get alot of money to pay 4 all of the things i need to graduate, when me and my family are broke and my dad won't help    And i just got in2 a fight with my dad, which kills me so much because i'm losing him. i always used to be daddy's little girl back then now i can barely talk to him. the only reason i fight back now to him is because for years i stayed quite and almost let it kill me, but now that i speak up, no he doesn't try to understand. "He's right, I'm wrong. I don't know what i'm talking about, he's been there done that"  I'm losing my dad...   (my parents have been divorced since i was five)  He tells me that all the problems i have here at my home have nothing to do with him because supposibly we don't alow him into our lives and basicly my mother and her side of the families fault... When really the way me and my brother live has everything to do of the fact that we barely had a father figure in our lives in our most important years...idk    And i just found out that my best friends boyfriend might be cheating on her! They been together over a year, they live together with his parents, she's very young (18) he's older, and she's so in love with him.   I warned her this whole time that she need to change because they were tieing eachother down so very fast, and cus she would start alot of figths with him for little things.      I don't know what to do: when and if she finds out I swear HELL WILL BREAK OUT ON THIS EARTH!  And everything will be dumped all on me, all her problems, anger, everything. she's a very hard headed person  Plus she has nowhere to live if they breakup cus she's not going to her family.And i don't want her to move in with me because even though we're bestfriends we fight alot. i don't want to deal with her.i love her to death but i'm tired of her drama.i don't even want to tell her.    And of course this all happenes to be the day of my ex's birthday      :/ what i life...

I haven't dated in 4 years. It seems that everything has changed?! There are no single women that I can spot in any scene whatsoever. I live in Brussels, Belgium and everyone seems to be taken or are in groups of people and seem un-approachable.      I do get women to fly with me in a glider (sailplane), but those are club activities and they get there in groups too. Best/encouraging comment I heard outside of the cockpit is "he's kinda cute"... and then they leave.... in a GROUP....      I feel kind of alone. I'm a financial controller and have a nice appartment, but ZERO CHARISMA APPARENTLY.... Where can I by a large dose of Charisma?

20061207012744AAhHyEo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are black men arrogant? Please answers from black women only.?	Recently there are alot of messages being posted by black men, who are making comments that they are only interested in dating hispanic or white women, because they are just more attracted to them. Of course all of the spanish and white women had something rude to say, or made rude comments toward black women.      The feeling from everyone(non-black women) is that black women are angry about the fact that spanish women and white women are dating black men. Now my question to black women is that, do you feel that the reason black men are asking questions like this is to excite some type of uproar between black women and those that are non-black, as we have seen before. I have asked this question but only to understand the logic that black men and other people are using when they ask questions like this. Is the black man asking these type of questions to bring attention to himself in any way. And, black women how do you feel when ignorant spanish and white women make comments about us?

I AM IN SIXTH GRADE but i am NOT that stupid, whoever said that. I am more mature then some of you, and i can see that already. holding hands on the playground? god. no, not holding hands on the playground, and no not SEX!?? my parents know i am responsible enough to date, but NOTHING SERIOUS. seriously you guys, thats gross. you don't know me, i'm not that kind of person. I'm not stupid like some people who go out with anyone randomly, but its not that serious. just wanted to let you know. I am not stupid enough to get pregnant in 6th grade, otr go on a date alone. I don't date stupid guys and I AM NOT STUPID EITHER. You guys need to calm down iwould never do anything like that, and if you don't believe me, you obviously dont know me. I think it is beyond disgusting that anyone would get pregnant in 6th grade, like impossibly disgusting.

20070208164409AAiY0yg	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What would you do?	I am a bit annoyed.  A good friend of mine asked me for an "emergency favor" to watch her child but the emergency turned out to be her going out for a night on the town.  And it is not for a couple hours, it is for 7 hours (into the night).  I have a child, and two jobs (she doesn't have a job) and try to spend my spare time with my child doing things that he wants to do.  I agreed to the emergency, but I don't think that it was construed properly, and since I never go out because I don't have time to, I am a bit annoyed that she asked me.  It is not for a couple days but I would rather have my day off as my day off and not doing non-emergency favors for someone else.  It would not be a big deal if it were for a couple hours AND  if the "favors" weren't already piling up....what would you do?

20070211140129AAn3Rv5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	In a predicament/dilemma HelP! HELP HELP?	There is a girl I'm really interested in, but my concern is that we haven't known each other for a very long time. In fact, I talked to her only once in my English class on Friday. I find the girl very attractive because she has really pretty eyes, is eloquent, is smart, and is quite friendly. She seems quite interested in me too because she looks at me quite often. Valentine's Day is coming up soon, and I am worried if someone will make a move on that day. I feel that I should do something to get more attention from her, but the time just doesn't seem right. So I'm in a dilemma. A friend of mine tells me that this Wednesday is the day I should do something special, but I am not so sure if it's okay to give her a letter. Would she think I'm creepy as hell? What do y'all suggest I do? I really don't want to lose her to some other dude because it took me great balls to break the ice. She's the kind of girl I really want. Help!

It was going great....then he broke up with me. He says he doesn't like me like "that" anymore and he isn't in love with me anymore hes only in love with my body.but not even a week ago he still liked me and loved me in the way he did before. He keeps telling me to find somebody else, but I don't want to at the moment, I know it takes time to heal from this, but I've asked him if he misses me and he says yes. Then last night I was talking to him on my messenger and he said he is going through reprecussions. Then after he tells me like 20 min ago that he is in love with my body, then he tells me he isn't and he never said that...........he says he knows what he wants, but does he?  Then on monday he was over,  he held my hand to a song,(stupid i know) then he held a bear he gave me and asked if it made me sad, then he was laying on my floor and hes like "i should leave bc ur prolly thinkin hes right there and i cant have him" is he over me

I want us to be together, but like friends since we don't have alot of time to spend together; I just don't think we could do anything else. If you don't want to talk or see me again, don't talk to me then. I don't know what to say really. I really, REALLY like you Amber. - Daniel ?            2. (this was an answer to a question i asked him. i ripped a pic of us, gave it to him, then he gave it back) Amber, I kept that picture because I really like you, and I want you and me to be the best of friends, that's why: Because I love you.            3. (a cartoon bear holding a heart that says): I love you            I would like all opinions as to what exactly he means. Ive tried figuring out what he means but im clueless.

20070219142332AABCZiW	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why, besides the obvious reasons of sex/mating, do men check out other women ?	Why do men feel the need to always check out the girl walking by? I'm not saying that I don't do it either, but my husband will sometimes have to "say" just how great that woman's butt looks.. or her breasts. We are very happy in our marriage, but is it just a habit that alot of heterosexual men get into? I definately understand checking out somebody and keeping it to yourself, but is it something that absolutely has to be expressed at that moment? I also know that men have an instinct (as well as women) to do this sort of thing, but why do men step it up a notch sometimes? LOL

20090202202125AAe8mDy	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does alcoholism should be a crime?	I've being married for 16 years and my husband drinking got worse. He drinks every night to the point that he doesn't remember our conversation next day, lies about his drinking, hides the bottles that he is drinking, every conversation turns into a argument, bad influence for my son, I do not feel safe with him...etc. I tried everything to help him: assisted to AA meetings, read Alanon books, asked his family for help, went to the psychologist, prayed, asked people to pray for my relationship, talked to him, keep that house free of possible alcohol temptations, cried, beg him to stop, explained what his drinking is doing to our family, called the police asked to help me and do an drinking test...the police couldn’t help because drinking at home is not a crime,  unless he is disturbing the community.    I've learned that smoking pot is a crime and they can show up at home and do something... but drinking is not a crime. And that is my point of my request, in reality SPOUSE THAT DRINK TOO MUCH AT HOME ARE DISTROYING THEIR FAMILY is like killing in a passive way.    I know if you are in this situation, you feel like me.   I want to bring this matter to the authorities for their support. "Alcoholic parent living with their children should be a persecuted as drug abuse do"   If you agree with me please respond with a "Yes"

20090202204811AAOZ1Qw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you get your self esteem/confidence back when it has been eroded?	I've been down for a long time but lately it's been getting worse. I try to make myself feel good but somehow it doesn't really work. I've had problems in my marriage pretty much since the beginning. We aren't a good fit personality-wise. My husband is judgmental and critical - always sees the negative. I am an idealist. He really brings me down.      Lately I've been noticing how he does it. Whenever I have something to feel good about, he points out the bad. This goes for everything from getting excited about a career opportunity to feeling happy that my new face cream seems to be working. It isn't that he is outright nasty just that it is constant.      I don't want to hear Oh just leave! I want to hear from other women who know how to protect themselves from people who erode their self-esteem. My husband won't change, I know that. I love him and there are a lot of good things in our life together.      How do I bring myself up and keep him from bringing me down? How do I get strong by myself?

20090202202802AAh7smE	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Help he is deployed...Can my husband removed me from the joint checking account?	He got upset because he said he did not drink last night, but he did because it was all over the news and I saw the beers on his room over the webcam.    My husband told me he will removed my name from our checking account. He is deployed and he is acting very angry,I don't even know him no more. Last night after the super bowl he told me he will remove me from the SLGI life insurance and will leave me with all the debt. I have one direct deposit going into our join account too. Can he do that? take me out of the joint account?   Is he cheating? I have no clue!    .
20090202203909AASDt2j	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend distancing herself from me, what do I...?, Opinion...?	Ok my best friend since like we were little seems lately to be distancing herself from me. We are have been best friends forever, and I don't want to lose a friend. I told her it seemed like we haven't been around each other lately and she said she'd noticed and that she thought we were best friends, so we both make extra effort to hang out together, but then it just happens again, weend up with completely different groups which used to be together. Later she told me she thought that my friend and I were childish and laugh over the same stupid things over and over... which is exactly how she is, I actually am capable of having a serious conversation. But the really sad part is next year in high school she won't be going to the same one as me or practically anyone who goes to our school and I got pretty depressed and sad and she said she didn't care, maybe it just hasn't kicked in to her yet... but now I feel bad that I don't care because she doesn't and we both should! But I think we should spend as much time as possible before next year right? IDK!

20090202213748AApzke6	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How can I change my reaction to the criticism and insulting words the father of my children says to me?	My boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years and lived together for 2 years. We have an 18mo. old daughter and are expecting baby #2 in August. Things are not always perfect, but for the most part we get along, and love each other very much.       What worries me is his temper and the outrageous things he says to me when he's mad. A few days ago he told me I have "no fire under my ***" and I never get anything done."shut the f#ck up" "I'm f#cked for the rest of my life" "you have no drive" and what hurt me the most is when i asked him why he's with me if he feels that way, he said "I just want to see my daughter everyday so i have to be with you" This all stemmed from a disagreement over my aunts wedding cake that we were discussing in the car!      He has gone off like that a bunch of times and no matter how much i explain the pain it causes me, he wont apologize...I'll go on crying and feeling depressed and sometimes I even feel like I'm the one who needs to make it right, and sometimes i believe what he says after a while.  when I cry he'll call me a child and say what a bad example im being for my daughter.      I take care of our baby 24 hrs a day, and i do it with joy. I keep our home clean, and keep up with all the laundry. I really do the best I can and I love my life as a mom and homemaker. He hardly ever compliments how great of a job i do, and constantly throws it in my face that he pays the bills  and wishes he could "stay home all day" like i do, as if i'm not putting hours of time into our child and home everyday all day.      when the episodes he has are over (about 3-4 days) he'll be very loving and seem like hes so happy to be with me, its almost like it never happened.      Please give me some solid opinions on what you think may be going on and how it can get better, I'm afraid of this being a never ending cycle, and being pregnant, i cant take the stress and feelingbad about myself! help!

20090202202710AAwfbmR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I have a friend and she seems to have a few probs with the hubby?	a friend of mine has been with her husband for the better part of a decade and they have been married less than 4 years.  the problem is that everytime he drinks he tends to get really mean and calls her all sorts of name that just aren't right.  they have 2 kids that she stays home with and devoted her life to but he still has a habit of telling her that she is a terrible parent. he also lets her know that she is a terrible wife and person.  He forever tells her that he will take her kids to another county to live with his mother and that she will never see the kids again and that of she is that un happy with her marriage she should just leave and disappear and not look back.  i know she would never leave her kids.  the biggest part of the problem is that an hour later he wants to cuddle with her and pretend nothing has ever happened and i don't know what to tell her- he also finds a problem with all of her friends- she has been accused of having affairs with all of her guy friends and all of her female friends are either weird or whores.  she really doesn't go any where and does everything just to make him happy. but no matter what she does it's never enough for him.        she is looking for work but it's been hard when she has been home for the last 5 years taking care of the kids-  now she wants a divorce but has no idea what to do as far as having a place to live and taking care of the kids financially.    she's fed up and scared.  she is always hurting and has recently been diagnosed with depression.   i don't know what i can say to her.  can any one give me a few ideas?
20090202202834AAD8TDt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	We have clashing beliefs our relationship? Thoughts?	My boyfriend and I have been together almost a year and we're currently having horrible trouble in our relationship.    At first, we were fine. We had sex all of time and everything was perfect...but then he became a born again christian and says that he WILL NOT have sex again until marriage...but I feel differently about premarital sex. I think it's perfectly ok.     I'm constantly trying to think of ways to seduce him into having sex with me..and nothing ever works. He's so against having sex that he won't even kiss me for fear that he might slip up.     I love him so much..so naturally I would want to have sex with him.     So.my question is...should I rush to the altar just so I can fulfill my desire? I mean I've already considered marrying him in the future..just not right now. But I feel like I'm being forced to make a decision...Help please

I always catch myself hoping he's not doing something stupid, or hoping he doesn't have another migraine. [he gets them often]  So, I finally plucked up the courage to tell him that I liked him, but then something really inconvient happened. He got a girlfriend. I was so shocked and disheartened. I got so sad, so emotional, that I actually couldn't breathe. I know that makes me sound pathetic but that's just how it is.  I can't stand to be near him, now. He just radiates happiness, don't get me wrong, I am happy for him, but to see him with her...it just hurts too much. So what can I do? I've never loved someone so much, but now I don't even have a chance...

I think that girls are the most magnificent masterpeice ever. And I agree when they say that Guys were God's rough draft. They should be treated as princesses. When they are down they should be able to cry on their boyfriends shoulders, and 5 minutes later be laughing and talking to their boyfriends.      Girls should also let guys like me express their feelings and cry on their shoulders, becuase there is no better place to cry uther than a girls shoulder.

20070405141739AAe7tlM	Family & Relationships;Family	How should I resolve this?	Recently, my aunt (who is mentally handicapped) has began living with my family.  It works out wonderfully, except for one thing ... My aunt wears dentures, and she constantly sucks on them while she is watching TV or reading, making a "clicking" noise.  I don't really notice it that much, but my twelve year old daughter -- who has superhuman like hearing abilities! -- constantly hears it all the time.  It really bothers her.  She stays in her room from the time she gets home from school til she leaves the next morning, with the exception of coming downstairs long enough to eat.        I have talked to my aunt a few times, and her feelings were hurt and she promised to try and stop doing it ... but she hasn't.  I don't think she even realizes that she's doing it.  I've even suggested that she not wear her dentures while she isn't eating, and she responds like this is a punishment.  I don't know what else to do, and my daughter feels like she can't even be around her family anymore.

It happened suddenly, and when i attempted to contact my wife she was away at 9.30 p.m and not givig explaneation conviceingly on her late coming. So as could not contact her i took her along with her father and mother and a friend of mine to my home.

Instead of writing M_______ on the response card, could I just write out the names of the people it is sent to?  Maybe write out the names as they are on the outer envelope?        Also another question.  The ceremony is outdoors in the summer, but the reception indoors.  How should I let people know this so they can dress accordingly?  Should I just slip in a small piece of paper saying that "Weather permitting, ceremony will be held outdoors.  Please dress accordingly." ?  The invitations are already done, and there's no extra room to say this on there.      Thanks!

Hola, ultimamente no me he conectado... mi pareja me dejó hace 2 días... antes iba todo perfecto (era la 2a vez que lo intentabamos) Yo me fui al pueblo a ver a la familia... y cuando volví me dejó sin darme explicaciones... le llamé y no me cogió el teléfono... ayer tenía que venir a recoger sus cosas... y ni me avisó... recogió las cosas del piso y me echó las llaves en el buzón con una nota en la que decía: Mira Cari?o, he estado pensando y no somos compatibles, necesito a una mujer que me de dulzura y tus enfados pues como que no son lo mío... te digo esto porque no quiero que llores más y lo siento por darte falsas ilusiones... él era una persona que no expresaba sus sentimientos... no me prestaba la suficiente atención... se iba con sus amigos y yo no era bien recibida... si lloraba por algo a parte de que se mosqueaba, le parecían tonterías... es decir... que no me quería... no mostraba el suficiente interés... sé que tengo que levantar cabeza y olvidarle, porque será lo mejor..

Is he thinking of cheating?                      Recently I checked his myspace to see what a few mutual friends are up to (I have permission to do so) and noticed during these few weeks recently that he has been staying with a friend he seem to have decided to contact his ex GF and even went as far as giving her his cell. Now she is in the service in at the time she hadn't read them or message him back. Now I'm not usually the jealous type, but when a girl runs around saying she will steal your guy and keeps hitting on him after you hook up with him I tend to get a bit pissy.                 Back story if needed:   Married 6 yrs together 7, have 5 kids together, lived separately 4 times now. Every time has been during a pregnancy or after it. He has admitted to feeling trapped and wanting freedom while retaining the whole happy marriage and family. He has admitted to lying to me about work or school so he could hangout with his friends (I don't really know). Several times I had a gut feeling he might be cheating because he lied so much and because of who his friends kept company with. He once said his Best friends sister was drunk and put her hand down his shirt but that he pushed her off. I asked if that was all why would he wait months to tell me? One of his so-called friends said something that got around to me that the reason he was showering before he came over was cause he was cheating (he said it was because he was drinking and smoking behind my back). Till this day I can't believe him because he lied so many times.                   We are currently in agreement that maybe we aren't good as spouses but as friends like before we were married. We both love each other but we argue ALL the time and its very upsetting. He finally noticed his pattern not being supportive of us and bailing when things aren't going his way. However he still wants to retain the physical part of our marriage, I wouldn't mind but it would continue the endless cycle we are in. Now that I have said no, and we have argued REALLY bad this time I'm afraid he might be thinking of getting his needs met elsewhere. I can deal with the divorce, it seems like the best solution for all of us. However I will be really hurt if he can't even wait until the papers are submitted and finalized.       How can I know if he is going to? Should I get the divorce over with?   I want an unbiased opinion because I don't want to make a decision white we are arguing or because I am scared of him cheating.

20090202212334AAkiS5X	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I be upset that my girlfriend always wants to travel to see friends without me?	We have been together for 3 years.  I plan to take trips to see friends or just visit places together so that we can share the experiences, meet each others friends, take pictures, etc...  She wants to take trips solo to see her friends and hang with them leaving me behind and never planning for me to come along.  We were scheduled to get married last fall but put it on hold for financial reasons, which she now says maybe she is not ready for a relationship.
20090202212343AADh9ZF	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend who is emotionally unstable...?	I have a friend who is prone to "cutting people off" meaning deleting people's phone numbers and having the urge to basically wipe the slate clean (in terms of friends) and get "a new batch of friends."      She's 20 which is the time of finding/creating yourself and she's been feeling depressed/unmotivated for over a year now. Recently she stopped responding to everyone's texts and I think she's in one her of moods of just wanting to get rid of everybody and trying to re-invent herself. She's also been extremely jealous lately and controlling...she wants everyone to like her the best and she gets mad if she's not invited to every single event/get-together.      How would you handle this situation? Would you be offended that she's ignoring you? Would you be understanding? And how would you react when she's ready to come back in your life and be a friend?

20090202212628AAP1mgb	Family & Relationships;Family	Why doesn't my dad say I love you back on the phone?	Okay, so I married my high school sweetheart 6 years ago.  My parents did not approve of him, and I was disowned by my mom.  I haven't seen or spoken to her since.  I've stayed in contact with my dad ( once a month phone calls, yearly visits-I live out of state).  But, I've noticed that when I say I love you on the phone that he doesn't say it back.  Also, I'm always the one that calls him.  I gave up on my mom, she refuses to talk to me or open my letters.        Do you think my dad still loves me?
20090202212742AAgbVBN	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I right to be angry with him?	Okay, so, I'm in grade eight, and in grade four & five I had this really good friend Nikko who / really / liked me. He moved away at the end of grade five, and we didn't really talk again until last year when I found him on facebook, probably like, a year ago. We were still really close, like we had a lot in common, and we talked all the time. Then he came to see his grandparents in Calgary, where I live, and we hung out, and we had a lot of fun. After he'd left again, I was talking to his friend Cole on facebook, and he was like, "Soo, you're going out with Nikko?" and I was like, "No, wtf?" and he was like, "Seriously? He told me that you were his girlfriend, and I didn't believe that you existed until he showed me your facebook." Then I asked Nikko about it, and he denied it, and then after probably, a week, he admit it, and now he thinks that I shouldn't be pissed off at him, when he knows that I hate liars more than anything in the entire world.      Am I right to be angry with him, or should I forgive him? And why?

He told me he's changed and needs to figure things out, and I understand. I feel the same way too. We were both crying and holding each other, and we kissed when we said goodbye. He's graduating from college in a few months, and is moving to Africa for a year after that. He wants to get married and have a family, and I feel like I'm not ready for that. I am still in shock, but feel like something has been ripped out of my stomach. I want to throw up, I have been talking with my mom and a girlfriend is spending the night at my place to keep my company, but all I want is to be alone, and just read, and be by myself. Do you have any advice for healing? I just feel like I'm losing my best friend....it's so sad.

20090202225317AAZ8bYB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband and I were away on vacation and he got drunk?	Then he said all these sweet and beautiful things to me. He told me how beautiful and sexy I am, how much he loves me, how he could never stand to lose me, etc. He doesn't compliment me very much normally. I felt so good!      Then the next afternoon he said we should go to the bar and he could get drunk and say beautiful things again. It really hurt my feelings. I said "Why can't you tell me that you love me when you're sober? Why do you need to get drunk?"      I'm an attractive woman and I have a really nice body, so it isn't that I'm ugly and he has to get drunk to look at me. I get hit on enough to know I'm not a dog's breakfast! My husband is a very jealous man and he notices that I get noticed. One of the things he said to me when he was drunk was that he could never stand to see me with another guy. He said he'd have to kill him - or me - or both. I have always been loyal so there is no reason for him to think like that.       I just want to know if anybody can explain to me why a man would act like this - all sweet when he's drunk and then all critical and judgmental when he's sober. He's like Jekyll & Hyde. Which face is the real one?
20090202231010AA0tvMY	Family & Relationships;Family	Cousin seems hell bent on ruining her life?	My aunt has come visiting us and says my eighteen year old cousin has changed dramatically in the last few months.      She has always enjoyed drinking, but she seems half drunk or smashed out her face all the time. She was seen sneaking off with a married man after she finished work in her local bar and didn't come home for another two hours.       Her boss has told her parents she calls in sick for most of her shifts, the ones she comes to she's hungover and if she continues she will be sacked. She said she didn't care.      Apparently she didn't turn up for her last two driving lessons and when she did for the next one her instructor refused to take the lesson because she was so hungover she was over the limit.      She barely eats anything, but her parents have found empty crisp packets and wrappers in places in her room so they think her bulimia is back (she had problems with it in school) because she is looking thinner.      Any advice, my aunt and uncle don't know what on earth to do, anyone else had an experience like this?      Thanks.

20090202225710AAvtXUv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I start dating?	I'm currently married but separated from my husband of 6 years. We were Best Friends and HS Sweet Hearts so we've always been close even when we fought. Things are worse than they have ever been and I'm certain it's over. It seems for the best and maybe we can still be friends. I've decided long ago that if I ever divorce I will NOT remarry and will most likely be abstinent (I say likely because nothing is 100%). I know I won't remarry, however I am pretty sure I will lonely for companionship (not sex). I just want someone to hangout with and talk to. I have friends but they all live far away. I never dated before (had a couple boyfriends but did not do the whole dating thing).    My question is after everything is finalized and over am I wrong for wanting some companionship? Should I consider dating? I don't know much about it so I want someone with more knowledge on the matter to give me some advice.

20090202215859AAqITPr	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Spending a lot of Time with the SISTER?	Okay.... to put it simply, I'm an outdoorsy nut-bar. And as it happened last weekend. I found myself with my lady and her sister, hiking in the mountains. The Sister mentions she would like to do a long distance hike, possibly lasting for months. I am totally willing to do this, as the adventure is really exciting. But I know my g/f will not do anything more than a Hilton and Starbucks :- /      Would it be wholly inappropriate to hike this trail with her sister..possibly by ourselves? We get along really well, and probably have more in common with my g/f.

20090202224400AAViPc1	Family & Relationships;Friends	I can't stand my friend's grown autistic son!?	I'm a very patient person I believe, but my friend's son is driving me crazy.  He's so rude and violent and going to be 20 years old!  He is very verbally abusive to everyone around and frequently becomes physically violent.  Her son's behavior is starting to effect our friendship because I can never just hang out with her without her son being there too.  I think she should take action but she never does even though her son has caused her marital problems and she can no longer handle him (he's over 6 ft tall and a grown man.)  I am concerned additionally because she is fostering a child who isn't even 2 yet in this verbally and physically abusive situation.  I know she has options for her son, but she makes excuses as to why she won't take them.  She never holds him accountable for his actions because he's "autistic" which I think fuels the fire.    I want to throw my hands up and completely leave the situation but she seems so alone with her husband being deployed and having no friends who can handle being around her son for very long.  My husband is very close with hers and I really think she's great as a person but... there's the son.  I have not said my piece to the son when he becomes verbally abusive because I try to understand he's Autistic, but he is a grown man and as such I'm starting to grow tired of babying and protecting him from what is called reality.  I really would love to give him back what he's giving me and his mother, but I don't feel it's my place.      So, before I throw my hands up and exit the situation in frustration, do you have any advice on dealing with the situation?  Is this normal Austitic behavior?  Is there anything I can do to help the situation or should I continue to distance myself from her?  I do value my friendship with the woman.

Does anyone know if the CA courts count the montgomery GI Bill as income when setting a rate for child support? Long story short.. my SIL is going through the process of divorce and her husband is going to school full time and collecting the GI Bill ($1300+ a month) plus he works and makes about $1200/mo. He lives with his parents and doesn't have any bills (aside from car insurance & cell phone) but he doesn't give her a dime. She is far from a money hungry person.. but she needs some type of income to help support THEIR child.    When she files for child support, are they going to count his GI Bill as his monthly income, or just the $1200 he makes from his job?

20090202233728AApYvdK	Family & Relationships;Family	PLEASE HELP!!! How to resolve "daddy issues"?	My whole life I have had a very twisted relationship with my father. He's been there the whole time physically but mentally and emotionally he's invisible! I strongly believe he actually doesn't care for me. And my mother has even agreed with me and that it has been a huge struggle for her as well. I have a younger brother and sister and he has a stronger relationship with the two of them and around his house, has memorabilia of them where there is no trace of me. I had gone to counselling before to address this problem and the resolution was to forgive him for his past actions. I was able to do so but I recently moved back to my hometown and confronted with this problem again. Nothing has changed since I've moved away from home (6 years ago) and its no longer an issue I can leave in the past. I have never had full appreciation from a male and I don't know what it's like to have it. But I do want to put my past where it belongs and find that! But it's right infront of me all the time, how can it not affect me? Especially with him treating my brother and sister different than he does myself? The way I've been dealing lately is that I just pretty much accept the fact that I have no 'father' but just a biological dad because that is all he's shown to me for my whole life.

20090202235448AABtpVu	Family & Relationships;Friends	I don't want to be clingy but i think i am...?	I'm in my second year at high school and there is only 2 girls i really hang out with. We all hang out with a massive group of girls in our grade. I don't really know any of them that well, i have just made small talk with them.      One of the girls i hang out with doesn't mind me hanging with her but her best friend started to notice i was being clingy. She said to me 'you are so clingy your always there'.      I don't want to be clingy.. Its just that all my friends from my previous school (primary school) had left and i don't really have anyone close to hang out with. Its so awkward being the tag along... The girls that i hang out with are 'best friends' and i don't know where to fit in.       I know that i can just make some more friends.. But its hard for me to decide what to talk about. My biggest fear is not finding anyone to hang out with at lunch time..
20090203001446AAF4mSA	Family & Relationships;Friends	Was I too clingy with her?... ?	Well here in Australia, we've all gone back to school after having our summer holidays. Started Year 11, I've moved campus, so new people & stuff. Anyways, Ive been yesterday & today so far.      However, today I got to know a few people. We hung out on break and talked and yeah.      As we all went home, we talked more and eventually split paths. Me and this girl, Billie Jean, went off together & talked some more as everyone else went off... as she waited for her tram, we just talked, and as soon as it came and she had to go...      Guess what I did?... Offered a hug >.<      She agreed and we had a quick one, (i wasnt going for a long one) just a friendly good bye one, but was I too clingy?... Ive seen her for two days but actually got to know her for one. And we hugged?      I just hope I didnt come off too clingy, or gave her the idea that Im keen or whatever. Dont want her to be all "oh, too fast" on me or anything. Cos Im more of a get to know person. But Ive been so used to hugging girls in my time as a show of friendly affection or more that it became a habit.      She wasnt mad about, she happily agreed but yeah, I'm still weary of the after thought.      Was I too clingy, do you think?
20090202235543AAaVgM4	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Can I settle a party boy?	I went to my friends house and met his roomate who was really cute. The first time we just kissed and he took me to his room but I said that I should go and left. Then when I went over there again, we kissed again and this time he was trying to do more, feeling me up and stuff but I took his hands off. Anyway, my point is that I really like kissing him, but thats as far as I want to go, unless he wants a relationship but I dont think he does. He is a party boy but my friend tells me I am the prettiest he has ever been with and since I didnt sleep with him, like the other girls have, he will want me more. Also, my friends other roomate has a crush on me and so I flirt with him to get the other guy jealous. Is there any way I could get him to settle down with me? Or is this virtually impossible?

20090202235931AAmDdL3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im big, ugly, and scary looking.  but im really nice and gentle.  how do i get a girl to talk to me?	im 19 and ive never had a real conversation with a girl my age.  im not particularly interested in physical relationships or relationships at all, but it would be nice to know that there is some woman out there that would at least talk to me.  im about 6' 9" and im about as ugly as the back side of a mud fence.  im also kinda intimidating.  no matter how hard i try i still look scary.  i also live in a small town without any other people my age (especially girls) so the only chances i get to "see" any are when i go to town about twice a month.  Ive worked in the hay fields all my life and i don't make much money or else i would go to town more.  ive never been in a fight, im gentle, non violent, and full of love but i cant seem to find a girl desperate enough to take a chance on me.     P.S. i tried smiling about a year ago but everyone just though i was a creep.     P.P.S. im not looking for pity, im looking for help.  ANY HELP AT ALL

20090203010910AAVf8kV	Family & Relationships;Friends	I feel bad about being "close" with my guy friend?	He has a girlfriend that he's been with for like a year. But she lives in another city which is 2 hours away from our city. And they used to see each other every weekend but it gets less and less but they text 24/7 (not kidding, literally!). We're pretty close, like we meet everyday and hang out before school and become late for school cause we like talking 1-on-1, when we're at school, we stay in the classroom so that we can be alone together. And I talk to him about Boys,Clothes and everything girls talk about (except periods, excluding that ONE TIME) I don't have any friends that are girls cause they're always plastic to me.       And we even hug a lot, and I live in a Penthouse by myself (my dad gave it to me cause it's closer to school) and we hang out there and we just lie down on my couch and talk about stuff. And he tells me how pretty I am, and how my eyes sparkle all the time, how cute my voice is. And he texts me some "I miss you" and :* (a kiss face) texts but, I don't say "I miss you" back cause I feel bad even though it's true.. cause he has a girlfriend, and I ask him about the kiss face, and he says "Just on the cheek"       I don't know, he says he's like that with all his friends that are girls...and if he is, am I the only girl that feels weird about it? I'm 15 and he's 16. Both his best guy buds are players (like 3 girlfriends at a time kind) maybe there's something? I tried to tell him to back off a bit before, but he just got sad about it (I swear he's like a girl sometimes) and it made us both feel bad, and made me feel worse!

I think we both started to like each other. She found out I liked her, and said she didn't want a relationship then, but definitely wanted to get to know me better. Like an idiot I came on too strong and freaked her out. I think she thought I was trying to push her into a relationship. She started avoiding me, so I backed off. Even then though she would always talk to me online, so I don't think she wanted me to completely go away. She is starting to come around me in person more often now, but is still obviously a bit uneasy. I know I can't make her love me, or even be friends, but I'd like to at least try to fix things. How do I do it. Should I apologize for acting like a jerk, or should I just talk to her and actually get to know her this time, and not bring it up again? Kind of like start over and forget the past? Any other advice is appreciated. Thanks

Option A: Break up with guy B and end up "pretend" staying together untill the play(this weekend), so that everyoen doesn't bug us. Tell guy A(after play is over) that guy B and i were only "pretending" and have been all along.      Option B: Do the same thing with Guy B, but tell A that we actually were back together for about two days.      *i want to be back with guy A, but hes mad that i got backc with guy B after A and i kissed.   *option A does contain lying, but a more favorable outcome.

20070502215925AAHBjL4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	For the guys, how do I blow his mind?	I have been with my fiancee for a little over a year now...and right now, it seems like we are "stuck" in our relationship.      We've just kind of fell into a routine of work and school and not having as much time together as we would like. We also live with my parents until I graduate in a month.      Sometimes I just feel like we don't have time to focus on our relationship, on eachother...so, it just feels like he has "lost interest" because he works 4am-2pm tuesday-friday, so he's tired. Plus, he has to keep up with his classes online & he's stressed out.      So, I was just wondering what I could do to really blow his mind? Suggestions can be sexual, as well as not. I'm open to pretty much anything in the bedroom...so basically, what turns you on? Or is there anything that a girl has done that made you go "WOW"?      Also, what are some ways to emotionally reconnect with him?      If you need additional details, just send me a message.   THANKS MUCH!

20070510011438AAkh8L1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you understand why I might feel like this?	A year ago, two guys both younger than me and very much interested were playing one-up-manship over me. Both encouraged me to date them and did not ask for a committment, knowing I was probably looking for something more serious than they were about to offer, but they gradually came to offer everything. In the end I had decision to make, but I was unable to really think because my job collapsed, and I had a nervous breakdown. After I actually left the job and the dust cleared, I thought I still had a choice to make, and started breaking up with my friend and got ready to commit to my long-distance friend. But, just at that instant, he began dating someone else. I was crushed, I felt my trust was crushed. He felt, I think, that I should be tolerant of what he was doing, because he had been tolerant of me. To me, though, this felt like the ultimate loss of trust, because my whole reason for not committing before was his youth and my uncertainty whether he would be able to commit.

I kinda like him alot but lately we've been arguing. I haven't seen him in a week. He usually come down my house everyday, or I would go to his house. I can tell he likes me too because he always laying on me when we are in the car on our way to the store. I know he likes me because he always trying to make me jealous with other girls.

20070512234412AAuJo8J	Family & Relationships;Friends	I have been friends with this guy since high school.  Things got kind of tense for a while, and our friendship	became kind of an off and on type of thing.  We never, ever had any interest in eachother other than as friends, but we were as close as two people could possibly be without that aspect added in.  There came a point where too much damage had been done to our friendship, and we didn't really talk for a few years.  The last couple years we have been keeping in touch through email and phone though.  For some reason I can't shake the feeling that there is something going wrong in his life right now.  He isn't really writing back, and his facebook page has disappeared.  I've had the feeling that there was something wrong for a few months.  My question is, should I try calling to see if everything is ok, and if not see if there is anything I can do?  I'm not sure because I know I am no longer one of his "close" friends.  There are people he could go to, but we also had this epic friendship and amazing connection and I am really concerned for some unknown reason.  Any advice?  Thanks!!

20070516000553AANjSvc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Going bald..?	I recently noticed my hairline was receeding and I'm 24.  In general, girls have found my attractive but I'm not sure anymore.  Today a girl told me I should cut my hair short because it is long curly and starting to recede in one end if you look carefully. Although a bunch of my other girl friends told me it still looked good.  Not sure what I should do at this point....      Would you not date a guy if you thought he looked good and he had a nice personality but you noticed he was receeding a little bit.  Say someone like Jude Law?
20070516153438AAJ1Gc9	Family & Relationships;Friends	Choosing friends?	i am having trouble choosing between two best friends & each of them have their own clique.      1. M- She`s annoying at times & is ttly boy crazy which is not like me. She always gets in trouble and i'm like 1/2 her friend and 1/2 mom. She has her own group with all the boys. She says the boys don`t like me cause I treat them like ****. I don`t do anything and many people even told me M is the one like that.       2. K- She was one of my former best friends until i went to M. Right now me and her are really cool with eachother and she invites me to her group all the time. I love her but i don`t like her group. HEr group has a lot of girls and girls = drama cause all they ever want to do is diss eachother.       Which group should i go to?

20070610064628AAwub4K	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do with this girl?	Here's the basic story: I've become pretty good friends with this girl over the last school year, and I still am to this point. I recently asked her out, and to my disappointment, she said maybe. I was pretty much bummed out, and thought it was a nice way of saying no. I later found out through her friends and her that by maybe, she really meant maybe. She told me it was kinda random, and over the next few days she told me she really thought about it.      She broke it down to me like this: She liked me as a friend for now, and couldn't really handle a relationship at this time right now, and her summer's gonna be really busy. I told her, we can try to make it work, by just occasionally seeing each other. I also said I didn't want to immediately spark a relationship, but instead take it slow, to not put stress on our own agendas. But we really didn't finish the conversation, since she was in a rush.      I later asked about it again, just to be sure, and we ended up arguing over what to do.

20061103142053AAzpGDs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to tell if a man is interested in you still.....?	I have been seeing a man for 6 months.    For the first 4 months we talked daily and saw each other daily.     The last 2 months, I hear from him almost daily (not more than a day will go by without some type of communication).  Yet, now if I text message or leave him a voice mail - he doesn't always call back or when I talk to him he doesn't acknowledge the text or messages.           Would the assumption be he is not interested anymore and is just trying to quietly push me away?     We were so intense together and then bam -- something has slowed down.....  How can I figure him out???? (we are both in our middle 30s too.... Me - just finishing my divorce and he is in the middle of his divorce).

It always seems like I attract the women that never want to get into a relationship with me. I guess part of the reason why is because I never talk to females that don't send me any kind of signs.

20090202210833AAoVuMI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help? I need some advice, please!?	i've been liking this guy for MONTHS since September. I've tried to get over him, since he has a girlfriend, but I just can't. As a few months passed by, his girlfriend dumped him for another guy, and just recently he just got back with her.    He's in one of my classes and we were okay acquaintances when he used to sit near me. After we changed seats, he didn't really know me too much. Until last week, he started know that I exist. Because on Saturday, he asked my friends for my MSN and myspace, and added me. He talked to me a lot yesterday on MSN also. He even told my friends and me that he thinks my clothing style is cool. And also today, he went up to me during class and talked to me a bit, i even saw him staring a me a little, and i pretended to not notice.    I just have a weird, bad feeling that he's trying to play with me or something, I really like him and all but, doesn't he have a girlfriend? What should I do?

I had a new stylist today when I seen her we locked eyes like it was love at first sight. All I could think about was my christan loyal faith towards my wife. I presumed to let her cut my hair. She then told me a story about how her fiancee died in a motorcycle accident. The conversation started with me asking her how her day was. She said she was thinking about him. After the conversation I made her laugh. After she got done with my haircut she gave me her card with her number on it. She then looked at me in the eye and said call me.

20090109011226AAubJzC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Which of these would make a better dinner date?	1.  Dinner at North 44, considered one of the best restaurants in the country, has a renowned celebrity chef.  The chef has been bugging me to bring her to the restaurant.  He's promised to send us a limo to pick us, and drop us off, make us whatever we want, things not on the menu.  And give a tour of the kitchen at the end.      2.  Dinner at Mistura, an Italian resto, also has a celeb chef, but I don't know him.  Great food though.  Afterwards, I was thinking of going to Sopra Upper Lounge, it's a jazz lounge right on top of the resto, has the same owners.  Has live jazz music every weekend night.        3.  Dinner at George.  I planned this one a few weeks ago.  But she got called last minute for a photoshoot (she's a model), and we've had several meals together since.  But this place has great food.  A 7 course tasting menu that I think she'll like, very romantic, and service is brilliant.        I know these resto aren't cheap, but we take turns paying, and I don't mind paying for a nice meal for her.  So which of these 3 places would make a better dinner date?

20090202195356AA9mYUw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What  should  I            do?	A couple of weeks before the fall semester ended, I bumped into a beautiful women. We small talk and she asked me out to get coffee at Barnes and Noble. We talked and I really liked her. She has a beautiful body, nice face, from France and has a hot accent. At the end I asked her if she would like to go on a date. We went on dates and I fell in love with her. I could stare at her all day and not get bored. I have a great time with her. The only problem is she's 30 and Im 20. My parents kinda don't like the idea. We continued to date and it's been great. I started school and I walked in to my history class and she was there. She's a TA! It was weird but I told her lets be professional. She agreed. We took a test and received a 100%. I looked at my Friends test and he got a 100% but some of my answers were different. As I looked closer the B's looked different. I talked to her and she said she wanted to help me out. I got mad. I told her what she did was wrong and maybe I should break up with her. She got mad. On the next test I received a 70% and noticed that some of my answers were marked wrong. A couple of days later I ran into her and her HUSBAND. She broke my heart. Should I tell her husband? Should I make a move and date her?

I sent her a friend request and she confirmed it, but when I tried to click on it it said "You must be friends to view profile". She probably removed me. I don't think she recognized me. Should I just send a message saying who I am? I don't want to seem like I'm stalking her, but isn't the whole point of Facebook to connect with old friends?      I asked this earlier but received no answers.

Don't get me wrong, he's cute and all -- but he's a little too clingy, nice for me.       What do I mean by clingy? The day after he got my number he was texting me nonstop. I mean, I don't mind a guy trying to get to know me but it was getting really annoying. I'm a really independent girl and don't take mess from any guys.       He instant messaged me today as to why I haven't texted him in the longest time. I told him I've been busy.      Oh, not to mention his best friend called me a few weeks ago drunk making racially derogatory remarks. I didn't appreciate that either, this guy claims he had nothing to do with it.      Not to mention my close guy friend is making me feel bad, that I should be a little nicer to this guy and ask him out to coffee.      I don't have any sexual attraction to him at all, we'd be good friends but from his comments (flirty) toward me he wants something otherwise.      ADVICE???

I'm a "stand-by-your-man" type of girl, & I don't agree in having an attitude of vengeance or making someone's life miserable if they "hurt you", as for that I believe that what you sow, so you shall reap (if I may bring in some spirituality)...

I don't ask anything from anyone just try to get people to go to lunch or something we can do without it costing much money.

20090202204645AAjvN3j	Family & Relationships;Friends	...Looking for REAL advice. Keep your asinine comments to yourself.?	Ok....I'm having a lot of trouble with life lately. I'm a sophomore right now in a crappy little school and next year my parents have already decided to enroll me in college. I'm stressed out about that, but that's not the huge thing going on right now. Last year and most of this year, I was bullied by this one girl. She punched me in the face this year, which by the way, I couldn't get her in trouble for because it "wasn't a repeat offense." Well now, she's the only one acting like my friend. All my other friends have decided that I'm not cool enough for them or something. (This happened at my previous school too.) So now I'm constantly made fun of and the teachers join in on the mockery. I'm usually a good student, but lately my grades have been slipping again. I just don't see the point of anything. My mom just about died in the hospital this last week. I've already lost my dad. I'm just...I'm so stressed out. The only guy that likes me at my school is nasty. He never showers, it's just gross. So....it's just a lot of stuff and I don't handle stress well. I end up hurting myself usually. I don't cut myself or anything, but I usually end up bruising myself. So I guess what I'm asking for is how to deal with all of this. Or maybe I just needed to vent. Sorry to bother everyone. Um...bye I guess.

20090202202345AAUCt2n	Family & Relationships;Family	What to do when your spose is and Alcoholic?	I've being married for 16 years and my husband drinking got worse. He drinks every night to the point that he doesn't remember our conversation next day, lies about his drinking, hides the bottles that he is drinking, every conversation turns into a argument, bad influence for my son, I do not feel safe with him...etc. I tried everything to help him: assisted to AA meetings, read Alanon books, asked his family for help, went to the psychologist, prayed, asked people to pray for my relationship, talked to him, keep that house free of possible alcohol temptations, cried, beg him to stop, explained what his drinking is doing to our family, called the police asked to help me and do an drinking test...the police couldn’t help because drinking at home is not a crime,  unless he is disturbing the community.    I've learned that smoking pot is a crime and they can show up at home and do something... but drinking is not a crime. And that is my point of my request, in reality SPOUSE THAT DRINK TOO MUCH AT HOME ARE DISTROYING THEIR FAMILY is like killing in a passive way.    I know if you are in this situation, you feel like me.   I want to bring this matter to the authorities for their support. "Alcoholic parent living with their children should be a persecuted as drug abuse do"   If you agree with me please respond with a "Yes"
20090202202617AAK0cdH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend just made me as if I'm worthless and have no future, what do I do?	My girlfriend has been pretty down these past two days and she won't tell me the whole story.   I keep on asking her to tell me but she won't, i didn't go to school today because i have a cold. When she was on the phone with me after school she sounded happy with her friends, but when she's home, she is sad...      Just now i was telling her i was going to go to school tomorrow, regardless of me being sick. As i am writing this, it astounds me that i just forgot what exactly it is she told, and i made such a big deal out of it, but since I'm sick i guess i can't think right. She basically said, "why go to school, it's not like you're getting anywhere". She mainly said I'm dumb but not in those exact words but it really hit me and it hurt.      I've been with her for 3 months and i don't want to do her like her ex's have. I'm left with the thought of breaking up with her, but I think this may not be the right time to do so, i mean, did she just say that because she's upset? This girl means more to me than any other, Should i call her, or wait until school to talk to her, what do i say?

20090202211012AAu3wSp	Family & Relationships;Family	Too much drama in my life right now! help!?	So, theres been a lot of tension between co-workers at my job this past week and we're expecting a huge shipment to arrive there and it will be one of the company's biggest days. My mom is bed-ridden because she is threatening miscarriage, My dad is in Florida on business, I am doing school almost full-time, and lately I've been having serious stomach cramps whenever I eat, so I quit eating for almost 5 days, and now I am eating only raw. And to top that off, My sister went into labor!!  I've been going to work, then school, then I come home to tend my little brothers so my mom can stay in bed. I haven't had time for homework and it's stressing me out! I like to get straight A's and not doing my work isn't going to help me with that.  I just feel so overwhelmed right now! I googled 'depression from stress' and I think maybe that's what I might have. The good news is, my daddy came home yesterday, and my sister had her baby 2 hours ago and everything worked out great. Also, my mom lost the baby tho, It's really sad. It's her 2nd miscarriage in a row, and she wants that baby really bad! I cry when I see her cry. I can't watch my family go through these things! I'm so happy for my sister and her new baby, and all seems a little better, but I still cry all of the time. I am so emotional and I can't stop! And I'm usually not like that! My tummy hurts now and again and at first i thought it was just my stomach cramps, my back aches when I play the piano, and I feel like I'm getting another migraine, which I found were all symptoms of chronic stress. I suffer from trichotilomania, and I'm pulling my hair out faster than ever before! I'm soo scared! Is this normal? Whats happening...I don't feel alright........I'm afraid I'm gonna go mentally insane. I can't take all this!!

I just got out of a 3 year relationshi[p a month ago.We like make fun of each other a lot (kiddingly).

20090202205218AAyuMIF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am so jealous of my cousin!?	I know this is so weird, but I am 17 years old, and my cousin is 14. Now yes, that is a big age difference, but we grew up like sisters, (i even lived with her for a while) and we live in a small town so we have a lot of the same friends. Anyways, she is freaking drop dead gorgeous. She looks very mature for her age, tall, skinny, big boobs, cool style, popular, and has boys after her like crazy!   However, she does mess around with boys A LOT and has a bad rep for it. (she was 11 when she first messed with someone, lost virginity at 13)    But for some odd reason, i am so freaking jealous of her! I have been told i am pretty, but when I'm next to her, I am nothing. Guys always go to her before me. (she dates/messes with guys my age)   Ahhh! what can i do to help the jealousy?
20090202211418AARssJg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do, is it wrong for me to date a 16 year old if I am 14?	This happened a week ago what do I do?   So Im 14 and I really like this guy, who is 16, and he is my best friends brother. I spent the night at her house the other day and we were playing capture the flag with a few of our friends and him, it is when you hide an object and the opposite team has to find that thing, and it gets a little rough some times. So I was guarding him trying to make it so my friend could run to the "winning spot" and I took him down and I was on top of him, btw we were playing in pitch dark, and he flipped me over, with his hand touching my bare skin under my shirt, and we just stayed like that until my friend came in screamin about how we won, what does this mean, does this mean he likes me?, how do I take things "farther", but nothing to serious, just fooling around but not all the way, and how should I ask him out, or should I wait and see what he does, but hes not very experienced in the girl area, as far as I know

It's strange how somethings that we expect would keep going on stops, or something that was never there comes up. Incidents, thoughts / feelings(joy,grief,regret,passion,anger.... people etc...      Don't know if this would be considered a proper question in itself, but may be it's good to express and know that there's someone to hear without being judged. May be i'll test the waters before revealing mine...

20061122081359AANKOne	Family & Relationships;Family	Need advice about my teenage son...he is more and more disrespectful and angry and distant from me than ever..	I have tried therapy for around 4 years, that did not work, he has done very poorly in middle school but is still struggling, has alot of problems with behavior in school, disrespecting teachers, hangs out with the wrong crowd in school, at home he just goes into myspace, does homework only when he sees that i have reached a boiling point.  I have thought about sending him with his dad at least during the school week because he respects him and will be controlled...is this a mistake? Will he resent me, hate me?  I dont want him to think i gave up on him, but he needs to see that i am not a wimpy mom, and i will sacrifice not having him around as much for his own good.  I love him sooooo much but dont want him to drop out of school and be a loser in life...I want what is best for him, to have a future and be productive in our society...I welcome your advice...especially a teenagers point of view...it may help me understand what he is going through.

20061218170524AAooFN4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I I need an ANSWER!?	Me and my best friend are both recently single, therefore we are both looking for a new "Beau" to enter our lives. I am more so looking for Mr. Right since I am pregnant, I want to find a good Christian man that will help me raise my son, and love him as his own. While she on the other hand is looking for Mr. Right Now, she wants to meet a few wrong guys before Mr. Right comes along. I am extremely outgoing and always the life of the party. She is the complete opposite, shy, quiet, not willing to introduce herself to anyone, they have to come up to her and initiate conversation. The part that frustrates me though is we will go out and meet some guys, she won't pick just one of the cute ones and see if he's interested, she'll think they are all cute and basically claim them as her own, even though I am the one talking to them getting to know them. Needless to say, if I were interested in one of them I would feel bad going after them b/c I feel bad for her since she is less outgoing. WTD

20070702145544AA9nP6s	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What do you think about girls who have a lot of male friends?	I've always had more guy friends then girls, but sometimes people think there's something more going on between me and my friends, and I think that they think of me as slutt, which couldn't be further from the truth. When you see a girl with a lot of male friends, does it make you think anything different about them?

20070718093639AAh7H8c	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know what to do?	My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 10 months. He's a really sweet, caring guy and he means a lot to me. But lately I have not been feeling the way I used to about him. For the last couple of months we have only seen each other once a week, if we're lucky. When he calls (which isn't very often), sometimes I don't want to talk to him. When he says I love you, sometimes I don't want to say it back. He'll send me emails and I don't want to read them. Lately, whenever I think about him, I feel irritated. I am kind of scared because it went from hot to cold really quickly, and I don't like feeling like this. But the thing is, we have really been through a lot together and I really care about him, so even though I feel angry or annoyed with him a lot, I don't want to let him go. Have I fallen out of love? Or is this  something we can work on together?

20070823212336AAkiLGQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I want my friend (my old crush)?	I had a crush on this girl for a while. I barely talked to her but me and her brother were cool. It was a crush from a distance. Then I got over it. But now I find out that she used to have a crush on me, when i started hangin out with her brother around last summer.) now she doesnt have a crush on me anymore because she sees me as a brother. I guess when we talked on the phone, i was more of a friend to her. But now I want her back. Is this possible.        Also, I found out that now she maybe crushing on my friend. But, when i talked to her today, i told her i would call her tomorrow and she said "For the record, I really enjoy our phone conversations." Is it possible that i can get her to like me again? Also, how do I change her from seeing me as a brother to a potential boyfriend?

I don't know what to do :[   I'm a really quiet person and I can't help it, i'm also very very shy which sucks and feel as though i'm not worth alot.   I work in a supermarket and dread going there every week cos I get nervous that something bad will happen and people will talk about me as i'm quiet etc and i think the same when i go to college.   I dont know how to believe in myself, i've tried so hard.    I'm always caring what people think and wonder if any guy would like me.    Negative comments in the past from school have also affected me and I know I'm a nice, funny person if you get to know me really well.   I dunno waht to do :[... noone will listen to me, and I feel like crying.   If you wanna leave comments, feel free :]

20080621101200AAzcD9C	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do any girls actually like shorter, skinnier guys?	It seems like girls place a lot emphasis on wanting for their guy to be tall. You hardly ever see a taller girl with a shorter guy. I'm not THAT short but I am shorter than average...I'm about 5'7. On top of that, I'm thin. I only weigh about 135 lbs. So as you can see, I'm not the tall, muscular dream guy that most girls want.      I just ask because there were a few girls at work yesterday who kept talking about what they look for in a guy, and they all said that the guy had to be tall, because the taller he was, the more attractive he was. I dunno, it just made me feel bad about myself. Like if a girl saw me without knowing who I was, she wouldn't feel an attraction to me cause I'm short and thin.      What do you think?

The first guy (I'll call him Todd) is very confident and loves himself a lot which is a great thing. He is more out there, gossipy and talks a lot more.       The second guy (I'll call him Charlie) has a very low self esteem, and is more down to earth and modest which isn't so good because he lacks confidence.

20090202195830AA87npR	Family & Relationships;Family	I think my single mom might be bipolar or have anger problems, what do I do?	I am an only child, 15 going on 16 and my mom always has been mad for strange and usually unknown reasons. Whenever I get into trouble, she usually would do what a good mom does, but she overreacts a lot. For example, when I lied about bringing my iPod to school, she grounded me with nothing in the house and left, and still didn't give my things back even for school and still hasn't given them back. I don't know if I can take it anymore. I've tried telling her, she's probably forgotten about it... And now I need a direct aproach to MAKE her listen (without theatening her). If I don't hear from someone fast, I just might run away. Seriously, I have a backpack packed right now.

20090202200007AA7j8op	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Was I wrong to fight?	My boyfriend or ex i guess at this point is a pothead, he doesn't have a car, he has a job but he is paying off fines, he doesn't have a lisence, and he is 19. But he was really sweet to me to. He never really did anything wrong..but he started to change. He would NEVER call me. I would always go to his house to see him. He'd never make an effort to see me. Or anything. So I confronted him. He said that he was just stressed and a relationship was a little hard on him. I was like..okay...and we took a break. After a week of waiting..I was getting sick of what he was doing to me, so I went off and told him to grow up and that I was not going to baby sit him anymore. And I am never mad. I am always quiet, and he saw me unleash the beast. I still love him, and want him to talk to me and want him to see my point. I think any reasonable human being would of seen my point. Do you think he'll come around? Or was I way to mean? Cause I was yelling and probably the most angry I had ever been, yet I don't feel wrong cause everything was true what I said.

20090202205938AAQSNkV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it possible for someone to love somebody but be so depressed  that they think they hate the person?	Like the question asked: Is it possible for someone to love somebody but be so depressed and hate themselves from the bottom of their heart that they think they hate the person?      I ask because my best friend is in a relationship with a girl he is madly in love with. This girl fell in head over heals love with him at the beginning of the relationship but as her depression set in its slowly damaging the relationship.      she is depressed almost 24/7 and from the bottom of her heart thinks she is scum and wants to die (but due to religion won't kill herself..just wants to die in her sleep... Don't worry we're working on getting her help but its hard with her state and the economy)      Anyway, she feels like she can't ever fall in love with him again and sometimes can't stand him, but also needs him and can't stand the thought of going even a couple days without talking to him? Is it likely that need a sub-conscious love distorted by all this hate and pain?      Please answer only if you have experience in similar or in the psychology of depressed people.
20090202210057AACPpbQ	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I help my parents get along better?	my parents have their normal arguments just like every couple does; but when they do have arguments, my dad will just flat out stop talking to my mom for about a day or so (and my mom will start crying because she just wants everything to be normal and she wants him to talk to her about what's bothering him instead of keeping it to himself. )  and will sometimes even leave the house and go down to our shore house. Also if they fight and my dad doesn't leave the house, they won't sleep in the same bed with my mom. He'll go and sleep on the couch because he wants to be left alone. If it's a really bad fight and he's really mad, he will drive off, and start saying really hurtful things out of anger. (Like one time my dad had sent my mom a text message out of anger saying 'get a lawyer'; and that had pushed my mom over the edge. She was crying harder than I've ever heard her cry in my life. And so I had sent my dad a text message telling him to please stop fighting. After he cooled down while driving 45 mintues to our shore house, he came back home and had apologized to my mom for everything that he had said and he said that he didn' mean any of it.    The thing with my dad is, he doesn't get angry very often; he's usually a very calm guy. But when he does get angry, he goes through two stages. (as I have carefully observed from watching him get angry many times.) The first stage is the exlosive rage. He will spit venom in his victim's face until his victim is reduced to tears. Then the second stage is the cold shoulder stage. After he's done spitting his venom at whoever he's angry at, and the other person wants to say their piece, he will completely tune them out like they don't even exist. (And he doesn't just do this to my mom, he's also doing it to my sister currently, and I've gotten it a few times myself.) And I'd like to mention that the venom-spitting stage is twice as bad when he has a little too much beer in his system. He will say much harsher things and is very difficult to reason with.   The reason why I am asking this question and explaining this situation to everyone is because I am concerned and I am worried. I am concerned for my parents' marriage, I am concerned about my dad's emotional health, and I am also very worried about my parents' marriage. I really wish they would find a better way to handle things when they do have issues, but I don't know how to help them. I've tried talking to my dad plenty of times but there's no getting through to him. (maybe I'm not saying the right thing? I don't know.) I love them both very much, and it just pains me to see them fight like this. Can anyone at all help me with this issue? I'd appreciate any advice I can get! Thanks:)

20090202210537AAMyA34	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I am upset at my dad, because he did not allow me to get a pair of women's shorts at the department store.?	Ok the story was like this. I'm a 19 year old guy. I'm 100% straight in my sexual orientation ever since i reached sexual maturity, neither homosexual nor bisexual. I live in a capital city in one of the nations in South East Asia.      Yesterday, Sunday, at about 5pm, I, my dad, mum n sis went on a family outing to the department store. Coz my dad had this complimentary shopping vouchers at that store, given to him by American Express Credit Card company. So we went there for some shopping before we had dinner.      My dad allowed me to get an piece of clothing, i decided to buy a pair of shorts.... casual walkshorts. I went to Billabong section, n decided to try on this pair of men's walkshorts. I asked the retail staff if they had waist size 28 shorts, since i wear about a size 28 waist.       She told me size 30 is the smallest they have for these walkshorts, since size 30 is the smallest size they stock here.       So i tried on size 30 anyway, it was a bit loose. I went back to her n asked her if there is any other type of similar walkshorts, but in a smaller size. She showed me the young men's collection, but i didn't like their color/design.       I asked her if the women's range had something similar. So she showed me this pair of shorts...it looks really great. The material is a bit glossy since the fabric had some shimmery threads woven in it.       This is the pair -  http://i42.tinypic.com/2nlqlfn.jpg    back view -  http://i44.tinypic.com/34efblj.jpg       I tried on a size 8, n it fit me perfectly, on my slim waist. It was a bit of a tight fit on my rear, n crotch area, n slightly on my thighs. The shorts ended slightly above my knee, therefore it didn't look too revealing, such that others could immediately tell that i was wearing feminine clothing.      I looked into the mirror n admired it, n said to myself...hey i really like the look of it, especially the the slim cutting. As for the low rise of the shorts, i can deal with it, coz i normally wear low rise hipster women's jeans, which normally has a front rise of 7 inches. N I don;t find them uncomfortable at all. (By the way, i prefer to wear female jeans since it has a slimmer cutting n sexier than the men's baggy jeans.)      I decided to get that pair, n i asked the retail staff, a young lady, if it was ok for a guy to wear female shorts. Apart from the slighty glossy material n tight fit, it didn't look too feminine at all. She said "it's ok i guess, if u like it"      So i decided on that pair, n i met up with my parents n sis, since my dad is holding on to the vouchers, n those vouchers require his signature n presentation of his credit card in order for it to be usable at the cashier.       They had some stuffs with them which were unpaid...so my is dad gonna pay for all the items all at one shot with the stack of shopping vouchers. My mum looked at the shorts which i chose n asked if it was a mens or womens shorts?      Coz she somehow suspected i would select a feminine bottom since i often wear tight low waist female jeans. I lied to my parents n said it was a men's shorts, but my dad didn't buy my story, n he decided to approach the Billabong retail staff to clarify.      I n him went there, n when i saw the lady, i quickly told her "These shorts r unisex, right?" (hoping she would tell a white lie for me)      Then my dad demanded to know if these shorts r for male or female, n she kinda looked scared since he had a menacing look. She then said yes, it is actually for females, but nowadays guys also do wear such slim fit shorts as its the new trend.      My dad was pissed n he said 'no, i object to u getting this pair...please choose a men's shorts!'      I argued back n told him that the men's shorts smallest size was 30, they're kinda loose for me, n so i had no choice but to get the womens shorts. He still said no, n when i tried to reason out with him, n he got angrier n said 'then in that case i do not allow u to buy anything!!'      so i said ok ok fine...i went to get another piece of clothing, a polo shirt, n then my dad went to pay. Then I said I really like that shorts, I am gonna buy it with my own money, but he said 'No, I do not allow u!' firmly n in a harsh tone.      Later, we went to a restaurant next to the departmental store, n my dad interrogated me n asked me why am i always wanting to buy n wear female clothings, n asked if i was a transvetite, n asked if i wanted to become a female.... I said no i am not! i just prefer female jeans n bottoms since i like the slim fit look, n i told him its the trend nowadays.... just like guys wearing skinny jeans.      He didn't seem to understand n told me why don't i just be f*cking normal n be more manly...n stop being a sissy fag. He said if i go on like this, i will end up on the 'dark side', before i even realise. N he said I will bring shame to him...      Later on, i told him i really like the shorts n i wanna buy it, with my own money. He got pissed n said "No!! if i ever see the shorts, i will rip it to

20090202211013AA4IlVR	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is Pleasuring Your Man Your DUTY?	I'm just curious to know, how many women pleasure their men and expect, (and possibly get), nothing in return. If they don't return something to you, are you alright with it? Or do you do it without expecting something but know he's going to do something more for you. If you were in a relationship with a man who only wanted to get the pleasure and didn't care to give it back "More thank 60% of women don't orgasm" (THAT doesn't mean I should be one of them)      I you do something pleasurable for your man, will he give you something back eventually, or do you do it because you feel it is your "duty" and he will leave you if you don't? any suggestions on someone who is being told they shouldn't expect a "fair" relationship.... to be told a "one sided" relationship is one of the only relationships that will possibly work.... Any help... please
20090202211419AAxM7XE	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I make friends when I have such a bad reputation?	I want more friends, those true friends that will always have your back about anything. I am 17 almost 18 and I have had so many friends I cant even count, but we havent lasted that long. They either wanted to have sex all the time which isnt me, or wanted to fight and cuss people out and I admit that was me but I have changed. Now people still see me as the girl who was rude to everyone but I have changed. Im also very shy and I can never say anything to someone unless they say hi to me first. How can I break out of that shell? And how can I attract honest trustworthy people towards me?

They told me that it would take a week or two for me to go through the process. I took the application   for AlliedBarton (Mall Security). The supervisor told me that I should come in tomorrow between 11am to 3pm.   I'm in school at 3pm and get out at 3:45pm which means i'm going to miss the director tomorrow. I asked my mom   to write me a letter to release me from school an hour early to let me meet the director and she said no. I called   the security at the mall and asked when the director would be in and they said they didn't know because she would   be going to workshops for a while. Now my mom has said no and I am without a job. What should I do or what can I   do to make her change her mind? What should I do?

20090202212800AAjyeiU	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is he ignoring me? What should I do?	So I've been seeing this guy (not officially dating, but it basically felt like it) for about a month now and we were really close, we've kissed a zillion times, I spent the night at his house a ton of times, (but didnt have sex, which is nice that he didnt pressure me) and went on dates and stuff a ton of times. The last time I saw him was last week, after we went out to dinner, went bowling and rented a movie. Then I spent the night and we just cuddled in his bed like always, nothing different. He even paid for everything. When I left he kissed me goodbye and said he would text me later to see if we could hang out that night.      He never texted me. I brushed it off and texted him the next night just saying that I thought I was getting sick again (cause we both had gotten sick) No response. That was wednesday. Then last night I just texted him and said "heyy :)" and no response. Wtf? why is he ignoring me? He seemed really into me and said he missed me all the time and it honestly seemed genuine. I've been played before and this didnt seem the same, and this really hurts.      What should I do? text him or just not contact him until he returns the favor? I dont want to seem desperate and text him again but I dont want this to fall apart either. this really sucks :( why could he be doing this? :(

20090202213047AAeuOoE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does my ex REALLY wanna see me or just messing!!..??	I was on msn last Monday and my ex-bf said hi to me. It was Chinese new year so he said happy new year! Then he said "Hope you stay beautiful forever" Was this a compliment? Or a diss? What does it really mean? He also said he wants to have dinner with me...He said he wants to see me and we both agreed that next week is a better time for us both. Then he asked for my number on Monday and said he would call me in later on this week. I gave my cell # & told him that it doesn’t have caller ID, so if I miss it to try again another time or to text me. Wednesday night someone called me but I was in the shower & missed it. Since I don’t have caller ID I dunno who it could be, but I have a feeling it was him. Today (Monday), one week later, I got a text from someone saying"hey wats ur schedule like". I asked who it was was, he replied, it was my ex indeed. I said "oh haha we can talk later...".  Then he texted again & ssaid if I wanna meet up.    I went on msn now to talk to him instead of texting back. I kinda don’t wanna see him cuz I know how he is, we met up once before, it went bad. Neways on msn, I asked him first when was good, he said this week was bad, but the following Friday is good. I said I’ll be busy. Then he said “haha, why is it so hard to see you?”  I said “why do u wanna see me? He said “cuz I miss u?” Then I told him thr truth how I kinda don’t wanna see him. That I do but I don’t. I asked if he really wants to see me, he said “I do, why else would I ask”.  Then I said maybe to the Friday date but for him to ask me again. He said he will. At the end, I said “One more thing, you’ll have to try harder if u wanna see me hehe :P”. Based on the conversation would he say he likes me, has feelings and really wants to see me? Was it bad of me to be honest with him?   BTW we never had sex while dating cuz he knew I wanna save it for marriage, so don't he wants sex.

20090202212443AArUj4a	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this okay to say to them tomorrow? Do I have the right to be made? [10 points]?	Well, today, my "friend" ignored me at lunch. She didn't look at me. She isn't what you would consider a friend, but I'm desperate for a friend.   During lunch, I never talk, I try to be as nice as I can, etc.   No, I TRY to be as good of a person as I can to EVERYONE. And yet, I'm treated like crap. And I'm about to burst one day and show my true side.. [I'm a loud *****, deep down]      Okay, without going into details, my so called "friend" talked to me in the beginiing of the day.   I've been absent for a couple of days, so I didn't know where to sit, and I saw her. I've sat with her for the whole week, ever since the new semester started.      Well, she didn't even look at me when I walked into the lunch room. Then I was just walking past. i was thinking about sitting down.. I wasn't sure with the weird looks I got, and her bitchy friend Stacey said in a VERY SNOBBY BITCHY WAY: "Uhm, the seats are kinda full."   Then I said "I know.." because I didn't want to sound.. well, I was embarassed for being rejected for NO REASON.   Then, they turned their heads and laughed.   I was about to beat the **** out of them, but I decided not to.. I was trying to hard not to cry and look like a pussy. [Which I am..]      What bothers me, is her b!tchy friend doesn't even KNOW me, and can just say that and turn away, laughing?!   I'm NOT going to put up with that. So.      This is what I'm going to say to them tomorrow:   First, my fake friend's friend: "Hey, I jst wanted to ask WHO do you think you are to be allowed to laugh at me? You don't even know me! Its MY RIGHT to be able to come to school, and not have to worry about bitches like you. You have absolutly no right to make fun of someone without knowing them, just by what some ***** told you. Its not YOUR place to do that.  You could have told me in a nicer tone not to sit there. You didn't have to be bitchy about it"      And if that fails, I slap them both. [No, I won't.]      Just wondering, will this put them in their place?   I'm shy, until my feelings get played with. When I get mad, I get FURIOUS.       -_-   I can't wait for that. Put that ***** where she belongs.   They probably won't even expect it from me. :]

She has tried to break up with him so many times but every time he threatens to kill her, I said I would go over there and give him a beating he would never forget but she doesn't want me to get involved.

Today, my boyfriend and I were making out, then we stopped for a while to talk. About five minutes later, I leaned over to kiss him and he totally PUSHED me away and said, almost angrily, that he didn't want to be kissed be me at that time.  I felt totally rejected, as though he was telling me that I wasn't good enough for him.   A little while later, he tried to kiss me, but, I wouldn't let him. I felt too sad and hurt to want to get physical with him at all. He understood and apologized, but it really upset me.  Was I overreacting?

20090202212042AAEvbjk	Family & Relationships;Friends	For some reason these girls dont like me?	im an asian girl in high school but im not apart of the asian group and have my own group i sit with. im in classes with some of them and for years now, if i nicely ask them a question or say something they would glare at me, give me abrupt answer or just ignore me completely. im simply trying to be a good person and i dont want enemies but these girls seem to hate me and i dont know why. they're not the kind where u just ask whats wrong and they tell u and everything is fine. they are also friends with one of my friends who is actually indian but everytime i start talking to my friend, they ditch her and start walking away like they dont want to be around me. i will be honest here, i have not done anything to piss them off or make them hate me. is it simply because im an asian in a non asian group?   nearly all of the asians at school are in that group   and what can i do?   its uncomfortable sitting in class knowing there are people who hate me there too. i cant learn properly
20090202212133AAhzVO6	Family & Relationships;Friends	My sisters friends dressed me up as a girl at her sleepover and took bad pics of me, what can I do?	Im 15 and my sis is 13. She had a sleepover with 7 other girls at my house. For most of the time I was upstairs and they were in the basement. Then later one of them came up and kept talking to me and asking me to come down, she was really insistent on it. I knew my sis wouldnt like it but after a while it annoyed the crap out of me so I finally did. When I went down my sister was already asleep and the other girls were all awake.       They all waited for me to get down there and as soon as I did they looked at eachother then all of the sudden grabbed and tackled me. They put me on the ground and held me down, I could do nothing and was shocked. I was trying to get out, and kept trying and still they wouldnt let me. They put a bunch of makeup on my face, it was horrible, and lipstick on me. My face looked like a girl. they kept calling me girls names and taking pictures with me, it was humiliating!      Then it got even worse. They got a bunch of dresses and girls clothes and put them on me. They kept putting on different things and taking pics with me and them like I was one of the girls. Then finally after all of this they put me back in my clothes and tied my hands behind my back. Each one of them took turns going in the closet with me and they kept kissing me, and the worst thing is they took pictures of it, each one. There was probly 500 pictures.       After that I started to think about the pictures, I could get in trouble if it didnt look like they were making me do it. So I started begging for them to delete the pictures. They said they would delete them on one condition, if I would just put on a girls swimsuit and go in the hot tub with all of them. So I thought this was my only chance to get those pics deleted, do I did put on one of their suits and I went in with them. They were all over me, feeling me and calling me honey and it was sooooooo awkward. They kept calling me girls names and kissing me and taking MORE pictures. I eventually got so fed up and tried to get out if they werent gonna delete them, but they wouldnt let me out. They kept taking more and more pictures. It looks so bad, me in a girls swimsuit with a bunch of younger girls kissing them and with makeup on my face. If those get out, I am so dead. I need a way to get these pics back or deleted somehow!      Oh yeah, and eventually they finally let me go and I went upstairs and went to sleep. (back in my clothes) but I woke up in girls underwear! They switched while I was sleeping, they are crazy!!! My friend (a girl and big sis of one of these malicious girls) came in my room to wake me up and saw me in the underwear, she laughed so hard. I tried to explain but there was no use. Now she keeps calling me girls names too. I NEED HELP. I need these pics back and deleted and a way to clear my rep!
20090202212211AAVkVZG	Family & Relationships;Friends	Dating Best Friend. . .How?	My best guy friend loves me (like more than a friend). We've been together for 6 years but not dating, just friends. I have been liking him more than a friend for about 6 months.    He got a girlfriend.    My best girl friend told me that he said everytime I'm with her, all he will think about is me. He didn't want to ruin our relationship because he didn't know how I felt.    I hang out with him more than he does with his gf. She is a 9th grader and we are both juniors.   It breaks my heart when I hear people ask if the girl is his gf. One night I bawled because we are so ment to be. What should I tell him? His relationship with her is nothing because he can only see her at school. I want to say something, but I don't know what.   Please give me your advise.   I appreciate it very much.         Also, should I wait to say something after they break up or now? Will he still feel the same way towards me in a few months?         And, will he admit he likes me if I say somthing to him?   How should I do it?
20090202212320AAcWIyu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He told me he's "talking" to someone new, am I wrong in my decision (a more mature question)?	Long story short: We were engaged, broke up a few months ago (he had been controlling, abusive and cheated, but still had a great side that I love), still slept together and said our I love you's up until a week or so ago. I told him I was done last week, everything.  I couldn't go on being used because I loved him. It's been so hard, but I have to go on with my life. So today he called and told me he is talking to someone else (not a "relationship" but you know).  Would it be wrong for me to pick myself up, talk to, and have fun with a guy who started flirting with me a couple days ago..no relationship..just something to help me move on (not using him or anything).  Should I tell my ex, who told me only a couple weeks ago that if he found out I was talking to anyone, even a year from now, he'd find them and hurt them?  I feel like I owe him the courtesy, even though I feel he only told me to get a reaction since I haven't talked to him since the day I said I was done.  My friends say no because it's over and he's done me wrong etc.  I don't want to seem promiscuous either, I've only been with 3 guys, this would be a first for me. It's all so confusing to me..I went from believing this was the guy I was going to grow old with and we would never separate..to this.  But I do know that if he wanted me, he'd have me and wouldn't be hurting me the way he has, I've finally accepted all my hopes of going back to the way things were were just that..hope, not reality.   Thank you for any help.
20090202212327AAE8toA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE ANSWER!!! Why did my EX say THIS to me!!!?	I was on msn last Monday and my ex-bf said hi to me. It was Chinese new year so he said happy new year! Then he said "Hope you stay beautiful forever" Was this a compliment? Or a diss? What does it really mean? He also said he wants to have dinner with me...He said he wants to see me and we both agreed that next week is a better time for us both. Then he asked for my number on Monday and said he would call me in later on this week. I gave my cell # & told him that it doesn’t have caller ID, so if I miss it to try again another time or to text me. Wednesday night someone called me but I was in the shower & missed it. Since I don’t have caller ID I dunno who it could be, but I have a feeling it was him. Today (Monday), one week later, I got a text from someone saying"hey wats ur schedule like". I asked who it was was, he replied, it was my ex indeed. I said "oh haha we can talk later...".  Then he texted again & ssaid if I wanna meet up.    I went on msn now to talk to him instead of texting back. I kinda don’t wanna see him cuz I know how he is, we met up once before, it went bad. Neways on msn, I asked him first when was good, he said this week was bad, but the following Friday is good. I said I’ll be busy. Then he said “haha, why is it so hard to see you?”  I said “why do u wanna see me? He said “cuz I miss u?” Then I told him thr truth how I kinda don’t wanna see him. That I do but I don’t. I asked if he really wants to see me, he said “I do, why else would I ask”.  Then I said maybe to the Friday date but for him to ask me again. He said he will. At the end, I said “One more thing, you’ll have to try harder if u wanna see me hehe :P”. Based on the conversation would he say he likes me, has feelings and really wants to see me? Was it bad of me to be honest with him?   BTW we never had sex while dating cuz he knew I wanna save it for marriage, so don't he wants sex.

20090202213329AA3iEqL	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Was I justified in yelling at my girlfriend?  Please help!?	Before everybody starts flaming me for yelling at my girlfriend, let me just say that I'm a very calm person normally, and it does take a lot to get on my bad side.      The story is, she needed help with her Senior Letter of Intent paper.  Me, being very handy with words if I do say so myself, was going to help her because, well, she's not so great with the English language.  She was born and raised here, as was I, and as we all know most Americans aren't too formal with the way they talk, it's more of slurs and she includes that in a professional letter.  Anyways!      Back on track, the beginning of her paper, the Header and everything, looked fine.  I told her so, she seemed pleased.  When I got down into the first paragraph though, I noticed she used the word "organization" about 9 times just throughout the first few sentences.  I told her, "Babe, to me it looks alright but you're using that word too much.  Can you find another one?"        She responded with, "Why?"      I said, "Because when you use the same word repetitively, it looks like you have a much smaller vocabulary than you actually do."      From there, she basically turned into psycho-mode as my family refers to it, not to her face though.  Even if they don't like her, they'll still treat her like family because that's how we are.  Although there have been several occasions where she doesn't deserve it.  I'll leave it at that.      I also noted about her punctuation after every period.  To my knowledge, there is ALWAYS supposed to be 2 spaces, and seeing as this is going to be a Senior Project and a major letter to the board of judges, I pointed out that she may want to fix this.  She always put 1 period after every sentence.  She flipped out from there.  Like, completely went off on me about how it doesn't matter whatever I ****ing think her English teacher told her it's fine like that.  Which to me, is a lie right to my face, because no teacher who has ever taught grammar or computer apps, as hers has, would ever say to put just 1 space after a period.  I let that go, though.      I was really beginning to get pissed, and I told her and asked her in as nice of a voice as I could muster up to please try to calm me down or be nice or I'm going flip.  Obviously she didn't get the memo, or didn't care enough to stop.  Because the next thing was her trying to explain how that she should be mad at me and I'm ****ing stupid if I think I should be mad because all I'm doing is criticizing her and not helping.  And how I should just change the stuff instead of just criticizing her.  But wouldn't that mean that I'm basically doing the project?      So onto the yelling part; I told her that I'm not going to do her whole project because I have my Senior Project this semester as well, and she pointed at my computer screen where she was typing, got in my face, and at the top of her lungs screamed, "YOU'RE MAKING ME SO MAD BECAU...."  And that's about all she got out, because for a long time now, I've gave in to her.  And something inside of me told me to fight back.  So I screamed back in a very evil and odd voice I seldom hear myself use, "ALL YOU ****ING DO IS TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME YOU NEED TO LOOK WHAT THE **** IS WRONG WITH YOU!"  It was the first, and probably last time I've yelled at her.  She yells at me all the time though!      I quickly realized what I did, and as I saw the tears in her eyes, I hastily tried to hold her.  I apologized countless times right then and there.  She kept pushing me off and gone to lay on my bed.  I wasn't going to hold her and force her to sit with me in here.  I sat beside her on the bed and tried to comfort her, but all she did, once again, was put me down.  I took it and felt terrible, but didn't over-react.  I just said I'm sorry multiple times once again.  She also told me that was the first time she ever felt like with any of her boyfriends that I could actually hit her or harm her, which I would never do.  This made me feel terrible, and almost suicidal.      I know I could never hurt her, and I don't understand why she doesn't realize that I never will.  I do realize I can go completely psychotic.  I played football for 12 years and wrestled for 6, I personally know what I have inside of me, I've grown to live with it.  I'm crazy when I get into that mood, I do realize it, but after that initial huge burst of adrenaline followed by loads of sweat, I'm calm and collected.      So basically, she sat on my bed and cried for about an hour, and then after that I didn't feel like arguing, so I played the "yep, I know, I'm sorry, yep, sure, yeah, I understand" bad boyfriend card again.  I felt terrible for what I did, but in all honestly I don't feel all that terrible about it looking back on it now.      The reason being, is because she's hit me countless times in the stomach when she gets mad, and me not expecting it, I'm not sitting there flexing my abs waiting, so it does hurt.  Also, the fact that over the time we've been to
