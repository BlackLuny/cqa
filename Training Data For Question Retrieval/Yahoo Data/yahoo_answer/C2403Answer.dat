ug2PnhAIaa	I don't think it ruined it for writers, just made it a lot harder.|`|hlewHaZfaa	In a way... the hp series is a hard one to top... you make some good points though seems like a dead topic now|`|AA12065466	poof away then|`|AXAyuFW8aa	No. Absolutely not. Everyone has their own style of writing. I doubt anyone would think of something like Harry Potter. Yet, the book still has stole a few points, It has many great ideas to get a writer started!|`|R0iHHPqEaa	yep because it was so good you cant top it so ha ha|`|Bb2f1Y3Eaa	Kinda, yeah, because I don't think that people want more than HP now.|`|UkOu0lagaa	I think so.

M0bE2IBQaa	Yes, and it is a children's literature book. But there is an adult version of the book. Either way, you can still read it. Bradbury's story is about a little boy's tale of his family reunion of vampires. This story was initially published in 1946 and later refashioned into further stories. Bringing this story to life are the wondrous illustrations of Dave McKean, whose delightful artwork perfectly matches the tale. It was a fantastic book, so I would recommend you to read it. :)
22BeoDsnaa	The reason why you get nervous is because writing is something personal. You're putting yourself out there.   I'm an artist and I'm the same way. I get shy showing people my work and downplay my achievements.  A lot of people see it as really great and I don't think much of it. If you're like me I'm always comparing myself to other artists and I don't think I'm as talented as them. What I realized is that there is someone out there who will always be more talented than you. If people like it than you must be better than you think! It's natural to be hard on yourself. Ask your friends what they like and what they don't like about your work, so you can possibly see your strong points. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder maybe you may not see it but others may really enjoy it and who knows it may change someone's life.

I thought it sounded strange to describe the sword as 'dead weight', considering that term is usually used for unconscious or.. dead people. I've never heard it used for inanimate objects. Maybe 'It was just weighing me down considering I couldn't fend off five, maybe more'   I may be completely wrong though.    Can't find anything else though. I like the name Faia :)|`|AA12095483	I'm listening to narrative, but I'm not feeling the action.   Instead of saying you were being chased, share the pumping of your calves, the pain in your knees, the effort to force your tiring legs to move a little faster.   When the arrow flies past your head, I'd love to hear the sound it makes. I'd like to smell the rank sweat pouring from your body. I'd love to share the metallic taste of blood in your mouth, as you bit your lip to force yourself on. In other words - you have many senses - sight, smell, sound, touch, taste - and you need to use them all to make this come alive. Otherwise it's just words.

zSEs5kUqaa	Honestly, most of the Twilight fans are Harry Potter fans and teenage girls.     IF Twilight hadn't been compared to Harry Potter on the news (Which was a publicity stunt), I would not have read the books. Twilight was almost nonexistent when  the first three books came out. Compared to Harry Potter that is. The sales were around 7 million for all three books.    Then, over the summer, you have all of the advertisement for "Breaking Dawn" and people comparing it to "Harry Potter". Next thing you know, "Breaking Dawn" is on the top of the Pre-Order list on every online bookstore.     After that, Stephenie Meyers sales 22 million books in 2008.     Twilight had been out for 3 years, but no major purchasing took place until it was compared to "Harry Potter".     Us Harry Potter fans were itching for something to satisfy our "Harry Potter" craving. There were no more books to be published and we need a "Quick Fix".     Don't get mad; all of this is true. If you don't believe me, do the research. There are tons of articles on it.      Edit:     Before you judge Harry Potter by "Stupid magic, sorcerer stuff", you should read the books. At least, try the first. You think magic is stupid, but you like "Superfast, Superstrength weilding, Telepathic Vampires?" Vampires are magic. They have immortality and extraordinary "sense" or "gifts" whichever you prefer, so how can you say "Harry Potter's magic" is stupid without actually reading them?|`|kPDLGt3qaa	I honestly don't know why... I haven't met too many people who genuinely like both simultaneously.  I used to love both. Then I reread Twilight and wondered what in the heck I was thinking the first time around, haha - I don't mean any offense to Twilighters, it just took some time for me to realize that the series really wasn't for me.   Harry Potter is my true obsession. It hasn't always been, though.     Also, I agree that you shouldn't be judgmental when you haven't actually read or watched anything Harry Potter. (However, I doubt you'd like them now that you've got the mindset and predisposition thinking HP is bad - it tends to work that way...)  But, hey, it never hurts to try something new - you might find that you really enjoy it.    Best Wishes|`|9569b9f21e2784dd7f0eed3a0b53732eaa	I loathe Twilight. The whole vampire/human thing is boring and cliche. I have no interest in the books or the movie.    But I'm a huge HP fan.|`|86oPkfzOaa	I love harry potter and hate twilight.|`|x38sIvyxaa	I'm vice versa of you. Love Harry Potter, dislike Twilight. (But please respect my opinion the way I respect yours.)  I'm a bit of an extremist fan, so I believe that there should be no crossing over. (LOL, no, I don't mean that in the prophase I sense.) In my opinion, a true Harry Potter fan loves Harry and hates Twilight, and a true Twilight fan loves Twilight and hates Harry. I really don't understand the people who enjoy both. In a world with so much literary competition, you've got to know your own preferences and you've got to pick your favorites.|`|5c079cb1c9fa7ffe7d3cdc8fa57061a6aa	i like both|`|1nC4fVw3aa	I'm exactly like you and i have no idea
245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	Technically, it wouldn't be irrelevant if you're defining the characters by the way they act around others. If two characters have this romance thing going on, the "fluff dialogue" would be rather important to developing their relationship, wouldn't it?    In my opinion, as long as "fluff dialogue" is lightly sprinkled, even medium-ishly sprinkled, throughout the story, it's absolutely fine. Otherwise, if you have more than just a sprinkle, it will show that your characters lack depth in personality. And if that's what you want, that's fine, especially if they're not the main characters, but if not, then it isn't fine.|`|TG7mwNRfaa	I would vote generally not okay. All aspects of novels are meant to advance the plot, or at least some part of the plot. I would steer clear of any conversations that do nothing to advance the plot in any way.    EDIT: Amanda-san and Lyra-san make a good point. I should have been more clear...anything that advances plot, characters, or relationships is okay. Meaningless nonsense isn't so okay.|`|CblODn2Kaa	Depends on how irrelevant. Do they add anything to the characters? If absolutly nothing can be gained excepted an increase in pages, it's annoying.|`|E9KYlG9kaa	That's fine as long as it's interesting or funny.
hwoNA90oaa	Sounds to me like the plot itself needs a little work, because once you start actually writing your book you should know where your characters fit in. Map out you story completely and understand you concept because if its foggy to you it will be foggy to your readers. Know what you characters are thriving for and when your writing your really taking your characters on a journey, bringing them from the beggining and getting them closer and closer to their objective. Of course your going to make twists so they dont get their automatically but they are eventually going to get what they want so just think of your writing that way. Take your characters on a journey.|`|bzmPe6Dvaa	you could try brainstorming ideas for the plot   where i get my ideas from is what i aspire to happen in the future or i look at my surroundings or think about my past     and if that doesent help im sure you just have writer's block right now it will come to you eventually ask for ideas from other people   think of what you want the genre of the story to be     you can e-mail me at kitdavies27@yahoo.com maybe i could give you some suggestions for your story if you tell me the character's names and a little about yourself.|`|DjCLWseZaa	That's what I started to do. I got a plot as I wrote. After a few pages, I had enough to outline with. Funny thing is, I went back and totally re-did everything at the beginning. The protagonist was asleep most of the time and you could tell I was fishing for a plot. Good luck!!!
zSEs5kUqaa	It's "Which"...:p    Breaking Dawn - the 4th - Is the best in my opinion. I won't tell you what happens though. My favorite characters are Alice and Edward.    Twilight is the second best. It's was so funny.    Eclipse is the third best. I absolutely HaTeD Jacob in it. He's very obnoxious and annoying. You'll see. I won't spoil it for you.     New Moon drags on and is so depressing. It took me 3 days to read the stupid thing; I honestly didn't want to finish it. A good writer can get across depression with rambling on and on and on and on again about it.|`|fAtgSc0iaa	GREAT CHOICE IN BOOKS!!!!    :D    welcome to your obsession *laughs*    I adore them all, major obsessed!

It was great=]    3- Eclipse..because it has a lot of happy things in it, sort of    4-New Moon- because i did not like the character that was in the majority of the movie [not Bella]    Characters..    1) Edward..of course..he will always be my favorite.  2) Bella because i am a lot like that character  3) Alice, because she's the fun one.    but i like all of the Cullens, really, except for Rosalie =]|`|yjmIrlYeaa	i personally ADORE new moon then eclipse and breaking dawn   then twilight,     so its just going to get better(=    midnight sun is very good too      not man people like new moon though    and i have to say i love emmett(he's just so funny) and jacob(the type of guy i would like but... maybe even edward )    mike is funny    and i hate leah!|`|bun3Nq3kaa	1)eclipse  2)breaking dawn  3)twilight  4)new moon  and i would say alice.|`|26ygzBVkaa	All the books expect for the middle of New Moon. *SPOLIER* i dont like the middle of New Moon because Edward left.|`|pkKnV46saa	Twilight  Eclipse  Breaking Dawn  New Moon  I've read the whole series and I like twilight the best because it was the first.

I'm going to get a lot of thumbs down for this but I hate Bella and Edward. I took some pleasure out of reading them suffer. Then again, I hated the books.  Jacob and maybe Alice are my favourite characters because they seem like the only ones that even has a shred of character in them. All the rest seem undeveloped, unfocused Mary-Sues and Gary-Stus.|`|T7o6sxq9aa	i am only on eclipse  bu ti liked twilight a lot  and eclipse is good too  new moon was not too good though|`|B5Fm455paa	The one thats ******* on fire.|`|E9KYlG9kaa	I love them all but my fav is Breaking Dawn because it is so surprising and so much happens!

That's about all I have to say, since I'm a sophomore in high school. :)  However, I really did not like Antigone. This is probably because I instantly agreed with Ismene and Creon and had a dislike for Antigone and didn't believe the 'love' between Haemon and Antigone. Oh come on. They all killed themselves over Antigone, a 'real hero,' 'obeying the gods,' oh please. She was a girl born of incest and she was an annoying brat..

Never one to run with the crowd, Bella never cared about fitting in with the trendy, plastic girls at her Phoenix, Arizona high school. When her mother remarried and Bella chooses to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she didn't expect much of anything to change. But things do change when she meets the mysterious and dazzlingly beautiful Edward Cullen. For Edward is nothing like any boy she's ever met. He's nothing like anyone she's ever met, period. He's intelligent and witty, and he seems to see straight into her soul. In no time at all, they are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance - unorthodox because Edward really isn't like the other boys. He can run faster than a mountain lion. He can stop a moving car with his bare hands. Oh, and he hasn't aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he's immortal. That's right - vampire. But he doesn't have fangs - that's just in the movies. And he doesn't drink human blood, though Edward and his family are unique among vampires in that lifestyle choice. To Edward, Bella is that thing he has waited 90 years for - a soul mate. But the closer they get, the more Edward must struggle to resist the primal pull of her scent, which could send him into an uncontrollable frenzy. Somehow or other, they will have to manage their unmanageable love. But when unexpected visitors come to town and realize that there is a human among them Edward must fight to save Bella?|`|vGCetYmAaa	why does everyone love that book so much, i looks retared.|`|3u4HU7rdaa	it's this romance novel about teenage vamps.   interesting, yet. but overrated big time.|`|HZubplhvaa	Dude.

Twilight i s the saga that is sweeping girls off their feet.  I'm actually surprised you haven't heard about it.  There are four books to the series:Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn.  It is a really good series.  Even if you don't like these type of stories, it's good to find out what all the controversy is about.

The charicters are ALL fake, I see no way anyone can say that Bella isn't a Mary Sue (google it if you do not now)    It's not acually got a plot, and yet it's so full of plot holes.    major  thesaurus abuse, and missuse of words.   Creepy lead hero: so...  someone over 3 times your age starts watching you sleep, and acually truely wants to eat you is romantic?    okay... last time I checked, super old guys stalking high school girls  was a bad thing.    ALL the charicters are 1 demenional, and their "faults" are just cute things to make then cute.  Bella's only flaw is that she thinks she's ugly (though its proven she is pretty, why would everyone in her class be asking her out if she wasn't)  and her REAL flaw is being clutsy.something that makes her cute.      and the writting style is REALLY TERRIBLE!|`|NoZAofgOaa	i hate it.|`|R2Rg9ZtTaa	Itsz about a girl that falls in love with a vampire|`|WQjDQgB9aa	LOL!

A regular teenage girl, Bella Swan, moves to Forks, Washington to live with her police man father. There, she meets Edward Cullen, a vampire with a vampire family. When he saves her from a car accident, they fall in love. It's hard for Edward because he wants to drink her blood, but overcomes the temptation because he really cares and loves Bella. And they go through adventures throughout the whole 4 books. Like, running away from a vampire whoes trying to kill her, more vampires when Edward runs away, again, run into another vampire and more. Bella also has a friend, Jacob Black, who is later a werewolf and has to balance out the relationships between the two.

You should read it.    Twilight is about a vampire and a human girl that fall in love with each other and three bad guys want to suck the girl's blood so she could be evil like her but the vampire doesn't let that happen. At last they have the baseball scene with the girl playing baseball with the 7 vampires when the 3 bad guys come to talk to them and the vampires try to hide the girl. Usually the vampires are supposed to be mean and evil but in this series the vampires help the girl and the very last book is Breaking Dawn is where the girl and vampire get married. The fifth book Midnight Sun is going to release.      The series is in this order:          Twilight          New Moon          Eclipse          Breaking Dawn                Midnight Sun- gonna release on the vampires perspective      HOPE YOU LIKE MY ANSWER|`|NVAOTIRDaa	It's a romance/vampire novel.

Bella then confronts the single vampire Edward and revealed the truth.

OY2eoWKhaa	I have it and yes, I cheated.    Wiki says:    One day Gregor emerges to the sound of his sister's violin with the hope of getting his much-loved sister to join him in his room and play her violin for him. He has a fantasy about him telling Grete that he plans to send her to the conservatory to study violin. But her rejection of him is total when she says to the family, We must try to get rid of it. We've done everything humanly possible to take care of it and to put up with it, no one can blame us in the least.    The sister then determines with finality that the insect is no longer Gregor, since Gregor would have left them out of love and taken their burden away.|`|DvToP5h7aa	The Metamorphosis - Franz Kafka    Study Guides:    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/metamorph/    http://summarycentral.tripod.com/themeta...    http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/t...
oWzkcwXBaa	Of course it's a good idea to read both modern and classic books! In most cases, reading itself is a good thing.    I think reading both gives the reader a sense of how our language and our culture develops over time. For instance, you learn about the past in history class, but that doesn't stop you from watching the news every night in order to keep up with the present. Both modern and classic novels provide an insight into the differences, and the similarities, between generations.    In some ways, modern and classic novels have many of the same basic themes: love, friendship, loyalty, and so the list continues. Classics were the originals, a foundation of sorts for modern novels to be based upon even though the story itself may differ. At the same time, modern novels are easier to understand for most of the population today because the language and the point in time is usually closer to the present. The thing to always remember is that just because they sound different doesn't mean the stories don't have the same meanings behind them.    Oh, and out of the list you chose, I'd have to say the Golden Compass. Even though I don't always agree with what parts of the book say, I can't deny that they are quite interesting and fairly well written.|`|ea411a2c44df3b7648b1c84f352a4902aa	Just so long as you're reading...that's what counts!    Mix it up, read both classic and modern literature - give different kinds of stories a chance.  It could make you think on where we've been as a people and where we may be headed.    Lately I admit I've been hitting the classics section at the public library.  I figure if they stand up to the test of time, it probably says something.  But newer, up and coming writers need their shot too.      I can't weigh in on your modern titles - I've not read them.  My son has read Lightening Thief and liked it very much.      Enjoy!|`|7xwAxMvKaa	Man! All the modern books you listed are my faves, especially the Golden compass. Over all i think modern books are better than classic books because I am a more modern person.|`|tcxB5lteaa	As William Faulkner once said: "Read, read, read. Read everything - trash, classics, good and bad, and see how they do it. Just like a carpenter who works as an apprentice and studies the master. Read! You'll absorb it. Then write. If it is good, you'll find out. If it's not, throw it out the window."    Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen is my favorite modern novel.  The Golden Compass, I guess, would be the one I would choose from that modern list.|`|iB6lWUfnaa	Yes, of course it is. I'd say The Golden Compass is the best. By the way, Johnathan Swift (in the 18th Century) wrote a book called 'The Battle of the Books" about just this idea. Of course the moderns were from the 18th century and the classic books were from ancient Greece and Rome.|`|dZyoGbUdaa	Classic books are praised as better because they have proved themselves as "good" by continually being read over the years by a large audience.  A modern book can be just as good as a classic so yes it is a good idea to read them.      add: I haven't read any of the modern books you listed

Maybe that earlier she runs into an elderly woman who says, "I know you" or something, which then she wishes to go back in history to find out what the woman meant. Like, my grandma is Chinese, but she says that I was swimming around in an ocean when I found my parents, it could be about family ties or something.|`|RhM5Mrdvaa	Perhaps earlier in the story she was being told a historicla story about a Geisha who lost her love and killed herself/died of starvation/poverty related illness because of disgrace/gossip. Perhaps Amanda could wish to go back in time and save the Geisha's life and reunite the Geisha with her lover.  Whatever you do please don't make your western character become a geisha, whatever Liza Dalby says, Western Geisha are lame and pathetic and not being japanese look terrible in kimono...

So, here's my lecture for you. Read it well, because I have copied this thread and reported your account along with what you wrote, not to Yahoo!Answers, but to the the book's publisher, Poppy.    Unless you are paying for the download or the author has given permission to post the work online for free (and most have not), I wouldn't go near it. Taking copyrighted work IS STEALING. And while you may not want to hear that it is ILLEGAL to download copyrighted material, you NEED to, because IT IS.    Book publishers are tracking illegal downloads and online viewing and are suing people (like the record industry has been doing). They are hurting in this slow economy and they are really not happy that people are stealing their product. If they can't get money from selling the book, they'll get it by suing those that steal it.    (I've made something of a hobby of reporting criminals to the publishers in recent weeks. I've already sent in the accounts of 3 people since Friday who were requesting stealing a book and admitted to knowing it was illegal to do so. I'm sure while you and they are schilling out $20,000 in legal fees you'll wish you'd just spent $14.95 to buy it legitimately. And I've saved this thread, so deleting it in a panic to cover your tracks won't matter any. Maybe you haven't done anything illegal yet, but with any luck you'll be on the watch list by morning, so just do the right thing.)    Good enough lecture for you?      EDIT: You just made yourself a challenge. BAD move.  And you are NEVER so shielded or hidden as you think you are. Especially not against a federal warrant to the servers and providers (federal as the crime crosses state lines).

If on the other hand, you feel strongly enough about it and decide you can afford to lose everything this guy can cause you to lose, allowing for some unfair moves he may make that you may not have thought of, or more consequences than you may have anticipated, then go for it with courage and resolution.    Sounds to me tho like this guy is more like a prickle bush - you may rip it out of the ground, but so what, and you'll sure get hurt doing it.  If it's any comfort. remember that aassholes are not being aassholes to annoy you personally, they just are that way.  It's a booby prize to be them, even if they seem to win the little daily battles.|`|YmtNel5haa	perhaps you should try talking to him.  Maybe he doesn't realize he is doing it or you are misperceiving his actions.  As an adult you will be forced to work with people you don't like,  and some of them will have authority over you.  This is unavoidable, but not impossible.  Talking it over with him is the only advice I can give you. Try it, and good luck.|`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	He got to put his pants on one leg at a time just like you. He doesn't sound like a good teacher. If it were me let him know how I feel and if persisted drop his class and take it with someone else.|`|spYpsixUaa	I suspect that his blustering and braggart ways are a defense mechanism.  Perhaps he is trying to conceal his feeling of inferiority?  Oftentimes, fronts of superiority are actually defenses against a low self-esteem.  Especially transparent to people who feel capable everywhere else but in the presence of their doppelganger.    Do you think that you could be this guy's doppelganger?  That would explain the nausea!    Seriously, look at how the guy acts around other people, and then consider the nature of your relationship with him, both in the past and in the present.

AA10736802	I think that you are asking about a painting by Rubens, based on an earlier work by Titian (Tiziano). The parrot that Rubens added to his painting is a large red bird, of a type native to Brazil.      At the time when Rubens made his painting, there was speculation in Europe that Brazil was the site of the Garden of Eden.  That theory was heavily connected to the abundance of parrots in Brazil.   The notion went along these lines: originally, in Eden, all the animals could speak; but they lost the power of speech once Adam and Eve committed original sin; all except for the parrots, that is; the parrots retained the capacity to speak directly with God.  With so many parrots in Brazil, that had to be the site of the Garden of Eden.    Rubens inclusion of the red parrot is therefore intended to reinforce the authenticity of his painting as truly representing the Garden of Eden.|`|b5050af6348ebc55aabde293d337fc56aa	Adam being the first person to "give the bird"
rT22hTL0aa	I'm not personally familiar with that brand, but from what I've been able to find and read about it it seems like a pretty good instrument.  It should be more than adequate for a beginner.
Et0IeGJ4aa	I would create a podium. so many great speeches have affected out lives today. you could even put words of some speeches at the bottem. like "I have a drem"
Swmd0P2uaa	So, you want your pencil strokes to be blended to a perfectly smooth, almost solid - look? Pick out the softest graphites you have, and as for paper, I would not use a very grainy/coarse paper (like news print) Go for drawing paper, rather than sketching paper. Try to find one with a nice smooth marble feel. I assume you are using blending stumps? If not, you will need those. http://cobaltwhite.com/catalog/images/29...   A good technique I have used in the past: Do not hold your pencil like you would if you were writing. You are centering all the force onto that one point, and it makes permanent impressions in the paper. Instead, hold your pencil to its side. Like you would if you were shading a large area. This means you will be primarily pushing down on the pencil with your thumb and index finger. http://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m158/...  Although you may find it hard to sketch most of your picture this way, you may find it useful! It depends on your style. For anime, rich, fluid lines are not quite as useful. But in portraiture, landscape, and many other subjects, this works well! (By forcing yourself to loosen up. you will be less likely to mess up on the details, and capture a more true, form, overall) If you are not pressing too hard, you should also be able to erase easily with a kneaded eraser. I reccomend those because you can also use them to smudge, and get that look you are trying to achieve.      Here is an AWESOME tutorial on circulism drawing. Try it! (go back to home page to see more)  http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...|`|m84nHutpaa	NO, NO, NO, NO!!!!!       Don't ever use a blending stump! or your finger! or smudge the graphite in any way!!!! please. This is an obvious sign of an amateur.!    Your pencil must be farely sharp at all times. Hold the pencil at a steep angle and shade the area lightly, over and over again, until you reach the desired value. Then blur your eyes and find the areas that seem a little lighter, and with a sharp tip... very gently, carefully, and slowly, shade the areas to match the intended value. If your picture looks 'scratchy', than be more carefull...and if you have to, shade within the scratches. It will take time, but look oh so much better.    see for yourself on my myspace page... Alan Klemm (in denver) click on my pics.    **** The pic of the girl in the black dress, is a drawing, not a photo. You can see the sketchy ones, and compare... Sketchy is not so bad... but smudgy is.!|`|vDH7CzZYaa	i don't know about that type of pencil because i use whatever pencil, but i either flatten mine out on a surface (cardboard / back of sketchbook / etc.) or i use the side of it and put in a little bit and then more and more until i have the right shade.    hope this helps! :)))|`|GeHrKxThaa	First lay down the pencil in small, circular motions instead of in a linear fashion. Try to get that layer of graphite as smooth as possible before you even start to blend. The texture of the paper will have an effect. I actually love smooth paper for both graphite and charcoal because I can blend it much more evenly and I can get a lot more detail out of it. For blending, I find that a tortillon works even better than a blending stump. It looks similar, but is pointed on only one end and the paper is wound looser. Use small circles to blend.|`|ianulrAJaa	Use a "blending stump".  Get one at any art store.  Use it very, very softly to rub the two together.  It works best of you apply the graphite softly too.    textured paper, or grainy as you call it, is the best because it allows you to lay the graphite on the surface of the paper and not imbed it into the fibers, so that you can blend it and rubb the graphite into the fibbers.  Paper that is too smooth won't grip the graphite very well, forcing you to push it in with your pencil as you draw, making it harder to blend.
XwQxKwRcaa	I think it's probably due to his "celebrity" and to his being mainstream. I don't know if critics of art really want something to be all that mainstream.
AA12339318	Best advice:  Take a class.  These are offered at pretty low cost at most community colleges and some adult education programs.    If the instructor is a qualified Adobe certifed trainer, the classroom text will be the "Classroom in a Book" series.  It is also the book I recommend for self teaching of most Adobe products.    The book takes the user through a series of professionally designed projects, beginning with some simple ones, and progressing through more complex projects designed to introduce the user to more and more of the applications tools and features.  The book comes with an included CD that contains the graphics and text needed to complete these projects.    I always recommend the people to each exercise twice.  The first time, using the resources on the CD, and a second time using their own graphics and text.  That second run through helps the student retain the knowledge gained from the first run through.  Plus, by the student having to locate their own photographic and illustrative sources, it has a more realistic, real-life, feel to is.    The problem with online tutorials is that they can only offer some VERY limited information on all of Illustrator's features.  It is an EXTREMELY powerful tool, and, if the user is not willing to put in the time and effort to learn it's full potential, it will be a HUGE waste of money.  I compare it to someone purchasing a two hundred thousand dollar sports car, only to use it to go fetch groceries.|`|645f18865ac05bd21df6fca545da961daa	one technique you can practice with is using live trace, import a portrait or flowers, something simple and nothing too detailed, run live trace to convert bitmap image to vector, remove bitmap and edit vector anchors to smooth outlines,     http://www.tutorial9.net/illustrator/ado...  http://library.creativecow.net/articles/...

AA11214261	I love the books too and I like to hear that others do too, because I feel like we are in a special club that can only understand.    My reasoning for loving the books is weird. I am 30 years old and am a serious entrepreneur who is always busy and after failed relationships, and lost loves I am no longer romantic or care about mushy love stuff. After reading Twilight I felt like I was in High School again. The writing brought me back to feeling that strongly about someone like when I was younger. The excitement and longing and the torture because love hurts. I stopped letting myself feel those things.    I couldn't put the books down, and wanted to know what would happen next so badly. It was a great feeling of escape from my life, and a wonderful feeling of utter chaos, and wishing for the happy ending.    On another note: I think guys don't like the books because they feel jealous of how we feel about Edward. Also that we see how a guys should really treat a girl.    I still re-read the books. I am obsessed.|`|0pVXLyGhaa	I don't love the characters because I think Bella and Edward are both pretty boring....... however, there are things that I do love about the book Twilight.      Basically, I love that Meyer made Bella and Edward so overwrought and emotional with each other.      When I was reading "Twilight", the plot really kept moving because of Bella's restless obsession with Edward... and it was satisfying to read her overly emotional ideas, thoughts and feelings.      It really was a wish-fulfillment book.      And I do like that about it.      Also the story plot points moved along competently.  The ending to Twilight though was quite contrived with James there just to provide some sort of plot twist, but the main fact of Twilight which is the emotional energy was strong throughout.      I don't think I'll read the rest of the series though because I honestly didn't like Bella or Edward very much....... but I respect that they were so obsessed with each other.      And it is a satisfying story in that way.|`|pOEH4HLuaa	Every girl like twilight because its "in"  & because edward is hot  very shallow  i don't like twilight but i like midnight sun more edwards point of view is way better that bella, all bella can see his his eyes, his arms and it ticks me off  edward notices everything|`|Qe9y6MnTaa	EVERYTHING!

She makes it feel like you are there too.|`|056cd57fe1506567da3828f5884632ecaa	Okay, I'll try to be as honest as possible !    I am not a huge LOVER of Twilight as many are.     But... why I do like it:   - I love YA  - I love YA supernatural (AKA YA urban fantasy)  - I love vampires  .... okay, but that's not it.     Stephenie Meyer did vampires in a different way, which was necessary (I know people complain about the sparkle, but vampire have been done to death - no pun intended).   The true love thing makes me sigh.     The parts that made me not love it:   - Bella isn't a strong enough protagonist for me. I want to LIKE my main character. (I can't stand how she lets every man push her around!)  - Breaking Dawn. Yep, the last book put me off so much that I feel like I didn't really like the whole series now.

wIOAmvlSaa	Heathcliff -  An orphan brought to live at Wuthering Heights by Mr. Earnshaw, Heathcliff falls into an intense, unbreakable love with Mr. Earnshaw's daughter Catherine. After Mr. Earnshaw dies, his resentful son Hindley abuses Heathcliff and treats him as a servant. Because of her desire for social prominence, Catherine marries Edgar Linton instead of Heathcliff. Heathcliff's humiliation and misery prompt him to spend most of the rest of his life seeking revenge on Hindley, his beloved Catherine, and their respective children (Hareton and young Catherine). A powerful, fierce, and often cruel man, Heathcliff acquires a fortune and uses his extraordinary powers of will to acquire both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, the estate of Edgar Linton.      Catherine -  The daughter of Mr. Earnshaw and his wife, Catherine falls powerfully in love with Heathcliff, the orphan Mr. Earnshaw brings home from Liverpool. Catherine loves Heathcliff so intensely that she claims they are the same person. However, her desire for social advancement motivates her to marry Edgar Linton instead. Catherine is free-spirited, beautiful, spoiled, and often arrogant. She is given to fits of temper, and she is torn between her wild passion for Heathcliff and her social ambition. She brings misery to both of the men who love her.|`|6YWz7kHDaa	no
JV6NFr5Raa	this is a freaking awesome poem!  it has pain and emotion. i can tell you are a good writer. i do have a story to relate to this but in the story i am the foolish one, the one that has what is good right in front of them but chooses what is bad.  so many people do this and are stupid. this is one of the most painful situations you can have when it comes to relationships and friendships and all that. this poem captured the angry side of the situation in a great way. I am currently watching my brother go through the same thing you did, but i think she might realize what a great guy he is in time for them to all be ok.      write more poems and such! love it!

AA12200754	Dubbing is the adoubment ceremony, by which squires and young men in arms became knights.  This ceremony began at its base from the knighting ceremony of Prince Dafydd ap Gwalchmai, of the Middle Kingdom.  Later coronations became a customized ceremony that were used throughout history by all of those ordained into knighthood.  Appearing to be a simple serene ceremony, preparation and dedication was required years before this authentic event took place where a squire was proclaimed a knight.         Knights went through a lot before they were dubbed actual knights.  The preparatory education of candidates for knighthood began at a young age and it was long and arduous.  At seven years of age the noble children were usually removed from their father's house to the court or castle of their future patron, and placed under the care of a governor, who taught them the first articles of religion and respect and reverence for their lords and superiors.  Initiated through ceremonies of a court, they were called pages, valets or varlets, and their office was to carve, to wait on tables, and to perform other menial services which were not then considered humiliating.  In their leisure hours they learned to dance and play on the harp, were instructed in the mysteries of woods and rivers, that is, in hunting, falconry, and fishing, and in wrestling, tilting with spears, and performing other military exercises on horseback.          At fourteen the page became a squire, and began a course of severer and more laborious exercises.  To vault on a horse in heavy armor; to run, to scale walls, and spring over ditches, under the same encumbrance; to wrestle, to wield the battle-ax for a length of time, without raising the visor or taking a breath; to perform with grace all the evolution's of horsemanshipnecessary preliminaries to the reception of knighthood.  They were usually conferred at twenty-one years of age, when the young man's education was supposed to be completed.  In the meantime, the squires were no less assiduously engaged in acquiring all those refinements of civility which formed what was in the age called courtesy.  The same castle in which they received their education was usually thronged with young persons of the other sex, and the page was encouraged, at a very early age, to select some lady of the court as the mistress of his heart, to whom he was taught to refer all his sentiments, words, and actions.  The service of his mistress was the glory and occupation of knight, and her smiles, bestowed at once by affection and gratitude, were held out as the recompense of his well directed valor.  Religion united its influence with those of loyalty and love, and the order of knighthood, endowed with all the sanctity and religious awe that attended the priesthood, became an object of ambition to the greatest sovereigns.          On the eve of the knighting it was customary to give the candidates a vigil.  This was a time for reconciliation, speaking with the chivalry, peers and wise nobles present.  Also a time for introspection to consider the responsibilities and joys of accepting the accolade.  At 10 p.m. the vigil began a roundtable on chivalry, where those present would discourse on the meaning, exemplars, symbols, duties, and responsibilities of knighthood and peerage.  This round table would be moderated by the candidate's Knight and continued until midnight.  Thereafter a time of prayer and contemplation commenced, when ancient, wise, and grave gentles came singly and in pairs to instruct the candidate in the ways, honor and history of the orders of peerage and knighthood.         The candidate fasted on the vigil and prayed unto God, confessing his difficulties that he had done against God.  He stayed awake all night and said his prayers and he out to have heard the word of God and things touching the deeds of chivalry. Before being dubbed a knight, the candidate bathed in order that felony be washed away and be fulfilled with courtesy, honesty and kindness.   The candidate was claded in white next to his skin, that he would hold himself clean, chaste and pure of heart and mind, and then wore a cloak of red that symbolized understanding and consideration that he would be required to spill his blood in order to defend his God, his King and his people.  The candidate wore shoes and hose of brown and black so that he would always have in mind death, and earth to lie in low.          He then repaired to the church where the ceremony was to take place, bearing a knightly sword suspended from his neck, which the officiating priest took and blessed, and then returned to him.  The candidate then, with folded arms, knelt before the presiding knight, who, after some questions about his motives and purposed in requesting admission, administered to him the oaths, and granted his request.  Some of the knights present, sometimes even ladies and damsels, handed to him in succession the spurs, the coat of mail, the hauberk, the armlet and gauntlet, and lastly he girded on the sword.  He then knelt again before the president, who, rising from his seat, gave him the accolade, which consisted of three strokes, with the flat of a sword, on the shoulder or neck of the candidate, accompanied by the words:  In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make thee a knight; be valiant, courteous, and loyal!  Then he received his helmet, his shield, and spear; and thus the investiture ended.         A knighting is perhaps the defining moment for combatants who have worked for years trying to improve their prowess and their understanding of the other knightly virtues.  For many, not even a victorious Crown Tournament carries the same power.  Although the ceremonies created differ in content from their medieval counterpart, if done well their power creates a nearly mystical experience not only for the candidate, but for all who witness the cerem|`|8ZZb1Cm0aa	It is when you are knighted - I dub thee Sir...

They have a 'wanted' section for this stuff and you can find someone locally who will do it.    However...    I am a portrait artist, and take it from me, very few people realize how much work goes into a finished piece of art; and hardly anyone wants to pay us for the hours it can take to produce a finished product.  Please-please-PLEASE consider that a professional artist is a highly skilled technician of the brush and they need fair compensation-- not opporitunities to work for pennies on the hour.    And, while I've got your attention?  Why a photograph?  Do you know how amazingly flattering it can be to have a drawing from life, where you are posed and the artist makes sure all of your best features are captured?  Even the best photo falls a bit flat compared to what a studio portrait can do, and most portraits from photos are more difficult and less successful than life drawings.  Get someone local who you can meet and make this a REAL indulgence!  :D
09579cbf1bdbe5e121916faccfc1eeecaa	my against cloning and mostly stem cell research here are my reasons.    1. if you actually clone an entire human body for transplants would you treat it as a human or as an object? (watch "the island" and this is a key point in the movie)    2. if you just clone the organs this would mean that a very rich person can literally their body like crap and then when liver fails just pay a fine and get a new one. the person basically can live forever.    3.to get the stem cells for cloning they need aborted fetus. who is more likely to get an abortion? the poor or the rich? basically they will target lower income families to abort their baby so that they can clone. think of another thing.    lets say that an abortion cost 500 (no idea just guessing)   rich guy is losing liver wants a clone. total procedure cost 5,000. doctor charges the guy 50,000 for operation. that's a big gap.    and robert j cloning does exist. they have clones sheep and cats. they just haven't moved to humans yet.|`|AA11162050	Most times it does not work.

WrmyeMtMaa	Dr Suess was really Theodor Suess Geisl.  he was born in Springfield, MA and graduated from Dartmouth college.  He studied for his doctorate but instead married his wife and did not complete that.  He was hired to draw cartoons and write humor for a magazine called "The Judge". "And To Think I Saw It On MUlberry Street was his first book written on a ship.  It was rejected by 43 publishers before being published. During WWII he joined the ARmy and was sent to Hollywood where he wrote under Frank Capra. He won Oscars for Hitlers Lives and Design for death.  Geisl was inspired by a Life Magazine article about illetracy in children becuase children said the books were boring.  He married his second wife in 1967 and died in 1991.    His book Green Eggs and Ham was written over a bet that he could not write a book using only 50 words.  He won the bet.    My first book I ever owned and learned to read was Green Eggs and Ham.

9H8TW9f2aa	abstract visuals~no question about it.|`|r1EG9S2Uaa	Look up the school catalog for Art Center in LA, California. This is the top art school in the country and only takes the best new artists. They offer  classes that have a good income potential after you graduate where you can work in a field that pays well and is suited to you.   What happens to most artists is that they have no business sense. To work in any field professionally you have to be able to get the work out and on time.   I suggest looking into another filed altogether: Art Licensing. the top art licensing artists make (get ready for this as I am not kidding) many many million dollars a year. Mary Englebrite was  reported in License Magazine  to have earned off her artwork and 6000 licenses almost 100 million in 2005. And the best part is that these licenses keep paying and paying as long as the product is being sold.
6aa826250a977c3f1d49328b4ce117ecaa	Su nacimiento se situa el 29 de Septiembre, 2 A.C.   Si hoy 15 de abril del 2007 es domingo, calcula 2009 atrs!    La cristiandad celebra la fiesta de la Navidad del 24 al 25 de diciembre. No obstante el 25 de diciembre del a?o cero no es la fecha autntica del nacimiento de Jesucristo. Se olvid tener en cuenta el a?o cero que deba ser intercalado entre el a?o uno antes y el a?o primero despus de J.C. Adems no se contaron los cuatro a?os en que el emperador romano Augusto haba reinado bajo su propio nombre, Octavio.    El A?o del Nacimiento de Jess  Por el otro lado, el a?o en que Jess naci es ampliamente aceptado como vlido en el a?o 4 A.C., debido a las conclusiones errneas derivadas de la datacin que Josefo diera a un eclipse que se supone tuvo lugar en Marzo 13 AC. "poco antes de la muerte de Herodes". Hay varios problemas con esta aseveracin adems de que este eclipse con toda probabilidad tuvo lugar en Diciembre 29, a?o 1 AC. Esto es un considerable lapso de tiempo transcurrido entre el nacimiento de Jess y la muerte de Herodes, dado que la familia escap a Egipto huyendo del edicto de Herodes y no regres sino despus de la muerte de ste.[4] Lo que es ms, Herodes muri en Enero 14 ANTES DE CRISTO. [5]     Hecho: Tertuliano, (nacido cerca del a?o 160 DC) declara que Augusto comenz a gobernar 41 a?os antes del nacimiento de Jess y que muri 15 a?os despus de ese evento. [6] Augusto muri el 19 de Agosto del a?o 14 DC, situndose entonces el nacimiento de Jess en el a?o 2 AC. [7]     Hecho: Tertuliano hacer notar, asmismo, que Jess naci 28 a?os despus de la muerte de Cleopatra, en el a?o 30 AC, lo que es coincidente con la fecha del a?o 2 AC.    Hecho: Irineo, nacido aproximadamente un siglo despus de Jess, tambin comenta que el Se?or naci en el a?o 41 del reinado de Augusto. Como Augusto inici su reinado en el oto?o del a?o 43 AC, esto tambin apoya al a?o 2 AC como la fecha del nacimiento de Jess.     Hecho: Eusebio (264-340 DC), el "Padre de la Historia de la Iglesia", la describe en el a?o 24 del reinado de Augusto y el 28 a partir del sometimiento de Egipto a la muerte de Marco Antonio y Cleopatra. [8] Para comprender esto, debemos tomar en cuenta que el a?o 42 del reinado de Augusto comienza a correr desde el oto?o del a?o 2 AC hasta el oto?o del a?o 1 AC. El sometimiento de Egipto por el Imperio Romano ocurri en el oto?o del a?o 30 DC. As, si el 28avo a?o se extiende del oto?o del a?o 3 al oto?o del a?o 2 AC, la nica fecha que se ajustara a esto sera el oto?o del a?o 2 AC.    Juan el Bautista  Hecho: Otra forma de determinar la fecha del nacimiento de Jess es obtenerla de la informacin acerca de Juan el Bautista. Elizabet, la madre de Juan, era prima de Mara y la esposa de un sacerdote llamado Zacaras, quien era de la "clase" de Abas. [9] (Los sacerdotes eran divididos en 24 clases [10] y cada clase o turno, oficiaba en el Templo por una semana, de Sabbat -el Sbado judo- a Sabbat.)     Cuando el Templo fue destruido por Tito el 5 de Agosto del a?o 70 DC, la primera clase de sacerdotes acababa de comenzar su servicio. [11] Dado que el curso de Abas era el 8avo, podemos rastrear hacia atrs y determinar que Zacaras termin su servicio el 13 de Juio del a?o 3 AC. Si el nacimiento de Juan se efectu 280 das despus, debi haber sucedido entre el 19 y el 20 de Abril del a?o 2 AC, precisamente para la Pascua de ese a?o. El nacimiento de Juan y el de Jess estuvieron separados por 5 meses. Por lo tanto, de nuevo tenemos como resultado el oto?o del a?o 2 DC como fecha probable del nacimiento del Divino Maestro.     Hecho: Juan inici su misin el a?o 15 de Csar Tiberio. [12] La edad mnima para un ministerio de este orden eran los 30 a?os. [13] Como sabemos que Augusto muri el 19 de Agosto del a?o 14 DC, entonces podemos aseverar que ese a?o ascendi al poder Tiberio. Si Juan naci el 19 o 20 de Abril del a?o 2 AC, su trigsimo cumplea?os debi haber sido el 19 o 20 de Abril del a?o 29 DC, es decir, el a?o 15 de Tiberio. Esto parece confirmar por s mismo, la fecha del 2 AC y como Juan era mayor a Jess por 5 meses, esto confirma tambin a oto?o como la poca del nacimiento de ste ltimo.    El que Juan presentara a Jess repetidamente como el "Cordero de Dios" [14] resulta interesante dado que Juan fue nacido en la Pascua.     La fecha exacta  CONCLUSIN: Elizabet se recluy por cinco meses y entonces el Angel Gabriel anuncia a Mara, tanto la condicin de Elizabet as como que Mara dara a luz un hijo que se llamara Jess. Maria fue "de prisa" a visitar a Elizabet, quien se encontraba en ese momento en la primera semana de su 6o mes de embarazo, en la 4a semana de Diciembre del a?o 3 AC. Si Jess naci 280 das despus, esto sita Su nacimiento el 29 de Septiembre, 2 A.C.   Si hoy 15 de abril del 2007 es domingo, calcula 2009 atrs!  El da 25 de diciembre es mencionado por primera vez como festividad de Navidad en el a?o 354. Bajo el emperador romano Justiniano, es decir, 527-565 despus de J.C., y fue reconocido legalmente como da festivo. En sta eleccin de desempe? un papel importante una festividad de la antigua Roma.

e96d05e892c367e02cb0bdfc3541ec47aa	verdad verdadera        El rbol de los Amigos  Existen personas en nuestras vidas que nos hacen felices por la simple casualidad de haberse cruzado en nuestros caminos.   Algunas recorren el trayecto a nuestro lado, viendo pasar mucha lunas, pero otras apenas las vemos entre un paso y el otro. A todas las llamamos amigos y hay muchas clases de ellos.   Tal vez, cada hoja de un rbol caracteriza a uno de nuestros amigos. Los primeros que nacen del brote son nuestros amigos papa y mama, que nos muestran lo que es la vida.   Despus vienen los "amigos hermanos", con quienes dividimos nuestro espacio para que puedan florecer como nosotros.   Pasamos a conocer a toda la familia de hojas a quienes respetamos y deseamos el bien.  Adems, el destino nos presenta a otros amigos, que no sabamos que iran a cruzarse en nuestro camino.  A muchos de ellos los denominamos "amigos del alma", del corazn. Son sinceros, son verdaderos.   Saben cuando no estamos bien, saben lo que nos hace felices. Y a veces, uno de esos amigos del alma "estalla" en nuestro corazn, y pasa a convertirse en un "amigo enamorado". Eso da brillo a nuestros ojos, msica a nuestros labios, saltos a nuestros pies.   Por otra parte, tambin existen aquellos amigos "por un tiempo"; quizs por unas vacaciones o unos das o unas horas. Ellos suelen colocar muchas sonrisas en nuestro rostro, durante el tiempo que estamos cerca.   Y hablando de cerca, no podemos olvidar a "amigos distantes", a aquellos que estn el la punta de las ramas y que, cuando el viento sopla, siempre aparecen entre una hoja y otra.   Nuestras hojas, varias nacern en otro verano y otras permanecern muchas estaciones.  Pero la que nos deja mas felices es aquella que cayeron, que continan cerca "alimentndonos" con su amistad. Son recuerdos de esos momentos maravillosos, cuando se cruzan en nuestro camino.   Te deseo, hoja de mi rbol: PAZ, AMOR, SALUD, porque cada Persona que pasa por nuestra vida es "NICA" y siempre deja un poco de SI y Se lleva un poco de nosotros.   Tal vez haya quienes se llevaran mucho, pero no habr ni una sola persona que no deje "ALGO".

gAWWyDLhaa	First, write your story.    Edit your book several times to make it the best it can be, type it in proper manuscript form (visit http://www.writersdigest.com to find out what is needed), consider joining a local writer's group to get feedback from other would-be writers, and get it proofread by someone who knows what they are doing (don't rely just on spellcheck). Edit it some more.    There are a tiny number of publishers that accept unsolicited manuscripts (those that don't go through a literary agent), so getting an agent first is a really good idea.    At the library or bookstore is Guide to Literary Agents, published by Writer's Digest, or Bowker's Literary Marketplace (or visit http://www.agentquery.com). Look for agents that specialize in your genre, and are looking for new clients. Read, and follow, their submission guidelines. In those books will be something about writing a query letter, which is what you send to the agent, first. It's part synopsis of your book, and part explanation as to why your book deserves to be published. You have only that one-page letter to wow the agent, so take the time to make it a good one. Expect the whole process to take lots of time, and expect many rejections. When you are accepted by an agent, they will send your book to publishers, not you. The whole process is free, except for postage, until your book is bought by a publisher. That is when the agent gets their cut (usually 15%) of the money which would go to you.    If you decide to self-publish, then you will pay (potentially up to a couple of thousand dollars, depending on which publisher you choose).     Good luck!|`|38eb78ef54653766c3ca71d79051901caa	Type your question into the search bar where it says "Search for questions:"    You will get a list of hundreds of the same exact question.

dfuTjy8Eaa	The easiest way to approach this is to think of causality, or, cause and effect. Determinism can be many things, but most commonly it is seen as this relationship: effects are 'determined' by causes.     A cue ball hits the eight ball sending it into the corner pocket. Here, the eight ball's direction, speed etc are all 'determined' by the speed, direction etc of the cue ball.    When we translate this to human action (usually in a debate between 'freedom' and 'determinism'), the idea is that no human is capable of free choice or free action. There are many ways of arguing for this, but the current, easiest way to do it is to argue that everything you think and feel is an 'effect' of the 'causes' in your brain. So, every memory you have, every thought, everything you think that you are deciding, is really being decided for you by the firing or neurons, and synapses in your brain.     Fatalism is an extreme version of determinism that says free will is logically impossible because of such things as cause and effect - but in the strongest sense. Think 'fate' here. Nothing can be free because it is all 'destined' to do causally specific things.     The line I choose to defend is not that they are compatible, but that freedom depends on determinism. This may confuse a little, maybe not, but essentially the argument is that without several factors that 'determine' you, you can never be free in the first place. For instance - you have no choice in the body you were born with, or the place you were born, or your skin color, nationality, etc. These are deterministic forces (better understood as constraints). However, given these situations, and by accepting them and making them your own, you can go on to think, reflect, decide and act in a meaningful way that is free nonetheless.     I hope this helps you get the picture a little better. Cheers!|`|NaM4ZT64aa	Determinism is the philosophy that all events can happen in only one way because everything that happens is the direct results of events occurring directly before them, back until the beginning of the universe.  Therefore, we have no free will.    Here's an example.  I decide to eat a sandwich.  Let's go through the reasons why I "decided" to do so.  It may seem like it was my personal choice, but in reality, it is not.  It is dependent on my having ingredients to make a sandwich (in turn dependent on grocery shopping at a previous time, which was dependent on previous need and other factors), my hunger from not eating recently, genetic makeup determining that I both like and am capable of eating sandwiches, etc.  As Baruch de Spinoza said, "Men think themselves free because they are conscious of their volitions and desires, but are ignorant of the causes by which they are led to wish and desire."    Consider this scenario.  In a container with different air currents blowing through it, a rock is dropped.  The air currents move the rock around as it falls until it hits a specific spot at the bottom.  If this is repeated, the exact same results will occur, provided that absolutely nothing is changed.  Regardless of how many times this is repeated, the rock will always strike the exact same spot in the tube.  As Einstein said, "The definition of insanity is doing the same thing multiple times and expecting different results."  If you think about, a human making a choice is no different from the falling rock.  Each are affected by external factors, yet there are no other possible outcomes.  So long as the factors remain exactly the same, the outcome will always be exactly the same.  No matter how many times it is repeated with identical factors, I will still eat the sandwich.    The common retort to this is that if the sandwich-eating scenario is repeated, I may change my mind because I know what the experiment is.  This, however, would not be the same factors.  Prior knowledge and environment are the two most important factors when it comes to decision making, so altering these would mean that the factors are different.    Basically, determinism shows how everything that happens, even our "choices," are all based upon cause and effect.    P.S. If anything, determinism is the epitomal opposite of chaos theory.  Chaos theory is a description of how everything is open to chance, whereas determinism shows how everything is preordained based upon causation.|`|07b8313b7096ade2a84057ef85256e06aa	My interpretation; though i've never heard of this before is that:  It is like the "Chaos Theory" where a butterfly's flight or flap of a wing could cause a hurricane on the other side of the world. In a way, it could be like that where one thing affects the outcome of another, even if it's indirectly. For instance applied to human interactions, it could be that a suicidal person who has been tampered with could do something harmful to many people, even though they did nothing wrong to the suicidal person. It's indirect, but it's a link.|`|BAhaT2U3aa	Basically it's the idea that all things that are going to happen are predetermined. Anything that will happen, will happen because of previous events.     For example you might think that you have the free-will to do anything, but what you end up doing is predetermined by the type of person you are, what's going through your head at that particular moment, your life experiences, etc.    It isn't saying that the things in the future can be predicted, as that would require knowing the current state of every piece of matter in the universe, but it's saying that if someone did know that information they would be able to predict.    Sorry if you still don't understand, it's very difficult to explain, and I'm probably not the best person for the job.|`|lQMCENkRaa	Determinism; The short version:    There are too many factor in the universe to calculate them all.   If you could, you would know how the rest of time would play out.     But you can't know that, there's just too much.     There are just too many atoms for us to count, and too many atoms to know where each one it going.    So the universe seems crazy and random.   But it's not. It just seems crazy and random.|`|Mnm35sjNaa	Determinism is a fatalistic belief that EVERYTHING (and I mean everything) is predestined.    The Bible and Qur'an are deterministic scriptures. They claim an all-powerful Creator-God who knows the future and controls everything. These scriptures didn't understand the question of free will versus determinism because the question wasn't fleshed out until around 400 A.D., when St. Augustine developed and advocated the doctrine of free will (he understood that without free will, we have no responsibility to God).    The concept of free will first emerged, in the 4th century B.C., from the concept of freedom, which Socrates and Plato elucidated somewhat. Aristotle added a moral element to free will. Even then, the doctrine of free will, in all its ramifications, took a while for others to work out in just its basic form. At the time of Jesus, free will was still a fuzzy concept. The church was established in 326 A.D., after the Council of Nicea in 325 A.D. Clearly, as the council decided what to include in the bible, free will was not part of their thinking.    On the other hand, science is also deterministic. It's a discipline built on the belief that everything is physical (matter or energy) and operates on physical principles -- most notably, causality (cause and effect). Science has a history of fundamental paradigms (like "God has created a perfect universe" or "everything is physical") being supplanted by new paradigms as advances in understanding are gained. Human consciousness and intelligence (and many say, free will) are glaring anomalies to the current paradigm. Quantum physics is a strange realm where the act of observation changes reality. "Data" is factoring into more and more of theoretical physics. It seems to me that the next paradigm shift in physics might well accommodate human intelligence itself and free will (free agency). Actually, it would be more accurate to say "compatibilism" than "free will". For more (from the field of neuroscience) on this notion, check out one of the leading theories of consciousness called, "The CEMI Theory". Just Google it.    Determinism is usually mentioned in contrast to free will. Compatibilism is the belief that free will is compatible with determinism. To me, this is the most viable explanation for human reality.

She knew it wasn't exactly a palace but given the circumstances that her family was in, she thought this attic could very well indeed save everyone's life.    Her mother and sister Margot were uncomfortable at first because they were still getting over the shock of what they had left behind. However, as the weeks progressed, they realized cooperation was the key, so they too tried to make the attic as homely as they could make it.
xOh6IXWsaa	I've not read it myself, but The Road by Cormac McCarthy is supposed to be pretty good. A friend suggested it to me a while back, and she said it was good.|`|BGU3VpQFaa	You should definitely try The Road by Cormac McCarthy, post-apocalyptic.  Its unlike anything i've ever read before.    Its even won a Pulitzer Prize, its that good!|`|045b416d188c238fdb9551f85c247982aa	The Road is good, but very sad. McCarthy does offer hope in the book, but very little of it.    The Pesthouse is also good, but not nearly as well-written as The Road.    For non-literary straightup Sci-Fi I'd reccomend The Postman by David Brin. (Let's just forget they ruined it by making a horrible movie) The book is actually really good.    Book 3 of King's The Gunslinger series --The Wastlands could be considered post-apocalyptic. And it's the best of the entire series in my opinion.

iBQ0LF4Daa	Hegel is hard to put in a nutshell.  First and easiest he assisted Marx in his dialectical method.      A-----------B           l           l          C    Where A represents something positive that necessitates B, its contradiction.  These two collide forming C, which is something different than them and something that embodies them (in a negated form).  So Feudal Lord and Feudal Servants collide forming Bourgeois society.      That is the simple, very simple, side of Hegel.  Hegel believed in what is called immanent critique.  He would take a supposed starting point of Western philosophy and rigorously take it to its logical fullness, then he would show how that starting-point did not live up to its own demands.  He would then take an new starting point that would implicitly consume the earlier negated starting-point and start the whole process over again.      Okay, so much for methodology.  He wrote Phenomenology of Spirit supposedly during the Napoleonic wars.  He was tracking what he called Spirit, or a better term might be Total History.  He noticed that great men were great not by virtue of some inner strength per se, but because they fulfilled the need of history at the time.  Napoleon wanted to become ruler, he wanted power, but in order to get that power he had to do what History needed.  He had to solve the contradiction that history had produced, thus moving history forward.  History is a process of totalisation.  This takes the form of knowledge.  Spirit moves forward to work out all of its contradictions and know itself through and through.  This is why it is idealistic (philosophical sense of the word), because history moves due to the contradiction in a sort of infinite Subject.  There is much more.  Hegel is notorious for being one of the most difficult thinkers in the Western Intellectual Tradition.      If you are interested in Hegel for the sake of Marx, I would recommend that you read Hegel's Master and Slave section in Phenomenology as well as his section on Absolute Freedom in Philosophy of Right.  Marx, like most great philosophers, picks and choses what he likes of Hegel, so the bulk of Hegel's thought it left out.  I would also recommend reading the infamous Preface to Phenomenology of Spirit if you are ever interested in Derrida.      One last note on Marx and Hegel:  Marx inherited the German Idealist tradition that was perpetuated by Hegel.  He was part of the radical leftist wing of Hegelian followers in his youth.  He filters much of Hegel through Feuerbach, so it would be useful to read something of Feuerbach's and then Marx's published response to him.  Hegel appears to have two periods in his writing, the adventurous writing of his youth, marked by romantic enthusiasm and leftist ideology (Phenomenology), and the conservative philosophy of his old age (when he was commissioned by the government), (Phil of Right).    John Russin's text on Hegel is quite good and quite readable.        One last funny story.  Schopenhauer taught at the same university that Hegel did and he hated him so much that he schedule every single class at the same time as Hegel's to ensure that he did not receive a single one of Hegel's students.  The result was that Schopenhauer had no one in his classes.|`|dfuTjy8Eaa	Wow. Hegel wrote a TON of work ranging nearly the entire range of philosophical matters. He dealt with logic, nature, history, religion, politics etc etc, and on and on.     However, I think it would be fair to say that his main work is The Phenomenology of Spirit. In ithe argues (and describes) the way Spirit comes into existence and moves through stages from infancy to maturity. What is Spirit? The scholarship is greatly divided on the answer to this question. Some think it's God - but that idea is far to simplistic for Hegel and I don't think that it's an accepted interpretation. Others think it's critique, ie. the progression of humankind's ability to question. Following Robert Brandom, I see Spirit as the progression of human understanding (comprehension), by way of the development of conceptual content (eg thoughts, beliefs, etc) and its dispersal throughout society. If you ever pick up this book, be prepared and do not feel bad: many people have dedicated their lives to understanding it, even only parts of it.    Another famous, but much more accessible work is Philosophy of Right (or Elements of the Philosophy of Right). In this work he lays down his theory for the State as the ideal type of institution that can best allow for proper ethical life - more accurately, he sees the development of the State (the largest, most encompassing institution) as ethical life itself. This book is much easier to read and understand, leading me to believe that his Phenomenology was poorly written (as did Goethe). However, you can really get into it, and Spirit's progression is present in it as well.    From what I can read in the Phenomenology, the most obvious point that Marx latches onto is the idea of finding yourself in your work. Hegel introduced the idea of having to find your 'self' in the 'other' (quite a famous idea), and for the slave (versus the master or lord) can manage to find this 'otherness' in the things he creates. By transforming nature into something else - for instance by creating a sculpture - part of the slave is preserved in the sculpture and he can 'see himself in it'. Simple idea but it has a lot of implications. Essentially, by working on and transforming nature, you can escape nature itself (ie find a free, rational will instead of pure animality or acting solely from necessity). Marx clearly took this up: material circumstances are the essence of what creates a subject (self) for Marx and he took this to be the most crucial aspect of human existence.     In a very large part, Hegel influenced Marx with the idea of dialectic, although it's much too complex to go into here. But it is important so if you like just look up Hegelian dialectic and Marxist dialectic, there is TONS of work produced on this subject.     What is interesting though is how Hegel influenced Marx, and then what sparked his move away from Hegelian theory to his own. Everything was going well in Marx's life and, understandably, he was very into Hegelian and German Idealism (think: "everything will be great!", pure positivity). However, apparently he lost his job, girl etc. and the state was nowhere to be found - this is when Marx turned away from idealism and went in his own direction. This story was told to me by a prof last year - I didn't double check the source or anything - at least it's kind of an interesting anecdote.     I hope that helps, but really your question is MASSIVE. sorry for the rant, but hopefully that gets you closer to an answer than before.
ceBTTCPwaa	The Grapes of Wrath is a novel published in 1939 and written by John Steinbeck, who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize for Literature. It is frequently read in American high school and college literature classes. A celebrated Hollywood film version, starring Henry Fonda and directed by John Ford, was made in 1940; however, the endings of the book and the movie differ greatly.    Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath at his home, 16250 Greenwood Lane, in what is now Monte Sereno, California. Set during the Great Depression, the novel focuses on a poor family of sharecroppers, the Joads, driven from their home by drought, economic hardship, and changes in the agriculture industry. In a nearly hopeless situation, they set out for California's Central Valley along with thousands of other "Okies" in search of land, jobs, and dignity.    http://www.bookrags.com/The_Grapes_of_Wr...    http://www.bookrags.com/notes/gow/    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/grapesofwr...    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...    http://www.novelguide.com/TheGrapesofWra...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...    http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Interspersed with the chapters about the Joads are chapters that describe the historical context of the Dust Bowl and of the California migration.

Many went to California.  They were very poor and had a hard time making things work.  Back then, I believe, it tended to be a derogatory term as well.  Everybody in Oklahoma, usually born and raised, calls themselves okies at some point.|`|8bTder08aa	My grandpa, who owned his own general contracting business in Sonoma, CA, used to tell his grandkids when we did something ill-mannered, that we were "behaving like Okies."  (This was in the late 1950's-early 1960's.)      I cannot begin to tell you the scorn and contempt that he put into the word "Okie."  I didn't know what it meant, I thought the word was "Oakey," like an oak tree, and I always thought it was some kind of troll or ogre from a fairy tale, something rude and ugly that lived in oak groves or something.    Then, in school, years after my grandpa died, I learned what/who "Okies" were.  I can tell you that my grandpa, who encountered Okies in California, considered them to be disgusting, almost animals.  Sub-humans that no decent person would ever want to be like or even be around.  He had total contempt for them.    I think it's pretty fair to say that represented the attitude of most of the people who lived in and around Sonoma at that time.  Grandpa was pretty open about his contempt, which infers to me that his attitude was not something unusual or extreme.|`|wRsSodTAaa	Oklahomans-- people from Oklahoma.|`|6StMUFgkaa	Don't make something easy, hard.

AA11442722	Ben Franklin was one of the most influential men in the last 500 years. A scientist who developed several inventions and discoveries, the biggest being in weather. Franklin was also a major philosopher including his contributions to the Constitution and almanac. The first noted American writer. Franklin also developed the dry kind of wit and writing that would mark most American writers until the 1900s, especially Twain.     Franklin was a crucial figure in the American revolution as well as helping design many of America's systems after the revolution. Having developed institutions like the post office for example. Franklin was also one of the first strong abolutionist in America.     Hard to find a better choice than Franklin. Thomas Jefferson is another I'd suggest as he was probably the most influential man in the creation of the Constitution and Bill of Rights.     Albert Einstien is another choice you might consider. It'd give you a chance for a really flashy miniture musuem. Artifacts could mostly be abstract ideas about the nature of time and space.

OocDN5evaa	While I've never heard of exactly that sequel storyline, I have always heard rumor of there being some type of sequel. I know for fact that J.D. Salinger had no published worked passed 1965 - meaning that even if there is a sequel, he certainly didn't write it.     Looking online, there are some amateur  attempts at creating a sequel. The one that is most common starts off,     "Another day another school...I thought about this new school they placed me in. They said I will like it. Well I'll be the one to decide that. Next thing I know I'm on a 6:30 train to Windsor, CT."     It's obviously not the work of J.D. Salinger, but it's somewhat of a sequel. The only other piece of work that I've really ever come across that could arguably a sequel would be Charles Bukowski's novel, Ham on Rye is said to be a response to The Catcher in the Rye.    Hope I helped. Read on, read on.

AA11442722	Was less unhappy about him as unhappy with starving to death. Russian Boyers held most of the power under the weak Czar who was mostly described as well meaning but reclusive.  Russia's government wasn't especially brutal for the times but the people were deeply impoverished and had been so for generations. The aristocrats unlike in Western Europe were still in power and the class system that Marx so bitterly hated was still very much alive in Russia at the time.     WW I was not a popular war with the people but soldier revolts were it's only major contributing factor. Soldiers conscripted for the war rebelled. They later joined forces with Marxists but it was not Marxism that caused them to leave their posts.  Marxism was far from the only revolutionary group in Russia either. A strong Democratic movement was around as well. Marxism however crushed the dozens of other movements.     In short it was a combination of very unhappy people. An opportune time and the fact that Marx's theories had not been tried on a large scale yet that led to the death of the Tsar and his family. Had Democracy been given a chance instead of undermined by the Marxists the Tsar would have survived the change in government and become much like the royal families in the rest of Europe. A figurehead only. The bloodthirsty Marxists killed millions. Anybody who had too much money was killed. The aristocrats. Political enemies, anybody who spoke out against them and eventually even themselves as power struggles ensued. A nation born with the blood of children as happened with the Soviet ascension to power and the slaughter of the Czar's children was a sure sign of a nation that would bath in a river of it's own people's blood.

Jobs that actually require young children are extremely few and far between and have a LOT of children with eager stage moms competing for them, and jobs that call for a high school-aged actor typically go to young-looking 18-20 year olds so that nobody has to deal with child labor laws.     If you're under 18 and aren't blessed with some sort of connection into the Hollywood system, the best thing you can do is just stick with school and/or community theater shows for now. Get yourself some private voice and dance training, even if you aren't planning on doing the musical thing; the stuff you learn carries over into straight acting.     When you're done with high school, go to college and get yourself a performance degree of some sort. There you'll get the training you need to compete, plus hopefully make the professional connections you'll need to kick off a solid career.|`|4qVXodtnaa	There is no specific age - you can be any age, but many actors and actresses will semi-retire when they think they are getting old.

Rockefeller:  (Noteworthy phrases and words will be ALL CAPS)      JOHN D ROCKEFELLER (18391937)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Roc...  "John Davison Rockefeller...was an American industrialist and philanthropist. Rockefeller REVOLUTIONIZED the PETROLEUM industry and DEFINED the structure of modern PHILANTHROPY."    "Rockefeller kept his stock and as gasoline grew in importance, his wealth soared and he became the world's richest man and FIRST AMERICAN BILLIONAIRE, and is often regarded as the RICHEST PERSON IN HISTORY."    "Rockefeller spent the last 40 years of his life in retirement. His fortune was mainly USED TO CREATE the modern systematic approach of targeted philanthropy with foundations that had a major effect on MEDICINE, EDUCATION, and SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH."    "His FOUNDATIONS pioneered the development of MEDICAL RESEARCH, and were instrumental in the eradication of HOOKWORM AND YELLOW FEVER."    "Rockefeller adhered to total abstinence from alcohol and tobacco..."    ~~~~~~~~    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Roc...    * Note the comparison of his life and his father's in this section.  John D Rockefeller would ultimately prove his father's desire to avoid hard work by becoming as successful as he did.    * Note that after his first job, he said that when he retired he would give 10% to charity, possibly from the example of living a vagabond existence put forth by his father.    * Between 1855 and 1868, just 13 years, he went from being an assistant bookkeeper to part-owner of the largest oil refinery in the world.    ~~~~~~~~    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Roc...    * Rockefeller had a business authoritarian style about him.  As he went along his life, his business, called Standard Oil, practically engulfed the competition, adding their numbers to his own.  Wikipedia states that all he had to do was show them "the numbers" and make an offer.  If they refused, he told them he would run them out of business and buy their assets at auction.  In actuality, he was being quite generous to them by informing them of a less profitable future and offering them more money in the present as opposed to merely waiting and saving money through auction.    * Rockefeller became the grandfather of many of the oil companies that are in existence today due to a Supreme Court ruling that Standard Oil Trust was in voilation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.

He enlisted the advisory aid of his son and Frederick T. Gates for philanthropic purposes.    "As his wealth grew, so did his giving, primarily to EDUCATIONAL and PUBLIC HEALTH causes, but also for BASIC SCIENCE and THE ARTS."    * With his advisers, he created the conditional education grant for students.  He also gave to many colleges, including "Yale, Harvard, Columbia, Brown, Bryn Mawr, Wellesley and Vassar."  He completely and totally altered the course of existence for the small Baptist University of Chicago by donating $80 million dollars prior to 1900.    * He devoted much money to medical research despite his leanings toward homeopathic medicine.  Several institutes and foundations were created at this time.    * He had two great ambitions in life that time ultimately limited him to one while greatly enhancing the other.  He wanted to live to be 100 years old, which he lost out on when he died at age 97, but went well above and beyond the $100,000 that he wanted to make as a youth.    ~~~~~~~~    Note the irony between the first line of a poem written about him and his father's intense desire to avoid plain hard work:    "I was early taught to work as well as play,"    ~~~~~~~~      Best of luck!

There is a cetain freedom in having nothing left to lose.There is a point in time that you have nothing else to do but die. You leave the stuff for someone else to use, to maintain, to fix, to carry it, to dust it, to deal with, to be enslaved to, and when Death comes,  Pain finally leaves !

EOwxpAD6aa	I am sure that Edward did feel sympathy for Rosalie. I do know that at first when Carlisle found Rosalie, Edward was not as supportive as he maybe should have been. But, he still was nice to her and treats her as his sister. Emmett was the one that really helped Rosalie.|`|FE4B8uynaa	On a Sense level i think he did. Edward was probably hearing all the rage and emotion going trough Roses head not really wanting to hear it. I think maybe when he heard everything she was thinking and remembering all the crap those men put her through he felt horrible. And he must have felt horrible when she didn't have any privacy to think alone.    people say Edward only feels anger and love and thats all, but if her felt love, he would feel sympathy too. Even though he didn't want her to join their group he wouldn't be so hateful on that level, especially knowing she was thinking about it over and over.I maybe think he felt some guilt for the pain she felt and for knowing way too much only she knew.    I don't think he tried out comfort her but maybe he did give her a welcome prep talk but with a little attitude cause what she was thinking. Edward didn't hate her, he just didn't want Carlisle making their family bigger. And Rose hated him for not having interest in HER.  so deep down i think he loves her but is not in LOVE. ya know?     my opinion is so confusing sorry :]|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	How much did he have to hear?  As soon as it happened she was turned into a vampire as was consumed with the newly-turned vampire blood lust.   I'm not really an Edward fan. He seems to think he's superior to the other vampires.

A lot of readers don't bother to look deep enough or even try to understand why she is the way that she is. I think Edward probably did feel bad for her... after all, she WAS raped and bashed.    I would say that Emmett made things better for her.|`|Swmd0P2uaa	Although I loved Twilight, I think Miss Carisa is on to something (as you are too). Edward didnt display much emotion besides love and anger, if you really look at what was the main factor behind his thoughts.      The closest the author gets to portraying sympathy is when Edward desides not to share Rosalies secrets with Bella- or anyone else. Which is actually more like GUILT. He keeps her thoughts private, because he knows he has no right to hear them in the first place. Of course this is probablly just common decency. Also- it is revealed at one point that Rosalie has always wanted Edward to have romantic feelings about her, and this seems to be the reason they have kept a distant relationship.      However, I still think none of this adds up to any kind of sympathy.|`|WnG55RAlaa	i love rosalie    why does everyone hate her?|`|6nJKfktTaa	At first no, but once daddy really got through Auntie Rosalie's center minded (no offense Auntie) he really did see her pain, and saw that was the reason she acted. Auntie is really misunderstood. She is so deep and passionate on many levels and she has had a very hard life till she found Uncle Emmett, who can still make her life hard. But she has taught me many things and for that I love her, and truly got to see the other true side of her.

AA11236094	This is a poem from a new Irish poet, in a copyrighted collection, for which she won 2 international prizes.    Why do you want to add a line or a phrase to another person's work?
VOZWgWgLaa	The First World War brought out the worst of the forces that had been steadily gnawing at Tsarist Russia for years.    The Russians had little in the way of maintaining a modern army. They had more troops then any other European Army, yet they did not have enough rifles, cannon, and ammunition to adequately supply them. In going to war with Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Ottoman Turkey, all of the routes from which the allies could easily ship them supplies were blocked. The Baltic by the German High Seas Fleet, and the Bosporus by Ottoman shore guns and the Gallipoli peninsula. This left Russia dependent on her own industry, which was not sufficient enough to fight a major war against three powerful enemies, while your most important allies do not share a common border.    Corruption within the Russian High Command, and to a certian extent in the Tsar himself. Most of Russia's Generals were nobles who held Generalships because it suited the Russian Court, not necessarily because they were skilled. There were open rivalries between various Generals. The Russian Generals Rennenkomf and Samsonov hated each other, and they were to cooridinate the 1914 invasion of Prussia. At the same time, Nicholas II acting on bad advice from men Rasputin took over the army and proved unable to turn the tide, and largely ignored the advice of more experienced officers. Nicholas II also failed to draw the people behind him. His government promised an easy victory, that the Germans would fall before the "Russian Steamroller". Then, after Tannanburg, the Russian army was broken and soon in retreat. As a result, the people lost faith in their government and blamed Nicholas II for not only the defeats at the front but the losses suffered as well.    The poorness of Russia's road systems. Good roads were needed, not only to supply the army, but to also to move food from places like the Ukraine to the major cities. Russia's roads and rail systems were poor and barely fuctioned before the war. With most of the men sent to the front to fight, there were no people to run Russia's transportation network, and over time, there were no farmers. With no food, the army and the people starved, which was soon blamed on the government which was not suffering in any visible way.    At the same time, there is also the Tsarist Rule that is to be remembered. The Tsars ruled Russia with just as firm a hand as Stalin ruled the Soviet Union. Men were killed, exiled, arrested, and tortured for various crimes against the state. This bread resentment of the Tsarist Government by the people who would soon turn to anyone speaking against the Tsar, and attempts on the life of the Tsar was nothing new by 1917. At first it was Alexander Karensky, who wanted to make Russia a constitutional monarchy with power vested in Duma, not the Tsar. But, he tied up his fate in winning a battle in the war, and used up the last of Russia's available strength. When that failed, the Russians turned to a man the Germans had sneaked into Russia from Switzerland. Vladimir Illych Lenin. Lenin would seize the opportunity in the wake of the war and the resentment of the Tsar and the failure of Karensky. He took power and signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, taking Russia out of the First World War. He would then spend the next several years to insure that Russia would be a Communist country.|`|uX5hO3d8aa	World War 1 was a huge contributing factor to the Russian Revolution.    World War 1 resulted in the deaths of millions of Russians. Czar Nicholas II made himself the highest ranking officer in the Russian Army and personally formulated Russia's war operations from the safety of his palace. His inability to direct combat and win battles led to millions of casualties. Even though the war was largely unpopular, Nicholas refused to back out, angering the Russian population.    So World War 1 reduced the faith that the Russian population had in their ruler and angered the population, making it a major factor contributing the unrest preceding the Russian Revolution.|`|b3456135bf4f0f591eca2857f5c90758aa	It piled more misery on an already exasperated nation many starving to death there was no love for the Tsar after the massacre at the winter palace of peaceful protesters who only went to see the Tsar to hand in  petition looking to him as their father figure, and were attacked by the Tsar s private Cossack army . From then it all went down hill , first losing the Russo Japernese war then millions dying in the first world war tipped the balance against the Tsar and his family , And with the Bolshevik offering Communism as an alternative they  revolted and the revolutionaries took over.|`|9Dd5gxWwaa	As the others have already contributed very extensively, I'll just put it simple: when everything is going wrong (economy, life conditions, politics, etc.), and all of a sudden, military defeat is added to that, the situation can explode. The First World War was the breaking point of a lingering revolution.

I think maybe you should try reading at least the first one and see what you think, be careful, cause your niece might say "told ya so".    EDIT:   cole i was so right. perfect answer.|`|n7hezV5aaa	The film was just a brief brief summary of the book. Well, the book is written from Bella's perspective and she's really easy to relate to, so girls tend to really get into the storyline and project their own selves to the book. Even though the book's been out for years, now that the film came out there's all this hype. I don't believe there's a teenager out there that hasn't read those books right now and is obsessing about them (well actually there are some who loathe the books, but that's mostly because they love Harry Potter books more). Anyway, it's really an easy read if you're so curious as to why there's all this commotion and since you liked the film!

Meyer presents an idealized version of love that many girls/women want and can only dream about.

lTWq5ReLaa	Qart-Hadast (Carthage), the capital city of Carthage also bore the same name, and that was where he was born. Contrary to what was answered above, there was no city called "New Carthage". Qart-Hadast itself means "New City" in Punic, the dialect of Phoenician spoken in Carthage. Carthage was founded by Phoenician settlers.    Hannibal was one of the sons of Hamilcar Barca. He had several sisters and the brothers Hasdrubal, Hanno, and Mago. His brothers-in-law were Hasdrubal the Fair and the Numidian king Naravas.    "Barca" means "Thunderbolt".     Hannibal's name in Punic was actually "Annobal", which means - "Baal (top Phoenician deity) has given me grace".    Hamilcar conquered Hispania (Spain & Portugal). The only colonies controlled by Carthage prior to that were small territories adjascent to the sea. It was during this time that Hannibal lived in Hispania - during his father's conquests.    Perhap's Hannibal's most famous victory was at the Battle of Cannae. During the course of the battle, he shaped his forces into a thin crescent, with Celts (Central Spain was inhabited by Celts during that period, Carthage recruited many Celts into their armed forces) and Iberians (Spaniards) comprising of the central flank. He kept the African and Punic forces as a reserve force, slowly covering all sides of the Roman military, until they completely surrounded them. What followed was a chaotic slaughter. The Romans had a strength of 86,400 troops, while Hannibal had a strength of 56,000. 45,500 Romans perished in that battle. It was one of the most bloodiest battles in history.|`|AA10729675	Carthage, which still exist in TUNISIA.  Carthage is not part of Tunis.

Hannibal originally found at the ancient city-state of Capua in Italy. he was consummately skillful in the use of ambuscades.  we see two contending generals avoiding each other, occupying impregnable camps on heights, marching about each other's flanks to seize cities or supplies in their rear, harassing each other with small-war, and rarely venturing on a battle which might prove a fatal disaster

A Twilighter is someone who likes the books by the name Twilight Saga by Stephenie Meyer.    Now a Moonlighter from what I think is the series called Moonlight. It's about a vampire who is a detective who drinks blood he gets from the hospital. He's in love with a woman he saved when she was five, I think. I love the series though, and I can't believe they stopped it.    Now it's either that or you're referring to New Moon of the Twilight Saga. A New Moon fan, I suppose, is someone who is rooting for Team Jacob instead of Edward since the book revolves around Jacob and Bella's relationship.    Or a Moonlighter is someone who not only has a job, but a second one as well.

It is sometimes known as Tudor - as an extension of the reign of the House of Tudor - from the wars of the Roses to the ascension of James I - when it becomes Jacobean.|`|swL7bQfAaa	The Tudor period usually refers to the period between 1485 and 1603, specifically in relation to the history of England. This coincides with the rule of the Tudor dynasty in England.

Making history from the moment of her birth, England's Queen Elizabeth I (1533-1603) was a legend within her own lifetime. To her supporters, Elizabeth I was Gloriana, the Faerie Queene, a dignified and powerful woman who ruled with cunning and skill for forty-four years. To her detractors she was the ruthless supporter of a false religion; the murderer of her cousin Mary Queen of Scots; a wanton woman, herself illegitimate, who sullied the crown with her licentious behavior.|`|G2JHunHjaa	Tudor or Elizabethan|`|AA11167036	It's called the Elizabethan period|`|vleQLpBhaa	You could go for "The Golden Age of England"    Under her rule, England started to compete in Mercantilism and the Age of Discovery.

lTWq5ReLaa	Rwandan Patriotic Front.     Grgoire Kayibanda, the first President of Rwanda, overthrew the Tutsi-led monarchy, and started the 1959 "Social Revolution", which was nothing but ethnic purges against Tutsi people. Many Tutsis fled to Uganda, where they became refugees. Uganda had many tough refugee laws, many more were later passed by Milton Obote, which resulted in harsh conditions for them. This ended with Idi Amin's coup, although the Tutsi refugees split into two groups, those pro-Amin and those anti-Amin, the latter who went to Tanzania.     After Amin was overthrown, The refugees in Uganda started the Rwandese Alliance for National Unity (RANU), which was an intellectual forum to discuss a possible return to Rwanda. However, Milton Obote returned to power, due to a rigged election, and the Ugandan Bush War began. Many Tutsis joined Mutsevini (Obote's guerilla oponent), as a result, Obote claimed that the guerillas are mostly Banyarwanda (Hutus and Tutsis - there are many Hutus and Tutsis native to Uganda, the country controls a part of the Great Lakes region). A failed attempt to force all Tutsi refugees into the refugee camps in February 1982 resulted in a massive purge, driving 40,000 refugees back into Rwanda. Rwanda declared that they recognized only 4000 of these as Rwandan nationals, while Uganda declared that they would take back only 1000. The remaining 35,000 were left in a legal limbo along the border region that lasted for years, from where many refugee youth left to join the Musevini's National Resistance Army (NRA).    Musevini won. Kampala fell to the NRA in 1986. Two of the 27 people in the raid which began the Bush War were two Tutsis:  Fred Rwigema and Paul Kagame. Musevini completely changed the policy of Uganda towards the refugees: All were made citizens.    In December 1987, RANU held its seventh congress in Kampala and renamed itself the Rwanda Patriotic Front. The new RPF, dominated by Banyarwanda veterans of the war, was far more militaristic than the original RANU    On 1 October 1990, the Rwandan Patriotic Army(RPA), the armed wing of the RPF, deserted their posts in the Ugandan army and invaded northern Rwanda. After initial gains in threatening Kigali, the offensive was turned back by Zairean and French troops sent to reinforce the Habariyamana regime. The RPF suffered a major setback when Rwigema was killed in the second day of the war and was forced to retreat in disarray into the mountainous border region. There the RPA regrouped under Kagame and began a classic insurgency campaign. The war reached a stalemate and the two sides entered into peace negotiations. These talks resulted in the signing of the Arusha Accords in 1993 to create a power-sharing government.    The Rwandan Genocide began after the assassination of president Habyarimana on the 6th of April, 1994. The Rwandan Patriotic Front split into two groups: one political, and one military. The military outfit, RPA (officially called RPF) went on a full scale attack against Rwanda, as a response to the genocide. The RPF controls Rwanda till this date. Paul Kagame is the President of Rwanda. The RPA was renamed to "Rwandan Defence Forces", and is the current military of Rwanda.|`|SupWrLRIaa	Rwandan Patriotic Front
AA11585502	I have checked several sites including google, amazon, imdb, yahoo biography and they all say the same thing "In 1976, Hayden appeared in Bernardo Bertolucci's Novecento, and also published the historical epic Voyage: A Novel of 1896. After working infrequently over the course of the following decade, he died in Sausalito, CA, on May 23, 1986, at the age of 70."  None of the sites have any reference to the novel ever being made into a motion picture.    I even wen through the list of films on IMDB titled voyage and looked at what they where about and none of them are about his novel....    Sorry to inform you.....hope this helps

8W2Yx240aa	Well, I can see your nickname is werewolf willis...    So what you could do is write as if you were a werewolf, and you could talk about the lust for power, and the unrestrainable animal urge that encompasses who you are... if you want to tap into emotions of the females of your class, think of writing about this woman who is so beautiful and you want to be with her, internally your character wants to love her, but he knows that he would endanger her life!! So you can express the passion and the obsession you have with her.... and then in the end of the monologue you can say how you lost control and the lust for her overwhelmed you and your strength and animal aggression killed her, and since you will live forever you will have to live with the regret of killing the woman you loved...    but that's just an idea!    hope it helps!    sincerely Stephanie|`|fnPyq2iqaa	.

That is, the first line needs to be very interesting. For example, try something like: "Forty years ago, the world would never had conceived that its collapse was imminent."     That would hook an audience and keep them in your story because they want to know how the collapse happened. And in a good story, you never TELL the reader what's going on. You DESCRIBE what goes on.     I hope that helps.

7948d322583be173cb825c04b51e58b2aa	Let's say I give you two equations that both take input and give the same output.  Equation one is extreamly complex and time consuming, and equation two is simple and fast.    Which one would you rather use.  They both give exactly the same result, so it would only make sense to pick the easier one.  That is the point of Occam's razor.      Whitehead is also right.  Why is the simplier equation work so much faster and better?  Perhaps we only think that it gives the same results?  The correct answers to life's problems are rarely simple.|`|wLwNIxPpaa	this is an extension of inductive reasoning    so if you know this then you will understand Occam     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_r...    just think of Sherlock Holmes when he puts all the peaces together he does so in the simplest fashion where every thing is fluid.|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	That is nowhere close to what William of Occam actually said.  Occam's Razor states:  "Pluralitas non est poneda sine neccesitate", which is a warning against unnecessary complications, or assumptions, rather than a defense of over simplification.  It also mentions nothing about trust or distrust, so the reason it makes no sense to you is that you are mistaken about what it actually says.|`|XxDQGEalaa	I can't think of an example...but Occam's razor is really about an efficiency with assumptions, not a simpler explanation.

So they could have started faking being cursed by a witch and loved the attention they were getting.  Also, fueds, jealousy and prejudice between the two parts of Salem could have caused people to accuse others as witches.  There is also a theory of ergot poisoning because it was in the area around that time due to the climate and could have gotten into the rye bread they ate.

It is something which mingles both the Unconscious (the Unknown) with the desires and feelings of anyone who is unable to master these somewhat troubling, but powerful urges from the Unconscious.    When a situation provides that two people meet, there are a lot of unknowns. The past, the set of values, the family background, financial past, lots of issues must be explored before a "modus vivandi" (a way to live together) can be found. These must be explored in the context of relationship. Under a normal and considered circumstance, where two people have a good relationship with the Unconscious, have mastery over their lives and impulses, then each person learns to trust the other, and more can be revealed as intimacy develops progressively.    With those who are obsessive or compulsive, many of these steps are mistakenly skipped; mastery of self gives over to an overrated belief in synchronicity, belief in a beyond and so forth, forgetting all the while that personal choices are being made, just not as consciously as a stable relationship requires.    When the course of an obsession is followed to its own conclusion, many dramas and misunderstandings arise and create larger problems than can be handled within just the resources of the relationship, since intimacy and trust have not yet been fully established.  Do the two people share the same values?  If no one took the time to fully investigate, usually by just watching how a person solves the problems of living, one of the two will disappoint the other.    The more quickly the investigation is over, the more likely several steps toward trust and true intimacy have been discarded in the belief that passion means more than lust. Some obsessed people believe that no one will love them. They don't recognize the possibilities of love in the smaller, less dramatic details of life's problem solving puzzle. They want the full score of music, the dramatic "eyes met mine," and skip over the logical and measured investigation of how another person solves the problems of their lives.      One outcome is broken agreements.  Two people agree to share an apartment. Rent is paid on time for a short period, but one of them starts falling short in their responsibility.    Why is this occurring? Mostly, the harder-working and stable person entertains a belief that trust has been established before they learned about how this person solves life problems. The less responsible party has found a reliable sort of person to solve their own problems. The first party might have waited longer to determine the values of his proposed partner.  Disappointment ensues after a too-brief investigation.    Maturity and self-knowing are an integral part of learning about relationship; romance, taken alone, can never answer all the necessary questions.    Delaying physical intimacy can enable the conversation about values and trust to arise first, and is useful to serious people seeking a partner with whom to establish a long and happy household.    Obsession, usually mistaken for "passion" is a also way of avoiding the sharing of truthful information, and serves to mask motivations and values. Obsessions and compulsions prevent a logical building process.     If two equally obsessed people are attracted to each other it will not take long for the structures which each assumes to be in the other to begin breaking down.  They can play at it for a while, but it will become too soon exhausting. Shoring up another person's inadequacies will be costly in terms of finance or health, emotional life or happiness.    Anyone who says they have an obsession would do well to work with a therapist to get at the bottom of the intensity. Such drives do not make a relationship, but instead allows someone to be a greater-than-human type who sees no need for humility or understanding.    Much tragedy ensues when obsessions and compulsions are not made conscious. As these drives exists in the Unknown, they have a greater chance of being harmful to another person. When someone allows themselves to be controlled by these impulses, they remove a personal and human connection to their actions. They do not take responsibility for their own actions and often blame God (or gods or any seemingly convincing argument) for their destructive bent.  Yet, any jury will always rule that irresponsible behavior cannot be explained or justified by beliefs alone. Society requires each person to respond to the situation made by their own decisions.    When a relationship is allowed to be driven by obsessive or compulsive impulses, then one or both must suffer the powers of the Unconscious which can be very cruel.|`|1lOzRfT1aa	Sounds like beautiful music between two people has started|`|f821e891c77524cf69e50d2bb5629d7faa	with obsession comes anger with the thought of losing the other, nothing can come out of anger in a positive way and most things come to a crash near the end.

ceBTTCPwaa	Homer's Odyssey :     The Odyssey is one of two major ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer. The poem was probably written near the end of the eighth century BC, somewhere along the Greek-controlled western present day Turkey seaside, Ionia. The poem is, in part, a sequel to Homer's Iliad and mainly centers on the Greek hero Odysseus (or Ulysses, as he was known in Roman myths) and his long journey home to Ithaca following the fall of Troy.    http://www.bookrags.com/Odyssey    http://www.bookrags.com/notes/od/    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/odyssey/    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...    http://www.novelguide.com/odyssey/index....    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...    http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...    http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T...    http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/pte...|`|DvToP5h7aa	The Odyssey by Homer Written 800 B.C.E    Study Guides     http://www.mythweb.com/odyssey/    http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/h...    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/odyssey/    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...|`|nOptuKgsaa	there are many definitions of sirens but they pretty much look like the hotest girls on earth but are really ugly monsters that feed off men or their souls and how they draw men is to sing their hypnotic song so they feed while the sailors want to get jiggy cuzz remember when u sail by sail its months or years and they urn for sex and would u go to a girl who said that she was gonna make man stew with u|`|Swmd0P2uaa	The question of WHY the sirens sing to the men, is a question with so many answers, no one knows one solid answer. I think the importance of this part is not WHY they sung, but WHAT the author intended for us to gain from this excerpt. The the Sirens actually reveal a lot about the the character Odysseus. *His emotional loyalty to his wife -and Ithaca, as well as his faith in himself.* They help the author develop the Odysseus into a more complex- multi faceted character.  Maybe you can start by analyzing their attraction- It is hard for us to see this (because times have changed so much) but it was more THEIR WORDS that lured the men, than their actually song. They promised the men honor and glory, two of the most IMPORTANT things the men could ever achieve in their life times. They promised they would be immortalized in memory, to be spoken of through out the ages.     Some theories as to why the called to the men include cannabalism. However, I do not buy into this because I have read that the bodies of men decayed and rotted at the sea stones. Men who died trying to make their way to the Sirens. Perhaps they did eat the mens remains? They could have called to the men simply because they knew they could attract them. They revelled in the power to control men so completley. Which brings me to another interesting question. Why did the author portray the women of the book as villans? (and not just the Sirens) Also: it is said that "a siren dies if a man resists their charm". So, maybe they simply sang because their lives depended on it? Or maybe they had so much pride in their game ....     I think your teacher gave you a stupid question to write about. This is like trying to answer which came first- chicken or egg? Who cares! The more interesting question is, WHY are they important in the story? WHY are they portrayed as bringers of death? Is there symbolism in these femme fatales?    PERSONALLY, I think this was simple- Hero overcomes obstacle. And the Interesting part of the Sirens was that the were WOMEN! Women were thought of as unlucky, a part of nature, unpredictable, ILLOGICAL creatures, ...
AA11442722	Mexico still mad about Texas suceeding and even angrier that Texas joined the US pushed a border dispute that went back to the end of the Texas revolution.  Texans claimed all the way to the Rio Grande. Mexico claimed Texas ended a few hundred miles to the East of the Rio Grande. Since hardly anybody lived in the region at the time it was more of an academic issue for decades.     Then two things happened. The French Pastry war in Mexico propelled Santa Anna back into power. The other was expansionist policies taking hold in the US.  The Mexican government renewed claims on parts of land that were considered part of Texas by the US. The US wanted to expand to the Pacific and sparsely populated lands claimed by Mexico blocked US expansion to the Pacific.     So the US sent some troops down into Texas and stationed them in the disputed area. Mexican soldiers attacked them launching a war both nations were due to fight but that the US was badly prepared for. The US hit Mexico with two forces, both poorly financed. One of the US commanders paid for most of his troops supplies out of his pocket, the other paid a good chunk of it but had some Federal support. Both generals had ambitions on becoming president and saw the war with Mexico as a springboard for that.     The Mexicans had a large well trained army but lacked leadership. In fighting plauged them through the whole war. It was not a popular war with either country's citizens but it was most telling in Mexico where most of the battles were fought. American armies rolled through Mexico suffering very light casualties until they hit Mexico city where Mexican soldiers made a determined stand. The Irish brigade and the Mexican military acadamy cadets being the two most famous and resolute stands in Mexico city.     Mexico after surrendering was forced to acknowledge the American version of the Texas border. Santa Anna to pay for the costs of the war sold additional land to America giving America a free path to the Pacific.|`|u653DtGGaa	the us won

IOD6czfxaa	So you think you can dance is show basically all about dancing.    They start out by going across the country, doing auditions in different towns trying to find Canada's or America's best/favorite Dancer. When they get all the people from auditions, those who the judges liked are brought to call-backs, and go to Hollywood I do believe if your American, or Toronto if your Canadian. Once there for a week or so, they do many different dances with some of the top choreographers, in styles like Hip-hop, crumping, street style, ballet, modern/lyrical, salsa, quickstep, jive, etc. During this week the judges pick the top 20 to come and continue to compete.    In the performance round, the 20 finalists (now placed in couples)chosen to dance, and each week America/Canada votes (depending on which ones your talking about) for their favorite couple. When the next show is on, the 3 three couples with the least amount of votes dance for their lives and are given a chance to perform solo routines to encourage viewers to keep them on the show. The judges then decide which dancers stay in the competition and which two are eliminated.     Once it gets down to the Top 10 finalists, it's solely up to America or Canada to decide who remains in the competition. Following the performance shows, viewers can vote for their favorite couples. The live results shows reveal who keeps dancing and who goes home.     In the states I do believe that the prize for being Americas Favorite/Best Dancer is $250,000 and in Canada it is $100,000 and a   Mercedes.    Abreviation is SYTYCD.    Hope this helps!|`|sz2SatQ9aa	SYTYCD(so you think you can dance) is about dancing! many people audition and if they are really good they a ticket to go automatically to the top 100. others will get sent home straight away if they are bad and if they are ok they go to choreography where they learn a dance and then perform it in small groups to the judges. the judges will then pick some of the dancers to get a ticket.    then they choose top 40(not to sure) and again they perform in groups. then i think they pick top 20 and then they actually get to pick a partner and perform it infront of a crowd! then the top 10 will automatically go on tour and then the winner gets a prize!!|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	One of those dance shows on TV|`|FyrRDGqiaa	best dance show ever!!  dancers from all across the country are narrowed down to 20 dancers who are then partnered up and not only do they have to be awesome at their own dance style but they draw out of a hat what "style" they learn together for the next week and must excel at that too.

ype5N1qEaa	Don't sink at the end.  I see many of my students anticipate their landing . By this I mean that if they are doing a triple, their first turn is nice and pulled up, the second not quite as much, and by the third their spot isn't as sharp, their leg is already coming out of passe, and their eleve is dropping.  Thinking about finishing your turn but staying in a perfect passe.  If you think "up" throughout your turn your landing will be much more controlled.    Personally, I visualize an upside down tornado when I pirouette.  My first turn is wide and then each turner gets tighter and higher as I go.    Keeping your back engaged and your torso square is also key.    Mostly- practice practice practice and refuse to make the same mistake over and over.  Be smart, if you are falling out to the right, then you need to make sure the right side of your body is lifted and tight, if you are falling back, get your weight forward over the ball of your foot.  Don't just fall to the right, try again, fall to the right, try again, fall to the right.... Where you fall will reveal your weakness    Good Luck|`|M0vYaDEFaa	Hi. A good tip is as soon as you come up into your pirouette pull everything up as if someone attached a string to the top of your head and is pulling you completely straight. That way everything is in perfect alignment and you will be able to make it all the way around without falling over and can land gracefully. Also, make sure your spotting and that your arms are tight, like your holding a beachball. Hope it helps.|`|9ac7f6c1bf93d03c18e4ababdea89f4caa	Make sure you aren't torquing or winding up with your arms. A take off like that will give you an out of control turn which makes it harder to land. Be sure you have proper placement...even one thing out of line will mess up your turn. For singles, think of balancing, not turning. This will give you a nice controlled turn and help your landings. Practice facing the barre and going to passe and rolling down(as opposed to slamming your heel down) to a slow controlled fourth position landing. Your issue might just be a strength or resistance problem that a few extra excercises like this could help.  Ask your teacher after class to tell you what you're doing wrong.     Start in fourth position, with arms and legs. Plie slowly with resistance, and use your arm that's in front to 'wipe off the table' before simultaineously closing to first with your leg in passe. Spot the corner and try not to get freaked out as you go around which will cause hopping. Just sail around and as soon as you make the revolution, gently bring your passe back down to stick the landing.    Don't look at the floor, 'sit' in your plie', stick your ribs out, lift your hip, or come down off Demi pointe during your turn. Keep your head and eyes level when spotting and your body tight and held, with your passe leg as far side as possible and your arms in a clean position. Instead of landing your turn, try to balance in passe before coming down. Again, all this takes strength and coordination. I hope these tips help you!|`|0cf4Qja5aa	The challenge may seem like the landing, however it is generally caused by your preparation prior to the execution of you turn.    Be certain that your hips remain even when you open to second position and when you plie and take you Fourth position that your hips remain in proper position. (You can pactise centre floor and simple releve' on to demi pointe and practise your preparation without turning)  Seeing how stable your preparation of feet, arms and head has allowed your position of demi ponte to be)    It is all in the preparation.|`|Kgav4sM6aa	hold your center pull up and if u feel like your coming down pull ur pa-say higher don't drop your arms and spot dont look down full relivay dont bend your supporting leg  and start with bothe feet on the floor.. all of these|`|AA11329839	Well, first off, try working on your pirouettes at the bar, balancing and making sure your feet are pointed, back straight, stomach in, and head up.  Then, try it without the bar. Remember to spot and everything else previously mentioned. If you can master one pirouette, with a graceful landing and technique, try going on to your doubles and triples. i know you can do it!! :]

Sorry I don't know any Armenians but from the depictions of them in movies and on tv they seem to be darker skin, hair, and eyes.    Yo peeps...multi-racial means 2 or more races. So, like black and white or Asian and white, or black, white, and Asian, etc.  By today's standards Armenian is not a separate race, only a nationality. There are differing opinions of the specific breakdown of races but it seems that there are usually considered to be 4 main ones, white/Caucasion, black.African-American, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic. It gets tricky after that. If you want to know more try Wikipedia, etc.|`|AA12343309	You are definitely multi ethnic but not necessarily multi racial. All of those people are considered Caucasians.

Armenians are known for their eyes in both the almond shape and the size. Shades of Armenian eyes varies Armenians have brown, greeen, blue, gray eyes so that doesnt amke a difference.    Armenians dont have tiny noses but they dont nec. always have huge noses either...the average girl armenian nose id say is Sirusho's. She hasnt had surgery.    Armenians whether they are stick thin or have meat on their bones always have a booty!    also armenians have nice facial features like the cheek bones and the chin.
zZY3JX30aa	Egg. Chicken came from egg laid by proto-chicken|`|JhvqUvlsaa	The chicken came first =)|`|9CEW093maa	An egg will not hatch without proper incubation. So it had to have been an Asexual Chicken.|`|AA10655022	egg|`|eXaI4xnsaa	eggsperts say that its the egg      Now a team made up of a geneticist, philosopher and chicken farmer claim to have found an answer. It was the egg.    Put simply, the reason is down to the fact that genetic material does not change during an animal's life.    Therefore the first bird that evolved into what we would call a chicken, probably in prehistoric times, must have first existed as an embryo inside an egg.    Professor John Brookfield, a specialist in evolutionary genetics at the University of Nottingham, told the UK Press Association the pecking order was clear.    The living organism inside the eggshell would have had the same DNA as the chicken it would develop into, he said.    "Therefore, the first living thing which we could say unequivocally was a member of the species would be this first egg," he added. "So, I would conclude that the egg came first."    The same conclusion was reached by his fellow "eggsperts" Professor David Papineau, of King's College London, and poultry farmer Charles Bourns.    Mr Papineau, an expert in the philosophy of science, agreed that the first chicken came from an egg and that proves there were chicken eggs before chickens.    He told PA people were mistaken if they argued that the mutant egg belonged to the "non-chicken" bird parents.    "I would argue it is a chicken egg if it has a chicken in it," he said.    "If a kangaroo laid an egg from which an ostrich hatched, that would surely be an ostrich egg, not a kangaroo egg."    Bourns, chairman of trade body Great British Chicken, said he was also firmly in the pro-egg camp.    He said: "Eggs were around long before the first chicken arrived. Of course, they may not have been chicken eggs as we see them today, but they were eggs."    The debate, which may come as a relief to those with argumentative relatives, was organized by Disney to promote the release of the film "Chicken Little" on DVD.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	The egg, because millions of years before chickens existed, dinosaurs laid eggs!|`|ni7Qgt3Raa	The red one|`|kNAcutL0aa	God created chicken in the beginning|`|MlgxVr0saa	the chicken or else there would be nothing to sit on the egg and keep it warm... bamo..|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	wow how original|`|lU0vkHK2aa	Chicken, 'cause the little chick would have died after it hatched|`|bEbkV69naa	Well, the egg got laid; the chicken strutted, flapped its wings, and crowed waking everybody up.

KLFVEUtGaa	You are definitely not to old to dance!!  Do exactly what you said.... Take as many dance classes as you possibly can!  And when you are not either in school, eating or sleeping, Dance!!!!  If you really want to become an awesome dancer that's all you have to do.... want it badly.  This is the motto i go by "eat, sleep, dance"  :)  Hope I helped! And have fun dancing! I know I do!|`|0cf4Qja5aa	Hi HIGH! ANNAAA!    Michael Phepls had to be concerned about achieving his goals in a short window of time.  To achieve his legendary status as the greatest Olympic swimmer of all time it demanded concentration, the ability to adhere to the rigor of the training schedule of an Olympic competitor.    You are fortunate to be considering a career in the discipline of Fine Art.  The grains of sand of in the giant Water Bong of Life are far more forgiving toward those who chose a career in the arts rather than that of a professional athlete, especially those with their eye on the Gold and their eye on the Gold.     ANNNAA! As long as you can breathe youll never be too old to dance. When the flesh becomes weak with age it will be time to mentor those who can carry on the process.    Warm thoughts    Safetymax out!|`|Kgav4sM6aa	you are def not to young to dance we have kids that are 18 in my dance school we even have adult classes|`|M0vYaDEFaa	You are definitely not too old to dance! All you need to do is focus on technical stuff. For example, you say you want to take hip hop right? Well learn simple things such as isolations (moving one body part at a time) and popping and locking. Once you have the basics perfected it's really easy. Hip hop is one of those dances that is not a technical as others, such as ballet where there is a million different moves. Good luck!|`|9ac7f6c1bf93d03c18e4ababdea89f4caa	You are not too old to dance, but you will need to be patient with yourself for a while. The basis of all dance is ballet and this is the class that will give you the best foundation for other dance forms. It's also probably the most difficult, but if you're determined enough and a good studier of movement, you should be able to pick it up and develop proper placement.  Many schools offer teen or adult classes for beginners or dancers that have been away for a while. This is a great place to start and get a good idea. Hip hop will feel great after ballet, because you can loosen up and get your groove on! Above all, don't be intimidated by the other dancers. Remember that you are coming back after quite some time off, and you will not be as good as them yet, but you can also learn from them and try to copy their movement which will help you eventually develop your own style.    Good luck and get dancing!|`|BZohbG67aa	just feel good,no one will dare to point out u.      just go with the line             "criticism is the first step towards success"  so when u r ready everything will go fine.      mein choti thi tabhi karti thi,aaj badi ho gae tabhi karte hoon b'coz "dance make ne feel happy".  aata ho ya nahi ,aur sab sae badi baat hai mein to tumhare tarah aaj tak ek bhi class nahi kiya and still there r many who says i m the best dancer.  so go for urself.just go remember that there is someone who is waiting to see u as a star.      take care

The advantage that an up comming choreographer has over a well established choreographer is not having to feel the pressure of creating works to satisfy their benefactor's, a good example would be the need by most ballet companies to produce a perenial "Nutcraker Ballet" every season.    Look for the "templates" or process of discovering your creation of an "original idea" rather than technique.    For example "Shuchi "triggers Suchi, which triggers Fish, triggering Michael Phelps, triggering a water ballet set through speacial effects in a "large water bong".  That's an example of Process driven creative thinking.      Yes take dance lessons, continue studying dance techniques that never ends, however; learn to develope the right side of your brain by creating your own original ideas.      Some day you may be able to turn to a note book and pull out your original material and find an original piece of work you may have well created years befor creating  your producdution of an original pearl.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Phe...

The idea that Jesus was not an avatar, and that south asian people have a monopoly on avatars is shortsighted.  Why do you assume no one knows, about what you have caught a glimpse of?   I do not deny the truth of some of what you say, in fact my name indicates more about me than my profile, for those who get it.  There is just a danger in saying, "I am right and you are wrong", especially if your command of the language keeps you from explaining why you are right.   For me, I find the truth about God, is to be found more in experience than in books. What is your experience? The books are just road-maps and recipes for experiences.  What can you say to convince me there is something more I need to know? I say; I am that which happens of itself, in this moment, and I do love, since there is no other choice, because I see who I am, since I know I am not my perceptions.
ceBTTCPwaa	In late 1809, while mourning the death of his seventeen year old fiance Matilda Hoffman, Irving completed work on his first major book, A History of New-York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty, by Diedrich Knickerbocker (1809), a satire on self-important local history and contemporary politics. Prior to its publication, Irving started a hoax akin to today's viral marketing campaigns; he placed a series of missing person adverts in New York newspapers seeking information on Diedrich Knickerbocker, a crusty Dutch historian who had allegedly gone missing from his hotel in New York City. As part of the ruse, Irving placed a noticeallegedly from the hotel's proprietorinforming readers that if Mr. Knickerbocker failed to return to the hotel to pay his bill, he would publish a manuscript Knickerbocker had left behind.  Unsuspecting readers followed the story of Knickerbocker and his manuscript with interest, and some New York city officials were concerned enough about the missing historian that they considered offering a reward for his safe return. Riding the wave of public interest he had created with his hoax, Irvingadopting the pseudonym of his Dutch historianpublished A History of New York on December 6, 1809, to immediate critical and popular success.[ "It took with the public", Irving remarked, "and gave me celebrity, as an original work was something remarkable and uncommon in America". Today, the surname of Diedrich Knickerbocker, the fictional narrator of this and other Irving works, has become a nickname for Manhattan residents in general.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diedrich_Kn...
TbTO5SXlaa	I suggest enrolling in a photography class. If you take the time to learn about light and composition and shutter speeds and ISO and f-stops then you'll have a better idea of what camera to buy. You will also learn that there really isn't any "perfect camera" for you or anyone.     If classes aren't possible right now, buy a Pentax K1000 with a 50mm f1.7 lens and the Owner's Manual for the camera. Buy a copy of  "Object & Image: An Introduction to Photography, Third Edition" by George M. Craven. This will get you started.    Good luck.|`|D9x1QSgiaa	There is nothing "in between" digital and film. It's one or the other....like choosing between chicken or beef, Ford or Chevy, Coke or Pepsi.    I suggest you enroll in a Photography 101 class FIRST to learn the pros and cons of each kind of camera, the cost and the technical qualities of different models. Try shooting photos with several types of cameras...i.e Nikon (film vs digital) and Canon (film vs. digital).    For most beginners to intermediates I suggest the Canon EOS Rebel model XSi. (Also known as the Canon 450D) The "kit" package comes with an 18-55mm zoom lens. The camera has pop-up flash, 12.2 Megapixels, and shutter speeds up to 1/4000th, 7 autoexposure modes, Shutter Priority, Aperature Priority and Programmed Modes. It also has a 3 inch LCD screen and numerous other great features found only on more expensive cameras. Wal-Mart is also selling them now for about $799. Sam's Club also has them for $729.    I bought one of these 6 months ago and use it as my "back up" camera to a more expensive Canon EOS 5D Mark II. I absolutely love it. I have gotten some fantastic photos with it and cannot praise it enough. I routinely enlarge my photos to make 8x10's and 11x14 size enlargements with absolutely no noticeable distortion of loss of detail in the pictures.     If you prefer to use Nikon equipment I strongly recommend the Nikon D-90 which has similiar qualities and features as the Canon Rebel XSi. The D-90 sells for around $1,000. and has 12.3 MP quality with and max ISO sensitivity of 3,200.    Good Luck|`|HyDtiSa8aa	There is nothing between a digital camera and a film camera.  I suggest that you get a digital camera, 6-10 megapixel, as a starter and shoot, shoot, shoot.  The instant feedback with a digital camera is worth more than you could possibly gain from a film camera at this time.  Film is expensive, processing is expensive.   Get the biggest capacity memory cards you can afford (they are really cheap compared to film) and use the highest quality camera setting in the jpeg format.  I [sudjest], oh suggest, you get out the [Kadak] Kodak to see what you have and start with it.    Download GIMP which is free image editing program.

About the play itself or the pop culture it has created?  I can tell you there is a town called Verona in Italy. The movie was shot there. And there is a statue of Juliet there and an entire museum dedicated to the two tragic heroes.  I can also tell you they were not the first famous lovers in literature. There were many famous couples before them, like Penelope and Ulysses. They say the play was inspire by many famous love stories. As you know, Romeo and Juliet have inspired countless books, movies and even songs such as Don't Fear the Reaper, which was redone by HIM and Join Me In Death by HIM...  What else can I say? I mean some poeple wouldn't even know who Shakespeare was if it weren't for R&J!
zviDShi6aa	I think the writing style was snappy and cute. It was written and created by some of the writers from Sex and the City, so they definitely know how to say things that make people pay attention.    I know tons of people (men and women, actually) who really enjoyed it.  If you dig self-help, it definitely fits the bill. They said they found it reassuring, and said things in a way they hadn't thought of before. Getting out of your own head for a while ALWAYS helps in the situation you're in.    My personal recommendation would be to try to get it at a used bookstore, online or from the library--but that might be hard given that the movie's coming out. I found it to be a lot of common sense said in a newer, snappier manner. But that's what I think of most self-help. But if it helps you, there's nothing wrong with that. Sometimes we all need a little pick-me-up.    Sorry about your boyfriend. I've been there... I hope it helps! I think it might. :)    to the person who said just watch the movie:  The book is set up in scenarios, where they analyse different situations that happen to a lot of women based on the experience of one woman--usually a friend of theirs.It doesn't have characters or a storyline.  I don't know that the movie is going to really be like it since there wasn't a real plot in the book. It'll probably be like Mean Girls, where it was BASED on some stuff said in Queen Bees and Wannabes, but not central to the plot and nothing like reading the book.

AA10736802	In answering your question, Im assuming that for Germany you really mean West Germany.  After WW2, Germany was split between West (the Federal Republic, aligned with the free world) and East (the Democratic Republic, aligned with the Communist Bloc).  West Germany did indeed rise spectacularly  following WW2.  East Germany did not.      With that proviso, here are some factors in common between West Germany, Japan and South Korea that contributed to their rise: -    [1] All three countries were aligned with the US and its western allies, in terms of foreign policies, trade and economy.    [2] All three countries were  at least nominally  democracies, with governments elected fairly and laws to protect human rights.  I say nominally because although West Germany and Japan were true, functioning democracies, South Korea was for many years a sham democracy, with rigged elections, corrupt governments, and massive repression of those who disagreed with its government.    [3] All three countries received massive financial aid, especially from the US, to rebuild industry and society after WW2.    [4] All three countries were vigorously defended against actual or potential Communist aggression by the US and its allies.    [5] In all three countries, the population responded positively to the opportunities for economic growth and trade within the free world, working hard and intelligently to rebuild and modernize their countries.|`|9H8TW9f2aa	cheap imitations of excess capitalism.

Love is the sincere wish for others to be happy, and to be free from suffering.  Having realistically recognized others' kindness as well as their faults, love is always focused on the other persons welfare. We have No ulterior motives to fulfill our self-interest, or to fulfill our desires; to love others simply because they exist.  Selfish attachments, on the other hand, exaggerates others' good qualities and makes us crave to be with them. When we're with them, we're happy, but when we're separated from them, we are often miserable. These selfish attachments are linked with expectations of what others should be or do.  Is love as it is usually understood in most societies really love? or selfish attachments ?   Let us examine this a bit more. Generally we are attracted to people either because they have qualities we value or because they help us in some way. If we observe our own thought processes mindfully, and carefully - we'll notice that we look for specific qualities in others.   Some of these qualities we find attractive, others are those our parents, or society value.  We examine someone's looks, education,  financial situation, social status. This is how most of us decide on whether or not the person holds any true value to us.   In addition, we judge people as worthwhile according to how they relate to us! If they help us, praise us, make us feel secure, listen to what we have to say, care for us when we are sick or depressed, we consider them good people, and it is this type of people we are most likely to be more attracted to.     But this is very biased, for we judge them only in terms of how they relate to "us", as if we are the most important person in the world.  After we've judged certain people to be good for us, whenever we see them it appears to us as if goodness is coming from them, but if we are more aware, we recognize that we have projected this goodness onto them.    Desiring to be with the people a lot who make us feel good, we become emotional yo-yo's - when we're with these people, we're up, when we're not with these people, we're down.    Furthermore, we form fixed concepts of what our relationships with those people will be and thus have expectations of them. When they do not live up to our expectations of them, we're very disappointed, or may become angry.  We want them to change so that they will they will match what we think they are. But our projections and expectations come from our own minds, not from the other people.  Our problems arise not because others aren't who we thought they we're, but because we mistakenly thought they were something they aren't.  Checklist: "I Love You if __________ "  What we call love is most often selfish attachments.  It is actually a disturbing attitude that overestimates the qualities of another person. We then cling to tightly to that person, thinking our happiness depends on that person.  " Unconditional Love, on the other hand, is an open and very calm, relaxed attitude. We want someone to be happy, and free from suffering simply because they exist. While selfish attachments are uncontrolling and too sentimental, Unconditional Love is direct and powerful. Selfish attachments obscures our judgment and we become impatient, angry, and impartial, helping only our dear ones and harming those who we don't like. Unconditional Love builds up others, and clarifies our minds, and we   access a situation by thinking of the greatest good for everyone. Attachments are based on selfishness, while Love is founded upon cherishing others, even those who do not look very appealing to the eyes. Unconditional Love looks beyond all the superficial appearances, and dwells on the fact that they are just like us: they want inner peace, happiness, and want to avoid suffering. If we see unattractive, dirty, ignorant people, we feel repulsed because our selfish minds want to know attractive, intellectual, clean, and talented people. Unconditional Love, on the other hand, never evaluates others by these superficial standards and looks much deeper into the person. Unconditional Love recognizes that regardless of the others' appearances, their experience is the same as ours: they seek inner peace, to be happy, to be free from sufferings, and to do their best to avoid problems.   When we're selfishly attached, we're not mentally and emotionally free. We overly depend on and cling to another person to fulfill our mental and especially our emotional needs. We fear losing the person, feeling we'd be incomplete without him.     However, this does not mean that we should suppress our emotional needs or become aloof, alone and totally independent, for that too does not solve the problem. We must simply realize our unrealistic needs, and slowly seek to eliminate them. Some emotional needs may be so strong that they can't be dissolved immediately.  If we try to suppress them or pretend they do not exist, we become anxious, insecure, falling into a depression. In this case, we can do our best to fulfill our needs while simultaneously working gradually to subdue them.  "The core problem is that most of us seek to be loved, rather than to love. We yearn to be understood by others rather than to understand them. In all honesty, our sense of emotional insecurities comes from the selfishness obscuring our own minds. 'We can develop self-confidence by recognizing our inner potential to become a selfless human being with many, magnificent qualities, then we'll develop a true and accurate feeling of self-confidence. And   then we'll seek to increase true unconditional love, without selfish att|`|Pny8KDVdaa	A gift granted by god in order to learn and then come home.|`|bd893d1292d7c953a63fcaa5983c8769aa	Life is you not asking what it is, because that is life .|`|d7c3ec424019a83ec87fc8fd47aa4b22aa	The constant barrage of question and the never ending urge to find the answers.

In most cases, they might be brooding on things some sand mostly on things which do not exist at all. Fantasy is closely connected to being lonely in the positive connotation, but in the negative connotation, it is depression, desperateness, lack of confidence or any such miseries.|`|AA11525727	A grown man with a teddy bear.

aIHSmRYwaa	Yes, definitly start flailing your arms around!|`|iLarL6BUaa	umm no. go but watch what other people r doing. then just kinda copy them. i think youll b fine then. hope i helped!|`|ianulrAJaa	I've studied Ballroom for a year, Slasa for four years, Swing for two years, and Tango for about six months.    First you should choose what type of dancing you like.  Ballroom classes are good to start because you get the best sense of all the different types of dancing that there are out there.    You should go check out dance clubs (Salsa, Latin, Swing, Tango, Hip Hop, etc.) and see what you like best.    Private classes are pricey, I don't recommend untill later.    I would go to BIG group classes, these are the cheapest AND you get to learn from many people and get many different dance partners.    DVD's are good only once you are an intermetiate or advaced dancer, they will of no use to you as a beginner, because it can't tell you what you are doing wrong.    There are many free public events that you can find online.    I would recommend joining Meetup.com and find a group with similar dancing interests.    College dance clubs (organizations) are great too.    My recommendation is that you start with a popular "social" dance style (one that you dance with a partner).  Salsa and Swing are the two most popular in the U.S. right now.  Tango is very popular internationally too.    Pick one and stick with it untill you have a handle of it.    Every genre has many different variations.  Salsa has ballroom, NY, LA, Casino, etc.  Swing has East coast, West coast, lindy Hop, etc.  Don't get confussed with too many dance styles.  Pick one, any which one, and stick with it untill you got it before you learn a different variation.

I think you'll get an A!!|`|174318d0a089a9048419f7fc7c038810aa	This is also called a diamond poem, The first line is a word, basicaly your subject, the second line is made up of two adjectives, or synonyms of the first word. The third line is made up of four words, two are adjectives of the first word, and the other two are adjectives of the exact opposite. The fourth line is also three adjectives of the opposite of the first word. The fifth line is made up of two words that are adjectives of the opposite of the first word, then finally the last line is made up of one word which is the opposite of the first word.    example:                                  Love                           Caring Affection                     Forbidden Abusive Great                Sharing Adoration Anger Violence                      Revulsion Dislike Disgust                          Loathing Antipathy                                 Hate    It's even shaped like a diamond ,see ?.
7U0sPJ2saa	1) Awesome. I really like the contrast of the bright red flower with the worn wood.  2) Also awesome. Again with the aged wood. Seriously, where did you find this fence?  3) The light is too bright in contrast with the sprig ya got there.  4) Pretty cool, but there's something about the lighting that I don't like. I don't know if the flower is too dark for the lighting in the background or if I don't like the shadow...  Regardless, I really like this vivid flower against the low-key, natural coloring. I think I would have put the flower in focus rather than the background.  5) Boring.  6)The wings on the butterfly are too washed out with light. There's all of this intense texture for the bark and the wings are like a slap in the face with a flaccid penis. The intensity is gone because you can't see the details of what looks like some pretty cool coloring.|`|iL1tYfJMaa	MY thoughts?? That you need to keep practicing. I am SHOCKED that someone commented on the great details !!!!    These photos are very poorly focused and contain virtually NO details !!!!!

Wicked, Son Of A Witch, Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, Mirror Mirror, and Lost are spectacular.
WMJwIRGxaa	As government intevention/interference, through the New Deal, in the recovery grew, so did the unemployment.  The great industrial move, caused by our involvement in WWII, finally brought us out of the problems.  This was due to the fact that the only way for the economy to truly right itself was for government to recede, and private industry increase.    This same solution would work today.

GLS7vgAdaa	The key to any step you're trying to master is you need to go back to the basics. While doing plies at the barre concentrate on how doing these simple but essential exercises translates into doing better turns or leaps. Make sure you focus on your balances after every barre exercise and do them without holding on while positioning your leg and/or arms in each one you do. Start your first balance with your foot couped front and back, then in retire front and back, then in a front attitude, and in back attitude. for the grande pirouettes, plie with your outside leg in coupe and rise into releve as your outside leg goes into second. HOLD, HOLD, HOLD it making sure your hips are level and your technique is right and repeat as needed. If you attain these positions at the barre or center floor, have the confidence that it's in your muscle memory...which is crucial for all dancers to be aware of. you should then see a difference in your actual leaps and turns. Best of luck!|`|n8eRg88Faa	well I recommend before going and warming up, to do maybe 100 sit ups. this will help you find your center of balance which will help with all of those moves. other than that, constantly running and keeping your legs in really good shape for those jumps:)   well, that's really all I can help you with if your not struggling with them:) good luck with your audition:)|`|8pDblyCBaa	just do some stripping excesses.
d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Yes; between Wittgenstein and Derrida, the focus is almost entirely on language. The presumption is that thought requires language, which we have clear empirical evidence against.|`|1243f4e8337cd349f01721fab2d47a02aa	If by analytic you mean anglo-american philosophy,  I would answer: not today. For instance, analytical epistemology, philosophy of mind and metaphysics ask the same questions that concerned Aristotle, Descartes or Hume. Philosophy of science asks genuinly interesting questions (demarcation between ordinary knowledge, science and philosophy; relation between confirmation and theories).  I would say continental philosophy may be the one obssesed with language.     If by analytical you mean ordinary language philosophy, which is no longe rmainstream, I would say that probably yes....

The social welfare state build in many west European nations was nothing but continuing and improving on what Hitler created.   He gave people work. Better employment laws. Health care (Hitler himself was vegetarian and the first active non smoker.) A pension, upon retirement. Social laws in case they got ill. A social organization for the workers (Kraft durch Freude), with holiday resorts, a cruiseship and plans to give the people an affordable car: the KdF wagen, which later became the Volkswagen Beetle.     I'm not in favor of Hitler singing his praise; this is what he did. People did pay a very heavy price for it, but that was at that time in the future.

But you don't make your story any better just by piling on horrible things happening. You need a plot. You need to make us care about your character by making her a person we'd like to meet. You need to think about what would actually happen in the situations you are writing about, not about what's most tragic - why would she not be allowed to see her dying friend?     You also really need to proofread. Many of your sentences are four or five sentences rammed together, and there are loads which make no sense because words are missing. This is a first draft.

JS9v8ZEzaa	If you want to know what happens in them, then here.       Eclipse-The story begins with the revelation that Seattle is being plagued by a string of unsolved murders, which Edward suspects are being caused by a newborn vampire that is unable to control its thirst. Edward and Bella fill out college applications, while Bella explains to Edward her desire to see Jacob, her werewolf friend, again. Meanwhile, Alice Cullen has a vision that Victoria, a vampire who is hunting Bella, is back in town. Although Edward fears for her safety, Bella insists that Jacob and the rest of the werewolf pack would never harm her, and he eventually allows her to visit Jacob once in a while. A few days later Edward proposes to Bella and, despite having an aversion to marriage, she accepts.Bella and the Cullens realize that the murders in Seattle are being committed by an "army" of newborn vampires, controlled by Victoria. The Cullen family joins forces with the werewolf pack in order to combat this threat. As everyone else prepares for battle, Edward and Bella camp up in the mountains, hidden during the battle, where they are later joined by Jacob and Seth Clearwater, a young member of the werewolf pack, to wait out the fight.  In the morning, Jacob overhears Edward and Bella discussing their engagement and becomes very upset. He threatens to join the fight and get himself killed because Bella doesn't love him. To stop him, Bella kisses Jacob and realizes that she loves him, too. Victoria tracks Edward's scent to Bella and Edward is forced to fight, despite Bella's wishes to keep him safely with her. After Victoria and her army are successfully destroyed, Bella explains to Jacob that while she loves him, her love for Edward is greater and she cannot live without him. After receiving a wedding invitation from a humble Edward, Jacob runs away in his wolf form to escape the pain he feels, angry at Bella's decision to become a vampire.       Breaking Dawn-Breaking Dawn is split into three separate "books", or parts. The first part details Bella's marriage and honeymoon with Edward, which they spend on a private island off the coast of Brazil. Edward grants Bella's wish and makes love to her. Soon after, Bella notices her period is late and realizes that she is pregnant. After contacting Carlisle, who confirms her belief, she and Edward plan to return home. Edward, concerned for her well being as the fetus develops with unnatural rapidity, urges her to get an abortion. However, Bella wants to keep the child and decides to contact Rosalie for support, knowing that Rosalie has always wanted children.The second part of the novel is written from Jacob Black's point of view, and lasts throughout Bella's pregnancy and childbirth. The pack of werewolves, not knowing what danger the unborn child may pose, make plans to destroy it, even though they must kill Bella to do so. Jacob vehemently disagrees with this decision and revolts, leaving the pack to form his own with Seth and Leah Clearwater. Bella soon gives birth, approximately a month after becoming pregnant. The baby breaks many of her bones, and Bella loses massive amounts of blood. In order to save her life, Edward changes her into a vampire. Jacob, who was present for the birth, immediately "imprints"  an involuntary response in which a werewolf finds his soul mate  on Edward and Bella's newborn daughter, Renesmee. The third section of Breaking Dawn shifts back to Bella's perspective, finding her changed into a vampire and enjoying her new life and abilities. However, the vampire Irina misidentifies Renesmee as an "immortal child", a child who has been turned into a vampire. The creation and protection of "immortal children" was previously outlawed by the Volturi. After Irina presents her allegation to the Volturi, they plan to destroy Renesmee and the Cullens. In an attempt to save her, the Cullens gather vampires from around the world to stand as witnesses and prove to the Volturi that Renesmee is not an immortal child. Upon confronting the gathered Cullen allies and witnesses, the Volturi discover that they have been misinformed and immediately execute Irina for her mistake. However, they remain undecided on whether Renesmee should be viewed as a threat to the secret existence of vampires. At that time, Alice and Jasper, who had left prior to the confrontation, return with Nahuel, a 150-year-old vampire-human crossbreed like Renesmee. He demonstrates that the crossbreeds pose no threat and the Volturi leave, knowing that they no longer have just reason to destroy Renesmee. Bella, Edward and Renesmee return to their home, free to live their lives in peace.|`|CeKNuNliaa	So explain why you can't read the books again? Are you illeterate or something?

Meanwhile, Bella is forced to choose between her relationship with Edward and her friendship with Jacob. Edward's family of vampires and Jacob's pack of werewolves join forces to successfully destroy Victoria and her army of vampires. In the end, Bella chooses Edward's love over Jacob's and agrees to marry him.    Breaking Dawn    Bella and Edward get married, but their honeymoon is cut short by Bella's realization that she has become pregnant. Bella's pregnancy progresses extremely quickly and makes her very weak. She nearly dies while giving birth to her and Edward's half-vampire-half-human daughter, Renesmee, but Edward injects Bella with his venom to save her life by turning her into a vampire. A vampire from another coven sees Renesmee and mistakes her for an "immortal child", the existence of which violates vampire rules, and informs the Volturi. The Cullens gather vampire witnesses who can verify that the child is not one of the immortal children. The Cullens and their witnesses convince the Volturi that Renesmee is not a danger to vampires or their secret, and they are left in peace.|`|RKC36n9Naa	do you really want to know the whole plot?why? it ruins the story. i suggest you just read the summary on the cover.|`|FAXR5lwhaa	eclispe- victoria has an army of newborn vampires and the cullens and werewolves have a battle against the newborn vampires. bella loves jacob too. edward proposes    breaking dawn- bella is married. bella is preganant. baby is half vampire and human and jacob imprints on it. bella turns into a vampire. there is trouble when a vampire thought the child was a newborn vampire
8yE2sYGeaa	But here's the problem: we don;t know if he is happy or sad    I took the one less traveled by,  And that has made all the difference.    Did it make a postive difference or a negative one? Was he unhappy with his choice and now he looks back on this with regret?|`|kU5Mbn3oaa	no the words dont have to be the actual meaning but the poem is pretty simple and has a lot of symbolism     here many this will helpInterpretation    The poem has two recognized interpretations. One is a more literal interpretation, while the other is more ironic.  Readers often see the poem literally, as an expression of individualism. Critics typically view the poem as ironic.[1]  "'The Road Not Taken,' perhaps the most famous example of Frost's own claims to conscious irony and 'the best example in all of American poetry of a wolf in sheep's clothing.'"[2]  and Frost himself warned "You have to be careful of that one; it's a tricky poem  very tricky."[3]  "Frost intended the poem as a gentle jab at his great friend and fellow poet who was also best friends with Edward Thomas, and seemed amused at this certain interpretation of the poem as inspirational." Frost was making a joke when making this poem about a friend he travelled with on the path one day. He faced a huge dilemmia on what path to take even though they were both the same. "Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,And both that morning equally lay"(lines 9-11) the paths being the same is proven in this quote from the poem. [4]  [edit]Literal interpretation  According to the literal interpretation, the poem is inspirational, a paean to individualism and non-conformism.  The poem's last lines, where the narrator declares that taking the road "less traveled by" has "made all the difference," can be seen as a declaration of the importance of independence and personal freedom. "The Road Not Taken" seems to illustrate that once one takes a certain road, there is no turning back. Although one might change paths later on, the past cannot be changed. It can be seen as showing that choice is very important, and is a thing to be considered.  This interpretation is connected with misremembering the title as "The Road Less Traveled", since it places emphasis on the choice made, not the opportunities foregone.  [edit]Ironic interpretation  The ironic interpretation, widely held by critics,[1][5] is that the poem is instead about regret and personal myth-making, rationalizing our decisions.  In this interpretation, the final two lines:  I took the one less traveled by,  And that has made all the difference.  are ironic  the choice made little or no difference at all, the speaker's protestations to the contrary. The narrator admits in the second and third stanzas that both paths may be equally worn and equally leaf-covered, and it is only in his future recollection that he will call one road "less traveled by".  The sigh, widely interpreted as a sigh of regret, might also be interpreted ironically: in a 1925 letter to Crystine Yates of Dickson, Tennessee, asking about the sigh, Frost replied: "It was my rather private jest at the expense of those who might think I would yet live to be sorry for the way I had taken in life."[6]    i had to memorize this poem in 7th grade and i still remember it 6 years later once you get it you will understand|`|9TLsWjV5aa	I looked up modernist poetry, and found out that it has little to do with the structure of the poem, but when it was written. The Road Not Taken just so happens to have been written right in the middle of time of modernist poetry.

f4Nn0W1xaa	People have had the same characteristics since the dawn of time. It is the extent to which certain segments are allowed to acceptably express those characteristics which has been the variable. Even so, there have always been people, both male and female, who have acted outside the frame of  conformity to prevailing social norms. I doubt that it would be accurate to call Cervantes a feminist, but it would certainly be appropriate to call him an observer, a philosopher, and a student of humanity.

Modern technology and examination of the film proves that the  two lethal shots came from the Schoolbook Depository and what effect they had. It proves the "super-bullet"(second shot) theory and the the third shot which hit Kennedy in the head, behind his right ear.    Oswald used an Italian Mannlicher-Carcano bolt action rifle, firing 6.5 millimeter bullets. Oswald fired three times, the first shot missing the car entirely.    Vincent Bulgliosi's epic book "Reclaiming History" will answer every question you may have about the Kennedy assassination. Today, there is no doubt that Oswald shot Kennedy, and acted alone.|`|xQwU590Laa	There were a few others, but they either did not show Kennedy, or had a bad angle, or were too blurry. Only the Zapruder film has a decent view.    The fuss is- and was- that the government said Kennedy was shot from behind, but the movie looks like he was shot from in front.  Kennedy's head snaps back as the fatal shot hits him.  He did not lose his head, just a fist size hole in the side.    Interestingly, the autopsy photos and x-rays do not match up as to where the wound was.    The investigation was so bungled that we will never know what happened exactly.|`|qDSvOOwBaa	Without getting into a long discussion the National Archives has 9 different films taken before during and after the assassination. There are also 151 still photos(of the assassination scene) in the Archive along with 1,870.421 documents for(restricted) public view-not just anyone can go.    s_e_s    In  2027 and additional 3 motion pictures and 408 still pictures will be released along with 448.909 additional documents.|`|9pC2u5ZWaa	A more conspiratorial answer may be ...

077713ee95aa711e6d344800dfbfe5acaa	Caro amigo vc vai TER que come?ar com uma reflex, que s?o cameras mais robustas, maiores, e tm como principal caracterstica possurem um espelho interno e retrtil no qual a luz, que entra pela objetiva, reflete e muda de dira??o at atingir o sensor digital ou o filme. S?o as preferidas dos profissionais. Outra grande caracterstica  permitir a troca de objetivas (e isso  fundamental para muitos fotgrafos). Alm disso, a maioria delas possui sensores de melhor qualidade, que podem chegar a 16 megapixels em alguns modelos e maiores velocidades para o obturador, alm de possurem excelentes recursos n?o encontrados nas compactas.    O problema s?o as lentes    Como de costume, n?o custa lembrar que estamos falando de uma espcie de camera bem diferente das compactas a que a maioria dos amadores est acostumada  a come?ar pela necessidade da compra de lentes, que podem facilmente custar mais que o corpo da camera e dar um belo trabalho para escolher. A que vem no kit, quando vem, dificilmente satisfaz um fotgrafo (mesmo amador) exigente.    Dizem que uma 18-55 da Nikon  bem melhor que a da Canon, mas alm de nenhuma das duas ser um primor tico, basta dividir 55 por 18 para ver que o zoom das bichinhas  de meros 3X. Para quem pretende fazer o upgrade de uma amadora avan?ada com zoom de mais de 10X, isso representar um retrocesso e tanto. A n?o ser que se invistam pelo menos outros US$ 300 numa tele mais possante ou vrias vezes isso, em lentes profissionais.    Agora a quest?o pre?o  meio complexa, vai depender da marca, da mdia de armazenamento, da fonte de energia.... Vc vai encontrar corpos de R$2.500 a R$7.000, pre?os aqui no Brasil, fora o investimento em lentes....

5a4301ce938f859dd437d12da9ecbf77aa	please see the source.      The Summing Up by W. Somerset Maugham    British novelist, playwright, short-story writer, highest paid author in the world in the 1930s. Despite his popularity, Maugham did not gain serious recognition. This was expressed in his autobiography THE SUMMING UP (1938), that he stood 'in the very first row of the second-raters'. Maugham's skill in handling plot has been compared by critics in the manner of Guy de Maupassant. In many novels the surroundings are international and the stories are told in clear, economical style with cynical or resigned undertone.
knuRLiHVaa	I loved this story. Funnily enough, I polled people I knew who read it, and it was the adults who were most disturbed by it.  I know it disturbed me, but it was supposed to. Wonderful writing.|`|UdIF6Ug2aa	I LOVED Coraline. In fact, I just answered a question from another guy, recommending that he check out Neil Gaiman's stories haha. Coraline was bought as a birthday present for my younger cousin, but I snuck it out and read it, and it was a terrific book.    Truly spooky, with a strong, smart, curious protagonist (who's a child!), it's really quite a good example of a bite-sized good read. Oh, I liked the Cat, too. You have a cool school, to be reading Coraline.    In case you were interested, they're making an animated film based on Coraline, to be released around Christmas '08.    If you like Coraline, you might like to check out Gaiman's graphic novels "The Day I Swapped My Dad For Two Goldfish" and "Wolves in The Walls".
OgKUsf4naa	I can only really speak to Utilitarianism and Kant.      Utilitarianism's big benefit is that it will always support the majority, therefore pleasing the greatest number of people.  Its downfall is the constant denial of minorities.      If by reasoning theory you mean categorical imperative, then I suppose its advantage is that any action that causes harm to anyone is never ethical under any circumstances.  Of course that is rather unrealistic: there's no guarantee anyone else will operate under that assumption.|`|7XI35YbTaa	Advantages and Disadvantages in relation to what?  For one to speak of Advantage or Disadvantage, one needs to have some sort of preferred outcome or goal in mind.   Without making a prior indication of said preferred outcome, your question is rendered meaningless.     And Jeremy Bentham's remains are a little dusty. I'd know since I was witness to them for about 4 years during the course of my degree.      If you want my opinion on the above...  .... The egoist approach is fine, but it presupposes to know what any given individual should want. I am an egotistical individual, but my desires are unconventional... and often people don't know the entirety of what they desire relative to what their body desires.  .... Bentham's Utilitarianism is awesome, socially speaking. It is difficult to implement though as people aren't entirely adapted to merely be drones in the hive yet. People suffer from a constant dissonance between their individual needs and social needs. Utilitarianism treats people like numbers... and serves only the social needs.   .... Prima Facie? Never heard of it.  .... Divine Command?  Sounds like it involves gods / god. Forget it. I will not be commanded but by myself.  .... And Kant was barking up the wrong tree. The guy was a douchebag. I'm not sure I can say much more on the matter than that. All I can really ascertain is that he looked at things and came to the wrong conclusions. Reboot and start again.
5u66iIejaa	A Falecida revolucionou o teatro brasileiro da poca ao abordar uma temtica extremamente carioca. Foi a primeira de muitas pe?as onde Nelson Rodrigues colocou suburbanos frustrados e fracassados como protagonistas.

O sucesso comercial foi muito grande e essas foram as pe?as mais assistidas de Nelson.    Para retratar fielmente o suburbano e sofrido carioca, o autor troca a poesia e as metforas pela linguagem coloquial. As personagens conversam sobre temas triviais, comentam assuntos populares e usam muitas grias. O autor foi muito feliz na escolha delas, j que a grande maioria transfere o leitor contemporaneo diretamente para a dcada de 50. Com faro para descartar modismos, Nelson Rodrigues usou em A Falecida express?es como a polcia n?o  sopa, pintar o sete, pernas de pau, descascando a lenha, cabe?a inchada,  batata!, etc. Tem espa?o at mesmo para as abrevia??es da linguagem falada, como t logo!, e estrangeirismos, como all right e bye, bye.|`|33b521429a09738866d417d64324ce39aa	Os sete gatinhos.

g8kIjpwSaa	Skew should be available to you on a smart object. Hit apple + T for the transform box, right click on the object and click skew from the menu.    Sorry, distort is not available. The reason only a few options work (scale, skew, etc.) is because while you are distorting them in a way, it's a symmetrical distort. It's a long, boring explanation about path curve algorithms, so I'll spare you. Either way, skew should work.

DenLZAL1aa	Augustus Jackson was the inventor of modern ice cream manufacture. Born on April 16, 1808, he is sometimes noted as "The Father of Ice Cream". Augustus was a candy confectioner from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the U.S. who created several ice cream recipes and invented an improved method of manufacturing ice cream. Augustus Jackson was the head chef in the White House from roughly 1820-30,[citation needed]. During this time he developed several new flavors of ice cream, around the year 1832.[citation needed] Later he resigned, returning to Philadelphia to improve ice cream and his new flavors, becoming very well-known for his famous ice cream.    African American, Augustus Jackson was a candy confectioner from Philadelphia who created several ice cream recipes and invented an improved method of manufacturing ice cream around 1832.   The origins of ice cream can be traced back to the 4th century B.C. and contrary to popular folklore Augustus Jackson did not invent ice cream itself, however, he was an accomplished businessman and helped to perfect the making of ice cream at that time.    Augustus Jackson left his position as a White House chef to move to Philadelphia in the late 1820s, where he started his own successful catering business. Jackson created several popular ice cream flavors which he distributed packaged in tin cans to the ice cream parlors of Philadelphia. At that time, many African Americans owned ice cream parlors or were ice cream makers in the Philadelphia area. Augustus Jackson was the most successful and his ice cream flavors were well loved.   Augustus Jackson did not apply for any patents.

The building of a transcontinental rail network stimulated the growth of a huge unified national market for American manufactured goods      O  3. Corrupt financial dealings and political manipulations by the railroads created a public demand for railroad regulation, such as the Interstate Commerce Act     R  4. New technological developments in steel making, oil refining, and communication laid the basis for huge new industries and spectacular economic growth    K  5. The ruthless competitive techniques of Rockefeller and  other industries eliminated competition and created monopolistic trusts in many industries    P  6. The growing concentration of wealth and power in the new corporate plutocracy often made laborers feel powerless and vulnerable to their well-off corporate employers    J  7.

AA11111233	That's the way to think.  I am so damn sick of TWILIGHT.    Sit down and make two lists.  In one list, write down some things that fascinate you, whether it be police affairs, supernatural powers, or the feminist movement.  Next, write down a list of things going on in the world or societal issues that concern you the most.  See if this can drum up any ideas for a new novel.  Write down your innermost thoughts in a journal.  What can you draw from it.    Another idea I have is to turn your TV off, stare at the blank screen and pretend you are watching your novel on TV.  This is a good idea for the thinking process.  However, I'm afraid you might "watch" teen angst and romance, which may turn you off.  Good luck.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	ok|`|SBhVZD4Xaa	write a different genre. steer clear of vampires, romance, and wizards|`|KQjBLyU3aa	Stop thinking like a teenager- problem solved.|`|fc4baf02ff9f98a7a775f05738a7b5c2aa	think of twilight.....    now write the COMPLETE opposite and you're good to go!    Oh and NO vampires lol|`|vDH7CzZYaa	i am trying to do the same and i agree with the person before me, (if it is still that person) stop thinking like a teenager. think more like an adult reliving their past. envision how you want your story to go and think about all the details. if you write something like "the moment was perfect and i didn't want to let go of it or him/her" (depends on the perspective) its okay but honestly that line has been in so many novella's its annoying. try closing your eyes and looking at everything your main character(s) is seeing and make sure to do that with other, maybe not as important characters like the people talking to or are around the main character to make everything flow much MUCH better.|`|SYKGIiQkaa	Just do it, think of something out-of-the box.

That's the spirit! *coughs* Twilight *coughs*  Focus on real life.  I know that sounds cheesy, but if you twist real life and make it a little better, you'll end up with some pretty cool stuff.

I'll take teen angst right now. Significantly less complicated.|`|rSbsj3tgaa	Steer clear of whiny protagonists. Catch your character b*tching and edit it out.

LuthienT|`|Xc02z608aa	Start by writing in a genre other than romance.  Every truly good story has some romance in it anyway, so you'll not be completely without it.  Think of a genre you are interested in and develop a main story that does not include romance then add the romance in as a sub plot.
AA10725882	The Egyptians - assuming you mean the Greek War for Independence 1821-1832.    From http://www.mlahanas.de/Greece/History/Gr...  "Fighting between Greeks and Ottomans begun in 1821 continued until 1825, when the Sultan asked for help from his most powerful vassal, Egypt.  Egypt was then ruled by Mehemet Ali Pasha who was eager to test his newly modernized armed forces. The Ottoman Sultan also promised Ali concessions in Syria if Egypt participated. The Egyptian force, under the command of Ali's son Ibrahim, was successful and quickly gained dominance of the seas and Aegean islands through the navy.  In Europe the Greek revolt aroused widespread sympathy. Greece was viewed as the cradle of western civilization, and it was especially lauded by the spirit of romanticism that was current at the time. The sight of a Christian nation attempting to cast off the rule of a Muslim Empire also appealed to the western European public."

It just depends what country you were born in, and the norm for naming babies there.     In the UK, USA and most parts of Europe, it's standard for the baby to be given the father's surname. BUT at the end of the day, the name your parents gave you at birth woud be the name on your birth certificate. That name is your legal and official name.     I mention this next point because your parents' surnames seem to be of Spanish origin. Remember also that in some Latin countries they give both the mother's AND father's surnames to the child. For example, you may have been called Adrienna Mendez Chacon; meaning that legally, they're BOTH your surnames. My fiance has this naming structure, and he was born in Spain.

AA12016117	There were people who claimed to be Alexei.  I think the reason Anna Anderson was so famous was because of her publicity and strange story which she kept up for so long, and because if anyone had survived it was probably most likely to be she.

One such individual was Anna Anderson who got away with it for a long time until DNA tests proved she was not Anastasia.|`|GaHkxtU9aa	In July 1918, when the Romanovs were murdered, the Bolshevik government just said that the family had been executed - there were no details of when, where etc of the murders. In July 1918 the world was still fighting the first world war - too busy to pay real detail into the executions of the despised Romanovs.    But with the war ended in 1919 the world began to take an interest when a woman in 1919 was found to be attempting suicide in Berlin. When she came around after psychiatric care, she claimed to be Anastasia - the daughter of Tsar Nicholas II.    There were rumours and stories that some members escaped, that all members escaped. I remember reading that even in Russia that Soviet troops stopped trains looking for the alledged Alexei, who was rumoured also to have escaped.     But what got the whole world focused on Anastasia was the media attention, the stories - even a movie was made about Anastasia in the 1950's. Anna Anderson herself had told the media that the rest of the family had been murdered - including Alexei and that she had escaped with the help of a Russian soldier.    Anna Anderson attraced so much attention with her stories - which did get her admirers and even people who believed that she was the real Anastasia - everyone forgot about the rest of the family. With her death in the 1980's that she brought the true secrets with her to the grave.    As other's have stated - there were imposters who claimed to be Alexei - one guy in the 1950's was actually employed by the CIA.  Guy Richards wrote a book about it 'Hunt for the Tsar' - many of which he wrote we know to be absolute rubbish 30 years later.

AA12343309	Don't confuse nationality with race  ethnicity,  or ancestral heritage.    If you are an American citizen and you don't have dual citizenship, your nationality is 100% American and nothing but American.      Your ethnic background is largely Italian but those those born in the U.S. might have a different ethnicity.    If all of your ancestors eventually have roots in Italy, no matter whether they were born in the U.S. or not, then your ethnicity would be 100% Italian.    If you have friends that go around saying I am 1/2 Italian and 1/2 American, tell them they are wrong.  Since the U.S. is made up of people mostly from all over Europe and now from Eastern countries, American cannot be classified as an ethnicity and the countries from which their ancestors came are not their "nationalities."  America is only a nationality.  Italy is a nationality for people who are citizens of Italy but in America it is an ethnicity or ancestral heritage for people whose ancestors came from there.    I have ancestors that were in this country before the Mayflowers,at Jamestown Virginia the first permanent English settlement in the Americas and some that it is said crossed an ice bridge from East Asia many thousands of years ago.  Still your nationality is just as American as mine is.  But in my ancestral heritage I am a Pedigree American Mutt.|`|gmrH0sNBaa	I would say about 75%|`|RSEp960aaa	I believe you are 11/16ths Italian.    Your mother is italian, which makes you 1/2 from her (8/16)    Your father had a great grandfather who was Italian, so he would be 1/8 italian from that. He also had a grandfather who was italian, so he would get one quarter from that, adding up to 3/8s Italian. You would get half of that, so that's 3/16ths.  8/16+3/16=11/16th Italian|`|AA12029875	ok you are 1/2 of your mother who is 100% italian  so, from your mother you are 50% italian.            on your dad's side his mother was 50%italian he was 25%italian so from your father you are at least 12% italian   together   that makes you at least  621/2% italian  maybe more but in order to be more accurate you would need to know for sure where your other relatives came from.  and as you see being born in the u.s. doesn't make your mother any less of Italian descent.

162603d72ddcf3279ac7690bc9b8ba0daa	Nikon, Canon, Pentax, Olympus and Sony/(Minolta) all have entry level dSLR cameras with a kit lens.  Any one would be fine for a beginner.  Nikon and Canon have more available support and accessories, but in reality any system will serve the needs of 95% of people.    The better investment for a novice photographer would be in a class on beginning photography, time in reading and studying your camera manual, and a few basic books on photography, both technique and art.  "Understanding Exposure" or anything by Bryan Peterson is a good start.  Then study and practice will help you make good images as your knowledge and skill grow.  Best wishes, it is a fun hobby.|`|3mAgM405aa	If you are really on a budget and want the best quality for the money, check out the P&S Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 [with a Leica lense] which has more features than most pro DSLRs that require auxiliary lenses not even equal to the single initial full-range lense that comes with the FZ28. It is reviewed at:    http://www.steves-digicams.com/2008_revi...    It just came out on November 4, 2008.    It's an all-in-one 10.1 megapixel digital camera which includes (i) built-in image stabilization; (ii) HD720 quality video [Quicktime] which permits zooming while videoing; (iii) a 18x zoom [27 - 486 mm (35mm equiv.)] "Leica" lense for nature photography; (iv) up to 0.39 inch macro option; (v) up to 6400 ASA; (vi) takes up to 380 pictures per 120 min. battery charge; (vii) has a "burst speed" of 13 fps; and sells new for $320 at amazon.com.    Here's an actual handheld picture of the moon:    http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/...

You can't go wrong. One convenient feature that is exclusive to Nikon is that all Nikon manual lenses can be used with the digital bodies.  Over the past 8 to 10 years Canon has been embraced strongly by photo journalists and sports photographers. Only certain manual lenses will work on the digital bodies.  Both are quality systems but, in my opinion Nikon builds a sturdier camera.  If you want top shelf quality and you have the money, I would go with Leica.  As for which model, I would do some research, ask the folks at the camera stores and get something that you can grow into and expand on. You're better off spending a little more money on something that you won't have to replace just because you've out grown it's features.|`|ApYAtHMpaa	a entry level DSLR like    XT,XTI.XSI from canon    e420 from Olympus    Pentax k20    Nikon D40,D40x    all of them, will work with you, read carefully the manual, and start some classes or take a book and practice a lot!|`|D9x1QSgiaa	There are TWO primary factors to consider:   1. How much money do you have to spend????  2. What level of photography do you aspire to "progress to". (i.e. basic beginner, intermediate, or professional/business use).     For most beginners to intermediates I suggest the Canon EOS Rebel model XSi. (Also known as the Canon 450D) The "kit" package comes with an 18-55mm zoom lens. The camera has pop-up flash, 12.2 Megapixels, and shutter speeds up to 1/4000th, 7 autoexposure modes, Shutter Priority, Aperature Priority and Programmed Modes. It also has a 3 inch LCD screen and numerous other great features found only on more expensive cameras. Wal-Mart is also selling them now for about $799. Sam's Club also has them for $729.    I bought one of these 6 months ago and use it as my "back up" camera to a more expensive Canon EOS 5D Mark II. I absolutely love it. I have gotten some fantastic photos with it and cannot praise it enough. I routinely enlarge my photos to make 8x10's and 11x14 size enlargements with absolutely no noticeable distortion of loss of detail in the pictures.     Canon also makes more "professional" equipment but at a greater price. The Canon EOS 5D Mark II is a 21 megapixel professional choice selling for around $2,100-2,400. It has amazing features and a digital sensor that is larger than the Canon Rebel XSi model.  The Canon EOS model 50D is another excellent professional choice. It sells for around $1,400. and has 15 Megapixel quality. It has an ISO sensitivity of up to 12,800.     If you prefer to use Nikon equipment I strongly recommend the Nikon D-90 which has similiar qualities and features as the Canon Rebel XSi. The D-90 sells for around $1,000. and has 12.3 MP quality with and max ISO sensitivity of 3,200.    Nikon also makes the D-200 model (cost is about $1,400.) and is a 10.2 MP camera with max. 1/8,000 shutter speed and max. 3,200 ISO sensitivity.     The Nikon D-300 model (cost about $1,800) and has 12.3 MP with max 1/8000 shutter speed and max. 6,400 ISo sensitivity.    The Nikon D-700 is about "top of the line" (selling for around $3,000.) The D-700 has 12. 1 MP, 1/8000 max shutter speeds and up to 25,600 max ISO sensitivity.    If you want to learn MORE about the technical specifications of each camera, I suggest you go directly to their websites listed below. Learn what ISO sensitivity, shutter speeds, megapixels and other technical terms are all about.     www.usa.canon.com  www.nikonusa.com    Good Luck

eZKFfD76aa	Something an artist once told me, you can learn skill with practice but you are born with talent.  Composing isn't a skill, it is a talent.  Creating something original out of your head is always a talent.  It can be honed into a skill, but the talent has to be there to start with.  Nothing wrong with that and playing guitar well is a talent too, but a separate one.      If you have the talent to create songs, surround yourself with people who do too.  Working with each other will bring out all of your skills.

I would ask around, sometimes there are flyers.  With message boards and internet you could at least find some online connections.  If you are i nschool ask around.

The size of the image is whatever you you want to display it in.  They really are not related.  You, the user, pick each factor.    So, for the big lumpy pixels, just drop the resolution.  On your screen, the image will probably shrink because, no matter what resolution your image is, your monitor will want to display it at 72 Pixels Per Inch.  Just "Zoom in" with the magnifying glass tool and the image will get bigger so that you can see the big lumpy pixels.    In Photoshop, you can go to the image menu and change the image size to whatever you want and at the resolution you like.  That way, if you are going to print the image, it will show up on the paper at the size you selected.

A big problem for me though, is that usually I'm pretty sure that I believe in God, but when it comes to heaven and hell I'm not so sure. I mean...it's not only that I can't imagine each of them, but also that I'm not sure I would want there to be. Does that make me unreligious?

fZGEVA1maa	Acting can be a pretty wonderful thing. It's addicting!    I agree with the first woman, stay the heck away from Barbizon, total ripoff!     Make sure you're taking Speech 1 & Speech 2 in school. [please tell me they still have those two classes] By taking these two classes it'll help you get used to being up in front of people.     Yes, take acting classes.     Anytime you go to an audition and you get a callback to same audition [ie., callback], wear the same thing you wore the first time. Trust me, they're going to remember the girl in the red sweater with the big pink bow on the back.     Learn to deal with rejection. Chances are it's going to happen a lot. It doesn't matter if it your local community theatre, a commercial your auditioning for, or Broadway. You're going to be rejected for more parts than your picked for.     Steve Martin spent his summers working at Disney Land and Knots Berry Farms as a performer. And look how her turned out. Think about that.     While you're still in school, make sure you audition for the school play. This will get you used to auditioning. And talk to your drama teacher at school. If you don't have a drama teacher, then talk to the Speech teacher. If you ask around, one of your teachers is very familiar with the performing arts and they can give you a lot of really good advice. Maybe even take you under their wing.    Break a leg!|`|Ik9Xq744aa	ok i am an actress and am actually currently working on a film.here is some advise.dont ever let an agent make you pay them up front.Dont ever go to barbizon ....a total ripoff.Work on your acting take acting classes,if you have money go to a school that is involved with acting,get an agent or go to a talent agency.Also to answer your other question,it is an amazing feeling to be an actress,being able to be somebody you are not and the feeling is amazing.SOME other advise would be ,you know how sometimes you can get embarrased in ACTINGclasses or something when you have to work with  somebody you dont know,well be the one who stands out and isnt shy and is outgoing so the other person will feel the need to be better.good luck :)
AA12016117	For a start, it's the fact that people (and animals) were mummified at all.  This must say something about the beliefs.  Why did they go through the mummifying process, why were they bound up?  The bandages can also tell about what sort of material and weaving were used.  Also, how did people believe the process would preserve the bodies for eternity, and what for?    If you're talking about ancient Egypt, the internal organs were placed in canopic jars.  Scarabs and amulets were placed between the bandages.  Especially in the cases of royals or wealthy people, all the things they needed in life were placed in the tomb with them, like figurines of servants, chairs, carriages, beds, etc, even food.  In the case of Tutankhamun, I think even flowers were placed there which disintegrated at the opening of the tomb when the air was let in, which shows a poignant touch of somebody placing them there for remembrance or love.  This would show that they believed in an after life, and that they would need the same things later.    You might also mean mummies from South America, or China, so do have a look at the sites I've attached below.    Edit: forgot to say that we're able to tell what they ate by the contents of their stomachs and the state of their teeth, and what methods, if any, of medication were used.

okZW8Ld5aa	You probably feel guilty and sad because you're a good person and its hard to let something die that you've put time and effort into. But at the same time, you know it wasn't mean to be. You're definitely pointed in the right direction if you have the strength to give up a relationship because you are self aware enough to know its not what you want, not going to make you happy, and not going to work in the long run.    That's great that you feel free, reborn and happy. Eventually when you're feeling up to it, you'll probably be able to use this energy and enthusiasm and put it into something great and exciting.     I can relate to the way you are feeling. It doesn't feel good. If you live in a subarctic feeling or close to it, your feelings of dislike for things you once enjoyed may be enhanced by the lack of sunlight you are getting.     I am sort of in the same state at the moment. Every idea and everything seems meaningless to me. For me, it seems as though we are living for the wrong reasons.

f4d1b694bbe5d754965c49f945a6756daa	Thomas died young, and Sarah died in childbirth.     He had stepbrothers and sisters though, I believe all named Johnston, and the family moved almost together. The Lincolns moved to Little Pigeon Forge Creek in Indiana, and shortly thereafter some of the Hanks family, including Dennis, moved there as well. When the Milk Sick claimed everyone in the Hanks household except Dennis, Dennis moved in with Thomas, Sarah Bush Johnston Lincoln, Sarah Lincoln, and Abe.       My favorite quote from Sandburg's Life of Lincoln revolves around Dennis, at the time Abe was born, Nancy asked him if he wanted to hold the new baby, Sandburg wrote "Now you be keerful Dennis, you ain't never holt a boy before".     When the Lincoln & Johnston family moved to Macon County Illinois in 1830, there were already members of the Hanks family there, and were able to give some assistance while they built a cabin. Everyone suffered during the winter that followed, called the Winter of the Deep Snows in those days.     In later life, Lincoln had problems with his step siblings, particularly the ones in Coles County, evidently, some of them were rather unlucky in business, including one who was a distiller.

The africans from the direct south and west, arabs from the south east and geneghis khan from direct east.  Europe was basically North Italy, North France, the west half of east europe and the northern regions of europe like the scandinavian countries.  Everywhere else was controlled by 'foreigners' so Genghis Khan did whatever other great conquer like alexander the great did and killed whoever got in his way.    There was nothing particulrarly cruel about genghis khan, everyone during the time and after genghis khan up until the 1980s did the same thing in war, murder all the men and boys and rape all the women. This practice is not unique to any society.  The only difference is that they cover up this practice in our history books because we don't like to acknowledge our dirty past.  The victors write the history and are usually extremely bias in their own favour.     For example, the USA war books write that the Japanese tourted POW but the Americans also used touture to get information and sometime just for fun (like abu garihb) soldiers are just assholes, no matter which country they are from.    Back to the point, we say the taliban are "evil" and cruelwhich they are, for beheadings, but we won't say how when our planes bomb innocent people by "accident" thta is cruel.  What about when our planes bomb funerals when they "mistake" it for terrorist gatherings.  Point is all sides in war are dirty, all sides kill innocents on purpose to convey to the enemey they are dangerous, there is no real morality in war.  Quite the contare its a battle of who is willing to kill rape and pillage the other most!
056cd57fe1506567da3828f5884632ecaa	Um.. nope! 1984 was just written in the 1940's, when 1984 seemed forever in the future!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Yes, but not for 2009.    It was written in 1948. Orwell turned the last two digits round. When he wrote it, 1984 was a LONG way in the future.|`|iHtskXisaa	Off the top of my head, I think "1984" was published in 1948.  He just transposed the digits to give a date somewhere in the future.|`|v70p2kgWaa	1984 was actually a political comentary about where the then current Soviet Union regime had screwed up.  Orwell was a socialist but felt that the USSR had made some big errors and he was pointing out where those errors would lead if they were adapted by the rest of the world.  While I believe that we can take some points from the book and learn from them, the original context the book was written under has actually collapsed.

Btw, it's "your," not "you're" :)    Edit: I think a great thing about a cliched topic is writing about it in some way that is least expected...a new insight into the matter. Keep writing! :)|`|hv55P0loaa	In my opinion, it is hard to critique someone's work, especially in poetry, because it is an artists piece and only they know what they are trying to say. If I had to say anything about this though it would be that it is usually frowned upon to use abbreviations in your work (jokin') even though you are trying to piece together your rhyme scheme. Also there is that minor error mistaking "you're" for "your". Go into more detail with your work. Although it is easy to find meaning in this, I think you can go farther with it. Hope this helped? lol|`|AA12301704	Don't make excuses or point out your "faults". Let us do that. LOL.  Do use spell-check.  Don't write because you are "bored".  Write from the heart.

AA10729675	It is like Greece and China:  their population is the same and speaks the same language (or just about) than centuries ago.  Ancient Egypt is the one that was so powerful and impressive with pyramids, temples, mummies, strange characters on the walls (drawings).  Modern Egypt is a country like all others with cars, and machines, and terrorists.|`|aOqoo4H7aa	Ancient Egypt is usually considered the period of time between 3150 BC with the unification of upper and lower Egypt under the legendary king Meni, and ending in 31 BC when the Roman Empire under Augustus conquered it and annexed it as a province, ending the reign of pharaohs.  Interestingly, the last dynasty of pharaohs were actually Mesopotamian, the Ptolemies, a family instated in 332 BC after Alexander the Great conquered Egypt, and the daughter of Ptolemy XII, Cleopatra VII, was the last pharaoh of Egypt.  After that, Egypt enters into mainly Roman history.|`|kEZP3BmBaa	Ancient Egypt is old day pyramid building pharoahs ruling egypt.  Egypt is modern, has cars, and is in the same place as ancient egypt, but its in the year 2009
AA12000171	Well sometimes, YES  this frequently happens in comedy movies, as actors add their own "spices" as you might call it.  However it does happen in other movie genres as well.    It all depends on the director to allow it or not as he/she is responsible of how the final cut of the movie would be.    *Sometimes actors suggest to the director, changing something before shooting the scene.  Director can say yes or no.    *Sometimes director asks actors if they have any suggestions regarding a scene script.    *Sometimes actors get caught up in the moment and improvise during shooting with no prior planning.  Then it is up to the director to accept it or re-shoot the scene.|`|5RoYyprkaa	No actor ever recites lines exactly like they were written. It's called improv. The actors add their own twist, but I'm not sure if they can do a whole lot with the production. The director would prevent that from happening to such an extent that his work was lost in the actor's portrayal and ideas.|`|GgB6bLhTaa	Yes, sometimes they adlib.  It depends on the actor and the director as to whether or not they need permission.  Every situation and set is different.|`|JB8samC7aa	Depends on the production. Much of "Young Frankenstein" was improvised on set, but I would never do "Death of a Salesman" other than how it was written.  Original works tend to allow more latitude. Well known and respected works, not so much, although directors will cut parts for length. "Hamlet" almost always has bits cut; Kenneth Brannagh was the first director to ever put the entire play on screen.  I worked on a movie in '95 that was entirely improvised by the actors.|`|fZGEVA1maa	It depends on how much experience you have.    I've been involved in theatre for more than 25 years and to change a line isn't a big thing for me. I'm not shy about it.     I've worked with actors who during a show have drawn a complete blank. And lucky me, they're the ones giving me my cue line. So I've come up with ways to actually get out all of their lines to make them somehow sound like my own. It happened in, "Charlie's Aunt", I was the Aunt. I don't ever want to be put in that situation again. But, I was able to do it because I knew the script like the back of my hand.    I've also done Audience Participation Murder Mystery Dinner Theatre. Those are a lot of fun. When people do what they're supposed to do, however, sometimes you have an actor or two who think the show revolves around them. So they take it upon themselves to start ad-libing ever other line. As a director, I once fired someone for that. He had gotten to full of himself, didn't want to work with others, thought he was the only talent in the show so he was gone.     The best advice I can give you is this...    Never...never...take the advice of a fellow actor when it comes to a production that you're working on together. Why? Because no matter where you are, theatre is cut throat. People will give you the wrong advie on purpose to get you fired so they can get the part themselves or get one of their friends in.     If there is something you're wondering about, go to the Stage Manager or the Director. It's their job to help you. And by helping you, it's only going to make the play better.     Also, never tick off the props master, your dresser, lights person, or sound person. These people can really screw things up for you during a performance if they so choose. So, keep them happy. I'm not saying you have to be their best friend. Just treat them with respect. Because they have the thankless jobs.    Good luck & Break a leg!|`|4qVXodtnaa	Yup, they can do that.    Before the filming of The Lord of The Rings, the main actors went through the script with the director, Peter Jackson, and they suggested ideas for the script. Some would work, some wouldn't.  During the filming, the script was constantly being rewritten, the actors started not bothering to learn their lines, because they knew they would have to learn different lines the next day!    But discuss it with the director first, because if you start improvising (especially badly) without their permission, then you will not be in their good books...|`|d42a27ec46b61c343bffe850b129f3a6aa	Ive heard that they do, and some have lost their job because of it.    :o)
j5Apt8hWaa	One of the last PMA bulletins issued last quarter showed an actual increase in film.usage.    There is a huge group of people now using "Holga and Diana" LOMO cameras which all use 120 film.      Kodak actually introduced a new film emulsion last year     Film is not going anywhere fast.  Art Photographers are still using black and white film and are still hand printing, archival prints for sale in art galleries.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	Calm down. Film isn't going to become extinct any time soon. I also shoot film 100%.     Kodak just introduced a new film - Ektar 100 - last year. They have improved the Portra line since its introduction. (I'm waiting for Spring so I can start using Ektar)    Fuji has been advertising their film, in photography magazines, with professional photographers who use the film. They also re-introduced Velvia 50 slide film in 2007.    The Feb. 2009 issue of Shutterbug has an excerpt from the Third Edition of Steve Anchell's book "The Darkroom Cookbook".  Books don't get published unless there is an expectation of making a profit.    There is no doubt that it may become harder to find a good selection of film in local stores but its widely available on-line. I buy all my film from places like Adorama or B&H or Unique Photo or KEH.     Last year's Tokyo Used Camera Show drew more younger Japanese buyers. Read the article at http://www.shutterbug.com by typing '30th tokyo used camera show' in the Search box. This will pull up the article "Classic Cameras", Sept. 2008.    I'll be 62 in April so I'm part of what you call "older generations". It isn't that I refuse to learn how to use a digital camera - its pure economics. I know myself well enough to know I'd have to have a full-frame DSLR. I'd also want lenses that matched what I currently use - 16mm full-frame fisheye, 21mm, 24mm, 35mm, 50mm f1.4, 58mm f1.2, 35-70mm f3.5 & 70-210mm f4 constant aperture zooms, 100mm macro, 85mm f1.7 portrait lens. Plus a flash and bracket comparable to what I have and a macro ring flash. I figure it would cost me $7K to $9K to do digitally what I now do with my 35mm film system. I can buy a lot of film and have it processed and printed for a lot less. Currently, my total cost for 36 prints is about $14.00. I seldom shoot more than 2 rolls a week.|`|g8kIjpwSaa	I don't think they'll be getting rid of film anytime soon. Not with all the enthusiasts like you out there. As long as there is a demand for a product there will be a market for it. Digital photography just makes certain professions easier, more efficient and less costly. Everything in the world is printed on a press these days, but you can still buy lithography supplies. Unless you know something I don't, film in't going anywhere............except Polariods.|`|AA12339318	Not every manufacturer is "getting rid" of film.  Those that have are doing so for purely business reasons and those businesses certainly have that right.  Kodak, for instance, is under not moral or ethical obligation to keep producing a product that is not a profitable for them as the new technology.  Polaroid, is another that gave the public PLENTY of notice that they were discontinuing a product line.|`|AA11148143	My local drug store stopped accepting 35mm for processing on  2/1/09. And note how pricey paper and film are getting because of the cost of silver. I feel for you - I still have all my old darkroom gear - but I fear it's almost inevitable. When the market gets too small producers just quit producing and there's really not much that can be done about it.|`|iL1tYfJMaa	what would make you think they will stop making film for cameras.  Not sure where you are getting your information. Film will always be available. Its just getting more and more expensive to buy and get developed.|`|m4G9jqgPaa	This is an aspect of technology that upsets people in all subjects. For example, there are a few recording artists who refuse to record on anything but vinyl, because they maintain it still has certain advantages over CDs.|`|Efd1G2loaa	Who said film was going anywhere?|`|e185922a05d6a34cd1ab11b31d21af0baa	If by getting rid of film you mean 35mm roll film I doubt this will happen considering that even to this date you can still get 110 film.   Photographic processes are always in a constant state of evolution.  Daguerreotype, wetplate collodion,dry plate, tintypes, cyanotypes, gum bichromate,bromoil perhaps you have heard of them?  These are all photographic processes  of the past which have not been in popular use for well over 100 years.  However not being in popular use does not mean they are dead and in fact in 2009 you still have quite a few people who are rediscovering these old photographic processes for fine art purposes.  If you don't believe me, just visit this site http://www.alternativephotography.com/pr...  Film whether we are talking roll or sheet has its own aesthetic character apart from digital processes and without a doubt as long as there is a niche market you will have companies like Ilford or say photographers formulary who cater to fine art/darkroom photographers out there.    However, don't think that digital is a modern process, because actually the way that digital photographers work is more similar to how photography was done 140 years ago with wetplate collodion.  Like the digital photographer who takes a photo and sees the immediate result and decides whether to keep it or delete it, same can be said with the wetplate collodion photographer although just a bit slower.  The wetplate photographer would make an exposure, immediately develop it, and decided whether to scrape off the emulsion, re-emulsify it and make another expsoure.  So in a way perhaps the digital method is the more traditional method if you want to think of it in relation to other photographic techniques|`|KNN4a8uYaa	So far it's not really trending that direction.  Remember what happened with Polaroid - yes, Polaroid left the film business but then Fujifilm stepped in with their packfilm to replace the 100 series films, going so far as make sure they more or less work like the favorites like Type 669 allowing the films be used for emulsion lifts and image transfers. Ilford/Harman's funding a group to rerelase Type 600 Polaroid film.      Even the Meijer by my place stocks Fuji Neopan ACROS - alot of it.  And that's a Meijer!  I could buy some Cap'n Crunch, a bottle of Scotch, a pair of socks, and some timothy hay for my guinea pigs, following it up by buying some rather high grade traditional black and white film.      And this is outside of internet ordering sites, like B&H or Freestyle.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that perhaps we should hold film's eulogy after it passes on.  There is still a market for it, and given Kodak, Fuji, and Ilford/Harman's devotion is very heartening.|`|qXAvXHdYaa	Well, not everyone has access to a darkroom or the space to build one or learn how to mix and play around with chemicals either.    To each their own.  Companies will continue to make film so long as their is a viable market for it or the government passes a law that forces them to continue making film(you could pray for that option).    The truth is that photography has always been a profession that needs to continually move along with the new technologies.  It just seems a lot worse now than before because the technology is skyrocketing.    We either move along with the technology or get left behind.  As a professional, I cannot afford to be left behind and outdone by the competition.    Embrace the positive aspects of digital.  There are plenty of training course available for Photoshop and other programs we use.
