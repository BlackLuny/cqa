20090129040919AAnBeI4	Pets;Dogs	Westie as second dog?	Hey I already have a 7 month old golden retriever x cocker spaniel, he has a lovely temperament as you would expect from the breed. I have recently got a few more hours at work and feel a bit guilty about leaving him on his own. We have been thinking about getting another dog to keep him company and have an opportunity to re home a 4 month old west highland terrier girl. I have always had golden retrievers and wonder what a westie is like as a pet?   And also weather Westies enjoy other breeds (aka my golden x cocker boy) for company?   Any help would really be appreciated!

20090129045122AAKLnE9	Pets;Dogs	Please read! Btw, how to convince my mom to get me a dog?	Okay, so one day, my BFF and I were taking a walk on my hill, and we were going to go around in a circle back to my house, and then my neighbors dogs, the neighbors about 2 houses down across the road from us, their dogs came to us, and my BFF was like, "Hey, look, he's so thin, it's like you can see his ribs!" and I looked, and you could. So I felt really bad for the dog, and we thought we would get some food to feed him, so we did and when we came back, before we fed him, we could FEEL his ribs! And we fed the dog, but the other dog didn't seem hungry, and then now, I figured that the owners only fed the other dog for some reason and not this one WE were feeding. So, we went home to ask my mom if we could keep the dog because no one was ever home at where they lived, and then she said "NO!" so we went back, and we saw the dogs on my neighbors lawn, and then a woman beat the dog WE fed. And then we went back, and complained to my mom that no one was ever home at the house they lived in, and that every day, and every night, they were outside. The dog even went through our trash outside, looking for food. And she still said no. So I thought, maybe we  could ask the owner, but I know my mom wouldn't let me.      Now, I want a dog real badly, because I've never had my own dog in my life before, and I want one so badly, that I even dream about getting a dog! But my mom just won't let me, and she said when I'm 16 she will, but by then, I won't want a dog for sure! And she says that I'm too irresponsible, and that I can't take care of my cat, but if I wasn't taking care of my cat, he wouldn't be very fat, and oh, I don't know, ALIVE right now! I want to convince her to get me a dog, because I'm getting real jealous of my friends. They all have dogs, or at least know what it feels like, but I don't. So please, don't tell me I can't!

We weighed her last night & she was 7.6 lbs.       For about a week, she has been VERY whiney & clingy. The minute I come home, if I don't pick her up right away, she starts meowing & following at my heels. It doesn't bother me, but she's never done this before.      She's still been going to the bathroom every day & it looks normal-- not runny, no blood, no worms, etc.       She's an only pet & has never been outside. She's very sweet & adorable...      She was spayed in July '08. She's 11 months old. Indoors only. We can take her to the vet tomorrow if needed.

When I got him at 8 weeks old he was emaciated had worms and fleas/ticks, even though he was the biggest in the litter.   He used to shake a lot and we thought he was cold, but he got very sick and we thought he would die. We called the vet who said he had rickets because of malnutrition. He got injections and tablets and put on a lot of weight and was doing very well until recently. He has started to lose a lot of weight again. I have been giving him a lot of food as well as calcium tablets, garlic conditioning tablets and regular worm doses.   I cant get the vet to come out to the house at the moment as he is very busy and Im not able to take him.   Do you think there is something wrong with him again or is he losing weight because of the bad start in life?

20090129052130AANH3xi	Pets;Cats	For those who know what's cats can eat/drink and be healthy?	First off xD Soy milk is okay right? I heard that that's pretty much the main ingredient in that whiskas stuff. I bought it for a while and when I tasted a bit (=3) it tasted like cheese.      But anyway I'm wondering if it's okay to give her normal soy milk (so nice, so good brand) because of how much sugar is in it? (13g a cup)      I usually only give her like a lid full of real milk every couple months and was wondering if I gave her soy milk would I be able to give her a larger amount more often?      Also I know garlic and onion are bad but that's pretty much it. Anything else besides house plants I should be worried about?      (I've given her peas, corn, and a bit of olive before and she seemed to like them)

She was very friendly and hungry. I opened the door and she came right in. So obviously she is an indoor cat. She's litter box trained and has recently had a bath. She also has an indention in her fur like she had a collar on.   We have decided to keep her but I think she might be pregnant. Her belly isn't big or anything but her nipples are larger than our other cats and very pink. It makes no difference if she is pregnant, we will keep her anyway. I would just like to know some of the signs of pregnancy.    Her being pregnant is the only reason I can think of that someone would drop her off. She looks to have been well taken care of. What do you think?      Also I did post her on some local lost and found stuff and no one has called.

20090129054220AAlxQNn	Pets;Dogs	Elderly dog / shelter cat. Do you have any advice?	Hi. This week we adopted a 4 year old cat from our local shelter.    We have a 9 year old Bichon (Daisy) who has juvenile cataracts and has been basically blind since before she was 1.   Last spring we had to have our other dog put to sleep. He had been a very dominating boy.  And once he was gone Daisy really came out of her shell and now is like a playful puppy again. She seemed lonely though so we wanted to get her a docile playmate. That's why we got an older cat versus a kitten.   The cat keeps hissing and slapping at the dog. It still has it's claws.   The dog is scared and keeps flinching when we try to pet her and is hiding.   I have tried to keep the cat in another room so they can sniff each other through the door. I bring the cat out in a carrier so the dog can "see" it and sniff. Although she won't go near the cage as she is afraid she'll get slapped. I have tried squirting the cat after the hiss/slap...   I realize it might take time for them to get along.    My question is, how long should I let the kitty bully the dog before saying "okay that's enough"? What would you say is a good time limit?   Thank you very, very much!!!!

The puppy is about 2months old (so i guess around that time the puppy will get exercise around the house) and the weather's still pretty cold...i'm worried that it'll get abit too cold and stuff.

She is very good about playing with us at home, gets plenty of people time, and dog interaction time. But here is my problem:      My dog becomes very energetic with dogs her size and age. She will start chasing them, running laps around them, sometimes will accidentally run into them (tackling them), and with some dogs, will start wrestling with them. I have never seen her get aggressive to where she growls, shows her teeth, or anything. One thing I have noticed is that she is more talkative than any other dog out there, as she barks ALL the time at the dogs she is playing with. But when I put her in the pen with the larger dogs, she won't act that way...by wrestling, barking all the time, etc. She acts more shy with the bigger dogs.      I have been taking her to the dog park for the past couple of weeks. And I have noticed 2 types of owners. 1 type encourages the "puppy wrestling" and seem to be very knowledgeable in puppy behavior. They all tell me this is normal. Then there are the other types which I have started to notice lately, that seem to get very pissy and somewhat physical with my dog in stopping her for wrestling with their dogs. I have been questionable about their actions.         So my questions are these:   1) Is it normal for my Aussie to "play wrestle," bark at other dogs while playing, and to be a little rough with other puppies her size/age.   2) What would be the polite way to deal with other owners who are grabbing her by her collar to stop her from wrestling, nudging her away from their dogs, etc?      My impression is this. People should not bring their dogs to the park and expect them to dig holes and sniff each others butts. They should expect animals to play like....well...animals. I see my Aussie as doing just that.

I'm not strictly in a position to get either yet, but as soon as I'm not working long hours anymore (hopefully in the next few months) I am going to looking to buy a small dog.   I need a dog that is small enough to live in my flat and if I go out to see clients (I'm a personal trainer) I can take it with me so it's not on its own all day and gets plenty of exercise.   Has anyone out there owned either dog and can recommend it or knows enough about dog breeds to advise on which would be happiest living in a flat and following me around all day?

My dog  wouldnt stop shaking and got scared when i try to take her outside she starts to shake harder and sits down like shes in trouble. shes been shaking all day.

Shes not barking when people come through the door all she does is lay down and tremble.     Today: Turns out she had some type of virus. Shes got not fever and After she got a shot of anti biotics from the doctor and some pain medicine she started to eat and drink some water but then we all noticed something. we put her outside to go to the bathroom but she wont go up the steps and wont move when we put her in the grass. Well i came home this evening and she wont use her back legs at all. she just drags them. shes been eating and drinking but wont use the bathroom at all and hasnt since yesterday morning. She cant even walk. Does anyone have an idea of whats going on with her?
20090129054856AAk9uoa	Pets;Dogs	Older female dog peeing in house?	we are fostering an 8-9 year old golden retriever female that was used as a breeder in a puppy mill.  she had been adopted from a rescue where she lived in a house for almost a year.  the family had problems with her peeing in the house.  after spending several thousand dollars at the vet over a period of time, they decided to give her back to the rescue (and hence why I am fostering her now).  I take her out to go potty once every two to three hours.  She's taking Proin.  She doesn't seem to drink water excessively and she's in great health besides possible allergies (which she is taking medication).  However, this morning we woke up to pee all over the dining room and kitchen floors.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  Even with pee pads, she will still go on the floor and sometimes right in front of me.  At that point I just take her outside.  I need help!

20090129055338AAPoaCe	Pets;Dogs	Why is my 5month old puppy determined to poop in her crate?	I have a Silky Terrier that I have had for 3months, she is 5 months old. Her schedule has been the same for the last 3 months. She goes outside at the same times everyday. Prior to her being spayed, she would poop in her crate 3-4 days a week. The week after she was spayed there were no accidents aside from her urinating a couple of times, which was expected.     Now she is completely healed and you would think that I never spent any time house training her. She poops before I get up in the morning, she poops when I'm in the shower, she poops while I'm at work. I have to bathe her 3-4 times a week, which according to the vet is wrong, but she stinks! I have completely exhausted all of the ideas I could come up with, short of diapering her permanently. Everybody I know who has a dog, even a small breed dog, tells me that she shouldn't mess in her crate, yet she does...daily. And as much as I hate to say it, it is extremely frustrating to wake up to crap, go to work to crap, come home to crap and go to bed to crap.    Does anyone have any suggestions?     P.S. I work 8hrs a day, I have no choice, and it has been a the case for the last 3 months that for 8-9hrs of the day, she is in her crate while I work for a living. I will NOT permit her the run of the house since she can't be trusted in a space as small as her crate.    Thank you
20090129063035AAy9qJx	Pets;Dogs	How to get a around 6 week old to stop nipping at everything?	My boyfriend got a puppy and he was about a month old at the time. Vet guessed it but no one really knows his age.Now before I get nasty remarks, it wasn't up to him he was at work when a 11 year old comes up to him on a bike and sold it to him because he said he couldn't handle him. The poor little guy was full of fleas and worms. Anyways hes always nipping even while sleeping on the bed with us he'll wake up in the middle of the night and start chewing on me. I do the taping on the nose but that fires him more. My other dog doesn't even like being around him. Is there anything I can do or is this something hes going to grow out of.
20090129063337AAHTEvH	Pets;Cats	10 year old female cat urinating in house - please help!?	I have a 10 year old female cat who started urinating in the house a few months ago. Ever since she was about 1 year old she's gone outside to do her business and we've never really had a problem with her urinating inside the house - probably only about twice in her life.      She used a litter box when she was a kitten for a few months and then we trained her to go outside but when we tried to reintroduce her to it the other day to try to get her to stop urinating on the carpet, she seemed terrified of it and scratched and meowed if you tried to place her in it to give her the idea of what to use it for.      We got new neighbours a few months ago and they brought a pet cat with them which harrasses our cat and it often comes onto our property and they either have a massive cat fight or our cat runs inside for safety. We think that it's possible that our cat is urinating in the house because of the simple fact that she's scared to go outside, especially at night because that's when she seems to commit the act.      We feel like the last resort is just to lock her out of the house but that would mean that she's more exposed and more vulnerable to our nextdoor neighbour's cat. Outdoor cats also tend to have a shorter life-span and we really don't want to have to subject her to that if there's another way to get around the problem.      Anyway, any suggestions or advice?
20090129063307AAiRqJj	Pets;Dogs	My 4 year old Beagle was vomiting,  has the runs and will not eat..she's been to the vet..?	after x-rays and blood work the vet wants to treat the symptoms since the problem is not yet obvious! Problem being the dog will not eat a thing I offer to her, (boiled chicken, boiled rice, her favorite dry food, wet food) I even tried removing food from her for 48 hours and she still has no desire to eat. The vet says since she is drinking water I could add baby food to her water, I guess because it is low in sodium and easy on the stomach. Any suggestions on what brand and flavor I should try offering my dog? Thanks in advance! she still has mild diarrhea and is spitting up white foam! (I just spoke with the vet less than 12 hours ago and stay in constant contact, i just figured maybe someone on here has experienced this before)

I was told to give them a good start for live food and I can't seem to get my hands on earthworms which I hear is good for them. One problem they both seem to have is breaking into them cause they are a little hard. I would think the water would make them a little soft but you think I should crush a small part of them or let them take care of it?

He has a two gallon tank, I clean and condition it regularly, and he seems fine in every way. The only problem is, lately the tips of his front fins (the ones hanging down like whiskers, not the the little moving ones) have turned a blueish white color. Is he sick? What should I do?

20090129065743AArZGPu	Pets;Horses	I hate My horses Name. Anyone want to help?	OKI, so his name is Petey. I have an Uncle Pete and a little cousin named after him we call Petey, so its kinda weird calling my horse that, I need some good, fun unique names that are similar to Petey. He does kinda know his name, although I feel he doesn't really respond to his name, just the sound of my voice. He doesn't really react when I say his name anyway, he just looks at me, so I feel that changing his name isn't to horrible.   Here is his description:   He is 15 hands, sorrel with a blaze and four short socks. He isnt a super flashy guy, and is older (probably 17 or so). He is a super mellow guy, and I can trust anyone to ride him. Easy to catch, saddle and so on.........Although he does have some anger issues when it comes to his food (only to his pasture mate though).   My other horses name is Angus, which to me is awesome and really unique, so I would like to have Petey to have a cool name as well.      Please no names like Blaze, Sweetie or anything boring. i am looking to a really cool name that will stand out and has a two syllable sound to it.  Any help is greatly appreciated and I look foward to reading your ideas......Oh and he isnt ever going to be shown, so I just need a barn name!!!!   here is a pic of him.    http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z176/... 
20090129071815AAkQMKT	Pets;Dogs	How do I stop my dog barking when I'm not home?	I have a dog thats a little over a year old. Since I got  her at 8 weeks I have been with her almost constantly.      I havent been working due to a leg injury so she has had constant company, other than a few hours here or there when I was going somewhere dogs werent able to go.      The problem I have is that I have now started college so I am out of the house more often, I get home at lunch time and all to take her out, but the point is shes alone for 3 hours or so at a time, about 6 times a week.      I have had a neighbor come to me saying that my dog is barking and howling basically from 5 mins after I leave right up until I get back home.      She doesnt normally bark, only when she gets startled or something. She tends not to bark at other dogs either, even if they are going nuts at her.      So as I have had a neighbor come to me, Id like to try and sort the problem out before neighbors start calling in noise complaints or anything like that.      Obviously I cant tell the dog to stop barking as I am not here to do so.      I know why she is barking, its because she feels abandoned because like I said, shes rarely been alone since birth.      I just dont know how to go about fixing the problem, especially as Im not in thehouse when its happening.      Any help would be much appreciated!

20090129070353AAnzxd4	Pets;Fish	Is it true that female pregnant guppys deliver every 30 days? (please ONLY EXPERTS)?	Hello to all   I've read in another question that female Guppys can keep the sperm and deliver babies every 30 days, is this true?   I'm concern because right now I'm waiting for one of my guppys to deliver, I put her in another tank, a smaller one, like a "hospital tank"   The thing is I thought that after she deliver I could put her back in the main tank, and wait for the fry to grow enough to put them in the main tank, but in that way probably I will end with dozens of fish, and don't get me wrong, I love them, but I don't have room for so many! I'm just waiting to save some of this fry but I have no room for dozens!   So, also I've read that it's better to let "nature follow its course" and let the mom and the other guppys just eat the fry and some of them maybe can survive... I don't know what to do, I mean I know nature acts that way but for me is kind of cruel... what can I do?   Should I put her back in the main tank to deliver and pray for some of the fry survive? or just leave her in the "hospital tank" 'till she delivers and then breed the fry? How many babies they can have?   I don't know what to do, I'm concern to end with an overpopulation of fish!      Please, any advise? This is serious, so please don't make jokes!   Thanks   PS:   1.- By the way I have a 20 gal tank with filter and heater, right now I have two male guppys in that tank, because two of my guppys died three days ago for unknown reasons, the other ones are good, but I'm keeping this two males together with no other fish, 'cause I'm waiting for the fry, should I buy some other females (like 4) to put in the main tank to avoid the male fight?   2.- The "hospital tank" is a 2 gal tank with filter, no heater but the water temperature is around 74(F) which is the room temperature

20090129073440AAgsYwr	Pets;Cats	My cat died i have a question ?	my cat ran away some months ago and kept living in the back yard in a storage bin. I could not catch her for the life  of me. The other day she just walked up to me and let me take her. I brought her in and i fed her. She ate so much food and water. But within a hour her nose started to run. She kept following me and my family around and just waiting by the doors for us. She then stopped eating the next morning and started to walk a little off. Then she just stayed in one spot and her nose kept running almost like drool. She then last night could not hold her bowels and started having seizures. My wife held her in her arms wrapped in a blanket and i rubbed her head. then she just died after all the seizures she stopped them after we picked her up, she looked at us and meowed and died. What do you think happened to her. We were going to take her to the vets tomorrow as per the appointment, but she did not make it. We are all shook up we had her for 12 years. She looked fat when we brought her in the house. And i know she was eating because we would leave food outside for her. she also would go through our garbage and take what she wants. Anyway any rest to the matter would be great ! please.    We are at a loss.    thanks
20090129074614AAfP5He	Pets;Dogs	The nerve of some people ?	Ok, APBT and Bully breed lovers, give a listen to this.       Some guy emails me about a post I had posted the other day about paying 3 grand for his dog. Aparently, it was a "blue pit bull" he paid for and then was looking a free pit bull puppy. I posted that he was scammed if he paid 3 grand for a "blue pit bull".       Ok, so the dude emails me back saying that if I knew about reputable breeders, I would know 3 grand for a puppy with health guarentees aint bad ? I mean, any BYB or puppymiller can give a health guarentee. I asked him did he know about OFA or CERF ? How about the parents ? Are they registered by a REAL registry or some fake BYB registry ? Did he know anything about hip scores ?      So my question is, Is 3 grand for a puppy that only has "health guarentees" a good deal ? To me, I think it's a joke.

20090129073947AAPbIDq	Pets;Other - Pets	What PETA is really about...?	PETA is all about animals right, while animals welfare is what is important... PETA think animals have all the same rights as humans, they think that animals shouldnt be used in anything! including being pets... many people support them not knowing that PETA wants to take their pets away... they think they are like our slaves.  I think it is very important that people learn what they are all about...  They are a horrible group that should not be supported, and if u support them you are a horrible person too...     The creater of PETA, the person who started it all was asked a question...    "If you were driving down the road and a squirrel ran out from one side of the road, and a small boy from the other, which way would you swerve?"  she answered, " It would make no difference, they are the same to me."    Who the hell would answer like that, and she was the one who started PETA!! they are all horrible in my eyes!!    Also... PETA gets many donations from celebrities, but the celebrites also donate to cancer foundations along with aid/hiv foundations... these founations NEED to use lab animals to help find cures... but PETA wants all animals to be free of this... it makes no sence to me that celebrites donate to both when without the animals no cures can be made...    can someone please explain what kind of world we live in!?!? and why people support PETA...

20090129074339AAeu1yu	Pets;Dogs	My dog's legs.......?	My dog seems to drag her back legs quite a bit... When she stands up and starts to walk, her back legs will drag for a moment before she actually uses them.. When I go to bed or sit on the couch and she climbs up with me, she seems to struggle a bit and only uses the front of her body to pull herself up.. She doesn't use her back legs to push herself up.       For a little bit, it wasn't *that* noticeable because when she stands up and her legs drag, it usually just looks like she's stretching but she does it all the time and I have my doubts about that being it... Same for climbing up on the bed and couch (neither of which are very high off of the ground at all).      I'm taking her to the vet on the 6th for her shots and I'll ask about it then... But in the meantime, I'm wondering if anyone on here has any idea what it might be.

I'm going to India for 14 weeks and can either leave my cat in my flat and get people to feed and care for him everyday or my friend has said he can stay at hers and she will look after him.  She has a cat of her own who my cat is familiar with as she used to live downstairs and her cat used to come in mine and mine used to go in hers and hers used to sleep at mine sometimes.  Her cat is out most of the time but she will keep mine in.  She will be there most of the time so he will have company.      Do you think he will be ok with this?  I am so worried about him.  He pulls his fur out sometimes but the vet said it could be bordom, stress or an allergy but that they dont know which.  They just give him a jab every so often to stop him doing it which works for a few months before he starts again.        Which would be best?  These are the only 2 options.  No one can stay at mine with him.

So, I'm going to give a list things that my mom wants in a dog, so that perhaps someone could point out some breeds that would fit the bill.      -Short hair   -Relatively friendly   -Small in size   -Doesn't look like an old lady (like a pug...although I think it's kinda cute)   -Relatively easy to train      And here are some things she definitely dislikes in a dog:      -Weak bladder   -Weak stomach   -Relatively mean   -Slobbers uncontrollably      Oh, and please don't recommend a Chihuahua. We've had one before, and she didn't like it very much.   Thanks.

20090129074505AABKq0h	Pets;Cats	A Problem with my Cats leg Amputation?	I just adopted a cat from the shelter that had had to have her front leg remove. When I took her to the vet for a check up before bringing her home they told me her amputation wasn't done correctly. I guess they did not take the leg off high enough and now she has like a stump. They told me about the health problems that this can cause. Should or could they even just go back in and take that part off? What is the odds of having complications if the stub part is left
20090129072227AALaJGD	Pets;Rodents	Unexpected Baby Guinea Pig, Please Help!?	Help! One of my Guinea pigs has just given birth! The cage has only Girls in it so I don't know how that happened. But anyway, Its really tinny. I don't know what to do! What if it isn't feeding? How can I tell if its too cold? The cage has 2 Mummy Pig and a child of each of them in there. Are they all okay to be with the little one? (Considering I don't know which of the 4 is the Mummy Pig to the new Pig)   What happens if there are more of them? Will the other female non-mummy Guinea pigs attack it?   What should I feed it? What if it is Ill? What if one of them is a boy? (Since I don't think Guinea pigs can have immaculate conception)   Any Info on baby Guinea pigs is greatly help-full, I am really worried.   The two older pigs are over 3 years old! Will they be hurt if it is them that has given birth?   Sorry I am rambling a bit and asking so many questions, but the new pig is so cute! and so unexpected... There has all ready been 3 litters, and I swear all the pigs in that cage are girls...
20090129072141AAPbXBN	Pets;Cats	At my wits end with cat urine?	My husband and I have this cat which gets allergies during the winter which makes her get scabs, puke, and poop on the floor.  Well, we went down and got her shot to help with the allergies and that helped perfectly last year.  Now she is peeing all over my floor underneath my dinning room table on carpet and I have been scrubbing, carpet shampooing and bought everything on the market to get rid of the smell and nothing is working!  She is still doing it and it still smells, I have an 8 month old son crawling around and it breaks my heart thinking hes breathing it in.  I don't let him near the spots but you still can smell it.  My husband wants to give her to the humane society or somewhere and I don't want to give up on her because I know it has to be something out there.  She has another vet appt. on Monday, but its 10:19 am and I have already cleaned the floor 3 times.  I don't know what to do :(  Can someone give me any suggestions until I find out more at her appt.?

20090129072223AAtZ5Bw	Pets;Dogs	Why is my chihuahua puppy to young to go outside?	another question about Cyc.     Ok when i went to the vet to get the replacement milk for Cyc the vet told me that as he is having to be hand raised i should socialise him as much as possible while he was young, as he will be missing out on things his mother would of taught him.    So for the last few days ive been taking him to the town and the park where lots of people walk there dogs so that he can meet as many people and dogs as possible. I got asked about his eye a lot, but one lady asked how old he was, i told her he was almost 5 weeks and she said that her was to young to be going outside.    Why is he to young? i don't understand i was told to take him out while he is young, or have i misunderstood the vet?     I made him a little jumper so he doesn't get cold and if its windy or raining i didn't take him out.     Ive decided not to take him out until i find out if this is true, when he can go out and why, as i don't want to risk doing anything that would be bad for him

20090129074424AAm0At4	Pets;Dogs	Yorkie keeps attacking Pit-bull! need help!?	Ok. I need help, ive already ask a question like this but now everything has change.   My Yorkie (Toby) is all most a year old we got him because my miniature pincher (Paris) who was about 4 years old got hit by a car.   Then a couple months later our Chocolate lab (Arnie) who was about 7 to 8 years old had to be put down because he had some kind of disease.   About 2 months later we got another dog Pit-Bull (Dallas) he is about 6 months old when we got him so his just a little bigger then Toby. For some reason our Yorkie keeps attacking our Pit-bull and won't let go of him. This happens sometimes over food, a toy, or if Dallas walks by my room and if Dallas is around me or mom.   My family and I don't know what to do...my mom wants to get rid of Toby but i don't want to, i want to hire a professional to teach Toby right from wrong. Our family even watches dog training shows like   Its Me Or The Dog   and   Cesar Millan    and we tried doing the Shhh thing...didnt work...saying No....didnt work.   Me and my mom usally go up to the dogs and try to pull them apart and soon or later one of us, mostly me gets bit by one of the dogs    Can anyone help me?   Should we use a cage or muzzle on Toby?   Should we hire a professional? (we really don't have the money for a professional)

20090129080057AAraHgc	Pets;Dogs	How do I start to housebreak my 8 week old Chihuahua?	I have a little male chihuahua that I've decided to keep. He's just about 8 weeks and pees/poops EVERYWHERE.    I've heard that chihuahuas are especially hard to train and housebreak.    It doesn't help that my particular chihuahua is a brat too.    I've gotten him a small kennel and some toys.    I've been keeping him in the kennel only at night, with newspaper in the bottom. I was hoping he would cry when he needed to gp to the bathroom BEFORE he made a mess in the kennel, but instead, he doesn't cry and just goes.    I also let him play pretty much all day outside, so I know he is going to the bathroom a number of times outside.    Is this messing with his learning or confusing him in any way?    I feel bad putting him in the kennel when he isn't tired...      Anyway, I was hoping someone could give me advice on a schedule to keep or give me some tips about this.   Thank you!
20090129081452AAivIJz	Pets;Dogs	What places are OK to bring your dog?	I know you can't bring your dog into a place that says "no Dogs" and everything. And definitely not into restaurants. But what are some places (besides a dog park or outside places) that are fine to bring your dog along to?      I have a small dog that will grow up to be small as well, so I'm not talking about strolling in with my huge dog on a leash.   I'm concerned about this because I don't want to leave him alone and I sometimes have a lot of errands to run during the day.    Thanks!

20090129080307AAlnU7s	Pets;Dogs	Dog with red sore spots that turn into scabs?	My 1.5 year old lab has red sore spots that turn into scabs on his belly. He has had them for a while, but they never seemed serious or a problem. He had skin issues about a year ago when he was just a puppy. I put him on premium food and it went away, but he has always been a bit itchy I believe, and it is not fleas. I'm wondering if it's allergies or if it's serious that I need to go to the vet. Last time I took him to the vet she acted like I was stupid because I brought him in because he was itching a lot. She had asked me if I ever owned a dog, which I have when living with my parents. I'm a 21 year old college student and this is my first dog that is mine and I make all the decisions for. So I want to know if this is serious enough to go to the vet.
