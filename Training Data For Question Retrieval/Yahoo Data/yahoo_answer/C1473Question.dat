I see a lot of accusations from one race to another about racism, how widespread it is, and the strange thing is, of all the people from every race I've ever met in my whole life, I've only known a handful of racists, and they were all from different races. The only ones that were spewing hate that I've ever seen were Media icons or weird cult leaders, TELLING everyone what to believe and think.

20090219205445AAt4xSt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can christians give a NON-RELIGIOUS reason against allowing gay marriage?	You cannot say that homosexuality is against nature since it occurs in the animal kingdom. You cannot say it is a sin, that implies religion.  You cannot say that marriage is for the purpose of making babies, if you say that then anyone who is infertile cannot be allowed to marry or anyone who doesn't want children. You cannot say that marriage is a religious ceremony, marriage is recognized by the government, even athiests get married.

20090219210658AAVufb3	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why follow the pagan faith?	If you asked a Christian, a Muslim, or a Jew this question:      "Why should I follow your faith?"       I would assume the answer would be:      Because there is only 1 God, and this is how you serve him.  If you do not serve God, you will be punished, if you serve God faithfully, you will be rewarded in the afterlife.         What is the pagan answer to this same question?

20090219210807AAhaIy8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Since the internet is the only remaining free media, are propagandists sent to lie and discourage people here?	Only the conspiracy theorists encourage true dialogue.  Others, who can't sleep when they're around, would then come and post insulting questions in single words as if emptying their entire IQs asking merely whether or not those who disagree with them have taken their meds.      It is clear that such postings wastes the time of the humans, but this doesn't stop the propagandists from doing it because they want the American people to be too busy to understand that the internet is the only place where real true information around all the conflicting theories can be found.      But since America adopted secret courts, secret trials, government snooping, concentration camps and torture like the communists and nazis always had (the conspiracy theorists can see this) how is it we do not have the "precious" gift of propagandists among us also?      When I was growing up here, not too long ago there was no such expression as conspiracy theorist.  In just the same way there was no such expression as, "Haven't you noticed it has been 6yrs since our last terror attack?"      Go through the search engine here in yahoo and enter the words "conspiracy theorist" and you would see there is a major obsession with labeling honest humans accordingly.  They don't tell anyone you don't have the freedom to believe a conspiracy exists like the American forefathers wrote the 2nd amendment in order to protect the American people from the government.      How can we calm down posters everywhere who laugh because humans fear no-fly-zones, but then swarm on forums to preoccupy themselves with an unknown terror group among us that never bothered America, and yet these same people chasing conspiracy theorists couldn't protect our country from the fear of no-fly-zones?      Any ideas?
20090219210031AAkhubY	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	So.. what do you think? nurture or nature?	Do you believe that people were born gay? like is it genes?      or do you think it's a choice..?       I personally think it's a preferance just like how people don't like peanuts because they got sick out of them.. or because they just simply never liked their taste.. your experience with them might form your preferance..    I'm sure any other straight person is capable of switching teams and fall in love...       ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE..   i've seen too many cases that proves to me that is not genetic.

20090219211137AAhOKHP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Any converts out there?	I was an evangelical christian for quite sometime, ironically enough it was a christian mission trip to India that made me completely question and ultimately abandon my christian faith. I think what did it was that I was put in a situation where 'god' could not be the easy answer. I was working with these orphans, and I was suddenly very uncomfortable telling them that all they needed to do was say a few words at the end of the day and their lives would get better. It suddenly occurred to me how offensive that was. These kids needed food, education, money, clothing and love not a book and a wish. The trip left me very bitter towards religion, but very hopeful in mankind. I was just curious to know if there were any christian-turned-atheists out there and how you got there...I guess I should also mention that I picked up Richard Dawkin's The God Delusion and that helped me a lot too.
20090219211723AAYe6WU	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Has anyone seen the HBO special 'Right America: Feeling Wronged' and, if so, how did you feel about it?	I think I actually lost a few brain cells watching this show. Certain far right Americans seem to be locked in their own little world. Many of them, when asked specific questions such as "how do you define socialism", didn't know what socialism was or how it was actually defined. One guy defined it as quote "Nazism". Are you kidding me? Nazis had a form of socialism, but socialism is not defined as nazism. I just wanted to reach through my TV and smack that guy for being a moron. Then, of course, You heard all these people talk about how America is the best nation in the world. Well, that is fine to believe that. I certainly have nothing against national pride. But, looking at these people you clearly can see that not one of them has ever been to any other country. So, how can they know the US is the best? A British gent might take offense to that if he has national pride and see's Great Britain as the best nation. People from the Netherlands might scoff at the American ego of "we're the land of the free" when they have the US beat on freedoms and liberties where a gay man can go to a smoke shop, buy some weed and smoke it, go to a gay whore house and buy a gentleman caller for the evening, and then marry his gentleman caller. They would argue that that makes America look like an uptight nation full of rules and limitations which certainly don't define America as a free nation but a reserved and progressive nation.      All I am saying is, the Americans featured in this documentary are so closed minded and sheltered in views that they have absolutely know idea about what they are talking about because the only thing they can see is what they want to have happen. They are the biggest sore losers and the ones who rub it in the most when they win. I lose brain cells just thinking about or trying to think about what it must take to be this obnoxious and self righteous.       What do you think?

So when I made my next purchase with my debit card I went negative. If Jack-in-the-Box hadn't charged me 3 times for that one order, I would have had enough money for the purchase that made my account go negative.

20090219213905AALJTwt	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Do you think its rude...?	i'm a cashier. today a woman came in with her three young girls (under5) who each bought a piece of candy-separately, plus the mom's order. she was teaching them how to make a purchase, but the store i work at sells primarily quite higher-end,  expensive items and candy purchases are ...bothersome at the least. the customer must be a member of the store, and in order to complete a transaction i need to perform a search to look up the name. it takes about 30 extra seconds. times 4, at a busy part of the day, this woman created quite a backup and made me look so bad (inefficient and slow).    do you think she should have taken into account the time of day and the rush that was going on and done just one transaction, saving the individual ones for say the grocery store express lane at 9am or an off-time? or am i just being too critical?

If you had to undergo the task of living in Utah and not being Mormon, you'd feel the same way.      But, I appreciate everyone's beliefs. I try my very best to be open minded. I've been judged too harshly because of my beliefs to turn around and do it to someone else.      There is one thing that I have never understood about the way many people think god works. I would love to hear some opinions.       If god is this all loving, forgiving, wonderful god... why is there such a strong belief in hell? From my point of view, it is backward to say that god forgives all, and jesus died for our sins... but if you screw up you spend eternity in a hot place that's run by a little red man.      I am not trying to be condescending to anyone's beliefs. I guess  I would just like some opinions. Whether you believe in god or not.      Speak freely...

20090219214506AAC9uXV	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Could this be the root of Americas social problems?	I would like to state first off that I am not an American and this is just an assumption.      From what I know it is quite clear to me that Americans are taught from an early age about personal independence. With famous American quotes like "Everyone is different in their own way" and "You are special(meaning different from everyone else)". Could that be the reason why there doesn't seem to be a type of "brotherhood" between countrymen?      In Canada we are taught about equality and unity as children and adults and develop a type of bond between our fellow countrymen even if we have never met before.      Could those two mindsets really be the cause of the vast social order differences on either side of the border?

20090219215500AAdHki8	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	In response to ?? about why the gvt 'still gives out handouts' to first nation and black people?	I am a fan of free speech, when you spew your ignorant hatred I want to silence you long enough for you to get yourself educated. Maybe talk to families who have been torn apart by genocide, people missing the traditional structure of their family units.      What exactly is ever okay about one group of people over powering another through violence and genocide just to take land, money and have power over. People may say it’s human nature but I suspect it’s basic animal instinct at best. Throughout time, lands; villages; people have been taken by hostile force. These actions often justified by those who hold the power when the blood shed has quieted.       When countries are colonized generations are affected, people, entire families and cities are often wiped out/murdered (eg small pox/blankets; residential schools; slavery). I don’t understand how you cannot see the influence of current laws and historical events have on people alive today.      Also I am very curious about all this free EVERYTHING??? Please explain what is free and who are these lucky folks? Where are they? I am curious b/c where I live I see that pretty much everyone has the same crap/same great opportunities that n. America provides to EVERYONE, except maybe there is a lot of white privilege that goes on. You know how some white people get FREE ‘respect’ and automatic privilege that is not necessarily earned or even acknowledged? Have you read anything about immigration law? Are you aware how difficult it is to move to places in n. America and have legitimate credentials recognized? Do you ever question why so many colonizers and descendants bash potential immigrants yet have forced themselves on Nations of people and did not respect the structure of the culture or languages of existing people.       I think it would be great if you took some university courses or found another way to recognize your ethnocentric views, you know, expand ignorance allow for knowledge.

20090219221013AAy9rXW	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Are blacks proud to be black or Native American. ?	Ok is it just me . I reconize that many blacks now days claim to have native american in them . I mean many probally do and blacks are not the only ones   saying they have it in them whites quickly claim native american heritage too. But I am concern about my people . It just seem like now days  we are trying to be something else to fit in or I guess to make us look better . I mean my grandmother is pacific islander , my mother is mixed her father is black  and my dad is black . But I  do  not go around saying I am black and by the way  have some pacific islander in me and my great great grandfather is natie american . I mean I was not raised that way ,I am proud who I am . It just get on my nerves sometimes when  I hear a conversation or look myspace web pages and see  black people  saying I am black who and native American my great great is this and that . In all reality  many native American tribes will get upset if they  found out  blacks are claiming them .As a matter of fact the Cherokee Indians  are disowning black indian tribes; because they are getting richer now ; as a result there is a big law suit going . So yes blacks have native american blood in them  a lot of us do .  But  sometimes it seem like we just claim it to be different   or feel like we would get excepted into society more .  I just dont know ,  So do ya feel that we fake sometimes of claiming native american heritage to fit in more .  I tired of hearing  my great  great  is native american ; your black  so stop . Maybe I was raised different but I was raised to be proud of who I am.  So why do you think we do this . ??????

20090219221527AA3T7a2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do so much people claim to be Christian?	Jesus says that disciples are the ones who love and obey him.

Give to the poor.   Destroy the things that tempt you to do evil.   You don't get into heaven for being a good person , you get there for being a Christian.       I ask you people , why do you claim to be Christians , when you disobey his only commandments?   How can you be a non-practicing Christian.   if you don't practice Christianity , then you are not a Christian.   you don't have to go to church. Jesus says that he will reward you openly even if you worship in secret.   Please ask for forgiveness in Jesus name now.   I promise you that you will get into heaven if you are a Christian.

(I'm sorry for my english, i'm not a native speaker)...   I've been living in Sydney (AU) for 9 months, along this time i've been sharing my room with a guy from London, he's really handsome (i like him), but he claims to be straight, He knows i'm bi and I have notices some behaviour that drive me crazy.... here are them....      1. He is serious, always speaks about girls, but not in a dirty way like other guys.   2. Many times, after I take a shower, I take my towel off and he looks straigth at my package, and just when he realizes  i'm looking at him, he turns his eyes to other place or my face (quite often), but always trying to look again to there.   3. A couple of times when he's close to me... I've seen how his package turns on.   4. When he looks at my eyes (usually playing and challenging), he can't keep them on mine, overrall if I start to move my lips like telling him KISS ME BABE....   5. I haven't met a girfriend of him      but there are more....      When he speaks about gay or bi ppl, he says he doesn't like them (actually he says i'm the exception to the rule).       I'd like to know if it would be prudent to proceed to talk or try to kiss him in one of the situations before mentioned...      Thanks.

Im wondering if atheism is opposite of religion, or rather opposite of creationism. In other words, can you be an atheist, and still be a creationist?      I am definitely an atheist. I don't believe in talking snakes, 994 year old men, a talking burning bush, a man who lived inside of a big fish for 3 days, nor an invisible man up in the sky. I respect the bible for the hope and security it ensues, but just don't personally believe the far fetched extravagances and exaggerations.      However, I am unsure if i believe in creationism. If something did create us, (cliche alert) I think its something WAY beyond our understanding....      Anyways... is atheism opposite of religion, or rather opposite of creationism?

20070701170952AArGxlu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Est-ce que c'est un miracle ? Sinon pourquoi ? Est-ce qu'on le savait avant le Coran ?	Dans un verset, nous apprenons que les montagnes ne sont pas immobiles comme elles semblent l'être, mais sont constamment en mouvement.      Et tu verras les montagnes, que tu croyais figées, passer comme des nuages. (Coran, 27 : 88)      Ce déplacement des montagnes est causé par le mouvement de l'écorce terrestre sur laquelle elles sont fixées. L'écorce terrestre flotte en quelque sorte sur le manteau, qui est plus dense. C'est au début du 20ème siècle que, pour la première fois, un savant allemand du nom d'Alfred Wegener a avancé l'hypothèse que les continents formaient initialement un seul bloc, puis dérivèrent sur différentes directions et s'écartèrent les uns des autres.       Ce n'est que dans les années 1980, 50 ans après la mort de Wegener, que les géologues ont compris qu'il avait raison. Comme Wegener l'avait indiqué dans un article rédigé en 1915, les continents étaient liés 500 millions d'années auparavant : la large masse continentale, appelée Pangée, était située au P?le Sud.

20080412095502AAjPfh7	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	To those 'Free Tibet' Olympic protestor - How much do you really know about Tibet, its history and the people?	Have any of you ever been in Tibet? Have any of you really read the history about Tibet, before and after Chinese ruling?      I've been to Tibet in 1998, I myself am NOT a fan of Chinese Gov, nor a free-tibet activists. But I've witnessed myself how Tibet was built by the Chinese, the roads, facilities, markets, how Chinese helped tibet people having a normal lives.      I can tell you that those lama temples and palaces, they were built by gold, gemstones, and countless treasures were stored inside them, and yet those Tibet people were living out below the proverty line with empty stomach while those lamas were having most of the people's resources inside their grand palaces.      I feel great about Chinese entering Tibet and kicked out those lamas, at least people there would start having a regular life, with food and full stomach. Those lamas may be their spirit leaders, but surely at the same time they draw most of people's money and left them hungry outside   .   Wake up people.

20090219181603AA33jQ6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I'm curious as to why atheist belief is considered arrogant?	I'm not talking about atheists themselves. Arrogant people come in all categories.      But I think I remember Rick Warren saying in an interview that it was "arrogant to believe we could do it all on our own".      I think the belief that a god made us in his image is arrogant.    That we are promised a reward when we die or that only those who believe in him are saved is even a bit arrogant, because  why should some people be chosen over others based on their belief system? It is almost like sibling rivalry.      Atheists pretty much believe that this is it. When you die it is over. We tend to see ourselves as just another piece of the puzzle that is the universe. Why is that perceived as arrogant?

20081103045652AAfQH2h	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How does a Christian overcome temptation? By thinking about the crucifixion or by increasing the light?	Light overcomes the darkness, so....      Is this the reason Christians have such a hard time with temptation? They are taught from childhood to think about the crucifixion, rather than to increase the light.      I raise this question because the Gospel Jesus himself was preaching was about becoming "Children of the Light," (John 12:36)...  Click on my avatar for a resource and more complete confirmation.      Should it be surprising that ignoring the Gospel of Light Jesus preached would lead to difficulties in resisting temptation?      So if we want to overcome temptation, which sounds best to you... listen to Paul and think about the the Crucifixion, or listen to Jesus and increase the light?

Are there a bunch of copies of Jesus? What exactly does it mean to "be with Jesus." Does Jesus stand up on a stage and talk to all the millions upon millions of Christians?

Don't pray or think of god really all that much, only when it comes up in conversation. Is it just me, or are these people just atheists, who have not questioned their beliefs yet, so don't really know that they are atheist?

My dad is certainly one of them, he has no logical thinking processes and he's unable to see reason, understand it nor accept it. I think these kind of people are stuck.       Do you know what I mean??? Popular examples of these kind of people are probably Ann Coulter and Shirley Phelps.. Does anyone remember the fatty on Flavor Flave 1 that failed every lie detector test?

If you accept my challenge, please email me in a month and tell me of your accomplishment.       Not only are the messages on tv getting everyone to conform into the same way of thinking, the way they want you to think. But through modern technology there is a lot more to it. Have you even wondered for a second why the government has spent billions on giving you a better television picture through the digital switch? At least 200 million tv's needed the converter box. They gladly gave away $40 vouchers for anyone that needed it. 40X200 million, not to mention all of the media advertising about the swith. You do the math, they must really want you to watch tv.

20090219185809AAPILfQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you believe our dearly loved departed contact us in dreams?	A couple weeks ago I had a dream about my father who passed thru to the other side over 2 years ago. In it, I was at my paternal grandmother's who was an amazing Southern cook and making Thanksgiving dinner. I cried when I saw my father and knew he was not alive and told him how much I loved him.  His sister, my aunt was also at dinner and she too passed over last year although I was not aware of it in my dream.  Nor did I realize in the dream that my dear loving wonderful grandmother is also now deceased.  She was so full of life and silly childlike humor and ways, making a superlative meal that could have fed a platoon and brought together a fractured and fractious family. My grandmother was the glue that kept us all together and was the unsung hero of the family.  I laugh when I think of the times she did get frazzled, lose her cool and say in Southern inflection, "why hells bells!"  She made even anger seem endearing in her childlike innocence.  She was the unflappable trooper who soldiered on expecting no reward for her service.  Raised a Baptist, she was to my mind a true Christian although she never went to Church.  I cried when I woke up from the dream to realize they were all beyond the rainbow but they were tears of joyful remembrance and I do believe they broke thru to spend an evening with me and I cherish that.      Do you have believe the dead break thru in dreams to reach us?  Do you have any dream time stories of remembrance to share?

20090219165210AA8GWb2	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	I had a ghost problem last night?	I work in a very old building on the overnight shift. Our office is in the basement, and so you have to climb two flights of stairs to get to the ground level. Early this morning around 1 am, I was going up the stairs to check the schedule for a co-worker and to my surprise, sitting on the landing was a 2-4 year old girl! I about screamed when I saw her! She was wearing late 1800's to early 1900's attire and was leaning against the wall sitting down with something in her lap that she was looking down at. She never looked at me and only lasted a split second until I realized what the heck it even was! So would this be a good ghost or a bad ghost? I had the eeriest feeling ever when I saw her and now I can't get her out of my head, I keep thinking about her. How would I even find out who she even is? What do I do if I see her again? Could I have been "open" to something that caused me to see her? Sorry too many questions, but I'm really curious here...

Or is it just guys who are insecure about their sexuality? Do you think that most straight guys would want to prove their masculinity or gay guys who are in denial and/or in the closet? The reason I'm asking is that there's this guy in my chorus class who barely sets off my gaydar, but whenever we have to move stuff from the stage or whatever he always tries to carry the heaviest things and do the most work w/out complaining. And when we put our chorus books away (we usually just give them to someone in our section) he always tries to get the most books he can hold and puts them away. But he's not show-offy or anything and doesn't brag and stuff. He's kinda quiet, but not shy. He's definitely not as obnoxious as the other guys in that class, but most of them make fun of him for whatever reason. He's not stereotypically gay at all, either. What do you think? Is he gay? Do straight or gay guys tend to feel the need to prove how manly they are?

Even in the dream of that fading day,   even the dusty figure of the future,   because you were always there looking on    even on the most fragile days   even on the road which only detours   I'm getting over it, and am able to exist here even now.      Just what am I lifting, I wonder?   Just what couldn't I lift, I wonder?   Although ever since then I've tried questioning myself,   No matter how many times the door to my heart is knocked on   Even if deep inside my chest my heartstrings are pulled out to look at   all that will come out will only be pleasant memories of fun..   It's simply that, I have always loved you.   That's all, although it's just that,   that was all that was in me.    And even now, I love you unchangingly.      There was a day when in the pretty starry night sky   we lined up to make our wishes    although those wishes have already been forgotten   it would be good if this moment could continue   and we remembered only all the things we thought about.   Now if you think about it, making that wish was good wasn't it?   However, it seems that God isn't here.   At the moment you became a star, I made a vow.   I do not need a God.   You over there, if only you had stayed.      Even today, the town without you   was as its usual rushing, restless self.    It was quite like doing nothing, coming to an end.   With the months and years that trot past   and in the middle of the softly moving seasons,   suddenly I think of going to look up at the night sky.   And then, I quietly made a wish.    A wish upon you who became a star.    "It's alright now, because I can stand by myself."   But then hey, it's because I'm not alone right?   That's right, I'm living your share too.    You also, have always been living inside me.    That's why, again just like that time   Always be by my side to watch over me      When I wish upon you,   When I wish upon you         Please tell me if my translations are correct ;]    Thank you.       PS the song is Kimi Ni Negai Wo by Miyavi

If you abort a fetus, it is not a person. It is still part of your body! That's like saying no one is allowed to get plastic surgery because it's cutting chunks from your body that could've been cloned to make more people. Also, consider the mother and child. They could very well die and suffer more from childbirth or being too poor and dying cold and hungry. Don't you think people should be able to make their own choice according to their own person? How is it anyone's business what was growing in you that you would not be able to love if you completed it?   It makes me angry when people say that the only option is to suffer through childbirth and raising a child as a teen or a poor person.

Well first, most people think the Earth was created by some ''big bang'', but if you think about it explosions can't just happen out of no where unless something caused it. So doesn't that mean that there's something with a greater mind a something that can think that could create what we have today? Also, why would our universe be set up in such a complex, but perfect way for us to live? This can only mean that someone with a very smart mind could have done this. No explosion could cause such a well thought out universe.      The reason why some of you people don't believe in God is because God gave us a choice to believe in him or not. So all you people out there who don't believe. I know I'm going to heaven because I accepted Jesus as my lord and savior. You can to if you say this prayer," Lord God I'm a sinner and I have done wrong. Please forgive me for all the bad things that I've done and please come into my life.

Nancy Polosi and others a good example of a "modern pro-choice catholic" ?      Does the Pope really have that little real authority or influence over his supposed flock ?

20090219182216AAWS98F	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Catholics, can you please tell me what Vatican II is?	What are some of the main changes it made?      Here is an answer to one of my questions I read, which stated the following:      "The Catholic Church has solemnly defined three times by infallible declarations that outside the Catholic Church there is no salvation. The most explicit and forceful of the three came from Pope Eugene IV, in the Bull Cantate Domino, 1441, who proclaimed ex cathedra: "The Most Holy Roman Church firmly believes, professes and preaches that none of those existing outside the Catholic Church, not only pagans, also Jews, heretics, and schismatics can ever be partakers of eternal life, but that they are to go into the eternal fire 'which was prepared for the devil and his angels' (Mt. 25:41) unless before death they are joined with Her... No one, let his almsgiving be as great as it may, no one, even if he pour out his blood for the Name of Christ can be saved unless they abide within the bosom and unity of the Catholic Church."      the post Vatican II church (which is absolutely heretical and not Catholic) changed the dogma to extra ecclesium ine salus. Now a dogma is infallible. It cannot be changed or altered by any pope or council. It is heresy for them to change it to without the church there is no salvation. The post Vatican II church says that jews, heretics, pagans can all go to heaven. This is blatant heresy."      Is that true? Does that mean every single non-Catholic is going to hell, no matter what? I'm not assuming that is the case, but I am very curious. I wouldn't want to see the majority of the world's population end up in eternal torment.      Thank you for your help and God Bless.

So far Ive been able to get jews to admit they r chosen and even that they feel superior to every1 else. (despite some opposition) My studies have led me several passages in their texts as well as christian texts that point out jews as being the first of many and as light to the masses. So, if they weren't chosen to do God's work, what were they chosen to do? drive up the prices of diamonds in a sick monopoly? then call us all idiots for falling for it? stunts like that r what got hitler's attention to begin with. It seems to me that there is a lot of secrets being kept by both jews and muslims alike. im starting to wonder which is the worst of the 2.

20090219183311AAkRL2n	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Straight Guy, Bi Guy.....?	Okay there's this guy who works in the mall and I really like him and I think he likes me also but I would like if someone could help me figure out somethings about him:      1. Whenever I go to the mall to see him we always have good conversation about different things.   2. He walked close up on me a few times and tried to play it off but I knew what he was trying to do.   3. I caught him taking a glance at my butt a couple of times.   4. Every time I talk with him he always would smile and stare me in the eyes like he's interested in me.   5. Like 2 times whenever I would see him he shook my hands 3 TIMES, once was when I said I had to go, then I stayed a couple of minutes then said I had to go again and we shook hands again, and last but not least he told to MEET HIM AGAIN THE NEXT DAY and we shook hands again. Now come on now what straight guy would shake another guy's hand that much in under 5 minutes?   6. Now this is a very major one. On Valentines Day that just passed I went there to see him again and I know he was happy cause I could see it in his eyes. So we got to talking and stuff and then at 6:00 p.m. he left his register to clock out and I was happy because we could be close by each other. So after he clocked out he asked what I was doing tonight (ON VALENTINES DAY NEED I REMIND YOU) and I said probably go to a parade (We live in Louisiana), so he said oh ok. Then It happen.....      ....Before he was about to leave two things happened he shook my hands and came up on me like he was going to hug me, and yes I was shocked.      Then before he left I said, " Well hey let me give you my number", and he said YES (YAYYYYY). So after I said that he said, "Well let me give you my number instead", probably wanted to feel like the dominant one. So we exchanged numbers and then that was a wrap I was so happy that night, did I say it was on Valentine's Day?      So let me know what you think about him is he into me or what.      Oh yeah before I forget when I went the other day him and another coworker (a girl) cam by us and told me hey and I said hey then he said, " Yeah thats my friend that goes to so and so high school", and thats when I knew he liked me.      Oh yeah I called a couple of times but I never know what to talk about we are both seniors in High School he's 19 and I turn 18 on Feb. 25.

20090219190716AAJ8Ijr	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What religion is this, exactly? (possibly Wicca and Christian?)?	I've been struggling to find ANYONE who agrees with my views on religion, and am now even at a loss for the name of it.       Originally, I was fully Christian. Then, I realized that most Christians don't believe in reincarnation. Okay, so just a different type of Christian, maybe? I shrugged it off, but then realized my beliefs were even more different-- I believe we're all connected through energy, that nature has its own magic, that spells work and should only be used for good, I believe in the threefold law, and all that. When I told a friend, he said that it sounded like I was Wiccan, which I didn't know what was at the time. So, after researching, I realized that I believe almost everything Wiccan. Sadly, though.... I couldn't totally classify myself as that, either, though. I also believe in Jesus Christ... But I do think that there is a one, single god, who has both male and female aspects that can be worshiped at the same time.      So I'm really kind of stuck here, not fitting into either category, and not knowing anyone who shares my beliefs. I tried looking for some wiccans to talk to so I could learn more about their beliefs than what was written in the books I read, but I live in a place where no one even knows what Wicca is, never mind practicing it.      So could any of you help me, please, by either telling me what religion I am, by talking with me about wicca and teaching me, or by agreeing with my views? Thank you very much.

Who claims to be our Healer?      God says, “I am the Lord who heals you.”  Exodus 15:26      “I will take away sickness from among you. . .”  Exodus 23:25,26      “He forgives all my sins and heals ALL my Diseases.”  Psalm 103:3      “I will give you back your health again and heal your wounds.”  Jeremiah 30:17      “The Lord will remove from you all sickness. . .”  Deuteronomy 7:15      “My counsel shall stand, and I WILL do ALL my pleasure.:  Isaiah 46:10      “Yes, I have spoken it.  I will also bring it to Pass.  I have purposed it.  I will also do it.”  Isaiah 46:11      “God cannot lie.”  Titus 1:2      “I am the Lord: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass.  Ezekiel 12:25      When Jesus was on earth, He NEVER referred anyone to a Physician      God needs no middle men.  When Jesus was on earth, when someone came to Him for healing, He never referred the person to Luke, the “Physician.”  Jesus healed the person directly and personally.  And He healed him either with His Word – which we have today, in the form of the Bible – or He healed him with natural methods – clay, water, etc.

It went like this:      "Does Satan exist and if he does where is he?   I have heard that you can see the grace of God in the kindness of others and in the beauty of the world. But what about Satan? Does Satan exist? If there is a Good supernatural force in the world, can there also be a Bad supernatural force? Some religions believe in God being both good and evil. In Western culture we have God and Satan. Is Satan a myth? Does Satan exist? Where does he exist? How does he show himself to us? How do we protect ourselves from his temptations and his cursed actions?"   --------------      That's A LOT of stuff to have to think and worry about every day!  Plus praying and washing and making the sign of the cross and saying prayers when the sun rises and when it sets, and going to church, and reading that book over and over and over.  Then there's thinking about everything you do or say - is it a sin?  Is god or allah watching and writing everything you do down? What did you do wrong today and can you fix it so you won't have to go to hell? What if you forgot something!      And then, the alternative ........................ pure, quiet peace of mind.       Pure, restful, uncluttered peace of mind where you never have to clog your daily thoughts with all this god mumbo jumbo. Can you imagine how blissful it would be to think about life and purpose, only when you want to? Can you imagine being good for the sake of the good feeling you get, instead of doing it because a book tells you you'd BETTER do it or you'll be damned!      Do religious people ever wish they could just take a rest from their religion, just for a while?

20090219202230AAZ2h7t	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	"You cannot love something you do not understand."?	"You cannot love something you do not understand." That is so true. Especially in the case of Islam. I understand Islam 99% more than most Americans. So I love it. The only ones who hate Islam are people who do not understand it. Whatever they know about Islam and Muslims comes from either the T.V. or Anti-Islamic sites.      Some key facts:   1. Muslims greet each other by assalaumualekum, which means peace be upon you. This greeting can be used on non-Muslims too.       2. You can't judge Islam on the very few radical terrorists. That's the equal to judging Catholics on what Hitler did or judging Christianity by the KKK. Very few Muslims are terrorists. There are 1.6billion Muslims. If there are 52 Muslim Terrorist attacks in 1 year. That's less then 0.01%. Way less.          If you're only knowledge of Islam comes from the T.V. and Anti-Islamic sites, don't even bother posting. And please don't give some lie about how you read the Qu'ran and it was "full of hate."

20090219212041AA72VB8	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	To everyone  , to black , white , green or purple ; should a man hit a woman?	This is not really a question nor  comment but my true opinion. I  am making my judgement from past incidents and newly hollywood incident between Rihanna and Cris Brown. Many people say that Rihanna  is not a sweet angel and that she is truly jealous female . As a matter of fact she has a tendencey to hit men. However I am not saying this is what happen in her case but I truly believe she is not 100%innocent. Regardless of who hit who its a shame of that  got that crazy/ However , not just Cris Brown but other ordinary men that I know   treated unfairly in domestic violent cases because they are the men . Many times what I witness the female provoke , or even  aggressively attack the ma n like she was a man. So what if  a female provokes , or aggressively attack her husband or boyfriend should he just stand their and get his butt whoop . Or should he protect himself?In my opinion if a women has the balls enough to step to a man like she's big and bad and lay hands on him like she is a dude .I feel that female should be knock out  like a dude by the dude. Or if a female tries to provoke a fight  with a guy  I feel that guy should put her in her place not by hitting her; unless she hits him; but by putting her in her place. I just feel that there is a line to draw , and many times females know that the justice system is 90%  of the time on their side  when it comes to domestic violence regardless  if  she  is the one who provoke or attack the dude. I just feel in certain circumstances a men can not when or lose when it comes to the justice system especially in domestic violent case .  To many times   I have seen both ends of the specturm . I have seen  a  controlling , scary abusive man who earns his rights to go to prison. However ,I have seen  females putting their hands on  real man who tries his best not to hurt the girl  but sometimes he just have to defend himself  . So do ya think iits ok for a man to put his hand on a woman when provoke or  defindeing himself ?

20090219193537AAdaJGf	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians: What is your favorite story/verse/psalm from the Bible?	Mine is the Parable of Sower and Soils in Mark 4:8      Parable of the Sower and Soils      1 He began to teach again by the sea. And such a very large crowd gathered to Him that He got into a boat in the sea and sat down; and the whole crowd was by the sea on the land. 2 And He was teaching them many things in parables, and was saying to them in His teaching, 3 “Listen to this! Behold, the sower went out to sow; 4 as he was sowing, some seed fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate it up. 5 “Other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of soil. 6 “And after the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. 7 “Other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and it yielded no crop. 8 “Other seeds fell into the good soil, and as they grew up and increased, they yielded a crop and produced thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold.” 9 And He was saying, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”    10 As soon as He was alone, His followers, along with the twelve, began asking Him about the parables. 11 And He was saying to them, “To you has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God, but those who are outside get everything in parables, 12 so that WHILE SEEING, THEY MAY SEE AND NOT PERCEIVE, AND WHILE HEARING, THEY MAY HEAR AND NOT UNDERSTAND, OTHERWISE THEY MIGHT RETURN AND BE FORGIVEN.”

20090219194710AAeL0Av	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you ever see the world uniting under one banner apart from a religious one?	I am talking about Star trek type of unity amongst all men and women across the world.  If you are not familiar with Start trek, there is only one 'country' or 'federation' under which all humans are governed.  Is this type of similar scenario possible in the real world? It has come close to occurring in the past; but under religious banners; mainly Christianity and Islam.  I am not pushing any agenda here, you can look it up on wikipedia to discover the extent those two religions dominated the world in the past.  In my opinion, those were the closest any ideology has ever come to uniting people under a single banner.  For all the noise that atheists make they represent 2.3% of the world's population (wikipedia quote).  Islam itself has 1.8 billion followers and Christianity has somewhere around 1.5 to 2.1 billion followers.  Statistically speaking, it is more plausible that one of these two banners may unite people more than any other government or ideology that exists today. Lemme know what you all think...

20090203110037AA16ZKT	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Will there be more gay m/m romance in the rest of The Last Herald series?	The Last Herald is a novel series by the author Mercedes Lackey.  The first book, "Magic's Pawn," had a gay romance.  I want to know if the other books in the series will also.        ---        SPOILERS      ----      The m/m courtship in the first book ends in tragedy.  The lead protagonist is bisexual leaning more toward homosexual.  His gayness is a central theme in the novels.  But I want to know if he ever has another romance like he did in the first novel?  As far as the story goes his first romance was his soulmate and he can never again love another.  I am not sure if the series will be worth reading if the rest of the novels are only him dealing with loneliness and blasting stuff with his wizard powers.  I want to see him get some.  So does he?

He disappeared and then he came back looked at me and looked kind of withdrawn and turned around walking away. I was drawn to him and I started walking home which was in the same direction he was going and then he started talking to me knowing I was right behind him. He told me he was a vampire. I woke up startled.    First off, I have not watched Twilight and any vampire movies lately and am not a teenager.

20090219213116AALGAvY	Society & Culture;Languages	An additional grammar problem. Help?	I am a member of an internet forum. Some time in the forum, there was a member who quoted a sentence that contained the phrase "an additional five items". I replied to that post with "Shouldn't it be 'five additional items'?" Other members of the forums instead told me that "an additional five items" is a valid grammar despite my protests. So I randomly tried typing both phrases "X additional things" and "an additional X things" in Google, and found that both grammar styles were used.      My question: Which one is actually the correct grammar, and if it happens that both are right, why? I do suspect that "an additional five items" is used as an abbreviation of "an additional group of five items", but is that the case here?

20090219221112AAda0QN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, do you agree God has the special right to kill us because he is God?	People attack the Bible by saying that God wasn't right in killing all those babies in Egypt because the Pharoah wouldn't listen to him. In reality, this is morally justified for a few reasons:      1) The babies will be in Heaven forever   2) God created us and has a right to take us out of this world   3) The babies he killed felt no pain   4) God provided a way to avoid having your baby killed by him. They could have put blood on their doors but they didn't. The Bible documents that the Jews were able to get the word out across the country to everyone to do this.   5) God's ways cannot be compared to humans. God knows ALL the facts and we don't so it's not fair to judge him. We could not kill babies like he did, but we are NOT God. He has a seperate form of morality.      Do you agree?      I've seen atheists ask if a person hypothetically knew ALL the facts, would it be okay for a person to kill a bunch of babies in the SAME circumstance.       The answer is NO.      God put us into this world and he can take us out of it.      Imagine the world we live in is the first floor of a building and Heaven is the second floor. ALL God did was move the babies to the second floor a little earlier than usual.

They believe it was written by a human as a way to control other humans. This person does believe in a God, but is not sure about what this God wants from us. He believes in Angels and Demons, as well as Heaven and Hell. But he does not believe that this God created the earth and the people. He just sort of believes...that there is a higher power...I know it's hard to understand. Hmm what else...This person also believes in fate. That there is a higher power that has a path laid out for everyone.      So as you can tell, this persons beliefs are all over the place. What religion would they fall under? Or is it too scattered...? Thanks for the help. I hope to receive answers from people of different religions.

20090219222953AArlUeL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I need help understanding angels?	I'm wanting to become more in tune with God and angels. I know that Satan sometimes disguises himself as an angel of light. Will it always be true that if you see an angel, that it's really a demon? Also, I saw an Angel Oracle kit at a bookstore. I know that angels aren't supposed to be bad but is it bad to try to use an Oracle kit to communicate with angels? Can that make bad things happen.      If anyone can explain to me about the angel oracle kit, I would appreciate it.      Thank You    (Only serious answer please)

20090219222140AACM4VS	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Can some one please answer some of my questions on death?	Recently I lost my father in a freak accident and for someone who keeps to the them self it has been difficult to cope. I have so many regrets and feelings of guilt that pretty much eat me alive throughout the day and simple things trigger me into deep thinking. I have had a few questions that I don’t believe I asked because I have never been in a situation even minutely related to the loss of a loved one.      1. I’m confused about the whole grave thing, so do the dead awaken [those who were believers] and continue their existence in the grave ( like do they do salat and are they whole in shape)?   2. Can they see by any chance how their living loved ones are and while visiting the grave can they hear the dead?   3. Do people who die in fires automatically go to heaven?
