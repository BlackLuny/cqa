2Cw0DfaSaa	nothing. your friend is a drama queen.|`|NTUr0t3haa	No, it is not absolutely true. You can make a fairly accurate prediction of whether you're catching a cold and whether it will be worse the next day. I have done it many times. And it wasn't that I 'convinced' myself. In fact, I tried hard to prevent it but couldn't.    In any case, it doesn't work to scold and lecture a friend who says they fell ill. And it's worse to bring it up later and scold her again. It's not up to you how she responds to feeling ill. You have to accept it.|`|VCa9zIqwaa	you should have not teased her. yeah she should have think positive but you should have not teased her in the first place.you should kind of took care of her so she could feel well...|`|L0Hz227xaa	Well, your probably right, i mean if she kept a positive attitude you guys probably would have had more fun. BUT she didnt feel good, and when your sick, thats the worst time to be bothered. I am sure she did not mean to ruin the trip or be a lump on the log and complain, but put urself in her shoes. If your sick and planned to go on a trip, how would u feel? Everyone know that when ur come down with a cold, it has to get worse in order to get better. So she was giving you a heads up that she probably wont feel any better. So you probably pissed he off by still bringing it up and discusing it over lunh after the trip. I would apologize and tell her ur sorry. Tell her u understand and will be more empathetic. She will forgive u if she is ur real friend and move past.|`|9kRFGagaaa	you are right, no one can pre-determine what their symptoms WILL be, unless they are allergic to something and know how they will react to it. Any way... i think that what made her mad was that you didn't believe her, bringing it up after it happened sort of is like digging up the past. And from what you said you said it sounds like you gave her the impression that she was faking it. Im sure she wanted to have fun with you on her trip, and that she feels bad that she missed out, and bringing it up probably brought back the feelings of letting you down, and no one wants to let a friend down. try to explain where you were coming from, and if you really thought she was faking than pretend like you dont. i hope this helps you :)|`|XNKnHt8Xaa	You are not missing anything.She's the party-pooper and you just said the truth.And I agree with you about "I'm getting a cold" part.Is she psychic or something?I guess you should apologize but also ask her how did she know she was going to get a cold.|`|8AdBxvWNaa	U were right in a way but I think friendship is complicated and may be she was hurt because u made fun of her being sick|`|GRPxWmBxaa	ur missing da fact dat ur friend is a bit dumb hu dosen't get jokes and also da snoby types hu prefers things according 2 their will. U didn't say n e thing but ur friend's mentality isn't dat broad so she took it otherwise. just ignore her 4 a couple of days then she herself will start talking 2 u.|`|pU97DEjNaa	well...it is true that if she stayed positive she would have felt better, but I think that you were a little insensitive towards her. No offense, but I think that you pushed it a bit with the jokes and that made her mad. I'm sure if you apologize to her and ask her how can you make it up to her she will feel better and forgive you!:D  Best Of Luck :)|`|DkwgogXZaa	eh...you probably need more empathy...|`|IPS3hWweaa	What are you missing? Sensitivity?    She wasn't feeling well and you just blew that off like it's impossible for her to not feel 100%. Next time YOU aren't feeling well, just try thinking happy thoughts and see how well that works!|`|3y0w1qIBaa	I think you made fun of her being sick is what causes this conflict.  To resolve this situation, apologize to her face to face and tell her that you will do anything to make her feel better and spend time with you.

6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	He's either excessively needy or manipulative.  Chances are he just wants you to keep saying it because it bolsters his ego.  You might ask him one day, point blank, why he's marrying you if he thinks you don't love him.  He really should explain his behavior, because a lifetime together with him saying he doubts your devotion is going to become emotionally draining and may become a self-fulfilling prophecy.|`|S8RL9lieaa	Insecure and immature are only two ways that I'd describe him. When the other baby arrives is he going to start throwing tantrums. Don't give in to his constant whining as it will ruin your life and if you want my advice send him back to his mummy.|`|0P9GYAx6aa	Seriously, you need to drop this guy.  If you marry him he will try to control every bit of your life and if you try to have any freedom he will say you are cheating and may get violent hitting not only you but the child.

He might feel like he is trapped.|`|xFEuN9Vhaa	Some people are very insecure and have to be told a million times a day that you love them, they are nice looking etc. . . but it still isn't enough to fill that void they are feeling about themselves.  You can only tell him your feelings but you can't make him believe it.|`|7EPLQzueaa	Can I say that Slasher needs to be banned from here. All he seems to say is vile and disgusting things.

Do everything you can to show him you love him as much as you tell him. Take the initiative and surprise him with romance.|`|OH0JHlxsaa	Your fiance sounds insecure.  My husband can be the same way.  All you can do is tell him how you feel, that you appreciate him and love him and that you only want to be with him.  I don't think there is going to be some "act" wherein you can prove to him that you love him.  His acceptance of your love is his responsibility.  All you can do is reassure him and in time hopefully he accepts your statements as true.  Good luck to you.|`|cpmiJQyIaa	Well, it sounds like he either has self esteem issues or is making up a reason for you all to split.    Some guys naturally shirk from responsibility so they start garbage like that.  Has he said he thinks the baby is someone else's?  Has his friends or family been telling him it might be?    Somethings up.  I'm not trying to upset you, or make things worse, but my "moronic male radar" is beeping like mad right now.    I would start by asking him why he thinks you do not love him, and see where it goes from there.  If he gives you a bunch of really dumb answers, then it time to say, "Ok, none of this makes any sense.  What's really up?"|`|GRPxWmBxaa	ur bf seems da mushy kinda guy hu prefers dat his gf wud do specila stuff 4 him 2 make him feel special 4m time 2 time. So ur saying dat u love him all da time is not enuf 4 him. 1st of all stop saying it repeatedly otherwise da value of love will fall. 2nd do special things 4 hime like giving him surprises 4m time 2 time dat might help. besides ur gonna have a baby so he shud b da one telling u how much he loves u and do special stuff 4 u. He's so immatured. Sorry 2 say dat. Just say dis 2 him on his face and may b he'll realise dat he shud do all da loving and caring not u.
YEmsWyOJaa	my personal opinion on this is: Why is he with YOU? I mean if he doesn't trust you why would he want to make you both unhappy?  I'm not a jealous person at all, and the reason i'm with my husband is because we trust each other with no doubt in our minds!  He goes out by himself, i go out by myself. We of course do stuff together too, but we also have our own friends, and our own interests!   If I was you i would cut him loose! He's only gonna hold you back. He might be a really good guy, especially since he respects that you wanna wait for sex, but he's not the only one that will do that.  And as for you, you don't want him to change you. Yes he might be the hottest guy in school, but you and him aren't going anywhere. You are not mend for each other, and i think you know this, since you already get annoyed with him. Good luck, i hope i helped...  Mel|`|ArvEdl3paa	Damn girl. If he's too insecure, you should leave him, or tell him you'll leave him if he doesn't stop being so jealous.     I dumped my ex when he told me that he didn't want me to have anymore guy friends.     Find a guy who trusts you and is laid-back.     Plus if he wants to have a baby now...? I'm assuming you're still young. Tell him off, you're better off that way.|`|GRPxWmBxaa	so what if he's da hottest guy? dat's not a gud enuf reason 2 stay with a psycho like him don't u think. lemme tell u1 thing dat dis guy's insecurity won't go away even if u have a baby with him coz its a part of his nature. Plus after u have a baby with him his insecurity wud not only double but also he'll start dominating u thinking dat ur da his child's mom. He'll take u 4 granted. So u shud just moove on and make it vry clear 2 him dat ur thru 4 gud. If u wanna go bak thn it means dat ur welcoming trouble.

ifNr13kfaa	It's not easy.  I take it that your female.  As a guy, sometimes we do have to stay strong and there is a way to do it.  You have to be sympathetic, not empathetic.  When one show's empathy they associate themselves with the pain to get a closer understanding or feel for the person in a sense becoming like the person.  When one show's sympathy your standing with the person, and listening and caring, but not becoming.  To do it, think about what you should be doing, and how you should be helping her, not what kind of pain she's in.  It's not a matter of how in pain she is, that's not your job - your job is to figure out how to get her smiling again...Just take your time. If you have to break thought away from the situation if you feel tears coming.  I know you can do it...Good luck!|`|EccdNc8maa	It will take time for your friend accept what happen,however consoling her and assuring her that you will be by her side,tell her that her mum is on good hands and at peace already.It is only natural to cry remember we are only human,Pray for guidance and strenght.|`|ZAqlySc1aa	what you need to do is stay strong and try to make her laugh.

It was the worst.   when we heard the news we both just collapsed and cried together.   Its okay to cry.   But theres a time to cry and theres a time to be strong.   I think now you have to be strong for her. If she's really your friend she'll except your advice.   let her know that you're upset. and that she's making you feel all emo. and laugh about it.. don't make it all serious.. then it just gets awkward..   and try to cheer her up.   play cards with her. play checkers whatevs.   go shopping.   whatever you guys LOVE doing.   play hangman. whatever.   friends are the greatest blessing ever.   let her know that you care about her and she did anything to herself you'd be very upset.   The sadness will never pass. but you'll find a better way to deal with it eventually.|`|4ZAZfT0Gaa	Try to play jokes with her. try not to be idle otherwise she will remember her mum|`|2Cw0DfaSaa	think about eating poo|`|NTUr0t3haa	Think of it this way: She is saying very extreme things that she doesn't really mean. It's just her way of managing powerful emotions that she can't even label. If you remain relatively calm and say, "I can tell that you're overwhelmed right now" or "It's natural to feel despondent" or "Let it out", you may find that you're able to deal with it. You are a good friend and if you can't be 'strong' she will forgive you!
hECnTDCvaa	first up, i just wanna say congratulations on your decision to stick to what you believe in =) there arent many guys out there like you!    and yeah, for me personally i think it'd be lovely to know that the guy your about to experience something so intimate with had saved himself up until he met you! Its not a turn off at all, very sweet actually =)|`|810513944bc1fc28c514a617993b162faa	Its not a turn off to me, personally.  I'd be super flattered if a boy chose to abstain and chose me to lose his virginity to.  I might be in the minority though.|`|Q5FYrU9vaa	well not to me ... it probably would be for more experienced girls but im a virgin (17) as well soo yea|`|kej0H1AXaa	Virgin girls are the best because it's medically impossible for them to get pregnant their first time.|`|grAU3MJcaa	Only if she's a whore.|`|ACVKajUIaa	Mr O's comment is the biggest pile of bull sh1t ive ever read|`|4LYasBGXaa	if you are 18 and refusing to have sex ESPECIALLY as a dude, then a girl will think there is something wrong with you.    unless of course she is psycologically screwed up too.    of coruse if you are 18 and not abstaining then you are just 18 and the opportunity never arose- then there is nothing wrong with that- it was just the way you were, maybe you were ugly, shy, surrounded by fat girls, or just never had an opportunity to- what makes you abnormal is if you don't want to.    most guys who haven't had sex by 18 are because of circumstance, not lack of desire- if its lack of desire then that is highly abnormal.      If its religion, then you should meet someone of the same religion whose outlook on life is equally as screwed up as yours due to childhood indoctrination by your religion.|`|VSb6S6muaa	virgin or not you're still doing the samething...|`|DhQOvVYAaa	It depends. Maybe to a slutty girl it might be a turn off, but honestly I don't think it is a turn off to be a virgin. I know a lot of guys who are virgins and they are doing just fine.|`|UlEFgavdaa	No it is not a turn off, in fact that makes you more attractive. Many girls, especially in high school, are feeling the pressure like you are.  There is no time limit to lose it in fact everyone should be in love, be mature, respect themselves as well as the other person. My friend who is 23 is still a virgin by choice, she respects herself too much to just give it up to anyone. Continue to hold out for the right women, she is out there!|`|tjhOH6igaa	its not a turn off to me, i would like it if a guy lost his virginity to me !  it would make me feel special :)

yNbGq4viaa	If you have a boyfriend then you don't date other people.  That's what being someone's girlfriend means.  I have a great friend who is a guy, but my boyfriend knows about him and I clear it with him before I go out with my male friend.  Of course, it helps that they're both great guys and get along.  In your case, your boyfriend obviously does not want you around the other "friend" and your "friend" has made it clear that he is interested in more than being just friends.  At this point, you are in the middle of a, to put it bluntly, pissing contest.  A comedy show is not worth a relationship unless you really don't care about the guy you're dating.  This is not how mature people act.  You all three need to grow up a little.|`|ycNt74yyaa	You boyfriend needs to relax and stop being a jerk. But yeah, you should question your own reasons for wanting to spend time with the other guy too.|`|vOOf7xdEaa	sure, go for it.  Just dont act crazy|`|eWObKmBSaa	It depends on what kind of relationship you and your boyfriend have, cause this might end it.  Is that what you want, to end the boyfriend relationship?  Ask him if you can go with the other guy, get his response of one date, cause going out with the other guy is a date.  And that is how your boyfriend sees it, the other guy probably sees it that way too.|`|gkqSk29Zaa	You should go, it's just a friends date anyway. On top of that your not officially dating.|`|WMR8hVlfaa	I agree that your boyfriend is acting immaturely.    In high school, most of my friends were male. My boyfriend knows that when I go home, I'm spending my time with a bunch of guys or often just one guy alone. He doesn't have a problem with it because he trusts me. Sounds like your boyfriend doesn't trust you, and that's a huge problem.     I would talk to him about it. Tell him that you want him, not the other guy, but that you deserve to be able to have friends of the opposite sex without him freaking out and getting super jealous. If he really can't stand the idea of you going out with that guy since there are past feelings involved, maybe you shouldn't. But don't let him control you.    If he acts like this about any guy you talk to/are friends with, then take that as a warning sign.|`|29ddeea7f871392bf7b17a12fc77a694aa	you cant have both of them with a BF like that cause hes an *** plain and simple grow up before you get someone hurt or killed,|`|LMGWEPBtaa	Either go alone or not at all. Your "friend" wants more than just friendship if he is as aggressive as to go with you and your bf, especially if he does not like him.  If you want to be friends with this guy, you may not have a bf for long, because he knows what your "friend" really wants. And maybe you do too.|`|wQY6RXcvaa	There is nothing wrong going out with your friend JUST AS A FRIEND. My boyfriend had a cow when I went 4wheelin' with another guy. We were just friends and wanted to have some fun. Explain to your BF that y'all are just friends and want to go to the comedy. If he objects he can go to, but he has to be civil.|`|NJN8tP0Haa	tell your current boyfriend what you told us how hes just a friend and you already told him no. if he cant trust you then why are you with this guy? seems like if he cant trust you 100% then you 2 shouldn't be together.   I see why ur bf is jealous..  all us guys get jealous but if hes with u and ur with him then he needs to trust you. if he cant dont waste ur time with him..  relationships are built on trust and we need friends by our side no matter what .. friends are what you have in the long run...

I don't know what you would call it. It could also be that he is looking for a friend. I think you should decide what you want out of this relationship/friendship. Is it just a booty call? Or do you want more and can you handle it? You dont want to make the wrong decision well good luck.
winmjHAmaa	People who say you don't need someone in life, say those things because they don't have anyone.  I know, I've been there.  The truth is, God made us that way.  We want to be loved and cherished by someone other than our family.  We want someone who centers their life around us and who we can center our life around.

But it must be TRUE LOVE, not lust or infatuation,  and there is the extreme rarity of it.   Perfect love begins with God alone, giving the  greatest gift of His Son Jesus to all of us, that  we in our imperfection might be made perfect  in Him, and inherit eternal life.

I found that in the last 3 months wedding menus are starting to get back to the old fashioned way and simpler foods due to the economy. I personally think this is a good thing and that more people have more fun at these weddings, plus there is alot of variety and its different! Dont let any one tell you having different food is inapprorpriate. I just went to a wedding where chicken salad and corn dogs were on the menu, Do your thing and have fun. I love the mini PBandJ sandwiches too!|`|6dbb12cad0e32f793a90d33f0e0c9ae1aa	sounds like a really good price, and since its not meal time you dont have to go all out with a meal.    since its 4th of july, can you add melon balls? watermelon just says 4th to me|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	it sounds perfectly reasonable to me.  have fun!!|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Wowsers, it sounds just awesome - nice variety and the price is reasonable.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	If the food is good, then 16 bucks is a bargain!  If anything, I think you could remove the fruit with dips, and/or the pigs in blankets. But yes, it is appropriate for a mid-afternoon reception.|`|s6stLtvLaa	Yes, it is a great deal and it sounds perfect.  The cost for my wedding was $26 per person (and it was a 12 in the afternoon wedding).  Mine was a little more formal, but still very laid back wedding.      I hope your cake turns out good, mine was almost 900 for a 3 layer and it was awful! I don't know what my mom and I were thinking when we picked the cake out, it looked so much prettier the first time I saw it.|`|HLBdtP1Uaa	Sounds good for the price, but I would maybe change a few things like:    - Maybe have a cold pasta salad or a potato salad  - The only meaty items you have are the chicken skewers, pigs in a blanket, quiche and mac and cheese, I would add another hearty option, like maybe cocktail size meatballs or a gumbo      Is everything going to be outside in the sun? I would worry about the cheeses and dips going sour in the sun/heat. If that's not an issue I would add some cold cut platters and mini buns so people can make their own mini sandwiches.|`|gRZT4pnUaa	sounds like a good idea. I like the PBJ for the kids.lol.that's cute. The cake seems a little expensive though.|`|3MDY29gnaa	sounds pretty good! Well the mac and chz thing is a little diff. but okay    Oh and are the platters going to be served with the meal or not?|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Is this for the afternoon? If this reception falls at a mealtime this may not be enough food to satisfy hungry people and maybe you;d want to offer a larger entree like ham as well. However, if it is after lunch or before dinner you should be just fine. The price per person sounds good too.     Good luck!|`|MkErhX7Haa	Yeah, that's a steal.    PS.  can I come? Yum. ;-)    Actually, the cake seems a little high.  Do you have to use the same vendor for catering and the cake?  We got a 3 layer cake for under $300 and it was pretty ornate.  But your catered food is a really good deal.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	sounds good.|`|5DJcir9saa	The menu sounds good for that time frame, but $16 per person seems like a lot to me.  I paid $13 per person and did a full meal and received lots of compliments on how good the food was.  We had sweet pork and chicken breasts with this delicious gravy and rice as the main meat items.  Then we had three side dishes, veggie tray, fruit bowl, breads, and salad.  And that also came with coffee,  punch, and lemonade.  I live in Michigan though, so that might be a good deal in Georgia.|`|db67c0941f0845d64edf1a84aa913e6aaa	I think it's a great price...

jChbnuafaa	since your in my network i saw your question again     YES!!!  just do it !!!    anyway if she still just wants to be friends AT LEAST you no what it is like to kiss her and you never have to wonder what it would be like for the rest of your life    and if you guys are meant to be together then it will work out in the end    she obviouly wants you arond or she wouldnt have kept you around    JUST DO IT!  you will regret it if you dont!    if you do kiss her tell me how it went!   JUST KISS HER     good luck  -salsa|`|aVPhSOHFaa	yea go for it you never know she might like you a lot to...|`|5d5t1Rpeaa	be like" what would you do if i kissed you?"|`|xqan4ChSaa	DO IT DO IT DO IT DO IT DO IT DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|rDmxHRGjaa	yeah sure y not wat could happen???|`|6k61JQfRaa	ya.. maybe she's in love with you too so then you both will be able to be more open about your feelings, and even if she doesn't feel the same way if she is really your best friend she will forget about the kiss and you two can continue to be best friends as you normally would.|`|UlEFgavdaa	So she knows it but does she feel the same way? I've had a guy who is a best friend be in love with me but I did not reciprocate.. talk to her and make sure she feels the same way about you.|`|4hkM3HXyaa	You should totally talk to her and find out if she feels the same way. If you just kiss her, there is a HUGE possibility it could totally kill the friendship you do have.|`|ZIVBpYv1aa	yes! but dont force her to or make her uncomfortable. if she knows u like her and shee is still ur friend chances are she likes you too. if you do kiss her you must hesitate before u do (trust mee!!) so she will understand what u are doing. if she doesnt want to be kissed ull know.|`|FzscnfVKaa	best friends make the best girlfriends. they know you and you know them. you already know you guys get along, just take it one step further, and youll probly be the happiest guy alive|`|b34bd8ba67237d91495706dd79f215e7aa	SEDUCE HER... AND LET HER KISS YOU. THEN TELL HER HOW YOU FEEL..|`|w58Zebtgaa	Yes if you love her and you two are best friends.  I think you should know what or how she feels about you and if you know or have a feeling that she likes you too than go for it.  If she is your best friend maybe you can talk to her just to be sure I think either way, you can take a chance and kiss her and see what happens or talk to her and see how she feels.  Best of luck!|`|sHBPfItfaa	yep, i think you should.   if she says like "why did you do that?" or "what was that for?" be like "do what?" and "what was what for?" if she get aggravated she didn't like it. and if she laughs, she probably did. aha :P|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	YES !!!|`|jAqVoGlmaa	ya...yall can be lovers and friends|`|WMR8hVlfaa	If she knows it and hasn't said anything then chances are she does not feel the same way. Kissing her could seriously damage/ruin your friendship. If you feel like you want to try to move the relationship to a new level, then talk to her. Tell her how you feel and ask her whether or not she feels the same. If she responds positively, then go for it. But if she doesn't feel the same, then do not kiss her. You'll only drive her away from you completely and end up losing your friend.|`|65653c6c063e99db1f7f272c5c93e006aa	If she is your best friend tell her how you feel and what you are thinking.  You will be glad you had that discussion and she will too.
FddLQDaGaa	then to what ***** off.    a.ss -holes|`|AA12346188	NO - NEVER.|`|ai33g11Maa	Ok you seriously need to work on your English.    If there was no sex... there would be no life!    Duh!|`|c943b397bcbb13a99a8784c80691289eaa	sure, there are lots of interesting stuff to do without sex in our lifes. You just have to know more about yourself ( like hobbies) and concentrate on that. Choosing not to have sex is a dare thing to do but its not hard!     Good Luck|`|mg6gAfwYaa	Non Existence of sex would mean non-existence of life itself.|`|PDcnXgE6aa	Sex is playing very small role in ur complete life..........so LIFE must be GOOD as it is now...............|`|e74UmsLxaa	I think u mean can life be interesting without sex!! it depends on what u mean by interesting.for some,having faith in their partner interests them,for some sex does.So wat type r u!!|`|B9tdcrykaa	Despite the obvious fact that sex breeds life, I understand your question....      I believe that if you delete sex from your life even for a little while you really find out who you are and what makes you happy. You discover hobbies and talents you never thought you had. And most importantly, you discover a super strength within yourself. If you can go without sex, you can do almost anything. = )|`|mwOvJUO5aa	SEX IS THE IMPORTANT PART OF HUMAN-LIFE.|`|c36f79522258e0819141834902ebe130aa	Life is very interesting, in fact a bit more without the sex. Thing is that when you remove the possibility of sex from your thinking, even for a moment, it opens up quite a different perspective of the world.    You would be able to appreciate people better and you would be able to focus on your development a lot more than before because you are not chasing tail.|`|s0qmSDIWaa	NO NOT AT ALL. SEX IS THE PART OF LOVE.  IN KAMASUTRA BOOKS SEX IS THE WAY TO GO TOWARDS GOD
AA11760899	Ohhh, you can definately do this, easy.  Would you be ok skipping the restaurant or catering hall?   If so, then the options are endless. I know that DC is pretty pricey. If you really want something catered, shop around!! Or look to family style restaurants, BBQ places, small cafes, starbucks, or panera bread even does catering. Try those places you wouldn't think of.   Can you try a park, or friend or family members back yard?   That way, you can have someone make the food, Try finger foods, or sandwiches. I would nix the alcohol since thats a pretty hefty spike in the budget. or you could just do a desesrt and punch reception. Ask around, and come up wtih a plan. Your friends and family might be more willing to help than you think. everyone loves playing  a part in parties or weddings. types of food you could do are cocktail meatballs, soups, cookies, cold salads, cheese, etc.    Have fun planning!!!!|`|oXfvBdNHaa	Yes it is definitely possible. For the reception do a dessert reception to save money.|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	I'm not sure how the market is in DC, but I'm getting married for $3,000 which includes the ceremony, reception, dress, etc. for a guest list of 45 people in April of 2010.  It can most def be done. 4,000 is a decide budget, but you need to sit-down and make a good check list of things you need taken care of. With that budget there are certain things you may not be able to have. For example, I can't have lighting or elaborate centerpieces. My favors are going to be homemade, the groom's cake. And family is pitching in for the food. You have to be able to look around and thing about getting married in non-traditional places. DC has a lot of beautiful areas, I used to live there, and I'm sure you can have a wonderful ceremony. There's the University City Club of Washington, DC. for example. Try a small museum space or cultural center. There are plenty on U street or downtown. You can travel to Alexandria and find some small quite vendor halls.
LLeQyWGcaa	no i wouldn't get back with him just because at this moment seems to be a quick fix for your loneliness. if you are not in love with him, you could still feel lonely even if you are with him. take your time. go out with friends. if it was meant to be it will happen. be with someone who makes YOU feel loved too honey. you are worth it.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	when im feeling alone, i slap on some make up and high heels and call my friends for brunch, drinks & dinner or just hanging out, watching movies.     and loving someone you are not in love with is NOT a good reason to get back together. you'll end up in the same situation a few months from now.     let yourself wallow, hang out with the girls and eventually love will find its way back to you :)    good luck|`|AA12036375	If you aren't in love with him, it will never work. I wouldn't get back with him. You will come around eventually.  Sorry you lost your mom.
29ddeea7f871392bf7b17a12fc77a694aa	as soon as you realize they like you too|`|GTvyBTGyaa	Just walk tp to her/him and say did you want to catch up for a movie, tea, coffee, skateboarding, etc hang out with a group listening to music. what ever you normally do ask if she wants to come along.  if she likes you she will..good luck

They will allow you to change it to your husbands last name. Other than that you have to file it with the courts to have it changed. Its normally about $300-$1000.|`|d2da7e64032883f337805711b0c2a360aa	the better question is why would u do that? but anyways, u just go to the court and have papers and forms ready to change ur name|`|eWObKmBSaa	YOu do a first name change at the court house, my cousin did it.  Your last name will change with the marriage.  The social security will change your name when you send the old one in and tell them what the new name should be, same no., if you send another change in later with a firs tname change, they will change it again.|`|5k7BexD3aa	You have to go to court to change your first name.  Your last name will change automatically when you get married.|`|FAQldsUZaa	Not quite sure about changing your first name... court house maybe? But you go to the social security office to change your last name. Also you go to the MVA to change your last name as well on your license. Telling the person who marries you can not change your name for you. You will need your marriage license as proof of evidence.|`|iupKQv1Maa	Its easier than you know to change your name.  basically all you have to do is call credit card companies and say you changed your name.|`|bc087fc5c848c231a493eee2e0caecf8aa	u can automatically change ur last name when u marry,but to change ur first name u will still need to have it legally done-u pay a lawyer about $180 to do it(at least in my state).how do i know?i tried to do the same thing when i went to get my new  social security card after i married,but they refused to change my first name,and would only change my last.i had to later,have my first legally changed in the county courthouse,with a lawyer.|`|GC6tMi2saa	i think that is not going to help you need a lawyer , congrats (that's my due day )
gGZz2EGyaa	He might be an idiot you will never know until you speak to him.  The next time he passes and stares at you just say hello.  Simple as that and see what happens.  He could be an idiot or he could just be shy about coming forward, so make the first step and say hello.  Even shy guys do not stare that much or if they do its usually when they are sure the person cannot see them.  Go for it, make the first move.  If he is an idiot at least you can tell him to push off.  Good luck anyway what ever happens.|`|d2da7e64032883f337805711b0c2a360aa	at my school when i think theres a guy that likes me, he's always staring at me wherever i go and can notice me in a crowd, etc. i think he likes you and he's too shy to say anything..and if his friends look at you too when he's not there, that means he has been talking about you and he may like you..be careful, he might think ur totally weird too..but that probably won't happen considering ur in college..hope that helps! :)|`|wQY6RXcvaa	that's just creepy... ask him what his problem is and to stop staring|`|ea1ed505e3c0a89111a6fcd5e18dd1a8aa	No. He sounds human. He probably has a crush on you but is too shy to say anything. Just as well really as it sounds like you would be an utter ***** and crush him for any advance he made.|`|zhsD3S4caa	Sounds like some one has a crush on you and is a little afraid to say something.  I would find the staring over a long period of time a little odd / creepy.    Maybe you could send him an email, explaining your feelings and ask him out right. What the hell are you doing?? set up a bogus email account if you don't want him to have your email address.

PCrh5bOMaa	Nope, you are still a child and you arent mature enough to deal with the consequences of getting married at a young age.  With marriage comes a great deal of responsibility, something a 14 year old is not equipped to deal with.|`|td6WXhv4aa	Are you kidding? no way.|`|ps5zf4Gqaa	eww are u kidding me?  toooo youuunngg. dumb butts.|`|q3cbuc3Eaa	oh hell no.|`|ACVKajUIaa	yer because 14 is such a common age to get married isnt it..... >_|`|e9vcseLlaa	NO id wait till your older to make HUGE desisions like that!|`|Xf93fRTTaa	I'm not sure I understand the question, but 14 is NOT old enough to get married. Maybe it is in some countries, but here in the good old U. S. of A, we wait a little long.    A girl of 14 is far from all grown up.|`|b2zSN7wkaa	well being childish is something that everyone goes through. that will pass. you can't be married at 14 it's not right maybe in the olden days but NOT NOW! when you are 14 you should be living life and having boyfriends not with a husband. that's just bad news. it isn't even legal for you to have sex until you are 16 so what makes it okay for someone to get married at 14??? not a thing.|`|cyFqjkolaa	No way to young.  And the parents can run a legal risk as well.|`|rDmxHRGjaa	calm down geez!!! no it not okay to be engaged at 14 as a matter afact thats just wierd!!! but for some ppl its part of ther culture and that mostly the reason 4 them but i agree with you ur still young and a bit immature at that age and u deseve to kive ur life to the fullest and getting engaged that young IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT!!!!!|`|SUR1MHqWaa	Omg no!

a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	For the tray: a fancy key ring, a tampon, a ruler, scissors, a small knick-knack like a porcelain cat, a nice pen, a small picture frame, a fake flower, hand lotion travel size bottle, candy, fancy bandaids, fun paperclips, fancy sticky notes, a pair of earrings - assorted types of things that are useful but don't really go together, which makes them harder to remember. And of course condoms and lube! I used to play this game alot ( =    Good luck!|`|ODYrypwaaa	Walmart carries KY, and other similar items and even a vibrating ring! (it's in a pink box).

I would hope that you trust your friends more than you trust your relationships.|`|GTvyBTGyaa	they both sound like dickheads i wouldn't be interested in either of them. move on move on|`|ec002d411e45070bf9fb654942f1cefdaa	well that sounds a bit rough. was there a reason for it? violent guys aren't worth much i'd probs move on.
6J8sHGRIaa	Same here. :-/|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	I'm at home, and it's right after my husband left for work.  I have a choice of what to do: be on Y!A answering questions, be in the bedroom trying to sweep up the very dark brown dirt from the large plant our kitten knocked onto the floor from our tan closet, or be in the hallway, cleaning the linen closet and putting some stuff into boxes for storage.  I have something else to do, too, of course ... eat breakfast, but I try not to do that until 9:30.  I've already checked my email and I really don't want to do any work until after I eat.  Oh, there's one more thing I wish I could do ... torture the kitten for knocking the plant over.  I won't, but I sure wish I could!  Having fun?  Perhaps ... but I have the feeling that dirt on the bedroom floor is going to be a 'bone of contention' between me and the kitten until tomorrow, so today isn't as fun as it could be!  I'm older, by the way, a psychologist now retired.  Maybe I'll just go slip a new DVD into the Blu-Ray player and watch The Complete Jeeves and Wooster, which just came in the mail yesterday ... now that would be REALLY FUN, but only after I sweep up that darned dirt!|`|sHBPfItfaa	SNOW DAY! oh yeah :D hahaha|`|toLCaFc9aa	Not really, its quiet and I am getting hungry :(     Plus its snowing outside|`|AB3D5gIJaa	yeah shool is fun at times but it can also be boring.|`|AA11945637	fun at work|`|h3uUzhtiaa	Lol...of course....NOT!

I'm no longer in school and haven't been to school in ages.  Though on the computer, I am learning, one could say I'm in class.  I don't know what btw stands for yet. That was used in an  email I received earlier. It's the third time and not from the same person.  Would you happen to know what btw stands for?  Here is how it was used...Sleep warm.btw...Roxie.

If you aren't going down on her, why should you expect her to do it for you? Also, try keeping yourself clean. You guys can get pretty nasty down there. Ask yourself this question--would I want to put my mouth on that? If the answer is no, then get yourself to the shower.     Also, many women are nervous about giving head. Some just plain don't like it. If she doesn't want to do it, then you can't force her.|`|VSb6S6muaa	tell her you'll do something in return.|`|mbv2jLqDaa	Simply tell her, she shouldn't mind!|`|CFd0TsFFaa	Well i think you should first be open with ur relationship before u even ask her    and if you do please don't sound like u are desperate    and make her understand that if she says no it ok    and i think you should must of all BE CLEAN DOWN THEIR
YFXusnT1aa	Same situation for me, but you have to have some confidence in yourself. Maybe those are not the type of girls you want anyway. Someone who is only interested in what they see usually will not be around long.|`|nAqu6pMtaa	You need to see girls that look past your looks. I know you wouldn't like to hear that. But I'm a living example. Guys tease me for my looks. They actually say it in my face and it hurts so bad. But I met this guy and we got on really well. This guy told me I was beautiful and everything. And I feel so lucky to be his girlfriend now. He's like a fairytale. He's smart, good looking and rich. Besides that he's fun and kind and loves me alot. Don't be so sad alright. One day you will find Her. =)|`|Xf93fRTTaa	With that attitude you will be.    If you're unhappy with the way you look, do something about it. You need to get that self-esteem up. If you have acne, invest in Proactive. If you're heavy, start working out.     Do anything you can to feel better about yourself.
3mJiPveSaa	Keep things interesting, change things up to get re-aroused - change position (get on top, in front, etc.), get/give oral, change rooms, add clothes, take off clothes, add toys, etc. - and make sure you let your partner know what feels good as well as what isn't working. Don't keep doing the same thing if it's not continually exciting for either of you.|`|KOctm8uKaa	If you are having one orgasm after another, it doesn't really make sense to try and count them anyhow, one tends to roll into the next.|`|VSb6S6muaa	make it more interesting, ask your man to do things that turn you on.|`|29ddeea7f871392bf7b17a12fc77a694aa	yea its called the g spot and the clit im a guy and i know to do that with a girl.... i can get my woman off at least 10 times a night|`|Qztghhpuaa	take a look a "hegel exercises"|`|LGHMmRVFaa	get a vibrator|`|i1JVe24Oaa	You should ask your boyfriend to make you come before the intercourse (oral sex or fingering or whatever floats your boat) and then right after you come, he will enter you and then you should come the conventional way.|`|ea2395751480a69caa92c51b9cfe1156aa	It isn't a talent, its the way you're wired, and not everyone can do it.

MYbRICxqaa	Before your boyfriend, you were in a bad situation that caused you to think negative of other people. I was wondering, did you see someone after your rape. You have emotional and other serious issues that should have been discussed with a counselor. Your situation involves more than just envy issues. These problems should not be discussed on Yahoo.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	You really need help dealing with your jealousy.  I think you will be able to deal with it on your own, but that will come with age and maturity.  If you do not want to wait that long, then seek out some counseling.  Jealousy will only cause you and those you love grief. So get some help.  Good luck.|`|aXYiOskmaa	sounds like your jealousy stems from your insecurities and low self esteem  edit- in your other question you said you hate guys and like to look at girls.i think you're a bit of a troll|`|5k7BexD3aa	If you don't find a way to control your jealousy issues, he will end up dumping you.|`|tsBL19qzaa	You are insecure and have a low self esteem problems. That is why you are acting the way you are. Until you address those issues, you will just keep acting out of fear and will never be able to have a healthy relationship.|`|veZLfnGFaa	Get ready to be hurt even more  Sometimes holding on too tight to someone can drive them away.  Give yourself a break.  You know there's a problem here and it's too big for you to fix.  Get some help before it's too late for this relationship.  If you love him, help yourself and make it easier on both of you.  Good Luck :)|`|fYv0dtUFaa	sounds to me like you have a lot of serious issues going on that are the cause of your jealousy...you need way more help than anyone on YA can give you...you need to see a thearapist|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	im sorry but this is the marriage and divorce column. learn to read between the lines of your boyfriend and learn to read and you might be less jealous.|`|dc5bTUtmaa	It sounds obvious luv, get some professional help. Womens Aid or similar organisations have excellent counsellors for your type of problems.|`|O46f8wl3aa	You obvisouly have low self esteem issues... Maybe you could see some form of counseling.|`|HLIv7TLHaa	It appears to me that you have the answer to your behavior within the context of your question.    Time to do some deep soul searching.  Learn to trust your intuition, instincts and insight.    By doing that, you will find your way past the negative behavior you abhor.
2h5tHk0naa	When you try to ignore him he always catches up with you...i mean he gets curious about why you are not paying attention on him...plus then he must be trying to get back the attention...what you can do is ignore him for  3-4 days so that you can make him react a bit different o take out what he has in his mind and heart....it will clear the picture in your mind about his feeling.....so that you can approach him confidentally
lHCZUPm2aa	She should tell him the truth, and then they both can see if she should still go. And I hope they you really talk to her about safe sex if she does go.|`|WMR8hVlfaa	She MUST be truthful and tell this man. HIV is a serious condition and she is being incredibly irresponsible by not being honest. I know it's hard for HIV-positive people to date. It sucks, but at the same time when you have a disease that is incredibly easy to transmit and permanent/fatal, then you can't risk being dishonest. She needs to tell him. It may result in her losing him, but eventually it would have to come out and it would be really awful for her to become attached and then get hurt.     Has she tried a support group? I'm sure there are also dating websites for HIV-positive singles that she might try. There she wouldn't have to be dishonest or afraid.|`|Y45E3SWGaa	well i believe she should tell him first  poor guy if he thinks he got lucky and laid the girl just to find out he got a std  but if hes ok wit it she should go|`|zLlBQwuFaa	Your friend should be clear of what his intentions are for this cruise? Based on his intentions (and her intentions) she can determine whether to tell him or not.  Her health is a private matter until it puts others at risk.  If she knows the purpose of this trip is romance... then she should be upfront from the beginning.  If the purpose of the trip is to spend time and get to know each other, then she can hold off on telling him until she feels that they are going to kiss or have sex or whatever.    Other questions your friend should ask herself include:  Based on how long I've known this guy - is it safe/smart to go on this trip with him?  Where do I want this relationship to go?  Based on answers, she should then decide whether to go on the trip or not.|`|uhSPd3d4aa	I believe that your friend should go on the cruise if she plans on not having sex with him. To the contrary of what was said HIV is not that easily transmitted from a woman to a man. It is definitely a serious condition and your friend should be honest before taking that step but she should not let the virus stop her from dating and meeting new people. I'm positive and my husband is negative, we have been together for three years and have a one year old son who is also negative. So its not the end of the world or her life.
AA12036375	Eyes, Smile and fingernails.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	smile, by far. its soooo telling!|`|bH5dU3tAaa	For me, i generally notice overall appearance and whether or not he's at ease with himself.
HSOp9J4Iaa	First of all you need to respect yourself, and live your life... Go to yoga classes.   Its seems that you have been programmed about relationships.  newer start the relationship without love, true attraction and trust.  Everything else is garbage.  Don't concentrate on it,,, spent your time to open your mind, to learn new things, to become better person, and when you get better, -- good people will be attracted to you so you will not need to worry about staff you asked. It is very sad for me That people don't have basic understanding of real relationships and real love,,,  And instead waisting their mind power and lives for meaningless procrastinations|`|S46FYzmjaa	Sounds like you're in quite a predicament. My advice is that you forget them. Don't allow any boy to toy with your emotions. Don't set yourself up for downfalls either.If you know a guys a jerk, he's a JERK and you can't\shouldn't expect anything else from him. I'm not saying  you are but, try not to be dependent on men.Often they will let you down and you can attract the right guy when you learn how to become an independent, confident woman. they like that! have faith in yourself and you won't be "lonely" much longer :))    hope i helped ya!
ygGr1nX7aa	Ultimately, only you can make that decision.  It might help to ask yourself what it is you're unsure about and, once you've figured it out, talk about it with your partner.  Make no mistake that LDRs are hard, and sometimes feel like banging your head against a brick wall, but the important thing is how you feel when you're together.  I'm engaged in a transatlantic relationship, and if it's at all possible, I highly recommend finding a way to live with your partner for a few months or longer, just so that you know that as well as loving each other you can live with each other.|`|XCn2dK1laa	I was in the exact same situation as you.  I was in a long distance relationship for two years and he and i lived on separate continents. We were supposed to meet last year but we broke up in May of last year. Pretty much,all we learned from long distance relationships is how to live without each other but hey,that's just me.Y'all could be totally different.|`|MxRs8WCTaa	I'm about ready to be in the same boat :( Idk what I'll do we will be over an hour away from each other I I work all the time I feel like when she moves it will all crumble.    I wish you the best of luck.
edop01VPaa	don't force anything, but maybe tell her about it after she's had time to get over your friend and him over her. what's the worst that could happen?     btw i think u meant "More THAN friends"  just saying|`|dtnFX2ylaa	be her best friend only otherwise you will lose your friend he will  be jealous of you & will hate both of you things can go wrong . you may lose your friend as well as this girl|`|3y0w1qIBaa	For now, it is not wrong for you to break them up.  Making them to break up is very wrong.  I think you should tell her your feelings.  Just say along the lines of, "How would you feel if I told you that I like you"?  You never know just by asking.  Also you may want to ask your friend for permission if you can go out with this girl.|`|Y45E3SWGaa	**** fallin for her   hit tht then go to her bff  then hit tht|`|l3KIMkoEaa	its you.|`|96b59fcf3c9991d7d83e56d6bf1b2f6caa	if u go out wit her that will be mest up for ur friend thats goin out wit her c'mon man BROS b4 HOES
96b59fcf3c9991d7d83e56d6bf1b2f6caa	you can just say NO we better as friends n if he dont understand than idk lol|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Honesty is the best policy.  You should go along the lines of, "(name), you're a great guy and everything and I am sure that a lot of girls would love to go out with you because of a wonderful personality that you have.  For now, I just want us to be friends."  Ask yourself a question, it may be worth a try to go out with him and see how it goes.  It looks like he respects you and your wishes as well.|`|e74UmsLxaa	Tell him that u like him but never thought of as a boyfriend.But also tell him that he deserves someone better than u!!(to console him!!)|`|Y45E3SWGaa	say yes its the best experience youll ever have  trust me i dated a bff
AA12202402	I had to learn from the start that I can not make my fathers son see the hurt and feel the need to visit as i do. I feel calls are post to happen when there is birthdays christmas etc My ex doesn't. I want my sons dad in his life as much as possible but my son's dad didn't. How did i handle it. Biting my lip all day every day and yes fibbing to my child. Telling my child that daddy's job keeps him from visiting. Always being positive and NEVER EVER saying negative things about the dad. It kind of bids up a ok feeling with the child. If you start telling the child your dad is sorry it only hurts him and makes him mi sable. Lets face it that is the opposite of what ya want. One day your child will grow up and realize the truth of it all, Mine did and come to you. At that point he will be old enough to understand you would jump over the moon and back to try to keep him from being hurt. Time tells truths|`|CINdqEhzaa	well im in the exactly the same situation. If your ex was a bad dad just constantly explaiin that to your child. i think its one of those things youll just have to live with untill he's old enough to understand. After school one day every week, ask your child if he would like to write a letter to him and it could be a fun activity.    best of luck,
P7PdJKGfaa	You can't hide your feelings. It's only natural. I was in a similar situation, and i just let it go and continued to be friends with the girl, and never addressed it with my friend. Everything worked out great, but if you have "feelings" for this girl, well then you might need to address them, because you'll be sorry if you don't.|`|KrkftOfkaa	Actaully NOT bringing it up is probably making things worse.  If he doesn't like it he's "bottling it up" right now and he's going to snap on one or both of you at some point.  Get things out in the open and find out if he's okay with your behavior or not. If so let him know to let you know if you cross a line some where.  If not then you need to change the way you interact with his girlfriend.  If he has a problem with it, but not brining it up himself all you are doing is undermining their relationship.|`|0F8hauikaa	I think if the question is in your mind (and here), the answer is yes.|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	I think if you have to question it that you shouldn't be doing it-unless its all of you together-|`|toLCaFc9aa	Maybe you are, I am friends with my husband's best friend but I don't chat with him every day, it won't look good. Try to cut the chatting a bit, otherwise it may bring up problems.|`|sHBPfItfaa	i don't see how that's a big deal unless your talking about hooking up or something, then obviously that's wrong and you shouldn't even have to ask. im assuming your just talking about random, everyday stuff. your friend shouldn't get so jealous. your allowed to have friends, right?|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	any sexual innuendo's are WRONG  asss whooping wrong|`|vOOf7xdEaa	sure why not, hopefully he cant kick you a**|`|btyElokJaa	not really no  It's not like uve got her wangers out is it|`|mAPSl0DZaa	How does your best friend feel about it. If you are doing this behind his back and dont want him to know then yes you are and the fact that you are feeling he is not liking it could be a clue.|`|Xf93fRTTaa	You know whether it's wrong or not. . .|`|ZU2nlPGVaa	In depends how far you take that 'chatting'. Who's more important here, your friendship with this guy, or the flirting that's going on with this girl?|`|53Ss6fOGaa	Not if you're not doing anything wrong by talking. If the conversation is just normal, nothing sexual or joking about sexual things it should be okay, I think. If you feel like it's more than just a friendship, maybe you should stop. It's not fair to your best friend.|`|mJDqKejtaa	just alil just tell him that u and his girl r just friends and nothing else|`|HEOWbQIXaa	Yes you don't want to drive them crazy where they say I don't want to be your friend|`|xTpvnWRuaa	Yeah well I think it's better to be honest with how you feel.|`|29ddeea7f871392bf7b17a12fc77a694aa	nope not at all if you are just friends and there is nothing going on then its all good no worries until you get shot by your friend|`|fnk27F8xaa	Grab her boob and see what she does.|`|10541eb54f0b51e5e05e9e92b9882bbaaa	well, if u get the feeling...understand that he too is getting it since u seculated it and back off. But may be u won't back off until someday someone gets you with the same stuff...and dont think it's impossible.|`|tjKwiYZtaa	i don't think there is a problem with talking i mean if god didn't want us to talk he would not give us the ability to talk|`|X5afTqKiaa	I don't think so it depends on if you love the one your not supposed to.......................|`|L4E166ZCaa	The chatting isn't what's wrong. What you're doing wrong is continuing this behavior with his girl even though its obviously hurting ur bff. Of course it isn't "wrong" to juz talk to her but it is wrong to be so inconsiderate of ur friends feelings|`|VSb6S6muaa	it depends on what you "chat" about ya know ? i mean i'm sure my boyfriend would be pretty mad if his best friend was talking to me all the time, ya know ? you're supposed to be the best friend... but i mean if you guys are friends, and always have been then that's okay.|`|NDGEzeCVaa	um maybe. depends on what you're chatting about too. hmm WHAT R U CHATTING ABOUT? but obviously,  u know u r wrong, cuz if u didnt feel guilty, u wouldnt be asking this question lol. Lets see if u can stand the "good friend" test lol. and i bet he doesn't know that u 2 chat so much on aim lol. LAME! LOL|`|VOYSmwOXaa	No of coarse not,chatting with her is not wrong! Your should tell your friend your chatting with her so in case that your friend finds out and makes things go wrong! SO tell him how you feel k! And don't stop chatting with her!|`|uk5s9YVFaa	heck nooo if you have the right intentions then you can do what ever you want|`|b2zSN7wkaa	well not really as long as it is just talking, and well I mean at least try and include your bestfriend in your conversations. no one wants to feel left out especially when it is your bestfriend and his girlfriend.|`|MjbLGaegaa	do you want to be more than friends with the girl?  if you do i think you should back off, stealing your best friends girl would not make you very popular.    but if you are just friends with her i dont really see the problem. but sometimes it can get annoying when your girlf/boyf is talking more to your friend than to you :\     how does your best friend feel about it? is he worried you guys are getting too close?    but if he is cool about it dont worry :)|`|n6DGucxNaa	no just as long as your mate knows about it and its with innocent intent|`|ilS9Pakxaa	I think its wrong for you to be chatting...but do you have nay feelings for her?? i|`|02Rrrz47aa	well you guys can talk..on a platonic level, but if your starting to get personal with things then ur buddy has every right to knock you out|`|IZ2Bx0BTaa	She should be chatting with him not you.|`|4YSSOO7Taa	Depends how insecure your friend is.    It shouldent matter, you have the right to talk to who you want.|`|UlEFgavdaa	As long as you aren't constantly flirting with her or are trying to get with her, you are not doing anything wrong. Your friend may be jealous because him and his girlfriend do not connect the same way you do with her.|`|OydWDKcAaa	No, if anything you should be conversing more.  Generally women desire that one male friend outside of their relationship who is good friends with her boyfriend.  It allows her to have someone to comfort her in situations when her bf may be acting like a jackass and help to understand them.      I would suggest talking to her more and becoming her best friend.  Your friend will love you for it and youll be gaining a new one.  Be sure to firmly squeeze her breasts now and then too, she'll love it.|`|KpIhRZdhaa	No not at all.  If your friend trust you then there shouldnt be any   reason for him to worry about what you and his girl talk about.    He should also trust his girlfriend to not let anything thing happen.  If he doesnt then they shouldnt even be going out ion the first place.|`|uKePwBuMaa	i dont think theres anything wrong with being close friends with your bestfriends girl. nobody can stop you from being close friends aslong as it stays that way. crossing the line would be flirting with your bestfriends girl. maybe you should talk to your bestfriend about it, if you really are bestfriends then im sure he would understand. just remember nobody can tell you who you can and cant be friends with.|`|XOIK4caLaa	My question would be is does your best friend know that you talk to her and how often/long you talk to her on AIM?    Also, think of it this way...knowing how long you spend talking to her, would you feel comfortable if your best friend was on AIM with YOUR girlfriend for that amount of time??    One more thing, do yall discuss anything that you would feel uncomfortable about discussing in front of your best friend??    Just some things to consider to hopefully help put things in perspective, but if you're honestly wanting an answer, the fact that you posed the question at all means you probably know that it's not completely acceptable.      Good luck!|`|UPD45e9Naa	i have the same prob almost my gf doesnt like me hanging around girls that are just my friends i admit i do hang out with alot of very pretty girls but she gets jeolus i tell my gf "just relax its just u and me i dont want any1 else but u but if u cant accept the fact the i have friends that are girls then i dont think i can b with u" needless to say she dosent get bothered any more buy it atleast she dosent show it. and no i am not cheating|`|wQY6RXcvaa	There is nothing wrong with talking to her.Just don't let it go any farther than that. It will damage their relationship and yours and your friends.|`|NeIYmhaAaa	I don't think there is anything wrong with it. As long as it is just chat and not flirting. You should also make it clear that she is your best friends girlfriend. Also make sure she isn't looking for anything else.|`|on6dC4A8aa	The fact that it bothers your friend is probably the only answer you need, but ask yourself this: Does he know how much time you spend chatting with her? Would you do it in front of him? Do you say things you wouldn't say in front of him?  If you are doing something you need to be deceptive about, that shows that you already know it's wrong.|`|xdSR5HcJaa	Ask yourself... do you have any feelings for her? if not then it could be innocent as long as she doesnt have feelings for you. I dont see why you couldnt have a friendship with her if you go out in groups of friends and she's there. But you are the one who would know if it's innocent or not. If it's innocent then I dont see anything wrong with it, but if your friend really has a problem you should step back if you want to keep him as a friend. If it's not quite innocent than you need to talk to the girl and let her know that you like her so you not gonna keep chatting because that would be moving in on her and she's dating someone else,....your best friend...
gjdd7bVWaa	Your mother is overprotective, sure, but doing that will kill her emotionally.  If she's overprotective and trying to keep you safe with her curfews, she's trying to keep you closer, not push you away.  Leaving her is the opposite of what she wants.  Try talking to her about extending your curfew, or seeing your boyfriend more often.  If you're as close to his family as you say, you're probably always going to see him, rather than him coming over.  Have him for dinner sometimes.  If you're always going to see him rather than him coming to see you, she might not know them that well, or trust him very much.    If you're dead-set on moving out, be prepared for crying, fighting, and other issues.  There's really no way around it.  But please, realize what you're doing.  I went through this with my parents when I was 18.  I didn't actually move out, but I came very close, and it nearly killed them.  To this day, I regret what I did to them.  You will too, one day.  If you want to move out, try to approach her at a calm moment, because it won't stay calm for long.  Don't spring it on her.    Good luck.  Please realize what you're doing.|`|R8fEO8tUaa	uhh i think you just need to tell her that you cant live with her rules, and that youre considering moving out    ask her if she can change her rules or controlling ways, and if she declines tell her that you have a moving out plan already, but you dont want her out of your life|`|s0Kh3LaEaa	If she knows that your frustrated with her, then this is something she should expect.  You don't need to explain yourself to her, unless you want to do so.  My brother moved out at 17, and my parents understood.

I suggest you should shorten the time on the phone with him, and maybe go over his crib sometimes and talk there, or when its nice outside go to the park, sometimes it wouldn't hurt to go ol' skool and go to the movies together then dinner at a nice restaurant (make sure he is treating) also it wouldn't hurt to double date; maybe some of your friends and some of his friends could go bowling or go-car riding, or any fun game activities. I hope this works for you, as it did for me! Good Luck!

YjL6ziBtaa	Most christian leaders will tell you the only reasons for a valid divorce are infidelity, physical abuse, psychological abuse (hard to define), and substance abuse.     If you meet one of the above criteria divorce should be pursued, if not then don't, because you made a commitment before God.    If you believe in christianity, "I don't love him any more," doesn't cut it.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	According to the bible, God allows divorce for only two reasons: adultery and death. If you divorce for any other reason it is considered a sin.  Divorcing because you simply do not love someone anymore is a sin. You can separate, get counceling, mediation, etc. however divorcing for that reason is not allowed/accepted by God.|`|rcut6bhoaa	Read I Corinthians Chapter 7 vs 39|`|upAEUz9Naa	Jesus Christ, in his Sermon on the Mount, stated: Moreover it was said, Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce. However, I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife, except on account of fornication, makes her a subject for adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. (Mt 5:31,?32) Also, after telling the Pharisees that the Mosaic concession of divorcing their wives was not the arrangement that had prevailed from the beginning, Jesus said: I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except on the ground of fornication, and marries another commits adultery. (Mt 19:8,?9) Today, generally, distinction is made between fornicators and adulterers. According to modern usage, those guilty of fornication are unmarried persons who willingly have sexual relations with someone of the opposite sex. Adulterers are married persons who willingly have sexual relations with a member of the opposite sex who is not their legal marriage mate. As shown in the article FORNICATION, however, the term fornication is a rendering of the Greek word porneia and includes all forms of illicit sexual relations outside of Scriptural marriage. Hence, Jesus words at Matthew 5:32 and 19:9 mean that the only divorce ground that actually severs the marriage bond is porneia on the part of ones marriage mate. The follower of Christ may avail himself of that divorce provision if that is his desire, and such a divorce would free him to marry an eligible Christian.1Co 7:39.    Sexually immoral acts committed by a married person with someone of the same sex (homosexuality) are filthy and disgusting. Unrepentant persons of this type will not inherit Gods Kingdom. And, of course, bestiality is Scripturally condemned. (Le 18:22,?23; Ro 1:24-27; 1Co 6:9,?10) These grossly filthy acts come under the broad designation porneia. It is also noteworthy that, under the Mosaic Law, homosexuality and bestiality carried the death penalty, freeing the innocent mate for remarriage.Le 20:13, 15,?16    Jesus Christ pointed out that everyone that keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. (Mt 5:28) But Jesus did not say that what was in the heart, but not carried into action, furnished a basis for divorce. Christs words show that the heart should be kept clean and one should not entertain improper thoughts and desires.Php 4:8; Jas 1:14,?15.    Nothing is said in the Scriptures that would permit a Christian to divorce a marriage partner because that one was physically unable to perform the marital act, or had gone insane or contracted an incurable or loathsome disease. The love that Christians are to show would call, not for divorce, but for merciful treatment of such a mate. (Eph 5:28-31) Nor does the Bible grant Christians the right to divorce their marriage mates because of difference in religion; it shows instead that by remaining with an unbelieving mate the Christian may win that individual over to the true faith.1Co 7:12-16; 1Pe 3:1-7.      A single person who commits fornication with a prostitute makes himself one body with that person. Similarly, the adulterer makes himself one body, not with his legal wife, but with the immoral person with whom he has sexual relations. The adulterer thus sins not only against his own personal flesh but also against his legal wife who until then has been one flesh with him. (1Co 6:16-18) For that reason adultery provides a true basis for breaking the marital bond in accord with divine principles, and where such ground exists, a divorce obtained brings about the formal and final dissolution of th|`|4boTYkt7aa	God tells us that the only reason for divorce is adultery.Maybe you haven't stopped loving him,maybe you just need to try to reconnect with each other.Don't give up.This world is so cold.|`|09CkgnEHaa	Well how long hav u been married? U should know if u really love that person b4 u get married.
fHfVRcqbaa	Honestly, I wouldn't put up with it.  Let him know that his behavior is unacceptable and that if you start to get phone calls like that during this deployment, you will stop accepting calls from him.  I would keep writing letters and sending care packages, but he needs to learn how to deal with the separation.  It's hard on everyone, and the worst part about any deployment is the looming question "Will they be faithful/will we have a relationship after this?"  If you have never given him reason to doubt you, then he is seriously out of line and you need to let him know that he has bigger things to worry about--like staying alive.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Well for one i have a bank account that is just in my name he cant access. Mainly cause I had it before we were married. I take so much $ to put it in every payday. It comes right out of the paycheck so we don't really miss it. If he cuts you off you can also go to his command and they will give you at least the money for the housing allowance cause your taking care of the child and that's about the same thing as child support but if a soldier cuts his wife off then they will draft the $ out his check and he gets no say in it. That way you have at least however much his BAH is. Any wife who gets cut off can do this though his command! It doesn't matter if you have kids or not. Then the behavior he needs to know that he can trust you and from what you said he doesn't the reason he acts that way when he is gone. Good things you guys aren't army. You would never make it though one of our deployments. See a couples counseling while he is still home. That way its a safe place you can take to him about the way he acts when he is gone. Then the councilor can help you guys to communicate better. Good luck!|`|5k7BexD3aa	In a relationship--are you married?  He can't just cut the $$ off if you are.  If you have a son together, get a support order in place and he will have no choice but to pay.  Sounds like he is very controlling.|`|CmZ2cLIqaa	If he is your husband and overseas, he has no right to take away the bank account funds. You could call his superior and tell him of his attitude and actions, my mother did this when my father was overseas and cut her off from all funds.. The superior will probably put him on anti depression medication while he's over seas and tell him to man up and stop acting like a child.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	Talk to him! tell him he needs to continue supporting you while he is away, or at least taking care of your child. I know it can be hard but when there overseas they see a lot that we can never understand. they have buddies that wives and gf's are cheating on them and there at war and it is hard for them to deal. military has a 90% divvorce rate and i can see why he would be skeptical. you jsut have to do your best to reassure him that all is well. send him lots of love notes/emails and care packages with pictures from home to remind him what he has waiting for him. in the meantime before he leaves sit down and tlak to him, explain how hard it is for you when he is gone and hwo when he is hurtful it make you want to cry. ask him to be more gently and to try and do his best to remeber what you guys have.|`|Lb6Y7xlnaa	Wow!.. Ok, my Fiance' and I are actually surviving a deployment now. He has two months left to complete his 15 months of being over there. At the beginning, he and I were seperated but kept in touch,, Then we got back together. Its a difficult thing to go through, but if your his WIFE, you should be there for him.  You should also tell him how you feel. Let him know you are just as grown as he is and that if you wanted to go out and do somethin, you would have already. Let him know you want to be with him and that you love him. Remind him that yu miss him too, but that his temper-tantrums need to stop.   About the Bank Account.. you need to do something about that ASAP. get your own or make sure you call the bank and find out how you can stop him from locking ou out of whats YOURS as well as HIS. If your son has an emergency, and your Man is playing games, then what?? Thats not right.  Keep your head up through all this. And if this is not your HUSBAND, then you should DEF let him know that you don't have to take this and that you deserve respect. It will get better, and if it doesn't, you always have the option to LEAVE!|`|vxPrPsD2aa	I know how you feel. I'm just getting divorced from my husband, and it sounds like he did the same thing to me, that your hubby is doing to you. First of all, are you in government housing? Secondly, he can't just cut off your money, since ya'll have a kid together. You can always do as the person stated and get a court order, or whatever she said. Or you can cause a big ruckus and go to his higher ups and have them deal with it. I was living in government housing, and my soon to be ex hubby stopped supporting me all together, which by 'military law- if you live in government quarters he legally is doing his job by providing a house over your head and isn't liable to send you money while you're in government quarters'. Well... at least that's how the Army handles it. I'm sure it works a lot differently with children.    Anyways- as for the mean part, either talk to him about it, or let him know that you're not going anywhere by sending him care packages and letters and pictures. I really don't know much about ya'lls relationship so I can't help too much other than tell you to talk to him about it. I also know, every branch in the military offers marriage counseling, after deployments so you can always try that out. I'm not saying what he IS doing is right, because it's not, but sometimes they can't handle being away and don't know how to go about expressing their feelings the right way.    I really hope this helps. If you need anything else, email me. I'm all ears for a fellow military wife.  RachelElise1987@yahoo.com
YWPJzFoOaa	I used to think the same thing about my MIL.  When my husband and I first got married, she played nice in front of my hubby but if we were alone she was a real pain the a**.  I never would say anything to her or to him because I didn't want to cause problems.  Then one day we didn't know he was around and she smarted off.  I'd had enough so I got right back in her face.

The kids probably DO deserve to know his side of the family unless they're completely deranged or something, you probably should be gracious with what you have left of his things -- she IS his MOTHER afterall!! -- and you should all try to be a little nicer to each other.... you all lost someone you loved.

Sometimes they might never come around to you, but you might find a common ground and get along better.  Just give it some more time and see what happens.

yJSPecgoaa	Im so sorry that people are being cruel to your brother at school.      You are a wonderful sister to care about your brother and to want to help.  You did the right thing by talking with him about it last night, in the process helping him more than you may realize. (Just think how awful it would have felt for your brother, after enduring the bullying in the first place, to then hold all the hurt and sadness inside.)      Its also good that you told your mother about the bullying, but do make sure, if you havent already, that she doesnt yet mention what she knows to your brother.  Its important that your mother know what is going on, but its just as important that you not lose your brothers trust and ability to confide in you.  Because he likely has no one else to confide in, he needs you right now more than ever.      It is not at all surprising that your brother didnt want to tell your mother about being bullied at school.  Children who are bullied are usually filled with shame about it, and it often can be very hard for them to tell anyone about it, including their own mother.  In addition, at his age, he is in the midst of trying to gain emotional  independence from his mom (a vital and necessary part of the maturing process). Because your brother didnt want to tell your mother *himself,* his wishes to not talk to her about the bullying (just yet anyway) need to be respected.  This is very important, as your brother needs, more than ever, to be able to trust his family right now (since the outside world is one he *cant* trust).  The purpose of telling your mother is mainly to allow her to be aware of, and therefore sensitive to, what is happening to your brother at school.  Until your brother decides to talk to your mother about it, or gives you direct permission to tell her about it, your mother ought not yet directly confront your brother about the bullying information youve given her.    However, it would be a very good idea for your mother to meet with the teacher and principal(face-to-face would be best) to make sure they are aware of the bullying your brother is enduring, as well as to ask what measures they intend to take to minimize it, if not counteract it altogether.  Unless the school is willing to act with zero tolerance towards bullying, it really isnt a healthy environment for *any* child, and certainly not for your brother.      In the meantime, the best way for you to help your brother right now is to continue to be as caring and compassionate as youve been the last two days.  You are so right in knowing to avoid lashing out at him or saying hurtful things to him.   More now than ever, he needs your compassion, your love, your trust, your understanding, and your support, in addition to which he needs you to respect him as a person (not just a little brother).  This is what you are giving him right now, and it surely matters to your brother more than you can imagine.      Wishing you, your brother, and your mother all the best.      ETA:   Oh my word, when I began this answer to you, there was only *one* answer. Now there are over 20!!  And so many wonderful, caring answers as well.  You and your brother deserve all the support and good thoughts being sent your way by so many.  God bless you both.|`|urmhRHwxaa	The only thing he can really do is punch them in the mouth when they say something like that.  I know it sounds harsh and overly simplistic, but the only other realistic thing to do would be if he could find a way to make fun of them.    Don't tell him to talk to the teacher...even if he/she intervenes, it will send the message to the kids that he's too much a p*ssy to fight his own battles (I don't believe that, but the kids will, trust me) and they'll just do it when the teacher isn't around....I mean, he's not going to run to an adult every time someone calls him a name.      Your advice about making friends isn't bad, but I wouldn't suggest that he try to "hide" in the library during recess....that will only make the kids respect him less.    Bullying is all about power.  Can I make you do something you don't want to do?  Can I hurt you whenever I feel like it?  The answers to it are direct and not that pleasant, but they're all that's out there unless he's planning on changing schools.|`|AA11674544	Talk to your mom and dad and brother together. Make an agreement that at least at home he will have a safe place to be where no one will yell at him or make him hurt. Home should be a safe place to come home to, not a battleground with more stress. Then, see if your mom can call the school and have the counselor work on focusing on Bullying to all the 5th graders (not just the bullies). Also, see if your brother can get into something to raise his self esteem. Boyscouts would be a great choice! Being weak and having low self esteem is what is causing him to get picked on. If not boyscouts, try karate. He needs more positive attention at home. Dinners together. Help with homework. He NEEDS to have a loving family! That must happen first and you can help! Good luck!    Wow! based on your new information, I would tell your mom to go to the school and have him moved to another class. It is her right to do this! The school may say they don't want to, but if she wants to, she can Make it happen! Poor kid, give him a hug from us.|`|msUIsv8maa	Try to find another hair gell or maybe a spray that dont leave residue in his hair|`|PtACBQNgaa	encourage the teacher to get involved, maybe have a class talk and address the problem?    that is a difficult situation and i know how hard teasing is.  i am sorry and i hope you and your brother solve the problem soon.|`|6oVhzzafaa	Take the time to take pics of them and the school and post on you tube. Watch your respond and help.|`|kyUiaDgyaa	What your little brother needs to learn to do is learn how to "Ignore" something that my mother taught me how to do when I was his age a long long long time ago, and I love that word "Ignore" a beautiful word in the English language. He needs to think MOM ( Mind Over Matter) your brother has a mind and those other knuckleheads out there should not matter to him. just tell your brother to ignore them not pay any attention to them|`|AA11988692	aww it feels nice that he has such a caring sister like you.  listen compliment your brother more, make him realize how great he is, figure out his talents and have him pursue them, etc.  first step should be to make him feel good.  maybe introduce him to more of ur friends so he has some more friends.....try to make him more confident. i know that this may be a more extreme case but everyone does get made fun of.  have him be able to deal with it.  try to make him react more cooly and naturally.  if u act like u dont care then bullies stop trying and prey on other people.  if u also keep acting nice and dont retaliate while standing up to yourself at the same time, then that should be ok too.  ive had my share of being bullied; i learned english and hindi at the same time so it was hard for me to speak well when i was little since i used to get confused and i used to be extremely quiet.  i made friends, reacted cooly and kept on being nice to the people who made fun of me they eventually gave up.      if the lice thing is the only thing going on, relax and do these things.  if not, and it gets worse just tell him to tell his teacher or ur mom will see which he would prefer to do.  good luck everything will work out|`|AA11635143	Well, first of all deal with the reason they are calling him Lice Mike.  Get rid of that bad hair gel and get the type that doesn't flake.  You are only a kid yourself and are in no position to deal with an issue that is this serious.    You told your Mom about it and she didn't do ANYTHING?  I hope she didn't just let it go and cast your brother to the wolves. Your parents need to pay a visit to his teacher, the school principle, and to the Board of Education and put a stop to the problem.  Your brother doesn't have to put up with that kind of crap out of a room full of brats and it needs to stop NOW.  He doesn't have to hide out in the library or some other place and not enjoy the same activities the rest of his class enjoys.    The telephone still works and if your mother can't get to school right away, at least she can make some calls and let them know she won't allow her son to be bullied another minute.    You seem to love your brother a lot so don't let this go until the problem is fixed.  God bless you for loving and caring.|`|AMSqpCxmaa	Treat the bully's like punching bags and demand respect!|`|e5bbc21bd805396768103a1ebd9ea78eaa	Jesus, talk to your parents. Find someone big or even pay him to talk to the guys. I would do it stright away. You both need to fight back. Repeatedly talk to his teacher and to your dad. Right now !|`|iupKQv1Maa	teach him how to scrap.|`|8HgvkFowaa	My little brother was the same way. He was kind of big for age (very tall) but very shy and gentle. Kids used to tease him about his stuttering and his awkwardness. In the sixth grade (and my brother entered the six grade just a week after turning eleven), some kid was teasing my brother about a girl he liked. He threatened to tell her, my brother panicked, shoved him (just pushed him), the kid went flying a few feet, but he learned not to pick on someone three times his size.  Your brother may not be a lot bigger, but if he learns to stand up for himself, the teasing will stop.   Telling an adult is correct in the 'technical' sense, but in reality, kids govern themselves in elementary school. Just like they do in middle school, and high school, and college, and life.|`|Sjf112pKaa	This is so sad! People used to call my little brother dumb all time cause hes dyslexic. Even other kids at church would....I just used intimidation to get them to stop making fun of him....    I would call the school myself if your mother won't, even if you are 14. Call the principal of the school, let them know that this is a problem. If the teachers are still allowing this to happen, go to the school district...nothing scares a teacher more than district involvement in their own classroom.|`|7PdmT2e6aa	Verbal Bullying is one of the Bullying considered to be more destructive than physical bullying, it targets the emotions of the person then makes it weaker inside thus making him/her very upset. In this cases one of the things you can do as a primary action is to make him turn his attention to other recreational games, by doing so his consciousness about the things that happens around him may decrease (e.g if something bad happens he will probably think about the feeling of doing the activity he wanted, thus making him forget it. On the contrary, if something good happens to him, he will probably be more happier because he will remember the feeling of being happy when he do things that he wanted).    If the primary action cannot resolve the problem, tell your parents to take action and face the prof/teacher and inform him that some of his classmates are bullying him, he might be a little embarrassed but it can greatly affect him.    If these actions are not taken, or not dealt seriously; only a matter of time is needed and you will certainly notice that he will become socially withdrawn.|`|aBziQhx2aa	You sound like a very caring older sister! I think you are right - your brother needs to tell his teacher and, most importantly, the principal about the abuse. Your suggestion to find new friends is also right on. As he finds a new group to belong to, hopefully the abuse won't be so stinging.     Your mom and brother may want to schedule a time to talk to the principal, his teacher and the school counselor all together. I'm sure if they know who are the sources of the teasing, they can arrange to separate your brother from them. My son went through a very similar thing. After we brought it to their attention, the school staff worked hard to help my boy find new friends. He's been great friends for 6 years with one of these "new" friends.     Good luck to your brother and your family!|`|UPD45e9Naa	i had the same prob when i was little i have a tumor in my left eye and had it since i was about 3 it is unoperable. but kids used to call me like cyclopse and pirate and other things like that. i found it best to ignore the assholes when they arnt in a big group like 2 or 3 kids like dont even pay attention to it but if it is a group i usally go along with it and say things that r funny and let the other assholes no that i really dont care wat they do but if he is getting ranked on for the lice mike thing try using hair spry it might not be as "cool" as gel but whose gonna no and it leaves no white stuff. but i would suggest that u dont go in no offence u r his older sister and that would make the other kids look down on him and say things but tell him its just elementary in middle school it got lot better and wasnt so many kids poking fun but there were a occational asshole that said something cause he thought he was a gangster or something but if u dont pay attention to it it will usallly go away and finding your own gorup even if it is 2 or 3 kids will cut down alot. i am 17 now and in high school and everyone nos me and my name and no one says anything any more and i got bunch of frineds now and go to partys and such. just tell him its gonna be alright its just a bunch of immature kids doin this and it will be a lot better in middle shcool. and he will evently find his own group. i hope this helps i also wouldnt suggest going to a teacher about it beacuse it would make him a snitch and it usally just gets worse if u do that if its that bad the teacher will find out on their own i hope this all helps and good luck|`|8qVkSA4jaa	Wow...I know how you feel.    My little brother is 11. Last year, he got picked on pretty badly. Some kids came over to him at lunch and poured his milk all over the table and took his food. One was his "FRIEND"!     When I found out what was going on, my heart broke. I couldn't believe someone could be so mean to my sweet little brother. Kids are so nasty! They can be so cruel.    I felt a little helpless. Thinking if I did anything about it, they could call him a baby. If I didn't, the bullying would continue.    I think my mom talked to the teacher, I can't really remember...but definitely encourage him to talk to the teacher and make sure she at least has her eye peeled for bullying behavior. AND talking to the kid's parents is a good idea. I don't think many parents want their kid treating other kids like that.    As much as you want to, don't punch the kids in the face. :) I wanted to so bad, but that could getcha into some trouble.    Anyway, good luck to you and your little brother. Make sure he knows how much you love him.|`|DkwgogXZaa	get him into some after school programs....he'll have fun.|`|IodpgIk7aa	you should talk to his teacher yourself, and the parents of the kids who are bullying him|`|88uIjItaaa	Tell a Parent or Adult.  If not and you take matter into your own hand slam the bullies face into a curb or sidewalk.|`|0udjgaoBaa	Give him things to say back to those mean kids, that will make other kids laugh. You need to have him stand up for himself as you know it gets harder the older you get...Dont have him run from his problems...Change his gel that might help too! If it was me Id go up the school and teach those kids a lesson im 5 yrs older than my brother and that's what I used to for him if he Absolutely couldn't handle it.|`|xQn3rR6Naa	It is time to contact the school, his teacher and the guidance counselor at that school. Someone should have noticed this is going on and if they haven't then they aren't doing what they are supposed to be doing, watching the kids.   Keep being there for your little brother, get him a different kind of gel that doesn't flake or get a different hair cut. Sometime the littlest things to change appearance can be a beginning of the way out. Right now he feels like nobody is in his corner and you have now thrown him a life line by telling him you care. Make sure you tell him about how you were excluded from something once. It will make him feel that he is not the only one who has had to endure this, and that you survived.   Make sure your parents take care of talking to the school however. No kid should have to fight his battles alone.
QTxdNavKaa	100% absolutely - you did the right thing and now he'll have no choice but to face the reality of his silly actions.    Who needs friends who can't take requests seriously? People like them are in their own world and your actions will wake him up.|`|uJDCoXH9aa	A tad overreaction... me thinks...|`|HZuLVEEsaa	Depends if you think you'll regret it later or not. What kind of friend is he normally? I think if theres any chance your gonna miss his friendship it wouldnt hurt to give him one last chance.|`|SaaQliNFaa	yes i think u were. Y r u doubting it?|`|332dd8467b31eeba85e0c5b0ec33f75aaa	Yes hes one of these blokes who sees every other man as a rival, therefore he will always try to take any girl you are seeing, its embedded in his personality, talking to him will do no good, maybe ten years therapy would do it, but you cant wait that long!!|`|MzP52FsBaa	It's not right for him to flirt with your girlfriend. And then say that it was just light hearted fun. He should have been saying sorry. I think you made the right choice because that's not very friend like and he upset your girlfriend.|`|XTy7mLAkaa	Sometimes the season is over with certain friends.  It's acceptable, what you did.  I know you feel bad about it but don't.  He's no good for you to be around anymore especially if he's crackin' on your girl.  You all may hook up again later in life but for now, he's getting in the way.|`|ouIZdXdaaa	yeah|`|gmaCvh00aa	I think so.  A good friend who really cared about you wouldn't flirt with your girlfriend just for a joke.    Chances are he is jealous that you have a nice relationship and he doesn't, but once again, a real friend is happy for you, not trying to sabotage what you have.    It's sad, but I've learned over the years that there are going to be people who served a purpose in your life at one point but who are just dragging you down at another, and it's best just to break ties and move on.    I had a friend once who always called me her best friend, and supposedly she is all sorts of hurt over me cutting ties with her after my divorce--but on the night I got my official divorce, she and her husband had my ex over for dinner to celebrate.  I do not regret getting rid of this person.|`|ACVKajUIaa	if you are asking this question then u clearly regret it|`|ONQpHeycaa	Yes - regretting what you did doesn't mean it wasn't the right thing to do.  Flirting with your girlfriend to the point where even SHE'S irritated is a pretty big deal.  He didn't respect you guys, and who needs a friend like that anyway?    If in a few weeks/months you really miss him...then maybe just YOU can hang out with him and tell him you're not comfortable with him around your GF.  Try keeping him away and just have guy time with him and tell him he's not welcome on dates and trips you take with YOUR girlfriend.|`|NPtz1Y4Taa	yes there is time to be funny but he didn't listen or take the hint , so he wouldnt think twice about trying to steel your girl friend or mess your relation ship with her up.    maureen
p3AbTmbfaa	Being confrontational is hard for a some people because they generally do not like to be the bad guy or make waves; so rather than upsetting someone they tolerate others negative actions and behavior. Some do so for such a long time they get used to living with the problem and instead of referring to it as a problem, they refer to it as "Just the way things are." For most of us though, we put up with negative actions only until the pain becomes unbearable, and then we finally snap. At this point rather than approaching the situation in a calm and collected way, we usually blow up, become super defensive and come off sounding and acting more like Freddy Kruger than a kind caring person wanting to correct a bad situation. Some people blow up and call the divorce lawyer, some run away, some get physical, some even quit their jobs. On the reverse side, those who avoid confrontation can be sometimes found covering up their problems with drugs, (legal or illegal) Alcohol or they may avoid the problem by throwing themselves into their work or hobbies. Some even fabricate a fantasy world of make believe and live in denial, ignoring reality.    Confrontation is always a healthy action as long as it brings with it, love, grace, understanding, wisdom and growth. Below are 7 rules for successful confrontation.    Rule number one: Don't wait!    As soon as you realize something is a problem address it at the first opportune time. People want to confront their problems but they don't want to talk with people. It can't be done. Will you hate it? Probably; but do it anyway because you will hate it tomorrow, next week, next month and next year, so why wait. The longer you wait the more damage you allow to occur, the more pressure you build up inside and the greater chance you have of losing your temper and responding poorly, thus causing an argument. Besides, if a person is doing something wrong, would it be right to allow them to continue to do so? Of course not. Also, address the problem in person not via letter or email. The written word is too impersonal and can easily be misinterpreted. Lastly; If you have the problem, YOU go and address it, don't send a friend or co-worker who could care less, they will only make you out to be the bad guy anyway.         Rule number two: Do it for them.    Approach the one causing the problem for their benefit not your own. If the problem is upsetting you, in most cases that behavior is also hurting other people as well as their reputation. Approach the person with the mindset that you are there to help them, not hurt them. Come across positive. Nobody likes to be told they are wrong, bad, or poor at something but everyone is open to become a better person. Make sure they feel as though you sincerely have their best intentions at heart, not your own selfish desires.         Rule Number three: Don't bring backup'    When you have to confront someone, don't bring backup unless you need to. No one likes to feel as though they are being ganged up on. As a matter of fact, tell as few people about the problem as possible. If you run all over the place gossiping about another persons problems without confronting them, YOU are causing conflict. Bringing a bunch of folks with you to prove a point only shows that you care more about proving yourself right than you do how that person feels. Remember; even though the problem may affect you, it is not about you, its about them. Treat them the way you want to be treated when you do something wrong.    If you have taken all the proper steps yourself and they still ignore your advice, then bring one other person with you to backup your position. Just make sure they are a person the offender respects and that they too will also come across in a caring way.    (In the times when you must have someone present in order to discuss certain topics or for your own protection, use judgment in who you select to be the witness.)         Rule Number four: Start with Praise    Always make the person feel good before you give them some news that may make them feel bad. It shows you care. If you have a person that is always late, you can say something along the lines of: "Jimmy, I really appreciate all the hard work you have been doing lately, it really shows. Tomorrow when you get here on time I would like to see how you pull it off". If Jimmy comes in late again you can then go up to him and say, "Hey Jimmy, I noticed you haven't been able to make it here on time lately and I am worried about your upcoming review, is there anything I can help you with?" By letting Jimmy know you care about him, he will be more apt to listen to what you have to say without getting defensive.    As another example lets say your spouse Jimmy is spending very little time with the children. Based on past experience you know that if you say anything about it an argument will start. So instead of confronting him with a caring loving attitude you wait and suppress the anger until one day|`|4w9gmvumaa	It's called the art of cross-examination: http://www.thefederation.org/documents/P...|`|DZB0WCmmaa	with a tank.    when you get angry enough, you'll find a way yourself.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	I would just approach up to them and say, "Can I talk to you something important"?|`|aOjMf5SPaa	Right, from the get go, get the right moment, no friends, but friends in ear shot is good. Tell it as is. You did this. it was horrible. you can not accept people to concede you are a good person. with what you did you caused this. it is important you know so that you learn and hopefully do not make another life horrible.   thank you.|`|PBuYKm8Aaa	The best way that I have found is just be really really nice about it:    In the nicest voice say something like.  "So i know you lied about _______. It would be nice to know why you said something like that about me, knowing that it is untrue. If you would like to give me an answer that would be nice, but if not...."    then add something like this if their suppose to be your friend:  "then i don't know yet if i can be friends with someone who is going to try to hurt me like that. I wouldnt do that to you."     Or    If their not:  "then for now on just please keep to yourself and ill keep to mine. No harm no foul"      I used that all through high school. It worked for me every time.

But its ok, next time I will know, and I just can't loan you money again. No hard feelings though, and Oh, yea, Nice jacket, mustve costed a grip =) Then you walk away and leave them with their mouth open lmfaoooo|`|JSMkxwrbaa	With a knife?
Z3a1cRL7aa	While the answers above do make sense, I have a different insight.  Being a man, and having proposed, when I was ready to propose I spoke far less about it than I had previously.  The reason that I didn't say as much about it, was because I didn't want to tip my girl off that I was going to be popping the question.  It could be that he is ready to ask you and doesn't want you to be suspecting it.

Although what tends to happen is women "area" isnt meant to handle that much friction for that long so after about 30 to hour, it doesnt feel as good and by then they either got "theirs" off already or they are ready for you to get off of  them. And sometimes its painfull the next day. As for a guy, i like to have sex alot but sometimes its just takes alot of energy. And people dont get orgasms like the movies.

Intercourse (for us) lasts about 1-2 hours; because we   take our time and make sure that each other is   thoroughly satisfied.|`|LGHMmRVFaa	because somtimes you cant because the girl could be on her period and she could be worn out from the other night|`|IOgVthDHaa	K|`|7xoMXSEqaa	Lack of a partner willing.|`|Zz4YoCOkaa	They don't do it everyday because the might not have time or they get  home tired. It depends i could be hours or just minutes.|`|hIwJxNVkaa	well dude... the male reproductive system can only really withstand about three days straight of sex. if you do more.. well.. lets not go their.. but how long it takes? depending on the person... they have diffrent endurance.. some men can last longer than others..|`|DKyV5CU1aa	lets see who really would say that they do it everyday??!?! right someone will think that your some kind of pervert,  how long do you want it to last. .. thats how long,|`|m9dJH32Taa	1. Sex isn't quite as exciting once you've been having it with the same person for many years.    2. Life gets in the way. Kids, bills, errands, housework. Other things to focus on.    3. Intercourse alone is usually only say 5 to 15 minutes. The whole thing from the first kiss to the end should take about 1 hour.|`|mbv2jLqDaa	Some people lead very busy lives and don't have time to have sex everyday.  There are other way to show affection than just sex.  Having it everyday seems to take away from the specialness of it all.  Intercourse can last from 10 minutes to hours...it really depends.  Sometimes my boyfriend and I go for 3 hours  or more and never notice the time!|`|O46f8wl3aa	There are plenty of reasons a person who absolutely loves sex will not have it on any given night. Maybe they don't feel good, maybe they're tired, maybe they had a long day and would just rather not... I could go on and on!     And the length of intercourse can take as little as 2 mins all the way up to hours. It all depends on the people involved.|`|vIiG3NILaa	Well, people don't have sex for various reasons. i love my husband and he's great in bed but sometimes we'll go for like a whole week without sex. either because i had a long day at the office, or i have a head ache or i'm annoyed with him or just because i don't feel like it. But really, he's never said no to me even when he was SUPER mad at me. (that was great) But as wonderful as sex is, it can take time and time isn't always there.     sex times are anywhere from 15 minutes (first thing in the morning) or all night. depending on how much time there is and how long its been since the last time.|`|AA12199454	obviously you are not married.  most young men usually in their teens to early twenties are under the impression that when they marry or live alone away from mom and dad, they can freely engage in sex every day. that might last a little while. then the novalty wears off. especially when one partner ends up with an irritation of the genitals.  trust me, i've been married to the same woman for over forty years, absense makes the heart grow fonder.  as for the second part of your question, some people like it hot and heavy and some like it slow and easy.  the main thing is to try to remain compatable through experimentation.  treat your partner as an equal and you may end up with a partner for life. very few things are more rewarding and i haven't even begun to tell you about children and grandchildren.
6J8sHGRIaa	-Watch a movie  -Walk around a zoo  -Hang out at the mall  -Go bowling or skating  -Go to lunch or dinner with him  -Play/walk at the park    Wherever you are with him, talk to him more and (not too noticeably) sit next to him and you might want to flirt a "little". If you hug him, don't just hug him with a friendly "pat", hold him a little longer than usual. Kissing? I think just a peck would be cute and modest. DON'T BE A ****. Flirt with him to turn him on but play "hard-to-get" (but not TOO hard to get, ok?).    Since you're at the park, you could play with him on the swings, and have fun on little kid's rides! But if it's just a walking park, just walk and talk with him... and talk about something usual (but if you want, you could talk about something different in order to not bore him).      Good Luck and Have fun on your date with him! =D|`|dv0zbH7gaa	Men are visual then women in general and therefore any sexual movements are a turn on. Also when kissing go left. This is a personal thing but every girlfriend I have always goes right. Maybe its me being stupid but still you can always give it a try its not going to do any harm. O and hugging tip is to put your arms above his. It lets him get in a more of a sexual orientated position! Hope this helps and good luck!|`|xEDnhoI2aa	well the kissing and hugging will just feel natural to you once you get it started...and are you sure you want to be turning him on just now...just the kissing and letting him feel you is enough to get him turned on..and if you mean really turned on then i say just use your hands and rub the right spots that will turn him on and good.|`|OydWDKcAaa	Punch him in the balls.  He'll love you forever.  Maybe suck on his balls to warm them up before the punch.|`|InDloXSAaa	whenever you hug him, hug him like it will be the last time you see eachother.
2oXy22pvaa	"I knew somethin was strange about you! :P"    Nah, seriously, i'd find it kinda weird if he did but whatever he wants. Seriously, I KNOW he tried on my dresses and stuff :P Cause we used to play dress up. We're close in age. He's just 2 years younger. I used to paint his nails and he's be completely ok with it. When I did my hair he'd ask me to do his too. I think it was just cause he didn't want to be left out. He used to look up to me a lot, he'd cry if I wasn't around. He wanted to do stuff with me, even if was girly.    Seriously.. I'd probably ask/say..  "since when?"  "who else knows?"  "uhh... why?"  "k.. so why are you telling me?"  "erm.. that's kinda uhhh strange"  "uhuh.. well good luck with that"  "so what, are you actually gay or something?"    I'd be in general ok with it, a little weirded by it. It depends on the sister.|`|7z8S9GvBaa	I mean I would be taken back, But i wouldn't stop loving him, I mean Being a crossdresser doesn't change the person he is, Just don't ask like why do you like cross dressing it makes them feel bad.|`|IP2suWFTaa	I wouldn't judge him.I'd treat him like I always have ,but I would warn him about how others would react if they found out.|`|sW8VQy4Qaa	I would ask why he felt that way and what i could do to help him and try to understand him and be totally cool with it [i have a sis thats a lesbian so im more open minded] but.. I don't think i would give him my clothes because he could ruin them with mustard stains!|`|ZaMzRSrraa	I would be shocked..but at least I would know who was going thru my things,     I would ask if you are  a homosexual  I would ask if you told anyone else  I would ask how long have you been doing this/where/when???  I would ask what does it feel like for yu to dress like a girl?  I would ask what do you feel is missing that you have to dress like a girl.( emotionally  mising)  I would ask if he wishes he was born a girl  I would ask him if he likes girls/boys and in what way  I would ask him to ask to wear my clothes  I would ask if he ever intends to go out in public that way  so many questions    I would ask if he was jealous of me|`|yfG0t5Glaa	idk|`|8ACdEaC5aa	dont be mad at your bro... just accept it|`|JSMkxwrbaa	I'd say 'urgh'.|`|0Sk6uFQRaa	accept him,as long as he does not mess with my clothes  it's not a big deal to me.but then,2 of my older brothers are gay|`|wQz9qybgaa	Well I dont have a brother. But my cousin did that same thing. I mean when you tell your sister this she is going to be pretty shocked unless you haven;t really tired to keep a secret.    I would be prepared for her to ask you if you are gay   How long its been going on  Maybe why you feel the need to do it      Good luck|`|K5Ntj67kaa	If your brother confessed something to you like that it means that he trust you and he knows that you are someone who won't criticize him for his decision. Ask whatever is on your mind. But be supportive... if that is what he chooses than that is his decision and you need to be the one who won't judge him and just treat him like you would if he had never told you. You don't want to say something that may hurt him, because then he will never trust you again.|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	I would hope I would be loving and supportive as I would hope that my sibling would be for me in any situation.  However, depending on what age you are, you may get a different reaction.  For instance, I know my eleven year old son would be endlessly teased by his 14 yr old sister.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	She will kick your sissy butt and make you wash all of her clothes.

3scyTmjCaa	I'm going through a similar relationship with a girl, even though she doesn't live far away. If he really loves you, I don't think he's showing you too well. You shouldn't have to try if it is love. He probably should be calling you almost as much as you call him. Don't let him use gender as an excuse, guys don't always have to be lazy, a lot of us just choose to. Next time you see him in person you might want to tell him how you feel about this situation if you haven't already.|`|4LYasBGXaa	becasue sex is a very important part of the relationship-    it is the physical manifestation of your intimacy, without which you are just friends.      some people don't like to talk on the phone- maybe he doesn't.    there is no "should or should not" be offended, if you are say something.    perhaps you two just have different sex drives and maybe that is something you need to resolve or indicative of other issues that need to be resolved. maybe they are minor, maybe not- better to find out than sweep it under the rug and have it blow up in your face later.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	...we guys are generally all up and about sex sweet sister...so you really shouldn't honestly be all that surprised....are you?...LOL!!!.

This guy is already anticipating wonderfully sensual and special moments with you darlin.  He's just planting the mental seeds for you obviously...can you feel the seeds growing?  Cut him some little slack anyways,....cuz he's horny for you sister....and that's a GOOD thing darlin...not a bad thing alternatively......wouldn't you agree?  Have a great spring and summer darlin.

xnPjfYrvaa	So you feel like marriage is naturally the next step because you are living together, is that it?  Don't push, just be honest then leave it alone.    Tell him how you feel (about living together and marriage), but just tell him to listen.  Tell him, you're not proposing, but you didn't want to hold in what you were feeling.  I personally think that is something he needs to know.    You could say something like:    "Listen, I love you and I want a future together.  I think we made a mistake by moving in together.  I think we should reconsider that.  My thoughts are that I want marriage in the future and I would like to wait for that before we live together."      I don't know.  I hope that helps some.  Good luck!

You are yourself. and be proud of that.
B9tdcrykaa	It's normal. I'm assuming your mom raised you, so SHE is the one who is your parent.  Being a sperm donor does not give a man the right to be a father. Apparently he can't even take care of himself so he has no business trying to take care of you.  Talk to your real parent about the situation and just know that he gave up the right to be your dad by bailing and then getting himself thrown in jail. Once he gave up that right, he lost his right to tell you what to do in your life.|`|gjdd7bVWaa	Sure.  Be as mad as you want.

8qVkSA4jaa	I'd be upset, too. Tell her how you feel and that you really had your heart set on Jayden.    If she refuses, you can name your baby Jayden, too...or find a better name.    Being your sister, I really hope she would understand how you feel and give you your name back.|`|ZEhGBBMUaa	dont make them both jaydens. its kinda weird. i think just let it go cause it would be really stupid to ruin the relationship u have with your sister because of a name. wish u all the best.|`|gPlUDaRoaa	Girl,just let it go.Until she actually has the baby and names it stop stressing over it.Yeah it would be messed up if she were to name her kid Jayden and then you were to have another one and also name it Jayden.In fact that would be down right crazy.There are millions of names out there and you are getting yourself all worked up over one of them.By the time you do have another kid you may like another name.If you do find another name you really like,don't tell anyone what it is,then you won't have to worry about anyone "stealing"your name it's as simple as that.Oh,and btw Jayden could be a boy or a girls name,but don't tell your sister that.lol|`|M8fQiTsqaa	hun itl be silli if you have 2 jaydens    let it go bbe or call urs brandon lol    its probly her hormones playin up..;plus who knws?    she myt have a girl ;) x|`|Sjf112pKaa	Sure name your kid Jayden. It would be even better if he was cuter than your sisters kid whose name is also Jayden.     So which jayden is that?    "Oh the cute Jayden" = your child    it would be funny and it would make your sister mad cause her son would be the not as cute jayden.    Or just think of a better name and not tell her.|`|Vn7BEsslaa	I think you should talk with your sister about how you feel about her using the name that you suggested to her a few months back.

2b0a3200c0db672cf39c688cc41d456caa	Maybe she has some sort of illness that she hasn't told you about, and she's trying to break the ice.  Talk to her about it - ask if she's feeling okay.  Tell her that she's upsetting you with this, and that you would like to talk to her about it.

IM HOLDING ON YOUR ROPE GOT ME 10 FEET OFFF THE GROUNDDDDD|`|z5M8xfhXaa	Try saying sorry to her if you have done anything.|`|gb9REJN4aa	She's not being evil, though she is being odd. It occurs to me that she might be really ill and not sure how to tell you.    How to make her stop? Easy. I know you're 16 and this will be weird, but you have to sit down with her and tell her it is freaking you out. Tell her you're worried that she might be ill (if you are) or depressed (if you are) or whatever worries you about it, and that while you're aware she's going to die one day it bothers you that she seems obsessed by it.    That will be one heck of an awkward conversation. But if you can kind of be the grown-up here--weird, I know--she'll probably tell you what's up, and if nothing is up but her trying to give you perspective, then she'll probably stop when she sees it has worked pretty darned well.|`|ouXbJLbOaa	Tell her to stop, its not rite what shes doing. if she doesn't stop, sing the songs with her and ignore the emails, that'll make her think that you don't care about what shes trying to say. then she'll stop because it wont be fun for her anymore.|`|GGpkMLwUaa	Awww, sweetheart, I'm really sorry. I think you should talk to a family friend or school counciler about this, maybe even confront your mom.

Maybe she had a mammogram and is waiting on the results or something along those lines.

Or maybe she is just stressed out at work and doesn't have all her marbles together. Stress does funny things.    Best Option: Confront her and ask her what is going on, I don't think her intent is one of malice.|`|Vm0iVpYPaa	She is probably going through the menapours chick don't worry all there emotions are everywhere.

Tell her that the way she is acting is as if she is expecting to dye tomorrow and it is really creeping/worrying you.

Tell her what she is saying to you is making you feel bad or sad. Communication is key in any type of relationship. You are still young so it is important for you and your mom understand each other. If she continues to do this, she may have sort of depression and it is important for you to tell someone in your family about what is happening. Hang in there and good luck. I hope this helped you!|`|O46f8wl3aa	Sounds like she's depressed about something, possibly feeling under appreciated. There is nothing you can do to make her stop unfortunatley...

gojp0iFRaa	There are a number of medical and psychological issues that could be causing your inability to orgasm. Without being examined by a physician, it's impossible to narrow it down. I would recommend making an appointment with your family physician, and he can refer you to more specialized assistance if you need it. It could be as simple as needing to relax, or possibly due to a problem with bloodflow. Definitely go get it checked out if it is seriously affecting you.|`|7z8S9GvBaa	Same with me but i am a female, It takes me about 45minutes, and my boyfriend 10, He say's i am having sex with another man, But am not.

oEDT7cqRaa	Okay everyone who is telling her that shes too young to have sex, its her decision NOT yours! Okay sex basically is a way to reproduce when the man inserts his penis into the woman's vagina. Both the man and woman can do most of the work. But they both have a very big part in it lol. If you are a virgin (never had sex before) it hurts a lot. Your hymen is inside your vagina and many different things can cause it to break. When it breaks there can be blood. If the woman is on the bottom (generally) she just basically just pushes her lower body towards the man's "area" and the man basically humps her and his part is harder. Generally being on top is a harder job and is much more tiring because they have more work to do. I cannot stand how if you ask a question, people always criticize you instead of answer your question. I'm 14 so its good that you're asking. Be sure to always practice safe sex (birth control or condoms). Condoms are a MUST! Good luck and be safe! :)|`|Q5y9CJ02aa	u r to younge to have sex   its hurts like hell the first time and u can bleed|`|Q5FYrU9vaa	Your too young if i tell you u might do it..

However, I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife, except on account of fornication, makes her a subject for adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. (Mt 5:31, 32) Also, after telling the Pharisees that the Mosaic concession of divorcing their wives was not the arrangement that had prevailed from the beginning, Jesus said: I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except on the ground of fornication, and marries another commits adultery. (Mt 19:8, 9) Today, generally, distinction is made between fornicators and adulterers. According to modern usage, those guilty of fornication are unmarried persons who willingly have sexual relations with someone of the opposite sex. Adulterers are married persons who willingly have sexual relations with a member of the opposite sex who is not their legal marriage mate. As shown in the article FORNICATION, however, the term fornication is a rendering of the Greek word porneia and includes all forms of illicit sexual relations outside of Scriptural marriage. Hence, Jesus words at Matthew 5:32 and 19:9 mean that the only divorce ground that actually severs the marriage bond is porneia on the part of ones marriage mate. The follower of Christ may avail himself of that divorce provision if that is his desire, and such a divorce would free him to marry an eligible Christian.1Co 7:39.    Sexually immoral acts committed by a married person with someone of the same sex (homosexuality) are filthy and disgusting. Unrepentant persons of this type will not inherit Gods Kingdom. And, of course, bestiality is Scripturally condemned. (Le 18:22, 23; Ro 1:24-27; 1Co 6:9, 10) These grossly filthy acts come under the broad designation porneia. It is also noteworthy that, under the Mosaic Law, homosexuality and bestiality carried the death penalty, freeing the innocent mate for remarriage.Le 20:13, 15, 16    Jesus Christ pointed out that everyone that keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. (Mt 5:28) But Jesus did not say that what was in the heart, but not carried into action, furnished a basis for divorce. Christs words show that the heart should be kept clean and one should not entertain improper thoughts and desires.Php 4:8; Jas 1:14, 15.    Nothing is said in the Scriptures that would permit a Christian to divorce a marriage partner because that one was physically unable to perform the marital act, or had gone insane or contracted an incurable or loathsome disease. The love that Christians are to show would call, not for divorce, but for merciful treatment of such a mate. (Eph 5:28-31) Nor does the Bible grant Christians the right to divorce their marriage mates because of difference in religion; it shows instead that by remaining with an unbelieving mate the Christian may win that individual over to the true faith.1Co 7:12-16; 1Pe 3:1-7.      A single person who commits fornication with a prostitute makes himself one body with that person. Similarly, the adulterer makes himself one body, not with his legal wife, but with the immoral person with whom he has sexual relations. The adulterer thus sins not only against his own personal flesh but also against his legal wife who until then has been one flesh with him. (1Co 6:16-18) For that reason adultery provides a true basis for breaking the marital bond in accord with divine principles, and where such ground exists, a divorce obtained brings about the formal and final dissolution of the legal marriage union, free|`|HhmhSBpgaa	try to figure out what might be the problem. if you have no sex or bad sex it is 100% of the marriage if you have great sex it is 10% iof the marriage as the old saying goes. encourage her to get some help.

That's what make a relationship. So of course you need to stand by him. He's doing all the right things here. He's TRYING. God bless him. I hope you'll continue to support him and get yourselves through this difficult time that a lot of people are going through right now. Remember>>it won't last forever. This is a test for many people in relationships right now. And we all need to stand by each other with love and support. Good luck. Stay strong and I wish you and your family the best!!!!!!|`|AA11309717	First, If you were in his position, would you want support from him? Second, If you were him, would still want his unconditional love? I'm sure buried underneath all that stress he wants the 2 of you to have that "spark" again as well. Stress does funny things to people. He's tired all the time because the stress makes him run all day and then when it comes time to wind down at night he can't because the stress still has hold of him. Find the time to console him, find the time to hold him and tell him everything between the 2 of you is ok. He not only needs to feel your support he needs to hear your support and to be re assured that you aren't going away as well. As far as the remedy for what ails the 2 of you, there isn't any but what I've explained to you.     Please just love him, hold him and tell him it's all gonna be ok and that he doesn't need to worry about the 2 of you. When things get to be better for him, things will be better for the 2 of you as well and that's when you will reap the rewards of being loving, loyal and patient.      Good Luck!|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	it is totally depending on you and your tolerance. yes it is normal for him to feel the way he does and be stressed. you can stick out and be with him if you feel it is worth it or you can move on.|`|HhmhSBpgaa	Be very supportive He is going through a difficult time right now. All that is very hard on a mans ego. Just try to be understanding and that will help him out more than you know. He has a lot of things on his mind right now.|`|CmZ2cLIqaa	When my husband usually is in such a funk, I usually baby him. I make him his favorite foods, give him massages and offer anything he wants. Maybe choose a weekend where both of you can just go out for the weekend, somewhere random. Just get in the car and go where the road leads you. Have fun, and get his mind off of all the troubles of everyday..|`|AA11180444	When he says he's just not into it means that he is just too mentally exhausted to delve all he has into it.  Don't take it personally.  His heart may not be into alot of things.  Give him space but also be there for him.  Maybe he just doesn't want to hear advice or whatever.  He might need some medication for depression but it's hard to get some people to admit they have a problem.  Sounds like he has a good grip on life and all things at hand, so let him do what he has to do. Just let him know that and that you love him.  Give lots of hugs.  Physical touch (not necessarily sexually) is proven to help depression or mood swings.|`|xR5d6Zuwaa	I believe that you should try to give him a little space. Maybe he doesn't accept the fact his financial status is not what it used to be. Men don't cope with things as well as women does. We are more accepting to certain situation and at least we can talk about it. Just try to understand wheres he's coming from. Many people feel the same way in this recession crisis.|`|rcut6bhoaa	You had BETTER support him!       He is doing everything he possibly can to make sure things are ok for his family.|`|4boTYkt7aa	This is a good time to get closer.So what if he doesn't feel like having sex,there is so much more to supporting each other.Hold him and let him know that you love him.Sex is not important when someone has so much pressure on them.Can't you show him love from your heart?|`|5k7BexD3aa	Normal?  What do you think?  An almost 50 percent pay cut--well that right there is a kick in the teeth.  It sounds like he is busting his hump to get things accomplished.  Give him time.|`|Bc4udMhUaa	I think his behavior is normal given the circumstances. Give him space and support. Push you feelings aside with the knowledge you need to support him in this hard time and things will get better.
d5W2hDGsaa	I mean a shirt want hurt as long as it is not expensive and it looks nice, just in case the dating do not last as long( but hopefully i hope so) ,and  at least you did something nice for him and he did too. Also at the same time it did not cost a lot so whats the lost. GO FOR IT..
gjdd7bVWaa	Talk to your parents, grandparents, and anyone else in the extended family.  Try making a family tree.  You could try internet searches, but most of those aren't free and may not be very reliable.  Go through photo albums and ask about anyone you don't know.
WMR8hVlfaa	They mean something different to everyone. The reason they are called promise rings is that they usually come with a promise of some kind - some people give them as a promise of love, others as a promise of marriage, etc.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	just a cheap ring that is giving signifying to you that i promise to only go out with you. most guys give their class rings to their girl friend instead of buying one for her. a girl wearing this signifies to others, that she is taken.|`|ByUS0k8waa	it pretty much means you don't really want to marry the person. A lil FYI anyone who has ever got or given a promise ring has ended badly. It pretty much means you don't want to marry them yet but maybe one day.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	A promise ring is a symbol that two people are in love and intend to get engaged and married. It is usually a way for a guy to get his girlfriend to stop complaining baout getting engaged, it is a way to get out of it and put it off for some tiem.|`|AA11138696	Don't really mean much.  It is more like a going stead ring than an engagement.  Many girls have fallen for that mistake, the Pre engagement ring thing and gone to bed with their "fiance" when they would not sleep with their boyfriend.  The promise the ring represents is only as good as the word of the one who give it.|`|MYbRICxqaa	A few years ago, a lot of people did not know promise rings. Promise rings are great to give to someone special in your life. My boyfriend gave me one about four years ago. For me it meant that our relationship was moving to the next level and it has.|`|8c535adab7e1972d8d073a1e23ab28c1aa	I use to give them out like candy, it makes it easier to get into her pants.    At one time I had 6 rings out at once.    For me, a promise ring means I care about you enough to make you feel special and make you assume we have a future, just so I can get you to sleep with me, but I don't care enough about you to go all the way with an engagement ring.|`|n1s9jbnNaa	Theoretically they mean your promising yourself to that person. Usually promise rings are given when your younger in place of an engagement ring.|`|BNNy90Aiaa	buying time   mildred sent me|`|zspVPoLZaa	i c it as when a dude really likes you and uve been in a relationshio for a long time, its like a pre weding ring if ur young, like im 15 and i want my boyfriend to give me 1, its like saying ime here for you always, illl never hurt you and never leave you, and ill love you forever!! i want one so bad!!!! lol
gjdd7bVWaa	1)  I'm fairly certain someone will notice.  2)  At your age, you'll be considered a runaway and they'll be looking for you to bring you back.  3)  Don't be stupid and post where you want to go on the internet for anyone to find, whether it be before or after you leave.  Don't you think your parents might get a clue to check the things you've said and done on the internet after you're gone?  4)  You've got 2 years.|`|M8fQiTsqaa	eyy dnt be so silli  no u dnt    its wrng    u need family|`|npA75Obvaa	Wait untill your legally an adult, then you can do anything you want.|`|hYZIYla0aa	Don't do anything to hurt your family that badly,do you really think moving here is the answer?Who is going to take care of you? We don't have free medical coverage here,And forget about a real job.Are you ready to live on welfare and be homeless? What do you know about being a citizen of the USA? It isn't any better here then there.
nxh8xxQvaa	He's testing the waters. Don't be nervous! He's looking for a response. Perhaps he'll want to get together with you soon. Just make sure that he's understanding that you are shy, so that he won't pressure you. Good luck with your endeavors.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	He definitely likes you.|`|5fUaqBnwaa	Oh yeas...he's you're love slave.|`|AbQCkNHuaa	It sounds like he does like you! (yay)! Well he probably is not doing anything because when you guys use to like each other, you didn't want to date. So maybe you should make the move. A shy turtle always has to come out of it's shell. I wish you luck!|`|ZBnvveT3aa	that a total yes. he's just shy just like you if you start to have some feelings for him and all these things keep going on dont be afarid to make the first move. if you go for youll never know what might happen ... i been in this sort of situation twice and it has worked out for me|`|4hkM3HXyaa	It sounds like he's waiting on you to make the move. Maybe you should just ask him. I know, being shy that might seem impossible, but if you like him and want something to happen....then go for it!|`|SpCihawgaa	i do think he likes u, so make a move, sometime the guy is thinking the same as u and is shy to.|`|A13xffyFaa	he likes you and as you are scared giving any response he must be scared of telling you that. i do like one girl and i told her for friendship and i got confused face that's all and nothing else.
143bm6cnaa	Pick your battles.  Let the little ones go, but stand up for really, really important things.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	First of all, it's spelled "fight". Are you 12 or something? Why is it so hard for you to just shut up and listen to your mother?|`|tJ6N1IyZaa	Quit being an *** to her and be her daughter grow up a bit more and be a young lady|`|NPtz1Y4Taa	think why your getting so mad is it really worth losing your temper just count to 10 and go do something else|`|gebIjqnWaa	You need to respect your Mom because your Mom knows best. Later in life you will see that it's all for your own good. I didn't see eye to eye with my Mom either when I was a teenager, but now that I'm older it's clear that what she was doing was for my benefit. I thought she was whipping me because she hated me, but I was wrong.
NSKimt1Qaa	Your wife sounds very impressionable.  If Boris from Russia lived next door she'd be speaking Russian and eating Russian Borscht and tea cakes and rinsing it down with vodka.  Nah, this doesn't mean she's having an affair, but she might have a crush. ; )    Vegemite doesn't sound too good. Is it an acquired taste?|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Possibly, but she would be pretty stupid to make it that obvious.    I'd guess she is just infatuated by the novelty of him being the new neighbour.|`|Lb6Y7xlnaa	L0L!.. ok, i shouldn't be laughing...   First of all, you need to ask your wife how she feels about that BRAD character. Just ask her to be honest. You need to take pre-cautions as to whats going on and don't let this STRANGER ruin YOUR marriage. If you have to go over there, in a CALM manner and speak with him then do so. If he is NOT married himself, you need to let him know that she is yours and the relationship is not going anywhere. Meaning its not about to end because of him or anybody else.   If he is inviting her over there, or she is inviting herself, YOU need to be present. No married woman needs to be calling a neighbor like that or pretending to speak a certain way.. You need to ask her why she's doing that... let her know you've noticed some changes in her and that you feel somewhat confused because this is NOT her true character.     Just be alert and don't sit back and allow things to happen that can be stopped or prevented...  Hope it works out|`|RcCJSSMPaa	LUCKY!!! Brad used to be my neighbor!|`|SBBnWsJJaa	What's an "affect"?|`|6aVtiTKiaa	It doesn't matter.  Serving Vegemite is grounds for divorce in itself.  Get away while you still can.    EDIT:    You know, this isn't good advertising for your private investigating services ... :)|`|8nGZV6ufaa	Sounds like ya got yourself a bit ov a problem, mate.   She definatly has been "studying" the culture!!!  You know what I'm thinking on this one, I am sure.  Take care.
YfFFzOw1aa	Aww Maya that wonderful, so sweet. As you know i have no experience in this but when guys ask me out and i don't feel the same, i tell them that (corny line coming) I am happy to be single and that friendship with them is good enough for me, if they don't understand then they are not worth it.   If you feel that you would like to marry him one day but not so soon then tell him that you want to concerntrate on other things for a while and maybe in time you can get together. i hope this helps babes. xx|`|iwE1QRKdaa	Turn him down sweetly, or accept it and say you will after your studies|`|jK5FXm6Naa	How could someone propose to you without going out with you first? That's really odd.  All you can do is make him very sure he knows what you want and be careful not to slip up around him. He'll get over it eventually|`|e160ceb9ca2ffde0eeab6549e5c41f80aa	Honesty.|`|yULWldR4aa	Tell him at the moment the timing isnt right, who knows what the future holds but for now you want to concentrate on your studies and yourself.    I'm sure he will understand.|`|yuv6YUo3aa	honestly tell him
1L1AxWoXaa	I think it is a cop out. A way to get around being openly racist. I live in a very racially diverse area. I grew up with a lot of mixed nationality people. None of them had a harder time than someone who was not multi-ethnic. Kids are mean. Doesn't matter what it is there is going to a bully that pokes at your weaknesses. If you are sensitive about being biracial than that is what they are going to make fun of. If you let it roll than the bully will pick something else.|`|3ggolLgQaa	I think this race issue is crap.    I am Kurdish (Middle eastern) and people think I must have it SO hard but I don't. Its not because people are not racist to me, they are, but I just dnt care.    I think if you truly feel proud of who you are, you will not be offended by racist people.    EDIT**  Just look at my name lool that explains it all! :D|`|NrwJyffxaa	I'm sure you know by now how cruel kids are.  The last thing they need is something to add fuel to their fires.      I think it has become alot more acceptable in the last 20 years but still has a long way yet to go.  We are still very racist, certain areas are more so then others.  I think some of the funniest jokes and commedie routines are very racist but I still laugh at them so I guess I'm a racist aswell.   Here is a joke about this topic that will show you how racism is still alive and kickn.  Why should blacks and mexicans never marry and have kids?      Because the kids would be to lazy to steal.     Now some people laugh at that while other take great offence.        I would say go ahead and have mixed kids because kids will always find something to mock one another about.|`|DeEZQQM0aa	Well it just depends where you live,if you live in a big city we have allot of different ethnic groups so I do not think people pay much attention to it.I see white mothers with black children all the time.  However when it comes to marriage sometimes it can be hard to marry someone of a different race it is not always that people are racist,but there are some culture difference that are hard for the couple to get passed.But if they are truly in love then they can work passed it.I do however think it looks ridiculous when a person tries to act like a different race to fit in with their partner.|`|HLIv7TLHaa	Sadly, ignorance is not dead and racism still raises its ugly head.    As long as people continue to view the world in absolutes (either/or; us vs them; black and white).  This problem will continue to be the bane of society.    Each of us (I'm certainly guilty of this too) has got to find a way to look past the "catagories" of people that have been established by society and start seeing people by the content of their individual actions (as proposed by Matin Luther King JR.).|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	because some people are just plain rude. I have a lot of african american friends and I'm white and they are there for me if I need something :o) and they dont complain or want anything back.  :o)|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	I am half black half white. I hardly had any trouble while growing up that was related to race. One white kid didn't want his friends to hang out with me because he disliked black people. His friends told him to F off. Problem solved. A few black kids claimed I wasn't black enough. I did not hang out with them. Problem solved. I was a normal kid and led a normal life.    People say that kids will have a hard time because that's what they believe. They're wrong, but they won't really understand how/why they are wrong until they see it for themselves. Interracial marriage is no big deal. Some people may stare, but it's usually just curiosity. When I see a black/white couple, I kinda stare a little, and my own parents are black/white. Sometimes looking and observing can ease curiosity. It's not always a hate stare.|`|4boTYkt7aa	Racism is alive and well in this country.You just have to prepare your child for the ignorance that they will encounter and teach them how to handle it.People can be so nice,can't they?|`|2afVnStxaa	Sadly to say that there is still alot of racism out there, but this now comes from all races not just any one race though. It is sad that race is still an issue in many states, (mainly the southern states) but it is a fact of life for now. As to the mixed race issue, this is also saddly still true in some areas. The thing is it isn't just as simple as a racism thing, it is more of a racism issue that is internal to a race, an example would be someone who was a mix of caucasion and african american, in some places they would not be accepted by caucassions or african americans because of the mix. It is a sad thing in this day and age, but does happen still in some places. I have a neice that is of mixed race and she has a really hard time in Georgia where she lives because of it. It really angers me that we cannot seem to get past this in this country. But part of the problem is the fact that we as a people feel the need for labels which keep us seperated in our minds. Such as Italian American, African American, ETC. The thing is if someone comes from say Italy and gets citizenship here, they are an Italian American, but if they have children they would simply be American. Psychologically a label will cause a mental seperation. So while we all need to take pride in our heritage and ancestry, we also need to stop placing labels on anything and everything and become one as a people. Hope this helps. Good luck to you.|`|0udjgaoBaa	Im mixed German, black and ponca indian (28). I never had any problems about my race. honestly I just had black girls being jealous of me because I dont have to get relaxers and what not...They thought that I acted Like "I was pretty" which I never have...But My mom has always gotten compliments on how pretty her kids are, shes german. I love being mixed and I teach my kids to say that they are mixed..My Husband is Puerto Rican Go figure.|`|TkUF1PI4aa	It has happened & still does. Racism will sadly never end & there will always be ignorant people out there raising their kids the same way so the kids at school won't know any better b/c they have ignorant/closet racist parents.|`|Fyffqh4Yaa	yeah sometimes not always|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Obama is of a mixed race, and look how much crap he got while running for office about his race.  Yes, people are still that racist -- and they always will be.|`|MHwn4Tlzaa	At my son's school, the most popular junior in school has an African American father and caucasian mother.  It seems to work well for him.    I think people are scared of this because it doesn't happen a lot.  People are afraid of change.|`|AA11328507	Some people will say anything to discourage something they are against.      I am a black woman and 2 of my sons have had babies with mixed women.  My grandkids look white, and I could care less if they came out purple.  Life is life and love is love and the world needs to deal with it.  We are all mixed but ALL human PERIOD|`|15e58edf21f33dd475298413b3cd6d8caa	hard to believe people bring up their children hating other races...i love all woman of the world(as long as they are clean)  lol|`|FAQldsUZaa	There are still racists in the world today... personally I think some people take it a little too far. I've never had a problem w/ any of my biracial friends, and never seen them have problems growing up either. I havent seen where "mixed" kids had it harder in school either. It isnt the kids that have a problem w/ interracial relationships, it's adults. I'm married to a white man, and we have 2 children together, but if I were single, yes I would date a black man. However, adults would have a problem w/ this (some)... It's just the way the world is, and it will never change.|`|77ZVd5hyaa	I'm of mixed race and so is my son. I think that it all depends on where you live and how educated the people are who live there.    Neither one of us has had any problems. We are both very outspoken and I guess that could be as to why.     I've just never had a hard time with anything in my life.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	Because they do. I went to school with biracial kids. Half black half white. They didn't fit in with either race. The white guys wouldn't date them because they were black, and the black guys wouldn't date them because they were white. They weren't odd looking they were pretty, but neither race of kids would claim them. I think all kids take their fair amount of teasing, but most kids still have a group of friends that they "belong" with, that have their back, but with a lot of biracial kids, they don't have that. They are considered freaks by everyone all because they are mixed races.   A friend of mine had biracial nieces, and they went through the same thing. The kids in their neighborhood were nasty all because they "didn't belong" to either race.  Sadly people can still be that racist, even in this day and age...|`|5ViTUTyZaa	I am white, husband is African.  One child, one on the way.  Other kids have never given my son a hard time but adults have.  The only question we get from other kids is out of curiosity because I am very very white and my son is very very dark, so they ask if he is adopted.    The only issue I think my son may have is culturally he is being raised exposed to African culture rather than African-American culture (His father is African, not American).  I think that is an asset though.    On another note - I think racism in the US has become cultural racism rather than skin color.  When people find out my husband is NOT African American their tone will completely change from thinking I am a white hoodrat to having a decent tone and respect for me.|`|X5afTqKiaa	Yes people are so ignorant|`|zspVPoLZaa	idk me personally im black and i would never marry anything but a black man, i mean im not racists but i just cant see a family with anything but a black man!!|`|lX4k5ub4aa	there are just some racist people inside the world thats just the way they were born|`|o5rfI7oUaa	Yes unforunately, but u still hav to maintain ur racial sanity...|`|GjifanQlaa	cause people are stupid. i personally think biracial kids and adults are some of the most attractive people in the world....makes me jealous.|`|Gx14PIvxaa	IMO, it's not that they won't be accepted, it's that they appear to have two different cultures in their blood, and people I've known in the past who are biracial have expressed that it's hard to get along with black kids OR white kids because they're not either one. In my geographical location, black is the majority race, and they are all so "proud" of being black that they shun others who are mixed. They are even racist amongst themselves, according to the darkness of their skin. That's just my personal experience, anyway...
AuKKjaxaaa	I had identical twin step-brothers when my mother remarried.  At first they looked the same but after a while I could tell them apart with effort and when they were teenagers I couldn't mistake one for the other.  I say had because they had diabetes and were doing a variety of drugs and one of them died from a blood clot complication, but I digress.    When they are born they'll have umbilical cord clips identifying which is which, but you may want to check for birthmarks or toenails or something to keep track of them when they are infants.  I don't know how long it will take for them to develop distinct personalities.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	yep because identical twins are not truly identical.  There is always something about them that is different and when you see them everyday you see the differences very easily.    FWIW:  are you sure your mom is expecting identical twins?  You can't always tell from the ultrasound  (identicals share a placenta and you can't always tell that from the ultrasound.  sometimes you have to wait until they are born to see that.)|`|hYZIYla0aa	You are not the only one to ask this question.When my twins were born I had to lay them next to each other,Identical  twins do have their differences.As they get older you will notice the differences between them.Other people may not know the differnce between the two.My one twin grew a mole on left cheek,has a higher forehead and is about an inch and a half taller.You will figure it out,don't panic!Congrats!!!
3Rr5SAhhaa	at least a month or 2 before you plan on moving in. Sometimes finding a decent apartment can be hard, or the one you want is completely full. Definitly start looking before hand, even if it is just looking into what areas you would like to live in.|`|jhNUuz0maa	You can start looking now. If you have an apartment complex you are interested in, you could let them know, and then if anything comes available for Nov, they will let you know. This way, you will have many options to chose from, and not having to settle for a dump at the last minute. Plus, you will have enough money saved up for any filing fees, etc.      Since you will pay for a full month of rent, the lease should be signed about a week before you move in. That will give you enough time to transfer electric into your names, turn on cable and phone.|`|Lb6Y7xlnaa	Awww congrats!!   My Fiance' and I JUST got approved for one the OTHER day!! =)  He is in Iraq and I live with my parents. When he gets back he will be stationed in Arizona and we started looking for one 2 months ahead to give them time to know if they would have anything availabe in March when he returns. We are getting married in APRIL...    Just call and explain your situation. To make things easier, I made a list of some apartments and then did research on ech one. I then called and asked them what they had available.. if they had what i was looking for, how much the rent would be etc...     Hope you find one!!|`|nqINitkmaa	At least 2 months prior. But you can start now if you find a place you really like he can live there alone until the wedding and then you can move in. Maybe start looking through online adds right now and really decide what you want, you may be surpised on what you can or cannot get. Good Luck!!|`|5DJcir9saa	It all depends on the area in which you are looking.  It wouldn't hurt to go out and get some ideas in August or September.  Then you'll have an idea of what kind of place will be available in November.  Some places may have a waiting list, some may be completely full, and others may have lots of vacancies.  So it'd definitely be a good idea to check that out in advance.  Then once you decide, you could probably let the apartment complex know in early October, what you're plans are.  They can usually hold an apartment for you (will probably require some sort of deposit).  Other than that deposit, you will just have to pay everything on the day you move in.    While out apartment hunting, be sure to tell the complex manager what your plans are and they will let you know everything you would need to do to be moved in by November 1st.
a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	My brother's wedding set him and his wife back about $1700. They had ~50 guests. A homestyle buffet  wasprepared by the local ladies auxiliary from the firecompany where he was a member, they had ham, mac & cheese, fruit platters, veggie platters, pasta and sauce and meatballs, rolls, butter, etc. My aunt purchased their cake as a gift but you could easily have a nice cake on a budget. They used the firehouse's sound system and hooked their laptop up to it to play their prepared playlist. One of my mom's friend's tended the bar for free (she got tips) and my bro bought only beer and a few kinds of liquor to makea couple mixed drinks with the sodas and juice provided. My SiL's dress was $35, my mom made it, and the veil too. There were only flowers for the bridal party, the centerpioeces were provided by the firehouse, they used decorations from their various celebrations so it was unique. Overall the wedding was a LOT of fun and they enjoyed it. If you can manage on compromising you can work within your budget.    Good luck!|`|0jUGSaZPaa	It's possible if you put your mind to it!!  Def. try it.  If you go a little higher, don't beat yourself up over it.    It sounds like you did a lot of cash cuttings here, which is great!!  You have everything figured out...     With guests, have your fiancee look at it and mark some off...  My fiancee and I have big families, and his parents are shocked at our numbers, b/c his older brother just got married and had about 100 guests JUST FOR HIM (his wife only had her parents and a few co workers)...  But, his parents are giving us money to pay for the guests that they want invited...    So, if your fiancee and his family INSISTS that these guests be invited, why not ask for a little help then?    Good luck!!    P.S.  About your wedding gown... Be sure to tell your consultant how much you are willing to spend, and be stern about it...  I did this at a high priced boutique and fell in love with a gown that was $1500!!  My limit was $500...  I was very upset... I will not push myself to spend that much...|`|nqINitkmaa	I don't know how much the food is. But you can make your own centerpieces, go to a craft store. So that way the only flowers you have to get is a bouquet and a boutiner, or you can make them too out of fake flowers from the craft store. Have a friend take all the pictures for you. Do the tents come with tables and chairs? You'll also need plates and flat wear unless your friend that does the catering can provide that as well. You'll also need table lines which you can get plastic ones at a party Supply store if you'd like, or you can make your own by purchasing fabric and just sewing seams into them. You can have a friend DJ for you, now adays everyone has all the songs they like on an ipod or computer, so I'm sure between all your friends someone has a sound system you can use. Thats all the ideas I have. Good Luck!|`|d43e96506445ef1b6b4ace4380a9a5b4aa	That all depends on the type of wedding YOU want. My fiance and I have chosen to have a small backyard wedding with a bbq reception. Depending on how many people you will be inviting (we will have approx 35) you might be able to do it. Since ours is very low key, we are using the pop up type canopy tents and doing some seating under shade trees instead of spending the money on tents. My grandfather has tables and chairs so I dont have to rent those either. My entire wedding, including the food and the cake, will run me less than 1500.|`|ge3meKYEaa	Wow, I guess your not paying for any of the food?  Even supplies?  That doesn't seem like enough money for food and drinks.......tent, DJ, decorations, your dress......    I skip the wedding and just do the honeymoon!|`|3MDY29gnaa	There is a way!  There are lots of things you can do.    1 you really have to prioritize   You CAN NOT have everything and anything. That's  1 Because of course if you want everything. Because everything cost money.    *Now you can do a lot of DIY (Do it yourself) things.  If you go to Michaels or Michaels.com (the store has more to choose from) They have very beautiful wedding invitations that you can print off yourself. Many of them are better than those in the catalogs.  *Use Silk Flowers- they are beautiful as well. Make your own Flowers, They are not that hard and you can also buy those things at Michaels.   *Go to bridal shows- I actually just went to one yesterday. There are many ideas there and lots of discounts (i got a $100 gift certificate from Davids bridal). I also won a wedding cake knife and server This set retails at $69.99.   * Have someone make your wedding dress, or you can even order off of ebay.  *If you have someone who bakes cakes in your family, see if they can make your wedding cake maybe as a bridal gift for you and your husband to be.   *DJ- make your own music, Have a family member or friend be your DJ, A friend of mine had lots and lots of songs loaded onto her laptop and had a family member play the songs she wanted, just hooked it up to lots of pro. Speakers.   *Have an Adult only reception. Or have an early wedding. Where at the reception you can serve small finger foods. Or try to find a reception site who allows you to bring in your own food.   *Find a photographer who has a set rate. Not one who charger per hour or per shot. This may be a little hard to find but THEY ARE OUT THERE. I know a few where I live (Columbus, OH) do this. One charges $450 edits, and touch ups everything she does, and puts it on a disk then gives you rights to print them yourself. Or go to your local community college and ask a photography student to shoot your weding. Lots of people do this and the kids love it! (Also try this for your wedding cake)    If you need anything else let me know. I have many other ways to save!!!|`|AA11082914	I definitely think it's doable. My budget is $5000 for 250 guests. The way I figure it, you've got less than half my guest count and half my budget. Sounds good to me.|`|AA11760899	Not sure, how many people are you having? That way we will be able to give you a better answer.      Ok, this is possible. I am not sure where you live, but when picking out the food, do finger foods, cold salads, mini sandwiches, or just a dessert and punch reception.   the good thing is since you are having it out side, you wont need much decoration.   The tents might be a bit pricey, so shop around, or look into awnings, or tarping. You might be able to find a white tarp, or nicer color tarp and having a friend or some family helping you put it up.   For tables and chairs, look around at your local firehouse, elks lodge, schools, funeral home, bingo hall, etc. to see if they will rent you out some chairs and/or tables for a low price, or check with someone you might know who could get this for free.  You can also look for some picnic tables, ask around also at local venues, or parks, or groves to see if they will let you borrow them.   Stick to paper or plastic plates and cutlery, napkins and cups. For the drinks if you dont want to do alcohol (since that can get pretty pricey) look into soda, punch, water, tea, or juices.   If its at night and you want lighting, use christmas lights and candles. They are cheap!   For dessert, you can have some family or friends do that cake or cookies, or go to your local grocery store who will do a cake for you.I if you do the cake yourself, or have someone do it for you wal-mart sells fondant kits (the icing that makes the cake look really pretty) in the craft/wedding section.   For music, if you are comftorable having just an MP3 player or stereo do that! If not, maybe have a friend or someone that does DJing on the side do it for a cheaper price.   Photographer. Have a freind or family do this also. Or, have a college student do your picks for you for a discount price. They will gladly take much less than a professional is asking for.   Do you have your dress yet? If not, check out craigslist, and ebay. Go to a local bridal shop to find your size. And find a dress you like and get it off the itnernet if you can. Or find a dress off the rack. Lots of options out there now a days for a dress.  For a veil, make it yourself! Tulle costs maybe $2-$4 a yard in a craft store. Why pay $200 for it??  Where are you having the actual ceremony? If you are catholic and your church mandates a fee, try going to a Born-again christian church if you want to get married in church. They charge a lot less. Or if you are member of your church or synogauge call them and see what they can do.   If not and you are not a church goer, then a justice of the peace will only charge around 100 dollars. Make sure you put the marriage certificate in the budget! Its only about 30 bucks or so, but dont overlook it.  for the rings, try goldspeed.com. Thats where I got my fiances ring for $220. Or, try sears. I got mine there for $160 on the after christmas clearance. try department stores that are going out of business (in this day and age, that shouldnt be hard to do).      Skip the favors!! No one keeps those anyway. Lose the centerpieces, Or just use the candle lighting for those. Skip fancy linens. Go to the dollar store and get those plastic table covers. They come in all sorts of nice colors! skip place cards and table cards. Let people seat themselves. Skpe decorations, again you are outside, you dont need them.  Have your fiance wear a nice dress shirt and dress pants, he doenst need a tux, just to look nice.   Flowers- you do not need a boatload of flowers for a wedding no matter how many people say you do. For your bouquet, go to a local grocery store and grap some of those pre-made bouquets in the flower department. Have your maids, if you are having any care just one flower or rose, and have the groom and groomsmen wear a flower, or a fern for their boutinare and make them yourself!  For the invitations make or print them yourself. and make sure you put postage in your budget.   I think you should be just fine.   Make  a spreadsheet or write everything you will need. Budget for each section what you think the food, rings, dress, etc will cost and  try to stick to it!!    If its over $2500 try  to skimp in an area where you can or try some do it yourself tricks.   You can definately pull this off.  Just be wise, and shop aroud for deals, and think of some other options if you need to. if you have to add another $500 or so to make it easier on yourself, then do it. You are going to need the help of your family and friends to pull this off, but its tons of fun!!   good luck and remember to not get stressed!!!      EDIT-Sounds like you have alot set already!! For the tent, just do one. Make sure you ask them ahead of time to give you any hidden costs. Youw ill have to pay for the tents if you cancel that day. I love how your food is only costing $500!! You are going to be just fine. Just shop around and see if you can find a cheapter alternative to the tent if need be. If it rains you can always just go in back and use that tent. You'll be able to pull this off just fine. Dont worry!    One more idea, instead of a champagne toast, how about just having people use whatever is in their hand? That way you can save $200, or use sparkling cider, much cheaper!!|`|ODYrypwaaa	I did my wedding for $5000 and thought that was tight.  If you get marred at a church or someones back yard, through out the extras you can do it.   OR get married at the court and spend it all on the honeymoon.  I'd rather do the wedding thing than have  a vacation.|`|qELsJbO3aa	Well, it really depends on you, your standards, how resourceful you are, and the wedding you're planning.    $2500 is not a lot of money. Some people spend more than that on their dress alone. Photography can easily cost more than that. I also don't know how much tents are going to cost you or if you're also renting tables and chairs (and linens, and dishware). If you have a DJ you might need to rent a dance floor, that could be expensive. I also don't know how much your budget would be if you weren't putting the money towards the honeymoon.    So really, it all depends on what you're willing to give up and how easily can you find cheaper alternatives. Personally would add a little more to the wedding fund and still go on a honeymoon.|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	Depending on the number of guests, but i think it is possible. But you would have to cut out things like favors, maybe even centerpieces. You will really, REALLY have to shop around and budget and it will be hard. But think of it this way, 20-30 years from now will you want to look back at your wedding and say, " It looked like we spent $2500" or would you rather spend a little bit more money and have a nicer wedding that wont end up looking cheap? I'm not saying to have a $50,000 wedding, just a nicer wedding.|`|493bd246fd26d0e4c730058dc333cc80aa	My husband and I did, but we were lucky enough to have family that really helped and we did a lot our self . We found incredible deals at Davids Bridal, they were on clearance I got 5 dresses for about $150. We bought the pans and decorations for our cake and a friend made it for us. My Aunt and Uncle got the Hall for the wedding/reception. I think that my dress and th DJ were the most expensive things. It was beautiful.|`|gtunOva2aa	Ok, so this is kinda ghetto, and I expect to be flamed for this, but you could always buy the tents from somewhere like Lowe's or Walmart, and return them afterwards.. For food, you can get a meat and cheese platter, they are fairly inexpensive, and for a photographer, what we are doing is getting disposable cameras for our tables.. you'd be surprised at some of the photos that they can take!|`|87baf4e37625b3b6e240032efa301182aa	I ordered my dress online at www.lightinthebox.com and got it for under $200 with shipping. Me and my Fiance rented a hall though included with everything (food, limo, dj, cake, decorations) for $3,800, so all you have to do is look around and shop!!! Hope all goes well!
ODYrypwaaa	I am married now, but I always wanted my a specific proposal.  My man and I had our first kiss on a playground next to his house.  I thought it would be totally awesome if he decorated the playground with balloons and put out a picnic and proposed there. I still love the proposal I got!  I mean the man of my dreams asked me to marry him.  So all in all I totally win.  :)
sM6d8ZgWaa	I kiss both her pairs of lips but the bottom one are my fav :p|`|ZR34thBvaa	The only thing I want a girl to use her mouth for is sucking me off.|`|5d5t1Rpeaa	i usually find my self kissing the top lip lol|`|1AFDw5KDaa	top deff    :)|`|UThG15FLaa	It can be both.  it's good to switch things up a little.    ;]|`|EU25Jvtqaa	wow! a nice question indeed.ok let me replay in my mind.... i love nibbling the bottom lip n then it begins like a wild n long smooch.. involving both the lips.|`|n7uF90t3aa	Both! Switch it up a little!|`|XqAWm9Yjaa	It's both|`|GLBWe3A9aa	My girlfriend kisses my top|`|fXzed3fLaa	Both, bottom first, then top, then tongue|`|nXSYsQLCaa	yea gurl the bottom lip is juicey!!!!!!!!!!!  i do it to my boyfriends lips all the time, he kisses me and the top to but mostly for me it is the bottom i bite his bottom lip b/c that he likes it like that.|`|QWiqt5VFaa	Always kiss the top lip, unless your going for tounges, bite it gently!
NgnbtaORaa	You need to apologize to your woman until she forgives you and then do something like take her away for like four days and say something like this: I wanna take you away for four days and spend some quality time together to make up for the time I have missed away from you.    Good luck|`|o7E59VYZaa	I think the real question is why did you ignore her for 4 days???|`|jJwuMTSqaa	You should get your girlfriend a new boyfriend. Women do not like to be ignored. Period.|`|uXeGsxSVaa	I would say get yourself a  phone and some flowers for her.|`|HEOWbQIXaa	Get her flowers and say I'm sorry|`|3tHTZ2lKaa	flowers, ballons, and a letter leave it in her front door..  so knock and run..but make sure she takes it..  =]  it would be soooo wonderful!|`|A8OVGLdiaa	just get her flowers and write a cute sorry note with that|`|SYjXSMsSaa	Get her some flower write a poam an I will help email me danettacarter@ymail.com I fix so many problems come to me|`|0rRkRAnJaa	I've got to agree with jewels, lol.|`|nZ4cOSDZaa	flowers or chocolate|`|IMHwA20jaa	Get her something she'd like and not something dumb. Get her a pair of earings, a taco, chocolates, a giant smelling pink ink octopus, and infested roses.|`|8ACdEaC5aa	give her an apology|`|TWW5DGttaa	Don't focus on getting her something to make it better. Talk it out and if one of you two were wrong about something (which i'm guessing is you since you're the one buying crap) admit it and work on not doing that anymore. She will appreciate that a lot more and you never know what you might get out of it. Whatever you do don't get her flowers or s tuffed animal though. That just says I screwed up and just trying to make you not mad anymore.|`|lNqSx1znaa	Send flowers immediately and show up with jewelry!|`|T7ebpbg1aa	**** in a box|`|dyHKPlgZaa	call her. and buy her flowers or chocolates. but still call her.|`|CNYpBKGQaa	a huge gigantic bag of porn|`|0dEaFrFOaa	An apology. Normally that would smooth things over.|`|jN98MkiVaa	send her a dozen or two of roses delivered to her with ballons with a big sign saying IM SORRY!!!|`|O46f8wl3aa	What do you 'get her'?? Are you kidding me? Well, if I were her I'd kick your ***... and if you're girl is so materialist that she'd be ok with you after you buy her something then maybe you should consider if this is someone you really wanna be with... I mean dam...|`|aVPhSOHFaa	start with a im and then ge some flowers or do like my bofriend copy off a poem off the internet and tell you wrote it...or be like my boyfirend again and give some $$$ girls like money...|`|2jSX5nQkaa	take her out somewhere. make her feel special after ignoring her for 4 days. she will appreciate it and see you put thought into something.|`|AqvEHHsTaa	an apology and then some cute that shows you mean that you are sorry.  Something heart felt, not cheesy.  Sometimes, just an apology is worth all the presents.  You can't buy love.|`|nXSYsQLCaa	well a nice apology would work and  you begging on your knees for her to forgive her buy her some flowers and candy and treat her to a find resturant that you can afford besides mcd's and burger king she deserves betta than that. i'm not saying like red lobster just show her how sorry you really are okay and that you care about her needs and how she feels about you and how you feel about her.|`|7413AjIPaa	Chocolates.  Women LOVEE chocolate.  And mabey even write her a poem.  Idk do something that will stand out,to let her  know your sorry.    Hope that helps. (:
ajwIPeFXaa	i think you are totally right. I dont know if you should myspace her or not. That needs to be up to you, if you feel comfortable doing that or not. However, I do think it is a good plan to let her know that you were the reason he stopped talking to her, and that you feel like it was childish, and you want them to be able to be friends again.  Good for you, really. Its a pretty big step.|`|AA11105856	Yeah i wouldn't let her know your going back into town she may think u want to start a relationship with her ( friends) whatever it may be. Maybe she doesn't even live there anymore. I would say just move back like everything is fine. If she runs into your man you should trust him enough to be a gentleman and make small talk if she talks to him if not just ignore her. Now if u and him run into her and she talks to u guys let her know your happy and getting married maybe she will get the hint|`|InZU5aaxaa	I was the same way with my fiance. Although my situation is a little more complex. I asked him to stop talking to her because he asked me to stop talking to an ex boyfriend of mine who just happened to be my best friend from high school. He did but when she kept talking to him I told him I was going to talk to my old friend. He stopped replying to her text and answering her calls late at night. She works late and that is when she does all her phone calls. I explained that it hurt me that when we are in bed watching a movie and she calls he answers. After ten is my time. He relayed that to her and she respected our time.     Now a year later we are talking again. She contacted me and said we need to hang out. I am over what happened in the past but I am still a little uncomfortable/self confidence when I do see her. We do talk on a normal basis though. If I was you I would have him contact her. Have him tell her it would be nice if the two of you could hang out some time. Then talk with him and lay down some ground rules. He can talk to her but respect your relationship and not go out of his way to make contact. No matter what you do make sure you sit down with him and explain your concerns. If he is what you make him sound to be he will understand and not be mad.     Good luck and if you need to talk please email.|`|a35c4a3ab714036bfd3c31e133920f9caa	yea, you should let her know the whole story and apologize.  especially if she never did anything.  send her a message.  everyone deserves another chance.  good luck|`|8ACdEaC5aa	hmm... i think the girl deserves an explanation... trust your fiance and see where things go.... the girl might not take your reason well, but its worth a try.
76nTvO4iaa	There are photographers in Dallas who do "boudoir (pronounced bood-wah) photography."   Call around and ask.  Many of the professional athetes wives have those sort of pictures made for Valentine's day.    Make sure they provide a female chaperone for the photography sessions.  If not, take a friend with you.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	You should ask a girlfriend to take them for you.  Absolutely do not have your mom (or any other family member) take them.  Total turn-off.  For that matter, don't tell your man which girlfriend took them .. no point in putting ideas in his head.|`|rcut6bhoaa	Do it yourself, using a mirror.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	There is people in Dallas that will fill your request, the problem is locating the good ones.  Some place ads in the local underground papers, and you will even find some in the local yellow pages, but they may not be willing to photograph totally nude pictures.  Just look around you will find what your looking for.  I have a photographer in the Oklahoma city area, him and his wife have a studio and will take nude to whatever you want.  Good luck.|`|XTBlOf9baa	Get your local Yellow Pages, look up photographers, then call to ask if each photographer takes "boudoir photos." That's what they're called in photography, not seductive pictures. Anyway, that's the best way to make sure you're working with a reputable person, and not some sleeze bag who wants to see your goods. I hope that helps.|`|izbAdDUraa	I am in dallas too. i have asked this question to my friends before, and if you know any small time photog they would be the best bet. ALSO another female would be MUCH better to go with, so you dont have some weird akwardness when your hubby asks... "So.. who took these of you?!?!?!?"  i also DO NOT recommend searching on CRAIGSLIST for this. You could fall victim easily and possibly be hurt.. raped.. molested. Don't trust random people with something like this. Look for someone reputable or even  a friend just starting out that you know already.   Also. you could get crafty with your own digital camera, and do things you wouldnt want to do in front of the photographer in the privacy of your own home!! :]|`|0d0W0nbVaa	and when your husband asks,  'who took the picture'?    whatcha gonna say?  some 'seductive picture taker' you found from Y!A?   lol.|`|MkBWfaJlaa	this has to be a put on - cmon!|`|RvFwmQOPaa	Go to craigslist and put in the Dallas area and check under the services category for a photographer.|`|HvALvdc7aa	Get a camera with a timer and take them yourself. You can get a photo printer for around 40.00 .|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	Be careful who you choose, and bring someone with you when you go to the photoshoot. Some photographers expect you to change clothes in front of them, and they start snapping pictures the moment you step in the door. They might even save some photos for themselves that you would want erased if you saw them. Be careful about contracts too. You don't want to find your pictures on an adult website or something.|`|SiniSj1eaa	My boss is a photographer on the side. He does pictures like this..and I know that a lot of these type of photographer can be found on a site called model mayhem...You could contact a photographer on that site and discuss this with them..a lot of those photographers deal with these type of photos and lot are artistic about it or can do it however you please..     and in order for anyone to use your pictures they have to have you sign a model agreement ...if you dont sign it and they use the photos then you can sue them big time..so dont let that scare you.     The photographers on this site are very reputable..and will work with you on pricing..    Dont let the name fool you. Its not just for modeling..and lot of photographers can be found on that site..and you can look in the dallas area.. :)|`|8txWayVnaa	You're looking for a photographer who does "boudoire" photography.  I know you said the photographer doesn't have to be from your area, but I doubt you're willing to come to Delaware or fly me to Dallas!  LOL!!!!    Try doing a search on google or "whitepages.com" for "boudoire photography" in your area and see what turns up.    Good luck.|`|aXYiOskmaa	look up boudoir photography. that's what they're usually called|`|yMyJ9Y6Aaa	I would suggest having a female friend that you are comfortable with take the pictures because your husband might not like having some dude taking pic of his wife.|`|zspVPoLZaa	idk, good luck with that!!!!|`|AA11104967	Maybe I can help...nudge nudge...wink wink|`|8c535adab7e1972d8d073a1e23ab28c1aa	It is usually best to get them taken by a friend on a digital camera, and find a good source to have them developed.      If you take them to just anywhere, you will find them posted on the interenet.|`|LUWQ5S5jaa	Get a camera, open your legs and click lol.  I am sure he will love it.|`|ooT1Gj2Xaa	If you live in MN I know one!|`|5NKa5Y8laa	This is not as crazy as some others think.  My fiance and I have been thinking of getting some partially nude (as in, with a sheet draped prevocateurly around me), or lingerie, sexy and seductive (but still sensibly modest) photos together.    My sister had some similar photos taken of herself about 10 years ago, by a professional photographer in a studio.  They did her hair and makeup too, it was all very professionally done, she said she felt very comfortable, and the photos are fabulous.  10 years (and 3 kids) later, she certainly doesnt have any regrets and her husband thinks they are great!      So find a great photographer, either by personal recommendation, or in the yellow pages, as them if they take those kind of shots, and dont be shy, they are professionals and know how to act it. Just like going to the doctor or something.     Have fun!|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I have been thinking about having some boudoir photos taken of myself too.  My sister had a really good (female) photographer for her wedding - that also does other types of photos.  I will contacting her this summer to see if she can do some tasteful photos.  I'd like my husband to have some nice pics of me - before my body ages too much.  Find a professional (female) photographer in the area and ask!  I don't know how far you want to go - but discuss it with the photographer and hopefully - if they don't do that - they can refer you to a professional that can.
XfFFGvtgaa	I would marry the man I'm in love with, and who will do whatever it takes to keep us together and make it through the difficult times.

ce060a29a8e7cbb3f7cdc004ec90adc3aa	Ms Crone, it's time for a family meeting. Gather everyone together and discuss what occurred in front of everyone and then both you and your husband need to question the two sisters in front of everyone. Find out WHY they felt that they had the right to snoop into matters which were not their concern. Ask them what compelled them to desecrate your sacred spaces and rummage through your items of worship. Ask them if that would make it acceptable to go through their stuff? Would it make it OK for YOU to rummage through their sacred objects? chances are they went through your BOS (or equivalent), Would THEY be willing to have the contents of THEIR journals read through without being invited?     Then ask them if they have a problem with your Religion and your practice of it. Ask them if they would like it if YOU decided that their Religion was unworthy of being respected, would that make it OK for you to be so disrespectful towards them. Inform them that they were guests in YOUR home and as such they completely overstepped the bounds of both family and guest. Then turn around and ask them what THEIR private little secrets are which THEY don't want anyone prying into. I can guarantee you, they have some as well. They're family and you know SOME of the little tidbits that float around families. Bring them up but don't reveal too much. Just enough to get their attention. Then ask them if you would like to continue the discussion along that line. When they say "No", and they will, ask them for one good reason not to, after they felt that they could meddle in your lives. BE confontational but not angry. Keep your wits about you and do not let it degrade to an argument. But DO keep it on the subject, that being. THEY violated YOUR household. When they have had time to consider their actions in front of the REST of the family that is when you get the REST involved, Ask the REST if that is the kind of behavior that a family is supposed to display. And then ask them what responce should be forthcoming from you and your husband towards those two sisters. Come to a solution as a family. Yes, the sisters WILL risk the wrath of the entire family but odds are they won't get as bad as they gave out to you and your hubby.     Lastly, the Two sisters are going to have to EARN not only YOUR trust, both you AND your husband; but earn back the trust of the rest of the family, as well. NO ONE is going to trust them in their homes either, nor should they. Then you tell tham that they aren't welcome in your home until you and your husband have cooled off a bit and then they are welcome back by invitation only and will not be allowed to enter your house without either you or your husband present.    That's THAT problem, now for YOUR problem. YOU, my dear Witch, will need to cleanse every single item which they have touched and banish every single bit of negative and malevolent energy which they may have introduced to each item as they desecrated it. If you must use incense, sage, candles, whatever it is that you will use to achieve the cleansing process and then send them the bill for all the consumable materials that you will use. If they refuse to pay for it then the length of time of their banishment is extended by the length of time in which they refuse to make restitution for the harm that they have caused.    Once ALL of that is finally settled, THEN my dear Witch, be magnanimous and let it go. Once the appropriate responsiblity and atonement has been achieved, there is no sense in carrying things any further.    Brightest Blessings,  Raji the Green Witch|`|qmLjEXlDaa	I think the both of you (you & hubby) need to speak to his sisters.  I would tell them how you feel and ask what is the reason they were going through your things.  You're married a long time and what was the point of all this and or what did they hope to find.      In addition this is now a trust issue and no one would like anyone invading their personal space.|`|Bq51x58jaa	let him deal with it his own way. fair play to him for sticking up for u against his family not may men would. hes obviously upset so let him be. its his house to rem and im sure he would be the same if they were rumaging through his stuff.|`|uUuOAXcEaa	Well first of all i wouldn't want someone looking through my stuff no matter who they are. They were welcomed in your home but not welcome to invade your personal space. Next time just have you or your husband there and tell them they are not welcome in the house without you guys there. Just let them know your relationship is still the same but what they did was wrong. Im sure you wouldn't be going through there stuff so why should they do that to you?|`|AA12202402	Easiest way to calm the fire on this would be as follows  I would sit down and chat with him about the differences between your religion. Use the religion card. Maybe these sisters have no knowledge of wiccan and instead of coming out and asking you questions about your beliefs they were trying to find out information. Maybe just maybe they thought it would offend you to ask questions. Maybe even they thought you were a bad witch.......See My Sister-in-law is wiccan and I am Church of Christ. I was curious and just asked. Guess i am way bolder than your kin folks. You are a good person with a good circle you can figure it out|`|3eac4095162a8fc3b0c7ab465f41b17daa	Your hubby is very admirable. I would suggest not getting involved.  Those sisters need to aplogize to him for taking advanatage of his kindness and giving a key for them to come over and change.    And apologize to you for their rude behavior.    Not talking with them for a few weeks, or a few months is a fine idea.  And then send them a note around Sept. reminding them of the selfish behavior and suggesting they apologize so, they'd be invited to a holdiay dinner/ lunch|`|GmMB5HtCaa	I think you should approach them and tell them they need to respect your space and your husbands , and as long as you dont push your beliefs on them then they shouldnt do it to you either if their bro can love you as you are then his family should too because you make him happy and you dont want to come between them.|`|atzw0IP4aa	Change the locks. Tell your husband to tell his sisters that they are not welcome, at least until they apologize and make right by you.    Cleanse your space , and put up some added protection just in case.     If and when they try to do it again, they will meet your obstacles in place.     Lesson - you can't pick your relatives, and now you know what they are.|`|HLIv7TLHaa	It is unfortunate that your husband's sisters as petty and close minded as they are.      From what I've read, it appears to me that your husband is still weighing whether or not he wishes to continue a relationship of any kind with his sisters.  A choice that is....up to him.  You did not cause this riff and from what I gather, he certainly isn't blaming you for it.  In fact, it appears that the responsibility for the riff is squarly where it should be...on the sisters.  I've no doubt that during the argument, he made a very strong case to the sisters that their behavior was totally on called for.  That behavior was as much an invasion of his privacy as it was yours.  It was also an act of betrayal and a breech of trust (even as tenious as it was to begin with) for the both of you.      It seems to me that the family that is most important to him is, as it should be, the one he shares with you.   You are both entitled to your feelings and I'm guessing that in time he will find some way to forgive and stay connected to his sisters.   I say this because from what you say, he's a very open minded, supportive and caring individual.|`|TRt4tWGFaa	Stay out of it,,,your husband is doing very well ..     His family,,you was the one done wrong..yet when its over ,,you'll will be at fault,,if you open your mouth..been there..|`|ZaMzRSrraa	his sisters INVADED HIS HOME/PRIVACY- EVEN IF IT WAS YOUR STUFF        ITS HIS RELATIONSHIP - LET HIM DO HIS THING|`|QE77Oxtqaa	Personally, I wouldn't care if they messed with my books. Maybe they would learn something.    As for the other stuff, they had no right. Would they go through anyone else's closet? Touch someones saints candle?    Talk to your husband about having a discussion with his sisters. If he agrees, have them over and tell them their behavior is something you would expect out of teenagers, not mature women. If not, give him some time. I'm sure he will get over it in soon.   (((Prairie Crone)))|`|fHfVRcqbaa	Quite honestly, he has seen who they are and what they are capable of (which is pretty bad).  The best you can do is to tell him what you have told us--that you don't want this to cause a rift and that you hope to remain a family with these people.  I think it is very gracious and big of you, by the way.  If your husband was as upset as you say he was, then I am sure they got the message that they crossed the line.  The bottom line is that no matter what you say, your husband will decide whether he wants these people in his life.  It may take him awhile to forgive them for violating your home in that way.|`|veZLfnGFaa	Tell your husband that you have no problem with what they did.  Then, call them and tell them that you are glad they are interested in your religiion and if they will come back over when you are home, you will explain it to them or answer any questions they might have.  ;)|`|ofBA1yF9aa	If you don't have anything to do with him not talking to them then so be it.  you don't want to force anything on him..  he doesn't want to talk  his choice..  let him know that your not all that mad  you don't mind it as much as he does  it was rude, wrong and all the above   but whats done is done  it's over with   and there is nothing you can do about it  he sounds rather disappointed in them and if he doesn't want to speak with them that's his choice not yours  he will eventually come around i'm sure  let him have his time to vent  but i think at the same time you need to ask them  how the would feel if you came over snooping threw there stuff  and disrespecting there house because what kind of honest "catholic"  would do such a thing?! Especially if they are bashing on what you believe in  And just tell them there not welcome over till they have an honest apology and until your husband feels like he wants to speak with them  nice and firm but serious does it with in laws  you cant be a sucker for people that are disrespecting you, your husband and your home.  good luck!|`|I814g6ZBaa	Tell your husband you love him beyond words for continuing to be your Knight.    Say nothing more to the sisters; he already had it out with them.  Just agree between the two of you that they are untrustworthy now and for always with regards to your personal space.  Yuck on them!!! :(  Change the locks on your house.    Your hubby is a keeper for sure!!  :)|`|fRIEHBJOaa	just tell him that you're upset, but willing to forigive and move pass this. just explain that you will now both set boundaries, such as they cannot go into your home without you guys there.  but in the end, it's his choice and i would stick by him, if he decides to ditch the meddling sisters.      personally, the b*tches wouldnt even be worth my time. i would let my hubby know that i'm willing to move on, but i wouldnt try to fight on their behalf. not worth an arugment w/ my man.    EDIT: i just want to say that you've been married to this man for 30 years (i read on your profile) and in 30 years i'm sure his sisters could've asked you questions about your religion, so it's obvious to me that they were be nosey and in doing so, violated your home and your trust.|`|nX1QW5GCaa	Talk to your husband about this first but I'd suggest the following.  Invite them over together (just the 2 of them).    You start the conversation by telling them that you have no problem answering any questions about your religion and would only be too happy to do so.  However, you have to tell them that you feel they have seriously violated and betrayed your trust by invading your personal property.  Ask them how they would feel if they had found you going through their closets and drawers without permission or their knowledge?  If you can get them to reverse the situation and get a sincere apology, consider the matter closed.  But, I still wouldn't give them access to my house again without being there.  :)|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	i agree it is out of line. i would go with your husbanmds thoughts and not talk to them for a while. there is no punishment worse then being ignored by your loved ones. let it all blow over and avoid talking to them for a few months. they know they messed up.|`|B1sT1t44aa	I would just let my husband handle it just the way he is because it's worse coming from him than coming from you. This is their brother and they violated your privacy after opening up your home to them. If they come and say anything to you about the situation I would just tell them you wish they had not done that. I am pretty sure that their brother is getting his point across about what is unacceptable in your home so leave it at that. They are the ones that are going to feel awful about it for a very long time and know your husband did good.|`|uuMCGT9taa	I would have ur husband tell his sisters they need to apologize to ur face and mean it and explain what they did was wrong and they have lost and and all privileges they once had, and how you will look at them as  sneaky people and thats what hurts the most that u cant trust them !|`|AA11460234	I can understand why your husband feels the way he does. But as cooler heads prevail you're wise in your attitude and feelings about this.    If they have questions about your beliefs then they should ask questions of you and not paw through your icons. I'd suggest you let them know in no uncertain terms that you're disappointed in them, but not to the degree of their brother.     Point out that it's a very un-Catholic thing to do and what would their opinion of you be if you went up and opened up the doors to the sacristy to take a peek inside. Maybe reached in and hefted the chalice and the hosts. Ask them if they'd be cool with that? Or would they have preffered that you asked them about these items versus handling them?    Your husband will cool down once you address the issue on your end. Of course you'd suggest to them that they have to speak with your hubby and air everything out. They were the ones who committed the infamnia and they'll have to square their problems with him on their own.|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	One, make sure your husband understands how much you appreciate him sticking up for you.  A lot of husbands would have blown it off.    Two, tell him that while you are offended by what they did and you agree it was totally unacceptable behavior on their part, it was not so grave an offence as to warrant breaking all communication.  This is about how they invaded *your* space, so if you're willing to continue contact, it seems kind of silly for your husband to push the issue.    On the flip side, it may be reasonable to ask for their keys back so it doesn't happen again.  Your husband might say something like "Sisters, I love you all very much, but what happened the other day was really, deeply inappropriate.  I really don't want my wife subjected to that again, so I think for the moment it would be best if you would give me back the keys to my house.  I still love you.  You're still welcome here, but that can't happen again."
iuSrMdwmaa	Renewing your vows (aka known as reaffirming your vows) means that you revisit them. You examine your marriage, and how it is doing. You look at what you promised on your wedding day. You celebrate the success of your marriage. And you say to one another: "My choice was a good one. I'm glad I made it. I would do it again in a heartbeat."    These are very powerful affirmations. Made in the presence of family and friends they are a celebration. Maybe even a little bit of showing off. In a world where half of all marriages end in divorce yours is making it. Good reason to celebrate.    And renewing your vows in front of a small group of family and friends - those people who are close to you and who have supported you in your marriage - makes it even more special.    Go for it - and plan to do it again at 8 years and 12 years or any year you like!|`|QJslTCUBaa	Why so soon? Just curious. :-)|`|6dbb12cad0e32f793a90d33f0e0c9ae1aa	i renew my vows every year on my anniversary-but its only me and husband present. unless there is some big compelling reason, why do you need others present?  if there is some reason and the family knows about it, then great. otherwise it seems to soon    but congratulations on your anniversary!|`|O46f8wl3aa	It's not typical...

So many people renew their vows as it they are getting married again for the first time or make it about a party.    If you personally have a reason for it- then it's up to you.  I know people whom have changed faith and decided to do it a little earlier then it's traditionally done.|`|ODYrypwaaa	I think every year should be celebrated!  4, 8, 10 or every year!  It's about you two.  So don't worry if it's socially ok.  Just don't ask for gifts.  Tee hee
LDv4dqLraa	Someone has told you of the flowers that accompany your birthday present haven't they?

Nah! What you should've said was "On a hot summer night would you lay out a blanket in the back yard surrounded by candles & make love to your significant other to whom bought you roses. Or, take the roses & your significant other by the hand & lead the way to the kitchen, put the roses on one side of the counter & rake whatever is in your way to the floor & rip off of clothing & go at it like wolves!" So, to answer your somewhat of a good question, hell yeah I'd make hot wolf sex to my husband & that is including "cubplay"(4-play)!!!
MHwn4Tlzaa	I have been happily married for over 17 years.  The sex in the last 4 or 5 years has gotten better than when we were first married and didn't have a kid.    I can't imagine my life without her.  She is the only woman I have ever had and I am the only man she has ever had.  I really think that has led to our successful marriage.  We were committed to finding only one person to make us happy.|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	While sex is at best revolting and at worse rather painful, it has to be endured, and has been by women since the beginning of time, and is compensated for by the monogamous home and by the children produced through it. It is useless, in most cases, for the bride to prevail upon the groom to forego the sexual initiation. While the ideal husband would be one who would approach his bride only at her request and only for the purpose of begetting offspring, such nobility and unselfishness cannot be expected from the average man.     ost men, if not denied, would demand sex almost every day. The wise bride will permit a maximum of two brief sexual experiences weekly during the first months of marriage. As time goes by she should make every effort to reduce this frequency.   eigned illness, sleepiness, and headaches are among the wife's best friends in this matter. Arguments, nagging, scolding, and bickering also prove very effective, if used in the late evening about an hour before the husband would normally commence his seduction.     lever wives are ever on the alert for new and better methods of denying and discouraging the amorous overtures of the husband. A good wife should expect to have reduced sexual contacts to once a week by the end of the first year of marriage and to once a month by the end of the fifth year of marriage.         y their tenth anniversary many wives have managed to complete their child bearing and have achieved the ultimate goal of terminating all sexual contacts with the husband. By this time she can depend upon his love for the children and social pressures to hold the husband in the home. Just as she should be ever alert to keep the quantity of sex as low as possible, the wise bride will pay equal attention to limiting the kind and degree of sexual contacts. Most men are by nature rather perverted, and if given half a chance, would engage in quite a variety of the most revolting practices. These practices include among others performing the normal act in abnormal positions; mouthing the female body; and offering their own vile bodies to be mouthed in turn.     udity, talking about sex, reading stories about sex, viewing photographs and drawings depicting or suggesting sex are the obnoxious habits the male is likely to acquire if permitted.        wise bride will make it the goal never to allow her husband to see her unclothed body, and never allow him to display his unclothed body to her. Sex, when it cannot be prevented, should be practiced only in total darkness. Many women have found it useful to have thick cotton nightgowns for themselves and pajamas for their husbands. These should be donned in separate rooms. They need not be removed during the sex act. Thus, a minimum of flesh is exposed.     nce the bride has donned her gown and turned off all the lights, she should lie quietly upon the bed and await her groom. When he comes groping into the room she should make no sound to guide him in her direction, lest he take this as a sign of encouragement. She should let him grope in the dark. There is always the hope that he will stumble and incur some slight injury which she can use as an excuse to deny him sexual access.     hen he finds her, the wife should lie as still as possible. Bodily motion on her part could be interpreted as sexual excitement by the optimistic husband.     f he attempts to kiss her on the lips she should turn her head slightly so that the kiss falls harmlessly on her cheek instead. If he attempts to kiss her hand, she should make a fist. If he lifts her gown and attempts to kiss her anyplace else she should quickly pull the gown back in place, spring from the bed, and announce that nature calls her to the toilet. This will generally dampen his desire to kiss in the forbidden territory.     f the husband attempts to seduce her with lascivious talk, the wise wife will suddenly remember some trivial non-sexual question to ask him. Once he answers she should keep the conversation going, no matter how frivolous it may seem at the time.     ventually, the husband will learn that if he insists on having sexual contact, he must get on with it without amorous embellishment. The wise wife will allow him to pull the gown up no farther than the waist, and only permit him to open the front of his pajamas to thus make connection.     he should be absolutely silent or babble about her housework while he is huffing and puffing away. Above all, she should lie perfectly still and never under any circumstances grunt or groan while the act is in progress. As soon as the husband has completed the act, the wise wife will start nagging him about various minor tasks she wishes him to perform on the morrow. Many men obtain a major portion of their sexual satisfaction from the peaceful exhaustion immediately after the act is over. Thus the wife must insure that there is no peace in this period for him to enjoy. Otherwise, he might be encouraged to soon try for more.     ne hearteni|`|5DJcir9saa	I have been only married for a year and half but we've been together for almost 9 years, living together for 8.  I love my husband very much and thoroughly enjoy being married.  Sure he does some annoying stuff at times, which I'm sure I do too, but you take the bad with the good.  Some people on here do have some pretty f-ed up lives but they put themselves in those situations.  I come from two parents who have been happily married for over 26 years.  I saw them work through rough patches and have everything work out in the end.  So I know that all the ups and downs in a marriage are totally worth it.    Why do I love my husband so much?  Because he's a great father and very hands on.  He always puts my needs first.  He likes to cook me dinner and rub my feet after work.  He's very supportive in everything I want to do.  He makes me feel like I'm the most beautiful woman around.|`|dc5bTUtmaa	Know what you mean. l don't know where you are but you could try listening to Steve Wrights Sunday Love Songs on BBC Radio 1 ( 9-11am ).

The relationship started out rough, my life was going down the drain, another woman was dragging me down with her, and then I meet my wife.  She was strong enough to see through the filth, and nudge.... kick me where I needed and made me get back up on my own feet.  She then told me I had to prove myself before there was any future between her and me.  I got my life back in order, my bills paid, and we got married.    Now, she was wise enough to let go and let me lead.  I am man of the house, but smart enough to ask for her opinions, and listen to her.  I love her with all my heart, and she the same to me.  I got her back when ever she needs me, and the feeling is great.|`|lq8YBCwzaa	Well this is not about me, however I am married. Okay so when my husband and I were at the car dealership, I was eavesdropping on this old couple, we will call them Dorothy and Norman. They were talking to one of the other car salesmen, and here is there story: Dorothy was saying how they were high school sweethearts and were even together after high school. Norman got drafted to go to war (Vietnam I think?). They wrote letters back and forth, but eventually he stopped writing her, and she moved on with her life. She got married to someone else. Then when he came back home, he also married someone else. They were married to these other people for probably at least 30 or 40 years. Then eventually she started banking at this bank, where his wife worked, and then they eventually started talking again, and became close friends again. So later on, Norman's current wife dies of old age, and so Dorothy divorces her husband. The two little old people got married and were together again. They had only been married for like 5 years at the time. They said these last years have been the best years of their whole life and they couldn't imagine what there life would have been like if they didn't reconnect. I thought that was the cutest story I had ever heard, except for the fact, that the little old lady just up and divorced her previous husband, but oh well, it was still romantic.
2o3BHgCCaa	Bridal shower is a gift grab for the home. You play tame games revolving around the bride or the couple and do girly things. Generally you stay home.    The Bachelorette party is more a celebration. A night to go out and have fun, some say the last night of freedom.  You drink and party and enjoy yourself generally out on the town.    Both parties are organised by the Maid of honour and the bridesmaids. The mothers may like to have some say in the bridal shower.    Gifts are only given at the bridal shower and you can do so whenever you like, it is probably easiest to give it straight away though. They go into a pile and the bride opens them with everyone there.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	This answer will vary slightly based upon where people are from.  (As I have found out reading through the posts over time).  So, I will give my answer based on my area (I'm from Chicago).  A bridal shower (also known as a weding shower) is for the couple and is a gift giving occasion (calling it a "gift grab" just makes it sound seedy, anyway...), in which the couple registers for gifts for the home.  The women of the family and female friends are invited to attend (not necessarily all the women invited to the wedding).  Here, the groom is always present as well, as it involves him and his family too.  Despite people's protestations about showers being thrown by family, showers here are 9 times out of 10 thrown by the mothers, with help from the bidesmaids.  The shower is typically given about 4-6 weeks before the wedding.    The bachelorette party is thrown by the bridal party and/or any other person who wants to host it.  It's an occasion for the bride to have fun with female family and friends and typically involves starting at someone's home for food,maybe games and gifts.  Here, the bachelorette party always involves some gifts ranging from tame pj's to risque items.  Then, the party will head out for a night out (activities vary).  The bachelorette party is usually thrown about 2-3 weeks before the wedding and often happens the same night as the bachelor party.    Again, this is how it's done where I'm from.    To add, a wedding gift (usually $) is also given at the wedding.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	well, you'd invite your mother's old aunt charlotte to the shower but you would NOT invite her to the bachelorette party!  lol  a shower is more family-friendly or kid-friendly, the bachelorette party is more of the bride-to-be's last fling before the wedding (but not too wild...you don't want to have any regrets or give him any reason for any either.  don't do anything you don't want him doing at his bachelor party!!)|`|gwindStOaa	Bridal Shower- for family and friends  Bachelorette Party- for bridesmaids, friends, and younger relatives that you want there who are probably close to your age......... and you have more fun.|`|DqetlSB6aa	Bridal shower- only females, play games, give wedding night appropriate gifts as well as gifts for JUST the bride. finger food, cake  held about 2 months before the wedding.  afternoonish maybe starts about 3:00  bachlorette party- usually the held 1 week to 1 day before the wedding.  no gift giving, maybe dinner or finger foods, maybe a dirty cake (depends on the type of bride you have) stripper, go out to the club, drink..basically a night out with the girls.  night time gathering.    We reserved a room at a local restaurant.  ate and then went to a club afterwords for my friends bachlorette party.  she didnt want a stripper.  And it was an easier clean up since we didnt have to do it.    bridesmaids or Ive also seen the mothers throw them.    A friend gave us all a great tasting wine we fell in love with.  Ive seen people give Bath and body works ( on sale right now) maybe something in sterling silver- a bracelet or pendant.    For groomsmen- monogramed mugs, money clips, lighter, keychain    All of these gifts were presented to us at the Rehersal Dinner|`|gRZT4pnUaa	The bridal shower is when people bring the wedding gifts and you unwrap them. Im just going to do that at the wedding to cut down on cost. The bachlorette party is when all the girls get together and have a party, open lingerie stuff like that. I think before the wedding or at the reception would be a good time to give the gifts to the bridesmaids or groomsmen. I think a purse, necklace, framed pic of shopping for the dresses for the bridesmaids. For the groomsmen engraved flasks.|`|XXw7DUDRaa	i dont know|`|T7ebpbg1aa	bridal shower is a quiet party and it is usually boring    bachlorette party is where the male strippers come in|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	A bridal shower is a gift giving party given for a bride before her wedding. The custom originated in the United States, although the first stories about these events have been known to originate in Brussels, Belgium around 1860. It remains a primarily U.S. and Canadian practice. Showers are usually coordinated by the bridesmaids, who invite guests to offer gifts for the home of the bride and groom.    The bachelorette party, hen party, hen do, or hen night, is a party held for a woman who is about to be married. The term hen party or hen night is more common in the UK, Ireland, and Australia, while the term bachelorette party is more common in the United States. The term stagette is used in Canada. It may also be referred to as a girls' night out or kitchen tea (South Africa in particular) or other terms in other English-speaking countries.    The bachelorette party is modeled after the bachelor party, which is itself historically a dinner given by the bridegroom to his friends shortly before his wedding.Despite its inaccurate reputation as "a sodden farewell to bachelor days" or "an evening of debauchery", a bachelorette's party is a normal party, given in honor of the bride-to-be, in the style that is common to that social circle. The name (and tradition) may have its origins in the middle-eastern traditions of the middle-east were "?ennah night" (Arabic: ???? ?????) is the women-only party prior to weddings with the bride painting Henna over her body and changing dresses throughout the party. Modern bachelorette parties tend to include food, entertainment and fun with the bride's closest girlfriends. It can include bar hopping, shopping, theater or even strip clubs.     Good luck!|`|bUN8FHRraa	A bridal shower is a gift giving party given for a bride before her wedding.  A bachelorette party, hen party, hen do, or hen night, is a party held for a woman who is about to be married.     This was from another response here:    A bridal shower is a party where you invite female friends and family (that are invited to the wedding) to an afternoon party. You serve food, you have a cake, the bride to be opens her presents. The whole point of a shower is to shower the couple with gifts. Normally the attendants and possibly the MOB pay for the shower.    A bachelorette party is where you invite female friends and family out to a bar or to Vegas for drinking and strippers and other debauchery. Normally you don't invite your Grandma or Mom, although I've seen both attend. Presents are involved but sometimes penis shaped straws are. Everyone pays for themselves at a bachelortette party, although the bride really shouldn't have to buy her own drinks.  I came from maigen_obx|`|kNscpF4Faa	Bridal shower is like a baby shower usually you get together for maybe a brunch or some cake get presents a bachelorette party is a girls night out..Go out drink maybe it is your last night a a single girl.|`|ODYrypwaaa	A bridal show is when you invite aunts, grandparents, neighbors, bosses, co workers etc.  You serve things like fruit, finger sandwiches, tea and coffee.  You play silly games like making a wedding dress out of toilet paper or bridal bingo.  This is usually thrown by the brides mom or maid of honor.  Bridal shower is done about two months ahead of the wedding.    Bachlorette party is a time to be wild (or silly).  This is thrown by the maid of honor or a good friend.  Usually clubs, drinks, dinner, and silly games with suggestive themes are played.  This is usually done a week or so before the wedding.    I like to give the bridemaid gifts at the bridal shower or the rehearsal dinner.|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	Both are usually given by the MOH and BM's the mom usually helps out with the shower too tho.   A bridal shower is a party where people "shower" the bride with gifts for thier new life together, usually home items. Usually done as a luncheon, maybe with games and prizes, etc.     A bachlorette is more for the bridal party and close friends of the bride and usually includes drunken women running around wild at clubs, bars., strip clubs, etc. and can include more racy games and dares than a bridal shower.     Either way, both are a blast!|`|zzqmbA19aa	A Bachelorette party is when your girlfriends get together and you all go out and party at a club, or even an amusement park.  It's a last hurrah.    A bridal shower is usually thrown by the mother of the bride and the maid of honor, and it used to be when the elder women would tell a new bride what to expect from their wedding night and also when they would give them house gifts and wife gifts; ie nightgowns, bedding, dishes,.    Nowadays the bachlorette party is for the drinking age friends of the bride and the bridal shower is for all ages.  Invite your granny to one but not the other (unless she is a very young cool granny).      Also you generally don't get gifts at a bachlorette party but do at a bridal shower.  And there are all types of games that women play at bridal showers.  Although recently there has been a trend to include the guys in the bridal shower business, which adds a new twist to it.    Oh and one last thing the bridal shower is usually when you recieve your wedding night outfit, or your garter and such.      Bridesmaid gifts are usually given at the bridal shower, although I've seen a few brides do it on the wedding day (which I personally think is too much).  Since the bachlorette party is all about the party atmosphere, it really isn't a great time to sit down and give out gifts.  A friend of mine didn't have a bachelorette party, she had a tea with just her bridesmaids- they dressed up, got hats, ate cake, etc.  I think the bridal shower is enough, you get to see everyone and they get to spend time with just you.    Have fun either way!|`|dGM0ButUaa	A bridal shower is where all the ladies included in the wedding and invited to the wedding get together to celebrate the marriage with a party and giving gifts to the new bride.  The bachlorette party is the brides last big party as a single lady.  I got my bridesmaids jewelry to go with their dresses that they could wear again and I gave it to them at the rehearsal dinner.  You could get them just about anything. Usually the maid of honor plans the parties with the help of the bridesmaids. Hoped this helped some! Congrats!
AA10549086	Men have a tendency not to let go. More of an ego thing in most cases. However, there is a chance it is not just ego..  If you IGNORE him long enough, he will let go.  Eventually he will find someone else and you will just be a memory for him.|`|2LAKDPc7aa	OMG I am in the same situation as you, I need to ask this same question, thanks.|`|oGzS4vhNaa	Sit him down and actually talk about. He may really like you. I did that to someone once....and I stopped because he called me a really mean name,|`|XkidpdPWaa	Bare knuckle fight.
S5H0NmEWaa	You can wear whatever you damn well please, you're the bride.    but do think of the future, when you're showing your wedding photographs to your grandchildren.    You don't have to look like a meringue, but you might find something more timeless than black leather, more feminine than leather trousers, and more elegant than a red satin corset.    On the other hand, it'll be memorable.|`|RIjjibnwaa	Wear whatever you want - it's your wedding.  If you mother in law to be doesn't approve, tell her to get the fu*k out :-)|`|DqetlSB6aa	Girl, wear what YOU want.  It would be YOUR wedding if you didnt.|`|gm9ZOaKEaa	is your wedding why are u asking what you can and cant do?|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	you can wear whatever you want, but just keep in mind that these are pictures you will show your kids and grandkids on 40-50 years. What will you think looking back at them? Maybe you can compromise and wear a dress in another color, or sexier style that is non-traditional but not as trashy looking?|`|QJslTCUBaa	Don't embarrass your family. :-)|`|iuSrMdwmaa	Only you can know whether it is something you're likely to regret in the future. Just the fact that you're asking the question suggests that you are in two minds already.    Here are some questions that might help you decide:    - Would wearing something so unwedding-like focus your guests attention on your outfit and away from the beauty of your commitment to each other and the words of the ceremony?    - Is your outfit the only untraditional touch in your wedding or will the whole thing be untraditional?    - How will you dress your bridesmaids? Will what they will be wearing coordinate in style, color etc with this outfit?    - What does your fiance think about it?    - What is it about this wardrobe choice that really appeals?    It is your wedding, and the choice is yours but if your family and friends reactions would turn your wedding into a circus you might want to reconsider and look for other ways to add elements of unique style to your wedding.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	It's your wedding.  You wear what you want.  If you are not a white flouncy dress person then don't force yourself to wear something you are not going to be comfortable in.|`|v0fooLeTaa	Because you have felt the need to ask us it indicated to me that you feel like you might regret it....although you might not be aware of this. I think that it is best to wear the leather trousers after the ceremony for the reception. For the ceremony I would wear a more traditional wedding dress although it doesnt have to be white!  http://www.herecomestheguide.com/blog/de...    Here are some dresses to inspire you:      A simple white gown with a v-neck. The good thing about this dress is that you can wear a colourful necklace with it and its not too traditional. http://album.weddingcentral.com.au/galle...    On this website: http://www.culture-shock.com.au/br.htm  click on Megan. She is wearing a white gown with a bold red pattern on it.    Have a look at this site: http://www.culture-shock.com.au/cb.htm  they have a massive range of dresses and they have some cool twists of the traditional dress. Worth a look at = )    http://www.brideonline.com.au/gallery/br...    http://weddings.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Colo...

I have always thought that i would love a black wedding dress...have you ever thought about that?|`|nqINitkmaa	Its your wedding do as you please. Personally I think that is in poor taste, but if it is a reflection of you and thats what you want to do then go for it. Yes I do think you will regret not doing the whole white wedding thing.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	I think this is a little OTT, save it for your wedding night.|`|6UKd0Gedaa	no, trashy sorryx|`|2o3BHgCCaa	It's not something I would ever consider, but if it is your style then go ahead.    I think the question you have to answer is:  Which will you regret more if you don't wear it; the leather pants and corset or the white wedding dress?|`|AA11603468	Only you would know whether you would regret not having a real wedding to look back on. This is a one-shot deal, so if you have any idea that you might feel regretful or foolish 20 years from now about not having a more traditional wedding, then don't.     I know that for me, the thing that made our wedding the day of my dreams was that we only observed the traditions that meant something to us personally. We ignored those we didn't care about, and had a wedding that was meaningful for us-not for anyone else-for us.     I think the outfit sounds like a pirate outfit, which as a bride, I don't think I'd go for, but again, you do the things that are special to you, and that you will look back on with fond memories, and if that means wearing leather pants and a corset, then that's what you do.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	If that is what you want to wear then do so. No one can decide for you if you will regret it or not. Alot of women don't want the white dress and very few actually regret it.|`|2esGKO2Caa	It's your party do what you want|`|4d163081b2e7d60145dd97484dd14342aa	You can wear whatever you want - its YOUR wedding!!!  Don't let other people tell you what to wear - if you're most comfortable and feel better in leather trousers and a corset then go for it!|`|GGfLLgkXaa	Trashy.  Maybe for your wedding night ?|`|EsvJ9ji3aa	you can do whatever  your want because it's your big day but when you look back 20 years from now you might regret not doing it the traditional way. unless leather has a lot to do with your life like you are a hard core harley lover and ride all the time i would say don't do it. you will probably regret it if you want your could do the regular wedding dress for the wedding and all the big dances at the reception and then change for the rest of the dancing but make sure your man changes and matches you some way. congrats and take it all in because it goes by so fast.|`|CsFVuq87aa	Its you're wedding, so don't care what other people think or approve of, you hopefully wont do it again so do it exactly how you want, good luck x|`|s6stLtvLaa	You can wear what you want....but I think this is an outfit best saved for the bedroom.....If you want to do something other than a white dress, then where a black and red dress....You can find one that would be form fitting.  I have seen this style done and it looked very nice.....In the end the choice is yours.|`|gRZT4pnUaa	It's your wedding and i think you should wear what you feel comfortable in. If you let others decide what you should do you'll never be happy. Ask the bridesmaids and your soon to be husband what they think of not wearing a dress. They know you better and could probably give you a better answer.|`|975eba47309760d643b6478d2e5d9bf2aa	its your wedding lol, do what ever you want|`|HZuLVEEsaa	Yes you can, you should wear whatever you want, as to whether or not you'd regret it, only you know that.|`|CoNRevnraa	You can wear whatever you want since it's your own wedding, but I wouldnt wear that.|`|ODYrypwaaa	IT would be fun, but I think you might regret it later.  Do a white dress for the ceremony and the leather for the reception...or even for the wedding night.|`|iDjp5eKGaa	I think if you are entering a union with the sole intention of annoying your loved one's  mother then you might want to rethink your decision to get married.    I am all for wearing what you want on your wedding day. I can even empathize with not getting along with your soon to be husband's mother, but purposely pushing her buttons is immature.|`|tyl9aSu9aa	Do YOU think you're going to regret it? And how does your fiance feel?    If you both think you'll be happy about it down the line, then go for it, have fun with it, and don't look back.    If you like it, and he likes it, that should be enough for you.|`|mbv2jLqDaa	Mmm...that's not very traditional or contemporary but it's your wedding, you can do whatever you like.  You may or may not regret it, that depends.  If you are reluctant on the whole ordeal, then you will most likely regret it.  I can't see why anyone would want to wear leather pants and a corset to their own wedding, I think people should dress in a special way to accommodate the occasion.  But hey, to each their own.|`|c1379040fcc5c4a581798d49a39f2446aa	its your wedding,, or funeral

4hkM3HXyaa	GoJo or Fast Orange will clean his hands up. Buy some and insist he use it.|`|AA11982228	Treat him to a sexy manicure.  Put on something real sexy, some nice music, some simmering oil, soft lights...and then use the orangewood stick around and under his nails...get a pumice stone to use on his rough, stained hands and rub them gently to remove the discolorations...follow with a nice unscented lotion.  All the while, slithering around his body, rubbing up against him, whispering sexy things...He'll love it and won't think about anything else.    Keep in mind, though, that as much as you might find it a turn off to see his hands in that condition, a professional mechanics rough hands help protect him from the dangerous environment of his job and many men wouldn't like to be without their rough hands.    It might be best to just get used to it and be thankful he has a job!|`|ZR34thBvaa	Fussy *****.|`|h3uUzhtiaa	You might have to just tell him straight up.. Ther is kind of no way around that.|`|toLCaFc9aa	Does he uses Gojo at work? My husband worked as a welder and he would be dirty all the time, but if you use Gojo at a regular basis y does wonders.|`|pW9KhTFvaa	He's a friggin mechanic.  Give him a break.  His job involves being in dirt, grease, and oil all day and some is sure to get under his nails each and every day.  Congrats on taking some initiative to clean up his nails for him as he probably needs it and it will give you a sense of satisfaction.  I say ease up on him during the work week and when you two are going out on the weekends, offer to clean his hands for him.  Eventually he will learn the proper way to do it and will probably end up doing it himself to keep you happy.|`|J3JClsuQaa	My fiancee is a mechanic too!  It is nasty looking.  There are special scrubbing soaps you can buy or make, cheap...    Tough grime deserves tough soap. Here's a cheap and easy recipe for mechanic's/ gardener's soap:    Difficulty: Easy  Time Required: 5 minutes or less  Here's How:       1. Fill an empty container with dish soap  enough for one hand washing or enough to wash your hands a bunch of times. The choice is yours.       2. Then, add corn meal to the soap  just a sprinkle for a small batch and as much as a tablespoon for a big batch.       3. Stir the mixture up, and rub a bit between your fingers to test the grittiness.       4. Add corn meal (if needed) until you reach the right consistency.       5. Use immediately, or store in an air-tight container for future use.    What You Need:        * Dish soap      * Corn meal      * An empty container    I found this recipe online, it looked a lot simpler than others, but I have never used it, but thinking about trying it now... if it works, it will be cheaper than store bought soaps...Oh and even after he scrubs there is still a little discoloration he says there's nothing that can be done about it ??  If ya find something let me know...  : )|`|uVH046Fjaa	If he's a mechanic I don't think he's too sensitive about how his hands look. He probably won't care.|`|2axrY4lkaa	dont say ewwwwwww they are sooo disgusting just say oh these need a clean out i will see what i can do.|`|a35c4a3ab714036bfd3c31e133920f9caa	tell him he can not touch you with dirty hands...  how did you start to date him in the first place?  didn't you notice the dirt?|`|CZFcH1ykaa	It won;t hurt his feelings. Get FAST ORANGE cleaner at Auto Zone. Promise that will clean his hands and its cheap|`|tzNqAWhdaa	Just tell him if he really wants to keep them clean he will do whatever you suggest, they have a fingernail brush at wal mart try that|`|YbwDFvEaaa	There are several companies out there that produce soaps especially for men who work with their hands and struggle to keep their hands clean-looking after working outdoors or on greasy machinery. It's a common problem for men, and if he's brought it up before, it may actually bother him, himself. I mean, he's letting you clean his nails with an orange stick, he can't be oblivious to it!    In my sources I've placed the link for a "manly" soap brand made especially for men. The soap is gritty, and so it exfoliates the hands to help remove the stained skin. Just leave a bar in the bathroom and near the kitchen sink, or where ever he normally washes his hands and I'm sure he'll be happy to use it.    Good luck!|`|41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	Hurting his feelings? What about him potentially killing you?     Female partners of car mechanics statistically have increased incidences of cervical cancer: That's correct, the small amounts of grease and mineral oil are transmitted from the fingers, to the cervix and instigate cancer.      He can use gloves everytime he works on a car, you know those latex gloves used in laboratories and hospitals? No excuses about them ripping or costing money, if he cares for your and his health he'll use them.     If he continually uses them, then he'll greatly reduce his exposure to grease and oil and it'll keep his fingers clean.     Alternatively get a new boyfriend who doesn't put your health quite so much at risk.|`|4myG3rbKaa	ONE OF MY GOOD FRIENDS IS A MECHANIC AND EVERY YEAR WHEN WE GO TO THE BEACH THE SALT WATER CLEANS THEM.

It really depends on what kind of relationship you both have.|`|FwLBIDpYaa	To be honest, motor is very hard to wash off. I fix on my car sometimes and yes, it's very ugly. If your honey always works on cars, don't bother cleaning his nails. He'll just get them dirty again. Just make sure he's washing his hands often. That way he's germ free. Maybe not motor oil free, but germ free.|`|OhaJV30Waa	give the guy a break, hes working and that's a great sign!!  hes working with grease and dirt, of course hes gonna have dirty hands and finger nails.  If it bothers you that much maybe you might say, hey honey, I know how hard you work, maybe you'd like a nice hand massage?  i bet your hands would really enjoy one!!  and then get out your little basket of goodies, hand cleaner, Orange stuff from Auto Zone works great, a little hand mas sager, some nail files, and whatever else you want to use to improve his hands and get to work.  And give him the best hand massage hes ever had so the next time you need to clean his hands he wont even hesitate to say no!!  and that way, you both win, clean hands for a moment, cause they're gonna get dirty all over again, hes a mechanic!!  and he doesn't get his feelings hurt or made to feel ugh.  :-)   good luck!!|`|QO6Abf0iaa	Gee! He should just wash his damn hands and that's it!
mCHSSvw6aa	Do something original. plan a road trip and go somewhere fun, i don't really know any cool places to go in your area but, i'm sure you could think of something fun to go see, do you like the outdoors, if so, you could go hiking somewhere if it isn't too cold. I've found that sometimes the best types of dates are just ones where you let loose and do whatever you feel like. You could go see a movie (but that's kinda over done and gets boring) but i suggest doing something adventurous!|`|Fh76mMuUaa	go bowling|`|fXzed3fLaa	Go to see My Bloody Valentine 3D|`|XqAWm9Yjaa	I agree with them|`|OsQkpljLaa	I agree with the bowling idea.

Sometimes they may not know that it hurts your feelings so much, maybe express your hurt feelings so they will know it bothers you. stop running to your mom b/c she may say something to themand then they will know it was u that told on them. I'm sure they don't hate you, maybe jealous that you are your Mom's Angel. Maybe try to be mature and talk to them about it.

Find something you can do that pulls you out of the house more often, like go to the mall, hang out with friends, go swimming, play tennis, get a job, volunteer, or just get a longer school schedule and stuff like that.  If you also have a lock on your door then you could just sit in there and read or do homework, or listen to the radio.  You just have to wait it out until they leave.

You must tell your lawyer, you want an immediate change to your child custody order and that you want TEMPORARY CHILD CUSTODY , so that she follows through the terms.

Show that you can be responsible for the safety and well being of your child and they will let you see him/her outside of the supervision when they (the court) feel it is appropriate.

So here's where I come in.. Im engaged and I always wondered that question too.. I've decided that living together is part of the EXPERIENCE of getting to know each other MORE and doing all the fun little things together that you didn't do before... Its your choice, but I feel like, its best to get married and then move in because then you can learn each other along the way. If you two have been in a relationship for a while, then you can talk about the things he does in the morning, how he feels about responsibilities in the house and etc.. My fiance' and I made a game out of it and I learned alot by doing that. Just ask.. but ultimately, the choice is yours..|`|uUuOAXcEaa	I believe you should live with each other before you get married. you have to know everything about each other.

I lived with my ex-husband for 4 years before we got married.  It was good.  Then we got married and it all went to hell.|`|AA11091233	Speaking from experience....I have vowed to never live together until we are married. You get to know each other better by living separately until you are married...because once you are living together, there doesn't seem to be a call for marriage. It is far better to know each other well by living apart...I really feel this. It gives you time to reflect on if this person is really the person you want to spend your life with. If you are a woman in particular...the guy often, not always, but often feels no need to get married...as he already has what he wants..without the final commitment...and the woman often feels an underlying resentment or hurt feelings that he doesn't want to get married...and often uses the line 'it's just a piece of paper'. But that isn't true.     You also have to be careful, as a lot of people living together do so 'to save money' on rent or owership, or they live closer to work...those types of reasons. Practical reasons. And that is never the right reason to move in together and will end in disaster...as someone's intentions were not pure of heart.    It only works IF BOTH parties don't care about a legal marriage and feel that living together is all they want. But as a woman, who has lived with men before...I will  just say...never again. I will find the man who can't wait to call me his wife.    Take care.|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	live together then get married so you know how they hold up there end of the deal with the house like keeping it clean|`|0udjgaoBaa	You dont know someone until you live with them!|`|MRpSUNNhaa	I would say live together first cos then you can see how the  person is when you live with them... what if they were a total slob and you were a neatfreak and married them without knowing that?  that'd be terrible for you.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	live together then marry|`|N3WtiNDRaa	get married and then live together   but you probably want to live together at least a little while before you get married casue you want to get to know each other you really dont want to marry the wrong person    ...so both?   live together and get married i think.....ya thats it :0|`|cIBqQ0QEaa	I think it's better to get married, then live together.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	i dont think it matters as long as your committed to each other, but if you're moving in to save on rent or hope that moving in will improve your relationship, then you're not ready for marriage    in regards to each other's habits, you should figure that out when you go to each other's homes. so you'll know if he's sloppy or doesnt like to clean etc...you can tell those kinda things. especially if you each have your own apt., before lving together, which me and my fiance did, so i wasnt suprised by much.     basically, to each his own. i wouldnt bother living with someone, unless i wanted to marry that person. also, i would (and did) get my own independent and lived w/ my friends before moving in w/ him. best decision ever.    i'm living w/ my fiance|`|GOUgocyAaa	i did a whole project on this and it was found that couples are more successfull and have a better chance of staying together long term if they live together before getting married. This is because they already know what it is like to live with that person and be with them all the time, so it won't be surprising after you are married. Often, people act different in their own home than they do if they are a guest somewhere. you get to know a person intimately living with them. All their quirks, disgusting habits, etc. Alot of times, living together can make or break a couple.     Alot of people don't believe in living together for religious reasons or because it was just the way they were brought up. It's just my personal opinion that living together first is a good idea, but it's not for everyone.|`|7382e6436bbca0c2034d94d4e72448aeaa	Statistically you have a 50% higher chance of getting divorced if you live together before you get married.    Plus, it is well.....immoral to live together without being married.  And results in more children being born to single parent households.|`|7ygicWvzaa	Get married FIRST!  The problem with living together (especially purchasing property together) before you get married is if things don't work out, now you have to split everything without the power of the law.  People end up getting themselves into sticky situations like this.  At least if you are married that means there is a contratual agreement for everything in the marriage so if there is a split -- divorce is the law behind you.  (whether fair or not).|`|FAQldsUZaa	My husband and I lived together before we got married. I think it's better that way. It lets you really get to know them before taking that big step. What happens if you dont move in together until after you marry and you come to learn that he isnt the man you want to spend the rest of your life with?? Just my opinion!!|`|cVhuFVWSaa	For me, I would definitely have to live with a person before I married him.  You really don't know people if you've never lived with them. I guess if you are staying at eachothers houses a lot and it seems like you live in the two places it would be fine to get married and move into one of your places. I just wouldn't feel like I knew him enough to marry him if I hadn't lived with him for a couple of years. So my opinion wouldn't work for those that only date for a few months before getting married, but To Each His Own, right?|`|4NcshCDvaa	get married first!!!!|`|77ZVd5hyaa	It really doesn't make much of a difference to me.

You wanna be certain you know what you are getting into before you plunge into a commitment where 50/50 comes into play when it doesn't work out.

Being a friend is more important because it will become the backbone of any relationship, where ever it leads.  Since you both have these strong feelings, if you are there when he needs you, he will see what a strong support system he does have and appreciate you all the more.|`|4hkM3HXyaa	Could be confused.

xQn3rR6Naa	Honey, this is really hard because people who are "supposed" to love you are having none of it because they can't see anything except that "you aren't like them". That doesn't make it any easier, but remember they are from a place in time where racial purity was everything and it was shameful for everyone if you weren't bearing a child who was within your race. Your sisters can pass and that is why they don't evoke the same reaction. You will have to accept the fact that old people aren't going to change but, you can move ahead. Find your talent. God gives each of us talents we don't always know what they are but we have to keep working to look into ourselves, take a chance and develop who and what we are. When you find out what you are really good at, it won't matter to you what other people think.   Your mother is also from the Asian culture. Respect for elders is drummed into you from day one. That makes it very hard for her to stand up against them even though she needs to. She also was taken off guard when they just "showed up" However, if you give her this letter that you have written, she should demand respect for you, her home and herself while her parents are in your home. He words should leave no room for misinterpretation, My son is my son and I love him just as much as my other children. If you can not treat him equally then it is time for you to find a hotel to stay in for the remainder of your visit. I would suggest that she also return any gifts that were purchased for your sister. I can only think that she may be accepting financial assistance from them as a reason to accept how you have been treated. She should apologize for her weakness and although these are still her parents, she should now act as an adult who must protect her child.   As for moving, sometimes that can not be avoided. She should be told how hard that is for you too. Mom's sometimes think that boys are stronger and not so affected by things like moves but being of mixed racial background makes you feel at a disadvantage when trying to fit in.   I know that I haven't been able to help you much. i am sorry for your pain. Hold your head up though because you sound like a caring and awesome kid. Good luck.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	racism is common in Asia and they are rude and unworthy of your love or respect but as for what I want you to do is to be so sweet and polite to them that you cause their blood sugar to go up.    From where you stand this is the only way for you to prove yourself but if your return what they are passing out you will be sinking to their level and then they will feel that they had judged you rightly.   Hang in there and when ever you feel like you are about to blow , go outside and run for a while and burn off your anger and never give them the pleasure of seeing that they are getting to you.   Good luck and remember that they will go home soon|`|sPxmH9yQaa	I want to help. Where are you moving to? I live in Florida.

Since they are forcing you to go to church with them.  remind them that God is not a racist.  The same blood flows through everyone's veins.    Your mom was taught in her culture that women are second class citizens with no right to talk back to their "superiors"  that's part of why she can't defend you.  My heart goes out to you and I want to help carry your hurt honey.  Please look within yourself and know that you were created for a very special reason and God Truly loves you and he wants you to be happy.  Try to hold on through this horrible visit and be glad when their gone and grateful you haven't had to put up with them for these last 7 years.|`|17MZkNpZaa	i would try to sit down with them and your mother and letting them all know that you didn't ask to come here and you cant help who you are but just because they are your grandparents it is not okay for them to come into your life and make you feel worthless. and then i would let your mother know that it really bothers you that at such a tough time in your life she is not defending you nor is she being supportive.

The most important this appreciating what they gave you. Guys are simple. Dont over do it. With man its different. I know myself i have something at every level. Some ladies have went all out and not having a budget on valentines day and some people have a budget. I would like something very original. A nice watch that you know ive been looking for. Shows me you were paying attention when we were together. Or if its cold, a leather coat, and gloves. If you really want to get creative have his initials on the jacket somewher. It all depends how far you want to go. But a dinner is a good start at his favorite restaruant. And petes sakes, dont argue or whine that day about anything.|`|0dEaFrFOaa	home made treats.

wP480B6Waa	Sounds like he is in control of your life. ANd that he doesn't care about how you feel. You should tell him your going to Atlantic City and that it was a gift to yourself for V-day.  Just tell him how you feel about this whole gift giving. If he doesn't listen to you then mabey you shouldn't be with in the first place since he doesn't take your feelings into consideration.|`|76nTvO4iaa	You've been talking to this guy for two years about what you expect and it's not happening, so I can't give him the benefit of the doubt for being clueless..    He's either selfish, passive-aggressive or stupid.   Get ready for a life of disappointment if you tie up with him long term.    I think you need to move on.|`|fe8RxYsfaa	I'd consider dumping him.  "It's always what he wants to do or what he says."  That is no way to live.  I tried it for 16 years.  Finally divorced the guy.  There is no happiness there.  Sometimes it nees to be about you.|`|6W9vXKmFaa	sorry but if the guys not getting the hint tell him staright out how your feeling tell him if you can't treat me right where over. if he dosen't listen after dump him.|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	Since you've already expressed your desires to him and they are ignored, you have two options:    1) Continue to put up with this insensitive jerk and complain about it forever and feel miserable.    2) Break up with him and find someone more suitable for you.|`|1222934eb4a1550f62a11a8f057ae622aa	i hink he sounds liek a selfish prick and you should lose him. and dont analyze because no offense but by your three paragraph rant it seems like you will overanalyze. find a guy who knows what you want without you having to drop hints or say it blatantly. even a guy who you need to drop hints for and hell actually "get it" is better then wasting any more time on this loser. maybe hell take you to a basketball game.....you know courtside:) jk|`|NTOhm9HBaa	if he's been like that all along, that's kind of what you agreed to put up with. If you don't like it, move on. But if he doesn't know he is doing anything wrong, and you aren't willing to tell him, you can't piss and moan about it. BTW, nothing says you can't take him out to dinner, right? Or just get him chocolates
UYkVsJMUaa	i would suggest anywhere from 23 to 31 or so.. honestly though, age doesnt matter.. your gonna find guys with one thing on their minds at all kinds of ages. and there are some guys closer to your age then 40 that are ready to settle down and know how to treat a girl, they are just harder to find.|`|76nTvO4iaa	25 - 40|`|AA11209233	You seem to be anxious to get married, so you probably should be looking at guys almost or over thirty--the ones who are starting to think of kids as something they want soon, not someday.  If that isn't true, you may want to get your age prejudices out of your head.  If you keep expecting guys your age to be disrespectful and older guys to be more respectful, that's what you'll always see--even when you meet a great guy your age or an older jerk.      I see this thinking with people who always date outside their race.  They say ____ people (people with the same race as the speaker) are one way and ____ people are so much better, more respectful, etc.  When in fact, that just applies to the few people they have dated, and may not have even been true of them--it could have been her perception or the way they presented themselves.|`|mAPSl0DZaa	Age is but a number to some extent. I think maturity goes further. I was 27 my hubby 22 when we met. He persued me but he was very mature in his age and so it worked.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	i'd say 27-30, bc then they are in the same place, basically, kids and work wise.     but if someon e special comes along, it wont matter if they are 22 or 42, itll just be right|`|pX8qJzjIaa	Hey, just wanted to tell you all guys dont just want sex.  I personally would rather just spend my time wih the girl and make her feel important.  There will be someone who treats you right and maybe he will be older, but dont close yourself off to guys your age or even a little younger.  Some of us actually do care about what you want :)  Hope it helps.
40qTdKuPaa	Usually people that date that long always get back together. Me and my Boyfriend broke up after 3 years, and one week later he was on his knees begging me to come back. Girl, hes coming back, just wait it out, and never shed a tear over a guy, specially one that you know is coming back! Hope this helps.|`|MjkDTovqaa	You stand up, you lift one leg and put it past the guy. Then when that one foot is down and steady you do the same with the other leg.    And you keep doing that till your heart and soul are safe and sound..    It would help to take your time, map out your course, know your limits and NEVER regress.|`|AA10907244	I'm a guy and I cried like a lil' puss for a few weeks after getting dumped (2.5 years).    You're young - the pain will be gone sooner than you think.    The best thing you can do is hang out with friends and workout. Working out REALLY helps!|`|iTUugOTLaa	There's no particular way to get over someone. Crying can help, closing your eyes and sticking your face in a pillow to shout out stuff helps. But if there's one particular thing that helps me overcome stuff is to talk to myself as if I'm two people, out loud. Let your subconscious be convinced of what you want by talking to yourself in second person.    And the ultimate cure though, is time. Give it time, enjoy your life.    cheers|`|a35c4a3ab714036bfd3c31e133920f9caa	the best way to get over something old is to get under something new.     just move on, hang out with friends distract yourself from thinking about it.  it will take time but you will be fine.  good luck|`|8ACdEaC5aa	get rid of everything that reminds you of him... pictures, books, places that remind you of him dont go there... get a new hobby, go out more, get a new bf, listen to this song .

My girlfriend of over two years broke up with me several months ago, and it bothered me for a long time. But, after a while, I just realised that she was a different person now, and the girl I loved is gone. I feel way better about it now. after a while, you'll realise that it'll all be fine, it just takes a while.  It also helps to talk to close friends about it, and stay positive and open-minded.|`|iqrXIQctaa	You need to try and stay busy sweety, I went through the same thing when I left my bf of 4 years. Try your best to keep your mind off of him. If you know he is bad for you then you need to keep reminding yourself of all the bad things he does to you. Don't get suckered back in. Be Strong!|`|Y4lA8S84aa	gO OUT AND dANCE aT a cLUB Or SOmeThING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|q9qWHXcLaa	it does help to cry crying makes you feel better just cry it off until you feel better you'll find another guy|`|zWX5GDehaa	It usually always helps me to say that you're better off without that guy and that there's a better guy out there for you. Unlesss you see yourself not getting over him, try talking to him about it.|`|GTvyBTGyaa	Just cry and let it all out you'll feel better eventaully.|`|V0uzsE6kaa	The problem with getting over relationships is that any answer that provides an outcome seems unbearable.  The first thing you need to do is stop contacting him.  Don't answer his calls, don't respond to emails or IM, and definitely DO NOT see him.  This sounds terribly hard, but it gets easier as time goes on.  The longer you go without hearing from him, the better you will feel.      People tend to push their problems aside and never deal with them, which prolongs the pain when getting over someone.  If you jump right into another relationship or keep yourself so busy that you never think about it, you won't have time to heal.  Surround yourself with good people who will listen to your thoughts.  There's nothing anyone can say or do to make you feel better but sometimes it helps just to say your problems out loud and have someone listen.  Also take time to yourself to reflect on things and keep asking yourself questions.  You'll figure them out eventually.    I just recently got over my last relationship and it took me a good year plus to do it.  If you ever just need someone to talk to, IM me.  I'm always willing to talk.|`|d5W2hDGsaa	First off i will say take the time and know you first and what important to you. Guys just come and go, back and fourth. Think about what cause you guys to break up in the first place and see is it worth it or not and if not ,just move on with your life, and a guy or a girl is not worth your tears just learn from the better.I been there done that you will be okay and he for what ever reason he will be back trust me and just go with your gut instinct.|`|4myG3rbKaa	eat loads of ice cream|`|CeqrPSqqaa	don't try and get over him just let life take its course its okay to feel sad but sooner or later your life will get back on track and you will be over him these things just take time. so for right now just do what you enjoy and try and keep your mind off of him. hope this helps :)|`|e3MMRGYXaa	Awww... I know exactly how you feel. Best thing to do is start making your life without him. Spend lots of fun time with your friends and do your thing. It will take a while but you WILL get over it... so, start working on it babe.|`|3zd5Zd0laa	What is with you people.. telling this girl her boyfriend was a "loser"? How do you know? Maybe he had a reasonable explanation for breaking up with her.. and guys do NOT always come back.. this could be the end for you..|`|auUeI2Vnaa	You get caught up in friends, family and hobbies so that you aren't dwelling on how awful you feel.  You'll feel better with time.|`|km5e0hfsaa	it will not be easy dear and you will go through many emotions, but it is best to do what is best for your selves, allow your emotions have quiet time, make list, of why the relationship is over, spend time being busy remembering what you love, allow yourself to feel the pain you are not a robot, but constantly remind  your self how important it is for you to heal and dont rush into another relationship dont use another man to heal|`|RWpZmTOeaa	get a new bf|`|OUBKWrf2aa	just dont think bout it and move on, life is too short to dwell on ONE guy when there r other billion guys out there u can find|`|XoYHF1RLaa	go out with your girlfriends to a club and meet new guys.|`|6RiLrsuBaa	go out with someone else.  or just have sex with someone else.|`|pWA3gybAaa	find a new guy|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	You go on with your life and hang out with your friends while doing things that you enjoy to do until you stop thinking about him. It'll take time but it'll happen.    Time heals all wounds.
NuUdCz0Laa	Apparently you have found someone that loves it and wishes to show you how much she enjoyed it by being extra nice to you.  Now that you have set the standards it will be up to you to continue.  So do not do like others and when the ring goes on the finger and they say I do, then they stop and say I don't have to anymore, so break the chain and stay down below and treat her special.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	dude, obviously you've mistaken women as same shallow pieces of sh*t that us men are.     no.|`|uXeGsxSVaa	I honestly don't think that it's the oral sex. I think it's the time that passed between you two and the closeness that grew, which incidentally also occured around the time you started to have sex.|`|AA11460234	Nah.....I got the same reaction from her before you. She's just a good kid, that's all.|`|gM4exZNEaa	It could make your relationship more fun and exciting in the intimacy department, but the fact that she is more affectionate is derived from the fact that you have been together for a while. Relationships grow and those in the relationships grow closer to each other on a daily basis. The sex may have impacted it a bit, because she feels more confident that you wont think shes bad in bed or reject her, because obviously she would've been a bit worried seeing as she hasn't had a partner in a while. Maybe you made her feel good about herself?|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	It sounds like you are a real master at it.  Keep it going, she's treating you like a king.|`|zspVPoLZaa	idk, good luck with that!!!!|`|6aVtiTKiaa	I don't necessarily think it's that act in particular that made her feel closer to you.  Just being considerate in bed in general can make a big difference.  Especially if she's not used to that.  It's not everything, but it's a lot.
1l04qpOKaa	Try to contact the agency that they were adopted through. Thats all I got, good luck!  :o)
oMGasIcjaa	How would she not know she was your mother....did she not give birth to you??|`|7dGpL4mSaa	Maybe you should explain to your mom that Muslims are great people and that we are not like all people say about us. I would love her because she is my mother, but no matter what happens, never leave Islam, even if she hates you, cuz you know that it's the right path!        Salam|`|veZLfnGFaa	Yes :)|`|npA75Obvaa	Yes.|`|23585477d134924ef116219788e29d68aa	I would still love her, maybe she just hate what some Muslim's do or how they act.  Maybe she needs to meet the right Muslim, you!  Good Luck!|`|AA11635143	My mother is dead and I still love and miss her.  You didn't give enough information to receive good answers.  From this point, I can only say that you need to give love (and your mother) a chance.  You don't have to tell her anything about your religion unless you are looking for a fight.  All you need to do is to tell her that you are her child if you are absolutely sure that you are.|`|8qVkSA4jaa	....?? How would she not know you are her child?|`|wNY3P6jEaa	yea but wat u have 2 do is get her 2 know that she may hate muslims but u r her child and she should luv u no matter wat religion u choose|`|O46f8wl3aa	I'm confused as to how your mom wouldn't know that you are Muslim... But I'm sure you mom probably has some kind of media hyped propoganda image of Muslims. Yes I would still love her, and if I were you I'd tell her you're Muslim and then TRY to have a sit down talk with her to explain your religion.
VSb6S6muaa	when you genuinely love someone, you get this feeling that you've never had before, you see yourself being with that person forever, you think about it, dream about it, talk about it, ect. you feel like you can do anything when you're with them, you feel like you're in another universe, your heart skips beats jsut thinking about them, and you think about them every second of the day; rguardless of anything you love them no matter what, and just how they are.|`|DiVF8CUAaa	When you look at someone and just think WOW. He/she is pretty cute. When you look at someone and just say I think I really like him/her.|`|YTj3ms09aa	have to agree with mark p.  You know when your attracted to someone you get that gut feeling and you feel an erection coming on.  Out of know where.|`|WMR8hVlfaa	For me, it was when I realized that I was far more concerned about his happiness than my own. When you like someone it's always very self-centered, you know? And there was one night when we were talking and I just realized that I was sick of it always being about me. I just wanted him to be happy and loved. That was when I knew I loved him. As far as being in love... later when we were dating (I knew I loved him before we got together - we were friends for 8 months beforehand), there was a time I was in need of money for something and he told me he'd empty his entire bank account for me if he could.     I very rarely let him give me money/buy me things, we pay dutch for pretty much everything because money is a VERY touchy issue with me and the idea of borrowing/taking someone else's money makes me anxious. But knowing that he felt that way, that he would offer all he had to me... I just knew he loved me and felt so much love for him in return.|`|M5hzHHvtaa	when you would do anything and everything just to see them smile...when you feel as though your in pain because the one you love is in pain...you smile when you think about them...someone you can see yourself with for the rest of your life...someone who you are willing to give up everything for...and your not with them for something stupid like money...genuine love is when you can accept their flaws and still love them...and you trust them more than anything in the whole world.|`|dyRdnsAXaa	A few things.  1. Are you able to trust them mentally and physically. Could you stand naked infront of them without being embarassed. And you could you say anything without wondering what they will think.  2.Do you love what you hate? Those annoying things about them. Can you deal with them?   3.After you say "I love you" there is no taking it back so you cant regret it. I know trust me. So you would need to think it through.  4.You put them before yourself.  5. To tell you the truth I haven't been in love. Been very close but after all me relationships those are the things ive gathered that i didnt have. And you will simply just know.    Hopefully that helps:)|`|OhaJV30Waa	genuine love for another person is when you put their happiness before your own.  You want them to be happy, healthy and safe, and nothing else matters but that. You get goose bumps when theyre around, you get butterflies when thinking about them you want to spend every moment with them and when you cant be there with them you constantly think about them, its all about them, them, them.... its truely a wonderful feeling to have and to share!!!   :-)|`|nv7Cofm5aa	You'll get different answers that are dependent on a person's preference. Quite frankly, regardless of age, how one defines love is entirely subjective. Some young women think 'love' is a classy definition of a fairy tale. Other young men think it's about lust. And some bored (but experienced writers) think they know a thing or two about love but are really looking for a quick way to make cash. However, the people reading their books and buying their 'love' books are being duped into believing their 'love voodoos'.     If you wan to find out what love is... then explore it on your own. You'll be surprised that there's no universal answer to what love really is.|`|vIiG3NILaa	When you start to cry just thinking of them not being in your life.  and when you can be so mad at them but then they say or do that one cute little thing and you laugh and you can't be mad anymore.    or when you just know that there is no better match for you in the whole world.  when you can have the worst day ever and then they just hold you in their arms and everything just melts away  when you can sleep next to them and not steal the covers  when you're sleeping next to them and they get up and you wake up almost instantly.  when the sky is bluer and the grass is greener when you're with them.|`|4w9gmvumaa	When you are sitting somewhere alone by yourself and you just smile, thinking about them.

AA12202402	Sounds like you turned the tables.   He said no serious relationship  At that point he was in control    You said cool friends without benefits  You are in control  The chase started for him to see if he could get benefits and now he is starting to be attracted to you. RUN when and if you two ever start a relationship he will end up bored and run for the next chase|`|aLgY4l3Naa	Well he was clear on what he wanted but now you are left CONFUSED! You need to talk to him and let him know that in the process of what was supposed to happen and what is happening you feel a little confused and you really need for him to clear the air!! That's not a lot to ask, you should not feel confused in the least bit when it comes to your relationship, but communicating this is the only way for the air to be cleared!! So stop wondering and start asking, if he is not good with it then you need to let him know he should not have caused you to be confused BOTTOM LINE!! Good luck to you and i hope all works out!!|`|b2zSN7wkaa	means that he just wanted to cuddle with you it's not all that bad if you two just had a good time then okay and if you cuddled then okay but just because you two are friends or whatever doesn't mean that he wants to be with you he probably just wants to hang out with you and have a good time. or maybe you can just ask him about it and tell him that you are confused about the mixed signals that he is giving you.|`|CINdqEhzaa	maybe he just feels really comfortable with you,
5DJcir9saa	Just because you cheated doesn't mean you don't love your husband.  You made a mistake and you obviously feel bad about it.  You've been unhappy for a while and your husband has been unreceptive to your feelings.  And although that doesn't make what you did right, it definitely makes it more understandable.  At this point, I think you need to have an adult conversation with your husband and tell him what you did.  Then you just need to go from there.  He might not be willing to work on it or this might just be a wake up call that he's been needing for awhile.  Bottom line...you have to tell him because it will come out eventually, especially since you cheated with someone you both know.  If your husband is willing to try and work it out you should meet with a couples counselor.  It will help immensely to have a neutral third party involved.|`|rcut6bhoaa	I doubt you will be able to live with your conscious about this.  I would seek counseling about it.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I think your being a little hard on yourself.  First off, you and your husband were having problems, he failed to recognize your pain and loneliness.  So he actually helped push you into the arms of another.  Telling him is an option, but if you feel that your no longer in love with him then you should just end the relationship now.  You really do deserve to be happy and I have found myself in your shoes and have walked that mile many times.  In the end, it will work out, but you will have to suffer some minor pain in your journey.  Good luck.|`|aXYiOskmaa	if you really want to save your marriage,don't tell him.it's not right to hurt him just to ease your conscious. however, if you don't love him, let him go.  another thing to consider is will the friend tell him to ease his own conscious?|`|IP2suWFTaa	why stay in a marriage if your not happy.Just think to yourself if this is the way you want to live the rest of your life.You need to be honest with him and tell him how un happy you are and what you did and why you did it.Its better to end the marriage while the child is young,if you let it go on for too much longer it will be harder for your child to accept that mommy and daddy aren't together anymore.but if you want to save your marriage and you and him are willing to work on your relationship,I suggest you two go to marriage counseling,so the two of you can have more of an understanding as to why couples do the things they do.|`|I814g6ZBaa	If you are 100% sure he will leave you, and you are 100% sorry for what you did -- KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT!!!    People can do the wrong thing.  They can be remorseful, have regret, and make the choice to NEVER DO THAT ACTION AGAIN.  Let this shame be yours and yours alone to carry; there's no need to put it on his back if you're going to be committed to making this marriage work -- get therapy if you need to, do whatever it takes -- take it to your grave.      The guy might tell; in that case what's going to happen isn't up to you -- but I don't think confession to the other person is always good for the soul.  Make your peace with God and live your life on the straight & narrow from now on.    Best to you, Honey.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	FINALLY someone with a conscious!!!!!!!! You my dear are not happy in your marriage. The first thing you need to do is to recognize that!!! And let yourself know that it's ok to feel this way. But as you well know now, it's not the right thing to cheat because of it. You need to let your husband know. This is going to be the tough part. If you've been telling your husband that things aren't right and he's been ignoring your plea, then he has some responsibility too in this. I'm not saying that it's HIS fault you cheated. IT IS NOT!!! YOU choose to handle the problem this way. When someone is telling you theres a problem and they ignore it, this is what happens. Things break down to where sometimes it can't be fixed!!!!!! You need to tell him now!!! I know it's not going to be easy. But for your sake you need to. Stop pretending your happy with this guy. YOUR NOT. I can tell by what you wrote. Then make arrangements afterwards to move on. And let you husband also move on. Hopefully he'll learn something out of this too. When someone is telling him theres a problem, then he'll do something about it!!!!!! GOOD LUCK!!! I really mean that. But stop pretending to be happy when your not. It's time to let him know. And don't listen to the jugemental as*hole PINKY??? Shes just an idiot!!!!!!!!!! Dumb as a ROCK?????|`|a0Vg5vMyaa	ummm.its ur fault..shudnt have done it|`|fHfVRcqbaa	I think you should just go ahead and put the both of you out of your misery by telling him.  It doesn't sound like much of a marriage anyway.|`|19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	Once your husband finds out that you spread your legs like a whore for his friend you may not have a choice in wether or not you stay married.  Oh yeah I suggest you come clean about what you did.  Trust me he will find out about you f-cking around on him.|`|MYbRICxqaa	You  answered your own question because deep down you know that what you did was wrong and you should tell your husband. You told everyone on Yahoo about your situation and I hope you tell your husband.|`|yMyJ9Y6Aaa	Okay cheating is wrong, you know that, but your husband kind of pushed you into it by not working on your marriage.  You were looking for love and attention and your husband refused to see a problem so you held out as long as you could.  But it was just a matter of time before you gave in.  And I think that you still love your husband but he makes it hard to do so.  And there are two opinions on this one, you either tell him and get counseling, or you keep this secret and the guilt and you live with it for his sake and the sake of your child.  Neither are easy, good luck.|`|AA11460234	Say the Act of Contrition twice and do the Stations of the Cross and ask for forgiveness.    Learn from your mistake.    Go child, and sin no more.    In Nomeni Patri Et Fili Spiritus Sancti.|`|MHwn4Tlzaa	First, don't say you don't know how this happened - you know how and why it happened.  You thought you could find happiness through sex and knowing someone wanted you made you feel better about yourself.    Second, don't tell your husband.  If you tell him, what good will it do him?  Will it make him feel better?  NO!  It would only be to relieve your feelings of guilt.  That is not his responsibility.  That guilt is yours to deal with.    Third, you have to decide if you want to save your marriage.  You must talk him into getting couple's counseling.  You loved him once and might still love him once you work through some issues.  You might also want to seek one on one counseling.  I think most people that cheat have low self esteem so a counselor might be able to help you with that.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	First of all, let me tell you I don't think cheating is ever right.  That said, I also want to tell you that you are not a bad person.    We all make mistakes in life. And no one can judge you, except God. He is the one who knows you and He knows what is going on inside your head and heart as well. We at YA can voice our personal opinions; but only you can decide what to do and how to do it.    I'd strongly suggest you consider going to therapy, and also scheduling an appointment with your pastor or priest. You seem like a nice and smart woman; and you need good advice.     Please seek counseling, because if you don't you might actually get sick from the stress and guilt you are feeling! I'm not kidding here! Guilt is a terrible burden!    Don't do anything you might regret. Consider keeping quiet for now, and see if you and your husband can agree on going to marital counseling as well. You need to decide IF you want to remain married or not; and that is not a decision you make overnight. Be honest with yourself and find out if you are willing to try to make things work out or not.     Avoid all contact with this other man...The last thing you need now is to have him call you and make things worse!    Good luck. You will be in my prayers.|`|hIwJxNVkaa	if you dont love him... then let it go... why be wit someone for the rest of your life if you dont love him.. you had problems with the marriage.. and he didnt want to help fix them.. you went somewhere else to seek help.. and you found it... its not entirly your fault..|`|LUWQ5S5jaa	Well i'll tell you anyways, You are F*ked up!    He was right there was no problem in the marriage, the problem was you.    And with his friend, that is soooo F*king low!    You need to tell him, so he can DIVORCE YOU!|`|yZxgC1e5aa	I read in a magazine once that if you cheat once...DON'T TELL.  If you can be honest with yourself and really know that it won't EVER happen again, then why risk your relationship?  But if you feel like you want to keep doing it...then you have to make a decision with what to do with your marriage and be honest to your husband about what you did.|`|AA11180444	Fix your marriage now or move on.  You both have issues.|`|mGU0h3O3aa	Cheating is bad, there is nothing to deny that.  BUT! If you aren't happy and your partner is unwilling to help fix that then of course you are going to look for something to make you happy! I don't think you can go without telling him. Maybe not telling him who.. but if he isn't willing to work on it then move on. Yeah it's gonna be hard but anymore it's more abnormal for two people to NOT get a divorce..   Stuff like that happens and it's not okay but it's not the end of the world either. It's your life, if he is in denial or fails to listen when you try to tell him something is wrong then how can you trust if your child grows up and you feel like he/she may need some help and he denies that?     Just go with your gut instinct.     Good luck :)|`|yjmOaG1kaa	ok you're in big trouble dear, first of all you slep with his and your friend, he will probably tell someone else and the truth always comes out, your husband will found out soon or later. so it's better if your tell him.   from my prespective i think that you don't love your husband anymore because when you love someone you don't betray them, your respect them. Remember trust+respect= Love.    Good luck!|`|Y8I3eGR1aa	You admit that you are not happy with him. Yes, it was not right for you to cheat on him. However, at the same time you tried to confide in him that you two needed to work on your marriage by letting him know you felt you two were growing apart. You need to leave the relationship if you know he isn't making you happy before you cheat again. Should you tell him? If you are gonna stay with him, yes you should. If not, just get yourself out of the situation and move on with your life. However, you may choose not to tell him and then his friend could be unable to keep this secret to himself.|`|n1s9jbnNaa	I don't know about the rest but you should tell him before it gets to him another way. It will be better to hear it from you than to hear it from someone else. It may end your marriage but it will teach you something and it will teach him something even if its not fair to him. He should have listened to you when you told him there was a problem but that doesn't give you the right to cheat either which it sounds like you understand. You simply need to talk with him and be ready to accept the worse. Throw out the option of counseling The last thing i will say in your defense is that if he says he is willing to work it out be sure he is being honest. Don't let him hold it over you for the rest of your life. To forgive means to move on and you both need to understand that...|`|xR5d6Zuwaa	Well, I think you should get a separation because if you are not happy...  No one else could make you happy. You should be able to walk away if you don't feel comfortable in a situation. and about cheating, it was the wrong thing to do, especially with a friend. Just walk away and end it friendly. because if you were unhappy before cheating, your conscious is now going to remind you constantly of what you did.|`|FAQldsUZaa	Well you obviously know it was morally wrong, yada yada yada... But it sounds as though it's eating you up. If your unhappy w/ your husband and you've tried numerous times to make the marraige work, but your husband didnt want to work on it, and as you said that doesnt excuse what you did, but the deed is done. Talk to your husband about it. Offer counsiling to make the marriage work. Talk to your husband's "friend" and find out where he stands... I know its really not his say, but see if he wants your husband to know what you did. All in all, I think you should tell your husband and see if he wants to work it out, or if you guys should split. Don't feel you have to stay because you have a small child together.     Good luck w/ this...|`|1L1AxWoXaa	Wow, what a mess. There are two sides to this. You have been unhappy for some time and your husband has been unwilling to help fix the marriage. In that end the failure of the marriage is not entirely your fault. The way you handled the situation is completely wrong (which you acknowledge).     First you stepped out of the marriage. Probably the better way to go was to tell him you were so unhappy you had been considering alternatives. To step out of the marriage with his friend is just about the worse way you could have done it. You have to make a decision. Do you want to continue this relationship? What you decide will chart your direction.     If you want to salvage this marriage then you need to come clean. If you wish to protect his relationship with his friend than don't tell him who you cheated with, just that you cheated. Knowing who will do nothing but hurt your husband more and that just isn't productive. If he is willing to forgive your for cheating (which does not happen overnight) than you really need to get into counseling.     If you are ready to be done with the relationship I would just tell him that you want a divorce. If you are not interested in going forward with the marriage I do not see much point in rubbing salt in the wound. Good luck to you. We all make mistakes but it is how we react to them that defines who we are.|`|F8jsGs3zaa	Wooow from what I am reading our culture is very conservative. Now adays averybody cheats. I have cheated and I think I ve been cheated on, but if you love someone thats not the most important point. I know some couples where the man treats the woman like **** and if she cheats she is a **** but if he does he is the best. NOW I would not tell him if I was you because we have a saying in spanish that goes IF YOU DIDN T SEE IT YOU ARE NOT GONNA FEEL IT meaning if he doesnt find out he ll be ok. Now if you think that telling him will make you feel better I dont think thats gonna happen cause if you didnt wanna do it. U should have thought about it before. Now I dont think it is right that you are asking people if you love or ddo not love your husband YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS THAT. Now if you really think you dont just leave him cause there is nothing worse (at least for me) to feel the indiference of  a|`|29hcn9JRaa	What ever you do, don't tell your husband, after all, their is no benefit in sharing this with him, they say the only reason people kiss and tell is to reap instant gratification and revenge, and don't tell me that you want to tell because you need to get this off your chest, if you want to clear your conscious then tell a friend, a co-worker a family member, but never tell your spouse, alerting your spouse to a one time mistake will cause your marriage major dysfunction, men don't take well to their women sleeping with others, not that women do, however men typically take it far worse, so get that idea out of your head, and I am guessing their will be others who will advise you to tell, but ask yourself this, if you tell what impact will it have on your future? what are the benefits for your husband? I mean really, what good will this do him? You made a mistake, one time, forget it, it's over, now it is time to simply work on what matters today, in the here and now, take your marriage one day at a time and try your best to work as a team with your husband. You are not a bad person, however you are a person who made a bad mistake, and I am betting you wont repeat it again? Good Luck, Penelope|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	Take some simple advise here.  Do NOT tell your husband.  Telling him will only make you feel, but and make him feel like crap.    Decide if you want to be married to your husband or not.    Whatever, your decision own it.  Commit to you decision and follow through.|`|KI2ait6Naa	Wow, what a situation!!!  I can see by what you have written, that this is tearing you apart inside.  You need to tell your husband, because "What is done in the dark, will be brought to the light."  You appear to be a person with a conscious, and coming clean would be the right thing to do. Not to throw it in his face, but to give your husband the respect and trust, that he deserves.  The dirty deed has already been done, now it's time to clean the mess.  You never know, your husband may see the error in not adhering to what you were trying to tell him and forgive you.  Or, your marriage may come to an end.  Either way, life has a way of teaching lessons to people, in its own way.    Overall, the situation is a mess, with you cheating with your guys' mutual friend.  You were beguiled by his kind words, probably the same words that your husband was saying. But the thrill of being with someone new, can be somewhat appealing; at that moment.  However, the results of the act can peel your skin back.  How can you look at your husband, day in and day out, knowing what you've done.  This kind of stress can mess your marriage up, altogether.  You had the balls to do the deed, have the balls to apologize for your discretion.|`|jUpGe66Yaa	Well turning to another man for comfort is wrong but how will you get him to admit there is a problem in the relationship if he keeps denying it.  Still not making you right, so don't feel better.  Marriage counseling does help a lot.  He can't accept that there is a problem in the marriage because then he has to face that he failed as a man.  It's a man thing.      You are really in a rut right now.  But you will eventually have to come clean to have closure and the guilt not sit in you.  You will lose his trust.  I suggest go to marriage counseling first then admit it there.|`|vwvYhWrLaa	I'm very sorry you have to deal with this issue that you've created, but you do.  First of all, get tested for stds - just to be on the safe side.  Then make a solemn promise with true conviction (to God, to yourself) to never do it again...and don't!  Then, seek good sound counseling; 1st for you, then for both you and your husband.  Commit yourself to your marriage with all of your heart, go to your book store and search books for ideas on what you can do for yourself, and how to ignite some excitement in your marriage. Do whatever it takes to redeem yourself, especially if this was a "one time only" affair.  Wait to talk to a counselor before divulging your mistake to your husband.  Just never do it again, no matter what the situation. Respect yourself, your husband and the vows you took.      I found out that my husband had cheated on me, and it's the worse feeling I've yet to experience.  I think if he'd only done it once, and not lost interest in me, I'd be able to forgive him.  But several times, several women, over a course of several years...and I hate him now.      Look inside yourself to remedy whatever caused this to happen.  Don't wait to right your wrong.  Never see that guy again!  Avoid him, and the places he might go to, at all costs!  Don't further jeopardize what you may be able to salvage (your marriage).    I truly wish you all the best, and hope things work out between you & your husband.
AA10986891	Maybe you need to be a little more aggressive with him, instead of asking him or demanding more sex. Just jump on top of him and take him for the ride of his life.    With the porn I would suggest you sit in his lap while you two watch and start seducing him while you watch. He might resist a little at first but eventually will go with the flow.    I think he is a little intimidated of how open minded you are sexually that scares him & he does not know how to react to that. So if you become a little more agressive and go directly to the point he will start to feel more comfortable.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	I think you need to realize that sex and masturbation are separate entities. Masturbation is a stress reliever and most people prefer to do it alone. Guys (and I'm sure women too) are set up for this alone time because they spent their entire adolescence trying to hide it from parents and siblings. Sometimes, religion even enters into the equation so for some, there is a tremendous guilt involved.     You said "i feel if he can't enjoy something with me that he shouldn't be doing it on his own" and this is the biggest part of your problem. This problem is more about you at this point than him. You are trying to control his every thought and move and how sexy is that? Do you think he's going to be attracted to you if you're nagging him about having sex and putting guilt on him about masturbation and his porn activities?     Your time would be better spent by leaving him alone, not nagging and working on your own self esteem for a while. Use some of that time to masturbate on your own as well. Learn who you are sexually, alone, and I promise your personal "sexy" will increase tenfold. He will not only notice that but will also notice that you're not on his back about masturbating or lack of sex.     Instead of nagging him, mention that you masturbated that day (I do it when my husband asks how my day was and I mention it with the laundry and errands) and he will see that being open about it is okay and not a big deal. You won't be able to get him off you, really. We teach others by example. When he sees that you don't think masturbation alone is a big deal, he might not let you in but he'll enjoy himself and relax more.     Marriage is about doing things to help your partner be happy. If you live by that example, eventually, he'll catch on and do the same for you. This is less about masturbation and sex drive than it is about your wanting to control him. He's obviously turned off by it so it's you that needs to change. When you do, you'll get him back.     I've been in your situation and learned what I've told you here. I think, no, I know, I was more insecure back then. I promise that being more secure in yourself allows your partner to enjoy you for who you are. Let him enjoy you, the sexy, confident you. Not the nagging, mothering wife you've become. (And I say that in the nicest tone possible, I was once where you are!) Try this and see if things don't change in a week or two....    Good luck :)|`|15e58edf21f33dd475298413b3cd6d8caa	give him bj in the morning & swallow! look  at his reaction...u have not described urself r  u  fat? too skinny?|`|MkBWfaJlaa	sounds like he has lost interest in you -   it appears you have tried and want to do the "fun" things - but he clearly doesn't want to include you -   appears you are headed in different directions -     my guess is that he isn't open to counseling - which is what you two need   if you want or need to talk just mail me|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Possibly his interest is waning, and he is bored.  That doesnt mean you are doing anything wrong, it sometimes just happens when you have been with someone for a while, just means you both need to spark things up in the bedroom.  You could try taking the initiative.    Wake up before he does in the morning and get to work on arousing him, then get on top and go for it.  Any husband who says no to that must be dead.    Be as attractive and sexy (in looks and attitude) as you can, spark his interest, show him that you want him and cant get enough.  Take control, keep things interesting, reap the benefits.    If you try everything you can think of, and nothing seems to work, then there may be a deeper issue, does he have a health problem?  Do you think counselling may help your marriage?    The porn issue - dont get me started there - I hate porn.  I dont like my guy watching it, and I have said that loud and clear, it makes me feel left out and not sexy enough for him, which he completely denies, but I have asked him to stop, and he has agreed.|`|veZLfnGFaa	Maybe you aren't doing anything wrong.  It could be that he likes the fantasy world with the porn and strip clubs.  You aren't in that fantasy, you are real.  Think about that ;)|`|kthrNyAdaa	the answer is simple but not popular.    allowing your husband to watch porn allows him to put his desires in another place.  when he looks at those women he does not, and i mean absolutely does not desire you.      if you dont beleive that, if he only wants to desire you then why does he need that.    by you watching it with you, you are allowing something to ruin the marriage.  porn does not help in the long run.  it ruins lives, it takes and never gives back.    as time goes on he is going to compare you to them and not find you as attractive trust me.  this is part of why your sex life is suffering horribly.  you arent the women he sees on tv, he is enamored with a fake reality of what sex is and what a relationship should be.    to fix this, stand up for what is right in your relationship.  no matter how much sex you have with him, unless you solve this, i promise you whether you want to hear this or not, your relationship will suffer.    i hope all is well|`|4o3jXz3Waa	I'm not going to make up some bogus response to your question.  I don't know the right answer for you on how to handle the situation, but what I can tell you is that IT'S NOT YOU.  These issues are not your fault.  You are ready and available for sexual encounters and willing to share things with your husband.  He is the one who isn't wanting to include you.  Continue to be attentive and available to him.  Maybe he will come around.  But most importantly remember....don't blame yourself for his issues.|`|Kr09aQJkaa	Has there been a period of time in your relationship were to turned him down often? If so, he hasn't moved out of the fear you'll reject him. Throw yourself at him.    Has your sex life taken a nose dive? Does he prefer porn over sex with you? If this is the case he needs some therapy to resolve his disconnection. In the mean time be very flirty, tease him often and tell him how sexy he is and how you miss him. Do this outside the bedroom and make it part of your normal day with him. There is nothing greater than knowing your woman has needs that only you can fulfill. Stroke his ego.    Next time you are washing dishes dip your boobs into the water and ask him if he'd like to see a wet t shirt contest. Wear a skirt w/ nothing underneath and flash him. Grab his package as he walks by. Give him the look from across the dinner table. He may be trying to take the easy way. No mess no fuss sex. Teach him that sex doesn't begin and end in the bedroom. Show him that this is way more fun.|`|ULUpOqplaa	Its very simple.  When a guy gets married part of his brain shuts down, MRI's show this.  part of that has to do with sex.  Not sex in general, but sex with you.  To him you are becoming invisible sexually.  Most people don't believe it, but its true.|`|zspVPoLZaa	umm disconect ur computer,     actually just have more sex with him,  and make it good  that'll make him stop watching porn  or jus watch it with him and prove to him that YOUR sex is better that watching it! lol good luck!!|`|p3UDlABeaa	whoops. that's one hell of a problem. maybe you need counseling.|`|mGU0h3O3aa	you can either get rid of all the porn, and put parental locks on everything.    or you can just give it up.  If he's not cheating then it's nothing to worry about. Sometimes guys just find it easier to do it themselves. Maybe they don't feel like having sex and just want to get off. Can't blame them, girls are like that too sometimes..|`|srf8MllRaa	YOU SHOULD WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND GIVE HIM A BJ...  SURPRISE HIM AND SWALLOW IT... THEN MAYBE HE'LL SEE THAT U CAN GET WILD..AND THAT ITS BETTER THAN PORN ALSO WHEN HE DOES WATCH PORN WATCH IT WITH HIM AND START PLAYING WITH YOUR SELF AND JUST HAVE SEX WITH HIM...THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY JUST HAVE MORE SEX..|`|Lb6Y7xlnaa	w0w.. OK, First of all, since you've already talked to him about it and nothing has changed you should start making moves on your own. One evening you should wear some cute lingerie and have some music playing... have some nice strawberries and chocolate or something he likes to eat and lure him in! If he is still acting all SILLY about sex with you then you guys might need counceling to get to the BOTTOM of this. There might be a B I G G E R issue at hand that your missing and you need to know whats going on.    Also, in your talk with him, have you expressed that this saddens you to feel like you can't please him? Or that you feel uncomfortable because he does the things he does?... Give him one last talk and see what happens|`|rcut6bhoaa	YOU wake HIM up in the morning !  Take some initiative here and work on it.|`|jjt2enntaa	First of all,  YOU are not doing anything wrong.  You have attempted to talk to him about what's going on, you have attempted to become involved, but he has refused.  You could spend from here to eternity trying to be what you think he wants, or trying to do what you think he wants,  and still be no further ahead.    Suggest counseling.  If he refuses to go you need to move on.  When you stay in a relationship like this, eventually you become resentful and bitter and start to believe it is your fault.|`|3wFt9fyZaa	Holy Crap!!  get off the guys back.  You are not the one person...do you want to wipe his *** when he dumps also??|`|IP2suWFTaa	Your not doing anything wrong and there is nothing wrong with you.Men just like to watch porn.When he sleeps with you its different than watching porn,he is making love to you and you two have an intimate connection.When he watches porn and strippers hes not emotionally attached to these women like he is to you.sometimes people just like to have their own privacy,but that doesn't mean that he doesn't love you.the only affair he is having on you is with himself and there is nothing wrong with that.Its not like he is cheating on you with the porn stars on tv or the strippers dancing on poles.If you accept and understand more why he does this and he accepts why it makes you upset,then the two of you will feel much better about your relationship.
utDlRWVwaa	Yea...i guess he's taking everything seriously and i feel its time to talk to him again and clear things up.....dont think he knew everything already...i mean you cant stop a person to start falling for you especially when you have some sort of relationship going...so its better that you talk cut n clear....good luck!!|`|IPS3hWweaa	Sounds like he's fallen for you and wants an exclusive sexual relationship at the very least. Remind him that you weren't looking for a serious relationship, and that he shouldn't be emotionally attached to you. If he really has grown to like you, he may be hurt, but unless you want him as a more serious partner you need to level with him.    The time may have come to break things off completely with this guy.|`|yMyJ9Y6Aaa	This is why hooking up is a bad idea, one of the people always gets serious.  Find someone else because this guy probably really likes you.|`|nAqu6pMtaa	He's scaring you right. For a girl like you, you need lots of space. So ask him to give you more space and if he still don't get it, ask him to get off your back and ignore him and find some other guy who would do what you want.|`|0Opi3SWKaa	he doesnt fully understand whats going on. how can u play him if yall not together? u need to let him know whats up. BE NICE!!!|`|3tHTZ2lKaa	well i think you should becareful with that foo..  hes trippin about you hangin out with guys..  freken leave him!
a35c4a3ab714036bfd3c31e133920f9caa	when you get to know the person better.  if they seem like someone you could see yourself with then ask.  don't put a time on limit on it, just see how things go.  most of the time you wont even have to ask, it will just happen... good luck|`|ZR34thBvaa	Pump her and dump her.|`|91ACjB5eaa	when it feels right.... just kidding :)  when you love her (or him)   when you want to say  you. hi mom this is my girlfriend ********  mom. oh! hi! nice to meet you ******* ive heard allot about you      when youre willing to do the above!    and you shouldn't just do it to do it, you better love em or it wont last|`|8A6A7UjLaa	between now and never|`|MoJM4CXkaa	ummm, it kinda depends on the situation, i would say after like 3ish dates, or maybe a couple weeks  but yeah, some people dont even like really "being in a relationship" cause that comes with a lot of pressure, im not saying that you should just do the friends with benefits thing, but it just depends really on what the other person wants|`|ilbMPWmzaa	after the first few phone conversations, and whenever you feel the person is feeling you enough to say YES. sooo, i would say 2 to 3 weeks tops, no longer than a month|`|tAmFjEflaa	a month maybe two. it really depends on how well you've got to know them over that time period.|`|nZ4cOSDZaa	maybe two weeks|`|FwLBIDpYaa	How much do love this person? You should surprise her! Take her to her favorite place and treat the situation like a marriage perposal. But as far as you question regard time is concerned, when you think you want her to be you girlfriend is the right time. Only you know when the time is right.|`|nXSYsQLCaa	i would say about a month or two it depends on how you feel but most of my bf's didn't ask me out until one to two months so that we could get to know eachother a little better because that we didn't want to rush in to things.     ask her how long someone waited and asked her out and see what she says about it.
sr7jX2wYaa	Just take some sexy lingerie, & maybe  some  sensual body lotions, and body paints , Those are real fun, & kind of erotic.

Unless you have already been there go to the bahamas|`|AqvEHHsTaa	why would you want to "top" his surprise?  Just be enjoying the attention, lavish some on him and be open to what he has planned.  Show your appreciation by being as spontaneous and excited as possible.|`|ajwIPeFXaa	I found one at Barnes and Noble. It is actually really neat. It comes with a silk scarf, a paddle, a feather, an erogenous zone chart, plus cards. The cards are in categories, and there is a spinner to tell you which card to pull. There are truth or dare cards, question cards, role playing cards, erogenous zone cards. I cant remember what it is called, but you get it at barnes and noble. It is totally worth it. Actually I took it on a weekend getaway for my boyfriends birthday, it was so great!!!
3J61iXGDaa	I think you should tell her that your guys friendship isn't working out anymore. It sounds like you guys have changed and it's not really working so you can be friends.
dlAVbLtDaa	becareful... I know you have feelings for her but she is on a different level now... you want to date... she is about to be a mom... you won't just be dating her but taking on a possible family.

So what if shes pregnant? It's not your child but if shes not with the baby's dad I'm sure she'll want a friend to help her out. Be there and support her because she'll like you for that and maybe ye could become a couple. It won't make you look bad, If anyone says anything just say that your not the father but you want to support her.|`|AA12196812	Somebody else's baby is a huge commitment, especially with both of you still in high school (and frankly, I would be concerned about an airhead who gets pregnant at 17 with some fleeting "ex bf"). If you really love the girl and think you can shoulder the responsibility of raising a child, well good luck. But it really is a big commitment there.    And no, it won't make you look bad at all unless you falsely pretend you're the jacka$$ who actually fathered the baby. Taking care of a woman with baby is a noble thing; fathering a baby with a high school kid is not.|`|nbN50XoFaa	All i can say is that its gonna be hard to raise another mans kid. if u rllllyyyyy think it can work out then go for it. but dnt only think of the present. think of the future.|`|A8OVGLdiaa	it wouldnt make u look bad at all i think...she will feel good 4 u i guess but if she is just 16, she should think about it a little more|`|7sxGW40qaa	Ok, the first thing, tell her to get an abortion, for all you pro - life people, see my "sources" spot.  She cannot ruin her life just because she screwed some guy and wound up with her little bundle of..... well not joy.  She might think you are being in sensitive, but tell her that a baby could ruin her life and it will cost millions on the long haul, especially with clothes and food.  How is she going to pay for that?  Ask her.  Most planned parenthood places will give her an almost-free abortion.    MOVING ON, liking her while she is preggers  is not going to kill your social standing.  It's not your fault.  It's hers.  Mostly..... Anyway, if you like her again, tell her how you feel, and how you will be there for her.  If you really love her, then you can solve this together.  But you should tell her that it is not your job to take care of that baby, and you will not spend a ton of money on another man's kid.  It's not right.  If she wants it then she can deal with it herself, but she shouldn't drag you down with her.       Good luck, that's all I can offer.|`|i1JVe24Oaa	Talk to the girl, not millions of strangers in YahooAnswers|`|SWAWw0Wdaa	Let her go...it is not ur child...she needs to work it out with the father of her child...all you can be is a good friend|`|D3iXIgeNaa	I think that is so wonderful of you. You have to realize now if you want her and she keeps her baby you have to think of terms that she comes as package, its not just her but her baby to. I don't think there is anything wrong with you wanting her you just have to decided if can handle her and the baby,|`|8qVkSA4jaa	Wow...so young.      If you are an adult about it and her ex is not romantically in the picture, then that is sweet of you to accept the fact that she is going to have a baby that is not yours. Are you willing to put up with the responsibilities of a baby? The no alone-time?    If yes, I dont think it looks bad at all. It is very admirable. But again, as long as you are mature about it.|`|AA11105856	I would say if u like her again let her know u are there for her she may like somebody there she has had a past with to help her cope with this. If it gets to the point she wants u bad it will just make it better for u|`|InZU5aaxaa	I'm pregnant but I'm married to the baby's father. All I want is for him to be there for me. So you just need to be there for her. Let her know you know it's not your kid and you are not trying to play "Daddy" right now. You are just there for her. Also try your best to have a good strong open relationship with her. Then later she will want to be with you and see you are the best thing for her.    Good luck and just be there for her.|`|HSOp9J4Iaa	Be smart dont make any promises, and just be.... do one good thing at one momnet, support her, but be youself|`|u0o0bCw5aa	There's two sides to this issue;     On one hand getting into a relationship with a girl who's got a kid on the way could tie you down and hurt your chances at a higher education and/or a better life. If you two were head over heals in love with each other and you were willing to adopt the kid that would be one thing, but if you just want her and the kid is baggage you think you're willing to put up with I'd say don't do it.     Why? Because it's not fair to you or the kid. What if you two end up only dating for all of a year... maybe two... (and I'm only giving you that much because you've already dated about that long). That's long enough for the kid to bond too you, especially at such a developing age... then if you two decide you're not in love after all, you'll either feel obligated to stay in the kids life, or feel like a jerk for abandoning him/her. Kids that young don't generally remember faces in the long run but at the time it would be extremely painful for the tot.    On the other hand, if you two really have something special, and she was off with other guys because her friends/sisters/mother/teachers/ECT advised her to "experience the world" before trying to settle down with you - not for lack of commitment - then that may be worth the stress and pain if it doesn't work.    But don't you dare let it keep you out of college if you intended to go!    As for how bad it would make you look - something I'd like to say to all high school kids is this: You'll only look as bad as you present yourself! People are going to talk trash, especially teenagers, and if you present yourself trashily (desperate and stupid) then they're right.... but if you present yourself as compassionate and loyal and willing to give this girl a chance because you care for her and want to support her - then people will recognize that. Sure, trash will still be talked, but it will be coming from close minded and ignorant people who don't matter. Really... they don't.    Ps. If she wants an abortion, be supportive. If you're willing to be really brave, offer to go with her so she's not alone. If you're pro-choice, you can share your views with her but it's her body and her embryo and ultimately her decision. She'll want you to respect that, and she'll appreciate your respect.|`|Gxz28zY1aa	Be her friend.  And the last thing that you want to do is fall for her.  You  might want to take a break from her for a while.|`|pX8qJzjIaa	I know how you feel, I dated a girl a while back and now she has a kid and she married the guy but its one of those "we have a kid we should get married" things.  I still have a little feelings for her and we flirt back and forth sometimes. I know it sucks, but having a kid changes people.

Why would you wanna be all sneaky? Why not just talk to your parents? It's probably best to just follow the rules that you have instead of risking the relationship you have with your parents.|`|NcsB9gUVaa	Well you dont want to get caught again so what you need to do first is find out how your parents caught you and how they knew you were gone. After that I would look into basement windows if you have one that is always an easy out. You want to use a door that is quiet and easy to get in and out of. Never use the front door thats way to obvious. if you use a side door or back door , take a piece of tape over the door latch just make sure no one can see the tape from the inside. That will allow you to open the door with little effort. best advice since you just got caught I would not sneek out for a week or so
Rbw3AGQUaa	why dont you build a huge polkadot tent in her room or something, and buy some cheap face masks and hair and face stuff and they give each other makeovers and they could have music and movies and lots of sweets and things aswell

Maybe he really is not ready. I think you should just leave your relationship the way it is. If you keep bringing it up he'll feel more pressured. When he's ready you'll still be ready so it'll be perfect. It's not going to be fun if your all excited about getting married now and your boyfriend isn't. Just stay the way ye are and make the most of it. Good Luck!|`|ssrLnvvWaa	maybe hes going to surprise you sometime soon|`|cIBqQ0QEaa	You need to determine how important marriage is to you. If it's really important, then you're going to have to set a time frame and leave if he hasn't done it because otherwise you'll be waiting all your life.     At this point, men understand that women like you will live with them and give them everything they would have if they were married, but without being married to you. It can't get better than that! You've created a situation mirroring a marriage (without the commitment) and now you want him to marry you?|`|m5uzV6uqaa	Have you pursued him about it??

It really depends on if you have sat down with him and told him how much marriage means to you, and why. Hopefully this was done in a non threatning way that he could probably relate to.     First you should calm down on the issue, wait it out a bit. Then when things are going along well, in a neutral place have a conversation (non judgemental) about why marriage is important to you. Ask him why he is so scared to marry you? If he doesn't give you a really honest down to the core answer, seriously, I would be out of there. Easier said then done I know. But sometimes people don't realize what they had until it's gone.|`|3jD57QwNaa	me and my girlfriend have been together for almost a year, and i know thats not really a long time but right from the begining we knew what our intentions are.

AA10832878	There are a few things you've left out, like does this Scorpio guy live "right" next door, or a few doors down? It's important, because I wouldn't want to be "you" if your hubby starts suspecting something, you know? As for the feelings you share, I'd wait until both of you are at least in the "process" of that divorce, before getting further involved. I don't know if this guy being a scorpio has anything to do with anything here, but I am married to a scorpio. Great guy, honest, caring, believes in God, loves children, and I won't discuss our sex life....eh heh....(mmm) Anyway, like I said, I'd start the divorce before getting involved, that way you KNOW neither of you are starting something on the rebound. And by waiting, if you "do" end up together, it will be that much sweeter, okay? Capricorn and Scorpio are supposed to be compatible.....but I'd still wait.|`|18a63a94d722f0ae9b0e54b97f2c22ecaa	HMMM WOW! REALLY SCORPIOS ARE VERY MYSTERIOUS CREATURES. THEY GIVE YOU A SENCE THAT THEY DONT LIKE YOU WHEN REALLY THEY DO!, YET THEY ARE ALL ABOUT SEX SO  BE CAREFUL|`|b9c9ee3f505b2f4cef42ec33d066ae32aa	ask him what's going down|`|mzkfSwLwaa	lolz im a scorpio =] but just talk to him be straight up
rnqgiRkWaa	lol no surprise here. thats what little bros are for.   i have a younger bro to that use to do the same things now we are older an he acts like my older bro, smart and protective. thats completely normal. play the same tricks. scare him to death. look on the internet goolgle it.. at night put suran rap underneath the 2nd seat covering the bowl of the toilet and when he goes pee it will splash backup at him and on his legs lol. i did this to my bro after he almost gave me a heart attack one night.    threaten if he does it again youl show everyone an embarresing video or picture   thats always how my older sister controlled me|`|BpNSm6sDaa	you could sneak in to his room and get the dummy and scare him back|`|Kk9f3MdRaa	1.) Bread flour (or like baking soda etc.) in the blow dryer if he uses it.    2.) Saran wrap the toilet so when he pees it will bounce back and hit him.    3.) Switch the salt and pepper (lame, but oh well)|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Pee into a jar. Then in the middle of the night pour it over his pants. He'll think he wet the bed, your parents will be furious. Don't ever tell anyone what you did either or YOU will be the one in trouble.
0udjgaoBaa	Hell yeah I moved out at 19 got my own place and never went back now im (28) im glad i moved out my mom was way too strict...We get along now but I love being on my own.|`|YFMaRxaWaa	when i moved out of my parents place it was only one level away. we still live in the same building with each other and it's awesome.|`|2ywzcoVqaa	I was sad to move out when I was 18,but I was starting a family of my own and had to move on. To this day (I'm 43) I still miss them if I don't get to see them very often. We were & are still best friends.|`|QieRAMLkaa	I moved out of my parents at 17  (to go to college)  my first roomate was awsome  but she moved back to canada  my second that I was placed with hated white people....unfortunately for her, im really as white as they come  my third who I chose   was sweet  but a total slob....like leaving bowls of nasty cereal milk all over the floor so I would step on them in the dark  my fourth (and final) roomie was introduced to me through mutual friends and I LOVED HER   she was opposite of me,  Im a slacker, shes a studier, Im a bar hopper, shes a homebody, I drink and smoke, she wanted to strangle me half the time because I smell like smoke.   But we both had a similar scense of humor, liked talking about our relationships, love animals.   We found happy mediums where we couldn't agree.  She was reasonable and level headed and we respected eachothers possessions and space.   Since it was a same room situation we worked out a system to signal eachother when it wasn't a good time to enter the room  (the sex scrunchie on the door handle lol)        living with people means  your gonna fight sometimes and want to kill eachother   but if you approch your differences with mutual respect then you will have a very happy co-existance with eachother
TShsb3EXaa	Oh, you're a girl - then that changes everything - yeah, it's good.  Secondly, so people think you look young for your age take it as a compliment seeing as when your 40 you'll be wishing for people to tell you that.|`|91916cdfcacbfc10a3cb8d35b35bb07daa	i guess it is|`|Gitb3KVDaa	be greatful, they could have said you were a *****.

I slept with about thirty men and don't give a flying rat's bum.  I used protection every time and my dear husband has slept with four women.
e98RKB35aa	Why would you want to do something like that to your partner. A little joking is good fun but making them jealous is just wrong.|`|AA11307468	You cannot make someone feel jealous or any other feeling, unless that person gives you that power.|`|jJwuMTSqaa	Depends on the situation. I think everyone is guilty of this. I believe it is not a very good tactic though.|`|SwvCb2Bfaa	No, sometimes a fire under their rear will spice up the relationship and stop making them take you for granted.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Yes. You should not be playing games. You should not want to make her feel bad for any reason.|`|7ewzmiNEaa	No value in it. Childish|`|v0G9s9ktaa	Yes, it is wrong. Why would you want to intentionally make the person that you claim to love feel bad?|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	I think not only is it wrong, it's a waste of time.  It means someone is insecure.
e1MVMR2Faa	Definetly.    This girl I started talking to at the Marines Recruiting station is the total opposite from me, but we're like sisters.(We've only been friends since Dec. 5)    She's VERY outgoing, wears her heart on her sleeve, and just has a very 'hippy' like personality.    Me on the other hand, I'm really shy. I keep a lot of things to myself, and only speak to people when they speak to me.    When we both hang out, it's like we've known each other since we were kids.    Maybe its just that bond you get with people when you join the military, or truly opposites attracting|`|EvDoLydgaa	In people I dont think so|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	Take it from me, if you feel an attraction for someone who is your opposite, fight it. I've been with a couple of opposites and it just ends up being miserable after a while.  Now, my fiance and I are very similar. Which means we can always find something we agree on. For example-we both love baseball and football. There's never an argument what to watch during the season, because baseball or football always wins. Also, we only watch one regular show together-"Lost". Otherwise it's MLB Network, ESPN or an action or sci-fi movie. Life is so much easier when you are with someone you are compatible with.   So you are right on, when you are different-arguments are bound to happen. Which will make you miserable.|`|a796jDdlaa	Some say opposites attract...but some have a hard time getting along...|`|DpvXEd3Naa	opposites only attract in magnets, not people.  U should be with someone who identifies with you, not opposes u|`|bELCxTXfaa	Look, if you feel comfortable with that person, the difference of opinion has no significance. However, if the vibe is not good, meaning, nothing is similar between you and him, just don't be friends with him. If the chances of friendship are slim now, odds are there won't be any in future. Choose your friends wisely, and no one can force you to do that. Hope I helped.|`|hhL1G3Ofaa	I believe as far as friendships go, you need to have similar personalities to work, but as far as a relationship, opposites do attract to each other.|`|PV8TqGGgaa	i have friends that r totally opposite personalities than me.  try it see what happens!!|`|BpNSm6sDaa	sometimes because then you try new things but sometimes its bad because you fight about what you want to do
b6f151d22968bb6b096edc46ea223f85aa	I am so sorry for your loss. It is a tragic thing that happened and no answer will ever be good enough. You might have to think of it differently. I do believe you should seek counseling through a professional and talk about it. I hope someday you will accept the loss and be able to get on with life. I hope your pain eases soon. so sorry.....  :(|`|sPxmH9yQaa	I am willing to help. What is your email? We'll talk. If you don't like how it goes just tell me and I'll leave you alone. I completely understand your pain though. I just lost someone very dear to me in a car accident and I keep thinking I'll see him around the corner when I pass, but he's never there. I know you don't want to hear about my pain, but I wanted you to know that I'm getting through it and maybe we can help each other.|`|o0GPDE4Maa	all you can do is remember him, and what he taught you. I would say, that hes in a better place. but your not religious. Just do what he would have done in life, and make sure that you don't do anything that would make you feel bad, like you let him down.|`|DDcs0R1maa	wow well the fact that you don't believe in god is a big thing but then again its your decision. It really must be hard to lose someone like your dad and even though you may want him to come back hes not going to. You as a person need to get up and try to understand that hes not coming back and the best thing to do is get off your *** and find something to keep you motivated enough to not think about the fact that he is gone or else it will hurt even more. try to find things that you loved to do, and do them don't ever let your self go . know that he will always be in your memeorys and in your heart. :)  im sorry for your lost....|`|1L6h4YXiaa	i've lost my best friend as well, but it's because i couldn't handle some things, so in some ways his memory has been erased and sometimes he's not a 'beautiful' person the way i used to remember him (and i'm not as well). to help you cope, remember he'll always be there whenever you want to remember him.  i also lost my father when i was a kid (i'm 27 now). and i'm just realizing that things happens and i can't het him back (and i couldn't all this years).    i hope we get over this 'loss'. my friend's still alive but in a way 'we're not'. i send you a shoulder were you can cry (i'd recommend cry until you can't cry anymore). R.I.P. your dad.|`|01yBLHvWaa	im not going to say maybe there was a reason for this because i dont beleive this was.    but the way your going about this is completley normal especially at your age.    i personally would recommend a psych. because i am studying to be one & even though they seem like they wont help, in most cases they do. they will give you exercises to do to help you cope & they will talk to you about this when it feels like no one else understands.    honestly theres not much you can do because something like this just gets better in time. & im sorry for your father. truly am. i lost my mother when i was about 13 i didnt stop being miserable and crying every day till i was about 15 & there are still days i cant help but cry & im 22 now.     sorry if this wasnt much help. hope in time your heart mends, even a little bit.|`|6rvzeOsqaa	first of all, understand that it's ok to feel very depressed at this point.  i know it's not pleasant at all, but it is natural.  grief and mourning is a process - often a very slow process.  it's important that you let yourself grieve, otherwise the emotions will bottle up and can manifest themselves later in negative ways.    since your loss is recent, i'm afraid there is nothing you can do right now to make the pain go away completely.  you distract yourself for moments at a time, but that ache will be there for a while.    just try to focus on all the happy memories you have of him, and try to find comfort in the thought that part of him still lives on in you - genetically, emotionally.  he may be physically gone, but tangible evidence of his existence are all around you, and in you.  you will throughout your life carry him with you, so-to-speak.    the loss will never go away, but as time passes the pain will fade.  it will.  but the love will continue to grow - the love he had for you, for others.  his love remains alive in you.    those are just my thoughts.  i hope they are of use to you.      be well|`|aJjV5b95aa	I am very sorry for your loss!, but you need to move on with your life. I know that it is easier said that done. Look at it this way would you dad want you to be so upset that you don't want to get out of bed, probably not he would want you to move on and do things with your life. Take things one day at a time try to start doing the things that you used to do as hard as they may be.|`|tao83sDxaa	your going to hate what i have to say, but we all learn to deal with it. you have every right to hurt inside. your dad will always be with you. you will learn to live with the hure you feel, in time it may become less, but it will always be with you. you get up in the morning, because you have to. you have to keep going. it won't be easy but you can do it. take care|`|veZLfnGFaa	Oh, I know you are going through a hard time right now.  Death is hard, but it is always harder when it's unexpected.  You have to grieve in your own way and remember that he loved you and wouldn't want you to be so depressed.  Think  happy memories of him - this is what keeps him alive.  :)|`|ksqPjgEUaa	i'm very sorry for your loss.Just try to remember the good. The last time you hugged him, your last conversation. The last time you laughed together. He's still with you. Looking over you.     I lost my father a few years ago. There's a long story with that... but that's not necessary to share. I found it hard to deal with. He had a collection of music. ~ Billy Holiday... I never pictured him the type to like her music, but apparently he did. I played the CD's. Took long hot baths & cried my eyes out for a couple weeks. ~ One night, I found myself sitting alone in my living room. I felt him there. So, I had this imaginary conversation with him about what I was feeling. ~ The next day, I thought - that was crazy... but, it helped. I stopped crying.   The death of a loved one will stay with you. Make you more grateful for those around you that love you dearly. Just cherish every moment & enjoy your life. You're father would've wanted you to be happy & to move on. Never forgetting, but not consumed.   I wish you the best in healing.|`|BPrMusoLaa	PRAY FOR YOURSELF, YOUR DAD, AND CELEBRATE HIS LIFE. I KNOW HOW U FEEL, NOTHING CAN BRING UR DAD BACK BUT I WANNA SAY TO YOU BE STRONG. CRY IF U WANNA CRY. MOST PEOPLE STOP THEIRSELVES FROM GREIVING BUT DONT! CRY AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO NOBODY CAN TELL U WHEN ITS OVER ONLY U! LIVE YOUR LIFE THE WAY UR DAD WOULD WANT YOU TO BECAUSE BABY HE IS WATCHING. JUST MAKE HIM PROUD AND YOU WILL FIND THAT SOMETHING IN YOURSELF THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO BLESS URSELF AND BE THE PRODUCTIVE AND HAPPY PERSON YOUR DAD WOULD HAVE WANTED. CLOSE UR EYES AND SCREAM WHENEVER U WANT WHERE EVER U WANT. LET UR HEART BLEED FOR UR DAD AND ITS GONNA BE OKAY! I WILL BE PRAYING FOR YOU AS WELL......I KNOW U ARE NOT RELIGEOUS! U DONT HAVE TO PRAY TO GOD IF THATS NOT WHAT U BELIEVE IN SWEETY...PRAY 2 UR DAD CAUSE LIKE I SAID HE IS WATCHING U......|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	I am very sorry to hear of you loss.I know you are mourning and missing him,But think about what Dad would want from you,Would he want you to be miserable or to keep living your life,He is always with you,He is in your heart.Grab a Photo album and take a glance at Dad and remember what he wanted for your Future.Again I am very sorry for your loss and in time the pain will ease.
jpMi2D5Jaa	At the time I never thought I would marry him.  We were just in middle school when we starting "dating" if you call it that, lol.  Anyway time went by and we became high school sweethearts and then husband and wife!|`|L38M9lrLaa	yes..i meet him in a starbucks parking lot..turns out he was a friend of one of my friends..i went into red robin with daniel and he was at the table with a bunch of other people then we all went to the beach and me and matt connected.. the rest is history|`|vFCva8R5aa	As far as looks go, yes    As far as personality, he is everything I ever hoped for in a husband.|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	Oh, yes.    I was into smart, hot, tall, fit guys.  I married a geek who had a leftover from the Air Force hair cut, wore funky clothes, very buttoned up.    We got married nearly three years ago.  He is the love of my life.|`|09fb14d66d014c3ec713bb71c64b144daa	Yes. She is my favorite cousin.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Yes my first wife. I was on a trip to Las Vegas I got drunk . Then I ended up marrying some woman I was drinking with. We got married by an Elvis inpersonater. It lasted 5 years before the divorce. I quit drinking. She did not.|`|8X4jlJQeaa	Yeap, (my husband wasnt at all my type) but its been 10 years and two children later and its the best decision Ive ever made.
AA10137828	It sounds as if you are not ready.    Not sure if he is but you are definitely not. Try and stay engaged while separated. If you can do that, marriage may work, but if you can't do that there is no way you would have a happy marriage.    It is much easier to end an engagement than a marriage.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I was in a long distance relationship too.  It is very hard, and I can't relate to not seeing eachother for 6 months at a time, but it can be done!  Just keep yourself busy and the time will go by a little faster.  :)  Good luck.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	well you have to decide if your physical needs outweigh your desire to be with this guy forever.  I mean, once you're married, even if it's ten years from now, you got your whole life to sex him right?  either you can wait or you can't.  but if you can't, don't cheat on him or leave him hanging, be up front and tell him you want to see other people and once you're both done with your tours try to get back together if neither of you found anyone else in the meantime.|`|f547b0547924b21590b8ffb102004fdeaa	Since you have so little time together it sounds like marriage plans will have to wait. Certainly the relationship can work in the future, but if you've hardly spent any prolonged time together how do you know your marriage will work in the long run? Good luck.|`|13bf9874413959dbd425a6a84c9b9159aa	wait  time will tell|`|NUXLamcWaa	If you really want to be with him, then you should never do anything that you aren't willing to tell him about.  The moment you do you will be living a secret life, and this will come between you.  It is very possible for this relationship to work, but it will take a lot of love and trust.  Leading a secret life will not build trust.      That being said, I think you need to take your current military commitments into consideration.  If you really are actually thinking of infidelity now, imagine what it will be like when you can't see him at all.  Now at least you see him a few hours a week.      If you don't think you can live up to the commitment. Then maybe you need to have a talk with him.  Maybe you can adopt the "What happens if Vegas stays in Vegas" philosophy for while you are apart.      If he is not for that, then maybe you should go your separate ways.  Maybe you can set a date in the future when these obligations are met for you to try to reunite and start dating again.  At that time you both will be bringing additional experiences back with you that will either make you closer.  Or you both will just realize that it was not meant to be.      Whatever you decide.  Communication should be the first step.
siDcjgJCaa	My husband does it ALL THE TIME.. "babe will call (such and such), I am too busy." , "I dont have time" , " you are better at it than I am"     I call his mom, his grandparents, our friends, all the utilities or house hold issues EVERYONE!     I dont know how to get him to take care of his own crap... i have failed in that respect. I usually just do it because I hate waiting until the last min. to do things, so i get frustrated and just make the call.....     I hate it too.. I know how you feel...|`|AdeD0xMuaa	I had to argue with him just to call and order pizza last night. It was ridiculous. I would have called myself but I'm sick of using my card just because he "doesn't like to call people."|`|kQEnJpOvaa	Ha! My husband is the same. I just refuse to do it, especially when it comes to calling his mom. He will get over it, just stick to your guns!|`|AA11097612	I love it when someone calls someone else names for not doing something they are not willing to do themselves.  Your husband is a grown man.  He needs to act like a grown man and stop hiding behind you.  For your own sanity and the sake of your marriage you need to set barriers as to what you will and will not take responsibility for.  What lies outside of those barriers are not those things that you will not take on because you have enough to deal with.  You can enforce these barriers calmly and without yelling or losing your temper.  Simply say, 'No."  If he badgers you look him strait in the eye and say, "You are a grown man and you can do this if it is important enough to you.  But whether you do or do not do this I am not going to even think about it because I have my own stuff to work on."  Then drop it and go do what you need to do.    This will probably make your husband very angry and frustrated in the beginning  but in the end it will be much healthier for the both of you.    Good luck.|`|rRO3x9hZaa	lol, my sister does this to me all of the time...I guess the best thing to do is to refuse to make the call for him. If he really wants to get whatever it is said, he'll do it himself.|`|hpgXPKIbaa	Well... I don't like calling people, so I let my wife handle most phone-calling things.  But I don't MAKE her call people for me.  But that's mostly because it's impossible to MAKE her do anything.  Stick up for yourself.  Tell him you don't mind making calls for things that involve both of you, but things that are his business -- for example, his ex -- he needs to take care of that.|`|5ViTUTyZaa	Had the same issue...I finally started saying no w/ the same reason every time 'you have to learn how to do this' and 'I have so much of my own stuff to do, although this might just be one or three phone calls for you, add it to the list of 3 I have to make for myself today and 2 I have to make for our son today, it is constant'.  He was very upset but FINALLY got it.  Just keep saying no and he will be mad and throw a fit but once he realizes it is not that bad, he will get over it.|`|O46f8wl3aa	Well, ya'll need to come to an agreeement of some sort because revisiting the same issue over and over again will cause un-do stress on a marriage. There is no need for that kind of petty stress. If you're not doing to do it make that clear, but do not offer to do it in a moment of 'helpfulness' you might feel later on.    On a side note.... This is a petty fight ya'll are having. This is the kind of crap that causes marriages to fall apart. Ya'll honestly need to get your crap together and stop fighting over stupid crap. Seriously, boil that down and ya'll are arguing over a phone call?!?! Really?    On another side note, he should honestly be making the calls himself.|`|HLIv7TLHaa	I applaud your decision not to "coddle" him.   Do yourself (and him for that matter) a favor...stick to your guns and don't make any more calls for him.    Be forwarned:   the road via this new behavior may at first be ruff and rocky but hang in there...in the end you'll both be the better for it.|`|0WstfAmzaa	Wow, I'm glad my husband is a little more understanding.  I'm quite phone-phobic so usually he'll make the calls for me and I'll do the legwork, looking up information, going in to places, etc..  I don't know what it is about the phone, but I just hate it so much..    He doesn't make all my calls and sometimes we'll have a little bit of a 'discussion' about it, but he's understanding that I'm not doing it on purpose.  And I'm slowly getting better..  I used to be so bad that I wouldn't even make calls to family members.. Now I can call most of my family members without feeling stressed..    But we are a team and even if he's the one making the call, he knows that I put the effort in all the research.. :)      And I will make all the calls that pertain to me personally - i.e. appointments, etc, because I don't think it's fair that he has to make calls like that for me.  But if it's something where he knows all the details as well as I do, then he'll usually do it.|`|vm1Fj2AVaa	I would do it for my husband. I am a little shy too, but he is shyer. You have to take your man for who he is...faults and all...for better or for worse. Oh yah....all men like to be coddled!|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Well I have yet to receive a phone call from either of you...|`|snUDfcfgaa	No.  I'm usually the one trying to get someone to make calls for me.|`|ZaMzRSrraa	yes sometimes but simple things..repairman,plumber....not to your extent...    YOU ARE NOT GETTING DOPED    YOU CHOOSE TO DO THIS    STOP IT STOP IT !!|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	He has a phone-phobia he isn't the only one, my guy hated using the phone and so does one of his daughters.   You are supposed to be supportive not meanspirited towards him.  Marriage is 2 people helping one another, your strengths might be his weakness and vice versa.   You could have a little understanding.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	He used to. I stopped doing it and he found out he was more capable of dealing with things than he thought. Now it's not an issue at all. I think some guys are less social (or lazy) when it comes to dealing with other people. If you let him get away with it, he'll keep doing it. Make him take charge of something and he'll see how easy it is!|`|m8UEGUaGaa	My SO does this to me too. I don't seem to mind b/c he does so much for me. If I get held up at work he will run some of my errands to make sure I can get home in time to cook dinner for us. LOL  At this point I don't feel taken advantage of so I'm fine with helping him because he loves to help me to. Our relationship is give and take and helping each other out is an extension of our love.|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	LOL I just hung up the phone about the home owner's insurance and didn't have half the information I needed about what I was even calling about.  He just tells me to call someone but I have no idea why I'm calling them or what I'm calling for.  But he hates the phone and talking to people.  I don't.  So I get roped into making all these calls.  I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one.  It'd be nice to know what I was calling about for once though!|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	Oh Yes for yrs I made all this calls for him.He would call me on his cell phone and ask me to make calls for him about parts or to his family.But Over the Past 2 yrs I have almostt broke him of this Badhabitt and he does it him self.|`|3PNyReZnaa	Yes!! My husband doesn't make any phone calls. He says he hates talking on the phone. But he sure does call me all the time!!!!!!|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	LOL my hubby does this to but i tell him he is a big boy and to cal himself.
H7LwCrZ2aa	Grab his hand ,Look him straight in the eye and tell him what you feel . Touching someone gets their full attention. And feels nice for both of you.Just talk like you normally do. It is the same, with more personal information. No fear, you know him. The age might be a  problem for a real romance though. But you want to tell him, go ahead as it's important to you.|`|LgOOYyXIaa	this is so adorable  i would come str8 from the heart  explain to him how you feel!  tell him everything, just be really honest, and make sure that u talk to him in person, and make eye contact with him too!  i hope it helps!  xoxo|`|BqgXCxwVaa	Ok....just tell him the truth and exactly what you feel. Also try " i want to be more than a friend for you'
BPtnDLu3aa	Eh, sadly...you're not the only one. Cases like this appear everywhere and at least you're willing to admit it. Honestly, the best thing to do is control it and not confront her about it. I know that sucks but eventually, you'll find someone else that isn't related to you that you can love. Once that happens, all you will feel towards your sister is sibling love. That is, by our society and by our biology, the right thing to do. There are lots of cases like yours online so maybe you can look them up? :) Who knows? Maybe you're just young and confused right now and it isn't anything as serious as you might think it is. When I was young, I wanted to marry my mother even though I'm a girl. o_O I just didn't have a good grasp on things. lol I'm straight...v_V; don't worry. Honestly..ur situation is more common than you think. Just try to ride it out. Oh and I've had a crush on a male cousin before when I was eight...ew. v_V|`|5vIaimUzaa	just think of how disgusting it would be if you were together and that your children might be handicaped and that will make those feelings go away!|`|ED9HMQIvaa	Move out of Texas...|`|IEQqdYO2aa	Ella- hahaha wow just screw her and have a retarded kid then the fellings will go away   Rose- yes ellas right *nods head*  your a sick freak   :]|`|4hkM3HXyaa	Anytime those thoughts pop up you should push them right back out. If you have problems doing that, you should definitely think about seeing a counselor to talk to.   Meeting other girls would probably help too.|`|emHkDQmaaa	wow! this is awkward try to avoid wanting to be in da pool with her dnt fall for your sister if you keep on doin this its gona end up to you wanting to do thing because of your curiosity|`|2jVLq2dnaa	Hang out with other girls...|`|QRpCJVGXaa	that's probably just lust. go find hotter girls out there!|`|a6j0cwgqaa	Seek help!

SHE'S YOUR SISTER AND THERE IS NO WAY THAT WOULD EVER WORK! DO YOU THINK SHE COULD EVER HAVE FEELINGS BACK????? ITS WAY TOO WRONG!!! Find another girl and I MEAN FAST!!!|`|uwoFso71aa	Ummm. Thats a hard one. Talk to a counsler or something to get those feelings to go away.|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	She's your SISTER.  You need to get out more and be around other girls!|`|14c85dc8b02a634af90573028da45e82aa	woah woah woah!..this could be serious!..get out and see other girls something is really wrong there you shouldnt be having feelings for your sister...if nothing helps..go see a counselor..|`|Dm3AHmG5aa	Honestly, I wouldn't dwell on it too much. The more you think about it the deeper the feelings are going to get. 1st remember she is your sis. 2nd Try to hang out with other chics. 3rd Know that there is nothing wrong with you, that your human and you have feelings. 4th. Don't try to avoid your sis, try not to think about it and eventually some one will take your mind elsewhere.|`|etGhDgoSaa	Uh, oh.  In our society in the U.S.A. this is:    Not socially acceptable.    Not moral.    Not ethical.    Not right.    Bad.    Wrong.    Unacceptable.    Perverted.    AND ABOVE ALL LAZY!    Find someone outside your immediate gene pool.    Men can be attracted to any female.    Not uncommon or bizarre.    But use some discrimination, please.    Never allow yourself to even entertain the thought of a intimate encounter with someone in your immediate family.    That's my advice.|`|XkH0H99haa	Start looking at other girls|`|ZUdDbnnkaa	YOU SHOULD DEF TAP THAT...

This is my dress its going to have the eggplant trim. Saw this dress in a magazine and fell in love tried it on and fell in love all over again. It was also the first dress i tried on.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I love when brides go a different way!!  I think it's awesome...  I'm just not daring enough to go another way, and love my white gown.    But, I loves seeing non-traditional brides' ideas...  It's so much more fun!!    Remember, it's about the marriage.. Not the wedding.  I think it's a great idea!!|`|nqINitkmaa	I'm doing Ivory. But maybe have a seamstress add some white detail, like white trimming or something would look nice. Its really up to you and I agree keeping a non tradition is kind of cute, but are you going to be upset down the road if you don't have the traditional white dress pictures? They may not even look like wedding pictures. Its your wedding do what you want and what you feel comfortable in!|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	i happened to wear white to my first one, only because the dress i happened to find happened to be white (it wasn't a wedding dress).  my 2nd one i wore green for the same reason (which i spent $12 on btw)    the tradition of wearing white is not very old, and by no means does a bride (even a virgin) 'have' to wear white.  if you feel good in that lilac gown and that's what you want to wear, by all means, do it!  and if you find a white one in the store that you love, wear that.  in my opinion, it's all about feeling very special and beautiful on your very special day, so go with what makes you feel that way.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	I have never had any intentions of wearing a white dress and I can't imagine why I would regret it. I don't own anything white or ivory because they look terrible on me. Not to mention, white as a wedding color really isn't that old that people should be getting upset if someone doesn't want to wear it. It also does not signify purity or virginity no matter who tells you otherwise. If you brush up on the history of weddings, colored dresses are alot more traditional since those were worn throughout history long before white ever came along.|`|KglW7g96aa	i like the lilac dress idea. it's YOU, and that's what matters.   the only reason white wedding dresses ever became a "tradition" is because queen victoria wore white at her wedding, and people have been doing it ever since.   i am personally wearing a champagne gown. i never saw any reason to not wear what i really wanted.     go for it if it's what you really want, i think it would be gorgeous!    congratulations.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	I'm not wearing a white dress. I tried on white and ivory dresses at a bridal shop and each one made me look like a corpse. I'm very pale so too much white and I look like a ghost.  I'm wearing a pale peachy pink dress. its almost like ivory but it has just enough pigment in it so I don't look like the bride of Dracula.  Best thing about the dress is it's free. I got it as a hand me down through one of my aunts.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	Your wedding your choice. If you love the dress, you should wear it.|`|gwindStOaa	I think you should go with the lilac ball gown. It would be so pretty! (and you'll be saving lots of money on a dress you'll wear once!)|`|2o3BHgCCaa	If you love the lilac dress better than any other then you should wear it.    Personally I will be wearing white (and pure white too) because I found the perfect dress for me and that colour suited me best.    One thing to consider though is that you may have the opportunity to wear the lilac dress again to a ball or whatever, but you will never again get the chance to wear a white wedding dress. People tend to look at you odd if you wear a wedding dress on an occassion that isnt a wedding.|`|gRZT4pnUaa	They say you should wear what makes you feel beautiful on your wedding day. I think is doest matter what color it is as long as you like it. I think the carrying on the tradition of non traditional dresses is awesome. You should go for it. After all it's your wedding, do what pleases you.|`|pMsMx817aa	you should wear it :)  im skipping the white dress  my dress is black with an electric blue ribbon around the waist    good luck and congrats :)  ella|`|DqetlSB6aa	Ive thought about it since i want a beach wedding one day I always said Id something similar to this    http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/s...    and have a seamstress use the shaw material and make a matching short veil or a fabric flower.|`|fUBWB88laa	My gown is silver. I never wanted white OR ivory. I don't like that tradition and I'm sick of seeing the same white/ivory dress that are poofy and pick up style. If you feel amazing in that dress, wear it! It's not going to kill anyone or give you bad luck b/c you didn't wear white...wear what you feel best in!|`|E7LQp6VRaa	The advice when I got engaged was... it is your wedding, do it the way you want it, not everyone else...  and that is how I have been planning our wedding...      If that is the dress you want to wear, then go for it!|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	I think your lilac dress will be lovely. It seems like the dress really makes you feel good, which is the point. If you want to wear lilac, I don't see why you shouldn't. There are a lot of gowns out there that are in different colors. Go for it!    Good luck!|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	It doesnt matter what you wear as long as you are happy. I have been to a couple of weddings where thebride wore, red, blue, even purple. If it makes you happy, go for it. Just keep in mind that you only do this once, and you cant change your mind later. I saw one wedding once where the bride wore red and the bridesmaids were all in white, pretty cool.|`|E2X6B1Iaaa	Wear what you like! I think it is awesome to stray from "tradition." My dress is a 1940s inspired cocktail dress that i found at a consignment store for 40 bucks. it is short, halter styled and not white!     Have fun and congrats!|`|083e9846706988570511a5b3e605f74aaa	it's your wedding so you can do whatever you want. the only reason y the dress is white is because in the old days women got married when they were still virgins so wearing white usually meant u were pure. now adays no one cares what color ur wearing just as long as you feel beautiful then thats all that matters

If your father is violent, you and your mother may need to move. Men like that rarely abide by a restraining order. Your father needs to man up and pay support. At 15, you need to make sure that this money goes towards YOU, and not towards keeping your mother from having to get a job.    Tell your father that if he is going to get angry about having to be a responsible father, that you hope he gets therapy for his anger since you will not be able to have a relationship with him if he acts like a loose cannon all the time.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	'supporting yourself' does not end with getting your own clothes, iPhone, iPod, etc.   your mom is going to need the support money for bigger place with your own bedroom, utilities that go with bigger place,  food, etc etc.    i'm sorry you're caught in the middle, but your mom's gonna need all the help she can get.    and one more thing,  i'm glad your mom is leaving someone that gets violent and yells.|`|d20mM90uaa	it is NOT your fault  i would def tell your parents how you feel  i have a 15 yr old and we are in the same situation and she tells me how she feels and we work things out as best we can   we don't get child support either, he is disable and don't have disablity

mxIYhkAnaa	Sister, Allaahu alim, we have a little car (it does just fit two childrenseats) and my husbands makes every month about 1500 euro. and my husband uses the car only to go to the grocery shop on saturday to buy for the next 1 or 2 weeks. He works and pays the bills and that is how he takes care of us. He buys new clothing more often for himself than for me, but he must present himself more often and move from there to there. So his trousers comes more often to his end.  And i say to him that he should buy for himself instead of for me. I don't need a new trouser whenever he needs a new one. Than i have now over 25 trousers in this winter.... I don't need a car to be able to go to the grocery store to buy things, even if my husband didn't did the grocery shopping. What is wrong with walking or going on a bike? If he doesn't want to pay of her school debts, ya Allaah, i don't no how to bring it, with the money i received from the goverment (as compensation for the fact i was studying) i payed off the debt i had for my studybooks.... He didn't. It was there before i entered the marriage. A marriage doesn't mean, okay i have a debt you should pay it off. He can pay it off, where are her parents? They agreed with the debts of her study right? This is a result of living on a American feet (spend more than you have). Totally different than a European feet (spend more for what you need). In the Arab world no men would want to stay married with a woman that complains and makes her wishes into needs.     "How wonderful is the situation of the believer, for everything is good for him, and this applies only to the believer. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks for it, and this is good for him; if something bad befalls him, he bears it with patience, and this is also good for him." (reported by Muslim, may Allah have mercy on him, in al-Saheeh, no. 2999    Her rights are food and clothing on reasonable basis, accommodation and the mahr (dowry). Non financial are kind treatment and she should be not be harmed. A car is a luxe and not a thing that is needed. Paying of her study debt is a sunnah thing to do for her, but not fard to do so.. In my eyes, this sister had to rethink her study over, when she accepted this (islaam) and that (her marriage), why didn't she talked this problem over with her waliy before the aqd al nikkah? Why did she starts untill now to complain about the situation after a baby has come?     In my eyes, she hasn'tt got a reason to complain, she is treated being nice, has clothing enough, (she doesn't walk naked, i assume), he buys for her and the baby food, they have a roof upon their head. If she wants to get off her study debt, she shouldn't throw it upon the husband (to resolve it) after marriage. Because to be honest i feel that this is just one side of the story and not two sides. And the side of the woman is always more emotional than based on fact. the way you present this "problem", i can see that you stand on her side (woman with woman) what did your husband had to say?     Why didn't you post this question in the Ramadan section?           Sometimes i feel ashamed of sisters, that have the urgue to claim that they need things they do not really need. The things you n|`|ft8t98Pnaa	LOL....she better get her *** a loan and get her own car.. STOP DEPENDING ON A MAN...|`|Q5BM2POnaa	Muslim or not, $600 a week is simply not enough money to raise a family on.    Aside from a communication problem, their main issue is an income problem.  Even if they eventually agree they don't need a car, they still can't sustain their family (assuming she's a SAHM) on his $600/week.    They need to sit down and make a plan for how to increase their income, and worry about the car later.  Even a cheap beater car would cost more than they have, not to mention the insurance.    I would recommend either he get a 2nd job or she get a part-time job on his off hours.  That would be a short term fix.  For the long term they should look into what he (or she) needs to get into a better paying line of work: more school, better company, etc.    If he won't change jobs and is stubborn about doing anything different, then she has a choice; stay with him and remain poor, or divorce him and be poor for a while, while she reorganizes her life and eventually finds a guy who is more considerate of how his actions impact others.|`|5ViTUTyZaa	Obviously he is human and is capable of behaving like a jerk, regardless of what religion he is.  My husband is Muslim but acts like a jerk sometimes.  I think your friend should get a job and pay off her loans and contribute to the household.  I don't know how you are making it on less than her, but they are bringing in $2400 a month.  For a family of 3 that is very very low income.  If she thought marrying a muslim and converting to Islam meant that her marriage would be easy (I really love the marriage guidance provided in the Koran, I really wish it was in the bible too) she was wrong because there is the human factor involved.|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	You use the word "need" a lot.

lV8i73unaa	Calla Lillies would be beautiful!  But, be sure to consult with your florist, to be certain that whatever flower/flowers you narrow it down to will be in season!  If they aren't, you may have to pay extra to have them imported, if they are available at all. It would be horrible to have your mind set on something that you can't have, and have to make a snap decision at the last minute!    Congratulations!!!     *smile*|`|yhgRaBPXaa	Blue was a really hard color! I had it in my wedding, but ended up using blue delphiniums. They come in several shades of blue and are relatively inexpensive. My florist also said that they could dye a lot of other flowers too, but it was very costly.|`|tBODwcqXaa	I would suggest hydrangeas. I just wrote an article about a winter wedding on my blog at www.somethingbluebook.com. There is a picture of the flowers there if you'd like to see.     Good luck!|`|5db88cbaf3527eb6e504255901eb58cfaa	Your florist can best answer that...they have books to look in, also arrangements and different flowers online.  Good luck.|`|vk6sczbLaa	This site has a lot of pictures and suggestions for what to do with aqua blue: http://www.favorideas.com/wedding-themes...    It mostly shows white roses, but there's a beach wedding idea that has orchids and another idea with yellow roses.
s6YmD7vaaa	RE: Closest "ring bearer" MOH - Since you can't choose how about this?... Place them according to height from shortest to tallest, or vice versa - whichever makes YOU look best!    RE: The Toast - Have the 3 MOHs & 3 Best Men give their toasts together.  If the 2 trios worked out a good routine together the toasts could prove to be fun & memorable.    Good Luck & Congratulations!|`|0jUGSaZPaa	You can have them still all give a toast...  Or suggest that all three of them get together and write one together.  It will cut back on time.    And as far as what order... Do it by something simple...  Whether it's age, height, how long you've known them... That way it doesn't look like your picking favorites...    Hope this helps!!|`|55zWUXcUaa	Have one stand next to you during the wedding have another give the toast and the third can get a special duty as well...  Maybe she gets to plan the bachelorette party or the shower.|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	Tell them to combine their thoughts into one speech. Or tell them they have a 1.5 minute maximum, or something like that.  About which stands closest to you, just think about which of them stood closest to you in your life.|`|8g51eBf1aa	If your having a family member as a MOH then choose a family member over a friend to stand next to you. If not choose then choose one that's closes to you, and that you do everything with! Have the best men and MOH's all prepare a 30 second toast.|`|vdgQKhuPaa	I agree with other comments, give them a "could you come up with a 90 second toast?" time limit.    The person who is your family member should stand closest to you, (such as sister) or if no family is involved, the friend you have known the longest (and ordered that way).  You should tell the others that they are no less important to you and that you had a very difficult time with this, but this was the only way to choose (by length of time you've known them).  If they are truly your friends they will understand!|`|XVW4XN45aa	I was just in the same position that you are in, don't go with 3 MOH, choose one...I had 3 friends that i am equally close with..so i went with who i knew the longest!!! i knew one since kinder garden, one since 3rd grade and another since 7th. so i went with the one i knew the longest...everyone was ok with this, its your wedding do what makes you Happy!
6717z0vkaa	of course it can be, but very rare.  you never know tho, they could also be hiding something  don't give away addresses and stuff. you know the speech be careful    = ]  just wondering ur age . .  and i hope the best for you|`|e98RKB35aa	I am not a big fan of this.

53aUYsqtaa	One of the most confusing and puzzling question can be trying to figure out does he like me or not. Most guys tend to send out mixed signals which often makes it really confusing for most girls to figure out whether he likes them or not. You can never be hundred percent sure about whether he likes you or not yet there are certain ways to figure out what he is actually looking for. Read on to discover some of the proven ways to figure out whether he likes you or not.    He would smile at you a lot- When a guy likes you he would tend to smile more than usual when he is looking at you. You can always make out from a guys smile whether he likes you or not just based on the way he smiles. If he passes an invitational smile towards you as if he is willing to have a word than he definitely likes you.    Finds a reason to have a word with you- If a guy likes you than he would find all possible reasons to get in conversation with you and would be willing to get your attention as much as possible. The best way to guess whether he likes you or not is to simply read between his lines. When a guy normally tends to like a girl he would always give small hints within the conversation that he fancies you and would love to go out with you.    Catch his stare- This is probably one of the best ways to figure out whether a guy likes you or not. If he likes you than he would stare at you in a different manner different from how he looks at other people.    He keeps looking- If a guy likes you than he would keep looking towards you even after you have had a word with him. For example he would always keep looking at you even if you pass by him. The best way to find out whether he is looking or not is to simply turn your head around and catch his stare.    Constantly tries to impress you- When a guy tries to impress girl than he definitely likes her. If he is always dressed well around you and tries to present himself in the best of his behavior than he is definitely likes you and is waiting for an indication or signal from your side.|`|yULWldR4aa	In group situations i always find whoever the person has the most eye contact with they have the closest relationship with and they look to them for support and care about their feedback and what they feel.    I'd say you've got a good chance.    Either that or you had a bit of food on your face! lol joke|`|VX7B5TV2aa	Well i think he might like you because he's talking to you abit more, but this could just be him being friendly. When he is with his friend and you are with yours you have more people to talk to but when you are alone you are the only person that he can talk to other than himself lol somehow i doubt he will do that though. I hope i helped if i didn't im sorry. You could always ask him out to see what he says or you could try talking to him.  i hope i did help.    xxxx|`|ifNr13kfaa	I'm actually an agnostic, and I've dated a Jehovah's Witness.  She was the most amazing girl, but because I was such a good guy in many ways, she said that she couldn't concentrate on her God because she was starting to put me first (i.e. we broke up).  Regardless, guy's are morons when it comes to guys noticing whether or not a girl likes them.  Talk to him more often, if you noticably go out of your way to see him or talk to him, it makes a very bright shining impression.  If the only time you ever see him is from across the room, it makes things very hard.  You need to have an invested friendship with this kid especially if you want to start seeing him exclusively.  Ask him and a few of his friends if they want to go do something with you and a few of your girlfriends - this way you two are not alone, yet you have a way to make a stronger connection to him.  Honestly, to make a good relationship work drop everything you know about being you and part of your religion, and just be a girl for once.  You'll be surprised at the results.  Or you can just continue the curious stares at each other from 20+ ft away...your choice lady.  Either way, good luck in getting the guy.|`|aqmRZebEaa	It really sounds like it and if he wasn't looking at the person that was talking and he was looking at u, that shows that he likes to look at u which may mean he thinks it pretty.|`|kNFH5lKnaa	seems like it, you have a chance.  Good Luck!
QPY5awssaa	No. She just knows what she wants and knows that she doesn't have to lower her standards just to get someone b/c she can take care of herself.

She sounds like she really cares about each relationship she has.|`|CMQ2bUVOaa	Sounds like an ideal woman! Unless you're looking for a shorter relationship... if she's selective and only wants long-term, it sounds as though she wants to settle down with mr right.     As for being high headed, i don't think so.. she sounds rather modest to me really. At least it isn't "I'm a fit big-boobed blonde with blue eyes, out for some fun ;) "!!|`|AA11599488	High headed??  You sound like most other girls in your position. I have to say though if you go looking for a long term relationship immediately you can scare off people you may be destined to be with (if you believe in that) or may be a good match with because they hadn't considered a long term relationship and may be open to it if there is no pressure from the start.|`|AA12340630	She sounds like a horror!

i15KoiJhaa	Tall, dark and handsome is typically going to win out over short, and unattractive... I think most people would feel this way.    The kicker is... not everyone thinks the same thing is attractive.  To one person a Man may be very good looking and to her friend she is wondering WTF you're seeing!?    Money vs Little Funds... my feeling on that is as long as the Guy has ambition and is doing honest work, the money isn't an issue for me.    Men with a healthy head of hair vs those guys who are the poster child for rogaine.... LOL again, depends on the person and what they find attractive, some Women dig bald...so ya never know. Me personally prefer my Hubby with his dark, black hair... but if it went away I would still be attracted to him.    Thank Goodness we don't all like the same thing or look the same way.... it would be a pretty boring world.|`|RvFwmQOPaa	We as humans are normally attracted to looks first because that is the first thing we see. So, I would say that the tall and handsome guy would get a woman's attention first over the short and unattractive man. But, it is sometimes difficult for a handsome guy to be approached by women because some may  be intimidated by his looks or assume that he is already taken. As for the short and unattractive guy, he has to work harder at getting a woman to notice him by using his personality or by playing up other attributes that he may have to offer.  Men that are financially wealthy have a better chance of meeting more women over those earning median to below salaries. I feel they have more access to women because they usually travel more, shop more, go out to places that are nice where women may go. Where men that have less money may frequent places that are less expensive and less desirable to women.  Men with hair may have a better chance than men with no hair or balding in some cases. It depends on what the woman is attracted to|`|qEH9dbT9aa	of course the ladies would want the biggest catch. but the inside is the one that matters of course. if you have both, thats a big bonus! just make sure you're not ugly in the inside. now THAT'S a bigger turn off rather than some bald disease.|`|gIfVABHhaa	stature/looks: yes of course, tall and handsome, i don't know how george does it    money: meh, moneys not that important unless he's a leech    hair: hair yes.. but i'm a teen so of course i don't want a balding cradle snatcher    but these are just shallow attributes. there's a lot more to it|`|3ctchU2faa	I go for guys who have a great sense of humor, can have an intelligent conversation with me, and can be comfortable around my friends.   If he can handle that, than it doesn't matter what he looks like, its who he is on the inside that makes him attractive.|`|PSsVYQTmaa	Honestly I'm sure someone who is tall and handsome is more likely to catch our eye at first, BUT personality is a HUGE factor. It can be the most handsome man in the whole world, but if he has a bad personality, that makes him ugly in my eyes. If I happen to meet the short and unattractive man and he has an awesome personality and can make me laugh, I would absolutley choose him over the good looking guy with a bad personality. however if the handsome guy has a personality to match, he wins.|`|WDlYwi8aaa	well, as long as he's got a big ****, i'm good.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	I would only date a guy who I found attractive.  That's typically not society's version of attractive either.  So I'm not sure how to answer the first question.  I want a guy who's taller than me (which doesn't take much) and who I find attractive.  Whether he's dark or not, I don't care.  Whether society thinks he's hot, I don't care.  As long as I think he's good looking, that's who I'll take.    As long as you're happy in your job, I'll take you.  Sure, money is nice.  I like to travel, but just because you're working minimum wage while you try to find full-time employment doesn't mean I'm going to ignore you.  In this crappy economy, money would win out, all other things being equal.  But I don't want a guy who is so rich that he drives an expensive car (they're totally pointless), lives in a house that's much bigger than he needs (no way am I cleaning that), or flaunts his money around like that makes him somebody special.  So I guess I'll take a median salary; I hate arrogance.    I love bald men, so...  :)
XuxZPdNdaa	The nation has fallen into a slump... and it's affecting some more than others... To help, try hanging around friends, be more sociable, or go see a doctor to get some depression meds...

You have to force yourself to get out and join some kind of activity that will involve being with other people. Even if you don't feel like making friends, just being in the same place with other persons will help you feel better. It is going to be tough at first, but the more you try, the easier it gets.

pZUnS37xaa	I think it's completly normal, I'm 18 and I have a boyfriend now, but I didn't want one for a long time. All my friends were dating as well, but I liked being single and having my freedom.     Just because you don't like anyone now doesn't mean you won't, the right person just hasn't came along yet.     As far as your friends that have rushed into things and have done "the deed" lol they will probaly wished they would have waited to be in love because it means a lot more, it's definalty something worth waiting for.|`|205ce36b2214521105667ecdc666b6c5aa	there's nout wrong with that. it just means that ether all the boys who are around you are ignorant of you, or you're just not interested. There's a life and your future ahead. the past means nothing.and the present means little more|`|2qU2M8OYaa	okay well. i think you just arnet giving boys a chance maybe you just dont want too be commited too someone yet and not ready for relationship. Its fine dont worry|`|9FpCN81Maa	Yeah its normal. And trust me, you aren't missing out on much. All the people who are going around and sleeping around with their boyfriends and girlfriends at 16 are going to get hurt in the end. Cause these things don't last forever. Your lucky cause you can actually wait till you meet someone you actually like and can have a serious relationship with.      Hope this helps|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	How wonderful to hear from a 16 year old that is not obsessed with sex and boys. You sound fantastic and well adjusted, sooner or later you will meet someone and you will know he is the one.  Dont be like your so called friends who sleep with boys, that is a waste of time unless there is love involved.|`|ZR34thBvaa	Freak.|`|Q5FYrU9vaa	maybe ur just not ready for a relationship simple as that|`|gXldpzCFaa	ok your are not alone many girls have the same feeling as you do well im a guy how had the same problem as you did some years ago im 18 now and well ben dating for awile ben going out with this girl for 3 years and well it took some time before i started dating so dont worry you do not have a problem with your self but you are not ready if you dont want to be ready ok hoped this advice help|`|A3fYo8eYaa	Maybe your just not ready. Sure there's nothing bad about it. Just tell them you don't want a boyfriend.They're not going to pressurise you unless they're not your real friends. Just wait for the right person and then you'll be ready but don't feel bad about not wanting a relationship.  Good Luck!|`|GmTMVmASaa	nothing is wrong with you! you're just not ready and that's as normal as everyone else. i'd say you're smart and taking your time, and i admire that in someone so young.|`|rNNvAcq4aa	lesbian|`|pX8qJzjIaa	dating in high school is all drama, I waited until I graduated and it was the best decision.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	everyones body is different and so are the way hormones react.. if u feel ur not ready i see nothing wrong with it..u just seem to be more smart and mature about dating anyone..dont date or do anything u dont feel its right for you ..take ur time u will be happy u did.. good luck|`|2jSX5nQkaa	i wouldnt say your a lesbian, but if you are that awsome.  you just dont want to have to deal with anything right now.  but to go out and have some fun with a few friends and guys isnt so bad.  you just havnt found the right person to date yet|`|NFAfG3YWaa	just because were teens doesnt mean that we are suppossed to be acting everything on our hormones..

4hkM3HXyaa	I don't see how their past weight would have an impact on how you feel about them in the present.     What's past is past.    It does speak about their determination though, losing weight is hard, keeping it off is even harder.|`|O46f8wl3aa	If you're truely interested weight *shouldn't* play an issue. With the politically correct crap outta the way, to have a good relationship there has to be passion... if you're not passionate enough about the person to get over the weight thing you prolly shouldn't date them.    Me personally? I like the heavy set men... Skinny boys bruise my inner thighs...|`|gD2wimkvaa	no not at all. a persons personality is what is really alluring to me. and who cares if you were once heavy set. that was in the past. people should live in the moment.|`|X7CAxzXEaa	i think i would probably gain respect for that person.  anyone who is willing to admit they have a problem and need to fix it is a good thing.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Absolutely not....it shows a determination and drive that is probably applied in everything a person does.|`|E5iFR6BJaa	Yes.....my opinions would change about him. It makes me wonder why he could change, what.....minds that makes him change like that. Because I know changing from overweight is a very very very hard thing to do. He must have found something that keeps him motivated to get on a diet.    And that would totally changed what I used to thought of that person. He might be someone who actually understand about a certain situation, when I wasn't think like that.|`|iTUugOTLaa	It's not a turn-on nor a turn-off. My girlfriend was once a bit chubby, so what? I still like her just as much, knowing that or not knowing that.|`|CLOtMCwSaa	No not really, I would have to say that I would hope that they can keep that weight off though, I am a small guy, 5' 10" and about 150 lbs. Very slim, and athletic body type. I can hardly gain anyweight, ever. but I understand that not everyone is like me, and I would just hope that they could watch themselves. Hope this helps. TTYL.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	So what if they were once overweight? Your interest in them should be for more than physical now or then. Just because someone is overweight at any time doesn't make them a different person inside. I hope your interest/attraction is for something that's in their heart and spirit and not just their looks.|`|VpSdtbSNaa	yeah..I might respect them more.  its hard to lose weight..very hard.|`|JyvG8dFcaa	no..but it would give me some insight into their life...|`|Wg4oXaICaa	It wouldn't bother me one bit, considering that I'm a little over weight myself.|`|n59qRDUHaa	I think that I would be concerned about them going back to old habits. But if you get to love him, then your tolerance will increase.|`|l4WmTyM7aa	Nope. Unless it's something really serious (like being arrested and convicted and such), I don't care about a person's past. Plus, if they were /once/ overweight, I'd know that they had an even better quality--determination to get over that.  In short, I wouldn't think it matters.|`|sv6Y6t8Qaa	Nah.    If they WERE in the past, then no I don't think it would change.    But if they ARE now, then yes duh I wouldn't feel attracted.    Hope that HELPS  :}|`|0HVO9LgQaa	i think that if u love that person it shouldnt matter if they are over weight or not! and for them to admit that they were and then lose it shows that they are a brave person! but if your that shallow then be an ***! i just think that if u love some one size wouldnt matter! the more important question is would u love someone if they were bad in bed lol!
u7f0QB37aa	The only right you have is if she decides to keep it is pay child support and if you are lucky and pay lawyers and the court get some type of visitation    But look at it this way your hands will be clean of bloodshed if you tried to stop her from having the abortion    I know this first hand my ex is a Dr. and we got pregnant while she was third year of medical school and she decided on her on to abort i wish she would have never even told me she was pregnant it would be easier, she said nothing was going to stand in the way of her goal of becoming a Dr. even if it meant murdering our child i divorced her 3 years later i lost all respect for her, i figured if she could kill her own flesh and blood she was capable of killing anyone even me.    And just think this woman took a oath to save lives.|`|mvKDbb2uaa	I know many women WILL say that this is purely the woman's choice--she's pregnant, she has to carry the baby, it's her body.  In a way yes and no.      I think that if you are a part of this woman's life, that it's a choice that you both have to come to together.  Ultimately, you will both have to reconcile yourselves and your relationship to this choice you make whether you choose to keep the baby or go through with an abortion.  Too many times the woman takes that stance of "it's my body solely and therefore solely my choice" and forget that there is another person involved and that the decision that is made will affect him just as much as it will her.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	You have a voice. But, realistically, women have 100% reproductive control: your voice will only count if she is inclined to listen to you. It's not a matter of ethics - it's a matter of common sense. If a woman is bent on having an abortion, nothing you say or do will stop her - even if you are "technically" right.    Now, I'm guessing that maybe what you're asking is whether or not there should be a legal requirement for the father's consent before an abortion can be performed. Well, in this case, shouldn't there also be a requirement the other way around - shouldn't the father's consent be required when making a decision to KEEP the baby? Why should it only go one way? It makes sense that, being that having a child is a bid responsibility, both parents must consent to it. Yet, it is not so: traditionally, in our culture, the woman is the final decision-maker when it comes to reproductive choices. I would guess that it's probably because she has more at stake, and she usually ends up being more invested in raising the child. So, she gets to decide whether to have the child (even against the father's wishes) or to have an abortion (even against the father's wishes). If only two people are involved, one of them HAS to have the final say, otherwise how would you resolve deadlock situations where one person wants one thing and the other wants exactly the opposite? So, it seems that being that the woman bears the brunt of carrying (and often rearing) the child, she gets to be the "majority partner" when making this decision.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Abortion is always wrong.  And Abortion is always murder.    Do not judge, God will take his own vengeance, which he promises to take.|`|66e03546d71298a34daadeb6dce02da6aa	Yes, Just like non-slaveholding northerners had a say on slavery before the civil war.  Its a universal moral question, not a private one.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I am not a lib by any stretch of the imagination.  However, I do believe you have a voice in the abortion issue.  But only the issue.  I do not believe a man has the right to stop an abortion or to insist on his wife having one.|`|07cdc5710ed692974b09c64c65058e4aaa	Post this in the Woman's Gender sections... Society & Culture - you will get hit with the feminist movement you are looking for.  Too many "younger" peeps here that have no clue what you are saying.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	I understand you and believe this. No man should have the right to tell a woman whether or not she is to birth a child. However, neither should the state require a man to support a child that he explicitly told the woman he did not want.    EDIT:    VERY WELL SAID BROTHER OTTER!!!!!|`|16vMIGPiaa	Opinions are like ...  (you know the rest)  Everybody's got one.    The issue of who has "a voice" is about what each of us will, or will not, stand for having happen in the world.  It's about ethical or moral or philosophical convictions.  We choose what we believe and then act accordingly.    The declaration that "You aren't entitled to an opinion" is a specious dismissal.  It's an implicit Ad Homonim attack - attempting to invalidate a point by invalidating the person making it.  If you have a conviction about something, have chosen a position and a message on a particular subject, then you become a messenger.  Doesn't matter whether anyone thinks you're right to carry the message or not, your job is to do it well.  It really doesn't matter what the topic is.  Abortion just happens to be a serious hot button.  And there are an awful lot of men that have strong opinions about it...|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	I understand your point. I really am not sure as to the answer. I guess, ideally, you would have a choice. However, if the man forced the woman to be pregnant and promised to raise the child, etc., isn't that almost the same thing as a woman saying-sorry, my body, my right?    I do think it is difficult for all parties involved.|`|ooT1Gj2Xaa	It should be a mutual agreement.     A man has the choice of wearing protection when fornicating to avoid any "mishaps".     Abortion should not be looked at as a form of birth control.|`|AA11328507	Seeing how a man can want a woman to have an abortion and if she refuses he still has to pay child support, I feel a man should have a say in the decision of abortion...the BIG issue is say you wanted your girl to keep the baby and she didn't want to...WHO gets to decide?  A judge?  A doctor?.. because no one, especially an outsider, should have a say in such a personal matter and since the woman ultimately has to carry the child..it makes the best sense that the decision lays with her.      This whole scenario is why birth control conversations need to be taught at early ages at home and school.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	Abortion is such a heated issue that I think often times people get lost in forest because they can't see the trees. Abortion is technically a woman's choice and a woman's perogative. However if the only reason she is having the abortion is as a form of birth control and the father wants the child, she should consider having the child and letting the father have it. I have never been able to understand why it is "too hard to give the baby up" but not too hard to abort it.     However, the are many other reasons that abortions become necessary. Primarily I am thinking of medical issues. Had I not had an abortion, I would be dead from cancer right now instead of being here raising my other seven children. In an instance like that, only one person can make the decision, the mother.     Everyone is entitled to their opinion, can voice that opinion. The ability to do so is what makes our country great. However in the reality of the situation, only two opinions count. The mother's and the father's.|`|AA11309717	As a man here is what I would tell you. The women that tell you that it's basically none of your business are telling this to you for a reason, because it's none of your business unless you are personally involved. I know this is not necessarily what you want to hear but it's true. Would you want someone telling what to do with your life? Do you know what the actual situation is for each of these women? You don't? When you delve into someones life without asking if you can, what do expect them to do? I know from a personal standpoint if it was my life that you were sticking your nose into I'd probably act the same way unless we were very good friends or I'd asked your opinion or something of that nature. Now if you are a lobbyist you should be used to such reactions, right? Even if you are involved with the person who is pregnant you only have so much say so because ultimately it is her body and it is up to her to decide. Remember everyone is entitled to an opinion, but you have to be smart enough to know when your opinion is wanted. I too am against abortion    Hope this helps!|`|ZadDprTxaa	As a responsible party in the upbringing of a child, you (as a man) should have some say.  But the truth is, ultimately, she has to make the decision (when it comes to abortion) because she is the one that will be caring for the child as it initially grows.  Unfortunately, men really don't have much right in the say of a child until he/she gets into this world.     Despite my rational answer, I am against abortion.|`|g0ax1LgEaa	You have an opinion on abortion, but there will ALWAYS be a woman who says you have no right because you're a man. You have every right to your opinion as I do to mine, but I would never push it on someone else.    I agree with another poster that said that you have a right to have an opinion but not to stop someone or force someone to have one.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Are you getting an abortion?  Frankly I think it should be the woman's decision - it's her body.  It may be unfair to the guys but at least there's a choice.  I think in most cases the guys would be jumping through the roof if half of their girlfriends/flings/whatevers would get an abortion...|`|Gx14PIvxaa	Personally, I think it's pathetic that a woman can go have an abortion in secret and the father knows nothing. Unfortunately, that's one of the trade-offs for the rights of the ones that are victims and MUST do it in secret.    I think that if you are in a loving relationship with someone, you will respect each others' opinions regarding what to do if you had an unplanned pregnancy. If you can't talk as adults about the matter and you don't see eye-to-eye on such a basic issue, then you aren't mature or emotionally or mentally ready for sex, anyway.|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	You are right that men are quickly dismissed with regards to the abortion decision because this is something that solely resides within a woman's body.      The only stand that a man can take is whether or not abortion should be allowed at all.  It the whole pro this or that debate.    However, as  of right now men have no recourse to whether a woman decides to abort a pregnancy or take it to term.  We as men however, are stuck with paying child support for children was may not want because a woman decides to go full term.    In truth their should be a third option where a man can sign away his rights to being a father and any financial responsibility connected to that child.  This would be the only way the potential father could have any true say as his choice to be a father or not.|`|i15KoiJhaa	Everyone is entitled to their opinion on Abortion or any other topic regardless of race, religion, gender or age.    As each one of us are entitled to agree, disagree or have points to make.    It doesn't meant that anyone person is right or wrong for that matter. It means that we are a melting pot with different views on all topics and subjects.    Certain subjects people become very passionate about and if anyone differs with that point of view it seems often times it becomes a battle of the wills, put downs and getting off topic more so then being a rational, intelligent debate on different views and abortion is certainly a topic that most people seem to have a take on regardless of gender.
7b2543f014645ca0e174d68a6e38c580aa	Yes there are lot of wedding planning website. So far I found the below website can help you what you are desiring.    http://www.marryplanning.com/Going-to-Sc...|`|0jUGSaZPaa	Check out a lot of DIY (do it yourself) sites...  Even just for ideas.    Such as...  http://www.save-on-crafts.com/  http://marthastewartweddings.com/portal/...    These helped me think of ideas for my centerpieces, favors, etc.    I hope this helps some!!|`|E7LQp6VRaa	I didn't read all the answers but have you tried Ebay?    We have planned a lot of our wedding on Ebay.  We have gotten our flowers there, cake topper, place card holders etc...  We have saved a lot of money...|`|AA11760899	I can help! How many people, what is your budget? What kind of wedding do you want?     For websites, brides.com, theknot.com, do a google search. They are out there.    Ok, I am copying and pasting another answer here that I did just a few minutes ago. i am finding that alot more people are doing weddings on small budgets and that we are all going back to the old fashioned way of wedding receptions. Of course, depending on your location, lifestyle, expectations, and religion, some of these may or may not work for you. If you want to really keep your budget than you can Definately do this. You will just have to take a step back and not conform to the wedding industry's "rules", and not get caught up in the materialism of it. Remember, have fun with the process, dont get to stressed and dont get sucked in to expensive packages and always shop around! You might also have to change any visions or expectaions that you may or may not have had.   Goodluck and have fun!!!!      Ok, this is possible. I am not sure where you live, but when picking out the food, do finger foods, cold salads, mini sandwiches, or just a dessert and punch reception.  You can always have the wedding outside in a park, or someones yard.   The tents might be a bit pricey, so shop around, or look into awnings, or tarping. You might be able to find a white tarp, or nicer color tarp and having a friend or some family helping you put it up.  For tables and chairs, look around at your local firehouse, elks lodge, schools, funeral home, bingo hall, etc. to see if they will rent you out some chairs and/or tables for a low price, or check with someone you might know who could get this for free. You can also look for some picnic tables, ask around also at local venues, or parks, or groves to see if they will let you borrow them.  Stick to paper or plastic plates and cutlery, napkins and cups. For the drinks if you dont want to do alcohol (since that can get pretty pricey) look into soda, punch, water, tea, or juices.  If its at night and you want lighting, use christmas lights and candles. They are cheap!    if you want it inside, than contact again, the local firehouses, sometimes they have a space tehre. or local moose lodge, VFW, Elks lodge, school(sometimes they rent out gymnasiums), fairgrounds, any unconventional space you can think of really. Get creative and think of what do you have around you? You will never know who is willing to get some business to host a party. most of these places like the Elks club might even cook for you or let you use their kitchen.   If you want a restaurant, try family restaurants, or casual restaurants. they will have cheaper options, with I am sure great food!   You can also ask to see if they have just and appetizer packages. You can get a bunch of lower cost hor d'urves or apps. menu, that can also serve as a meal.   Some places might also let you do just a cake and punch receptoin, or you can also have this option at a place where you can bring your own food and have your family make some desserts.   For dessert, you can have some family or friends do that cake or cookies, or go to your local grocery store who will do a cake for you.I if you do the cake yourself, or have someone do it for you wal-mart sells fondant kits (the icing that makes the cake look really pretty) in the craft/wedding section.  For music, if you are comftorable having just an MP3 player or stereo do that! If not, maybe have a friend or someone that does DJing on the side do it for a cheaper price.  Photographer. Have a freind or family do this also. Or, have a college student do your picks for you for a discount price. They will gladly take much less than a professional is asking for.  Do you have your dress yet? If not, check out craigslist, and ebay. Go to a local bridal shop to find your size. And find a dress you like and get it off the itnernet if you can. Or find a dress off the rack. Lots of options out there now a days for a dress. For a veil, make it yourself! Tulle costs maybe $2-$4 a yard in a craft store. Why pay $200 for it??  Where are you having the actual ceremony? If you are catholic and your church mandates a fee, try going to a Born-again christian church if you want to get married in church. They charge a lot less. Or if you are member of your church or synogauge call them and see what they can do.  If not and you are not a church goer, then a justice of the peace will only charge around 100 dollars. Make sure you put the marriage certificate in the budget! Its only about 30 bucks or so, but dont overlook it.  for the rings, try goldspeed.com. Thats where I got my fiances ring for $220. Or, try sears. I got mine there for $160 on the after christmas clearance. try department stores that are going out of business (in this day and age, that shouldnt be hard to do).    Skip the favors!! No one keeps those anyway. Lose the centerpieces, Or just use the candle lighting for those. Skip fancy linens. Go to the dollar store and get those plastic table covers. They come in all sorts of nice colors! skip place cards and table cards. Let people seat themselves.  Have your fiance wear a nice dress shirt and dress pants, he doenst need a tux, just to look nice.  Flowers- you do not need a boatload of flowers for a wedding no matter how many people say you do. For your bouquet, go to a local grocery store and grap some of those pre-made bouquets in the flower department. Have your maids, if you are having any care just one flower or rose, and have the groom and groomsmen wear a flower, or a fern for their boutinare and make them yourself!  For the invitations make or print them yourself. and make sure you put postage in your budget.    For decorations, if you have it outside, you wont need any!   if you have it inside, try balloons, they are a fun and inexpensive alternative. You|`|gtunOva2aa	I'm in the same boat with you! I'm planning my wedding on a budget of about $2,000.. I use theknot.com, they have some great ideas, though their budget ideas are a little off, i think. Depending on where and when you're getting married, you may have a lot of options, or just a few. What I did was get on Google, and do a search of what area you're looking to be wed. Also, some venues will give you a small discount if you wet married on a weekday, as opposed to a weekend. Send me a message if you have any other questions (or ideas) :) Hope this helps a bit.|`|xKZzScJ8aa	I have a $5K budget and it's a destination wedding. Here is what is helping me keep the costs down:    Using Fiance's grandmother's ranch as the ceremony venue  Making my own save the dates: using business cards and business card magnets  Making my own invitations: using really nice ones that I found at Walmart for $20 for 100  Making my own centerpieces using silk flowers  Having a friend who owns a restaurant cater the reception for us as their wedding gift (buffet, not sit down meal)  Makeup and hair is being done by my fiance's cousin as a wedding gift  Only serving wine and beer as the alcohol choices  Negotiated with a local band for double the hours for their regular price  Giving toating glasses as part favor so this doubles http://www.discountmugs.com/us/index.php...    If you know someone who owns/work for a vendor you are needing, ask them for a discount. In these struggling times, we have the upper hand. The vendors need us, we don't need them. There is always someone cheaper out there and they know it.      Just remember to negotiate EVERYTHING!!!|`|gK0vcdnDaa	I second theknot.com, thie budgeter is a little off, but it will give you basic idea of where to spend what then you can pick and choose where you want to spend more/less money.    They also have a lot of options for customizing a personal (free) wedding web-page and it has all of the information you could imagine. You can add a password and your friends can sign the guestbook. You can post registry information which is nice because then that takes away the pressure of "where are you registered?" :)    In addition theknot is a great resouce for so many other things, like ideas, coupons, favors, accessories & more! They have a budgeter and a checklist so that you don't forget anything - for the DIY Bride it is a MUST!! It's been a life saver.    Good Luck!  -Elle

It just looked retarded.  But in practice it's a pretty good show.  Part of the fun is how merciless they are to Meg, who doesn't do anything to deserve it.    I used to love South Park but after a while they seemed to go for shocking instead of funny, and it lost its appeal to me.    I haven't seen Scrubs, though I imagine I'd enjoy it.|`|95uXmC94aa	family guy fo sho :) Hands down :D|`|QTxdNavKaa	Family Guy is good :)|`|CZFcH1ykaa	Scrubs   I can't really see the humor in Family Guy.|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	scrubs|`|BdA59Tr0aa	FAMILY GUY!!!

0jUGSaZPaa	No... Spruce it up with some cute hair accessories, like a flower, rhinestone clips, headbands...    I don't think you need your hair professionally done all the time for weddings...  I have seen lots of girls let their hair go...|`|nqINitkmaa	That's pretty long... personally I don't think it looks good when women have hair that long that they leave down... or really ever.. just my opinion do what you want..|`|0Id85yiYaa	cut loose|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	It sounds like you must have beautiful hair and no reason not to wear it down if that is what you prefer!!    Here are a couple links about brides wearing their hair down on their wedding day, if they can do it, you certainly can.    Congrats!|`|L38M9lrLaa	i would wear my hair down with loose curls..sounds pretty. deff not wrong|`|kUE3Ddktaa	There is nothing right or wrong about wearing your hair loose. Do what you think will make it look nice for a special occasion.|`|gtunOva2aa	I don't think it would be inappropriate at all. I also have insanely long hair, and i think if you can stand wearing it down, wear it down. Maybe bring some scrunchies or rubber band with you just in case. If you do decide to wear it up at the wedding, you can always excuse yourself to the restroom and put it up in a bun or the classic "fold-up".|`|UUQXNhMtaa	Tasha you are 16, it is perfectly acceptable to wear your hair loose, you might want to pull it up on either side and put that hair in a decorative clasp at the back of your head  for a more dressy look. Or perhaps pull it up and flip it to the underside and place a flower like the ones in the wedding in it. My granddaughter is 19 and wears her hair at waist length, she pulls it into a pony tail when she is at work( she is a dog groomer) to keep it out of the way. At home though she wears it down a lot.  She is getting married in Dec and is only pulling her hair up part of the way not wearing it up entirely, and she is the bride.
ifgzHzA3aa	I make jewelry as well.  I have made jewelry for several friends and have only charged them what it cost for the materials.  I've also helped out with planning and what not even though I was not in the wedding.  I did all this, one, because that's what friends do (help each other) and two, I enjoy planning events and having projects to do.  So, in doing all this, the friends usually want to thank me in some way and I always tell them it's not necessary.  In the end, I usually end up with a gift card or something that I have no choice but to accept.  I have never expected anything in return, other than knowing that I have helped out a friend and made them happy.    To sum up, as long as you continually express your sincere appreciation for all that she has done, I'm sure she expects nothing more.  If you really want to thank her with a gift, try to get her a small gift card to a place she frequents or would like to go, but doesn't treat herself.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	First, a handwritten, heartfelt thank you note, in which you specifically talk about what she's done and how much help it was to you, how she has helped to make your wedding day so special, etc.    Next, a nice gift, based on what she might like. Spa gift certificate is usually a safe choice, but also think about her interests. Get her a fabulous clutch if she loves purses, a beautiful crystal bowl or vase if she does a lot of entertaining, etc.|`|LXxxAzIqaa	Write a nice appreciative letter. That always comes from the heart.|`|gRZT4pnUaa	Thank you cards are good. You could take him/her out to dinner or get a gift card to show your appreciation.|`|DqetlSB6aa	A thank you letter and a gift card to Bath and Body Works or since shes into jewelry making and gift card to her favorite craft store.|`|s6stLtvLaa	I would get her a gift when you get your bride's maids gifts.  My husbands aunt did my hair and makeup for my wedding (saving me $700) and she did a great job! She got up at 5 in the morning (she lived 3 hours away from us and pictures were at 10:30) to come and do everything.  I got my bridesmaids these beautiful clear glass Jewelery boxes that had their names and the wedding date engraved on them.  Since she wouldn't accept money I had a box mad for her and gave that along with a thank you card.|`|2VsmOU7zaa	You can get her a really nice card and a gift basket with all sorts of goodies in it. Whatever kind of stuff she likes. Maybe a nice picture frame, candle, stationary, nice cross pen (Cross is a brand that is a very nice ink pen but affordable. You can get them at Staples Office Supply), some sweets, maybe a gift certificate or two. Things like that.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Start with a heartfelt letter thanking her and letter her know what you've told us. Then, something that is lasting, like a charm bracelet with a friendship charm, a photo album of the two of you, a pair of gorgeous earrings, a handmade quilt, something she will cherish from you. You're a great friend thinking of her so highly, I wish you the best of luck!    Good luck!|`|hJk9YZrAaa	Tell her honestly and directly to her face.  You can't get any more real and personal than that.|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	On your wedding day, remembering to take the time to go and spend 5 minutes with her to tell her how wonderful of a friend she has been throughout this process and how much you really appreciated not only her company but her dedication on supporting you all the way through. I think this in itself is going to be amazing, also maybe consider a nice bottle of wine? Or what about a gift certficate to a local restaurant for her and another to use? I dont really think you need to buy them a gift, but if you insist I would go that avenue, think of something she could use to relax, like having dinner be cooked for her, or the wine is so nice!or even a nice spa gift basket with soaps.    Does she have a partner? what if you invited them over for dinner and spend time with them, entertain them for the evening, or just her, or take her to lunch, I think gifts that involve your time mean a lot more then anything you could buy.|`|ujd4RMR7aa	Sexual favours.|`|iuSrMdwmaa	A sincere and heartfelt thank you (in writing) is all that is necessary. Your friend did this for you out of the goodness of her heart and sometimes it is good to allow others to give without trying to match the gift by giving something in return.    But make the thank-you really special by ensuring that she is thanked at the wedding during the speeches, along with everyone else who has helped out in any way.|`|1rpWknAOaa	On your wedding day make sure the photographer gets a good picture of the two of  you together.  You'll be wearing the jewelry she made and it will be a nice keep sake for her.  Also, write her a note expressing how much her friendship means to you.
MMOwlLw3aa	very hard when you break up because you have all this spare time all of a sudden and dont know what to do..  all you can do is see your friends more and keep yourself busy    you never know, u might find that ul miss him when hes gone so maybe just take a break for a while, good luck|`|GfGRj3Y0aa	why is it time to let go?  it seems like that you would be thinking about marriage, depending on your age if you have this kind of relationship.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	its not easy letting go when they have become a part of our lives  so what i suggested was stayin friends and it has help alot...|`|AX4ffdNbaa	I knew it was time to let go when my best friend  finally admitted that he was in love with me.  and had been for a while. It was easier than I thought, because I realized that I was not in love with BF, he had never once said I love you and neither had I ( we were together for over a year) Be honest with him and let him down easy.
0372503bd1f0bf253c8d5a055cc3ae65aa	obviously im a girl but i do know that this happens to a lot of guys. like a lot of them...the only thing i know is if you get the really thin condoms. that seem to help some. and no im not a whore by any means. i just have a lot of guy friends that are kinda open about things...it was an odd conversation.|`|9OVm1hL0aa	Great another person to spread AIDS|`|8V1RT1qWaa	maybe he's straight?|`|ePoSRDlxaa	r u gay with him?|`|emHkDQmaaa	i think he needs a smaller size..|`|lxIPRpzjaa	the size could be wrong or he could be allergic.|`|66l0BPhaaa	it is a mental thing, he rather get and give every and any disease know to man kind.|`|jdah4ZA2aa	A guy told me that he would wear them when he masturbated to get used to the feeling.  Also, try the extra thin, a vibrating ring, or the lambskin ones.  They feel more like "the real thing."  You can also put lube on the inside of them.|`|NWYGazDbaa	i believe he needs a smaller size. the condom may be too big for him if it rolls.

7G4hisdzaa	I would pick out the most God-awful corduroy crap brown tux I could find, and tell him that's what he's wearing.  I think it might sink in then....if not, tell him the dress he choose will look fabulous on him.  Tell him the flower girls will look lovely in the second row.  Tell him the flowers he has found might look a little femine against the bouquet YOU have picked out, and tell him roses are a better look for him.   Stand your ground girl!  I have a fiance that is so eager to pick everything out, I just have to be firm with him.  I will get down to my final two choices and have his input there....  Might not work with him, but my fiance gets it after those sarcastic, always smiling and cheesy remarks.|`|E2X6B1Iaaa	It sounds like you have a very controlling man there. Keep your eyes open-is he always like this? Do you really want to marry someone that tries to control everything and not listen to you?|`|I3V7hE32aa	I would suggest that you stop showing him your ideas and asking for his opinion.  Make the decisions by yourself and that way you'll get what you want.  Call his mother and tell her that you'll take care of the flowers.      However, you should really reconsider this marriage.  Do you really want to be married to someone who is going to control your life?  Marriage is about compromise and it doesn't sound as though you have this in your relationship.  Remember, it's harder to back out once the wedding's over, and this seems like a red flag to me.|`|gRZT4pnUaa	Tell him it's your wedding too. You should be able to pick your own bridesmaids and he should pick out the groomsmen. They should be the people you care about most. As far as the bridesmaids dresses and groomsmen tuxes i think it should be discussed with the whole bridal party not just one person. You should pick your own dress. You are supposed to feel beautiful on your wedding day, not forced into a dress you don't want. Tell him to chill out. Tell him a marriage is 50/50 and the wedding should be too.|`|FnskUYpqaa	It sounds like you have more to worry about than your wedding if he treats you like this all the time. Him and his family taking over like that imaging your life together you might end up with a lot of problems. Put your foot down now! Tell him your twins are going to be the flower girls and that your picking your dress and the colors and if he don't like it take a hike! I can't believe he wouldn't want his 2 daughter in his own wedding. A lot of momma's boys continue going with whatever there mom and sisters tell him to do you need to remind him that he has his own family now and it's you who he needs to listen to if he wants the marriage to work.|`|tBODwcqXaa	Well, the bright side is you have a groom that is actually interested in wedding planning! But you don't need to start off a marriage with him asserting his dominance over everything. This day is about BOTH of you. And it really has little to do with dresses and bouquets... it has to do with starting a life. So he needs to respect your wishes or you need to put your foot down    Have him take this quiz: http://somethingbluebook.com/01/are-you-...|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	I would be very worried about marrying a man that acts like this. Marriage is about compromise. I think you two should definitely go to pre-marital counselling now before you get married... if you decide to get married.|`|q8tUfflyaa	Oh god, my husband had nothing to do with the wedding, so after I planned EVERYTHING he tried to change all these details. Even though I had asked him (do you like this cake? do you like these colors? flowers?) After everything was ordered he said he didn't like them! I lost my damn mind! Not to mention I was 7 months pregnant and hormonal and stressed! Tell him that you need to help plan the wedding, its both your days, not just his. Split it 50/50!     Good luck! And congrats!! In the end, no matter who plans it, your wedding day is amazing! My wedding was supposed to be outside, and we got like 2 feet of rain (in sept 08) the day before and the day of my wedding! Haha even though we had to put a wedding together inside last minute and my dress got mud on it! haha It was still amazing! Enjoy every minute of it!|`|gtunOva2aa	I'm sorry, hun. All you can do is stand your ground. Maybe politely remind him that it's "our" wedding, and not "his" wedding. Try to point out that this special day is meant to celebrate your love and your relationship, not wreck and destroy it. Tell him that you love him, and that he's helping you, but you want more of a say in the planning..  Hope this helps.|`|mvKDbb2uaa	Simply tell him.      You'll have to be incredibly firm and hold your ground on this one.  Wedding planning should be a shared experience and you'll have to let him now how you truly feel about everything.  This wedding doesn't seem like it's yours and tell him that.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	It's nice that he has an opinion but he's taking it too far.    Make a list of five things that are your "non-negotiables" - for example, your dress, your bridesmaids, their dresses (color and style), finding a way to include your daughters, and your bouquet.    This list represents the things that you get to choose, and he doesn't get to complain about them. You pick your own dress and bouquet. You pick your own bridesmaids and their outfits (although you could do a little diplomacy by adding his sister into the bridal party). Remind him that you aren't picking his outfit or his attendants.    And the two of you together need to find a way to include your daughters. Maybe he's right and they are too little to be flower girls - so maybe someone should bring them up to you all during your vows, and say something special about binding the family together. Use your creativity to find a solution that works for both of you.    The rest of it is worth letting go and letting him have his way, since he's so opinionated and micro-managing. But pick your battles and put your foot down for the things you really care about. You have to stand up for yourself.|`|AA11603468	I do not envy you one speck. I'm sorry, but being married is a team effort--you and him together. Any other way leaves someone feeling resentful (you). Why on earth would a cousin's kid take precedence over your own children as flower girls? That makes zero sense.     To be honest, the whole thing has me angry, and I don't even know you. All I know is that would fly with me for about a half second before he learned that type of behavior was unacceptable.|`|E7LQp6VRaa	If you're having this many issues and you haven't even gotten married yet, what do you think the rest of your life is going to be like???    Do you really want to spend your life with someone like that?  A wedding is one day out of your life, what will he be like as a husband?    What man wouldn't want his own children in his wedding???|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Sigh..are you sure he wasn't a woman in a past life? Tell him enough is enough. Put your foot down, and tell him it is your wedding too! Groomzilla indeed.|`|agTCqkLDaa	Even my boyfriend who is very into this stuff said "I know that groomsmen gifts is one of the few and only things the grooms get to do.  It's the bride's day."      I've unfortunately crushed some of his dreams already (just kidding), but if the bride foots the bill then the bride gets to decide.
hNa5oHxQaa	That also means she loves you.|`|IPS3hWweaa	Usually it has the same meaning, but because there's such a large age difference, it may mean something else...|`|Q5FYrU9vaa	YAAAAA|`|EJJMXnf0aa	Its a shy way of saying I love you|`|A3fYo8eYaa	She's too shy to say I love you. Some people say that when they're friends but maybe you could say it to her and she'll say "I love you" back.|`|OuOOy8v3aa	Well it's not really saying it properly, it means she likes you but doesn't want to say it properly at this point.|`|m5uzV6uqaa	Not really..    If she did love you, she wouldn't be afraid to say it..|`|704e5d296085ea43392282942c0cf641aa	Yeah...it is!|`|983e05a65a7b83f487bfd4341ec00ce9aa	It can sometimes people use it as the friendly way to say it like you know in a casual way.|`|QpSgehF8aa	I'm curious how old both of you are.. anyway, maybe she just isn't ready to say the real thing. It really isn't the same.|`|W618lfZ6aa	No! It's not!  Love is a very very strong word and feeling. I feel "Heart" is between "Like" and "Love". It's a good middle ground. If she loved you, she would say so.|`|CEqYjcBeaa	My girlfriend says that to me all the time. She also says I love you. They are generally one in the same thing, the whole "I heart you" thing is typically just the cute way of saying it. At least for my gf it is.|`|W0XoDxJraa	It's not the same. She's avoiding the big "L" word and at the same time trying to get you to think she said it/means it. Ask her to clarify.|`|beUsJNbzaa	well...    heart means love so...    i guess its the the same|`|4OL8VRzNaa	Yes because if u see on some t-shirts for ex. I ? New York = I woud mean  I Love|`|08a48zP9aa	I don't really know but I think there is. lol Like there's a difference between I luv u and I love u. I guess I |`|3VLvEeRUaa	I think it is. The reason why shy may have said "heart" instead of "love" might be because she's a little shy to say it. But, I think it does have the same meaning.|`|ub5gyA46aa	It may be easier to simply ask HER that question. ;)|`|O46f8wl3aa	They are not the same thing at all. "I heart you" simply means she cares about you.|`|mCHSSvw6aa	when she says "I ? You" it's kinda the same thing, but, she shouldn't be ashamed to just say "I love You"|`|8qVkSA4jaa	No. It is not the same. She is afraid to say she LOVES you. I heart you is her way to get out of saying it. When you say you love her, does she say, "I heart you, too."? If so, stop saying you love her until she can say it and mean it.|`|nXSYsQLCaa	i guess so.....|`|4hkM3HXyaa	It could mean I love you OR I like you OR I care about you. It depends on the person saying it. So the best course of action would be to talk to your gf. In my opinion, if she was seriously in love with you, she would come out and say it.|`|67115b1163cc8b9c69bf180fdf940ed7aa	wow 28yrs?? cool and weird.. but nice  ya it's she really really really does like u..  she surely does have strong feelings for u..
JXHwB7Dvaa	The truth will set you free,     But it will imprison your husband.    Your decision.|`|083e9846706988570511a5b3e605f74aaa	ok one u really didnt do anything. u never had any physical interactiong with this guy. but on the other hand you emotionally became involved with this man. i would tell your husband, he has every right. the 1st promise my bf & i did with each other was to never cheat and hunny getting emotionally involved with someone other than your husband or family members (some complete stranger) is cheating. if he gets upset well then so be it your the one that caused it.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	With today's internet, it is easier to fall into that trap than before.  So do not place to much blame on yourself.  You realized your mistake and took corrective measures to stop it.  So instead of hurting your husband, just plan a weekend get away and show him how much you love him and need him.  Good luck.|`|cGGvZqJNaa	If you learned a lesson from it and have moved on, I would keep this a secret.|`|nX1QW5GCaa	You're tearing yourself up over nothing.  You didn't act on this affair - it was just talking.  What would you gain except putting thoughts of doubt in your husband's mind?  Then you'd have 2 people very upset.  Men have mental fantasies about women all the time.  Most times that's all it is - some innocent flirting combined with a wild imagination.   You didn't DO anything wrong.  It's over.  Put it behind you and move on with your life and your husband.  You learned not to play with another kind of fire.  End of story.|`|GeruGGOQaa	Nope.  Somethings are better left unsaid.  Usually when someone has something they want to get off their chest it's to make themselves feel better and get over the guilt and has nothing to do with the other persons feelings whatsoever.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	do your marriage a favor.  keep it inside you.|`|AA11460234	You'd be a fool to mention it.    That is unless you have a strong attraction to orthopedic wards.|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	Telling him will only make you feel better.  Keep the secret is your punishment.  So if you really think cause your husband pain, so you can feel better is the right thing to do, then by all means tell him.|`|IwT8d9ADaa	The only reason you want to tell your husband is to relieve your guilt. YOu know telling him would hurt him. It would be selfish to tell. Stew in your own guilt and let him be.
pRF5LLloaa	LEGALLY, no.    You can't take a decease child as a deduction on your income taxes, and you can't claim a dead child for purposes of welfare.    But otherwise you still remain a parent.|`|wZMq5jqyaa	YES!!! you never stop being a parent! or a spouse if your spouse dies.|`|XX7Z2atQaa	once a parent always a parent....|`|FLv6p7mNaa	Yes|`|O46f8wl3aa	Yes, absolutely|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	yes|`|CZFcH1ykaa	YES|`|6kRhLbs9aa	Yes you are....That would be the same as saying if your child was kidnapped you would not be a parent anymore.|`|7wkHVaNyaa	They are considered a widow, if hubby or wife dies. Yes anyone who looses a child, would still be a parent. I hate your question, sorry but that is a hard question to think about and don't want to , only answered it cause YES they would still be a parent
6gPCA7jHaa	Just go telll people.|`|cPTB57WMaa	You are too young, kid. you better do what she wants, and keep your mouth shut.|`|eIzv9Lwwaa	too young to be talking about love, honestly. anyway, she just doesn't want people talking about it. that is what will happen and they sometimes make fun of you. other than that she is probably embarresed about going out with you or doesnt want to seem taken. i say you leave her.|`|veZLfnGFaa	Tell her you are proud of her and want people to know how much you love her.  :)|`|Dhsyroekaa	if you tell ppl and she doesnt want you to, you may loose her.  Jsut wait and be happy you guys are together      Or maybe she likes you but is afraid/ashamed what her friends will think of you|`|IHz4umhPaa	i used to make out with this girl in my school bus (im 15) and the same thing happened to me. She didnt want me to tell anyone either but i wanted to so i did. Doesnt it make u feel like she's embarrassed about you? its damn frustrating...|`|Zvf6ulXnaa	well being that your in seventh grade let me tell you sweetie she will definately come....and then go. once you hit high school you will have had so many other girlfriends. trust me i grew up fast. BUT i understand living in the moment and seeing her as the only one for you right now. soooo in that case you need to tell her that its your relationship too and you dont want to keep it quite. And if love is the case then tell her that. Or chances are shes already told one of her friends you 2 are together and someone else knows so why not tell one of your friends and when they all start talking blame her. lol. idk its been a while since the seventh grade for me but as far as i can remember you move on quickly and theres always a cuter girl. :)|`|74gPuaXMaa	You're in the 7th grade, there is no point in letting people know. Even when you get older, you don't kiss and tell, ya know.|`|fHHeal1Vaa	you will have to come and get me. no other way. use the email i sent if you want or whatever. but it will be your move. i can lay low for years if you want, i dont mind but I DO NEED TO SEE YOU|`|9sHJz788aa	First of all hun if u r girlfrined doesnt wan to tell anybody maybe she is Ashamed! U should talk to her about it|`|ja1jQBbuaa	talk to her first she'll be P.O.ed if you go off and tell everyone. tell her that it would be easier and would be nice to show some affection durin the day. hope it works out|`|HDCpwKbqaa	In 7th grade, relationships aren't that big of a deal. But if she is really important to you, and telling everyone you know that you are going out with her is what you want, explain that to her, and tell her how much you care about her and love her, which is why you would want to tell people. And if you do tell people, don't make it sound childish or like you are bragging. Just simply come out and say that you two are dating and that you like each other alot. But don't sound corny.|`|Uuo86hdDaa	TELL  her that you peple to know you girlfriend and so girls dont approach me
f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	to get married in the US you will need to contact the city or county offices for where you will be getting married and see if there is a waiting period or any medical tests required (some states still have them) for getting a license.      you'll have to check your local laws to see if there is any additional paperwork you will need to file once you return home.|`|xzJGhhN0aa	You spelled license wrong.     You need to look up the laws for the state you plan to get married in.    But I would advise against marriage.|`|sB27kehMaa	Check with the U.K.'s guidlines on that.  I got married in a different country outside the U.S. and there was some extra paperwork involved, but it all just depends on what your country requires.
2c88J3M7aa	Find someone else who deserves you!  Obviously your old girlfriend was very mean, becuase she probably knew you had plans for her birthday too   Good Luck ?|`|AbQCkNHuaa	Forget her. Karma is a b*tch, she will get it back. And everyone can find some one special. Just have patience. You will find some one.|`|a2HgB81Haa	Even though you love her, I suggest moving on. You deserve better than that. Besides, if she keeps doing that, shes not really that interested.|`|QE2GKQWkaa	Find a girl who is nice and trustworthy, also dont trust too quick!|`|f6OOxJQsaa	Learn English.
b8tqTXFdaa	I would forget about this guy if i were you. He sounds dodgy to me because first he sends you hate mail, and then tells you that you're an "amazing and creative" person? No, that's not the type of guy you should chase after. Plus, you should listen to your parents. I never did, and i regretted it, but i listen now (at least more often :P ) and it pays off well. Overall, i would recommend you leave this person - there are much more better fish in the sea.|`|h3uUzhtiaa	Let him go...|`|QLe4U0baaa	........|.....  ........|..........2 Points..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)  VROOM!!!!!!!!!|`|nI8G21y8aa	i dont think that he takes you seriously. like a kid. theres more than a 10 year age difference. but i guess that dosent matter.  my paarents ar 15 years apart.  i dont know what i'm talking about      best of luck!|`|WChr31Otaa	Move on and start enjoying being 17.  Nothing should bother you in your life now.. you don't need this agrivation.  He is definitely not into you in that way.. and he will never be. Do not be sad though because whatever he saw in you as a friend is probably recognizable to another boy in your life.  Find him and you will have the best of both worlds.|`|3OFwqCL4aa	he called you and appologized because he knew that your parents could press sexual misconduct charges against him and he was trying to keep out of jail! Either bust him or forget about him. My advice just forget about him and move on.
W4C5p8qOaa	She has nothing better to do?  Maybe your activities in the kitchen are the most interesting thing in her life.|`|7be554591e8c040c7b5bfa762a5a2560aa	I would say....she wants to know what food of hers you are getting into.  I would say,  she is the one to decide when to throw away the stuff she has paid for...not you.  You don't know enough to make that decision.  So you are the one who is not minding her own business.    Then,  what you should be doing is studying your spelling.  OR hit the spell check before you put a question out for everyone to read.    When you get your butt out and earn the money to pay for the food you eat.....THEN you can decide what to do w/it.  It is not your place to throw away things that don't belong to you.  Bad enough you are in there eating it all up. There she is out of the goodness of her heart letting you live there and eat her food....and you have the nerve to complain.  What a brat. Get a job and help support your lazy butt.|`|AA11583338	Wow!  Aren't you a little hard on "grandma?"  Basically, first question to you is:  Whose house is it, yours or hers?  Second, could it be that having been a parent (to either your mom or dad) could it just be that she's overly motherly, concerned about healthy eating habits, and then last but not least; let's just say that this is still America, the land of the Free and the brave; which means she can get up and walk around in her house as much as she wants and she also has the right to ask questions as much as she wants.  I think maybe you might want to make sure that there is nothing else going on in your life that makes you so short patient with your grandmother instead of being happy that she's alive and still in your life--and probably will always be in your corner as well....Best wishes
9624d1b569ca710536d56a309ae51f7aaa	There are two choices a child has in becoming an adult.  They can grow and go, or they can go and grow.  Either way, they will eventually have to go.  It is your roll to help them grow as much as possible.Take life's every day challenges as opportunities to help them learn while they are in your care.  While I am not for just letting them run wild, most of our most valuable lesson's come from our mistakes. So practice releasing them (safely) one step at a time.  Talk with them openly and honestly about what choices they made and what they would do differently the next time.|`|htSZsds7aa	Golly, I thought girls still played with dolls at 12. I dont think kids are able to handle the whole dating scene, I hope her dates are just a bunch of friends going out together. I wouldnt allow dating until at least 16 and only then in a controlled environment. As for your 14 yr old, let her get a job babysitting and give her a little rope to explore the world. You can still have restrictions, and as she earns trust let her explore more.|`|pqjJDVxkaa	As long as they keep working each other, it should be fine.|`|X4cg5sksaa	well at the age of 12 pubety hits and well before you know it she will be an adult if you dont let her experiment what life is about and how hard times can be with a boy friend then eating disorders and depession may start talk to her about it say like you can have a boy friend but no touchy touchy with him because u r only 12.    GOOD LUCK!|`|TnhjF7JCaa	Your daughters are growing up. Get over it. But your daughter cant work until she's 15, give more independence, just not too much. Talk to your 12 yr old about relationships and what it means. But you need to calm down about it.
mcywqcHuaa	you should stop treating him like ****. seriously, its annoying.    see you in sociology|`|Gitb3KVDaa	that is so low of you, be a good friend.|`|1fB2UdRHaa	You're not a very good "friend." You should punch yourself in the face until you get a clue. Quit using the word douche in that particular context as well, it makes you sound quite moronic.
BpNSm6sDaa	its sounds kinda of lame but maybe a scrapbook with alot of pics of yall haveing fun together|`|Mi3rHjcYaa	I agree with the 1st person, a Picture Scrapbook is good. Its cheap and very meaningful.     No offense, but I hate when people get me Giftcards because they don't really put any thought into it.
FTjgKbJQaa	damn he's smooth...  start poking him. and try tickling him and say "i want u too"|`|NUeDGVphaa	Yeah, well maybe start joking around with him?  Start poking him and ask him if he's ticklish?  Smile at him and when your in the same room as him maybe try  to make eye contact? :) Give him a hint.|`|JMLzwsFRaa	Give him your number and tell him you need someone to prank call you.|`|18tSHMPpaa	So you can fix it,but I'd hurry.Just tell him you'd like to hear how funny he is when he prank calls and slip him your number.Boys are like puppies...they need to be rewarded,verbally,physically,whatever.Yo... have to let a guy know youre interested or they'll move on.|`|jlojtHPzaa	You didn't blow it,thing is hes feeling kinda rejected but he doesn't want to show it which is why he did the little paper rip thing.Hes just looking for you to let him know that you are interested (genuinely). Things are just kind of weird to you also because you told him no,and later realized you like him, but you don't know if he still likes you.Just poke him and ask if hes ticklish.|`|4V2lk6RDaa	yea I guess you did mess it up,  but here is how u can fix it: u need to show your interested. flirt with him make him know that you really like him. then pass a note with your number. he will call you a whole bunch. then that time will come "wanna be my girlfriend" well not like that. so try it.|`|zAHgZ8qWaa	Cara,    Here's what I think are the answers to your questions, in order:    Did/does he like you? It certainly sounds that way, I remember back in my adolescence that's just how boys would act when they liked a girl - taunting them, etc... it's their version of flirting. Honestly he probably just got to feeling awkward when you said no about giving out your number and wasn't sure if you liked him, so that's why he stopped picking on you so much.    Did you blow it, and can you fix it? I think that you certainly didn't blow it, because this is fixable. If I were your age I would just be brave and tease him a little bit in the same way (as long as it's acceptable and not mean or anything). Then he'll see that you cared enough to pay attention to him and he'll probably start acting normal (I mean, how he was acting before) because he'll feel more comfortable and think that you like him.  If it's okay to give out your number to him, you could even pass him that on a sheet of paper, smile, and make a joke about how you thought about it and realized life must be really dull without anyone to prank call, and then laugh and say you want to see if his prank calls are actually any good!    P.S. Try not to make your parents mad with the prank calls though...    Hope I helped, even a little!
7g8UHUJgaa	with something that overwhelming happening to him, he probably needs some time to gather his thoughts. it might have nothing to do with you.    i remember when i had my first accident in my new car and the first person i called was the person i care most about(my guy friend).     he answered said he could not talk and hung up on me.    i was really really frustrated that he did not even care why i called.    people have personal issues.    i did not talk to him for a while. i needed my space from him.    and yeah a situation like what you have would haunt me too.    but i just think he needs some time.     like i did.    (my accident wasnt even that bad. lol)    when he is ready to talk, then you can apologize. he needs to hear it too probably..    :)|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Yes, you owe him an apology. Put yourself in his place. He was waiting to hear from you and was in the hospital. How would you feel if he did this to you? Don't listen to your friends and no playing games like "hard to get." It always backfires. Apologize. Bring him some homemade chocolate chip cookies. (Not the frozen dough kind either)|`|1hciyvKdaa	The lack of concern showed him a side of you that well most would be shocked to see in you. The intial call you were in a meeting. The second you heard what happend you should of been there, or called to show support and concern.  Is this an internet pal only? Who knows if its even a real thing that happend. LIve and learn|`|PhTKb3JUaa	You waited 4 days?  That's not "playing hard to get" that's playing 'not interested at all."  Sheesh.    Yes, apologize and explain.  If he doesn't answer his phone, start writing it in a text.  He WILL read it if it's in a text at least.|`|U25RAqyoaa	I would maybe try calling him and apologizing. If he doesn't answer leave it on his voicemail. But if you want to salvage the relationship I would def call and apologize the sooner the better. Good luck!|`|OvXqFJzMaa	well... u were at a meeting   BUT u called 4 days later like come on!  u should be like hey im sorry i was just 2 bussy  i mean its really dum 4 him 2 get mad over that|`|MuzqSYjwaa	no appolgy needed.  You have you own life.|`|99qFzxCxaa	well tell him that you were at the meeting?common sense?THINK!|`|QbT6QZYOaa	well if he is your friend you should talk to him, apologize too cause gruges can last a long time. but he should eventually forgive you cause hes you friend, cant stay mad at you forever....    ...i guess depends on how good of friend you are with him too|`|hhL1G3Ofaa	Let him be the one to come around if it happens.  Give him a nice card and write your feelings about the situation.  Good Luck!!!|`|CT1SqLaGaa	look you were friends and just because you wanted to play "hard to get" it probably hurt his feelings its pure stupid yeah you so owe him an apology and explain why. you don't wanna ruin a friendship because you let your hormones get the better of ya. . .|`|VYXh8bRhaa	you probably should especially if you were close  just tell him u wereny able to pick up and how u didn't know what had happened when he called   get him a get well baloon or card or flowers or someting  and no it's not too late!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|zD0lCK5Kaa	You must apologize. Tell him you are so sorry for not calling him. Tell him the real reason why you missed to call him. Be honest and tell him you are really very sorry. I am sure he really need your presence during those moments when he was so downed hearten. If you are feeling guilty poured it out. Go to him and tell him you're sorry. That would be good for you. It will ease the burden in your heart. You will feel better if you would visit him as soon as possible.|`|AyPOc8WNaa	You need to apologize and you should have listen to your feelings when this first started.  Apology on the phone, computer, or texting won't work, you need to do this face to face.  If you don't apologize it wil be the end of anything that you two had.|`|2iDvyoXhaa	I don't know why people insist on playing silly games. If you wanted to talk to him, you should've just called...but I'm sure you know that know.    Try calling him and explaining how you feel and apologize for not getting back to him sooner.|`|mxosTJv5aa	just apoligize|`|FiEZabssaa	that was the time you should be there for him to show how much you really care about him. friends arent allways right. im sorry to be rude but i think you totally fu**ed up. apologizing would deffinatly be the right thing to do. tell him the truth, about how you feel and how youre friend told you to play hard to get. and how you wanted to talk, but you didnt pick up the phone because of bad advice. tell him what you are telling us.|`|9uhiCmueaa	i don't know.  You can apoligize if you want...  but you didn't know.  and its not your fault...  i think that's your desicion.  if he was a real friend.. or anything...  he would've talked to you or called you back  or something.  i dont know.|`|5vGmSK0qaa	try calling him to ask how his injuries are doing. mention that you were concerned and that you care. if he asks why you didnt call back right away, you could always say you figured he needed some time to rest and heal and that he would call when he was ready. if he is still mad after this, maybe you could try apologizing, but if he wants to stop talking to you after you didnt call him back only once, maybe he isnt worth your time.|`|80dXyJ6Jaa	I think that you should've apologized. Try to talk to him and show him that you feel remorse and have a talk with him. He should be a real friend and be willing to forgive. If he doesn't, pray for him and let it go.|`|vS3L1gadaa	Hm, maybe you should send him a text expressing your real concern and also apologize for not calling back asap. If her was a real friend, he would understand and forgive you eventually but some things take time. I know that if my friends acted like they didn't care for me especially if I came close to death, I would be really hurt and demand an explanation from them, especially if they were close to me.   It seems like you're playing 'hard to get' with this guy and a few 'mind games'. Trust me, from personal experience, these little 'games' never work, what it does is push him further away from you. I know what it's like; I actually played 'hard to get' with a boy I liked and he thought I hated him and just gave up. Be the bigger person, apologize and perhaps confess to him before its too late, you don't want a good friendship down the drain.
yOsEeTUnaa	In my opinion, if you are sleeping together, you should be able to talk to each other, openly and candidly without feeling weird about it! None-the-less, it is really not like you are chasing him...just call and make it very non-chalant. Just say that you were just making sure that he got your new ph  because you could not remember if you sent him the new one or not.
xGshAiXOaa	You can let the man into your bed, but you worry about calling him?      This is Marriage & Divorce.  And I don't know anyone named Tricy.|`|yynC47EMaa	Just walk away.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	call once then leave it to him to call back.|`|obXAeNW5aa	i would call him and leave the   on his phone who knows he may not have gotten the new  |`|AA12069899	give it one more shot|`|2nwjse6naa	Call him, some guys are sensitive in that area. If he don't have a job he may feel reluctant about even being in a relationship. Maybe he's thinking your not interested in him. If someone brought the flame you both have to feed the fire... Hopefully he's not involved with another. But welcome to wide world of love...|`|ivsYJPx3aa	nah,, you gotta let him chase you and yeah ...you should of went .. The price of his is his to win....  This is where you don't say what you want so bad to say ..... Could she be waiting on his blessings to hit that open road?..  Baby get ready .. ...get set ... Don't you know .... I know......|`|vwvYhWrLaa	Uh...No, no, and hell no!  And stop laying down with just anyone.  Of course he was "affectionate after wards" with you, you'd just given him temporary satisfaction.  It seems your self esteem & self-worth is very low, you should get counseling.  Don't you see [in the news] what's happening to women like yourself; who do what you are doing?  They're losing their lives at the hands of psychopaths and serial killers....that you may have slept with!  You're sleeping with men you don't even know.  As for him not being able to look you in the eyes, that's common of men who are lying/cheating.  He's either already serious with some1 else, or married.  In either case, he owes you nothing since you're not in a "committed" relationship, but a "free" one.      Changing your number was just a start, now change your ways.
BPtnDLu3aa	Uh, this is a little stereotypical. Lots of Asians dress like this, not just Japanese women. In countries like Taiwan, Japan, and Korea..it's common to dress cute. So what if SOME Americans wear jeans? It's b/s if you say that most American girls don't care about being cute and sexy. In fact, Americans are more infatuated with breasts and buttocks than most other countries and obviously, that's because it's more exposed and publicized in America. There's nothing wrong with the way Japanese women dress or any women that wear clothes to feel cute or sexy. It's our right and guys can think what they want...good for them.    Stop stereotyping...you're coming off as a very ignorant individual.    Just because we're girls and guys may think perverted thoughts doesn't mean we should restrict ourselves and cover up everything. Tch.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Maybe Japanese girls don't think that getting attention from guys is "disrespectful".|`|IMjLBzlPaa	HEY WHERE DID U SEE THESE JAPANESE GIRLS WITH SHORT SKIRTS????|`|QNE6c77yaa	I worked in Japan and that's the way they dress. They're all very slim and they love fashion.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	Because they have such smooth skin and well formed legs.|`|tRhRjYsLaa	American girls do wear miniskirts also just not in the winter time unless they are trying to hard. The Japanese women might not know our culture over here and America or they can be trying to hard as well. Because they dress like that over there in Japan.|`|iMeh9lMbaa	it's the sensation of FREEDOM  i guess they don't get freedom in their own country.   in fact eastern countries r very dogmatic & orthodox in their beliefs.|`|jsMJ4d8jaa	I would have to strongly agree with you. There are a lot of perverts out there and when they see a person from a foreign country who has never been to America they take advantage of the situation because they know that the person is vulnerable . That is when that person may be at a higher risk of getting raped. Being new to a country and dressing skimpy.
VSVQHKwKaa	A lot of this has to do with being 17 and a teenager.    However, it is not an excuse to treat others badly. Just because you're feeling angry or rotten, doesn't give you license to be a witch to everyone around you.    So, realize that you are in a transition period, accept it, relish it, and focus on making everyone around you glad for your company.    You'll find that, when you do this, your rotten feelings diminish.    Good Luck!|`|OG4410bdaa	that sounds like me my first month or so of my pregnancy  the hormonal change of concieving a child is almost immediate...  if there's any chance you could be pregnant then I'd take a test    if that isn't it then there are other reasons  mostly sounds like a hormonal imbalance...  are you PMSing?  are you suffering from depression?  stressed out?    (no shame in being depressed- most Americans go on antidepressants at some point in their life, and the need to use them is generally temporary)    in any case I'd def talk to your doctor about it asap    to opetke:  this is not normal teenage behavior  yes, it is normal for a teenager to have mood swings or to be irritable, that is part of the age and the transition stage in life  but crying for hours and then feeling fine is NOT a normal, typical mood swing  it could easily be a very serious sign of some very serious medical conditions and to tell this young girl what she is feeling is ok is very wrong and very dangerous of you!|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	It could be hormonal; but I'd ask you to visit your doctor nonetheless.     Perhaps there is something wrong, and if this is the case, the sooner you find out, the better.     Sometimes disorders like bipolarity or being depressed can make you act this way. So please get one or two doctors' opinions soon. Meds exist precisely because a lot of us need help. Do not ignore this situation.    Good luck.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	there is something defenitly  not making your happy.. i went through this and many people go through it too..its called depression.. try talking to a close friend u can trust.. or try getting some professional help .. talk to your conselor that might help.. ur not alone.. good luck|`|AA11180444	You might have a condition more commonly known as severe PMS.  Seek medical help.  There is a drug that they can give you for it that you take only for a week.  It really does work!
0s93q8Ocaa	Listen to your instinct.  You know this guy has tons of baggage.  TON!!    He will always have these issues in his life.  ALWAYS.    Give yourself a break from the relationship.  Give yourself some time to think about this relationship.  Ask yourself if you're willing to live with his issues...not just for now, nor a year from now, but when times are really bad.|`|A7lghafHaa	oh my god! your fight or flight instinct is right on  its time to move on and find yourself someone who is not a contestant for jerry springer  you deserve so much better!|`|7ewzmiNEaa	what is the value in staying with him  Too much baggage? YES!!!  Do you want to continue with it?  Your choice.|`|ifC1aFHxaa	You, I think, really answered your own question when you said, "...as if he is one of my children". D'oh.  Everyone does, indeed, have baggage. Look at the story of the woman caught in adultery. Jesus said to the gathered crowd, ready to kill this woman for violating the law, "The one who is without sin, let him throw the first stone." The Bible says that one by one people started leaving, starting with the oldest - the ones with the most mileage have the most baggage.  It isn't the baggage, my dear, it's how you carry it.  He isn't carrying it well and you know it.  This guy needs time to get his life straightened out: his business fixed, his marriage ended, his paternity tested, his personal finances put in order, and YOU not to be carrying him.  Feel free (even obligated) to have him involved in his new daughter's life, but at least at first from a different position than as your bf.|`|AA11580836	To make it short and sweet, if the answer to is it all worth it in the end is yes then that is your answer. If you believe he is not worth it then the answer is no, just take some good time to think long and hard about it, but it all depends on what you really want.|`|7tibLPi2aa	You could probably get so much better in you life. So you shouldn't let him weigh you down.
26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	No that is not legal.|`|AA11603468	No, you cannot. Only as a game, but not in reality.|`|fHHeal1Vaa	oh shut up. i married you a few times already and divorced you and annulled the marriage for the reason of deception and hiding your identity. right now, the marriage is annulled and it will remain so till further notice.|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	Oh God I hope this actually doesn't become popular sometime in the future. How sad.  I think it's a bad idea, BUT I suppose for a business class it is feasible. I'm pretty sure that you can sign government forms online, but not (yet?) marriage forms.|`|8g51eBf1aa	No it's complicated. What if the sound doesn't work? What if your computer crashes? Too many what if's. And why would you want to? The wedding day is supposed to be the most important day of your life!|`|j5Zm7Rndaa	ya if urnt willing to fly over there to see your man (or woman) than you clearly dont love them enough to marry them.
26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Good luck!|`|yhgRaBPXaa	Good luck! Sounds like a lot of fun...Halloween is my favorite!|`|SMyb2I2daa	awww good luck :]|`|I2zjRPS0aa	@babykitty you didn't even come close to answering this question.
p7pqywxLaa	Depends.  My mum says she sees people of that age like sons, although she can think they're attractive, she's dignified enough to never make a move.|`|jdah4ZA2aa	I'm not that age yet, but I can imagine there are some women who would and some who wouldn't.     Of course, some college age men are physically attractive.  Some may look too young, but others are looking mature enough to not look like babies. HOWEVER, not all women will go for sheer visual attraction.  The maturity level might make her not at all interested in him because of the emotional/social aspect of being with someone that much younger.|`|81945OXUaa	Yea.The reson is because younger guys have more energy than guys their age.So they can enjoy it more.I personally like MILFS from 35-50.Ofcourse I also like women my age too.
wf53TiSpaa	start acting like her and give her a taste of her own medicine|`|X2cApvrcaa	Maybe your friends are not the friends you thought you had.  You should talk to them casually about it and see what their take is.|`|yOsEeTUnaa	Why not just ask her why she is bossy or arrogant? Maybe it will make her think twice and change and maybe she will be mad...but at least she cannot be mad that you are talking about her behind her back!|`|6hDnMQpoaa	Just be nice and consider others feelings just as important as yours, in life it's one of the more important things.|`|AA11583338	Whoa!  Are you kidding?  You guys know what you need to do and you're taking the first step right here.  How about you and your friend who are able to see through this female asking her if the three of you could do lunch so that you can all talk.  Then during the luncheon I would each take turns to let her know why you called the lunch and then be as honest with her about your feelings as possible--also remember that honesty without compassion is hostility.  I would also let her know that our friendships are built on and around trust, honesty, compassion, and understanding.  I would point out that you feel that she is a manipulator who is not allowing her true character to come out and also point out that you also see her short changing herself by people pleasing.  Most times when you point out a person's good points, they are more willing to be open minded when you offer constructive criticism.  One of two things will happen as a result of you and your friend talking with her, either she'll improve or she won't and you and your friend can choose not to associate with her.  However, make sure you two are not judging her as nobody is perfect and none of us can afford to judge anyone else.|`|beZfeSBPaa	If there is a group of you within the group that are getting fed up, it is best to stick together in this situation. This person is probably quite insecure, even if that sounds strange, and wants her friends to have the same views on things as herself. Some people deal with this insecurity by changing their own views but she has obviously decided to change yours, if that's the reason she's doing it. Also, the person changing for her is probably either somewhat afraid of her or just doesn't want to lose her friendship. If I were you I would make it obvious that it aggravates you and don't let her win when she tries to 'brainwash' you. In other words, be yourselves. If she doesn't realise what she is doing to you or just doesn't want to stop the only solution I can think of is to let her go. Don't just use this advice though because i'm sure there is a better way somewhere out there!|`|QE2GKQWkaa	Tell her that she should slow down.|`|iT0Z2icCaa	seems this girl is a serial attention seeker , at heart she maybe a genuine nice girl , she maynot be a happy person within , i also suspect that if she was confronted about her attitude she wuld melt or burst into tears . so before you judge her and condem her to your friends . give her a chance to come clean . naturaly you should choose a time to catch her alone she will be more vunerable and will be more honest with you than she would be in the company of [her so called ] friends. good luck .|`|B3VYy8sFaa	ahhh to have "high school" problems again.|`|505kdpepaa	Miaow.    Lump it! That's all. x|`|TRZmtO2waa	just gradually leave the group in time, and you and your best friend just be best friends, its easier than having 6 "best" friends.|`|puOTqIBUaa	The next time your group is together and the girl is bossy,childish,etc.,  call her out on it. If she's being bossy, just say something like"Do you know you always act like our mother, whats up with that?" If you do this in front of everyone it will show that you are strong and that you are not intimidated by her. Plus it gives your other friends a chance to agree with you.
IE9NfLGoaa	Wear A Cup|`|dI1umvklaa	Kick them all back, then have a big orgy! Works for me. Pain and love go together hand in hand|`|vKYdV5r2aa	Tell her the next time she kicks you that you are going to MAKE her KISS IT and make it feel better !!!!!!!|`|2b0f81fb7bceab4ca7447b2b2061c7dbaa	A kick in the c***.  And then tell her how you feel every time she kicks you in the nuts.|`|983a3a8efe5cb244e13ce535ec318f27aa	I personally have no idea how a women would actually physically be able to kick me repeatedly in the nuts if I knew that they might try it and I didn't want it to happen.    Sounds like castration is the best option for you. Not only will it stop you having painful balls, but it will spare the world from the suffering caused by you having any children who would no doubt end up as p*ssy-whipped as yourself.|`|fCXuNGHraa	Get a crotch guard.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Kick them in their nuts.    I'm truely sorry for your crotch.|`|nqylxY7Gaa	Um what is she 5?! There is a maturity problem with that. Tell her to stop because it actully hurts. Show her you actually mean it and it is starting to upset you. And honestly you should be with someone who doesn't act like they should be in the first grade.|`|IEQqdYO2aa	tell her not to, simple|`|AbQCkNHuaa	Just ask her to politely stop. If she is doing it for no reason then you need to have a serious talk with her. But talk it out, she should stop.|`|LAbQy9d4aa	Armor|`|kyUiaDgyaa	Well keep your legs closed and don't give her the opportunity|`|gXldpzCFaa	**** punt her alot to see how she feels and then have alittle make up sex and the there you go     p.s. i fell sorry for you  \|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Bow down and appreciate the kicking.  If you obey her demands, maybe she will cut you some slack.|`|gD2wimkvaa	put a steel casing around your nuts. the next time she kicks you is will hurt. or you could tell her how it makes you feel.
d0WK1j47aa	haha, sounds like me and my friends... you poor guy :)|`|ZR34thBvaa	Beat them.|`|A3fYo8eYaa	No it's not right for them to do it. I'm sure it hurts!  No but talk to them and tell them to grow up, you'll be just as bad as them otherwise and guys dont hit girls.  Yes Of course, They're your friends. But as I said tell them to grow up. You could humiliate the girls if you could.  No not that I know of. Them girls aren't normal..they need help.|`|m5uzV6uqaa	They do it because it's funny and entertaining. Guys can be jerks at times so they were damn right to do that!    I kneed my ex in the crotch... i couldn't stop laughing!|`|rKsgGHKkaa	lol get some other girls to go punch them in the box!  cuz it would b weird if guys punched them in the box but ya. then after that happens to them go up and b lyk   ya that effin hurts dsnt it!|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Hooray for the girls.  They get even for the humilitaing ways that you treat them.|`|Odu5lIuBaa	HELL NO ITS NOT OK!!! if you didnt do anything to deserve it it shouldnt be done,protect your self and your friends and get them back,just make sure you dont get in trouble and its not too harsh|`|5d5t1Rpeaa	punch them in the face|`|3zd5Zd0laa	Next time they do that, you have the LEGAL right to punch them in the face!|`|AA11105856	Yeah that's not right im a girl but i bet it hurts you guys if they do it again or come close to doing it grab them real quick by the arm or something and firming tell them to never do that again. If it keeps going you need o tell somebody and get them in trouble that's crappy if i was your big sister i would go talk to those little girls and give them a piece of my mind|`|GfCRiueRaa	1. Of course not. :\  2. No, then you'll just be as bad as they are.  3. Of course. They're your friends aren't they?   4. No and I don't know anyone who does.    Wait until one of them gets sued. That'll be funny. hahaha.|`|bTGWxf6raa	That's actually really nasty. Its not right for them to do it if they have no reason.   I don't suppose there is a way you can get them back because if you hit a girl you'll get called a poof...:S  Yeah I would stand up for my friends.   Well this boy used to go round punching girls in the chest area but he eventually got bored of it and moved on.    Good luck. (: x|`|cVwcX9amaa	1. no it's not right, even tho they kneed you...  2. maybe but not through violence  3. yeah  4. no...    best course of action...tell everyone to ignore them and start wearing a cup..lol|`|tjhOH6igaa	wear a cup :)  it will hurt them not you  1 no its yours, unless you are bein a complete dick  2 nope you would be just as bad as them  3 yes   4 no i dont want to ruin a guys junk :)|`|nXSYsQLCaa	no it's not right, they shouldn't do that. at all it's wrong   yes b/c that if it was them then they wouldn't want anyone do anything like that to them.   no protect yourself and run!!!!!!!!!! how come you don't go and talk to someone about them doing that to them.  not that i know of i don't i may flirt with them or whatever but never hit them where it hurts unless they do something wrong to me.|`|mCHSSvw6aa	NO, it is definitely not ok. when some one does that to you, it is the same thing as abuse, well, it is abuse. it is right to protect yourself and your friends, but getting back at them would just bring you down the their level. if this does happen again, it would be ok to firmly grasp one of their arms and in VERY clear terms, tell them to stop.|`|hY27X4XCaa	Give them a spanken
gw88BKXyaa	dude the best way to ask her is face to face, she will be sooooo happy and she will think its cute dont ask via text, or msn, or facebook, myspace you get the picture, just be straightforward and express your feelings toward her...good luck my friend =)|`|NWEJdpocaa	if you can't do it to her face, then text her, call her, im her, just ask her out. she already showed that she's interested, so do it!|`|GxSnVRAOaa	She already gave you her number...you're in the door.  Just go out with her and see where it goes.  If you like her, tell her...obviously she likes you too.|`|EvDoLydgaa	I dont knoww  Im shy too|`|aaQUMXUzaa	Max, I'm shy myself. believe me, I missed a lot of opportunities because of my shyness. But look, she has already gave you her phone number, she's waiting on you to ask. She is not going to say no at this stage.  Make it simple, just ask her if she would like to go for a movie or something like that.  Best of luck.|`|KHic5rAaaa	Hey, who says you have to actually tell her that you like her?!  Actions speak louder than words!  Just start talking to her more and ask her to go see a movie/mall with you.  You don't ever have to say the words, "I like you" or "Will you be my girlfriend" if you continously hang out/talk to her.  Eventually with time, it'll definitely develop into something more than a friendship.  Keep it cool and casual for now.  Just talk to her on the phone and ask her to come over/ go somewhere with you.  You don't have to make it awkward or anything by saying I like you...obviously she'll know you like her if you're always talking/hanging out with her.    Good luck!|`|LeE75SF9aa	I think that saying yes to going out with her is the first way to do it.  From there it will all happen naturally.      But in the meantime...give her attention, compliment her, talk to her and LISTEN|`|qEH9dbT9aa	use the number. she's giving you a free pass!|`|WcMDAlE7aa	How will you date her if you can't talk face to face with her?|`|yEnEMuhtaa	If your scared to tell her face to face then tell her by texting.. its a little lame to ask her by text, but since your shy just ask her by texting..  =)  good luck|`|oHNacSRxaa	Obama is our president..anything is possible..go ahead ask her!!...gotta have confidence and HOPE|`|ipo4WKw6aa	Ask her out via text.

vjmXiIfnaa	Not so much cheating, I'd say he just isn't into you anymore.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Sounds like he avoiding you... talk to him he might be over|`|ouXbJLbOaa	no thats not signs of cheating. thats just sighns that hes annoyed that ur calling him or texting him so much, or hes just not that into you anymore.|`|9alN3sCTaa	doesnt matter. the question is do YOU still want him even though he acts like this?|`|40qTdKuPaa	Talking is the best way to get answers. You have to ask him straight up, and go with your gut feeling if you feel like hes lying or he is cheating. Your gut feeling is always right. Dump him if you have too, its okay, because there are so many people in this world who will date you and like you for you! hope this helps.|`|4b26cb1a8069288001778a663299498baa	Confront him. Some females can have a very good sense of knowing when a guy could or is cheating on us. If he gets all defensive there is that high possibility that he is. I know my bf did the same exact thing to me. He got defensive and then i broke up with him. Two hours later he admitted that he did cheat on me.|`|DQLe07X1aa	no.  r u insane.  your clingy!!!!!!!!!!!|`|JyvG8dFcaa	read the book " he's just not that into me" or something like that...it will answer questions like this...good luck!|`|N5q1osbCaa	Don't jump to conclusions! You've only been together for 5 months, he might be busy at the times you text or call him. It doesn't mean he's cheating it means you need to give him a little space. If you text him and he doesn't text you back then that means he's probably busy, not cheating though. Give it an hour and then call him, if he doesn't answer leave a voice mail if you wish and just be nice and tell him you miss him.    "When confronted with an opponent, conquer him with love."  All you can do is trust him, and if you can't help but keep thinking he's doing these things then maybe you shouldn't be with him.    Good Luck|`|xu0HiYEOaa	that doesn't mean he is cheating, he could be fed up with you calling or texting him everyday. sometimes men needs their space from serious relationships.|`|8KGJj67aaa	Honey it could mean he's just not so interested in you.     It's not proof of cheating, but he may just be distracted. Talk to him about it.    He may not confess if he is cheating, but it will give you insight into what he's thinking.|`|fl5LSbxVaa	Girl, there is only two explanatons, one, hes cheating, and two, hes not interested in you anymore. Ask him if hes cheating, if he says no, still go on and do some investegating. What him, and check his cell phone. Some man think they are slick, but you have be a top detective. TRUST ME, been there so many times before.
tX2giFynaa	If you know mathematics, you can find your answer. See...    Equation first : 1 is single 1 ( one digit )    Equation second :1 + 1 ( two digits and function is add + ) = 2    in first equation it was one  in other equation that one had converted in two by adding one more.  it means before you were single and buy one Burger, now (after wedding)  you'll purchase two burger.    I am not married, but I know after wedding you will be in heaven.    Wish You A Happy Wedding Life.|`|Fj4FjEpaaa	life is totally different when you get married.it's just not about you're self anymore.it's about some one else.what ever you do should be for you're partner.you have to be self-less not selfish !   that's what makes a couple closer to each other.  honestly marriage life is sweet & not as bad as they say it is.  good luck.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	It really depends you have a joint account, consult one another for any large purchases, take vacations together, if you do it right you will have a companion and security for life.|`|cGGvZqJNaa	Every day will be the same when you marry.

He is getting a divorce in the movie and does not think he wants to try to stay with his wife.  He realizes in a short period of time that being alone is painful.  He says that "when he was married and he was sad he was only 1/2 as sad, and when he was happy he was twice as happy.

1TPGdaXJaa	"Economy?" of kids?.    What is an economy of kids? Like black market babies for sale? It is stupid because they fluctuate in value so much that it is hard for the market to stabilize? and the ethical implications are demoralizing?|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Because they have parents who can't spell words like economy and know yet still post questions of little understanding on the internet.|`|AA11460234	This is precious.

AA11817078	this is how liking somebody goes:-  1) The richness with words, which you have, you have written very clear and short.  2) Dressing sense  3) Caring and loving as you said you are shy and self kind so definitely you will care whom you get   4) passion which you have to show hope you will    so I am into you|`|NKeoYo2Baa	personality wise yes.   but unfortunately thats only one piece of the puzzle.  there has to be a sexual attraction from both sides or you will not be getting far.   theres personality and chemistry. great relationships have both going both ways.   any imbalance is asking for trouble.
bELCxTXfaa	Hi, I agree, its rather odd for her to talk to random people like that, I don't know her age but if she's young (like teen), its just a timely thing, she'll get over it. Maybe she needs someone to talk to more often, maybe she feels lonely at times. Try to hangout with her and spend much time together. Take her to mall, movies whatever, also you could introduce her to some of your other friends. This way she would hang out with people who you trust, rather than those online. Anyway, if she still doesn't stop, you have to remind her constantly that this is wrong. Eventually you might have to tell her to stop this attitude. First things might get a little bad, but eventually (if she really not that foolish) she will understand.|`|7be554591e8c040c7b5bfa762a5a2560aa	Talking won't hurt anything....but if she tells them where she is..that is another story.  Tell her not to give out personal info like her address...ph no....stuff like that. What does it matter how old they are?|`|77Ng0HT8aa	I've totally been here before with a friend and there's no nice way to say it. You just have to tell her it's not normal or safe for that matter. She will hate you for a bit and will have to realize it on her own but it's what you have to do as a friend and look out for her.|`|sWIDnaKDaa	the best way to tell her is that she needs to stop because it is unsafe and you are just concerned bout their safty and it is dangerous talking to people you dont know on the internet cuz they can get info out of you and track down the computer and it can end up very badly...just sit down and talk to them bout it and aware them of the dangers    hope i helped
2c88J3M7aa	Listen to a song that you think is meaningful and you can relate your relstionship to. Send it to him, and ask him what he thinks about it like about the lyrics and stuff, if he likes it then just say "Do you want this to be our song?" That's what my ex did with me and I thought it was cuutee :)|`|kw1u0kjjaa	You cant 'choose' a song out of the blue. It just has to happen to where it both affects you, the lyrics describe your relationship at the time, etc.  My songs with my man are 3 doors Down "Here without you", because he's been deployed to Iraq 6 times and it has definitely affected our relationship, and Nickelback's "Far away", which he dedicated to me, and says exactly how he feels.|`|d861778018432f5f26321e9fa06ec7faaa	get the same ringtone as him and a song that came out when u first met.

Or sing first, and look at him weirdly; he'll ask why, and you tell him that's his que to sing.  If that don't work, wait until he is sleeping, and play a loud sound, that will make his ears ring, tell him to sing to end it.  Or when he hic-ups, tell him that singing will get rid of it.  Still no solution, get an album and play it till he learns the words, and then start singing when it is off.  Or try another take, everytime he sings, you STOP doing something annoying.  Or when he sings, reward him with a cookie, or any treat he prefers.  Repeat until all he does is sing all day.     Why on earth do you want to hear him sing?  Really.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	look for a song that makes you think of him .     personally, my favorite is "inevitable" by anberlin   and i like anything gavin degraw .    good luck:)|`|aUTLstpAaa	Ask him if there's any songs that makes him think of you?

ifC1aFHxaa	1. 6:18 pm Eastern Standard Time  2. Boys are shallow because you assume they are. Any population group is as nuanced and varied and different as you look for. All cows look alike, except to another cow.   3. I think it should be legalized as it is no more dangerous than cigarettes plus alcohol and those are legal, but since they are not legal (yet) you should tread very carefully, since most drug laws treat weed as just as dangerous as cocaine or meth. Get caught with this drug and it'll screw up your life just as bad as if you got caught with coke.|`|AA12135516	1. No idea.  2. Not all boys are shallow.  3.

iPNOVR6Gaa	Yes, watch Super Nanny.  She has a technique that involves putting your child into his bed no matter how many times he gets up, even if it's literally a hundred times.  You have to fight this battle for a couple of nights, but once they're trained, they're trained.    I never had to use her method myself, because I have this thing called authority.  My children understood when I was firm and clear with them, even at your son's age.|`|yynC47EMaa	It's called strength, that's it. Not goign to sugar coat it or add all kinds of complicated theories to it. Either you are a strong parent or a weak one, that's really all it is.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	the first time he gets in your bed at time take him back to his bed and tell him its time to go to sleep. after that each time he gets up just place him in his own bed and do not say a word. keep at it until he stay in his bed. the firsst few nights will be difficult butyou jsut have to be strong and after a few days it will pay off.|`|obXAeNW5aa	you must keep putting him back in his own bed trust me he will soon get the idea but you must be consist with it and that is the problem most parents give up way to soon .when you put him back in his own bed don't say anything just do it it might take several days or one night but if your consist he will soon realize that he must stay in own bed|`|vm1Fj2AVaa	Let him sleep with you. He doesn't understand why his dad isn't there anymore and I think at that age they aren't sure if you might be gone too tomorrow, so they need your attention.|`|3eac4095162a8fc3b0c7ab465f41b17daa	Hanginit got it right.    Your son is confused why his Dad is not there. And is afraid if he falls asleep you will be gone too.  Don't get angry with him, but while you are putting him into bed (after he went to the potty one last time) rub his back and tell him how great he is, and how tomorrow morning after ya' all wake up you'll eat this for breakfast, and that , and then you both will do this..    From the sounds of it, I think you'll be in that living situation for a while.  Don't stress yourself, be thank-full of your Mother.    And get on with that divorce proceeding and file for child support all ready.  You should have been allowed to stay in the house/ or your living arrangements where you were before with your hubby, while he paid the bills and lived elsewhere.    Divorce lawyers will allow clients to bill the other spouse. Especially in divorce hearings.    There is nothing wrong with children wanting to be cuddled and reassured that the parent will still be there in the morning.|`|cmdsvO5saa	The secret to success is repetition and consistency.  Take your son to his bed and explain that it is time to sleep.  Try reading a story or two before bedtime every night so that he'll learn to associate it as a time to get ready for bed.  It will help him transition from play time to bed time in his head.  Lay him down, tuck him in and say goodnight.  If he cries let him, it won't kill him even though sometimes it sounds like that exactly what you're doing :)  If he gets up explain to him again that it is time to sleep and put him back in his bed and start all over.  After the 3rd time he gets up don't explain to him anymore, simply take him back to his bed and tuck him in.  A friend of mine told me that it worked great for her (after 2 nights). It took me about 15 to 30 trips to her bed each night but six nights and many tears later (not all of them hers) it worked.  Just hold your cool and don't get frustrated and don't give in, you'll just have to start the entire process all over again.  Good luck.

oGoWz511aa	She's doing it because she's shocked.  She was probably expecting you to put up a fight, but you're just letting it go.  And you should.  9 months is long enough to know whether you're in a relationship that might last.  She didn't feel that way.  Of course, you might have sent her for a loop by not arguing.      It's hard to say what it means.  It could mean she's sorry she broke up with you.  Could be she wants to try breaking up again to see if she can make you cry.  Might just be that the guy she dumped you for, dumped her, and you're the fall back guy..|`|74aZAQmMaa	She wants you to be her emotional tampon, trust me.

That should fix her little using as*!!!!!!|`|LVlS4y7Caa	Be wary of the begining of the "jerk around" you know, where she jerks your 'chain' back and forth for the NEXT 6 months?  You need to to tell her flat out if she call's..."you ended it, I told you how I felt about friendship, now let's just formally end it with this conversation, please don't call or contact me again".  That is what we call fair play...    Oh you can be a patsy and allow her to waltz in and out of your life, but it would equate to torture for you, and wholly idiotic on her part, if not just plain selfish and mean.    Take the 'bull by the horns" and let the final words be just that - the final words.    Sincerely,    Grace|`|7tAH3GEBaa	I'm sure what you had text her was what she trully wanted, she woke up this morning and realized that it was about to come true. It probably hit her and she got scared of the change and wondered if this was what she really wanted. All girls like the attention and the feeling of want. Now you so called don't want her anymore. Its a hard blow. Dont give in. Remind her of what was said and move on. You wont be doing anybody any favors by playing her game. Plus you dont want someone who doesnt want you or has had recent feeling that she didnt want you.|`|yEnEMuhtaa	shes obviously missing you..

She will never want to be in a relationship with you but she may use you for emotional support, free drinks, rides, money, someone to talk to when her new boyfriend upsets her, etc....    Tell this girl to get lost (even though it hurt you).  She will just use you and lead you on but I guarantee you won't get anything from her except heartache and confusion.    Tell her it's over and to get lost because you're interested in someone else.  The end.  You can't remain friends.  Period.|`|9oMPhoTAaa	You obviously don't want to talk to her.

However if you are engaged to this guy you must love him.  You should go to couples therapy.  Make sure you have really discussed the issues.  There are some great books 101 or 1001 questions to ask before you get married.  You two should go through that to make sure you have similar opinions on the important issues.    Three times means he is not marrying the wrong type of woman but that he is the wrong type of husband.  Find out why.  It could be very important to deciding if this marriage will last or not.|`|0Id85yiYaa	that's up to you to decide|`|sGP6s7uraa	Here's what my family says about marriage (and they have a poor track record):    1st times for love  2nd times for money  3rd time your insane    LOL...Just kidding.

You guys may need to do some premarital counseling so you two can figure out if you're right for one another.|`|kHEFi3ttaa	You're more likely to divorce with the more divorces you have under your belt. I'd personally run for the hills but hey that's just me.|`|sMUiGFPraa	Go through premarital counseling. Ask him if he has ever done that. Maybe that's the missing link. If you are both emotionally healthy and truly in love it doesn't matter about past relationships.

I think that if you look at your fiance, you are looking at a specimen of guy type  2 in the article.  Take a good hard look at how he treated his other three wives, because that's a preview of what's coming for you.  The surest predictor of how people are going to behave in the future is the way they've behaved in the past.|`|mfbKe04Xaa	i agree with you..three times..they may not have been the problem..he might be...I am not sure if you should exactly leave him though...If he's good to you then try it out...|`|WrUTuQdlaa	Run for the hills, You'll become  4.|`|44Sj3bsZaa	I suggest you dating him longer and decide over time. I don't see the problem of him being married three times but I do think you should PROCEED WITH CAUTION. He sounds like he is just a  romantic guy that was blinded by love like most of us have been. You are the only one who can decide what is best for you and if this guy makes you happy and you love him with all your heart then Marry him! If you decide to do this then you can not live in the past and will have to love him and not worry about what he was doing before you because that will only cause a burden on you and strain the relationship.  Good Luck~ oh and if you have alot of assets just protect yourself with a prenup!
mfbKe04Xaa	first of all have some dignity...if your friend does not like you...leave it alone...There's friends that are suppose to be there for a season and those that are suppose to be there for a life time...your ex-friend is obviously seasonal..move on|`|U2x4PKyzaa	let her (in a text message if you feel more comfortable that way) know she is a big part of your life and that you don't want to lose her.

n4oOFWGEaa	It is actually very common to do so. However, it is not healthy for you. Like you said it starts to bring up you missing the good times and you said you don't want him back. So I would not necessarily talk to him everyday. I would call him back when it is convenient for you and also maybe get yourself out there and make new "good times" so you don't always think about the past. Remember to never match what times you had before to what you are doing now. "If someone keeps looking at the past they don't see the opportunities that are happening now."|`|aglLU9acaa	if you broke up with him, he probably wants you back and if this is the case, explain to him that you ARE just friends.     If he broke up with you, he might just be sending you a message that he made a mistake, in which you should again tell him you are just friends, or he is just looking to stay friends, and if THAT is the case, then you can move on to different guys and still have the good times      P.S. i hope my advice helps you|`|hEAuWYYjaa	well it isnt a problem to be friends with your exbf because i am doing the same thing.so dont worry just because you arent dating him doesnt mean that youstill cant be friends|`|8y8PpQvnaa	Not common at all, and pretty unhealthy.

People say they can change sometimes...and surely I believe allot of great stuff alternatively.  People don't change that much ....maybe physically sorta...but not mentally.  They're usually the very same personality and person that left you previously.........and for certain that don't change much!  ...need more?...email me if ya do....k?|`|n5YIvC1Aaa	im friends with almost all of my exes.|`|ceKPCWryaa	everyone thinks they know what is best, but it's honestly about yourself, follow your heart, and live your life! have fun! your only young once!|`|Fdm7fN0Caa	I talk to my ex almost everyday.

If he shows progress then its good. Yet for now I don't think anyone could give a clear cut answer.|`|aglLU9acaa	keith definately likes you    Eden might be afraid to talk, because of what you think, tell him that you think you might be interested in him, but you want to know more about you. if he's not interested in you tell him that you want to be friends then    and in order to be friends, you have to know more about him    so either way, he needs to talk      P.S.  i hope my advice helps you|`|rhXKnirZaa	mabey for the sexxx|`|AA11921269	Well have you ever been around a guy who does like you?  If so, what did he say and do?  Usually a person can tell when someone likes them.  I think that if he did, he would be asking you out, like now.  Is he with someone already?  There is a good site called "Dating Without Drama" and it gives lots of good advice.  Check it out.  Good luck.
ZbrOzGnWaa	You two need to decide what is most important to you. Being together or avoiding the consequences that some with being together(and there are a lot of them).  You may not be supported by friends or family. Also, having children may not work well.  But know that you are not wrong because you can't help your feelings. Take inventory over what is more important to you, and decide what to do form there. Also, talk to him about it and see what he thinks is more important.|`|ln2NPIg6aa	What part of Kentucky are you from???|`|7p1fsPCnaa	YOUR GROSS AND SICK  SOMETHINGS WRONG WITH YOU|`|k1YzPe4Naa	omg wow...um marriage or blood?|`|04EZZKFBaa	If you really love each other than let it live on!

Lovers love the feeling of being in love. Friendship need love to Relationships start out with love and a good life can end with love.    Then thinking further about it, love itself is the end product of something that we all take for granted. I think my answer is TRUST, then LOVE.    Lovers need trust in order to fall in love. Relationships start with trust as a foundation. Life ends with trust that we did not live our lives in vein.    Thanks for posting this deep question. We all need trust and love with one other!    Other answer is "rendezvous"..Rendezvous i.e. a meeting...|`|RF2YV9ataa	Heart|`|h3uUzhtiaa	The letter E

You said yourself she made some really immature decisions and she insisted on keeping the house, so to help her at all now would be very counter prodcutive for her, let it go.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	If you can help and you want to, please do it.  Just because you are divorced doesn't mean that you can't be concerned or helpful when you can.  Be careful how you approach her about it though, you don't want to embarrass her.  Just let her know that you know about the fore closer and ask if there is anything you can do.  Then offer what you can at that point.

I'm not sure what I would do in your situation since I am divorced as well but since we have three children together I would do what is necessary to ensure that they are taken care of, not necessarily my ex.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	This is part of your problem is that you feel like your interfering with things. YOU BOTh needed to interfer with her teenage son getting in the middle of your marriage. You BOTH should not ALLOWED that to happen!!!!! You two should have been mature enough to know not to let the teenager have the run of the show!!! But if you want to help, then go ahead. I think you still have feelings for her. And if you do, then figure out what you both did wrong and go from there.  HEY THERES MY FRIEND!!!! INTERNET HATE MACHINE!!!!  Where have you been pal???? I've been looking for you>>> LOL|`|fRIEHBJOaa	she'll never learn. this is her issue now. as long as your children, if you have any with her, have a place to stay i wouldnt worry about it. i'm sure she has family that will help her and there is also social services. she bit off more than she could chew. it happens and it's sad, but it's also life. so let her deal with her own issues now.|`|y9CgveCGaa	I don't think you would really be helping her.  She sounds financially irresponsible and she would probably not use the money wisely.  Let her learn a lesson and keep yourself out of trouble.|`|MYbRICxqaa	I will help her out, but then again will she be the type to keep begging for more?|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	While your heart is in the right place, you may only be delaying the inevitable. If you are trying to help her save the house how will she prevent this from happening again in a few more months when she still doesn't have the money for the mortgage?  If your intent is to help her find a more affordable place to live, then by all means help her if you want.|`|tM2MN5NOaa	Don`t give her anyting.- you`ve done your bit by letting her have the house - If now she can`t afford it - thats "her problem" you`ve moved on and don`t feel "guilty!!  Spend your money (what ever you`ve got) on yourself. What you had with her has "long gone" and you "owe her nothing"  Don`t get "sucked into this latest problem she`s got"    You`ve had to start again - so can she!!  If she had any sense she would have seen this comming a long time ago - with regard to the payments etc. and she should have agreed to sell the house at the time and split what ever was left between you both. Maybe her and the son see you as the "money cow" well not anymore!!!|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	let her deal and stay out of it.|`|0Opi3SWKaa	if she is still single yes. u dont owe her anything but it would be nice if u did. if she isnt single, tell her man to do it.|`|zYf8YL06aa	your attitude is very admirable.  go ahead and help her, just make sure that you inform her that you are only helping her to get on her feet again and so that she is not on the roads and that this offer has no strings attached.|`|Gx14PIvxaa	Nope. She made her bed, now she can lie in it.|`|AA11460234	Don't open doors to Hell that you've already closed, locked and bolted shut.    Too bad. Only goes to show that she still can't manage her financial affairs like an adult.    Her problem sport...not yours anymore.    I say let her sink. Help her and you may find yourself eventually getting dragged down with her. plus...she may expect you to carry her on everything in the future if you bail her out.    Stay away. Treat this like Kryptonite.|`|AA12202402	A friend of mine was in a similar situation not because he wanted to get back with his ex-wife but just mainly because he is a good person. He got stomped on by his ex. She used him up until he finally said no....Then at that point she got upset and he not only lost money he lost a friend|`|O46f8wl3aa	I understand your desire to help her, it sounds like you still care very deeply for her. My advice is do not offer the money, offering the money can do one of two things; she'll think you wanna get back together, or she might take insult to it and think you're insinuating she can't handle her own finances - no matter how true it might be.    People always figure it out, people always weather the storm... she needs to find her own way. It helps a person grow - and I'm not trying to be mean, I'm being very serious.|`|nX1QW5GCaa	You have no obligation beyond any spousal or child support the courts have ordered you to pay.    Decision is totally up to you.  If she was just a close friend instead of ex-spouse, what would you do?  If you can and feel you want to help, do it.  But, don't feel guilty about not helping if that's your choice.    I've been giving my ex $1000/month for the last 10 years.  I know what I'd tell her if she asked for money.  :)|`|Bq51x58jaa	dont u think u did enough(u gave her the house for gods sake). sounds like even when u were married u were bailing her out and thats part of the reason u divorced so why would u want to keep doing it. she needs to stand on her own two feet. if u keep helping she will never become independent and will always end up needing u. if u really dont want to get back with her then i def would not help as it will be keeping u involve all the time which is not what u want or is it?|`|GjifanQlaa	there is nothing wrong with being kind to another person in need. if you want to help her, by all means help her.|`|GLKD89wnaa	Stay a way from her.|`|AA11180444	Stay out of it.  She made her choice by taking the house.  You are no longer part of the picture and it was her fault she lost the house.  Don't help her, it's not your fault.|`|nN64tE6qaa	I understand that just because you are divorced does not mean you stop caring about the well being of your ex. She is the author of her situation. It seems that you did warn her about the mortgage. If you want to give her some funds while she is down and out then that is really up to you.     I would make sure that she understood that this is just what you mean it to be, a gift (not a loan, she is probably not in a position to pay you back anyway) with no strings attached because you want to help a "Friend" who is in a bad way. If she insists that she will pay you back then accept this and let her know that she can do this when she is in a better financial position.    Make sure she understands that this is not an overture to get back together. You will have to spell this out to her if you decide to help her financially.    Let her know that you don't have deep pockets and won't be able to help her with more funds later.    If she refuses the money, do not force the issue. It will look like you are trying to interfere with her freedom.     Keep it simple and friendly, no hugs or kisses or dinner dates as these may lead her to think it is something other than one freind helping out another.    Good luck and tread light|`|B1sT1t44aa	I would not do it because if she cannot handle keeping the home now then she will not handle it after you catch her up with your money.  I would not bail her out because she needs to learn not to make so many bad decisions for herself to survive on her own. You were already generous enough to take a loss on the house so now let it be hers. Move on with your life and let her move on with hers and find yourself someone that doesn't give you stress.|`|5MAx8mHxaa	I would only help my ex-wife...off a cliff!! You owe her nothing,she should've read the fine print,it's not your problem anymore.|`|cCdhHyF8aa	She's an adult and this may help her to realize that maybe it's finally time to start making the right decisions. If you keep helping her she will alays rely on it and never learn.|`|e5hS8BY7aa	give her  only one hundred dollars see how she acts.   nerver expect to get it back.  after that wait a little bit then you will now what to do.  if you give anything never ask her to give it back  if you give her a loan, don't expect her to pay you back
IKXZZDH9aa	If your husband had them under his insurance and he was the policy holder, then he is the responsible party, it doesn't matter whether the child was his. When they divorced, these things should have been settled then, but if not it will take going to court to have an order rendered to force the ex wife to pay her own medical bills. If in the order she was to pay them, then you need to have the order enforced.    You don't have to give them any information about your income, as these are bills he brought into the marriage and  that is of no concern to you, nor are you liable.     I would tell the collection company to stop calling my house and that you will seek legal relief if they don't.     Have your husband figure out what the hell is going on by first reading the order and settlement agreement.|`|cGGvZqJNaa	Yeah, he is responsible.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	yeah, when you marry a dude, you marry his past baggage as well.  you're responsible.    doesn't that suck worse than Aaron Rodgers?   lol.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Probably, at the time the medical treatment was done, he signed as the responsible person.    If the divorce decree specified she is responsible for paying those debts, then they're hers, if not, he's still responsible.  There is not statute of limitations on a debt.      You can make very minimal payments to the hospital.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	If they were married, he's responsible IF they can't collect from her. The statute of limitations is a tricky one. It's not really based on date of service. It based more on time of collection, and collection agencies know how to keep a collection case active and current, so you won't have an argument there. I would give them her info or if you ultimately end up paying, sue her for reimbursement (you can refuse to give them your info but if they are determined they will get it).  It's not that you are more responsible for the bill, it's that they found you first...|`|29hcn9JRaa	As of 2006 they changed the statue of limitations, they are more strict and use many methods to obtain what they see as money owed, they now recycle the debt and turn them over to what are known as scavenger  collectors, this is when it starts getting ugly, as they can now garnish wages, take any money you may be getting back in income tax, basically do whatever it takes to get their money. Looking at your husbands time line, I think that this collection agency is on the up and up and is valid, I really do sympathize with your situation, however you may end up having to pay? My brother used to be a manager at a collection agency, and he claimed that statues of limitations became more lengthy then after to 2006. Believe it or not, most of these people who work in collection agency's are quite good at making someones life miserable, however most of them lack education and basically have zero sympathy for other peoples hard times, they care nothing about you, they simply want money.|`|Bq51x58jaa	dont know|`|2sF0qPjBaa	No technically since her name is on the bill SHE is responsible. Unless somewhere on that bill his name appears then just ignore the phone calls. Collection agencies will call anyone and everyone that they think is connected to a situation in order to get paid.  Medical bills are not the same as credit cards, if you weren't the one receiving treatment then you are not the one that needs to pay. The only way you would be responsible for the child's is if you were the biological father.|`|FAQldsUZaa	If they are divorced, then no he isn't responsible. However, my mother is still receiving unpaid bills for my step father and they divorced about 6 years ago. But the reason you are responsible is because your husband is not working, and the wife and/or husband is then responsible for payments. Hirer (if money is prohibited) a lawyer to fix this problem for you.|`|AA12202402	If they were married and his name was on anything as her husband yes he is responsible. Her services alone doesn't matter since they were married|`|GmMB5HtCaa	I think unfortunately if the bills were in his name he is still responsible for them however I don'tt think you have to give them your income ,but I wouldrecommendd you get an attorney to deal with it for you.
BPrMusoLaa	I never had a sweet 16 so Im putting myself in her shoes!!!! I think u should get her a blinged out cell phone. U can take it to a phone retailer and have them customize the phone 4 you with black diamonds, skulls and crossbones and u dont have to have a bill. You can buy the expensive phone and pick a network with limitations. My boost cell phone is only $50 mthly. Unlimited talk, text, nights and weekend and I have the wireless web! There are other good networks also check it out. YOU CAN REALLY TOP IT OFF BY GETTIN HER, HER FAVORITE SYMBOL,(GUITAR, CROSSBONES...) IN THE FORM OF A NECKLACE OR BRACELET AND GET 16 ENGRAVED ON IT SOME WHERE. HANG THE JEWELRY ON THE PHONE THROUGH THE LITTLE HOLES ON THE TOP.Basically put the two gifts together so that she will be more surprised. I mean come on she'll be like ''OH I GOT A CELL PHONE ITS SO PRETTY'' But when she actually examines the phone she will really be shocked to see jewelry. I can see it now!!! She will definetely forget about that car for a while. Even if u dont use my ideas just really come from the heart. I wish someone would have thought about me like u r thinkin about your daughter. TELL HER DIVA D SAYS STAY SWEET AFTER 16....|`|ujd4RMR7aa	A sybian.|`|sPxmH9yQaa	I understand your thoughts about the phone. That's why you set an amount of minutes per payment that are usable. It might also help if you get her unlimited texting. It may cost a bit more, but it will save you more money in the long run. If you get her to sway towards texting more then you won't have to worry about your bill. However, is it possible that she doesn't want a phone that maybe she wants something completely different. Maybe her friends know. It might be best to ask the ones who get inside your daughter's head the easiest.|`|3OeE8kMQaa	I think and IPhone with unlimited texting is the way to go... she will be ecstatic and you will be the "cool mum" for at least a week, which is pretty good when your kid is 16.|`|ee16bd6fa8f2d93667b5d5f76c2e7c8caa	A piece of fine jewelry would be a good way to mark the 16th. In addition to the fine piece, get a cute "skull and crossbones" type of jewelry as well. One that is cool to wear now and the fine piece she can wear fondly in the future.|`|X6I49NUZaa	Well you said she was not a girlie girl but my mom bought me a ring for my 16th birthday, I went and picked it out and its a tiny little diamond ring i wear on my right hand.  I absolutely love it, I wear it everyday!|`|tsUHbtI2aa	sweet 16 party at home..............|`|G5Ut9prSaa	You could get a cell phone and just put minutes on it, that way you always know what the bill will be like, because you decide. I'm not a girly girl, but I don't surround myself with skulls and crossbones either... but when I turned 16 my grandma gave me a ring, which I thought was really nice... my parents gave me money (which I also thought was really nice!)|`|8txWayVnaa	Does she have an iPod, or MP3 player?  If not, then an iPhone would be an AWESOME gift!  You could load it up with some of her favorite tunes before giving it to her, along with a gift card to iTunes so that she could download more music.  You could also have her other family members and friends load her up with accessories for her iPhone.  Trust me, she would LOVE it!    As far as the bill is concerned, you can put her on  your plan, and select a package that would be suitable for you.  Be sure to get "unlimited texting" as that is the most popular form of communication between teenagers.
T3BXC8qXaa	If penetration is painful right after she reaches orgasm, do something else for a while and her body will recover. It takes a while for those muscles to relax after but the nice thing about being a woman is it doesn't take long to relax again. Let her pleasure you in other ways while she's recovering and penetrate her again when she's ready. Play a game with her to see how many times she can orgasm in one night. Learn what relaxes her in between. It might be talking, massage, pleasuring you, laying still. Put some relaxing music on and play....for hours if needed....|`|d20mM90uaa	FOR REAL, I WISH I WAS THAT QUICK  OR MAYBE SHE JUST DON'T LIKE IT AND SHE FAKES IT  THAT WOULD SUCK IF THAT IS WHAT SHE IS DOING LOL|`|ZaMzRSrraa	you have to learn to not get her off soo soon  practice more..change positions frequently....|`|vFCva8R5aa	switch things up a bit when she is about to go over the edge... or stop whatever it is that you are doing that is about to make her go over the edge.

If you are over 18 your parents can't say, if your under 18 then yes they can stop you.|`|d3icrU62aa	If the couple is over 18, they can do whatever they want|`|gRZT4pnUaa	If you are over 18 you can marry anyone you want. If you are under 18 you have to have your parents have to be there and maybe sign something.|`|0Id85yiYaa	yes, they can as long as you're over 18|`|FVFxE6owaa	If both people are over the age of consent (which is 21 is Mississippi, like slh39702 pointed out), then they can get married whether their parents agree with it or not.  If one or both people is under 21, parents must give their written consent.|`|ZvFamJM8aa	if they are legally allowed to then they should follow their hearts|`|DqetlSB6aa	if their of age they can....doesnt matter where you live|`|ge7QGN9Zaa	Sorry, you must be 21 in the state of Mississippi to marry without parents' consent. Under that, parents must sign.    I remember my uncle and aunt signing for their daughters who were 18.
H7LwCrZ2aa	You are making it harder for yourself by doubting yourself, you go to the dance class, and you are not embarrassed to dance,  Use the confidence you show when you dance. I don't think she will be shocked , Girls are very perceptive about feelings, they know what you are thinking most of the time anyway. But do this in private as she may not want this type of thing to come, out in front of other people. You have a much better chance at a hug or what ever she feels in private. Just do it, or you will get down on yourself,  She won't laugh or hit you.  You know her, She is a nice person.|`|1EKZqOdwaa	If she likes you too, just go for mate.    I was in a similar situation before.  After a while, I just went for it, and it turned out that she loved me too :)|`|8j0UDKWYaa	Aww thats really cute.. well be confident . talk to her and get to know about her . cause girls love when a guy go up to them and start talking to them|`|RwEpGG4caa	I like guys who are honest about their feelings..so go ahead tell her how to feel..when it comes from heart she will know it...it feels very special when someone says those 3 magical words.. ask her to come with u for a walk or take her to a quiet place and tell her how u really feel about her..    Good Luck!!!
mzkfSwLwaa	cant turn love into hate then it becomes unfair =]  get a grip.|`|0QZz1bhkaa	did u tell him how u felt? that might change him.|`|smyhq0Ggaa	Why would you want to hate anyone?    There's enough hate in the world without trying to create some on purpose, if you don't hate him already then he obviously doesn't deserve it.|`|wADnvKGFaa	Why would you want to hate him?  Did he wrong you in some way?  Not loving you back is no reason to hate someone.  Try to overcome this and become friends.  I know its hard, but in time its the right thing to do.  Hate should not be someone you aspire to have towards anyone.|`|8KGJj67aaa	Hating him wont make it easier.    Trust me on that one....all you have to do is convince yourself that he didn't deserve your love....that you are way better than he ever deserves.    You can get past this love easy...It will just take some time.      Good luck!|`|GvgmSxdCaa	Hate should be turned into love ...     Hate is everywhere, spread some love for a change.     And if he doesn't feel the same about you just move on ...   Live, forgive and forget too.|`|ZaMzRSrraa	DATE HIS BEST FRIEND|`|40qTdKuPaa	If you love him, love him! Soon, if will fade. Hope this helps.|`|iqNcXWsOaa	Get married!!|`|2c88J3M7aa	Think about all the negative qualities/ characteristicts he has, and hwnever you start to think of him, just remember all his negatvie traits =)
2SrcH7bBaa	I don't know, you can take him to a professional and try to keep him busy so he won't have to stay with them for much time, and give him a lot of support|`|quM6eMT6aa	sorry not much you can do law only punishes physical abuse i can juss advise you to be a supportive girlfriend and listen to him maby suggest he sticks  up for himself|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	be some one that he can trust and talk to|`|2d281c378a62cabf9789c151186cae74aa	Yes.  Immeadiately tell a teacher, conselor or clergy person.  Do not wait.  They have been through this before and can help!|`|8gOIc4dMaa	You should talk to him about telling an adult if it is really that bad.|`|iXzQWjBUaa	what you need to do is talk to your boyfriend and ask him what is going on at home and when he tell you ask him is there anything you can do to help him and if he say know their is nothing you can do then you still do something to help him...............good luck|`|wPNoylTuaa	if i was you i would talk to him first and ask him if he wants help or not. also let him know that if there is anything you could do then you wold help. i think that you should let adult know about what is going on with your parents but make sure that he wants help. don't go and tell his secret if he don't want anyone to know because it can ruin you relationship. overall, this is a serious problem and should get help ASAP!
cBMwHdn4aa	who is giving the check?  you mean dated april 29, 2009?  what for and for how much?  do you trust him?      money breaks up the closest of friends and family, so be very very cautious.|`|yOsEeTUnaa	I agree with brit...it all depends if you trust him or not and really for how much. Say it is for $50 then it might not make a huge difference if by April it bounces...but if you are talking a couple hundred/thousand then that definitely makes a difference!
WDs4fRoxaa	Put a password on your laptop and your psp, and then take the batteries out of your digital camera and hide it.    Make the password: Not for_______(insert her name)    She will never guess it.    Best wishes|`|77NzfiVkaa	Tell her to knock it off and password protect your laptop.|`|Ga11Abmzaa	punch her in the face|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	put a lock on your door you can replace your door knob with an locking knob if you can use a screw driver|`|gjdd7bVWaa	Booby-trapping is illegal.  Password the computer.  You can set it so that it even password protects after the screensaver is moved off.  Hide everything valuable.  Change the locks on your doors, although your mother might get a bit angry about that.  If you can, get one with a key.  The ones with allen wrenches are easy to get into.  Password everything you can, tell her to knock it off, and if she continues, call the police.  Even if you are a minor, having your mother deal with the police may be a wakeup call to her.  She'll probably decide to not press charges, but it might scare the girlfriend as well.  Or she may just get angry and steal more stuff.  If you're in the house while the girlfriend is there, go into your room and lock the door.|`|QieRAMLkaa	tell her, listen I understand you want to use my stuff but I am going to tell you to ask EVERYTIME you use something and if you can't respect me enough to do that then you can't use it.  Its nothing against you but I like to know where my stuff is, you don't see me going through your things, I don't want you going through mine.    Tell the same to your brother and your mother about it.  That you need to be told and you don't want people outside of your family going in your room when your not there.  Ask you brother, would you like my boyfriends to go in your room and just take things, no, so don't let your girlfriend do that.  Its comes down to you putting your foot down, the girlfriend is overstepping boundaries and is completely disrespectful.    I live with my brothers in law (5 of them, with 4 girlfriends who stay over often) and I ask every time I even go in their room, and their girlfriends are told to knock and wait at my door if they want to speak to me or borrow something, or to call my cell phone.  If any of them go against what I say, they hear quite an earful from me and get told, you can't respect me  I am not going to respect you so get the hell out.|`|aovGcD2iaa	1.sock her in the face          or tell your brother about it|`|CZFcH1ykaa	Call the police! Not your fault if they gey mad bc they wouldn't listen.|`|9ed226ee22a85f302293fed29122bfe1aa	Password block the laptop.    Hide the camera and psp (don't just leave them in the open).    Booby trap the draw they're usually in if they're always in the same place and she knows it, so she gets hit with it and theres proof she was going through your stuff.|`|7wkHVaNyaa	Lock your door. Tell her to not go in there, tell her not to use your computer etc..|`|wZMq5jqyaa	okay. u have to knock her out. NO other choice. or call the cops on her.|`|6kRhLbs9aa	I WOULD CALL THE POLICE. STEALING IS SO WRONG!|`|RKMxAKDIaa	first dont call the police, she is annoying u not doing a crime unless she doesnt return them, to stop her just ask her not to go through your room taking your stuff, tell her to ask if she wants to borrow them and if she is doesnt then talk to your brother about it good luck x

bQ2RWRGNaa	well no need to be ashamed. i got small ones, im proud of them. even my husband loves them :P Infact, he cant keep his eyes of them :P oh sorry too much detail :P|`|3y0w1qIBaa	You should talk to your friend about this.  Your friend has no right to make fun of you.|`|cBMwHdn4aa	maybe she's just jealous bc you're thin.  if she keeps it up remind her that noone's perfect, including her and her fat ***, or whatever is appropriate.  she should be able to take it, afterall, she's been dishing it out!|`|yOsEeTUnaa	Just talk to her about it. If she really is a close friend, she should understand that you are self conscious about it and listen to your feelings! Other than that...I grew up with small boobs...you just have to make the most out of what you got and make people notice other things about you!|`|AA11583338	Well what I would suggest that you do is you claim that your close friend is among those who make you uncomfortable by laughing at you because of your small breasts.  I would sit down and try and have a heart to heart talk With this friend about how what she does by laughing at you makes you feel.  I would let her know that although our friendship is important, so are your feelings and you won't allow anyone to make fun of you anymore and you would hope that if she has any flaws (which she does) she would not expect you to laugh at her and  make her feel bad; so by the same token--you want her to respect and care for you as you do for her.  If she doesn't understand or continues to make fun of you maybe just maybe it might be time to take a closer look at just how close you two really are!|`|sWkT50Moaa	Don't laugh with her, don't get angry, just calmly tell her that you don't like people joking about your body. Im sure she means no harm, but if you laugh with her then you are telling her its ok for her to joke about you. If you are worried about your shape, don't be, Im a DD and I cant run comfortably, wear backless/ strappy tops, find bras that fit and don't look like maternity bras... the list is endless. My sister is a B cup and I envy her so much! Love the body you're in and let everyone else's comments flow past you. Youll come out better in the end.

Having said that , here's a novel suggestion: How about at least TRYING to be a man. You need to tell her that the marriage is over and that you don't want to pretend otherwise anymore. If she asks if there is someone else, you need to come clean. You are beyond a loser to think that you can betray your wife on her dime. You deserve an old fashioned beating, courtesy of your wife's older brother.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	Just tell her like it is.

UEXhKr60aa	Ok, so I read your story and I just think because of bad experiences she's had in the past....she just thinks cause that guy was bad, all black guys are bad. (Which they're not) But really I just think she's trying to protect you.  And your right, you cant control who your attracted too.  But if you marry a black guy and you love him and you both care about eachother...then it doesnt matter what your mom says.  Your 27, YOU control YOUR own life.  Your mom won't disown you.  She is just saying that cause she thinks that will make you listen to her.  I can tell your mom loves you so much and she just wants to protect you.  Just explain to her nicely how your feeling. But dont say its wrong you dont like black guys.  Never tell her she's wrong otherwise she'll automatically get mad...thats just what people do So hope that helps and I wish you the best of luck :)|`|XHBjoWtyaa	Since you don't live with your parents bring your curry luving *** to the dark side|`|0Mi6AQwxaa	listen , im a sikh, punjabi and ill tell you that other races can marry and divorce - you live in a more conservative society. Sure , you can marry and divrce too, but it may become a little bit more difficult for you, unless you are totally financially secure and emotionally not attached to your parents and not really in touch with the Punjabi community. <br>  <br>  i repeat - Im sorry for being such a racist pig, but your choice of 2  Blacks and an arab speaks volumes for your preferences. Your 27, you should know better. please dont go down this path and ruin your life. read www.faithfreedom.org to understand how Muslims work and use your commonsense to understand how blacks work. <br>  <br>  F around all you want, probably black men do it better. But dont spoil your reputation, and eventually when you decide to get married marry someone you like from the an Indian, White, Chinese Japanese Korean type. You have better chances for a sucessful life. <br>  <br>  i really want to help you and my answer is only for you and not for the dumb childish pretentious fools who are misleading you with their answers|`|3PF3lt5Qaa	Your mum needs to understand that being treated badly by one person does not give her the right to tar all black men with the same brush.  Would she have done the same if you'd been treated badly by an Indian man?<br>  <br>  You're right that you can't help who you are attracted to, nor should you try to be.  Life is as enriching as it is because of the many cultures within our world, not in spite of it.<br>  <br>  I know it's very difficult but you are 27, you must make your own decisions and your parents need to allow you the freedom to do that, and the respect to trust your judgement.  So you made a mistake in the past ... haven't we all?  We learn from them, and you will too.<br>  <br>  You will already recognise the signs that were there in your last bad relationship, the trigger points that we don't see at the time, or that we are blind to because of love.  You will look out for them in future, and be more aware of developments.<br>  <br>  When you meet the right person, whatever race they are, you just have to be honest with them.  Explain your mum's behaviour and the reasons for this, and if they are the one you're meant to be with they will help you work through these problems - help you to prove to your mum that her preconceptions are wrong.<br>  <br>  I hope that everything works out for you, but please be strong and listen to your heart ... don;t be ruled by your parents.  There comes a time when you need to show them you're an adult and WILL make your own decisions regardless of their advice.  Maybe this is that time.<br>  <br>  Good luck xx|`|b4de922b856661f693a454b42214d526aa	it is important to listen to our parents sometimes.but it is up to YOU who you choose to date and who you choose not to date.if your mother truely cares for you and wants you to have any happiness then she would respect your wishes i know that sounds kinda harsh.has your parents arranged a marriage for you is this why she is reacting like this.|`|jD1JY0BJaa	Just do whatever you want and don't waste your time worrying about what your mum thinks.

One should never mistreat another because of these superficial things.<br>  <br>  Now, culture is a different thing.  Your Mom only wants you to have the benefit of your culture of origin and she is not comfortable with popular world culture of your age group.  I can't blame her, because I'm probably close to her age.  We don't like the loud, crude manner in which people of the popular culture act.  This often includes blacks, but can include folks from all races.  <br>  <br>  Just remember, she is probably reacting to the bad "cultural" experiences she has had, and associates these experiences with culture.  You have to assure her that the man you will seriously date will definitely respect your culture and you will make sure that is a primary point of your relationship.<br>  <br>  Your Mom doesn't want you to lose your heritage and have grandchildren who have become a dilution of her hard work and background.  You have to remind your Mom, though, that she gave up a lot of that control when she left India.  You didn't choose this way to grow up, she did.  Be gentle about it.  Don't hurt her.<br>  <br>  By the way, I would never get involved with anyone from India!  I love the food, but the culture doesn't mix for me.  That doesn't mean that I can't stand Indians!|`|AA10928214	You really need to do what you need to do. You're mother is going to have to live with her racist self for the rest of her life.

AA10986891	HE HITS YOU? ADJUSTMENT PERIOD?     WOW LOVE IS NOT ABUSE - If he can not respect you? How is he going to love you. A man who hits a woman is not a man is a coward. Yes the first years of marriage are tough but there is no justification for a man to hit a woman.    My marriage only lasted two years, my ex wife drove me crazy she even slapped me and threated me a coupe of times during arguments but not even then I raise my hand to hit her or threatened to hit her.    You really need to re-valuate your relationship with him.|`|AA11603468	First, I don't think violence is ever an answer to anything. If someone hits you, he needs to go. If you hit him, he;s obviously not bringing out the best in you. Since this is the case, why would you want to make a life with someone you clearly do not get along with? Please don't subject your innocent child to that-he deserves better, even if you don't think you do.    We've been together nearly 4 years, married almost a year. We've honestly never had a real argument, much less a physical altercation. Life is what you make it, and if you decide that you want your life to be full of fighting and turmoil, that's your business, but it is not normal, despite what anyone tells you.|`|Bc4udMhUaa	What??? Why is your baby 12 hours away. That's no good at all.    The first few months after my daughter was born were really rough for us. Slowly it got better.|`|Ih18jMNyaa	I have NEVER hit a woman!  NEVER!    Of course our first year was an adjustment but NEVER a hitting fight!|`|W8aiAWe2aa	My opinion is = he's a twat for hitting you and is an abuser!    Advice = leave the twat and go and live with your parents and baby.    Stay with this guy and he will either beat you all your life or kill you.|`|Kr09aQJkaa	Yes, it takes some time in the beginning to adjust.     What do you mean he hits you in the arms but not above the shoulders? How about you hit him it the balls but not the face?    Hitting is hitting. Don't stay with an abusive man and hope things get better with time. Big mistake!|`|QieRAMLkaa	honestly, if hes hitting you often...thats not adjustment, thats abuse.  trust me, my husband has hit me before we were married  on three occasions  (two of which I instigated the physical part)  but all three times he was very intoxicated, so our fix for physical violence?  don't get that drunk anymore.    Since we were engaged and married its never happened again.    my first few year of marriage has been very blissful, our only adjustment we had to make was getting on eachothers nerves for being together too often,  so we made guys/girls night    where we don't necessarily go out with our own friends but have a bunch of people over, he sits and plays poker with the guys, and I go and chat with the girls in the living room   It gives us a chance to de-stress and something to look forward to each week.|`|s6stLtvLaa	ummm, hitting is hitting.  If you are being hit during an argument that is a bad sign.  My husband and I screw around and hit each other but that is a mutual, all in fun type.  Not once has my husband ever raised a finger to me in anger.  We have lived together for 3 years now and we have been married for almost a year now.  Even from day one we had no problems.  So, why does your baby live with your parents?  Why is she not with you?  It is vital for the baby to be with their parents the first couples of months of their lives.  You are going to find you have a baby who is going to prefer your parents over you.  My son is almost 4 months old and the first 2 months he spent allot of time with my in-laws.  He sees my parents once a week and sees my in-laws about 2 or 3 times a week.  His is very happy with my in-laws and very comfortable.  At my parents he is a cranky little boy and wants nothing to do with my parents.  Those first few months are an important bonding time for a mother and a child.      Back to you boyfriend.  He needs to stop the hitting, it is only going to escalate and it is not a good environment for you or the baby.  My husband and I have had allot of crap thrown at us in the past year and no matter how often I loose my temper or how frustrated he gets with me he has never hit me.      Now, I have seen my parents have some nasty arguments.  My mom once broke plates (no joke, she pulled a stack out and broke all of the plates), by the time she was through my parents had to get new plates.  I have even seen my parents throw shoes (again, no joke) but never at each other.  They found ways to yell and get made without hitting each other, but there is no such thing as an adjustment period that involves hitting.  After a year of living together you two should have each other figured out by now.|`|i15KoiJhaa	What kind of Friends do you have sweetheart?!    Adjustment period??? Hell no!    This guy has no right to be hitting you anywhere, ever, for any reason!    This is an abusive person you're dealing with and like some others have stated, he is not hitting you in the face or obvious places because as most abusers... he doesn't want anyone to know he's doing it, because he knows it's wrong!    My advice honey, is get to your Parents house with your new Son, look for new work and let this guy know that although you now share a child together does not mean that you are going to share a life with him.    He can either get his crap together to get some help and participate in his Son's life OR he can ADJUST to paying Child support with limited Parenting time WITHOUT you in his life.    Get out honey before he really, really hurts you.|`|UwNKFSBeaa	horrible.  that's why I divorced him.|`|XeXM00Xjaa	Yes, every couple is different, but there should NEVER be hitting.  Ever.  Arguing is normal, that is part of the adjustment process, but it should not become violent.  It doesn't matter that it is not above the shoulders, he should not hit you, and you should not hit him.  If you want to make it work, try counseling, but make sure it is clear to him that baby or not, hitting is not acceptable.  If he hits you, you know he will hit the baby eventually, and do you want that?|`|AA10767560	NEVER NEVER NEVER is it ok for the guy to hit you.  NEVER.  Just because he doesn't hit you in the face doesn't mean he's not abusive.  He just abuses you in places that are easier to cover up so his sorry *** won't get caught.  Get out of that relationship and move to where your parents are and raise your kid.|`|pjgMW6qaaa	first of all....wtf  why have a baby if he is going to stay with your parents 12 hours away?  i don't let my parents take my 4 month old not even for a weekend..and i work  2nd....hit you? adjustments? really?    nooo sweetie. that's  not an adjustment that's called being with an abusive man.  My husband has never raised his hand at me. If he doesn't hit you above the shoulders does it make it any better?    if i was you i would have been gone.    your relationship does NOT sound normal at all.|`|0WstfAmzaa	I've been married a year, so I can tell you how my first year of marriage was..  It's a lot of adjustment to live with someone so intimately.  It's a lot of hard work, but completely worth it.  I love being married to my husband.  He's absolutely wonderful, even if things aren't perfect 100% of the time.  :)    Just on a side note, my husband never has nor ever will hit me, even "just the arms and legs".  That is not right, and you should seek counselling.    EDIT:  You shouldn't be hitting him either !!!  Physical abuse (and any other type of abuse) is never justified.|`|xGshAiXOaa	This is why they make birth control and condoms.  So that two people who have been living together for two months don't end up with babies.  And to top it all off, apparently you thought it would be a pretty good idea to bring an innocent child into this world with an abusive father.  Are you honestly stupid enough to think that him hitting you is an adjustment period?  I hope you leave that baby with your parents and away from the abuser you've chosen to make a life with.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	You both need to learn how to communicate better without resorting to violence.  Hitting each other is not a part of a modern culture.    I've heard (step father was highway patrol officer) that many immigrant husbands go to jail for spousal abuse and don't understand why.  Not just the language barrier, but it is just part of their culture to be physical when keeping their wives in line.    That just doesn't fly in the United States.  Whether you respect women or not, you aren't going to hit them without risking jail time.  They aren't slaves in our culture.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	"Adjustment period"? Are you serious? You've gotta be kidding. If my husband hit me, this would be the end of it - he'd never see me again after that. It's not adjustment period, it's disrespect and abuse, and both of you guys are being disrespectful to yourselves and one another. What a horrible example for the child.    Not only my husband and I don't hit each other, I don't know any married couple who does. Not my grandparents, not my parents, not my parents' friends, not my aunts and uncles, not my siblings, not my friends, not my husband's friends... the list goes on. It's definitely not "normal", don't rationalize it. Disrespect is toxic, and you both need to work to rid your relationship of it.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	He hits you? Adjustment period? I am sorry, but you are in an abusive relationship. No one should be hitting anyone in a healthy relationship.    My husband has never laid a hand on me in that manner. He probably hits you in places people can't see...    Edit: It is not your fault when he hits you. It is your fault when you hit him.|`|ZaMzRSrraa	hitting is not a adjustment period!..you are in a abusive marrige...get out now!!

I think it looks like Cinderella's dress!!|`|by9KuBizaa	My personal opinion would be to keep looking.  I don't particularly like big huge dresses and I don't like pick-ups.  I prefer to be able to be near my new hubs when I get married.    If these were the only options, I'd choose  1.    OK... you can all thumbs down..however, I gave an honest answer to the question posed|`|la28Sd9haa	I love 4, 5, and 6.. just remember that some of these styles are what is the in thing now, but could look silly in 10 years so I would go with the one you think is most timeless and not something you will regret|`|c41f417a3060cfc6a7f3b78b167af409aa	i think i like  1 the best, then  4.  5 and 6 look dingy...something about that color just doesn't look right.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	4|`|0jUGSaZPaa	http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?...

LVlS4y7Caa	Failure, heartbreak, sadness can lead any one, to do a desperate act.  Indeed, it is one thing to take yourself out, quite another to destroy your entire family...Realize that people just "snap" and in this economy?  We shall see a lot more undoubtedly...it takes money to live and when a parent can't provide, especially for their children as opposed to just having a spouse, well - sometimes they hit that rock bottom we hear about...    It is heart wretching, to state the very least...but that is what's happening in our world - the reality of lost jobs and worse yet?  Those perpetrators at the higher level who practice greed and deceit at our expense, day in and day out in their jobs.  You know who I mean, we the working class have been screwed by these entities and they seem to be everywhere...The law is finally catching up to many of them, but the long term damage is done in many cases, as you have observed like the rest of us.    Unfortunately dear, this is the world we live in - let us hope we are turning the "corner" once again, that the scales are swinging back to middle ground in our economy and nation and world - and that better restraints through more stringent banking and fiscal control will keep this type of destruction from happening again in our nation.  The resulting consequences continue to ruin families left and right...we haven't bottomed out yet.  Stay tuned.    Sincerely,    Grace|`|H3WHxCgaaa	If there was a rationale to it - they wouldn't be killing themselves.  In their minds it's the only answer...|`|AA11328507	There is no rationale.  Some people just do not have coping skills and do horrible, ridiculous, stupid things instead of seeking help.  Despair runs deep.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	This nation has generated a whole generation of narcissistic retards.  They buy buy buy. They run up there credit trying to live like the rich.  There is a whole generation of self delusional people. When reality sets in they can't handle the truth. Things go bad they blow there brains out. But because they are a narcissist. Those people think my life is messed up if I am going to kill myself. My family will have a better time after I'm gone. The hell with that. I'm going to take there lives too. I hope that helped you.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	I think some people measure their worth in terms of what they call theirs.  Someone who kills their family to protect them from being cared for by someone else is clearly a very selfish and deluded person.    It's sad, but whatever part of me is supposed to be moved to action by such happenings has gone silent.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Well, for one, most people who find themselves in this situation *don't* kill themselves or their family. But there are always people who are "different". These people are different from the majority in the way they operate and respond to stress. Some research points to differences in the brains of people who committed suicide and those who died of natural causes. It's still largely unknown what role these differences play, and what the cause and effect relationship is. So, there can be something fundamentally different about these people physiologically, and they respond in ways that most of us wouldn't even consider. Bottom line, we're barely scratching the surface in learning how mental states are generated and how human brain operates - it's impossible to say why, while most people's responses are adaptive, a select few go on a killing rampage in response to the same kinds of pressures. One day we'll know.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Well, a whole slew of businessmen flung themselves out of buildings when the stock market crashed in 1929 as well.......desperate people doing desperate things, I guess.....|`|ma6Re8B1aa	Well what do you want us to say?? REALLY>> that we understand why they do this?? Of course we don't. It's just that simple. But people get desperate and do some whacky things. People need to learn that they can get by without the things they think are important.|`|bf6c8c12038a0925b13989b7791d0d0caa	All we can do is take one day at a time and do the best we can. I fell the is a better way out than to take someones life|`|m8UEGUaGaa	Yes, we have all had hard times. But, as we know some people aren't as strong as others. Who ever really knows the stability of the mind. You speak of Killing for financial reasons but, people have killed their kids, spouses for unexplained reasons & far less stressful excuses have been given.     People should stay grounded in some form of religion and always Pray. If possible keep a watchful eye on loved ones, SO, family, friends that seem over loaded with stress or any signs of suicide.    I pray God spared the little ones pain & agony and have mercy on their little souls.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	Some people just don't see a way out. Family annihilators think that is what is best for their family. Strange but true. I don't get it myself. I think it is a combo of things. Lack of spirituality is a big one. These people are lost. The 70 year old man that was still a Billionaire with a B. Killed himself. I just don't get it. Not an option for us. We believe that God gets to pick the day we go. Every day he gives us is a blessing. He would never give us a challenge we couldn't handle. I accept them all.|`|4cdq26oraa	There is none.  Sorry, but if you are so bad off, be selfish and kill yourself, but you have NO right to take the life of your spouse and kids. Makes me sick every time I hear of this kind of garbage.|`|Gx14PIvxaa	I don't think it's about competition, I think it is about the raw desire of a man to take care of his own. In our society, we try and act like men and women are exactly the same creatures, when there are basic, biological, hormonal differences between the two - one of those being the man's role as protector and provider of the family.    Of course the men in these stories needed mental help, and it's not normal by any means, but I believe that their fears, inadequacies, and feelings of helplessness could be felt by any man who has just lost his job or is in some kind of financial distress. While not a healthy response, that one man was brutally honest about how he felt when he said something like "If we can't provide for ourselves, we may as well be dead".    I think it's much deeper than $$$$$. I think these people have mental and emotional problems that lead way, way, way back before they even started working.    At any rate, I think we should brace ourselves for a LOT more of this. The economy is going to get much worse before it gets better.|`|0ENtEMl1aa	i had a conversation with a close friend very recently about this and she would consider going all together rather than leaving her children here to fend for them selves.    i gave her a little friend "slap" and told her i feel the complete opposite about it. it was strange because i thought we were so similar but i was wrong.
Gx14PIvxaa	It's never, ever as bad to be "alone" as it is to be with someone who will hurt you. Ever.|`|BlFQwYMmaa	First of all if what you really want to do is leave this person you need to get all your finacial troubles out of the way and that would be getting a full time job and finding a place to rent, something small like a bachlor quite if u have kids you can apply for More child subsuty until they start paying childsupport. Maybe you have a friend you could crash with if they will let you|`|AhKaLuO3aa	You find some strength...even if it's the smallest bit right now...and you just leave. It may be hard at times, but I promise you it will pass. And in the end, you will have grown into a stronger woman, and you will be able to look in the mirror's reflection with much love for yourself. Gaining strength, pride, and self love are all things that only we ourselves can aquire. No one will ever be able to take these things away from you. Good luck. :)  **to the poster below me: it's funny that you suggest the song from Tesla! I actually used to listen to that song over and over when I was going through a hard time, and it did help! Even all these years later, whenever I hear that song, I get goosebumps and smile inside knowing just how strong I became. Good suggestion!**|`|1CqAQ3rlaa	look in the mirror,,and face the facts,,as much as it hurts and as painful asit is..you need to be with people who love you,,close friends or family..you will find love again..listen to the song by tesla 'the love song" the best love of your life could be out there waiting for you..this could be a blessing in desguise..one mans loss..is another mans treasure..or one mans nightmare could be another mans dream..  obviously this man hurt you..but Iam sure you did nothing wrong to deserve it..so focus on your good things you have..not the one thing you lost..you will find love again..i guarantee it..its out there..dont sit home crying..keep active and stay positive,,its happening for a reason..in time you will see..right now you don see or felit..BUT it will be Ok ,,stand your ground..dont go back to him to ease the pain..if he hurt you in the worse way..then the HELL with him..let someone else appreciate the good qualities you posess..and you will get the good love you deseve in return..its out there go find it..in time..remember listen to the song by Tesla..Love song..|`|61fcf832e5d4b87f1c941578ef4bacd3aa	Look at it in a positive way. Just think of it as a big adventure. Starting a new life, meeting new people.  Anyway, good luck to you in whatever you decide.|`|sCwe3rVNaa	You take it one breath at a time and do what you have to do.  I promise it will get easier to cope, but it will take time.  Let others help you financially and emotionally.  If you get to the point where you think you need emotional help, get it.    I know exactly how you feel because I have been there.  I remember the hardest part being that my whole world was shattered in a matter of minutes.  Nothing could be the same and everything had to change immediately.  All this without a single warning.  I had no control.  I had to leave (actually I made him leave) but I couldn't turn off my love as abruptly as he administered the pain.  As bad as it hurt, it took months for me to get past the pain and go into the anger.  That was when I could finally stop loving him.  Then everything turned back towards the light, because until then the darkness was excrutiating.    I wish I could hug you, or do something to give you just one moment of relief!    Talk to a friend, or a relative, someone who loves you and knows your situation.  Lean on them, and lean hard.  They will hold you up when you can't do it yourself.|`|grwtwPbAaa	First of all I would love just to carry you into that peace the Lord provide  s....I am so heart fully sorry as I feel your anguish and sorrow to.      I believe In Jesus Christ...so he is the first place I would go!  I would pour my heart out to him, and find some church whereby I would meet some loving Christians...and some churches even have wonderful spirit filled counselors!  Some even have courses which help people get through grief of divorce, separation, death. etc.Some times people will even take you in if you need a dwelling...     The worst thing you are feeling is the inability to move forward...and these things can be difficult...do one thing at a time!  What is wonderful is that these trained people can o  pen the doors, lead you to the right places...maybe even assist you as comforters  by going with you...    take baby steps if you are too drained...one step at a time!  One thing done each day if that is all you can muster...but please get in touch with a good Christian group of people who will carry your burdens and pray with you!    God bless you, wish you were here!  I would help you!|`|AA10554783	Give your self some time, Time heals a lot of wounds, get your self esteem back and think in a logical way as to the best for you and your future.|`|7tAH3GEBaa	There are obviously gonna be some all around changes.

I promise you will get through it.|`|VdTn7Gmbaa	Been there.  Done that.  The pain had to be absolutely unbearable   before I made my choices.  The best decision I ever made was trusting and  fully relying on God.  Yes, mine is a long story, as well.    E-mail me if you need to talk.  In the meantime, I pray you'll find   trust in Him.    God bless!                ? Comforting Prayer Warrior ?|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	I am sorry to hear you are feeling so sad...Time will help you, but you can also try to help yourself.     Have you tried counseling or therapy? Many times it's easier to talk to a total stranger than it is to talk to family or friends...    Please consider going to church more, too. Even if you are not a religious person, just being in a quiet place can give you peace and also give you time to think things over.    Life is not easy...and we all make mistakes. Sometimes we mean well, but hurt others along the way. And sometimes other people hurt us too. Be patient and kind to yourself. You will need time to heal and to learn how to deal with this experience.  Good luck.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Yeah, be with people who love you and care about you and people who can counsel you.  If you stay close to God, he will help you and bless you in ways you would never have thought of.  He brought two mentors (at different times) into my life when I was going through hell and these two mentors helped me tremendously, so God is able to make the sun shine for you again and bless you beyond what you would even imagine.  My husband left me for another woman and that was after years of abuse and he just always kept abusing me and refusing to discuss anything.  He was extremely selfish and this caused great pain not only for me but our 3 children also.    Get close to the Lord and he will reward you.
DKeut6FQaa	I was enjoying a nice romantic dinner with the mailman and then I noticed my husband standing outside with a baseball bat......needless to say that date didn't end well!|`|NZpRrCBtaa	I had just split up with a long term girlfriend and one of her friends asked me out. That in itself was strange because of the girl code, but it gets stranger still. She wants to stay in, watch a movie at her place and just get drunk or something. She's being all giggly and gets out a camera and starts taking pics of me. She finally gets around to asking for a nude shot and in my youthful stupidity and drunkenness I agree. She loses interest pretty quick and I have no idea what's going on. Apparently my ex had been bragging to her friends and misstated things by a hefty margin. Try carrying on after a moment like that. You're totally naked in a strange girl's apartment and she's dismissing you because you didn't measure up to her expectations. I'm pretty sure that made both our worst date experience lists.|`|vrsMTzNYaa	When you realise you are really not into them as much as you thought and you just want to wrap it up but can't  lol|`|16F6Qf7Paa	My husband and I were happy for twenty years...

I was pretty inexperienced at that point, and hadn't really had a real grown up relationship, so I was pretty shy to start things.  So I didn't realize that he had taken my lack of initative as a negative thing.  <br>  <br>  We went to a 4th of July party, and there were some other friends who didn't quite know that we were sort of a couple.  All of us had been drinking, and when I went to the other room to talk to some other friends (who were trying to get me to "make the next move" with him), one girl decided to take the "inititive" I lacked, and began making out with my "sort of" boyfriend.  When I had the courage to go for it with him and went back to where he was, I walked in on the whole thing with him and the other girl. <br>  <br>  I was crushed.  I instantly sobered up, and turned into an emotional wreck for the next 12 hours.  Needless to say, him and I were through, as far as I was concerned, even though he kept trying.

WOHc22Xiaa	If your old enough to move then go. If your not and your parents don't want to go then I guess your stuck where you are chicky!|`|pBpl3Bgaaa	My first question is how old are you? my second one would be, if your above 18 she can't stop you, so what are you waiting for?  With that being said, no reason not to move.|`|7kG5leXYaa	have you ever been to houston,dallas, san anotino?|`|BjtqWNt8aa	People are leaving California because it is too expensive to live there. People are losing their homes and jobs etc....If your parents make a good living and have jobs...Stay where you are!!! California will most likely be moving to flower mound texas very soon.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	if you are 18 or older the pack up and go, they can't stop you.    your parents are adults who have chosen to live where they want.  You're stuck with them until you can move out on your own.    FWIW:  the cost of living is better in Texas than it is in California and they can probably provide for you better there.  You may be very well off in Texas but if the family moves to California your standards of living may slip drastically.    edit:  you'd probably have an easier time getting them to take you to Cali on vacation.  google where in Cali you want to visit and get the info for them.    also I agree with the poster just above me.  You're close to Dallas and about 3 hours north of Houston.   Have your parents take you to visit those cities or get them to take you on a family vacation to San Antonio--it's very similar to Sonoma Valley in Cali and I know a lot of SV residents who have relocated there.
qN7xNavCaa	its obvious he likes you he just doen't know how to tell you. so flirt back at him and see where things go.
eytlIKITaa	Good for you!!!  Alcoholism is a very hard thing to deal with.  Especially being the kid.  It hurts a lot and it's really scary.  You did a great thing.  Keep doing it when you find the bottles.  I know they like to hide them too...  It's NOT immature.  You just care about him.  Does he have any interest in getting help at all?|`|twVyisGnaa	You are awesome for doing this.  Your father needs help no matter what the cost!    VIVA LA RAZA!|`|bVbFAyzjaa	I think you are doing a good thing.  If you keep getting rid of what he is addicted to, sooner or later he might realize how bad his problem is.  Good luck.|`|etLfz702aa	You rock for doing that! I do the same thing, it does really hurt. He needs to know. Keep doing it. If he wants to change his relationship with you, he can change his alcoholism.|`|0WstfAmzaa	My husband's father use to be an alcoholic and he used to do the same thing, dump all the liquor out.. I was so sad when he first told me that story because no child should have to go through something like that.    I don't think what you are doing is wrong... You are making a point to your father that his behavior needs to change.  Perhaps you could write him a letter and tell him how you feel and maybe that will motivate him to make the effort to change.  I don't know if that'll work or not.  My husband's father didn't stop until he broke his collar bone while drunk - and after that he quit.    But anyways, no I don't think you are immature for doing that.  Your father needs to take control of his life and not be enslaved to alcohol.|`|AX4ffdNbaa	way to go!  you are not a bad person and don't let anyone let you different. My father was an alcoholic, he's 20+ years sober now.My brother (we were in our teens then)  would dump the liquor, and re fill them  with water and then hide them. My dad yelled and screamed all the time. never got physical with any of us. You are not immature you love your father. He needs help . Where is your mother? you never said how old you are. My mother actually put her foot down and said it's either us or the booze. He went to a  treatment center and got better. It's not EZ it will take time. Tell him how much it's hurting you. let him know that you are in pain because of what he is doing. Don't give up on him . call AA in your area and ask for help . someone should be able to put you in the right direction. good luck and God bless your family.|`|5gZGZu8gaa	I'd say keep doing it.  Try to find someone who might be able to talk to dad about his addiction.
jcK6EXpiaa	Even if you have a DNA analasys that proves that you do have native american ancestry (which you can purchase the kits online) it will not gurantee your ability to enroll in any particular tribe, and even if you are able to enroll, it is not guranteed that you will receive any grants for scholarships. I am a 4.o student and very active in my tribe, yet I do not always get the scholarships I apply for. For a person like you, who does not even know for sure which tribe you may or may not belong to, the chances of receiving a scholarship are next to none. However, if you do wish to learn more about your hertage out of love and curiosity, I suggest you start with ancestry.com. Type in the names of all the ancestors you know, and if there are any government records linking them to a tribe, you may be able to prove descendency. After your tribe is identified, you have to contact their enrollment office, and ask them what their procedure is for enrolling intothe tribe, if you have enough native DNA in you to qualify. I can gurantee, however, if you go with the air of entitlement, as if your mere existence entitles you to be able to be recognised by a certain tribe and receive scholarships, then you'll probably be hung up on. Anyways, my tribe requires proof that you are a direct descendant of a person on our 1864 census, with at least 1/4 native american DNA that is tracable (1/8 of my blood quantum is not counted because my great grandpa was half canadian native). Then you have to take a DNA analasys to make sure you really are the grand child or whatever of the person you are linking yourself to (they compare your DNA with that of another descendants) then if that proves true, the tribe has to vote you in. We have rejected 11 of the 15 people who have wanted to be adopted within the past three years because of their air of entitlment. And some of them were full blooded indian...so you really gotta think about your reasons, because if you really do come from a tribe like mine, your greed will not be welcomed with open arms. But if your cherokee, I have heard that they are not too picky, so maybe you'll have some luck there. I suggest startin gwith ancestry.com. They do half the work for you.|`|ppR5kH4Yaa	3 things:    1) DNA cannot tell you which tribe, if any, you descend from.  DNA can tell you if you have markers similar to that of known native people, but again, cannot specify a tribe.    2) DNA is not accepted for tribal enrollment purposes.  Each tribe has its own enrollment requirements.  However, most of them have the requirements of being a descendant from an enrolled tribal member.  If your ancestors aren't/weren't enrolled, you can't become enrolled.    3) Higher education funding opportunities reserved for American Indians are for enrolled tribal members/citizens of US Federally Recognized Tribes only.  If you're not enrolled, you don't qualify.  If you are enrolled, you still have to compete with other enrolled tribal members for the funds which are limited and are awarded to the top applicants.    Next!|`|AsdGvTA0aa	Um, is the grant money greater than the cost of getting a few DNA tests?|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	Do it!  Plus, it think it would be fun to learn about the culture and the people, maybe it will give you a connection to your heritage.  And if they want to help you pay for college, more power to you.  I know at Fort Lewis College in Durango CO if you are a certain percentage Native American you get a full ride because of the fact that the land the college was built on was seized from Native Americans.|`|Sk148TUCaa	I went to this place and they gave me the tribe I was closest to , made sense because it was the tribe I was thinking

2OBP8fqJaa	I think you are a very compassionate and sensitive person. You seem to want to be decent and moral despite the break-up of your marriage.     What did the court ORDER you to pay and him pay? I think he is taking advantage of this, but I don't know all the factors of your situation. Do you HAVE to give him money? Does he have custody of your children if you have any?     Since you so freely gave everything back before, he doesn't see any harm in asking for more. Don't give him.....one....more....thing.   Do not encourage him calling, by even having a discussion unless you have children. Keep your conversations documented or recorded if you have to, and only discuss WHAT YOU HAVE TO. Don't enable his calling by talking to him!     If you don't protect your boundaries, don't call, no more money, he will continue to harass you. It also very disrespectful to your own husband and family finances. How would you feel if it was your husband giving away the farm to his ex-wife? That would piss me off.    Write him a letter, make it as legal sounding as possible, and tell him to stop calling and harassing you, or you will file a restraining order. Send it certified so you have proof. Get a small digital tape recorder and if he calls, turn it on before you pick up the phone. Say "hello who is this?" ___ex_____ . Tell him to "stop calling" you anymore you are married. And then tell him if he continues you will file a restraining order. Then hang-up. "Click" recorder off. Time and date.  Do you like him calling you? Ask yourself this also.|`|YyVGXt83aa	If you both left the relationship with what you put in then he should be leaving you alone.  He probably is nuts and should seek some help.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I think he is nuts!  Have you thought about getting a restraining order?  That is what I would do.  Also change your phone number.  Hurry up, I can't believe your husband is going to tolerate this for too long.|`|e87cd8e8c653d0f68402573b2d9f3ef1aa	Do NOT get a restraining order.. Unless he is a senseible man .. most men take offence to the orders and it could enrage him.    I suggest you END communication [he's probably heard of your good fortune and thinks you owe him something.. you do not! It would only further communications and harassment]    Change your phone number[s] and only give out to people you trust.. If those people know your ex first make them promise not to give the number to your ex [explaint hat he's harassing you]  If need be.. you could tell him up front in one final message that he's harassing you and if he contacts you once more you will speak to a lawyer or the police not him.  That might/should pump his brakes.    Hopefully he doesn't know where you live.. If so you may need to move or consider it with you're family.  Even the most sensible ex could turn into something horrible if something sets him off.  Be safe and good luck.    PS don't take a chances with you're ex.  I hate to sound rude but.. if the credit card was in his name.. and he took the car.. and you're ring.. and still has them.. than I think he can manage [or already has] with that bill.. It's a grudge but I think he should be more forgiving about it.. Personally i would  have moved on and let it go.. No worth the troubles..  Imagine the fabulous life he must be leading to squeeze harassing you into his busy schedule. I think he's jealous of what you... being happy. Let him stew, he deserves it.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Hello?  How about disconnecting your number or filing a restraining order?  If he feels he can prove it in court - let him try!  You need to cut all contact - stop answering the phone when it's him, put "return to sender" on any mail you receive...don't give in - he'll eventually go away.|`|IXskJPlVaa	Some people do not have morale - he is one of them. Ignore all communications totally - If you don't want to communicate how can anyone do so one sided. No calls, delete mails and msgs without even bothering to read them. You are already in a satisfying marriage - enjoy. Best of luck.|`|7tAH3GEBaa	He's stupid, jealous, and wants you back but cant admit it. Tell to get lost or you will call the police

qrI5ZH42aa	I think the chances he'll be happy to see you when he gets back are pretty good!  :)  Even if he does get in touch with his mate don't fret if you yourself haven't geard from him.  If he smiled when you kissed him, there's no way he reacted badly to it.
3ctchU2faa	If he says he wants to try again sometime, it means he wants to fool around until it gets boring and then he'll have you waiting for him in the wings.  Get out with your friends, go to the movies or to an arcade, go to a dance, join a club, just get out there and don't feel sorry for yourself!  I bet you're going to get out there and realize that he wasn't your everything, just a something to help pass the time.    Listen to some empowering songs, songs that talk about how you don't need him in your life and how you are strong on your own!|`|KjKlytKqaa	go out with some friends, move on,   sorry hun, he aint comming back.|`|9ptIuJ8uaa	Angry girl music is great!

Period.|`|gw88BKXyaa	dont be weak around him show him that you are strong and you are independent, as for the songs, stay sugarland? lol idk i dont listen to much music
6tDFpxUJaa	That's a hard situation that many people find themselves in.  I went through something like that twice in a row and my boyfriend and best friend, sadly, weren't much help.  My roomie on the other hand was a life saver.  Make sure that you're with him when you talk to him about it, not over the phone.  Be there so you can hold him and just sit next to him.  Chances are he'll need someone to be with and you're the number one person he'll want.  While you can't say "I know how you feel" (that's actually one of the worst things you can say), let him know that while you don't know what he's feeling you're there to listen and talk to through it all.  It doesn't matter what time of day, what you're doing or where you are.  Let him know he can always call you or that you can always come over when he needs you.  Let him know that he should call his aunt and talk to her while he can.  He'll regret not talking to her if he doesn't and she passes away.  It's a really sad situation and I hope you can make him feel a little better.|`|YqeatZB4aa	Tell him that you are very sorry for him, that you love him and you want to be there for him. Tell him that she is no longer in any pain that the cancer had to be hurting her in some way and that she is safe now. If he believes in God tell him that she is now watching over him keeping him safe. (That is for when she passes). Also for what you can say to him now is that you are there for him if he needs to talk that you will listen. Sometimes when people are going through something like that (my mom has cancer) they don't really want advice or anything like that they just want someone that will listen to them and hold on to them.|`|YtT9uGOSaa	"I'm so sorry to hear about your aunt "Tommy" and I want you to know that I'm going to be here for you in any way I can be."  You can also offer to go with him to visit his aunt.|`|AA12135516	It's not an easy situation to be in but i think the main thing you can do is to be there for him. Don't even worry about what you are going to say just let him talk & hopefully open up to you & take it from there. People react differently, he might not want to talk, he might prefer to be alone but if he does want to talk & cry then just be there in person for him & give him lots of cuddles & moral support.

I would rather try again to see if we could get it right.|`|OG4410bdaa	throwing away 24 years of marriage all because he had ONE slip up?  no, I think I'd stay with him  I mean, I'd need for us to have some serious marital counseling and maybe re-access how we can make our marriage stronger so that we are no longer at risk for such issues  but so long as he was still commited to me and promised not to do it again then I'm sure we could find a way to work past it    you didn't meantion an STD  having a one-time slip up is one thing  however if my husband brought an STD into our marriage then I think I'd have a much more difficult time forgiving and moving past it....in fact, depending on the STD and how serious it was, I may consider it grounds for divorce|`|f6YsGOynaa	Business in China is about building relationships before actually getting into the heart of business.  Part of building relationships often involves visits to the local massage parlor, KTV, or other places that offer "extra services" often paid for by the Chinese host.  To not accept these services can be considered an insult and can harm a business relationship.      Most of the women that we (judgmental) Americans would consider to be "hookers" are average women, and not the type of street skank portrayed in the American media, and tend to be much more careful about their sexual health.      I figure, if it happens in China, it STAYS in China.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	No|`|scnW0Wzeaa	If I were you I would dump him and get checked out for STDs.|`|n1AAHi5qaa	Hooker???

And I don't curse very often, so that should let you know how strongly I feel about it.

You become one with anyone you have sex with. So you ARE becoming one with everyone they have slept with.

That is a loooong time...therefore you should really think about it. There is alot of factors to consider.

Another thing would be, if it really only happened once, since you do not see him on a daily basis how would you know if he is telling the truth...what about you? Have you ever done something like that? Even though alot of people can give you advice and tell you to leave him or tell you to stay...im staying neutral on this...because in the end whether you stay or leave...YOU are the only one that is going to live with the consequences of you decision.

If he chooses to sleep with a prostitute and wants me to stay with him, it would require intense couples counseling as well as 18 months of NO sex.  I would insist he be screened for STIs every 6 months to make sure he is clean and if he remains clean for 18 months, that would be the only way I'd sleep with him again.    He would have been better off talking to me about taking a partner outside our relationship.  That would be perfectly acceptable with my full knowledge and consent.|`|ZaMzRSrraa	nope- PROBABALLY A DRUGGIE/STD CARRIER|`|OcCgUsmLaa	It wouldn't bother me, because I would be out doing the same thing.

If he is taking an online course he shares with you for men who have sexual addiction, or that kind of an issue, AND if he is going to church and going for counseling himself, there is hope and hang in there.    http://www.settingcaptivesfree.com/home/    If he isn't DOING anything to truly make up for it and change his ways (not just say it with battering eyes and a pleaful sincerity and flowers once in awhile) he will probablly fall into it again with all the crap on the internet. He needs to be accountable to you to prove he can be trusted ESPECIALLY if he is oversees.

zoyw8CRKaa	I think this is where marriages are going wrong now and take one look at the divorce rate, women are trying to be as equal as a man in a marriage, i think in a marriage that you need a decision maker you both cannot fight for that part otherwise it wont work, i am 20 and happily married i see my role old fashioned as it may seem i am the wife my duties involve keeping my husband happy his house tidy and bringing his children up to be good people, he is the provider and i look to him as my carer my support as you may say, if need be then i would do DIY but my husband would take that task on and i certainly have no problems with him doing that when it comes to cooking etc etc he is more than willing to help me out but it is my main role to do those things.<br>  <br>  I don't think marriage is just about teamwork everyone i have spoken to who are happily married and have been for 50 odd years say its more about compromise than anything.|`|HL8PEDFLaa	This is where people like you are constantly proven wrong and often look stupid... Like this moment here. Women don't like to to do the cleaning, but we do it because generally it's more important to us. I do know my way around the tool shed better than most men and so do almost all of my female friends. Marriages don't run into trouble because the woman is tired of being stuck at home so they go on strike so to speak. There are many causes why marriages have rocky spots, but unless the husband is a chauvinistic pig then of course it causes trouble. If your wife is ok with being treated as a second class citizen in her own home then good for you two. But come on now, what decade do you think this is? I'm not saying it's wrong to want a traditional lifestyle, but posting questions like this and making broad assumptions such as women like to clean and should be in the home. Got all that? I understand that someone such as yourself with no education and a God complex might have some difficulty. Good luck!|`|xGshAiXOaa	I don't know where you got your info, but I'm female and I don't like to scrub, clean, and iron.

They feel they have to be a man to be enough, which is really, really sad, and demeaning to women.<br>  <br>  A woman is special and unique, and wonderful in her feminine complexity. Her emotions, desires, thoughts, creativity all make her a mysterious, fascinating being, and each woman should embrace her intrinsic qualities and feel free to enjoy raising children, mothering, and taking care of the family and home if she so desires. It's disgustingly rotten that so many people have been misled to believe that a woman who takes care of the home or raises and trains children is being demeaned. What can be more important than raising the next generation? Women should feel valued if they choose that role, but should be free to pursue a career if they chose.<br>  <br>  Some women are great with tools and maps. It's not what you do that makes you a woman or man; it's who you are. It's in every cell of our bodies. Embrace who you are and rejoice. Don't let others convince you that you aren't enough.|`|AA11630994	Everyones different.<br>  <br>  In my house - we share everything...im scrubbing - he helps me. <br>  And when he's washign the car - i help him.

jRSzIzYqaa	You're gorgeous, but the dark look tends to intimidate guys and makes you seem harder to approach. Why would you even be worried about your weight. You just need to make yourself more approachable. You'll find a guy, don't despair.|`|SGjhNidDaa	you should be what you want to be, and who you are.<br>  But from what i've seen, guys go for the flirty types of girls who look cute and are generally "light". so maybe try switching to more feminine, lighter and more feminine colors, and perhaps either dye the hair or grow it out.|`|d8yrvK4waa	You look fine to me<br>  <br>  SteveC|`|eYuIsNk1aa	The pic for your avatar is not bad the others on your album though your make up is very harsh looking, but let you hair down some & maybe let it go longer  short hair make a guy think "lesbian vegetarian"<br>  maybe wear some girly jewelery too.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	20 year old? into photography and art?, whats not hot about you? maybe these guys are taking the time to realize how different you are. Its always harder when you go outside the norm, unfortunately.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	glasses look good but you need a new and modern hairdo...|`|AA10743159	I don't think you need to worry about your looks, as you certainly are pretty enough, for any guy.<br>  Yes, you are twenty, and should be more adult, but, I see, just some minor changes are needed.<br>  I don't care for piercings, and many other guys, don't either, But that being said, I'm sure there are just as many who do like it.<br>  I'm no girl, so I have no idea, what you can do with your hair, as it looks fine to me.<br>  I'm sure you have dozens of fashion magazines, you can study. Or ask around some of your girlfriends, for some recent magazines. Look at the pictures, of Celebs or models, that have a hair style you may like, or clothes, that you think would work well with you. Then cut them out and set them aside.<br>  After you have gather several of them, take a look and see what they all have in common, this should give you a sense of what your style is.<br>  I also get the feeling, you are confused about who or what you are, and this may put some guys off. Once you have made up your mind, whether to focus on school, or career, then you will appear more confident, and ergo, more appealing to guys.<br>  Hey be flirty with guys, it needn't be serious, just fun, and good practice. I think, that sure will help you getting those guys asking you out.<br>  And lets face it, if you have had a certain look for a while, it may be time for a change, which could do wonders for your own self esteem.|`|tG1vTi0Daa	Hmm I like you the way you are. You dont have to change a thing. You would look good with long hair too, so maybe give that a try. Otherwise, maybe find some selfconfidence. Guys notice when you arent comfortable in your own skin. But they do notcie a girl whos confident, no matter how she looks.|`|ELSKfMpxaa	I think it's more the hair style that makes you look like a les... I love the color and there is nothing wrong with your face or your piercings. I think you're very pretty. Maybe you should be more outgoing.. Guys like girls that show confidence.|`|YFXusnT1aa	To punky go with a shorter cut, you should be good. Try using darker lipstick|`|2KC467tFaa	I like your style. It's unique. I've always wanted to have more of an individual style. Instead of changing that (unless YOU don't like it), try changing the impression you give off. You seem like a really awesome, artsy, open-minded person. As great of a friend I think you would be, I would be too intimidated to approach you. Smile more. Laugh, talk, and show that you're not unapproachable. People are always afraid of being humiliated and turned down. They find it easier to avoid the situation than to take a chance. You will find a guy who likes you for who you are. I looked horrible when my husband met me. We worked together, and my uniform consisted of huge T-shirts (sleeveless wasn't allowed), jeans, tennis shoes, and a crappy vest. My hair was always pulled back and make-up was almost nonexistent. I thought it was hilarious that he thought it was cute. He told me later that at first he was afraid to talk to me because I never seemed to smile. I was also completely miserable at this job. I was always nice to everyone and never made demands (return desk... they had to put back their returns). After he saw my personality, he asked me out. We married 3 months later. Personality shows through style. Just allow people to feel comfortable approaching you without giving up your individuality.|`|8o1ZdCkuaa	I personally think that you are very, very pretty.  I think the issue is not your looks or your weight at all, but rather what you emanate to others.  Just from looking at your pictures and your artwork, I get the impression that you are very smart, a deep thinker and very intense.  Even if that is not who you are, that is the vibe that I get from you.  I also get that you could be perceived as being unapproachable.  So, I'm thinking that maybe guys feel a little intimidated by you. I'm certainly not saying to dumb yourself down or anything but maybe you could look to lighten-up a bit.  Lighten up your aura.  Don't take life so seriously all the time.  Smile more and laugh more.  I'm not saying to change who you are at all or to conform to something you're not.  I'm just trying to say you should maybe be more open.  Don't be insecure.  Being insecure could also be misinterpreted as being standoffish.  If you learn to love yourself and to be open, then a great guy will come along.  I hope this helped.  Good luck.|`|XdUL0PXmaa	Well, I think you're very pretty! But guys can just be awful sometimes, not reading even the most obvious of signs, so I wouldn't assume it's anything wrong on your behalf. Weight-wise, you look nicely slim, your hair, is cute, maybe grow it out a bit, but that's my opinion, and although that's what you're asking for, you really should just do what _you_ want, because it's just more attractive to be with someone that likes how they are (well, most of the time) than someone who's crawled into themself because an idiot called them a lesbian vegetable!! What is up with that anyway, only douchebags can think up comments like that. Ignore them!<br>   Sorry, off track - keep what you like about yourself, and maybe go to a hairdressers and ask for a style that will compliment your face shape and colouring - they know those sorts of things! And maybe notch up the flirting, not in your face, just a little less subtle.<br>   Wow, awful advice, I'm sorry, but good luck anyway!|`|wFN8bVqsaa	I think you have a great style and are very beautiful. I think that guys our age (i am 22) are so immature. Plus, many are really shy. I wouldn't worry too much about not having a boyfriend yet, it will come with time. I found that my freshman and sophomore years in college, guys were just immature and looking for hookups. Later on guys seemed to mature a bit. Personally, I think too many piercings and too much of a hipster look is a bit of a turn off to guys (unless they are really into that), but I think you have a good balance. Don't change who you are, someone will come around when you aren't expecting it :)|`|sM5W2jPjaa	I think u luk awesome. if ur trying to meet a guy, the perfect guy should like u the way u r. please don't make anything with ur hair that's ur best feature. don't change ur personality to show someone that you're a good person. if that person really likes he wouldn't judge that|`|bIjI8BTBaa	the close up pictures with the glasses on are so nice :)<br>  <br>  whatever look you did there id go for that, im sure guys would like it cause you seemed confident :))|`|6GVV71auaa	grow out your hair were lighter makeup wrong style of clothes for that pretty face of your and you can get a fitness trainer to tell you about your wait honestly I think you could drop 7 lbs|`|hVdAgEWhaa	to punkish.|`|HeSCyy7paa	i think you're perfect like that<br>  <br>  i like your style|`|MjGE0x9jaa	Dude, i think ur like me lack of confidence in urself im also fairly good looking or so ive heard from time to time but a little word for wise some guys do not read signs girls give them and if u truely love the way u are never change urself especially just for a love relationship or w/e becuz that stuff is so sketchy and not worth going outside of who are to get one A LOT  of pain down that road so i suggest just waiting for the right person to come along that will accept u at least ull be comfortable on the ride down right?
xGshAiXOaa	I let mine.  He likes to, so why not?  The fact that he's shaving me isn't a turn on, but the fact that it turns him on turns me on.  Plus, he usually does more than just shaving.

NuUdCz0Laa	Sounds like a controlling a**hole.  There is not a logical reason for him not to want you to do something for yourself.  Tell him to grow up and if he does not allow you to do what you desire, while he is asleep you will pierce his penis.  That should get his attention.  Good luck.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	while they are attached to your body, they are more for his pleasure than anything. So if you change them into something that he's not attracted to, then he won't show any attention to them anymore. And he will probaly want to see porn boobies over yours, because yours now have wholes in them, and jewlery hanging from them. it's really ugly.|`|AA11603468	Why do you want them?

Anytime the nipple ring touches my clothes i instantly get a *****.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Ok...I'll assume this a real question.    I have friends who went for piercings,and there are drawbacks.  The skin will develop scar tissue that in the long run reduce sensitivity.  It also might make it impossible to nurse, if you haven't done babies yet.  And last, they show...and send a message about you that he might be uncomfortable with.    May I suggest you google it online?  After you see the pics, you might decide its not so erotic.|`|RQrFOF14aa	In your case do what you want to.|`|rLP9wjPtaa	It sounds cool to me.

TOO HONEST which leads us to #4<br>  ===============================<br>  <br>  4) The only problem, and only thing I can help you with, is that girls at ANY AGE don't like to be directly told that you like them. AND EVEN IF they like it, they'll think weirdly of you, and think they're above you... then they won't WANT you, as you'll be too easy.<br>  <br>  YOU NEED TO STOP TELLING GIRLS UP-FRONT THAT YOU LIKE THEM.<br>  <br>  instead, talk to them, flirt with them, look them in the eyes, smile, put ur arms aruond them or hold their hand, make fun of them if its funny and itll make others laugh (this makes them see u as a challenge.. which makes them want u even more), etc.<br>  <br>  If you do THIS, they will start to like you more.  <br>  <br>  Once that happens, sure go ahead- ask them for their #, call them a COUPLE days later and say ur not busy and if they wanted to do anything... etc. but DONT act needy or clingy... DONT tell them up-front that you like them (as they like challenges)... etc.!|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	Well the only common denominator is you.  So there is something about you that is holding you back and keeping you from what you want.<br>  <br>  why doesn't it work out?  Do you get the chance to have any type of relationship with them beyond friends or do they just tell you "no thanks, I just want to be friends?"<br>  <br>  Start asking those female friends who say you can do better, how you can do better.  Ask them to be honest with you and to see in what way you are off putting to someone you are attracted to.  If you're still friends with the ones who rejected you then start there.  Tell them to be honest--tell them you always run into this problem and you want to know how to change it for the future.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|B9jH3GJRaa	i want to see a pic of you ;)

ckLlUQfMaa	You dad probably has had something very troubling happen and you just happend to be in the right (Wrong) place at the right (wrong) time and got to suffer the consequences.     When he is calm have a sit down and talk with him about this. Ask him why he's stressing and maybe you can help to relive it just by talking or in some other way

IbhX8kHxaa	I prefer a poofy dress because you can wear a white slim dress to any elegant event but the big puffy white dress you only get to wear once!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	slim and understated.  if a girl over 30 tries to wear a big poofy gown with the petticoats underneath, it looks like she's trying to be younger than she is.  those gowns are for young brides but a more understated style is in order for girls over 30 IMHO.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	I like A-line. It's between poofy and slim... It's more flattering on my body.|`|3SSVBJAqaa	I am going for a style in the middle. This is going to be my dress:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dragonorient.com/product.php?productid=17178&cat=367&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.dragonorient.com/product.php?...</a>|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Slim style - I'm not a poofy type of gal!  I just think the slim style dresses never go out of fashion, they always look nice, classic, elegant.|`|AA11380378	Slim. It's more sophisticated.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|GvamTVqAaa	mine was slim|`|ZfleGhXLaa	This really, really depends on who is wearing it.  The majority of body types are not going to be able to pull off, but on some people with the right type of body they look really amazing.  On my body I would prefer something with more shape, but not really too much "poof" Like, a nice a-line shape.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	For my body type, I went with a slim style (Mermaid).  It looked better on me than any of the "poofy" ones and it was very vintage looking....at least the dress I got was.  <br>  <br>  But for some women, the "poofy" looks fabulous on them while the slim styles make them look like a stuffed sausage.  It is all about what looks best on the bride....and each bride is different.|`|Qgg6i6K7aa	I love the poofy ones. <br>  I bought an A-line but wanted it more poofy so I wore two crinoline's.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	I like A line..or mermaid..<br>  <br>  I realized they are most flattering for my body..<br>  <br>  it all depends on your body...sometimes we end up getting we never imagine wearing...|`|ztb1F35Xaa	I prefer slim..... i like simple dresses....not with beading and lace everywhere....slimer is more elegant in my opinion|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	Slim style. <br>  I've never liked the poofy look. Why do you want to look 30 pounds bigger?|`|iKYNUni0aa	poofy|`|sGP6s7uraa	Slim... but it depends on the girl.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Depends on the body type. For my wedding dress I wanted formal so I went with a-line. I personally can wear either a-line or sheath or ballroom or mermaid or trumpet and it works. However for my wedding I wanted a dress that would put me outside the realm of cocktail parties and into the wedding, which for me was a fuller skirt. I attend galas and balls quite often and prefer to save the closer-fitting, less formal styles for those events. I did try on dresses in all styles though. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|faMya3HHaa	For a wedding dress something more slim, not as poofy as a ball gown but a bit of flare to add a hint of drama and movement. My dress is designed slim but I am short and am wearing an added skirt underneath to make it flare out slightly, this makes it the perfect length and makes it more unique looking|`|BNNzCqhIaa	It all depends on body type. I personally think slimmer wedding dresses are more sexy and sophisticated with poofy ones tend to be a little over the top and overly 'snow princess' It all depends on what you are going for you can do both right.|`|qKbwBYRTaa	Poofy A-line<br>  <br>  Like this but in white:<br>  <a href="http://www.justinalexanderbridal.com/us_en/collection_popup.php?id=773&disc=&curimage=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.justinalexanderbridal.com/us_...</a>|`|239548019a89f1b3358d72761eef3170aa	my dress was poofy because i am short, but if you are thin you can wear what ever you like, plus I knew my husband wanted to see a princess so I was one!|`|f547b0547924b21590b8ffb102004fdeaa	Poofy (but not ridiculously poofy). Slim looks too much like a sexy evening gown to me. I'd rather have a romantic, fairy tale look for my wedding day.|`|h836dd9qaa	Somewhere in the middle. Not to slim, but not hugely poofy so when I'm  dancing or have to turn around I'm not knocking people over|`|L0Gwa10paa	we can have in mind the sort of dress we want but once you arrive at the store your mind can change when you see "that dress"|`|Chib4b8saa	Slim is very pretty on a slender person; with just a simple train behind it. Poofy is too; well just that..poofy!|`|sLwmzvi8aa	i like poofy... but my best friend likes slim... so its all up to you and what dress you fall in love with|`|9edd25b37861246574ffa754e91a83daaa	Slim style because it will show you off more.|`|v7ZmPEwOaa	depends. do you want to be a princess (poof) or sexy(slim) ?|`|BXQUl2zwaa	poofy .... like a ballroom dress :)|`|f2RpmfFOaa	a line
b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	False. When you are truly in love with someone, you won't cheat on them. I know from experience.|`|R8U1m7uvaa	like the first person said, it really depends, i cheated on my boyfriend whenever we first dated, we broke up a few times and then i promised I would stay true, we have been together 2 and a half years now, and I would never hurt him in that way ever again|`|dd98vPqxaa	Well i think that  may be true..............................<br>   it would also depend on the person......................<br>               As you said it depends if the person is really in love.<br>               If you are really love your partner you wont disrespect.!!!!!|`|jiOuUDLTaa	Absolutely false<br>  ive made the mistake of cheating on the love of my life and i would never do it again|`|6kgin3FJaa	In my life experience - always a cheater.|`|yb01tlviaa	totally true|`|wZSMDrCfaa	It is absolutely true...No Ifs, Ands, or Buts!|`|mtOVRAnbaa	If they want to change they def. can..|`|38432188076da24bd2e484fa5d428e24aa	depends on the person|`|I40iBJdHaa	absolutely false! i am proof right here!|`|AA11097612	I know that it is false but it is rare for someone to change that habit.  Sometimes, if the cheater is lucky, they will realize that all of the pain that they have put their partner through is not worth the fleeting pleasure of unfaithfulness.  Hopefully they will learn that they will not find what they are looking for in someone else's arms that they can't find at home.  <br>  <br>  This doesn't mean that they can save their relationship but it will help them not to blow the next relationship that they have.|`|eYuIsNk1aa	true every time!!!!!!!!!|`|e98RKB35aa	True people do change but most don't really. It all depends on the person really.|`|M63kq3AYaa	Cheats don't love anyone but themselves, so how can they change if they can't fall in love with "the right person"?
LxvA4vGpaa	If he is asking because he simply wants to hear me say it, then it is always something along the lines of "I love you more than you know" or "Of course I love you, how could I not love such a wonderful, caring amazing man?" <br>  <br>  If he is asking because he is seriously doubting my love then I may answer differently. I may question why he is having doubts and inquire as to what I am doing, or not doing, to make him think I don't.|`|DjLFiZEwaa	Bunches and bunches and bunches......|`|b552f8c9544b98d905c574a9b981e2c4aa	Answer "with the intensity of a thousand suns."|`|gjaPNWbTaa	It would depend on the tone with which the question was asked.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	Sometimes it's just nice to hear.<br>  <br>  I would say, "Of course I love you. I think you're wonderful."|`|yhEDUN6qaa	"Very much"|`|5sIA8oYAaa	My suggestion would be yes I do and it had better be the truth.|`|ADP9swbMaa	"You know I do! I love you like THIIIIIIIIS much (spreading my arms apart as far as I can)!"|`|W2RaqfWOaa	My fiance and I say that we love each other out of the blue, or if we want the other one to know we want to get off the phone, or to shut up so we can go to sleep.  But we always respond "I love you" so If I think hes asleep and I want to check b4 I ask him something I say " I love you" and if he doesnt respond I know he's asleep|`|CF1R0TPvaa	My wife has never asked that question.  Probably because I'm always drooling over her anyway and she's sick of it.  <br>  <br>  When I have asked her, she says "yes"  and then stops talking.  I usually ask her after being rejected for sex for the 10,753rd time, just to make sure I'm getting rejected for other reasons besides lack of love.|`|oGo4ftFMaa	I would say "Yes, more now than ever babe, even more than you love me"<br>  He thinks he loves me more.<br>  <br>  Edit: He would never ask that though, we both know we love each other, for better or worse, no matter what.<br>  <br>  We tell each other we love one another daily, arguing or not. well over a hundred times a day.|`|B7kPUmUWaa	My husband doesn't ask me that. But if he did, I would say yes and then ask him why he felt the need to ask me that. Find out if your partner is insecure or if you might have made them feel like they needed to ask that for some reason.|`|agNhphW6aa	Mine for some reason asks that a lot too.  I think it's an insecurity where they constantly have to be reminded,<br>  my reply is<br>  <br>  based on how i treat you, what do you think?|`|xGshAiXOaa	I would probably say something sarcastic along the lines of duh, sometimes, or just your extremities, etc.  That's just who I am, he knows he doesn't have to ask if I love him.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	I say, of course I do. We ask each other this daily just as a playful thing. It's nice to hear.|`|g4QFDU6paa	"You don't know already?"|`|fc1n9vBjaa	I'd say yes then give her a kiss on the forehead.|`|ZRityMV8aa	what an insecure question.|`|MuVKeK8faa	I always answer in a goofy way!|`|jBigEy0Caa	I'd probably say "I guess so", but I'm a little on the sarcastic side.  He knows I love him.|`|eWMn7dhKaa	Siempre.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	He doesn't ask; but if a situation called for him asking this question right now, I would say yes.<br>  <br>  However, a situation that might make asking this question necessary to begin with might very well result in a "no" answer.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	If you are in love, why would he/she ask that?|`|FtyLwqR5aa	I think that I show him in so many different ways and tell him so much that he rarely asks me this question, But if he were to ask me this I would feel as if he wasn't feeling that he was loved to much so I guess i would stop grab him in a hug and tell him that Yes I Love you Babylove.|`|GvamTVqAaa	I would say "yes"|`|y9CgveCGaa	I say yes.  Then I hug her and kiss her.|`|bO2rzfISaa	He's not whiny and needy, so he doesn't ask that.

That is the right thing to do.|`|xmzvUFR3aa	If you tell, she'll be upset with you, but it'll be the right decision in the long run. You have to really sit back and think about the situation and decide what's most important. If you tell,it may cause her to not talk to you,but she'll eventually get over it. If you don't tell, the situation may get worse and her mom may really hurt her and you'll regret not telling. Take those two things into consideration and decide which one you can live with. good luck!!!!|`|2d8879147618190440919438922e8a7eaa	I went through a similar situation when I was in middle school except I was your friend.  My friend went to the counselor and told what I had shared with her about my mom beating the crap out of me.  I was mad at her for telling simply because I knew I would not be taken from my mom the same night that social services came to talk to her, and the situation would only get worse.  I swore up and down that I was just making it all up to get attention from my friend.  I don't know if the believed me, but the school has an obligation to report that to social services and did so.  When the social worker arrived at my home, I swore up and down it was all just a misunderstanding.  Looking back, I wish I were brave enough to have told the truth, it could have stopped a lot of what happened to me.  Every year it just kept getting worse.  I wish now, I could thank my friend for doing what she did.  So, I would talk to your friend and make her understand that she needs to do something now, before worse happens.  She may be afraid of her mother getting angry and beating her worse than ever, but if she has the school and social services on her side, than she can get help.  Social services may take her from her home, but keep in mind it is only temp.  long as her mother gets help.  If she doesn't agree, I would go to the counselor and tell her what your friend has told you.  Your friend may hate you, but it is what is best for her.|`|TPBfzLqjaa	Tell. Your friend will Thank you later.
eSzY7OIHaa	Sorry about your mum. Hopefully she will get better.  Not easy I know.    I agree, you need to remain calm, and just concentrate on what you've got to do, without panicking.   Be strong. And determined.  You WILL get through this.    To help you cope, I suggest you find your local youth counselling service and drop in there for a chat.  In UK, this service is great:  http://www.connexions-direct.com/|`|n8nhjmfraa	just relax and deal with one thing at a time. things will get better and easier with time.|`|3GG5Lx7zaa	It's impossible for anyone to go through all of this smoothly.  You need to talk to a counselor or someone close to get all this out your system.  You need to take things one day at a time cause you'll end up losing it yourself. Make a list of things your dealing with and eliminate things you dont need in your life. for example: the unhelpful boyfriend. (its easier to get rid of him and have no help than for him to be around and expect help from him that your not getting anyway).
4ZGriYvGaa	think positive and hope for the best.    take some time out for yourself to get your mind off things.     go out and have fun, it will make you feel better
tCiVuFK9aa	I know what you mean, my husband says that all the time. What is it that makes them think that something is wrong.  I always say to my husband "Why do you think something is wrong" When he tells me then I can address that. Like once he said that I was extra quiet.  So I told him the truth, that I was tried and thinking about somethings at work.  And once I told him that I was really interested in the movie I was watching and that his talking was interrupting.  <br>  Red|`|AjFA8qIxaa	Why does he text you to call him?shouldnt he be calling you? Sounds like he's insecure. Nexttime he does it, just tell him ( calmy) that nothing is goinf on and he needs to stop asking, its going on your merves and makes him sound whiny. <br>  If he gets mad, tell him you will hang up now, and he can call you back when he calmed down.<br>  remember, you didnt do anything to get treated like that.|`|oojO4WAraa	Next time he calls and you are relaxing, watching TV, or don't want to talk - tell him.

VSVQHKwKaa	What is happening to you:    Kinda cuts through all the feminism doesn't it? The truth is, most women, on some level, are very much attracted to a strong, confident, dominant male. Domination frees a person from guilt, repression, disinclination, and fear. It is very securing, safe, and calming to take orders, rather than have to figure out every emotional turn for yourself.    Under such leadership, many women find the safety and security (and attention) required to express their femininity.     And this is what your addiction is based on: He makes you feel like a beautiful WOMAN. Not a beautiful person, a beautiful student, a beautiful individual ect ect....a beautiful WOMAN!    You've long been searching for HOW to feel right about your feminity. You feel attraction towards this man because, with his strength and protection, you're unafraid to show your vulnerability, your emotions, and your needs. You no longer fear rejection.    What you should do:    Unfortunately, you've found this wonderful formula (that I think you can and SHOULD duplicate in the future) with a man who is too many years your elder.     Feasably, this relationship has an experation date. You're not going to marry this man (as you already know) and run a signficant risk of bearing one of his children (which you need to be worried about).     You are going to have to face the fact that there is no future with this man. Worse, he is a friend of your father's. It won't be much longer before your father finds out about the two of you and (hopefully) has this lover of yours killed.     So this relationship was fun and instructive, but it needs to end.    As for the future: you need to find a younger, more suitable man who can invoke these same feelings of safety and security....a man who is competent and cablable of being in charge....to make your husband.     I have no doubt that your are more than capable of finding this man.     In the forseeable future, however, I would refrain from drinking and sitting in men's laps. Your liason with this family friend may have been fun, but it could quickly become detrimental and even dangerous.    So, you've learned a few things. Now take that knowledge, apply it in your life, do the responsible thing, and quit relationship post-haste.    Time to grow up and be a big girl. But now you know what you're looking for....    ...and know it far better than your friends and peers. Imagine how little THEY understand about the depths of their femininity. How unfortunate that today's sissy boys give them so little room to exercise it.     Good Luck!|`|CuGAYMlbaa	sweetie your fine you found a man that is making you realize that you are a woman now it is ok to like a man being in control just relax and accept that your a good girl and he is making you happy|`|ee16bd6fa8f2d93667b5d5f76c2e7c8caa	For many women, we are raised to believe that sex can only be associated with love and marriage. By submitting to a dominant man, we allow ourselves to be sexual by telling ourselves that we are still being good girls and obeying. It is exciting. Just try to stay grounded and realize that this is just sex.|`|7d65453e3d628e90746acdacb5c61c16aa	this is posted in the wrong area...in fact, I don't think YA has an "erotic stories" section. LOL...obviously you enjoy the attention...if you don't like it, leave him alone.|`|f6YsGOynaa	You've discovered your submissive side.  Before you go any further in this relationship, you need to sit down with this gentleman and discuss the rules of engagement.  In any good Dominant/submissive relationship, there are still lots of boundaries.  Do an Internet search and learn about the three main tenets of D/s which are "sane, safe, and consensual" and learn about "safe words" and don't be afraid to end a relationship where your boundaries are not respected.|`|l1KlZrAOaa	You're just a sex toy to him!

How would you feel seeing him with someone else? How would he feel?  I think it might be a recipe for disaster.

VAI6MtPIaa	I'm with a great guy now.. but the guy before him was a nightmare!    He tried to control how I dressed, what I ate and who I talked to. He didn't want me to go anywhere that a guy could be at (including my job and college). He'd get upset when I would discuss things on the phone with my sister or mother and wouldn't let him listen (even when it had nothing to do with him). I kept getting asked to add more people in our relationship.. more females. He believed he was a "master" and I was a pet of his (even though I told him I'm not into that bs). Yes, he could still do whatever he wanted, talk to whoever he wanted and the moment I said anything about it.. he'd try to talk down to me.     Red flags were up from day one.. he was married and about to go through a divorce.    I tried to break things off with him in the first month then he kept begging me to go back to him stating that he'd change. After about 2 months we broke up but he kept messing with me. I haven't heard anything from him after Christmas-THANK GOD! (I was with him in June and July of 2008, that's it).|`|ckjZnqHRaa	...she was way too busy out two timing me with some other guy behind my back unwittingly...why else really?  If she wanted open dating..I would have been acceptable to that idea maybe....  ...otherwise I would have stayed with her for the exclusive relationship SHE demanded!.  I didn't know she was gonna be like this seriously.  Seemingly I feel post relationship foolish of course....but really she was the fool.  Even her two timing guy dumped her recently.  She was cheating behind his back too...LOL...go figure!  All I can say is"WOW!!!"|`|ZH1IE8kLaa	He cheated on me. plain and simple. and then he lied about it.. yeah.. he was gone after that.|`|3OFwqCL4aa	she was to immature|`|7ed480a52bc6c7d8ee0116746d0fb4f9aa	All we did was makeout when we hung out. there was no connection|`|GV8h48Wqaa	we drifted apart and hardly even spoke anymore  we both new it was time to end it|`|oVGuvb0zaa	He mainly wanted sex.|`|4q7yhoSPaa	he didn't appreciate me.|`|TLEMMWSBaa	Well....

Tear*|`|hz8qm7XJaa	Well, we lived 6 hours away, and saw eachother once a month, if we were lucky. We just got sick of it, and agreed to break up. And between you and me, I think he was gay or bi-sexual at the very least.|`|qEH9dbT9aa	he was sick. it was too intense and you all knew what happened. and that was when we were in middle school.|`|oHNacSRxaa	she left me because i was black.  her father didnt like that|`|FigWzRMdaa	He slept with another girl in my bed!!|`|3ctchU2faa	Said he needed space after his father passed away, then we kind of got back together for a few weeks, then I found he was using me for pity sex.

QvDXceDMaa	tell your step mom that you will not tolerate her prejudices. your dad is right about not getting into the middle of it, but there's always a line that can be crossed...|`|MBknatYtaa	You are in the middle of it.

It is none of hers or anyone else's business.|`|lGS1zOd6aa	tell her if she saying this out loud so you can tell your mom|`|QieRAMLkaa	tell her  you have no right to judge my mother  no offence your overstepping your boundaries, you are not my mother and you hurt my feelings saying such things.  I don't want to fight with you but you need to respect me in order to get respect and right now you are not respecting me and my family so kindly back off the subject and we can be good.|`|0udjgaoBaa	Dont get in the middle is the truth...But if she doesn't want to stop talking crap about your mom in front of you then talk crap about her in front of your friends. When she questions you about it then tell her now you know how it feels.|`|B0ypUuHXaa	If she's complaining about your mum sending you to live with your dad and her, ask if she wants you there. If she says, of course I want you to live her, say, well, without my mum, I wouldn't be here, so shut the **** up you ****.|`|Byz59nRGaa	You should talk to your Dad again and ask him to tell her at least that if your step mom has anything to say about your mom, he'd appreciate if she told him about it and not discuss your mom with anyone else because he has to take care of you and your step mom doing this is hurting you since you love your mom and there is nothing she, you or your dad can do about what your mom does and if there is, that it is his responsibility to chose the time and place to discuss these things with your mom, not your step moms.  He could say that he appreciates your step-mom's comments because they help him to make better decisions, but when it comes to you-his son or your mom, HE is the one to make the comments to you or others regarding you and your mom.  Your step-mom's role in the family is to love him and you and take care of your family (your dad, you and your step-mom) within the limits of your family life.  Tell you step- mom that you like her and really appreciate everything she does for you but it makes you feel really bad when she talks about your mom that way, that it makes you feel like you have to choose between her and your mom and you get really confused and sad and feel like your step mom doesn't like you at all.  Good luck, take care and be Happy!

AA11596133	She CAN if you are not paying attention and keeping records of everything you send her. She CAN file for child support,she HAS to do this through the district attorney, BUT, you can turn around and DEMAND a paternity test before ANY money will be awarded.  You will have to pay for the test yourself, but if it turns out negative, you CAN demand she reimburse you for everything.    I KNOW this, because it happened to us.  Keep detailed records, and ASSUME nothing.  If in doubt, consult a lawyer - it is WELL worth it.|`|W76VDFKCaa	I would like to commend you on wanting you see your daughter and taking care of her like a real father.  Do not get discouraged.  Child support/custody laws vary from state to state so you may want to check into your states department of social services to see what services they can offer.  The process may take a little longer but it will be cheaper than going through a lawyer or getting a DNA test on your own.  In my state, if a man takes a DNA test (if you go through the state )and he is NOT the father, he does not have to pay for the test.  And if he IS the childs father, then it only cost about $300.  To pay for a DNA test on your own is about $800.  Also, I don't think you will have to pay back child support since you were not ordered to pay in the first place. In my state, my daughters father was only required to pay back child support from the date I filed for the support.  Good Luck!!!
lFOkhDseaa	Strange question...I think you determine your own success.  I am a single mom of two and I am getting my degree online.  I have been a good example to them in my determination.  I tell them that I did it the wrong way by not going to college out of high school but they see my example and I know they are better people from it.|`|AA11180444	I know in my case, my husband was in a job that seemed to go no where but he stayed there because our children needed the insurance. Once you change to another job, no insurance for some time.  Being sucessful usually devotes alot of time at work.  Children make a difference in decisions as far as a job goes, like taking a job with more hours (less time at home), jobs that will work around a daycare schedule.  It can have a huge impact on the parents decision to be sucessful.  It not only works that way with one parent but both.  Who'd be home with the kids? We all get faced with the decision, which is more important, money (sucess) or family.|`|RBQrgByeaa	Well, if your kid is Hannah Montana or something, lol.     There are studies thats suggest married people live longer. You'd figure most married people have kids.

fJ7E43kWaa	Don't do anything until you're sure, and don't make any decisions until your friend is single. Don't ruin your relationship or your friend's for something that might not be worth it.
xr9C8dktaa	First of all, i'm sorry your in this situation!  It's awful liking someone youre not sure likes you back.     My advice is to just ask her! It sounds like maybe she would be willing to try it so maybe you should just tell her how you feel. Let her know that if the feelings are not reciprocal that you still want to be friends and that it will be better bc now you know you two could never be together. But if she does like you back, assure her that she is ok and that you will treat her great and show her the way. You'll be patient with her, bc shes probably just very nervous as to how to go about being with a woman.     Just tell the truth to her and you will get your answers from there. Good luck!|`|iOI2RT6maa	You sound way too into it to just let it go.    Go for it.|`|MQ1QVNXbaa	I had a lesbian friend named staci. And I knew she liked girls but NEVER in a million years thought she would like me. I am straight, but sometimes when i would go to parties and get even a little drunk I would always want to make out with someone. And society is saying its OK for girls to make out with other girls whether they are straight or not. This isn't fair for lesbians/bisexuals because it can be very confusing for them. I never realized this until i made out with my best friend at a new years party last year. I just did it because i was drunk and guys were around and i guess i wan trying to show off or something.. idk. But she thought I liked her more than a friend and i didn't at all. It hurt her feelings and sort of creeped me out a little. So we don't talk anymore..    So if she is anything like me.. she's just having fun with you and she thinks you know that. Don't get too attached to her.
34LCJyLBaa	i say that u keep talking to ur best friend..but make it clear to him that u dont see him more than friends..be as honest and sweet as u can..<br>  tell him that u just want to keep him as a good friend because usually when a couple breaks up they dont talk anymore and u dont want that..<br>  hopefully he'll understand well he has to understand|`|cn49BbRiaa	I have a guy friend too and he is acting the same way. I dont like him like that I like him as a friend. If you dont care for him in that way you need to let him know it will hurt his feelings and he may even stop being your friend but its the best thing to do.
9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? I think there are different types of love and some of us fall for the wrong person, so we can learn.. but I do think there is "the one". For example I have loved people in my past (live and learn type stuff)... I did love them, but until I found "the one" which I'm married to know, I didn't have that kind of love, but didn't know it at the time...
znngp3E0aa	So if I had a random day with a random guy and did some stuff, but didn't have sex with him...then I didn't cheat on my exboyfriend?    SWEET!    Not that it matters now anyway. Well, to answer your question..I would say (with the way you defined cheating) maybe 20 to 30%|`|bVROvLNSaa	To get the best answer to this question,  you would have to define "cheating".
a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Now would be good. My fiance and I have never had a really heated argument and if we did it wouldn't last long.

Personally, I can't function correctly in the other areas of my life if I had a huge fight with someone close to me (whether it's a significant other, family member, or really close friend) I need it sorted out right away. But not everyone is like me.|`|AA10378447	I say give it a few hours for you both to calm down.

uGFzzLYWaa	Absolutely.    My last relationship was back in the summer of 2005. I have not been in a relationship since, nor have I dated, casually or otherwise.    I find it very hard to trust and love, thanks to my ex, I have no desire to get close to anyone, either.    I hope that will change in the future, I'm getting a little too old to be reckless with my heart. I figure I have one good heartbreak left before commiting emotional suicide.|`|DZB0WCmmaa	of course, there will be few people who would say no, without lying. no, I don't find it hard to trust, not more than usual. At least not because of the relationship|`|rDsKB0uXaa	no men suck and i don't let it get to me mostly because im to young to date    well not really im a teen|`|aOjMf5SPaa	I had a terrible relationship - but I learnt from it, I am still friends with the guy even though I either want to slap him or have sex with him. It does not effect my further relationships. You cant carry on with baggage, it only slows you down.|`|el8yX5q3aa	Everyone is at some point in your life.      Yes you can learn to trust again....you have to realize that not everyone is the same and  to not give them that trust is putting that relationship on hold before it begins.  HOW can you possibly work at a relationship if half of it isn't there?  I am not saying to be stupid and not be aware and question things if they seem funny...that isn't lack of trust..that is perception!    If you continue to have trust issues...then you are not ready for another relationship.  If it was a serious one...you really should not get involved and have a rebound one...they always fail and compound the issues.  WAIT for a few months to get yourself together and think things out ...then you will be ready.    You learn something from every person you have in your life.  Good or bad...there is a lesson...and that is what makes you who you are and who you will be.  Take those gifts and make them work for you...in a positive way.    And Laura....you can get out of the relationship if it is harming you.  YOU ARE GIVING HIM POWER over you and why would you lose yourself in someone so totally you are lost? Why would you do that yourself.  YOU are the most important person in the world.....YOU!  NOT HIM...he doesn't think you are...so YOU BETTER THINK YOU ARE!    It hurts...but it doesn't last forever...and you will be happier in th end.  You will never find your true knight in shining armor until you are free of that idiot that does not appreciate you.    The heart is an amazing thing.  It can take as much love and heartache as you allow.  IT heals and it grows...but to not risk is childish...you are missing out on great love!|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	everyone has been hurt in the past, it would be hard to find someone who wasn't.but u can't judge a new love by a past love, or u will destroy it. hurt in relationships happen, its a way of life. but u have to put the past where it belongs, and go on with life. don't let the past ruin the future.|`|IfwpibHqaa	YEP it hurts but life goes on i say|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	No, i've never been in a relationship.|`|UmpJ0UCfaa	yes. im still with the guy because he helps me. but yea i hardly trust him anymore. once trust is broken its very hard to ever trust again.|`|Zyfm8vnnaa	yuppp|`|eu3Gi5BNaa	HECK YES!  my ex gf cheated on me 4 times and i was dumb enough to stay with her. why? dont ask me. i "loved her" ehhh.      i have a hard time trusting anyone now a days.  what about you?|`|ae282ad4a748f8c85406e4649235ff16aa	Yes, a couple of times.

Everyone has some, but its up to you to decide if its you want to have a carry on or a trunk full.|`|1CqAQ3rlaa	ha ha,,its called learn from your mistakes..a part of lifes experiences..if you close your heart and mind to someone,,because of past experinces..you are only hurting yourself and not be able to enjoy whatever the other has to offer,,fully..  'learn from all your yesterdays,,put thats into today..to make a better tomorrow.."|`|12Aifvf4aa	The relationship I am in now (marriage) has been a very dfficult one and it has taken me over two years to get past my feelings of anger. I don't think I will ever trust my husband fully again as he is a compulsive liar, he lies to protect himself by default and has little concept of the hurt his lying causes. I know how to deal with it to keep myself safe.  I am not the only person he lies to.   If I allowed my knowledge of my husband's problem with the truth affect trusting others, it would make for a very lonely miserable life, so I don't let it.|`|U5IigAByaa	definitely. my therapist says the most destructive relationship i've had that is affecting my life/relationship now is the one i had with my parents. but my ex really really hurt me, but i guess it happens to everyone. you just have to try and wipe the slate clean and carry on!|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	Once you've had your heart broken it's hard to let yourself fall for another person, in fear of the emotional pain one endures over the loss of a relationship.    But sometimes you just have to learn to trust yourself, and allow the emotions to go in which ever direction they will.    My advice to anyone would be that if you're noticing red flags from the beginning, then you need to allow your gut instincts to direct you.    Don't put on rose colored glasses assuming the red flags will go away or that you're just being paranoid.|`|yRRnbNqXaa	Oooh, yes :) My 1st boyfriend, the only man I have seen as my husband and the father of my children left me for another girl and now has two children with her. That was 7 years ago and for 2 years after that I felt totally numb, rejected plenty of nice guys because I just couldn't fall in love anymore. I was probably afraid of getting hurt again. Then, when I finally did fall for a guy I kept comparing him with this ex, which let to the end of our relationship because he just got tired of listening about my ex and knew he would never be able to measure up to him. Now, as long as 7 years later, I've finally moved on, kept the nice memories but threw away the bitterness. Like a heroine of one my favourite books said "past is for learning from and letting go". Now I can finally say that too :)|`|HYrRkTjQaa	who hasnt? me and my bf are both affected emotionally due to past relationships. but we are helping eachother learn to trust again :)|`|A7r8xX7saa	Who hasn't? This is something common amongst all.|`|YIEUstMgaa	I am being emotionally hurt RIGHT NOW  it's horrible and i really am stuck because i cannot break away cause i have too many stong feelings for him but he sleeps with another girl and goddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd i dunno what to do .   but yeah  theres our answer    i will not trust a man again x|`|Snl9iiZ6aa	yes it is affecting how i deal with all people|`|Gx14PIvxaa	My ex cheated on me with his ex-wife. I stayed and tried to work it out for 6 months. Just couldn't get past it/over it.    My current boyfriend is AMAZING, but I do take everything with a grain of salt. A relationship is about TIME and trusting someone's actions. The longer you are together and each remain faithful to the other, trust and love grow. Of course in the back of my mind I am scared or doubtful, but as long as he is faithful to me then I trust him!|`|Y8uruHzKaa	Who hasn't?   But you learn things from past relationships and take it away and make sure it doesn't happen again or work on it in a new one. Yeah you might find it hard to trust anyone for a while but not all guys/girls are the same.   Building trust is all about time.  My boyfriend i was with we broke up and 3 days later he kisses a girl heaps of times started to like her and she sent him a dirty picture of herself it killed me, it hurt so bad and it still does, she effed him around and he came back to me saying he was confused and made a mistake i got back with him because he is not that type of guy so he obivosuly must of made a mistake. but i still dont trust him but its getting there with time. I always think what if? and how could he moved on so fast? i always think about it and it makes me cry and i get jealous and angry if they talk and that and he gets angry and asks me why im like that, still he just doesnt understand how bad it hurt! and i always check his messages on his phone i cant trust him just yet but i do love him heaps.|`|B66Jeq6Baa	yes..im totally cynical now.  AND back with the guy who hurt me originally.  i need a round of applause for my terrible decision making.|`|mJWUpU8Uaa	Yeah i guess i will join the confessing group. My first broke my heart im 22 and we have been together for 4 years. He cheated on me, i forgive but not completely i thought i could handle it but i always checked up on him. He hurt me to the core, im in a new relationship now i think i love him, but i will not say it just because im afraid to. I trust him but i dont complete let my guard down for him. Sometimes i'll ask him is this relationship is completley honest and he'll just look at me with this concern look and say yes, he knows that i have been hurt before.|`|hN7VGU8Xaa	You know - the way you lot have answered anyone wud think all men are bas****s. I don't really remember having been hurt in any emotional relationships, but then again i haven't had many so.........    My advice to anyone who has been hurt in a relationship is to try and move on - don't dwell on the past - look to the future because that is where brightness and hope can lay for you. Don't let a past hurt bother you because then, essentially, the person that inflicted the hurt is winning.     CERTAINLY do not let it effect your current relationship because then you are letting a past event control your future and your life and this can lead to depression and (worst case scenario) suicide. Just learn to move on and leave the past behind you - new and better things await for all in the future and you just have to find them.    One final thing - don't let it effect your trust or love in another. They are just one person and realistially (even though it may not seem like it) there are probably more decent and caring people out there than their are spiteful and untrustworthy ones. Anyway even if this is not the case then we are the only hope of maintaining the decency of the human race and we should therefore give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if this means we are the ones that have to shoulder the pain we should be strong because we are (pardon the cliche) the light in the darkness.    Hope this helped 8^)|`|cgk2yefUaa	OOOOO I  can honestly say i dont think i will EVER trust another man AGAIN (and i believe in true love and happy endings LOL) !! But ive been hurt soo badly in the last 18 mths my world has been turned upside down and its me who is a emotional wreck and to be honest im soo upset that my life has turned out like this and im stuck feeling this way !!! (by feeling this way i feel i must have missed out on my TRUE LOVE !!) that what i mean )so then you wonder have you let them go ! did you not fight for them enought ! or were your barriers to high !!  ive always dreamed of the "happy ever after situation" and wished it was me even when we were together for so many years and had a child together !!! I know this sound like i want to live in a bubble LOL but its exactly what you wrote ONCE BITTEN TWICE SHY THREE TIMES NO WAY LOL !!!!!!|`|3bf6bf2fa95deff37a266b5813651ca7aa	My husband hurt me more than anyone could have ever hurt me and in more than one way, he continues to hurt me still to this day. The worst part is, it is all out of vengence. He is a vindictive, cold person.     I loved this man more than words can explain. At one point I doubted my love for him, however it was all because I was overly stressed and confused. Well I ended up doing some stupid things, which I regret the H*ll out of. In return my husband did some even more hurtful things which decided our fate as a couple. At first it didn't bother me too much but as time goes on, it's getting more and more harder to deal with. After everything we went through as a family, everything I did for him and our family...    Since that whole mess with my husband I haven't been able to trust anyone. I have tried dating but cannot get interested in anyone, I don't feel anything. No interest at all.|`|5lFB3eWIaa	have got the gold  tee-shirt. i could explain but it would take forever
0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Well, I know in Oregon you have to have the marriage license for at least seventy-two hours, but not more than thirty days. You need to start by going to your local courthouse or other place they provide marriage licenses and see how long you are required to have it before the ceremony. After that you can simply go to a justice of the peace or any person who is legally certified as an officiant; you must have two witnesses though.|`|63Vf0n65aa	vegas|`|q2DNCfJAaa	Don't do it, it will be be biggest mistake of your life.|`|vdgQKhuPaa	Depends on where you live and how far you are willing to travel to get it done.  Call your local Courthouse and ask the procedure, each state is different; some have a waiting period some do not.  Local courthouse can tell you (usually the Assumed Names dept handles weddings).    Otherwise, i would suggest Vegas as another reader already said!|`|8g51eBf1aa	Go to the court house. There might be a 3 day waiting period before you can actually get married.(Depending on where you live.) You will need a drivers license or state ID and a birth certifcate. And without your parents permission you have to be 18 or over.|`|156d702b8908052bd0660d07c6803996aa	Go to the court house and have a judge marry you two. Justice Of The Peace is a cheap and fast way to go about it. You can always renew your vow's later. Also you have to apply for a marriage certificate and that can take up to a week.|`|0Id85yiYaa	call the courthouse and see if they can marry you today. good luck and congrats!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	First you have to file for a marriage license and then ask the local courthouse when the next opening is.|`|tBODwcqXaa	Call the courthouse and set up an appointment!

Congratulations :)|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	You need to be in a state without a waiting period for the license - I believe Nevada & Virginia are the only ones that have no waiting period at all, but there might be others.    Just check the courthouse and see when you could get a judge to marry you.    www.usmarriagelaws.com may help you with info as well.|`|hlM4jqmpaa	The quickest and least expensive way is to get married at the court house or by a judge.

AA11596133	My mother in law is totally whacked.  She is a game player, a back stabber, and an extreme two faced liar.  Thankfully, my husband was fully aware of this before we got married, and he banned her from our lives.  Frankly, I could care less WHY she is like this, I have much more important things to do with my life than to worry about her.    I learned long ago, that I cannot please everyone, nor am I going to try.  Either someone will choose to like me or not - they do have that right.  If you LET what she says or does bother you, you are letting her control you.  Just pretend she does not exist and let her go.  Seriously - her problems are hers - do not let them become yours.|`|W5VRYpaNaa	you need to talk to your husband...he needs to nip this in the bud quickly...    your mother in law should not be doing this...she is obviously suffering from some sort of power and control issues, but this should not be allowed within YOUR marriage...    your husband should call his mother and tell her how he is embarrassed and ashamed of what she is doing...if she hears it come from her son she may see how ridiculous she is being...    if this doesn't work than you are going to have to just move on...but never be rude back to her...    good luck!|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	welcome to married life, most mother in laws are bitches from hell... I am going to save you some wasted time..... there is nothing you can do to change her, she is a crazy *****, and there is no logic to her insanity, the best you can do is avoid going around her and getting into a confrontation, because you will not win, remeber,  if you wrestle a pig in the mud, you get dirty and the pig enjoys it.....|`|R29QkoQDaa	no idea
uGEz4X0caa	I totally feel your pain.  My bf's mom calls me a skank and a **** and any other little pet name she can think of at the time.  My bf does absolutely nothing about it.  So I just told him that until his mom can grow up, the kids will not be allowed over there (because she's done this in front of them), and I do expect an apology.  If those terms can't be met, then you know what, it's her loss.  Your monster-in-law is going to have a grandchild and if she can't grow up and put her petty little attitude away and show you some respect, especially in front of your child, then you two need to rethink your relationship with her.  Good luck with that.|`|mdtkor2Paa	sorry about your situation
50ab85f362cbbddab47844295a4bba7caa	Sounds like you've got some pretty good ideas.    We got married in November. My bridesmaid dresses were a dark chocolate brown color. We decorated with lots of gourds and leaves. We also had large branches potted and strung white lights on them (we probably had about 8 of them set up around the room).|`|7CKipTZOaa	Okay not all of these are for everyone but I think they could work nicely    The couples initials could be carved into pumpkins with battery operated candles inside, or words like love carved  or incoporate carved pumpkins and wooden wreathes with leaves as centerpieces   http://weddingsbyjess.com/files/2008/03/...  http://mixmingleglow.com/blog/wp-content...    http://www.rionflowers.com/images/Weddin...    Or if thats too much , classic lanterns could be beautiful http://www.weddingstyle.ca/detailview/Fa...    Food: Warm soups in glasses like butternut squash, things accented by maple, and hot cidar, apple pie are classic autumn treats    Little pumpkins/squashes could make unique place card holders, pin the names to them, and could also make for stunning decorations placed in various height clear vases around the reception/wedding    Sunflowers, and wheat can be made into intricate boquets incoporating autumn and would look great in antique buckets    Using something vine like rather than solid branches you could likely wrap around support beams with clear twine and just weave in details like berries.    Your wedding sounds like it is going to be lovely.    Also antique buckets could be filled with ice and used to chill bottles of wine/beer/water anything|`|cdL4wzGbaa	I was gonna tell you about the apple cider idea.Definitely do it.|`|adljBuxTaa	I was in a fall themed wedding last year.  She had some beautiful stuff.      She used tall, cylinder vases filled with different color apples, lemons, cranberries and limes.  They were strikingly beautiful!    She actually bought vine pumpkins from the one spot at Target and surrounded them with leaves.  Her wedding was on a serious budget but it looked beautiful!    Also think about making caramel apples for favors or bags of cider mix tied with a cinnamon stick.  Good luck!|`|qttPOdRBaa	Congrats. You are on the right track, and have wonderful ideas.  Although, the apple cider thing is a little different.  You can use thin clear twine (the kind you use for fishing).  You can't really see it.|`|rjY9Q8wiaa	There are so many great ideas for a fall wedding. You could create beautiful leave arrangements as center pieces. You could also have your guests throw leaves instead of rice or bubbles!     I found a really cool idea for fall wedding favors at this site: http://www.bridesvillage.com/fall-leaf-o...    These favors are actual leaves that are made into ornaments! They are beautiful, and surely would be appreciated by your guests. On that site, also, they have a wedding program designed specifically for fall weddings.
vrsMTzNYaa	Yes u have a right to be angry, he is just angry because he's stressed he was caught out, so that's why he is being over defencive your are angry because the way you felt about him you were hurt  and it's totally justified, normal and reasonable for you to feel like this.|`|EunkYJ5Baa	yes hun you have i would be, it waas like he was using you tell something he thought better came along, not saying there is that is, but some men dont like to be lonely an mess with girls head to fill a gap, i say try an get over him as their will be much more hurt awaiting if you dont x

I am all for second chances and all, but leaving you for someone else... Man, the woman who can get past that and have a TRULY happy, fulfilling life is my hero. I know I sure couldn't.|`|ndikVGQeaa	Dont take him back,cause when he finds another woman,his going to dump you again.|`|cCdhHyF8aa	i would never stay or go back with someone who cheated on me....never. and as for your possible pregnancy..I would never stay with a man just because I was pregnant either|`|AA11328507	Perhaps you can but I could NEVER ever take back a man that cheated on me.  I did it when I was young and dumb but we live in a different age where STDs can KILL ya.  I couldn't fully trust again.  Too bad he didn't want to live for God before he dumped you for another woman.|`|wGMabky2aa	Hello,    Wow, sounds like you have a crisis. Whether you want to take him back or not, it is YOUR decision, you are the only one that is going to live with the consequences of you decision. So i say you really think about it and hopefully you make the right decision.|`|AA10880720	You probably aren't pregnant. And being pregnant is not an excuse to be with the father. The mistake ppl make when considering getting back together with an ex is that they only remember the good times.     Remember when he broke your heart and completely disrespected you when he left you? Remember how he took you for granted? He probably always knew in the back of his mind that he was just having fun and you would take him back.     I don't think its about what he wants anymore. He wants a woman of God. He's ready to have a relationship with you now. He didn't care about your feelings when he left you. It's not about him. What do YOU want? Do YOU trust him?    By the way, he will say anything you want to here just for you consider your feelings for him again.|`|mzYsk112aa	People like you pi$$ me off.  Godly this and that and oh yeah, I think I might be pregnant.  Chose a side of the fence and stick with it.  Either way.  If you are pregnant I hope that you and your baby both have long and healthy lives without this guy.  Sure he should help support the child if it's his but you don't need to continue a relationship with a twice confirmed cheater for the baby to know it's father.  Seems you have a man like King David.  He sees something better on the roof so he takes it.  Though he may live to great things "for god" I wouldn't want to be his friend.  He might try to kill me and take my wife.  One who knows his god forgives him for anything he does can be a dangerous man.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	it takes as long as it takes, and i don't think you should put a time on it.    i personally would not give him a chance.  been there, done that...i've given out all the chances i had, plus many many more!!|`|LLeQyWGcaa	hey just me. i agree with  you totally. he has to earn your trust back and would be out of line to expect that to happen soon. like you said if you were meant to be it will happen. you are a smart person and you are taking the right approach to this.|`|ZaMzRSrraa	since he has found God .. you should give him a chance    but......one slip and its over for good|`|0d0W0nbVaa	i just heard the whispers from God.    he says 'tell the lady to leave me out of it'    got that?|`|s1LfdCdsaa	Burnt once, shame on thee, burnt twice, shame on ME.    Even if you are pregnant, hold him financially responsible for child support beginning from day one (see a lawyer in your area to determine what you are entitled to and if you can start collecting support even before the baby is born, like women in CA are able to do).  Having a baby does not consign you to marriage to the biological father, especially one who proved himself unable to commit before.    There are many more WRONG reasons to get married than RIGHT ones. Why do you think that so many marriages end in divorce?
AuUCnUtsaa	i think that you should say yes if you really like him. i am really sorry about his brother that must have been really hard on you. i dont think there is a disadvantage if you really like him go for it but its your choice not mine. i hope this helps|`|vrfuO9Asaa	sorry i wouldnt and did u say u were 13! if u the person u were engaged 2 died and u liked him i would just engage his younger brother unless u actually like him|`|v6KSGrlJaa	if you think hes has potential to be great husband you can reply you need time to get to know him first,usually rush choices are bad choices so think about it.|`|qEH9dbT9aa	dont say anything yet. you are too young to get engaged or whatsoever. why am i a muslim, yet my parents are agaisnt arranged marriage? weird. nevermind. just get along with the boy first. don't say yes / no to the proposal yet.|`|AA11104967	The brother died Tuesday and they called you Wednesday to see if they could engage you to the brother??....the dead guys body is still warm....his little brother is so upset that he is thinking about you instead of his dead brother??? wha wha whatttttt?? You are a 13 r old child and the 15 yera old wants you to live with him now???? huh?  Somehow this seems a little unrealistic......|`|JOtnpGaQaa	well, he's only two years older then you, if i did my math right, so i guess it should be okay. But you have to think about it, do you really like him enough to merry him? Do you think he could make you happy, as you can make him happy? Do you think he's good husband material? What does your heart tell you? He might just be making this out of the sad feelings of his brothers death. He could be doing this for his brother cause he loved him that much. Or he could actually have feelings for you and really want to marry you. I say you talk to him clearly and ask him if he's sure he wants to be with you. its a special time for one when you get merried. It should not be taken lightly.|`|dSTBhUwDaa	well i would say yes to him and try to run away so i don't get married and my parents don't have to tell me what to do anymore... and if you want to talk here is my email cristelagracia@yahoo.com and let me know....|`|1Q8X83ITaa	Don't say yes! You are to young to get engaged. There is plenty of time left. Get to know him before you commit the rest of your life to him.
D4mT82Wtaa	Shy girls are hard to work with but if a girl put some effort forth and talked to me and she was nice i would definitely hang out with her. Then when she opened up after being friends i would definitely ask her out. All you have to do is make friends with a guy you like and then you will open up and they will see that its cool to date you. I also like girls that are interesting and have a great personality. A girl that i can have a conversation with and that can make me laugh is awesome. If your shy then be friends with a guy first and then you will be able to open up.|`|NRiuGQvIaa	yes every girl has to be confident around us.<br>  being shy is not always a turn off especially when where shy ourselfs<br>  so call it even in most cases.<br>  & quailities we look for hot,skinny  or healthy fat,enjoy sports & watching movies,hiking & be willing to sky dive with you or do fun stuff<br>  other than buy me this & that,non golddigger,light skin or tan,eat healthy,enjoy gym or staying fit,funny,smart,her own job & career open<br>  minded & humble & non gold digger she gotta be into you for we are not beacuse of the things we buy them & herself|`|bPaJXHw8aa	Can u be my friend..

Just go chat with some of the guys you like (or don't hate). Try not to be totally shy around them, just start a conversation. <br>  <br>  I don't really find shyness a turn-off, although it can make relationships and friendships a little harder to get going. <br>  <br>  Disregarding physical traits, i like girls that are at least kinda intelligent. Funny is good too. Easy to talk to, trustworthy.... <br>  <br>  There's a huge list, but what tops it off for me is just kindness. <br>  <br>  My best friend (who i actually like as more than a best friend, but she's taken... by my other best friend, of course) is not the most beautiful girl, certainly, but i love her cuz she's fun to talk to and she's normally pretty nice to me, except when we're around him. She's funny too.|`|OL5D3E1zaa	i like shy girls|`|KSQ8y2Itaa	call me
AA10986891	WOW your husband is really immature. He is acting like a teenage boy, you should treat him like one if  he wants to act like one.|`|AA11596133	This is WHY it is not a good idea to keep separate accounts.  You BOTH should KNOW what money is where, and be able to AGREE on how it gets spent OR saved.  Sounds like you two have more problems than this between you - - -     Call and report the card missing right now.  Do NOT say it was stolen, just say you cannot find it - that way they will contact you IF anyone tries to make a purchase with it. If you say you KNOW the card is GONE, your tax refund will be denied for deposit and will be sent back to the treasury. Just say you know it is in your house but cannot find it and want t a hold put on it until you find it.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	call and report the card lost.  that way even though he has the card, it won't be able to be used.|`|8txWayVnaa	Is his name on YOUR account?  Girl, this is easily solved.  Report the card as stolen, because it was.|`|LVlS4y7Caa	Wow. You have a REAL problem.  I'd call and tell them the card was stolen and get a new one and ensure he NEVER gets his hands on it again.  The bigger problem is your joint lack of understanding/communication when it comes to money...It isn't quite so simple as he puts it, "what's yours is mine - what's mine is yours" and he needs to get a clue to this...he sounds utterly irresponsible and not at all a man you can trust, judging from what you state here.    Do you have debts?  Are they jointly shared?  Who pays the bills, do you share this responsibility?  Something here is woefully wrong with your relationship that will doom it for sure IF, you two don't lay down ground rules NOW.    Sincerely,    Grace|`|6aVtiTKiaa	If the card is in your name and his isn't on it anywhere, that is theft.  I don't know what to tell you.  You can report it stolen and file a police report, but then they might throw him in jail.|`|ZkeoRyy3aa	did you know it is considered controlling by the courts to hold money away from your spouse that is rightfully both of yours.  Maybe its his time to hold the money.  You my dear need to let go and relinquish some control, before he figures out he can have you thrown in jail.|`|AA11460234	Lock down the account. Pronto.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	Not sure what ugh is but I assume it is a term used to mean disgruntlement. I personally would call the bank and put a hold on the account immediately so that your funds are safe. All you have to do is tell them you lost the card and they will cancel it and issue you a new one. End of problem on the money issue. Then you might want to examine why you are with a man who 1) doesn't work 2) invades your privacy 3)disrespects you and 4) puts you and your children in harms way by not allowing you to pay important bills. Perhaps this is a sign that a change is in order.|`|slKPLRLaaa	I just dont understand how two people can be married and not sharing their financies... blows my mind.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	man, is he ever in a cushy situation.    and you, my dear, are a dope.|`|e87cd8e8c653d0f68402573b2d9f3ef1aa	"What's mine is yours" is so not right, I don't care if you're married.  You don't have to give him this and that.. And I would change you're pin number and keep is secret and the number something he wouldn't think you'd think of.. and of course report the card stolen.    You maybe married but still this is YOUR money.. Bring married doesn't give him the right to take what isn't his.  Think about it if you're roles were reversed, what would he do to you if you took his card?  Is he working? Does he have his own money? Sounds cruel but you could put him on like an allowance and only give him money if he deserves it.. I know this sounds childish but many MEN do it to their wives  etc etc.. .. I dunno.. I wouldn't be with a man that takes my stuff.. Who knows he could be doing something/one on the side or is sifoning off your cash.. Honestly who knows what anyone does these days.    Good luck.    PS very smart of you not to get joint accounts.. My parents are having fights about cash.. my dad is seasonal and thus isn't working.. he spents my moms cash while she slaves like a dog 12 hrs a day and has no fun.. but when it's his money he won't even buy tampons or food.. Christ you need to write a list of reasons why you need something to him before he'll consider buying stuff |`|AA11319441	I don't blame you for being mad.  I would be too.  But, it's sad that your relationship is like that.  Most married couples wouldn't find that normal.|`|5k7BexD3aa	Maybe he thinks you are a control freak because you deposited it SOLELY into your bank account.
DQuxhbHUaa	they don't love you|`|dZ1efw1Paa	Ahh yeah I have the same exact issue.  I used to be caught up in it all but now I just ignore it all. When people start trying to reel me into the madness I just keep my distance. I hang out with another friend who is trying to stay out of it too. It works, and when your friends start to see that you're not interested in drama then they'll stop coming to you or it'll atleast get better.|`|CqLo8nk2aa	I went through this a couple of years ago. I think your friends aren't back stabbing you, but are back stabbing each other. I think that if you choose a side, your only involving yourself in the fight, and thats not right. I think you need to talk to both sides, and tell them that you feel like your in the middle of everything and just be honest. If this doesn't work, it might be time to find some new friends. Its hard i know.    Hope i helped, and good luck!|`|Uv7tkyBPaa	Your friends dont have any right to ask you to take sides and you dont HAVE to. Tell them they r al ur friends and need to work it out amongst themselves. Stay out of their fights and dnt do wht u r nt comfortable with|`|Tw52vXYCaa	last year my whole table split in half because the 2 sides were always fighting.  That way it is better because now we don't fight and we are all friendly to each other.|`|Y8uruHzKaa	It really depends on what there fighting about, just try and help both sides so everything sorts out but if you think its best to sit out just sit out and let them sort it out for themselves. Don't be a follower and if one person or more hates someone and that person they hate didnt do anything to you dont hate them because thats silly. Girls are really bitchy i'm over them at the moment boys are more laid back and calm and there fun to chill with girls gossip and judge and what not they need to grow up . im 14 going on 15 btw so yeah ahha|`|KcLWaFK4aa	find new friends

We are using Dont' want to miss a thing by Aerosmith, because that is the first song we ever danced to together...    Your wedding song should be a song that means something to both of you and will still mean something in the years to come...
CGlDAvkAaa	What's wrong with having only one friend? Everyone has a best friend. Maybe the people your trying to hang out with aren't good association. Look at it as a good thing instead of a bad one. People are attracted to others when they are confident and secure in themselves. Be who you are. if they come around great if not oh well, their loss. Your there to learn and move on , not to make friends.|`|bgk2y17Maa	who cares what other ppl think dont let them give you those thoughts. you sound like a really nice girl. pray about God will not let you down i promise. and it doesnt look weird to have a limited amount of friends i only have one too but i trust her completely. no worries what those other people think maybe speak up a little in class to show your personality if someone doesnt really know you there not gunna wanna chit chat. good luck <br>  many blessings your in my prayers|`|9wgyeY2maa	there is always gonna be people that are gonna betray you but you do not have to kill yourself and if you think that killing yourself will do any good you need to try to talk to the college consular and go to church...<br>  sometimes it is better to be alone then with backstabbers or fakes
I2NnRUK0aa	Man you need to spend more time with her....first you need to know her. Be nice to her and show that you care about her. If she like you, she will be yours. Else you should move on with life.|`|WD94WyICaa	Where did you meet her?  Oh that's right... You Didn't!!  You can't guess!!  Be sure.  Talk to her more.  If you want to meet her I'm not going to tell you no.  I'm not your mother.  I just hope you didn't meet her online.  Sometimes you get lucky other times you don't.  Just be careful.  Advice not a demand.|`|NCSemk4Xaa	I second the Threesome!|`|kZlmAybgaa	threesome|`|wuR48sKsaa	You probably should try to befriend her.  This way, if she likes you like she says she does, you will stay in her thoughts.  She will know she has options and if the guy really is a jerk eventually he is going to mess up.  Then she will be all yours.
KIKUBbT6aa	Everyone will encounter someone in their time of conversation that will be smarter than you.  Just ask them to expand on what they are talking about and let them know you are not familiar with that subject.  When you have to uphold your end of the conversation talk about what you do KNOW.<br>  <br>  I always believe you should know a little bit about everything instead of a lot about one thing.|`|seMpUL8Kaa	Nod and smile.|`|WFRooU7Maa	Don't act like you know everything<br>  ask questions or for clarification if you need it<br>  <br>  Also don't studder and sound confident when you speak<br>  If you talk like what you say is true and no one else knows much about it they will believe you|`|z0yyBvqlaa	It's really pretty easy. If you don't understand something, ask them to explain it. If they talk down to you, you shouldn't be talking to them in the first place!|`|gXG3bRwaaa	put a bag over ur head or just pretend to have down syndrome

Be polite, be compassionate, Dont think about "sex" all the time when your with her, Listen, Be yourself...|`|fAdh5BAkaa	buy her a iron and ironing board|`|oI63HnDqaa	Be honest with her<br>  Always treat with respect and understanding.<br>  Treat her in a way that will make her want to be with you<br>  She should feel like a princess in your eyes, and enlightened after she is with you<br>   She should see that you do your best to make her happy and to understand her.|`|osZ5zVEDaa	By the Hour... <br>  <br>  Couldn't help myself. Okay so the best way is...<br>  Internet, in person by being yourself and a gentleman, and/or asking someone out. It is really hard with out the asking part. Don't be afraid to get shot down. I know it is easier said then done, but seriously don't mind being shot down. Maybe even use it. Ask why they said no and be open to constructive criticism. Have some common sense though. If 1 girl likes the Goth look then that is just what she likes and not who you are so oh well.
xOiafJpoaa	A little pat on the butt is not abuse, it simply show the child who is boss, however, this should not be a common punishment. After a spanking, the parent should let the child know that they still love them, just not their actions, they should talk to the child and let them know why what they did was wrong. A while ago, it was perfectly ok to smack a young child with a belt or paddle, this, in my oppinion is abuse. I think that anything that leaves a mark is abuse.|`|7qvxwxz6aa	A small spanking is discipline or time outs or somethin. But, hitting you repeatedly and telling you that there's no use crying is child abuse. Also plz no more abuse questions!|`|uGEz4X0caa	child abuse leaves bruises and other injuries, and it's done in anger and to gain complete control of the child, it is designed to put fear in the child.  Discipline is meant to train the child and teach the difference between right and wrong.  Usually with no physical harm done to the child (time out's etc.)|`|2BEMSGPdaa	Yea in most cases it left up to the children to decide. When I was a kid I never knew the Abuse Hotline  number...

It is called sexual harassment.    And then you come home and tell him about how you get hit on,   which is manipulating him.    You first either quit the job you have or start reporting those guys who sexual harass you.    He stops playing on the internet.    You both find a good church with a pastor who is married and start marriage counseling together|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	He's going to have to grow up. With that many tales of cheating, he was cheating. Usually there is some truth to rumors. I think the guilty dog barks first. He doesn't want you going out b/c he knows what he does when he's out.|`|pRZ0YviYaa	Why don't you provide some boundaries, i.e. you will not talk to other men online and he will not talk to other women.  It seems as thought you and your husband are currently trying to maintain a marriage without clear boundaries or guidelines, and this is not advisable.  If he can't maintain a marriage within the boundaries that you are comfortable with then clearly he can not maintain a marriage with you.|`|jLLkSWyiaa	tell him that if he really  loves you and wants the relationship to work that he needs to be honest with you at all times! i have really bad trust issues because of my ex and now my boyfriend that i have recently started dating tells me everything and shares everything with me and always asks me i ever want to go with him places because he knows im scared to let my guard down and that im scared that what happened in my past is gonna happen again .. so i know exactly what you are feeling   and if he wont show you the messages then tell him that your not sure how you can possibly trust him ne more ... let him know exactly how you feel and why... tell him if he cared he would do everyhting in his power to show you he cares   if not .. then ditch him hun     im really sorry to this|`|mJWUpU8Uaa	idk what to say about this situation, maybe you should tell him to not do these things to you and make you feel suspicious

Don't be creepy!|`|SSfXwkpnaa	nothing cheesy. just talk to her normally maybe even be friends but once you know enough about her ask her to go somewhere she like for example if she likes ice skating ask her if she wants to go with you and maybe make a joke to take the edge off like 'bcuz i need someone to show me how its done'<br>  <br>  just b chilled  and girls like it when a guy can make her laugh<br>  <br>  good luck|`|JlgbIqZNaa	Are you a parking ticket?

S8mAO0L5aa	well i'm a girl and so i know how i, and how my friends that are girls, would want a guy to take me. Just be yourself. Know that the girl probably feels just as awkward as you and chances are, if you don't talk to her, she'll never go up to talk to you. to tell you the truth, a lot of girls feel like guys are supposed to be the ones going up to talk to the girls for the first time so just try it, go up and talk to the girl you want to talk to. Talk to her about something you've noticed that she likes, whether it's a sports jacket she always wears or how she always talks about a certain vacation spot she loves to visit. If you don't know anything about it, that's fine, just ask her about it. Don't be afraid to tease her a bit like you would a friend, not anything rude or something she could take as offensive, but just a little joke. hope that helps!|`|b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	Just be confident and relax.

This is when we get so anxious and nervous when approaching a girl that we can't seemingly talk to them (hell, even the very thought of approaching a girl makes us quiver in our boots!) <br>  <br>  Everyone else has already stated what I'm about to say pretty much. You need to practice. Talk to random people- wherever, whenever, for whatever dumb reason. Talk up a random guy in line at the store. Have a conversation with the cute barista while waiting for your drink. Keep doing it until it becomes second nature to approach any girl and talk to them. You, my friend, need confidence, and I'm positive that the more you practice, the more confident you'll be. Plus, confidence is extremely attractive to girls- hence why you always see shlubby guys with beautiful women. Practice, become confident and charming, and you'll have no problem talking to this, or any other girl.<br>  <br>  Hey, can I pimp my question real quick? I need some advice as well, please and thank you!!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=As2zQ6JejaJbenw.EvigRCDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225010840AAFKN0y">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|LA2nJToYaa	Ok here is some advice on talking to women...don't go straight for the perfect 10s and models of the women species. Go talk to a girl you may not be that into at first, but someone who you do find somewhat attractive. Have no intention of ever asking her out. Talk with her about anything to ease your nervousness and to build confidence. Then when you are ready go after that looker you have been eyeing. Stand up straight, keep your eyes locked onto her eyes and engage her to talk about herself. Ask her questions about what she likes what she hates etc. This will allow her to talk and you to listen...women LOVES guys to listen. Feel free though to disagree with her in a humorious tone though, tease her a bit but don't insult her. Girls love it when guys throw them negs lightheart like. Don't stutter and try not to seem nervous girls can hone in on that like a lion to an baby zebra. Act very nonchalantly like you could care less if she wants you not but act like every other girl cept for her does...girls love it when they think they can get a guy that other girls can...they are evil in a good way like that. Don't ask her on a romantic date...instead focus in on something she said she likes and set up an event based around that.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|CGlDAvkAaa	Why are you nervous? Do you like the girl your talking to? Nervousness comes from lack of confidence in yourself. Doesn't matter if it's a girl, guy, employer etc. Try examining yourself to see where your lacking confidence and work on that. maybe try a new hair style or clothing trend of your own. talk about what might interest everyone so the conversation can keep on going. you'll get better at it as time goes on and you'll be a pro soon|`|XyW61gukaa	Ah well i used to be that way but i figured out that the best way not to be nervous is to be nervous and be your self, a girl likes it when you are your self most girls will hate it when a guy doesnt act like him self.I found out that taking something up works, i took up guitar and self taught my self and it feels good when i play for my friends because its just the feeling of doing it and when playing for girls yea i get nervous but you know what sooner or later one of them is going to come up to me and talk to me so....|`|neeSMyMLaa	Ask yourself why you're nervous. Is it really necessary to get nervous, she probably won't bite, will she?<br>  <br>  If you have something in mind you want to say, practise it before hand. Make sure you know what you're going to say, and make sure you don't ramble.<br>  <br>  Deep breath.<br>  <br>  SMILE!|`|q2AsDnjpaa	just keep doing it.<br>  Get more confidence. Martial arts is a great way to get confidence and gets you in good shape so the girls will like you more.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	they dont bite...pretend you've known her for a longtime
QieRAMLkaa	no offence....but where the hell do you live that you get put in jail for smoking weed??????  thats just odd,  I live in NY and the MOST you get for being caught smoking is a fine equivilant to a parking ticket.....but usually they just lecture you for 20 mins and let you go.      but to your family,  they missed you, and its understandable that you want to be left alone but they are probably worried.  Why don't you call your uncle and say your really not up to seeing anyone, you want to relax and get back to normal but that you two should set aside a time next week or the week after where you two can just go out to eat, or him just come over and do whatever he normally does.|`|66jX06Onaa	Tell them you need some time to be by yourself. You can even (half joking about it) tell them that you NEVER had time without noise and without feeling like you were being watched for the last month, so it's a relief to be totally by yourself for a couple of weeks.    Reassure them that you learned a lesson and have no desire to return to jail and promise that you will see them soon.|`|r42DhVoNaa	they just want to show you that they love and care about you.     DeWayne|`|YFMaRxaWaa	if you explain to them that those 30 days was the worse days of your life.people yelling and telling you what to do trying to protect yourself but yet stay out of trouble eating that mess they called food.i know if that was your firsty time it was hard. so tell them you need time to re-coup.you need to put that behind you and learn your lesson.i'm sure they will understand. don't worry about their feelings right now just work on you first.

wVXXPRmZaa	Like every 3 days to a week.|`|AX4ffdNbaa	we love to snuggle and watch movies. that is our time, weather we have sex or not it doesn't matter. we love being with each other. being close to each other, hugs are wonderful too, just to feel his arms around me some days is all you need. he can all me during the day just to say I love you, and I am just as turned on as if we were getting ready to .... sex isn't the end all be all. my man makes me feel loved and tells me I am beautiful. and yes we have teens, and grand kids around. but they visit and then go home to mom. so we don't have privacy issues.|`|lFOkhDseaa	My boyfriend and I have been dating for 6 months.  He has 3 kids and I have 2.  We live about 2 blocks from each other and you would think we would get more time for intimacy.  We would have sex multiple times per day if we could.  As it is now, we get only a couple of times per week.  Any suggestions on alone time?  Each person is different.  He has the same drive that I do so we match.  You dont want to be unmatched or with someone that doesnt have the same desires you do.  If you dont care for it all the time, dont hook up with a hound dog.  And the opposite of course is true.
cMyPQ90vaa	well you need to stay away from married men and also the men in relationships go for the single ones and try to get to know that man before you let anything go far like be in a relationship with him or sleep with him and you'll find the right man. good luck :) and keep your head up!|`|a984cQjKaa	well, since it's interfering with your life, i'd say go and talk to someone like a therapist or something.  i totally understand you not wanting to get into a sexual relationship because you don't want to feel used, and there's nothing wrong with that at all.  but maybe talking to someone could help you find some way to turn down potential suitors in a less stressful way, and help you not be so angry.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	Perhaps there is something in the way that you dress or carry yourself that gives off that impression.  The best thing to do is try watching "What Not to Wear" (believe it or not) and see if you can find yourself in some of the single mom's they've shown.  <br>  <br>  There are several people on the show in similar postions to yours that dress way younger, and more revealing than is age appropriate.  Having a body is great, but that doesn't mean you need to show it all the time.  <br>  <br>  If it's not how you dress, then you need to think about your interactions with people.  Are you overly flirty?   Even if you aren't trying to be, maybe you should tone it down a little.  It may not be "who you are", but it will help with getting the wrong kind of complements.|`|jIsAIwCgaa	Maybe you should try one of those dating sites to find something "real" and "mature". I know those sites sound scary, but they do work for some people...|`|xtd2h5JTaa	do you wanna hook up?|`|XyW61gukaa	Your afraid that if you do something sexual you might get pregnant and have his kid then he might pass away or divorce you or something. What you want  is for someone to be with for more than a couple years then get married later on and then but your grieving your husbands death after all this time and that's a hard thing to deal with Ive had family members pass away and it does hurt its like a chunk of your life disappearing but you got to be headstrong. the longer you stay like this the less likely you will be able to handle a relationship.... Not all guys just want sex there are some of us that respect women until they want it.|`|mVJVUxSzaa	Have you and maybe your son as well, sought any counseling to deal with the fathers death? Part of the problem could be that you are somewhat afraid of getting into a serious relationship for fear of him leaving you like your previous mate, or because of something else. You should be telling yourself and feeling that dating guys who are already involved is absolutely out of the question. Considering (if you will pardon me), your son and your situation, you do not have room or time in your life for anybody else's drama.  Sex is almost always the thing that is first on guys minds especially if you are beautiful and sexy. Fortunately, there are exceptions. Be a "Choosy Lover". Figure out what kind of man is best suited for you and your son and except nothing less. In the meantime, give even more of yourself to your relationship with your son, your family, and God.
XuxZPdNdaa	Round 13 really... wOw!!!  make a bucket list and start taking action!
eK4NOevWaa	I know that feeling...Isn't there anybody around you that you can communicate?Somebody near your age?<br>  <br>  That is the only way unfortunately...Books are good as well but you start to become nuts when you just surf on the internet or watch TV...<br>  <br>  <br>  Sports or friends!!!|`|NHe6CAWNaa	Thanks for your advice<br>  Sorry to hear that, feel free to e-mail and i would take the other offer of e-mail up aswell.

Why don't you give those friends who live far away a call? Either way, you need to find new friends and I think the school idea is your best shot.|`|o7gckZ2Paa	I guess it all would depend on the type of area that you live in. I know you said they are about an hour away though. Are there any charitable organizations in your area? If you run your zip code and the term "charities" or "Charitable organizations" in a search engine, I'm sure you can find something.|`|lhl1820iaa	Thank you for answering my question :). <br>  <br>  Ahh i'm sorry that sounds really difficult :(. It's so hard to handle when everything comes your way at once. I had that fairly recently and it makes you feel really lonely. I was close to a breakdown. I'm trying to sort myself out by keeping myself occupied, but its difficult. Is there nothing you can do in your area? <br>  <br>  Feel free to add me. We could talk on msn? :)|`|TIweNeIZaa	you should call or IM ur friends, or hang out with a family member. plan a day when you can hang out with your friends if possible, too. try to make friends in your area, but for now maybe you could hang out with your friends directly after school and their parents could just pick them up an hour later. just walk around or play a sport idk.. do something close to ur school and then go home.<br>  HOPE I HELPEDD!|`|drI1vsJdaa	Do you have any local homeschool groups you can join? If not, there are some great places online to meet friends (NOT that kind of friend, like just an email pal)
TthDWtPTaa	why would you want to?|`|NQFV2AdZaa	Just think of something that you may have in common, like if you go to the same place etc. Start by saying hi and if they respond then the rest will be easy, good luck!
AA11080047	well moving out is a great idea. it makes you very independent it good for your job and your program it brings out the best in you. it also make you think about rent SHOPPING chores that you will have to do but it will really tell you what the world is all about which you should point out to your parents.|`|P1VoMS36aa	some cultures need to evolve,this sounds like one of them.  its not like your running away with a bf to live worthless life.  your an independent young woman trying to give herself a good life,your parents and the culture need to change there opinions.they should be proud  of you, and they should proud of themselves too for raising a bright young intelligent girl.  GOOD LUCK|`|WOHc22Xiaa	If your over 18 your an adult so do what the hell you want! Why are you so worried about it? They will get over it trust me. Im 21 and my family didn't want me to get my own apartment. I moved out and now they are fine. It's only down the street and around the corner literally but hey what can I say. Do what you need to do.|`|wCqzSt34aa	you should pray and ask God if this is what He would have u to do and if so than He will change ur parents hearts toward the subject, i respect ur way of living
dw440Lylaa	Is this a trick question?<br>  <br>  Would you be mad if we were dating, and I neglected to mention that I was married???<br>  <br>  <br>  OF COURSE!!!!!<br>  <br>  It's his child too......he has a right to know!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Luck|`|vO4uvoYBaa	what are you thinking, damm right i would be madd,|`|2zd9OjeMaa	If she was keeping it, yes. I need to know if I have any children out there.|`|509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	of course I will be mad.  why doesn't she tell me?  is that not my child?  where did you learn that she is pregnant?  I need to know!!!<br>  <br>  *** response to additional details ***<br>  the question is a totally different scenario.  guys will be mad if their current gf don't tell them.  if my ex didn't tell me she was pregnant, I can care less.  if she is pregnant, I am more being scared than being mad.  the first thing I want to make sure is that the child is mine.  I am the kind of person who never returns to the past.  If I were your bf, she is nothing more than my child's mom.  Not sure if your bf thinks the same way, though.|`|8a65VDAKaa	id like to know if im going to have a son. kids need a father figure in their lives.|`|e98RKB35aa	I sure would.|`|fPx4lwofaa	uh...the guy has a right to know. she should tell him. if she doesn't want him to have any part of the childs life, then she should of thought of that before she got pregnant. if he is a jerk and that is why she doesn't want him to know, then she can always not put his name on the birth certificate. but he has a right to know either way.|`|EP2TZWYEaa	most guys would would be because of the shock. but me personally i would want to try my best to support you and make sure that i am always there for you|`|oHN6jwjoaa	okay so i'm a girl.<br>  but i'm sitting next to a guy right now.<br>  <br>  and he said this.

bO2rzfISaa	You probably won't win this in court. Why don't you try to make an arrangement with the mom that would benefit the child. If you have to (if the child's well-being is what you really care about) leave the child support as it is.    We are in the same situation. My step-daughters live in poverty because their mom works for minimum wage and her lazy-*** husband won't work at all. We take the kids every day they aren't in school and provide hair cuts, clothes, healthy food, normal behavior (the step-dad is a conspiracy theorist and scares the crap out of the kids with his end of the world stories), table manners (they don't have a TABLE), etc, etc, etc. We take them in summer and let her keep the child support.|`|oojO4WAraa	You can request more time with your kid.  I don't think $$ has any bearing on the decision.  We do not take away parents rights just because they are poor.    There is no reason why you couldn't go through the courts and just request more time and involvement just because you love your kid.|`|t9c4vOZmaa	yep my friend is in low income housing and on the system as well and is facing losing her child the father has her involved in a custody case right now. So far she has lost full custody the judge said she can't provide solid financial support for the child. She does not have a job living in low income is an option not a life style.   Seriously being on the system and if a parent who isn't wants the child odds are the parent who is better off to support the child and provide a better place to live will get the child. Low income housing has problems I know when I was younger I lived in it and seen women milk the system and lose custody of their kids all the time. If I were in your shoes and this was my child I would go all out and go for full custody.  A child should be cared for not used for a meal ticket in my opinion more kids are used for welfare benefits and to live in low income housing for the benefit of the parent so basically a lot of cases the parents are using the child as a free hand out sad but true.  The poster above me said can't take away right because someone is poor true but you can take away rights if a parent is not properly supporting a child.|`|kuOhklDiaa	just a thought, if she lives in a low income neighborhood, maybe you can argue that the school system is better at your house  take pictures of your childs living environment at her moms house vs what you can offer  today i see many judges granting joint custody vs visitation  can you ask for this  or prove that your x is unstable emotionally and finacially and hope that you do not have to pay more child support  fyi......its a tough time with the economy, so you need to prove she was indigent and on government housing before 07.|`|aGOBuJtKaa	This was a situation that happened when I was a little girl, my dad took my mom to court because she couldn't afford things that he thought she should be able to afford. Basically the judge told my dad to get the hell out of his courtroom. Lack of money doesn't mean you can't still be a good parent. If you want to see your kids more fine, but don't do it for the reason you just specified.
vo7Ws7xtaa	I think it's just his style and comfort zone.  But it's his thing, you should dress how you want to.  And if he's not okay with that, then both of you need to talk about it.|`|CEKAqtB1aa	That's weird why does he need to dress up ALL the time? How can he think thats normal?<br>  Um if it doesn't get in the way of getting to know him I would carry on.|`|PHYGU5DQaa	Well Sometimes Though.<br>  But I Like A Man With A Layed Back Style, Still In Style Though.|`|hwlxPXh4aa	i'd love a boy that was just casual <br>  <br>  ~Luce x x x|`|RAzCYBolaa	I think I'd prefer casual.|`|6VI13LG2aa	i'd rather the jeans and polo shirt why dont you just tell him to dress down a little:D|`|u7o75zipaa	I like a laid back style.<br>  Formal is good..... for formal occasions.<br>  I prefer just hanging out in whatever you're comfortable in :) x|`|v398Qalyaa	i like smart, but a three piece suit... lovely on special occasions, the trouble is, he will never look any different when he does go somewhere special, could it be the way he's been brought up?
jRSzIzYqaa	Fifteen and eleven don't go together. Sorry. Move on. She's off limits anyway as the sibling of an ex.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	What I believe to be "right" is that you understand that at 15 you cannot be "in love".<br>  <br>  What you feel is attraction/infatuation/new hormones.<br>  <br>  In five years, when you are possibly ready to understand love, you probably won't even remember her name.|`|yr1xv9ohaa	i dont think he means that he is 15 and she's 11,...i think he means they are both in 11th grade,,,...sheesh people|`|vzm8osnIaa	Wow dude, if you are 15 you need not worry about any girl younger than 15 my man.... think about it, youll graduate in 2 year and be out of highschool.... She still has 6 or 7 years left|`|mGgesPRCaa	yea thats really ******* wrong.<br>  im 16 and have a problem with dating 14 year old girls|`|AA11136246	what about focusing on your studies first....|`|4MkI2hAkaa	Wait until SHE is 15. Yes, 15-11 is too far an age gap, and its not "wrong" to like her, but its definitely wrong to put any of it on her, she's only 11, after all, and probably fancies some one in her own year anyhow.|`|dGDQy584aa	She's 11, leave her alone.
I0O385V7aa	She's a horrible person. It's really understandable that you're hurt, but it looks like she suddenly decided that she doesn't like you, and so tried to hurt you as greatly as possible. Don't think that she's resented you for a long time- she's just saying this to cause you as much pain as possible. There have probably always been aspects of your personality she wasn't entirely happy with, but that's the same in every single friendship.    You'll just have to deal with the pain of losing her. Don't get too hung up on the good times you had- just remember that all good things come to an end. And this is just the way that things have progressed so you can't really change anything.    Don't let her cause you so much pain. She's just some stupid b*tch with an ugly personality.    As for an explanation, I'm afraid that people are like this- they can just start hating people for no reason.|`|Wx1W1vSeaa	Oh my gosh, that's sad. I mean, I went through the same thing a couple weeks ago. I'm sorry but just go on with your life, make new friends, I mean, show her that you don't need her, have fun without her with your new friends, and when people ask you if you guys are fighting just say "Nope" and quickly change the subject. I betcha they'll get the point.|`|7tAH3GEBaa	I say forget her. I realize that you guys share the same friends but you should just go to school and pretend that it really doesn't matter. This way you will have prepared yourself for anything and at the same time she might possibly say sorry. But don't count on it otherwise you will be expecting it. Just try to move on with your life. Like you said in five years it really wont matter. That is more true than you know. Just take in what she said and try to make yourself a better person.|`|f1a7c9b6b59a85d3cbcccab541ef30d8aa	i diddnt read yur longg.  super long paragrah but my advise is to  1. try to talk    if it works, everythings fine.    if it doesnt    2. FORGETT HERRR.    seriouslly, yur only optionnss|`|NTUr0t3haa	The girl insulted you and rubbed it in far more than was needed to carry her point. She basically treated you like a punching bag for her hostility and anger that may have nothing to do with you.    Do not accept this kind of ill-treatment from anyone. Stay away from her; do not talk to her; if she tries to converse, tell her that she's said enough and you have nothing further to discuss. Be extremely calm and firm when you say it. This will surprise her and command her respect. But you can't waver. Keep telling her, "I don't wish to expose myself to further insults, thanks."|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Sweetie, she's not your friend anymore.  She made it really clear that she does not want to be your friend anymore, and even if you try hard not to fight, you've gone in different directions.  She apparently has been giving you hints about this that you have overlooked. I am sure it's very upsetting, but honestly, at this point, it is not a loss because she is REALLY hostile to you.  You will get over it - you will focus more on other friends, but please don't try to make it right with her - it is over.  I'm thinking you weren't really listening clearly to what she was saying.  I don't think she lied to you - I think you've been having two completely different conversations for the last 6 months or so.|`|2wiCDt0gaa	don't worry  this same exact thing has happened to me and i felt the same way too  that i hd been lied to an what no  but there's nothing to worry about  somethings probably on her mind and she feels left out  there's only so much you can do to not have a fight  maybe somethings going on at home with her and she doesn't know who to take it out on  either that or she's just insecure about something and thinks its too embarassing to talk about  tomorrow talk to her and ask her whats up  tell her that if there's anything she wants to talk about you'll always be there for her cause your best friends!  and still if she acts like a royal pain in the bum and says those same things to you, give her time to re think about what she's done and it'll all work out!  if not than its not like you don't have other friends  i know its hard to adjust but you have to try  you can't just keep living on with the guilt that you made her hate you  its not like that!  by what you told me i think you are a friend who is very genuine and tries to hard to make those around you feel the happiness that you are feeling  don't worry about it  im like that too  just take it slowly and don't worry about a thing! its gonna be alright  take this as one of the obstacles in life and jump over it and move on  your going to find a lot of people that aren't going to like you for no reason at all  she's probably just one of them    hope my advice helped! ^_^|`|JKZUdhCPaa	Just tell her everything you're thinking and be honest. That's really the only way to do things. If you get yell back she won't take you seriously, just ask her what's going on. Are you sure you guys were really best friends though? It's more then just laughing and joking around, did you tell her everything and did you actually talk about serious things too? and is there anyone else you can hang out with?|`|9TWdWoTwaa	Shes fake. Forget about her.|`|xmzvUFR3aa	She's probably holding on to the whole boy situation. I think that you should try talking to her and resolving the issue. You can't force someone into liking you so if she decides that she doesn't want to be friends with you, you need to accept it and move on. You can still continue being friends with the same people. Your friendship with them doesn't have to end over the ending friendship of an mutual friend.|`|nA97uWdyaa	You deserve friends that are supportive and lift your spirits. When she decided to become a bitter negative person, she stopped being the friend that you knew. In the end you have no control how people are going to react to things. You can't force people to like or love you, so don't obsess over it and just focus on being the person that you want to be.
AdrWFLWZaa	The first thing you need to do is figure out if he really likes you. If he just a flirt then let it go, otherwise feel him out and see where it's going. As far as your really good friend, maybe you should try to arrange a little get-together with the two of them, you included and try to get some closure on these issues they keep coming to you about. Tread with caution, but by getting them together with you and getting everything out, maybe you can truly discover whether or not he likes you or her and keep them both as friends.|`|9lmTVu20aa	I wouldn't tell her, because she might not believe you. <br>  Instead, just keep quiet, don't go with him as men come and go, but friendships are harder to find. Just tell him that you're not interested, and don't say anything to your friend.<br>  <br>  If you were to go with him, and it didn't work out, you would be left with neither of them. They might blame you for their break-up, and things might turn nasty. On the other hand it might not. But in your position, I would just tell him I wasn't interested. Even if I was.|`|75btdWJkaa	Avoid the guy for a while. It's the best thing you can do. <br>  <br>  Answer mine? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090225122445AAm2yie">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|BfgB6l8Qaa	I wouldn't get involved, just say to them both; ' listen i think you should be telling him/her how you really feel, then sort things out together'. If they do end up breaking, perhaps talk to your friend and tell her how you felt. She may be angry, but if she was your friend, surely she should understand. But if she really does not want anything to happen between you two, choose her over boys and don't go any further than friends with this boy.
kUE3Ddktaa	You don't have any special duties, unless you've planned something like a hair appointment or a manicure. Otherwise, just ask your son and his bride if there's anything you can take care of for them that day. They may have a list of things they need help with, or they may tell you to relax and enjoy yourself.    One thing you can do is make sure that all of your family members are in their places at the right time. If your son has siblings or nieces/nephews or other relatives participating in the wedding, you can keep tabs on them and make sure they know where to be and at what time.    Depending on your relationship with the bride, she may invite you to come and get ready with her, her mother, and her bridesmaids, if that's something you'd like to do.    Otherwise, you should bask in your son's joy and enjoy the company of family and friends :)|`|0Id85yiYaa	just ask them both what they need help with.|`|ba428f6f619bfc67fa65e92c90d4c839aa	The Grooms mom is supposed to act as a fluffer for the best man.|`|yhgRaBPXaa	My mother in law and mom met the night before as well at the rehearsal dinner. She lives 12 hours away, so it was a similar position. She simply asked me what I needed and volunteered to do any last mintute details I might have forgotten. Just ask! I promise she will let you know if she needs something. It was comforting for me to know I had someone to call with any last minute thing I might have forgotten!|`|IxoazyHUaa	There isn't really anything that you have to do, but if you offer to help the bride or her mother, that would be a nice touch. Otherwise, relax and enjoy the day.|`|qhKP68eiaa	Most important thing you can do is be there for your son!  Make sure he is staying calm.  You're his mother, no other groomsmen can do what you can!      The rehersal would be a better place for you to meet and talk with the parents of the bride.  Get through the stressful part (the actual ceremony) then you can actually enjoy yourself with your new family!|`|8g51eBf1aa	Your basically just supposed to show up and get escorted to your seat right before the ceremony starts.|`|gKW1ufGbaa	Be in the crowd like everyone else, be polite and bring your checkbook for the rehearsal dinner.|`|vdgQKhuPaa	I would suggest you at least make a phone call to the bride's parents out of courtesy to introduce yourself and let them know what you are willing to help out with.  Also call the groom, and the bride as well.  Do not be surprised if they say they don't need anything, but at least you are offering.    The day of the event you should float around from person to person introducing yourself and asking if they need help with anything.  Pinning flowers on, putting the programs on display, there are a lot of "little" things that are also very important that you may be able to help with.    Your focus should be on helping your son and future daughter in law "host" the event or do whatever may be necessary to reduce THEIR stress levels.   Do not smother either the bride or groom, although you want to wish them well and give them some attention before the ceremony.  Walk around and greet guests and assist with final details of the event.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	hmmm, it would have been nice to meet the bride's family before the rehearsal.  you should call her parents and ask if there's anything they need done on saturday, like someone to pick up flowers, tuxes for the groomsmen, drive the girls to get their hair done, etc.  there must be some little job you can do to involve yourself with that side of the family and get to know them.  but don't be offended if they don't need your help, just be available and not pushy.
8YfYh3y0aa	Tell them that your teachers are getting suspicious and you have to stop. Don't tell them anything else.       Remember this situation, ok.   This is one of those problems that you could have avoided if you'd only made the moral choice in the first place.
ZSEgGaWoaa	wow!1 i really like that.  it has a lot of emotion. tell me when u get published....lol|`|iLKnmyAMaa	yeah, the similes kinda suck and are super cheesy. but other than that, it's pretty good. i can't believe you're only thirteen and wrote this!|`|vkPlX2Y4aa	Get rid of the horrible similes and metaphors. Other than that, good job.|`|r0u3QQvjaa	wow. that's really good.<br>  now i want to know what happens!!!|`|hH2XYpetaa	What the hell man you wasted my time reading that. lol|`|ed9248042408189d059a06605d257603aa	Needs some work. But its a got plot. Nice use of imagery.|`|maTZFIkfaa	Really good, I'm 13 too and I couldn't write anywhere near as well as that! Keep going !!!|`|i0DEBCUTaa	im impressed very good i wanted to read more|`|UTZC8dlHaa	So, this is an interesting, but what is your question, dear?
jmq2i59Jaa	WoW for a 13 yr old that's a great start.|`|onbwN4csaa	That's great keep the story going.|`|vzm8osnIaa	Well, if she went deaf how could she hear the sound?<br>  <br>  Don't put except twice, it just does not look right.<br>  <br>  Other than that, looks good I guess.|`|A73ForyRaa	im confused but it sounds interesting  =]
y9CgveCGaa	I would say he was probably trying to put off telling you he wasn't interested by saying reschedule.  It's also possible that he's just swamped or something is going on in his life and he's got all relationship stuff on the back burner.  The only real way to know is to make contact.  Maybe be patient.
AA11397003	if you wanted your car cleaned you should attach s-x to that offer !|`|deAyKj2Uaa	maybe you should have said, "hey hun, would you mind brushing off my car?"  just assuming that he should be doing this is selfish.  have you ever thought about cleaning off his car?|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	Just because you are in a relationship, it doesn't make your significant other your servant or slave.      BTW, it is your own car, and since you have use of your arms and legs (I am assuming), do it yourself.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	I guess the honeymoon's over, or he's mad at you.  when my bf leaves my apt he clears the snow off my car ;)  but we don't live together so it's not like he does it every time it snows.  and I always thank him profusely for doing it, because it's sweet.  but it's not something you should expect, if you have a sense of entitlement about someone doing you a favor, they're less likely to want to do it.|`|AA10378447	Most guys will do this for their wives if they know the wife needs to go somewhere, and he's not going somewhere himself, and thus has time to do it.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Are you for real? It's your vehicle so you are fully responsible for it. It isn't anyone else's job or obligation to be your personal slave just because you are too lazy.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	wouldn't it be nice?  lol  unfortunately women's lib movement decades ago really changed our lives and not always for the better.   for example women no longer 'exude' feminity and helplessness like they did decades ago. women want equal pay, equality in all factors of their lives, they want to climb that corporate ladder alongside the men, they want to be plumbers and electricians which are traditionally men's jobs. we want the right to go be on the front line with the men in war.  sadly all this has culminated in the fact that we aren't really considered to be the weaker sex any more.    no longer are doors automatically opened for us by the men, no longer do men offer you their seat on the bus, or offer to carry our bags.  before everyone starts giving me thumbs down i realize some men still do and yes i realize some women aren't appreciative of it when you do offer assistance but it all comes down to  "yes you have to clean the snow off your own suv"    welcome to the real world sweetie!  its not always fun!|`|AA11603468	If you want something done by someone other than yourself, you ask-and you ask politely. You don't expect or demand anyone else do anything for you-especially without you even asking. When you think like that, you set yourself up to be disappointed rather than excited when someone does something extra for you.|`|55zWUXcUaa	Um is it your car or your significant other's?  Who uses the car?  Who ever is using it should have to clean it, end of story.  My fiance and I each clean off our own cars... Well actually now we work together so we both clean off only one car in the morning to drive to work in and then the other later.  Still though we split the work evenly as it should be.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	You said yourself that it was your own SUV.  I am guessing that is the reason.|`|cdL4wzGbaa	Cause thats your car.Duh|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	If you want to drive it, you should be willing to clean it off. If you're not going anywhere, just forget it and wait til the snow melts.|`|7d65453e3d628e90746acdacb5c61c16aa	you shouldn't have to. if he's available, and he's not incapacitated...then you shouldn't have to ask.|`|di6p10Ifaa	Because you have two hands. He is your husband not your servant. Maybe he wanted you to clean off his vehicle.
5fdgfNCRaa	I admire your dedication to your friend. <br>  There is a point, however, where you just need to let go and let her figure it out for herself. She thinks she knows better than you do. She should see the pattern. She chooses a bad guy, she gets her heart broken. <br>  Let her know that she can go ahead being as destructive to herself as she wants - it's not hurting you or any relationship you have/had/will have. If she wants to do this and let herself be torn to the ground every tme she gets played, let her go ahead and do it.<br>  <br>  She'll learn sooner or later.<br>  <br>  It'll hurt, but sometimes that's just the way people get things into their thick skulls.|`|0udjgaoBaa	She needs to just date and have fun...Why do people think they need to be in a rltpsh all the time? If she chooses to chill with him let her she knows what to expect and that's all that matters|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Just stay out of it.  From what I can tell, it seems that you tried telling her for so many times.  If not, she wouldn't listen to you.  She needs to realize on her own.|`|kHSPH0RBaa	JUST TELL HER THAT, YUHH LUV HER AND YUHH DONT WANNA C HER GET HURT ANYMORE, YOUR JUST TRYiNG TO HELP HER BECAUSE THATZ WHAT BESTiES DO, GOOD LUCK =]]|`|qbnrzyCZaa	Say: I really care about you and you should think about going out with this guy because I'm scared you're going to get hurt again and I hate just picking up the pieces to your messes. -look at her serious- and then -sigh- and  get away from her and she'll folo your advice|`|LRHjirzhaa	I would tell her that you're just concerned for her and worried that she might get hurt again. Ultimately it's her decision, though so you can't really force her to do what you want her to do. Some people just don't know when to let a jerk go!<br>  <br>  (P.S. No offense, but you don't have to capitalize the first letter of every word, it's distracting when you're reading!)|`|BkzbJCHIaa	Get her alone. Tell her that i love you and i dont want to see you get hurt you know me and i know you he is not right for you you can do so much better. Because you are pretty, smart, And funny|`|qT5rKKYKaa	you should talk to her in person and say "I think you should be careful about your boyfriend.  I don't want him to hurt you. You know I love you and just want to protect you."<br>  <br>  hope it works!|`|ChmuSKpVaa	tell her that if she really cared about herself she wouldn't do that, and that you will not always be there  to pick the pieces up because of her mistakes.|`|u2BVwAKNaa	Maybe she needs to get hurt<br>  Just ignore it and don't say anything anymore and see what happens..|`|gL5jy3Sqaa	why is all the letter in caps...looks ******* weird...|`|69hjhpYqaa	introduce her to a GOOD guy|`|e7lLnyGQaa	i think you really need to tell your friend that you don't want her to be mad at you, but you really think its a bad idea and she's setting herself up to get hurt. if she gets defensive then tell her that you're just saying this for her own good because you would feel badly if she did get hurt and you could have stopped it but didn't. let her know that you care enough to be honest with her.|`|8gYGNnNzaa	well have you confronted her baout this subject before? if not then go ahead and tell her everything thats on your mind. warning though she might get mad and say/think that you are just jealous but she'll get over that quickly hopefully. if you have told her these type of things before then well tell her you want to be there for her but quite frankly you are tired of being her crying shoulder everytime she messes up. hope this helps|`|SdmwrVpbaa	Sometimes some people just run out in traffic, some smoke, some do drug, some go with bad people.  you have done what you can do by warning her. She wants this guy. Nothing else you can do. Just keep your nose clean and do what's right for you. If she needs you later, don't say " I told you so"... Just take her to a movie or a party to get her mind off the mistake.  Watch - they will probably get married.  Ha!  It happens!!!!|`|WrShwuBFaa	Just tell her how you truly feel. That's the only way. Don't be to hard on her. Maybe he'll change, but we don't know that for a fact. Just trust your instincts & follow how you feel, but by all means, you should just talk to her.

She has been warned.|`|CGKzXHBaaa	Tell her what you really feel and then tell her that you just don't want her to get hurt. You have to be really honest with each other.|`|mBlI1L6saa	If she won't listen to you, once she gets hurt again, let her come crying back to you and say "I told you so".|`|cuRRz1z3aa	tel her how u feel and if she still wont listen get more friends and some of the girls hes dated (or dating) and if she still wont listen you need 2 get a adult involved|`|21087505291a72143d1a801532d3bb7faa	just tell her that you care for her a lot and she has to to just be patient and wait, the right guy will come around.|`|o9VsZAn9aa	it sounds like you already told her and just be there for her when he does hurt her|`|107a0773bc35893a858dda96ecb238b2aa	wow she seems to have problems...<br>  um... <br>  try and tell here in a nice way about this.<br>  and hope she don't read this question! lol|`|LssD4F8Yaa	let her do it it will teach her a lesson|`|HMv6jvUCaa	Than don't pick up the pieces anymore.<br>  <br>  She sounds like a glutton for punishment.

JCAgvgTxaa	I think your dad is more than fair . . . paying for 30 guests on your side and an additional 30 on the groom's side.<br>  <br>  I think what dad has said is an excellent plan . . . "dad has said that if my fiancee's family wants more than 30 they can pay for the extra people."<br>  <br>  So fiance's family has two options<br>  1.  Cut their guest list to 30<br>  or<br>  2.  Pay for their additional guests.  (If fiance feels he must have more than 30 guests, perhaps he can take on a second job part-time, just temporarily?)<br>  <br>  I think your father has been kind and generous . . . and perfectly fair.  And I hope you two are thanking him profusely.  <br>  <br>  Cos he could have said, "If two people are mature enough to wed, then they are mature enough to pay for their own wedding and reception.  You two are on your own."  <br>  <br>  But he did not say that.  He is giving you a generous gift.  You and your fiance should not ask for more.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	you accept what he offers you graciously and you and your fiance cover whatever parents do not<br>  <br>   consider yourself lucky he is contributing anything.<br>  <br>   so either you and FH need to come up with some cash quick or start cutting guests.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	uh-yes. You cannot force someone to pay for something that is for you! I suggest that you and your fiance come up with the 3k if you want more people. It is quite ordinary. I paid for my wedding-everything. <br>  <br>  Thank your father for his generosity.|`|AA11312653	Back in the days when brides were helpless young things going from the support and protection of Daddy to the support and protection of Hubby, the usually formula was the guest slots to be divided up 40-40-20, with 40% for the bride's family, 40% for the groom's family, and 20% for the couple's younger set of friends. <br>  <br>  It is not your father's responsibility that your future in-laws have a large family, nor is it his concern that they wish to entertain their relatives at a nice party without having the financial means to do so. . If they are assigned 50% of the guest slots, they have no legitimate cause for complaint. If your future in-laws with to entertain this large group in some way that is within their limited means, such as a pancake supper or tea party, there is nothing to prevent them from doing so. <br>  <br>  Ones marriage is an important milestone, but no milestone is so important that one should use it to bully, blackmail, browbeat, or otherwise bludgeon people into taking on expenses that they do not wish to take on.|`|HJ0YTWjVaa	My four year old was singing a song yesterday and this question made me think of it...... "Be happy with what you got, Be happy with what you got" Pay for the rest yourself if you want more or if they can't afford to.UGGGGHHHH you could be paying for it all!|`|jPJ9MTCwaa	If his famiyl can't help out, then it falls on you and your fiance to take care of the excess.  Get jobs, put off the wedding for a year if need be, cut down on the cost or cut the guest list.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	You figure out the budget first and then make your guest list based on what you can afford.|`|M7CdgSNSaa	My parents are paying for my reception and they said that they would get to invite 50 me and my fiance would get to invite 50 and my fiances parents could invite 50. If they go over they pay. It is far when there is a certain # of people that they can afford to pay for. (We got a good deal its about $15 per a person that's why we will be inviting 150 people)|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	When a gift is offered, you accpet it graciously. Be glad he will be paying for anything and make up the difference yourselves. Your dad told you what he can/will pay, you either cut the list down or you pay for it by saving your own money. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|pfjxEZBmaa	That's a LOT of money per person for just your dad to take care of. Even if your fiance has a bigger family, its not fair to your dad to make him pay more. He'll have to cut down. People will understand.|`|tzPEckiZaa	Yes, it's absolutely fair. <br>  If you want more people, either have your fiance's family pay, or pay for it yourself.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	Why so much per person?????  That is a crazy amount per person.  I am siding with your dad on this on.|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Your Dad is being very very generous.  It is more than fair.|`|sLwmzvi8aa	the cost should be split in half... it makes it nice that way|`|qRIMM2ycaa	Yes that's perfectly fair.<br>  What's not fair is expecting something for nothing, and then complaining about restrictions.<br>  <br>  If they want to invite a ridiculous amount of guests, they should not expect it to be paid for by someone else.<br>  Your father is very generous to pay for 30 on both sides.<br>  <br>  Traditionally the Bride's family may have paid for the reception and ceremony, but in this day and age, it would be more common for YOU to pay it yourself.<br>  If you cannot afford to throw a huge wedding, that is life. Life is neither fair nor unfair.<br>  You invite less people, or find a way to pay for it.|`|239548019a89f1b3358d72761eef3170aa	That is almost 6,000, maybe you can find another venue and use the 6,000 to pay for all of the food. Or you will need to pay for the rest with your fiancee'. Your Dad is doing a great deal, it sounds like you are Daddys little girl and use to getting her way.

YYAu9lFDaa	just stop worrying about it and let him come to you.
qroOTyrGaa	Give her space. If you give her space she will see you're not smothering her and realize that you're not trying to control her. In regards to cutting the filters off of her cigarettes, I'm sure that you did it because you love her but if she was in an abusive relationship before that probably means that he was controlling, so as hard as it is you can't do stuff like that anymore. You can show her facts about why it's harmful to her health and you can lovingly say you want her to be healthy but you can't force her to do anything. Remember: love is patient, love is kind
e87cd8e8c653d0f68402573b2d9f3ef1aa	Kick his *** to the curb right this minute! If he doesn't appriciate you and what you do for him, he's SO not worth your time.  My ex was exactly the same way for 2 years.. he never changed... always spent his money on porn for himself.. bought me a $2 sticker for our 2 year anniversary.. and I snapped.. The next day while he was at work I threw all his **** outside onto the patio and changed the locks.     He should be more worried about you leaving him.  Do not let him try to hold onto you when you make your exit.. If he agrees with whatever you tell him just say you're glad you understand each other and leave.  Let the jerk stew.    Afterward go out and have some fun! You might meet someone=)    PS. If his name ain't on the cheque and he didn't sweat for it, it ain't his and he isn't entitled to it.

From what your saying it seems like he really has no reason to leave you because he's the one causing the problems if he is leaving it's for something in his head that he's not telling you about.  And for the child, well if he's not helping then it would be the same with or without him.  I say you let him know about how you are feeling, and give him a chance to change if he is willing to.  If he's not willing then I say you leave.  But don't do what these answers say unless you know that it's right in your heart.  I hope everything works out with you.

OWjbg4GYaa	No matter what you do, the problem will always be there because like it or not she is part of that family, eighter you get use to it or you get out of the relationship. Alcoholism is a big problem, it runs in my family, therefore I been to so many groups for alcoholics and what I found out is that everyone in the family is affected by the alcoholism of someone else even if they dont't drink. Now you did said that she is a little bit crazy, if by that you meen she is not emotionally stable then that's because of all the problems in her family and things won't get better until she gets help.
AA10952386	As much as it hurts, cut their friendships as a loss.<br>  If you are not speaking/communicating with them, there will be nothing they can start a rumor about you. The longer you go without speaking to them, the less they should have to say about you (don't give them any amunition).<br>  You are very young - and there are plenty of opportunities coming where you can make friends that will not go against you. When I was 13, I had 2 friends who turned against me. I just let time pass until they both came to me and we all talked it over.<br>  Do not initiate a conversation with them about what their problem is. I am 28 years old - the older you get, the more you will realize that some friendships are not worth the negative energy and attention you are giving them. <br>  Do you really want friends who talk about you behind your back and hate you "for no reason?"...In my eyes, they've already breached your trust and contract of friendship by hurting your feelings. <br>  Don't give them anything to talk about. Ignore them until you graduate from school and find yourself a classier group of people who will be there for you instead of causing you to be upset and post a question on Yahoo A!<br>  Good luck, and hang in there! =)|`|61WgRcntaa	Right, well i'm speeking from experiance here. If your going the the same thing as i was, which by the looks of things you are then you simpily have to continue to ignore them. Whatever you do, do not make rumours up about them and then spread them round, just because they have done that to you, in the long run it doesn't work out and you end up getting into trouble when you didn't need to. <br>  Tell yourself that you honestly haven't done anything wrong, and haven't done anything to deserve what they are saying about you, if it begins to bug you, tell someone, the sooner the better because that kinda thing has the potential to get worse as oposed to better.<br>   How long have you been best friends with them, before all this? If it wasn't a very long time then unfortunatly chances are they where using you, and have just got bored of you, and because you relatiated by ignoring them then they are trying to get some form of payback. <br>  However if you have been best friends with them for a long time then that kinda makes things different, maybe they developed different interests in you, or simply do not want to be your friend anymore. Either way they should have told you how they felt. <br>  You can't really do anything about it, apart to continue to ignore them. If you really want to be friends with them then you can try talking to them privatly and asking what brought all this up, and why they are treating you like this. If you are going to do this, then explain to them exactly why you ignored them, and if they won't be your friend again then the least they can do is stop making up rumours about you. Otherwise just try and make some new friends, they don't really sound that brilliant mates if they are going to hate you for no reason and then make rumours about you when you ignore them. They are doing it for attention and are just desperate really,You sound like a nice person so i don't think that making new friends would be hard for you.<br>  Good Luck with whatever you decide to do :)<br>  Byee <br>  P.s hope i managed to help!
kItRaRmlaa	NO|`|jjhHnCB1aa	Noo how about you just send e-mails instead?|`|60ApQsGOaa	lol if you already know your parents don't approve, then why are you asking?|`|PGQoh45Uaa	Nah she could be an evil ninja from Germany.    If you need help just whistle 67 times, do 45 cartwheels,  jump off a cliff.  and then maybe, just maybe, i would come and help you.  oh did I mention, you need to pay $12,300 for hiring me,  and an extra $123,000 if i get hurt,  Okayy. =]|`|qslROmIMaa	well yeah a p.o box would be good. and no i wouldnt do it. no matter how long you have been doing it. but there is always a chance, nothing is wrong. but still, whats the differnce between mail & online. except online will get it to you faster. so just say sorry, but if you really want to (i wouldnt, but if you do) look at what kind of site it is.  personally, i would stick to online.|`|vHCRW6IAaa	i dont think it would be save! dont do it|`|iBGkSg50aa	Don't do it. Stick with talking online. Or get a P.O. Box.|`|Ohncxt5Oaa	if you know HER adress and now how she LOOKS like then, yea, its aight|`|8AaPQONGaa	CANADIAN!!!!!!!!!! >:D|`|Xo8XZVGbaa	Its better to be safe then sorry.  I wouldn't give out the address.|`|WInyhO09aa	I  wouldn't do it. I would just stick with online chatting for now. You never know how ppl are these days.|`|6sAddKd6aa	yea the girl says shes form germany....but she can  be a 40year old guy right down the street|`|6jKJCuqgaa	don't give it  jus have like a PO box|`|FcXruBUaaa	DONT DO IT!!! it migh all be fake and i dont see how sending letters and stuff  is better then talking online, who wud wanna rite a letter?!!|`|jBB7OPXBaa	Better safe than sorry I wouldn't give out your address unless you have met this girl in person and know her really well.    But that's just my opinion... do what you think is rite.  =)
el8yX5q3aa	Go to the AA meetings with him and learn about this disease.  ONLY then can you know what he is going through and how to NOT enable him should he fall...and know what to do to help him get up again.  This is a LOT of support when you do that.....    GO to the AA meetings or Al Anon meetings.....|`|VMY7No0eaa	he needs to get professional help especially if he was a heavy drinker.  otherwise he can go into DT's and this can be life threatening.|`|tVluPTPraa	spend time together. if you are occupying his time then he wont think about alcohol|`|YMnTveWuaa	More sex. It works for me. When I am ballin' the ol' lady, I don't even think about drinking.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Yes, please start going to Al-Anon.  This will help you to figure out what is going on, and not to impede his progress or be an enabler.  You will learn a lot and get a lot of support for YOU - which is what you need.  It will help you to understand that this is his journey.  And there are even issues with sobriety - you need to learn this.  Starting with AA for him is important - but he will be spending a lot of time and focus on that (newbies are supposed to attend 90 meetings in 90 days).  If you don't understand his struggle, then you may feel threatened and really undermine his progress.|`|AA12346188	Not provoking him to drink and stop drinking your self.|`|AA11172209	call ur alonon office|`|U5IigAByaa	i haven't been in the situation, so can't really advise, but i know there are support groups for the loved ones of alcoholics. maybe his group can give you more info?|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Basically just be there for him, listen when he needs to talk, be  understanding and make sure to try to avoid situations where alcohol is involved...|`|NWwGl4k6aa	don't drink in front of him or take him to places where the temptation might arise.|`|cj4nIaQTaa	Give him lots of encouragement. he has to do it n his own. You are going to have to stop hanging out with friends who drink and stay away from bars and clubs. GOOD LUCK!|`|qslROmIMaa	well first of all dont drink around him, and try not to have it in his face, like dont take him to a club. you dont want anything to tempt him. and when ever he gets tempted to drink, he should have something (none achoalic-mabey candy? or juice?-dont use cigarettes or something like it..my aunt did that.. now she has a problem with smoking.) to take his mind off it. and tell others, to please not drink around him.|`|e6657aae9a5e6165c0768975ea7fd38daa	just pray for him and keep him going to aa|`|4Dc44BC5aa	Be a strong nonjudgmental support system, encourage AA, don't get mad when he goes to his meetings. Respect he is going to be irritable, but don't engage a fight, don't drink around him or talk about it, make sure he removes his "buddies" that he drank with. Help him be less stressed, get more physical go for a walk together after dinner, be more intimate... exercise really helps and if you do it together it's a double bonus.|`|WBpVZpb0aa	Just support him. Be there for him. Figure out fun activities or outings in which drinking isn't part of the night. I think the most important thing will be getting him a new hobie, something else to focus on so it's not so unbearable.|`|CttJ6OBJaa	just talk to him and do things with him be a diffrent girl show him a diffrent side of you in a good way to take his mind off that
AA10737138	Just stop putting out and take him out and get him drunk and pass him off to a drunk chick, then when his hormones take over get pissed at him for cheating on you and problem solved.|`|Zvf6ulXnaa	who cares if he knows where you live or any of that crap. i learned the hard way that living to make other people happy only screws you over in the long run. You need to do what makes you happy. you need to push other peoples feelings aside and do something for you. dont worry about how he feels cuz if he truly does care he should understand. some relationships are better when they dont exsist. Your life your happiness but your overall choice.|`|dbQHlp85aa	ha ha.. how old are you little sister.     Too young to be tied to one person I'm willing to bet.     Just let your friend down easily.. he's young too.. he'll recover.. I promise.|`|GV8h48Wqaa	hmm.. a toughy. but you've got to make the decision.   who do you like more?   your boyfriend who you "sort of like"?  or the guy you barely know you have a crush on?  it sounds like your not even ready for dating.  i think the crush will pass|`|zTjW1O5aaa	its best to break up with him just say "i love you but more as a friend"  but it is better to break up with him now because he will get more attached and be even more heartbroke the long you leave it. If he loves you that much he would probably understand and want you as a friend than nothing at all so keep being friends     good luck :)|`|QOX0Op0Iaa	You're putting too much feeling into this. You can't make everybody happy, so you need to put your happiness first, and if that happiness is with another guy, so be it. Every moment that you're with the wrong guy, is one moment less he has to meet the right girl for him.|`|v3JcRTpCaa	idk
dwHnazEJaa	LMFAO make a movie!  mess your room...LOL    Best answer please!!|`|a796jDdlaa	prank call  fix each other's hair  Watch a few movies *add popcorn*  Act like idiots(thats what we do..lol)  Give each other make overs!  Paint each others nails(included in make over)   call some boys maybe  Dance to ur fav music  Make some videos(very fun!)  Get on the internet (msn together)  Have girl to girl chats(about: boys, hair, fashion, etc...)    HAVE FUN!|`|MjbLGaegaa	talk about boys you like  play stupid childhood games  have a mid-night feast  dance  watch a movie  stay up all night|`|yhQPAQaFaa	watch a film and play truth or dare maybe|`|S7DmmIwraa	Watch a movie and make up stories.|`|oCaf3238aa	play truth or dare  watch stupid love movies  make-up  hair  take stupid, crazy pictures  talk about hot guys  go mess with random people at walmart =D  make mix cds of all your favorite songs  dance around like idiots  take videos  call/text random numbers  prank call ur haterz      hoope i helped. thats wat me and my friends do all the time!
da2KJ9fXaa	yeah rub it in his face :] just kidding, no tell him to try again and that maybe someday he'llbe good like you.|`|nfua6A4paa	i got a 35 i should rub it in your face hahahah..noooo thats childish grow up man. if you do that than your no better than anybody... now indays the act of putting sumone inshame is not the answer and thats not what life is about..especially if you believ in charma.. its a *****. a good friend would cheer him up and help him study so that he or she can do better next time.... listen the way i got thru highschool/college is to help eachother out and youll relize that when you mature.... ladies dont like that childish crap  remeber that.. unless your drunk, but thats diff story|`|CVunGyIpaa	No. some poeple just learn differently and have more trouble understanding things. Dont be mean!|`|iOI2RT6maa	No. I got a 35, my wife got a 17. She's better at some stuff than I am, and I'm better at some stuff than she is.    Do I rub it in? No. It's no big deal.    The ACT doesn't prove anything at all. All the ACT tests is how well you can take the ACT. Proven fact.    You may be good at a test, but what if your friend is better at life?  Think he would rub it in? Or try to help out those who need help?|`|wzXJOSIeaa	UM NO! That's just mean!|`|Tv8cuXmtaa	When you fail a big test like that that bad you dont want to hear about it so make fun of him a little but don't go overboad or they will really get pissed.  I had the same situation i was only a 29 though|`|acdf2a2c14fccbe7a3badc5fa8d3abe1aa	No, That is mean.  you are supposed to be his friend.... he probably needs cheering up.
o7gckZ2Paa	Well, not trying to argue, but first you said that you knew he was innocent, but then you said " In the end he was wrong". So which is it?<br>  Does he deserve to be reprimanded for what was done or not?<br>  <br>  He probably looks at you as more than just a friend or a FWB. That's why he's calling you in his time of need. He's probably not calling his homeboys, because he knows they can't help him out. He knows that you might though. Or its that he depends on you more.<br>  <br>  You say he's a "really great guy", but then you say "but he smokes weed which I dont condone". <br>  <br>  He has a lifestyle that you don't agree with. Ask yourself this...Is he worht possibly losing your job over? That's what might happen if you mix business with pleasure. Its a conflict of interest. And if you did lose your job over it, is he going to still be calling you when you CAN'T hook him up? Also...you said you're sleeping with him...WHY? He can't get his life together and constantly gets into trouble with the law. What were to happen if you got pregnant? I don't care how "safe" people are, there's always a chance of pregnancy. Would you want to be associated with this guy forever because he's your "baby's daddy"? He doesn't sound like he would be a good role model for a child. <br>  <br>  I think that if he's worth putting your job in jeopardy or getting pregnant bym, then try to hook him up. If he's not...cut him off, let him serve his time, let him change (IF he can), and then see what happens after that.<br>  <br>  You're probably not going to listen, because people in lust are unable to be rational, but try to think about it. After all, you wouldn't be asking us if it wasn't already on your mind.|`|jmq2i59Jaa	my gut reaction is don't pull any strings or anything else let this be a wake up call he needs to grow up. you see all that is both right and wrong but remember there are plenty of good men left if you look for them! he will in the end cost you your job because he will get caught maybe in your house or car with illegal substance. an maybe you in there at the same time. to which you will have to answer. So in my humble opinion leave him be an let him learn. Sorry to be so callus but life is hard with out letting someone like him make it harder|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	this is his wake up call, let it take it's course. Do not intervene  on this one. His little kid is counting on you to help turn him into a real man this time. Dont let him down, or do the same actions expecting diffrent results.<br>  <br>  just a thought,<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  Cheers
lMKy9Ho8aa	he wants his cake and eat it too! it's obvious!! he doesn't want a relationship with you; but,.neither does he want you to be in a committed relationship with someone else! that is pure selfishness! If you continue to give it up, he's not going to change! Why should he??!!|`|20Hpqmuzaa	he thinks ur always going to  be his....|`|fPx4lwofaa	if you aren't together, it is none of his business if you are talking to any dudes or looking for another boyfriend, another boyfriend? he isn't your boyfriend so if you are looking for someone else go for it. he wants you to be there when he is horny and that is it. keeps you on a hook by saying he isn't ready to commit yet. you should tell him you wont have sex with him anymore until he is ready to commit and see what he does then. he is using you.|`|bEaJHY1uaa	right now y'all are bed buddies... but i think he doesn't want you to be with other guys he wants you to be open to him only. He doesn't want to be tied down to you yet but he doesn't want you nore him to be really single.... so i'm guessing that's a good thing... sounds promising to me.|`|w7g4eGqFaa	hes just concern<br>  since hes your bby daddy then maybe theres still a spark out there<br>  ahah! just go with the flow and see where it leads you(:|`|PtSeJXnEaa	classic case of 'why buy the cow when u get the milk for free?'|`|bCGfqfi1aa	Hes jelious, or is hiding something my boyfreind asked me stuff like that when he was cheating on me, dont jump to that conclusion though, he loves you and hes worried because hesn to ready for comitment that you are and you are willing to find it else where. tell him it bothersy ou and that you wouldnt do that to him. but be careful he might be trying to control you, some guys are really hard to read. and most guys are scared of forever, if you have a child then he is prob scared to death of actually having to be his father and marrage.|`|VJqDtuoPaa	Because every man wants to be the only man. Thats why he's asking if you are seeing anyone else. He probably already is but cant stomach that you may be seeing someone and possibly having him around your child. You may have to decide whether or not you want to move on...or remind him it was his choice to want to take is slow and not be commited. So if you do date its none of his business.|`|K7fsiaIgaa	yeah, he's afraid of commitment, and he is completely selfish. who knows if he will ever stop acting like that. I'd say to ditch him till you are positive he's changed. till he's "ready to be fully committed" and don't feel guilty if you wanna date other guys till then. if you are no both fully committed it's not like he owns you.|`|kfM7ppWpaa	Sounds to me like he wants to keep messing around with you to keep you close, but he is also messing around with other women. I bet he would be extremely jealous if you told him that you met some guy. Try it just to see.....|`|b53k0EZkaa	okay....he is INLOVE with you keep him forever and hit his butt....it might turn him on or grab his penis -----8->o|`|qMPUCQCNaa	Hey i was in a relationship like that and what you have to do is, stop sleeping  with him, and lay down some ground rules. 1. No more sex, think about why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free. 2. no more asking about your personal life, and you don't need to know about his, what you do is your business and your business only, he just wants to know to see if you are going to leave him, believe me he wants to be there but you make it way to easy for him. Try this go out and get a hair cut or a different hair color, start looking like a new women, and one night ask him if he could watch the baby while you go go with a friend, never tell him if it's a male friend or a female friend, even if you have to go ride around town by yourself make him feel as if you have someone else, then he will commit to you and you only trust me on this I done it before and it really works. He don't want to lose you and right now you allowed him to put you second, him saying that he isn't ready to make a full comment to you is BS.  I can tell you that if you act like you have someone else he will comcommit you.
gJPlY1ADaa	well i would say that you are not over your first love and that is understandable sweetie....it takes some people forever to get over their first love......but this is how you will know if you are over him, if you get a chance to get even with him and you don't take it then you don't care anymore and if you realize that you haven't thought about him lately then you pushed him out of your mind....don't be so hard on yourself it's okay to still think about him as long as your not stalking him then you are cool....just don't let him mess up your future relationships|`|OQXQkU7Zaa	aww thats so sweet i have the same problem!|`|HHniTZTbaa	It sounds like you needed to split up. It might still be raw when you see him, but you shouldn't go back out with him. Just try take your mind off him. Or if it actually would help, call him and just get some closure. If you go out again though it probably wouldn't work out. I know how you'd feel when you saw him. It would be a huge shock. You'll know when you have fallen out of love when you don't care if he goes out with other girls, you just smile when you think about what you had, and that you were lucky to have it. First love is the hardest but in a few years you'll be over it. It's hard but it gets easier. Hope it helped xx|`|sg9ET4vkaa	This may not be the right answer but I wasn't completely over my ex until I found someone better. I broke up with my ex in 2003 and I still thought about him and we had friends in common but I avoided ever seeing him because it would hurt too much. I dated around but in 2008 I met the love of my life! I'm so happy with the guy I'm with now. I recently started using facebook and found out that my ex was married with 2 kids! But because of who I'm with now I didn't even care what happened in my life and in a way was happy for him to have found someone else to love too.|`|rU1UyOAlaa	you'll know....<br>  <br>  it just stops.|`|VXiMtwIsaa	Your so not over him...if you still wont the relationship then call and see what he thinks but he has a GF so that up to you. Good Luck! =D
lmESBQb7aa	I think your best bet is too consult a DJ. I'm sure they have had previous requests similar to yours, and they probably know exactly what songs you would like for your wedding that are funky!|`|NPmRmnG6aa	When we cut our cake we had Eat It by Weird Al playing. I totally loved! Two months later we went to my husbands step-sister's wedding and se played the same song!

Be honest!!!  Let her know you are worried.|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Tell your friend that you would love to hang out with her but that you don't want to be cause of tension between her and her bf.  Tell her if she can't tell him about the two of you hanging out together, then it might be best to keep your contact to phone and email.  I would also try and advise the friend to find a boyfriend who isn't so controlling, cause dammmmn people need to have friends and hang out with them!|`|ygGr1nX7aa	You should probably just tell her straight out- "Sorry, I'd love to hang out but I'm not comfortable meeting behind his back, because I don't need to be caught up in his reaction if he finds out."  You don't need to deal with that, and you'll probably be doing her a favour- she needs to either stand up to him or ditch him sooner or later anyway.|`|LKbH8Xunaa	she needs to leave him or she will be in a big problem or satuation where she can't get off <br>  she needs to leave him rite now before it gets worse|`|dX4Dll0yaa	I would explain to your friend why you think her boyfriend is unhealthy(because let's face it he is). Not allowing someone to do as they please can be a sign of deeper problems. I would talk to her about it - tell he you support her and want her to be in a healthy relationship. I would be less concerned about your safety(not that you should ignore it), and more concerned about hers. If you think he might beat you up, think of what he may do to her for not listening to him. I had a boyfriend who would verbally and emotionally abuse ME if I talked to someone I wasn't supposed to. He did nothing to them. Of course, he may be a really great guy just looking out for his girl, but this is doubtful if he is forcing her not to see you (as opposed to advising). In summary, I would talk to here and let her know you see a problem.|`|I5VvAniXaa	ask ur friend to get a man with a real job. u don't have to be afraid of him, that's y we have cops and pay taxes and etc.|`|K5rWdGi6aa	Dump tat old fart n get on with yr life. No one should have "control" over anyone like making friends.|`|XRBbiG4Naa	tell your friend its either you or her boyfriend
CEKAqtB1aa	Jealousy?|`|t1ecTYWRaa	This dude is obviously jealous of you.|`|F2lUn0moaa	Maybe ask mutual friends if they know what is going on.  A friend who talks like that behind your back and won't talk to you when confronted is not a friend, I don't care how many years you have known him.  He sounds like the one with the problem, not you.
FZKFLTyLaa	Be frank, and honest. Just ask :<br>  Would it offend you if I considered you as more than just a friend (or classmate)? Do you know how much I like you?<br>  I cannot understand in this age of communications why so many people have such great difficulty<br>   just speaking to one another.
TthDWtPTaa	kick him in the nuts
NDFN04sqaa	I truly believe that YOU believe there is a spirit in your house, and it could very well be true - it really doesn't matter if its true or not if you believe it is true enough for you - that aside you sound like you are a very sensitive person and can get your feelings hurt easily - try forgiving your dad and moving on from this.  I know you sound stressed but if you forgive him you may feel a little better.|`|wZSMDrCfaa	WOW! That is some imagination you got there kid. I think maybe you need to see some psychiatric help.

xvey8ixPaa	Pack your trash and leave. get a good counselor.If he is worth being married to he will come after you and want counseling with you. If he is not worth devoting your life to then move on. It is painful, but will be worse the longer you wait.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	You need to have a long talk with him, and find out what both of your needs are, and what is missing.  You might end up at a marriage counselor.  Good luck.|`|IvMPh09baa	he's blaming you for his problems, clear and simple as that.  if he's drinking, smoking getting angry at you all the time and telling you its all your fault... then you are dealing with someone that is hiding from the real problems they are facing with themselves.  I am very sorry he is subjecting you to this... but its not your fault, really its not... you love him, you want a good marriage... unfortunately he has his head so far up his butt he can't see the light of day.<br>  <br>  i highly suggest counseling, if you are unable to calmly communicate to him your feelings and needs without him getting mad then whats the next solution to get through to your husband?  Maybe a professional couple counselor can help talk with you and your husband and get to the root of the problem here.  But first things first.. he needs to put down the booze and sober up before anything will get better. priorities my friend... marriage vs. alcohol, apparently the alcohol is more important.|`|4oWcXL5vaa	Have you asked him straight out?  Hows the relationship otehrwise?  You could always have a co-worker or aquanintance (that he doesnt know) follow him and see exactly where he is going or what hes doing.  Or check his phone/texts any wierd ones? Call them!  Good luck.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	If you don't have proof, then you don't KNOW he's cheating. You do have a lot of indicators though. Even if he isn't cheating, this sucks. You should come before all these jackballs he;s hanging out with, and you haven;t met any of them?|`|gLXzVbm8aa	confront him|`|aSSXt6tlaa	Gosh, you sound just emotionally, physically, mentally, and spiritually bankrupt.  <br>  You know, perhaps you can seek help at a local alanon meeting to address your own issues.  Fix yourself...fix your marriage, or maybe all of this is just talk, and alanon may not be right for you...alanon is a program for people willing to take good orderly direction followed by action.|`|IcNJFRYIaa	It's time for you to move one. This guy sounds like he's just not that into you. Stop wasting your time, there's plenty of fish out there. It's time you opened your eyes and realize that he doesn't want to be with you anymore. Harsh reality.|`|NGKwsawdaa	For a situation like this, If you are financially capable , try to get marriage counseling, maybe he might open up to you and really let you know what's going on.|`|kC6iAMDJaa	ask him or leave, you can't spend your life worrying he will leave, you can't stop him, if he cheats you can't stop him. just know it's not your fault his isn't a man but a jack***!|`|PumDOQC9aa	You don't want to stay with a cheater .onces a cheater is always a cheater. Even tho you love him so much he doesn't seem like he love you that much if he's treating you bad.  If he was only with his friends he would pick up and talk to you and go back hanging out with his friends  leave his ***|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	Sit down with him and talk about it. It won't be an easy conversation but it needs to be done. He'll either deny it truthfully, get defensive (which is admission) or admit it. You are not to blame! You should know his friends, their contact info and you should have access to everything. In a true loving relationship, neither partner feels the need to be secretive.|`|UFOdwXgfaa	Wow, I wouldn't want to be in your shoes that's for sure.<br>  You have to confront him and start putting your foot down. He's totally disrespecting you and playing you for a fool<br>  <br>  It's time to talk to him but don't confront him because he'll denie the whole thing. The chances of him confessing are very small so even more to the point that if you want him to spill the beans, you have to be open and listen as to what he has to say. <br>  <br>  I'm not blaming you and saying it's your fault, but maybe of you knew the reason why he's cheating, maybe you guy's be able to put your marriage back on track.<br>  <br>  It won't be easy that's why I recommend marriage counseling|`|ze7xiJwTaa	First of all, is there any chance he could be involved with drugs? Some of his behavior kind of sounds like it's possible... <br>  <br>  Second, trust your intuition. You know your husband and you know yourself. Do NOT ignore what your gut is telling you! I'm not a fan of snooping either but it sounds like you have legitimate reasons to do so. Don't let him bully you into believing his behavior is your fault. <br>  I let my husband do the same thing to me. I wouldn't have dared to look at his phone or computer etc. but when I finally could not deny it anymore evidence was all over the place. The whole time I was suspecting it, he told me I was being paranoid and would lash out at me if I tried to talk about it. Classic. <br>  If you want to save your marriage, or at least your spirit then you need to confront this. Sorry, I wish I had something more promising to say..
BYWDIhuLaa	you should tell her that you forgot all about it and that you didnt want to tell her about it because you knew she would be upset!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck hon
kfM7ppWpaa	Quit trippin! I think he will verbally tell you when he is ready. Some guys take a little longer than others.
TthDWtPTaa	she's playin you
TthDWtPTaa	she needed a laugh|`|1zfwLsQpaa	Same thing happened to me. She was stupid and for some reason she said that everything I said was racist (it wasn't, she was black and I'm Latino) and then after calling me 'racist bastard' we were leaving and she did the same thing as you and she started laughing with her friends.<br>  <br>  Wow. I wanted to half turn around and kill her and half ignore it|`|YANN4mXNaa	To see how similar it was to your face of course.
f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	I wouldn't answer and I wouldn't take him back. A guy who wants to go on vacation with other girls and not me is not a guy I would see as a potential partner. He's an ***, move on with your life because this dude has no regard for your feelings.  Dump him and tell him it is because he is a liar!
BVtnCy1vaa	Be really up front about it. You don't think the relationship is working, you'd be happy to go to the formal dinner with him as a friend but completely understand if he wants to take someone else. Explain that it's been good times (even if it hasn't, he will be feeling pretty gutted by now) but times change and things don't always work out the way you envisioned them.<br>  <br>  Tell him in person. It's mean to break up with someone via SMS.|`|gXG3bRwaaa	screw someone else and videotape it<br>  <br>  or just simply text<br>  <br>  "we're done biotchhhh"<br>  <br>  simple.
hPBnjOeDaa	today in my english class  my teacher asked me a question   and i had no idea what the answer was  i felt like a fool    i'm the same way, but the way i cope is just letting myself blush, letting myself get that really hot feeling, and convincing myself it never happened.    I'm embarrased easy :)    oh and i have anxiety, so that makes it worse    do you find you get butterflies when you're upset too?|`|pzVV7VLnaa	That's a good way to practice to overcome your problem.  Try to stay calm whenever you've been call on.|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	There's really no way to get over this. I have the same problem - no matter what I'm doing, I always start burning up and I can feel it happening, so it starts getting redder. One time I looked at my reflection and the pinky blush kinda looked cute, so now I'm not as worried about it. The only way to overcome shyness is to be bolder and get used to being the center of attention, so work on that and see what happens.|`|G4wEL4qoaa	You should take a public speaking course.  I know it sounds like the worst thing to do considering your problem, but trust me it helps.|`|GXrGwyNgaa	Just imagine all the people in your class that your talking to is naked and your the only one in the class with clothes on :) ....mmm and it that fails and makes you laugh instead or even more embarrassed ... just think that everyone else is dumb in the class and your the brains of the class|`|dvNWbUgLaa	I was like that too.  You have an anxiety problem.  You could see a therapist or even go on anxiety medication like Paxil if you need to.|`|zdfZzpE1aa	i have the same problem, when ever someone i dont know that well talks to me i get really nervous, and start like nervously itching and figiting, its really embarresing. some times i just try not thinking about it at all, but you just got to keep talking to ppl you your not comfortable with, its a part of life
lJhl3wLAaa	Dating 3 weeks and you know everything about him? Doubt it. Jealousy is bad. Never has a good outcome. Dump him now. Why go through life wondering how someone is going to react to you. You should be confident in yourself, your relationship and your partner. You shouldn't need to be validated all the time that you are good or hot. If you need that or he needs that they you both should be alone for a while and fix yourselves.|`|2Dmd1f8Laa	red flag hunny!!! bfs who r that protective end up abusing their gfs... don not stay with this guy... all dating abuse starts with jealousy|`|W84gB7FYaa	*Your Hispanic, and we know how they get/are with their men.|`|99eMR5dyaa	dont waste your time

e59bc254d8339c1ae45e999a109e63e4aa	just start up a conversations. ask her a lot of questions about herself, so she'll have something to say. and then the conversation should start warming up from there. sometimes shy ppl are just afraid that they aren't interesting enough. but if you show her that you're interested, she'll eventually get comfortable with you. You shouldn't just give up on her just because she's shy.|`|AA11991028	ask questions about her. Girls love to know they are interesting.|`|npOKn1Hiaa	Well most shy people open up after awhile. Im sure if you just keep talking to her and starting the conversation if she likes you then she will start to open up and flirt back with you, it just takes a little more effort.|`|7b5i9TG2aa	talk to her 60% of the time us women want the men to make the first move that why we act wierd sometimes lol <br>  good luck
qrI5ZH42aa	If he heard that you were planning on asking him to marry you and freaked out, you'll have to accept that you've freaked him out!  He's young and may not be ready.<br>  <br>  You need to clarify wherer you both are as he might not have heard and may have stood you up for other reasons.  Phone him, leave a message if he doesn't answer.  If you don't hear from him in a few more days leave him a "I'll consider this a break-up then" message as he's probably ignorining you.
F2ygsPEbaa	It sounds to me like he is avoiding you.  You should be worried from the standpoint of the relationship, but I wouldn't be concerned about it from a life or death perspective.<br>  <br>  When you do get back in touch with him, I think it is reasonable to ask what was going on.  If you get no answers or vague answers then you have to decide if, or to what degree you are willing to put up with this.|`|8ksBt6Xraa	He doesn't want to talk to you.|`|SGjhNidDaa	thats bad news, he might have broken it off in that way that guys do it where they avoid you and expect you to know that you're over. :/|`|nkaY8Fg1aa	girl have some self-respect. wait till tomorrow or whatever. if he doesn't call you then he must be avoiding you. screw him|`|hvwp2bcVaa	oh man..you are gonna get dumped...wow...stop stalking him and let him call you..sheesh|`|M6PsYn56aa	Damn girl! id be soo shitting myself<br>  i say your underacting lol<br>  keep us infomed on what happens<br>  hope its all alright|`|a77nWPXPaa	wayy overreacting. if he's cheating than hes cheating.. you can't change it. you'll soon find out, but if he isn't doing anything you come off totally psycho|`|WBTCZ6rDaa	Get a grip girl, he's avoiding you, don't make a fool of yourself by chasing him.  Get over him and enjoy being with your mates.|`|pyjOGiCOaa	You are WAY over reacting ... WAY WAY over reacting specially if his family won't tell you where he is.  TAKE A HINT ... GET A CLUE.|`|6d5WuMrRaa	OVER REACTING!!!!!!!!!! dont be worried he will come around eventually
Zjjl7hrOaa	uh yes you call it black, all black people come in diff shades just like all white people come in diff shades and they ar still considered to be white|`|e59bc254d8339c1ae45e999a109e63e4aa	you can call her caramel. the OFFICIAL word would be "Brown-skin"<br>  <br>  but at the end of the day, she's still considered "black"
u2rDNTPEaa	I may not be a guy, but most of my friends are and they are always coming to me for help with their girl problems because I apparently can think like a dude so in my opinion....    It definitely sounds like he likes you! he probably flirts with girls in front of you to get you a little jealous and show that other people are into him. The fact he puts his arm around you "by accident" doesnt seem like an accident at all but an excuse to touch you. Guys tend to not talk about how they feel up front so when he said he lost interest, he was probably just trying hide that stuff. maybe he's scared. big give away is that his friends are asking if you like him. He's clearly been talking about you and wants to see if you're interested before he makes the big move. Good luck with that!!|`|zAAeLFLuaa	i think he likes you hes trying to deny it because he doesnt know if you do|`|MEr99qKraa	he did for 2 months ..errr hello it's sooooooooooooo over ..how old r u?|`|JxpbxteHaa	a friend  but maybe keep an eye on him and see   it could grow into something more...  just flirt and smile and fool around and  he will be urs|`|JKZUdhCPaa	Aww you guys sound so cute. I think you're really good friends but he probably likes you too. He sounds like he cares about you...but you have to think about what it would be like if you went out with him because if anything were to happen with you guys then do you think you'd be able to go back to the way you were?|`|nA97uWdyaa	Men are attracted to gorgeous women. There's nothing we can do about that, so if what he said is true then he does like you.
1Byis7Flaa	Contact a lawyer and ask for an Emergency Temporary Child Custody Order  Go by pick your son up, and BAM! have that Emergency Temporary Child Custody Order, followed by divorce proceedings.    Making sure you ask for the wife to have supervised visitations, along with mediation, because you heard she is on drugs.    And apologize to your daughter, and share with her the importance of honest communication.    The dude is not your friend, stop communciating with him.  And your wife is lying about the situation.

bELCxTXfaa	Really I've been in your position a couple of times, and I know one thing for sure, if you don't feel comfortable around someone, if he/she is getting on your nerves, you don't have extend your hand for friendship. Its my experience that these kind of relationships are very disturbing in future. They can have a negative effect on your social life, family life, and at times disturb your daily routine. That person might need a friend, but its not necessarily you. Just ignore, don't talk back and let it be like that for some time. These things happen in life, but you must choose your friends wisely, after all, no one should force you to be his/her friend. Its your choice and yours alone. Hope I helped.|`|6jKJCuqgaa	u cant  or   ignore him/her|`|DghSYWkFaa	Your not even willing to spend some time around this person?

I think you're being a snob personally, and I'm kind of curious as to why she wants to be your friend or join "your group."  What's the harm in making a new friend or allowing her to be in "your group?"   She might offer a different perspective, a new light, a unique voice, a fresh outlook, that will enlighten "your group" and be worthwhile.

And the people we love.<br>  You seem like a pretty sweet big sister to even be concerned and ask this. Maybe she is having at hard time a school. <br>  My daughters are 5years apart and even though they are 5 and ten they love each other but they have their days.<br>  One day you will be best friends. Bless you|`|DbrQ2jzvaa	there is nothing to do about that except just do it to her back even though u r a good person just act like she acts to u give her a taste of her own med and she will eventually stop|`|ChmuSKpVaa	spoiled brat, i am sorry you have to live with this.

yOsEeTUnaa	On my 16th birthday, I just had a luau in my backyard! It was fun!|`|uOd6MRwbaa	Step 1 buy a bag of oreo brand cookies  Step 2 Remove 2 oreo brand cookie sandwiches from the package  Step 3 Unsandwich the sandwiches...this will result in 2 cookie wafers from each sandwich and the creamy middle layer  Step 4 reflect on the 6 pieces of tasty goodness in front of you  Step 5 realize that all 6 parts came from the original 2 sandwiches  Step 6 consume the first cookies creamy middle which represents your exit of childhood then slap youself to make the exit bittersweet   Step 7 Eat 2 wafers...1 from each of the sandwiches  Step 8 Realize that you initially ate 1 of 2 creamy fillings and 2 of 4 crunchy cookie portions or 1/2 of all the treats.  (1x2x2x4=16) and this is now in the past  Step 9 reconstruct the other 2 wafers and milky middle into a single cookie sandwich made anew.  This is the future have a good look at its fractured, inviting, contrasting, sweet appearance...its yours for the taking!  Will it be savored or will it be gobbled up in one bite?    Step 10 Give the folks some oreos too...they have put up with you for sixteen hard years and deserve some sweetness and respect.  They are the parents of a sixteen year old they should be strict and protective...its their job.
xGshAiXOaa	Never having been in this situation, it's hard to say, but I would try to stay out of it as much as possible.  If I absolutely had to take sides, I would side with my actual parent.  Just know that once they are divorced, your stepmother has no custodial rights to you or your sister (unless she adopted you), it would be up to your dad whether or not you could visit with her.|`|7ewzmiNEaa	Don't take sides. Be a daughter to both.  If they try to drag you into it or influence you, just tell them you are not part of the divorce proceedings.  Tell them it is between them and to go work it out.  You are not a pawn or a tool.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	I agree with not taking sides.  It really sucks that you have to deal with this junk.  If they try to pull you in, say you are going to remain neutral.  Be there for your sibling as much as you can.  You can comfort each other.|`|vwvYhWrLaa	You and your little sister are not the reason for them separating, and they should not pull the two of you into this.  Sit both of them down and talk to them calmly; tell them that you're sorry this is happening to the 2 of them, that you love them both but you don't like being pulled into the middle.  Tell them that you want to go on loving both of them, not feeling upset with both of them or having to choose sides.  Just assure them that they both win your love equally.
H0aBhTSYaa	Not sure what your question is but I'm assuming you don't know what color flowers to pair with truffle (bridesmaid dresses?) and a cream wedding gown.  If that's the case, pink roses would be beautiful next to brown and ivory.  They are very simple and very beautiful and compliment your colors perfectly.  Any florist will be able to give you pricing on pink rose bouquets.|`|8g51eBf1aa	You can use ivory flowers and brown roses like these;    http://www.flourishdesigns.com/blog/uplo...    That would be pretty. Just ask your florist to dye them that way.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Why not accent with a pink or magenta for a pop of color? Plent of flowers come in those colros that time of year. Or, use cream colored flowers for a more monochrome look.     Good luck!|`|HLBdtP1Uaa	Do you want your flowers to be brown and cream? You can find off-white flowers but not too many in brown that look nice. I would do all cream and white flowers with greenery accents and brown satin ribbon to tie it all together.    Here are some inspiration boards I found.  This one has your colours:  http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3266/2781...  If you wanted to add an accent colour in your flowers you could do one of there:  GREEN http://www.ashaadkins.com/blog/wp-conten...  GOLD http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3093/2926...    I would also talk to a local florist and have her to a mock up of the colours you want.  Good Luck!|`|s6stLtvLaa	Talk with the florists.  They can usually find flowers you are looking for.  Another thing to consider is throwing in a third accent color like deep purple (it will go nicely with the brown).  Look for off white flowers.  Try going with seasonal flowers as well.|`|E7LQp6VRaa	EBAY!  That is where we found our flowers for the wedding.. and they are beautiful and in our colours...  and they aren't expensive...|`|sGP6s7uraa	What kind of flower do you like or what type are you looking for?  Flowers nowadays come in an array of colors.  Check with a local florist and just have a consultation with them.  You may get an idea out of what they throw at you :)|`|DqetlSB6aa	Ebay Ebay Ebay-    but don't call it truffle- say brown when you do a search. you'll come up with alot more hits    and also put in ivory when searching for cream as well as cream...
L6iYVKAWaa	Ok, well i'd defiantly have to say it's still not a good idea to be messing around with this guy. In my personal opinion, wait for him to talk to her see how thing's are headed. Because if he feel's that way about her why would he still want to be with her. They should call it quits, maybe give him some hint's.     good luck,   brooke|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	If I were you I'd stop the physical stuff immediately. Ask him to break up with her or you and him are going to just be friends. Don't let him play you, by telling you that he's not happy with her but not willing to break it off either.    Give it to him straight. Break up with her or you're just friends.|`|6717z0vkaa	messing around while he has a girlfriend is not a good idea, and he cheated on her so you would have to risk his trust if you do like him. dont just keep things as they are behind her back. you should tell him, im not just gonna be someone you cheat on. see how things go with him and his girlfriend.    if he likes you enough he will let her go, unless hes just trying to get *** because his girlfriend wont give it to him [it happens]    = ]  good luck
YtT9uGOSaa	Your girlfriend is selfish and she knows it. She tries to spin the table on you and act as if her actions are simply a reaction to something you have done. They are not. Stop letting her walk on you. How dare her compare you to her exes in any way. I would have stopped her mid sentence and told her if her ex treated her so perfectly then she knows where she can go sleep tonight. When she says she doesn't have to prove her love to you just remember that you can take that same road and stop proving yourself to her as well. This relationship sounds like it's coming to an end so just try and focus more on breaking up than mending things because the threads will unravel again.
AX4ffdNbaa	I can look at my BF and tell when is it lying, he can't look at me when he's lying he starts to laugh. If he can't look you in the eye somethings up. some men change subject, phone bills don't lie. that's how my sister in law busted her husband. does he spend a lot of time on line, try to hide the screen from you? check his car, they may have 2nd cell phone ( pick up and go) any change in habits, new friends at work. If you don't live together, has he started asking you to "call" before you come over? been their done that. That funny feeling most of us get when we think somethings wrong, it's usually right, follow it.|`|156d702b8908052bd0660d07c6803996aa	Sometimes it's really hard to tell. I had it happen and never knew for 4 months. Now that I look back though he was a little more distant. Also less sex and asking me to change the way I looked or dressed.
AA12289981	What???? She's not interested in sleeping with you, but you know she's having money problems, so that's your solution? How about helping her with her money issues without the strings, and perhaps she'll start to like you because you are a kind individual.  Do you want to date her?  Is that a possibility?  Handing her money for sex MAKES her a prostitute whether or not she was one to begin with.|`|7tAH3GEBaa	you know if she were to say yes you might reconsider God only knows what kind of woman would say yes|`|hvZb0r3zaa	No, but thought about it before. But it is illegal unless ur in nevada. So be careful.|`|f09c6b91e8ff5208f734aae055fa9100aa	taking money for sex=prostitute|`|75WCghuTaa	If you even hint at it, the best you can expect is a slap in the face|`|iXz80uW9aa	Dude ... your a total DEUTSCHE. She needs money so your going to make her lower her standards for your sexual gain. Imagine if you had a daughter and some guy did that to her ? If you have money laying around that you can just throw away to get your dick wet, maybe you should help her out to be nice. Maybe she will see you in a different light. Oh, and there is a difference between prostitutes and what your doing here. Most prostitutes enjoy their work and are not forced into it thru financial obligations.
5oUyPxuuaa	it could be a wrong number but it could also be serious. talk to a parent and the police. Once the police have the number they can figure out who it is.|`|DtIcDLTcaa	if you are at school - go talk to an administrator.  if you at home - talk to your parents.  if no one is around - call the police.  you cannot tell anything about the caller from the area code.  it could be someone who just moved to your area or is visiting.  hopefully the person just dialled the wrong number.|`|q7I1Ek3kaa	The likeliness (spelling of that ..idk?) ...the likeliness of that text being serious is very very very very very low. However what any authority figure or person like that would tell you normally is to tell the police ..and they would trace that number and then get down to business...anyone who would send that type of threat through a text musttttttttt be an idiot tho because you cant send a text through a blocked number right? I'm not so sure but..this person sent u a text with their number i'm guessing so--what a huge mistake---iFFF they were serious.    It's totally up to you...I once had a threat like that through aim on the internet..some random stranger threatened to kill my brother on the internet..i was scared and only in the fifth grade...I didn't want to take the chance so I told my mom and we called the police..they ended up shutting down school for the day and everything it turned hugeeeeeeeee! Turns out...it was just some stupiddddddd teenage boy--complete stranger who didn't even know my brother-- who found my screename because my sn wasn't private or something ..which it now is! and i have a new one now! but point is....It never turned into anything serious, thank god!    It may be a good idea to just go to the police dept and give them that cell number and tell them that you were harrassed/threatened via text..and then at least u will know u won't be getting another horrible type of text like this.
qFJOfxsiaa	Don't give up yet - suicide should never be an option.    no matter what you think, people do care for you. your family love you, and your best friend thing shouldn't be taken to heart. just because you do not think you are intelligent does not mean you cant be good at other things like art, sport, music or something. you are only young and have so many years ahead of you - don't let low self-esteem get in the way. things will turn around. see a counsellor, or talk to one of your friends. you just need 2 speak up and soon your voice will be heard. talk to your parents if you feel there are things u need 2 discuss with them. and most important of all - you need 2 be there for your baby niece. don't make her have 2 grow up without you. i bet you'll be the best aunt in the world, and you don't want 2 miss her grow up, or miss having kids of your own, do you?    if you have any concerns, or if you just need a friend. email me: ogradyna@yahoo.com. i'll always be ready to talk to those who need me.|`|NQwljNOoaa	You could benefit from professional help.  It sounds like you have a huge problem accepting yourself and being comfortable with who you are.  You sound like a good person to me, but I think you need to talk to a councilor so that you can get ideas on how to deal with your feelings about yourself and life in general.  You may not be a genius, but you are definitely not dumb.  I don't believe there are very many true genius people in this world so average intelligence is a great thing.  I consider myself average intelligence but with above average reasoning skills and I think since you are smart enough to know you have a problem and ask for help, then you are smart enough.  So my advice is to seek out counseling so that you can feel better about yourself, and it has nothing to do with intelligence.  You should never be ashamed of getting help when you need it.  That alone makes you very smart. Good Luck!|`|hYqRhQxPaa	hey don't think like this.i can understand your problem.4 days back i was feeling the same but thanx to yahoo users.they helped me a lot.  plzzzzzzzz(plz ignore my grammer.i am trying to learn english)   mail me.i'll share my problem with you.  baby don't be a looser.fight for you life.  i'll prayer for you|`|9t1taTCtaa	Hey I don't like your attitude,... You find out who are your real friends in time like this.. If their not there for you now you are better of without them... With friends like that you don't need enemies.... You should go to a mental doctor, I'm not saying your crazy, it is not only for crazy people, but maybe they can help you with the things you are seeign and hearing.... Think of all your good qualities, everybody has them, sometimes they just can't see them, cheer up.... Things will get better, if you need anyone to talk to you can e-mail me.... I offer you my friendship..... Good Luck|`|ea4zSWzGaa	Everybody feels like that at some point in there lives, I've actually felt worse myself. Keep going it cant get any worse so can only get better.|`|0psCy0XXaa	Looks like its all happening at once for you, i feel for your prediciment.  If you genuinly feel like ending it all it is your brain telling you to talk to somebody about it,  I would suggest that you arrange to see your doctor and tell him or her everything that is troubling you and they will most likely refer you to a counseller who will help you feel better about your life,  I assume you are a teenager, i was one once myself and i felt depressed a lot of the time having to contend with family probs bullies and a less then average brain but you do come out of it sooner or later,  how soon depends on how well you cope so i think you should get some help.  And rest assured doctors cannot spread your secrets cos if they do they get struck off.  Please take heed of my advice and don't ever think suicide is the best option all it will do is break your families and friends hearts and you have the rest of your life to live so start thinking positivly and life will soon go your way.    Take care of you!|`|bQ2RWRGNaa	aaaawww. im sure ur a pretty and intelligent woman. you just need to be confident in urself. dont say stuff like that about urself !!! EVA!!

But trust me... you WILL find someone who appreciates you for exactly who you are.|`|AA11599488	There is a clinic in Switzerland called dignitas that will help you with that if it's what you are after...

I dont really have any advice on what you should do im afraid. but life IS good.|`|AA11025744	If you are thinking about suicide then in my experience (limited) it does a great deal of harm to those people around you that lasts for the rest of their lives.  I don't think you want to put other people through that kind of thing so I would say it is better to try and find someone else to talk to.  Someone neutral.  I like your idea of starting here with your question but I think it is difficult to talk properly here.  Try to find someone face to face.  Good Luck.  I'm on your side.|`|0AJRl2K9aa	Poor you, you seem to be dealing with a lot of things all at once and its getting you down.  Nothing in this world is worth taking your own life for.  Start by speaking to your friend; find out exactly what was said, if anything, and be up front and tell her the truth about your feelings.  If she isn't interested it doesn't mean your life should fall apart!  We all fancy someone who doesn't fancy us at some stage!  As for your family, as busy as they all are and as much as you think they aren't interested in you, they would be horrified to learn that you feel like this.  Try and talk to your brother or sister; they WILL listen, you're their sister after all.  If you feel uncomfortable talking to them then I suggest you try this link (for a free counsellor in your area) http://www.counselling.ltd.uk/index133.h...  Good luck!|`|lY9k9ywIaa	stop letting negative thoughts coming to your head. fight them back by saying something positive about yourself- the fact that god has given you two eyes and functioning limbs.    write down things you like about yourself or think are positively unique. everytime you feel depressed look at the list of positive things about you.    don't stay alone, lsten to music...    who cares if u like your teacher? i like one of my teachers and the whole school new, i didn't wanna give up fighting and die..    now u know who your friend really is...    u are getting older now, its all part of growing up, fight them and when u hopefully get into college/uni your past will be unknown unless u tell evryone, be a warrior this is the start of your life, you have plenty of years to live...    once your older with a new group of friends/company you'll share this secret with them and have a laugh...    for everyone born a partner is prepared, you just have to discover it. if u kill yourself you''l never find that someone...    keep smiling hope i helped:)|`|qgpXxcuGaa	Babe, it can only get better. Life throws a hell of a lot of sh!t at you and it can sometimes be impossible to find of dealing with it, but you've just gotta cope and keep going. I think you need to talk to someone about this, preferably a counsellor - have you ever heard of connexions? They have a free counselling service called YPI. I've been going through sh!t recently and when I went to talk to one of them about stuff it made me feel alot better - talking takes a lot of weight off your shoulders. Especially as you're hearing/seeing things - even go to a doctor and they can refer you to someone.    If you decide to keep your feelings to yourself, I'd distance yourself from these friends because at the end of the day they're probably not real friends if they can't keep your secrets. Talk to your mum about how you feel as well, you might feel better once you've discussed it with her.    Chin up, it'll turn out okay eventually. Hang in there :) x
e7d8eccb6f819fb0623145f8b7f2099eaa	When we stand that way it throws you guys off.

This will catch her off balance because she is trying to set you up to slap you.  Or you can grab her hands and look into her eyes and talk a little sweet to her.  Fellas, you know what I am talking about.  Talk sexy to her, appeal to her ego by telling her that you are sorry even if you have not done anything and that you care about her.  By appealing to her sense of superiority, it will stroke her ego and her defenses will be down.  I have to say that I have been in those situations with guys and I just wished that he would talk to me in a different way instead of confronting me like I am a soldier in the military.  I know that some guys have tried these things that I am telling you and it worked.  Not because women may or may not be stuck on themselves but because women like for you guys to acknowledge their feelings and want to know that you are taking head to what is being said.|`|SzubaKbuaa	lean back and put your arm in front of your face.

According to studies carried out over 50% of your communication comes from your body language. This is what you don't say. Less then 8% of your communication comes from what you do say. In other words, your verbal communication. What does this mean to you?  It is much more important to pay careful attention to how you say things, and how you stand and how you act than it is to what you say. Well, at least initially.   You see, you could have the greatest game in the world and be able to really get any woman to like you loads, for example online, but if you used those same successful techniques in the real world and lacked obvious confidence, lacked eye contact etc, you would simply crash and burn.|`|v3JcRTpCaa	girls ??? ... i love girls you will know

otTMXJvRaa	Hi Armychicki,    Personally, I think premarital sex is a bad idea.    Why?     Because having sex without marriage is going outside of the laws of man and God that civilizations on this planet have lived by for thousands of years.    Because there's the unnecessary risk of excessive heartache (any break-up will cause heartache... virgin or not... but heartache will be less if you are still a virgin or at least celebate... that's just the way human brains are wired).    Because there's also the genuine danger of an unwanted Baby... or an STD.    Because your parents would very likely be extremely disappointed ( assume you are still living at home).    Because your "no sex" rule will eliminate most of the players, the losers, the creeps, the clods, and the selfish manipulators.     You're probably also under 18... which would make your BF a potential felon if you allow him to use your body and soul. Well, if you break up with him, at least you could have him arrested.     Guys may push for it, beg for it, and try to talk you into it... but once they get it, sex forever changes how both of you feel about each other.    After sex, girls typically expect to be loved... but then the guys typically no longer respect the girl. Sorry!    Armychicki, just take a look at a random selection of the questions from girls in this category... a significant number of problems here directly involve premaritial sex... coupled with immaturity, foolish expectations, and invalid assumptions.    Long term, what you need to do is find a special guy (your "Mr. Right) who will be honorable and be very good to you as a decent young lady. He may not be the hottest-looking guy around, but you will love him just the way he is. He should be a guy who is proud to take you home to meet his parents and his family. A guy that you would be pleased to take home to be introduced to your parents and family. A guy who will ask for your hand in marriage. A guy who is willing to stand together with you in a wedding ceremony before both of your families in church. A decent guy who would NOT ask you to do anything inappropriate.    You don't want to hook up with a guy who is not honorable and just wants your body... for a while... and then he would be gone. Even if he's your BF and you "love" him... if you're young, then it's extremely unlikely that you and your BF will get married.    In closing, perhaps looking at your situation from a completely different perspective would help.    Let's assume that you have a sweet younger sister, and you've always been close and you love her dearly. Now assume that you happen to see that she has posted your exact question here instead of you.    What advice would you give to your sister?    Best Wishes,  - Charlie    P.S. - If you decide to let your BF that you happen to be in love with service himself using your body, at least ask him a few questions first to clear the air: If you get pregnant, will your guy deny that he's the Dad? Marry you? Run away from you? Ignore you? Offer to pay child support for the next 18 years? Or advise you to kill the Baby?     So... which option would you prefer, Armychicki?|`|OcCgUsmLaa	Absolutely. You test drive a car before you buy right? Just don't waste your life waiting and then find out he's no good. Go for it. In fact, you need to have something to compare him with, so find a few others as well.    S|`|0udjgaoBaa	Hell yeah you have to drive the car before you buy it!|`|4drQ38qZaa	Don't. You never know if you are going to part so you might give your virginity to a jerk.|`|wVXXPRmZaa	Its your life, therefore its your choice.  I personally don't recommend it, just for the fact that I myself had sex before marriage and deeply regretted it. Im still with that same guy. Its been 5 years...I love him to death. But having sex with him completely changed my whole relationship and cause alot of trouble.    If you think you are ready, then go ahead and be safe!  But if you have doubts, I would suggest you wait.    Good Luck!|`|tquwmxqUaa	If you love the person and you are both sure its what you want, then i don't see anything wrong with it. How does a piece of paper saying your married make any difference to that, because even when people get married theres no saying that they're gonna stay married. :D|`|hvZb0r3zaa	No one waits anymore until marriage but most girls regret losing their virginity to the wrong guy so your call. Depends on how long u have been going out too. If the guy is willing to wait then wait a while.|`|3uls2NlXaa	life is too short, why not?  if the moments right and your comfortable then go for it :)|`|a35c4a3ab714036bfd3c31e133920f9caa	of course it is...  don't worry about it...|`|FzFSzilmaa	sex before marriage is ESSENTIAL... you wouldn't buy a car without first test driving it..|`|hFQa24wOaa	No. Please do not do this. Why must kids feel pressured to have sex before marriage|`|PxVDtnSzaa	It doesn't make any sense to me when people say you have to "test drive the car".   One, a man is not a car. You're in a relationship! It's not comparable to a peice of machinery.  Two, if you have never "driven the car", you won't have anything to compare it with. If neither of you have experienced sex, you won't have to worry if you're doing it right, or how "good" he is.  I'm a virgin, and I'm 22. I've been in my relationship for 4 years, and I've committed to myself and to him that we're not going to spoil our wedding night.  Its something to look forward to!|`|rHf5DkZHaa	it depends on you. are you ok with having sex before marriage? does love~>sex for u?    since your asking if its ok.. i'm guessing your not really ok with it.  being in love with your b/f doesn't justify having sex.|`|3kCmqrnzaa	Well actually it is a sin to have sex before marriage & I would never do it before marriage  But that's my personal choice & if you think your ready then do it only if you like  But remeber that's not the best idea exspecially if you young because you have such a high risk at getting pregnant even if you are on birth control it doesn't always work|`|jK2lvFWGaa	Well if you are asking you probably aren't ready. but yes i think it is fine why get married to someone and then turn out to be completely incompatible sexually|`|oqlc69gmaa	I struggle with this too. My bf is the only guy I have ever gone all the way with but I am pretty sure we are going to get married soon.  I hope I didn't make a big mistake but I think so long as we get married it is ok.|`|cnlbQkyIaa	To most people it is. But I'm religious and I really believe that God wants me to wait.    Not only that, but I respect myself too much to let someone take advantage of me. Not having sex has so many perks: you can't get pregnant, you can't get STD's, you cannot get AIDS, and you know that your man loves you for you and not how you do in bed.    Besides, my virginity is something that I can only give one man in my whole life. Of course I'd like to give that gift to my husband once I marry him :)|`|218995b9fdcabd574c75e721c8cfe9f9aa	that depends on your morals and if it feels rite to you.  you may think your in love with him but it could juss be hormones than one day you guys get into a big fight and break up, but then you gotta live with "i gave my virginity to this guy" if you get my jist?    i would personally wait a few more years im not syaing till marriage but at least untill you kno that ur deffinately going to get married to this guy and everything is rite|`|bzNzmGADaa	I think if your really in love with the person then it  is okay to have sex before you are married. You   just have to ask yourself if that person is worth it (:|`|XXE5uveJaa	yes|`|eLip8nonaa	Why asking if you are ready to do it do it. on the bible it says not to have sex before marriage, but if you are ready and you want to do it why not?|`|j4Mjc4Ecaa	depends on many things, such as your values, morals, and how close the two of you are.  Then you have to take into account stds as well as unplanned pregnancies.  You seem young, so I would wait a bit adn get to know your partner better before you make such a huge commitment...hope this helps :]|`|26KPiekKaa	You shouldn't. This is considered a sin.|`|fz22nzHeaa	i don't know how old you are so....    if you are a teen then wait.  if you are 30, go for it.|`|9qmcF0O0aa	i agree with bella you will get sent to hell if you do. but ya it your choice. just dont let the presure get you.|`|5x0VKnQEaa	If you want to feel excited for the first night on your marriage,dont  It would be like. .. im gonna lose my virginity on my wedding night!!  its so cool,it'll be such a special day  dont lose ur virginity on any other day
9TWdWoTwaa	Oral sex............|`|Ikd9cppcaa	It means oral sex. Oral sex on a guy by a girl.|`|FklngtvCaa	It's oral sex.  Well, really when a girl is giving head to a guy.  It's like slang for 'felatio'.    When a girl sucks a guy's penis.  Look it up on http://www.urbandictionary.com|`|bYjercAqaa	oral sex...mouth on genitals|`|hPBnjOeDaa	a *******:)|`|cJcwHBglaa	********! :D|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Having oral sex.

All is nasty to me but most people say it feels good. I would know cause I have never done it and it haven't been done to me, but I'll try it:)|`|vL0TQTYOaa	talk to your parents|`|3kCmqrnzaa	Well people in my school say it all the time  It means to suck someones penis  Just like a ********|`|i5c6wJoYaa	It means to give oral sex to man, or more correctly put, it's called fellatio... You should really talk with your parents about this, though.
6ABvgu4iaa	your parents i wll forgive you they love you, but there are 1000000s of girls out there that do more than just kiss a guy (not saying that you did) let them know that you resprct them\ and yourself far to much to go anyfurther with a guy without being mature and telling them about it. They'll come around hope that everything works out for you.|`|k4jQKuz7aa	smack that ho and tell her to respect your authority|`|XmEjhMvRaa	Maybe your parents are just concerned..!! Try to talk to your parents and try to regain their trust. Do something or try to impress them to get their trust back..!!|`|c32MJwDJaa	My mom is always comparing me to my sister.  She thinks i will end up like her.   pregnant at 18  tattoos at 16  sex at 13  but im over the age of 13   and havent had sex  no tattoos(piercings though)  and since i have not had sex i  cant be prego  but if you tlk to ur mom like i did  she will eventually stop comparing you to ur sis  and she will see you as you and not as your sister  just tlk to her and tell her how you feel.|`|VoumuST5aa	cody your stupid  kill yourself? pfffffft!  try the best you can to make them trust you   you seem like a good girl   the only thing you can do is try =)  you'll forgive you again|`|RZ72YJGCaa	Omg.    I have the same problem.My parents don;t want me to date because they think I am going to have sex and end up working in McDonalds. Like your parents my parents too,mostly my dad, compares me to my older sister because she left with her boyfriend at 17 [almost 18].So, I have a boyfriend [we don't really kiss either] and my sister threatens to  tell them and if that were to happen they would never trust me again.  But I think you should explain to your parents that nothing happened and that it was just innocent and that they should trust you enough to know that you would do the right thing.    Hope this helps.    :)
NUWdgQuraa	He's only kissing the woman he loves.  Maybe it's his wife, or maybe he has  3 to go to now.

Qn4Pmdt8aa	Ok, first of all, try to get you're mother into therephy. Do not think about suicide!!!!! You're right, there so much to live for. Talk to your dad, ask him for some help. He needs to talk to you're mother. Right now. It won't be easy, but you can and have to do it.   Speak up to her.  Hopes this helps.
9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Can you go live with your dad? You might need to have a face to face talk to your dad or another love one that can help you out. Your mother is trying to  make herself hate your dad, so the doesn't love him anymore, and the divorce will be easier on her (doesn't work)... She needs to realize that your just a child, and need to be a child, and NOT hear all the negative. One parent shouldn't put another parent down to the child or in front of the child. Your mom is miserable and trying to make others that way too... If I were you I would really get with another adult that cares about you, and can  help you figure out what to do in this situation. If you don't have anyone, maybe a Teacher, Principal, school counselor? If not and your really feeling desperate, call Child Protective Service for yourself... At least then people will take your serious, and maybe fix or change the situation.. Sorry hun your going threw this...     Please do not attempt Suicide.. here is a phone number to  USA National Suicide Hotlines  1-800-784-2433 (suicide)  1-800-273-8255 (talk)  1-877-968-8454 (youth America Hotline)

Place in a bowl all 6 folded papers and draw from it. Take turns.

AA11294818	Exes are exes for a reason, my husband and I started dating when he and his ex talked regularly. I was NEVER comfortable with their friendship because I could clearly see she was not over him. I sat down with him one night and told him how I felt, and asked how he'd feel if I was doing the same thing (friendship with a specific ex). He totally understood where I was coming from and severed ties! That's when I knew he was serious about not losing me. So if your bf doesn't cut it out, I wouldn't take him to be too serious about the relationship, and then you can make your decision from there.<br>  <br>  I don't blame you for not trusting him with this, because it's just not mature and proper, really. Why are most guys friends with girls when they're all young? If you ask them, most of them secretly hope there may be something that happens between them! Seriously! My best friend asked all our guy friends that when I was 24 years old. It still hasn't changed.|`|zaLBWWjnaa	Sounds fishy to me to be honest.

I have gone through the same thing so don't think you are alone.<br>  My ex stopped speaking to me when I told him I was pregnant (I am due today) and for the last 6 months, it has been hell for me and I have been so worried I am damaging my baby with my stress.<br>  It's hard to think about facing something as big as raising the baby alone isn't it?<br>  I also was making myself ill thinking about him with the tart he went off and cheated with as soon as I told him I was pregnant and it wasn't doing me or the baby any good. I just sobbed every night, had anxiety attacks and was hyperventilating through the night, then beign sick etc. <br>  NOT a nice feeling!  You need to get to the conclusion that he is a jerk all by yourself. With me, it didn't matter how many times everyone else told me, I had to get there all by myself and I did in the end.He is a coward and a liar and my baby and I deserve more - you will get there too, believe me. <br>  You need to take control back as at the moment he is in control. Are you still contacting him a lot? If you are he (like my ex) just thinks he is the biggest stud on the planet and everyone is fighting over him. Don't giev him the satisfaction even if it hurts under the surface. I made a decision to not allow him to see my grief and by doing so, and making him feel uncomfortable in his surroundings (our local pub mainly that I make a point of going into lots now), I have taken control back as he now thinks I don't care at all and he hates that. It has also helped me get stronger with what I have to face alone now (any day in my case!), and has helped me get over him a bit.<br>  I am also planning to get some serious revenge on him for what he has done to me through these last few months that has also endangered his child, but revenge is a dish best served cold, so I am going to let him think I have forgotten about it and then swoop! <br>  Good luck, and keep that baby safe x|`|6GVV71auaa	first tell him he has to be in the baby's life and do not lose touch or the baby is going to be devastated not to have a biological father so to get over him you have to look hotter and more attracted once you have the baby go to the beach have fun hang out with your friends. like I said AFTER you have the baby go on dates make sure the guy is caring probaly divorced too and make sure he is fun and probaly has little kids.|`|tG1vTi0Daa	First off hes an azz for leaving you, unless you wanted him out, that wasnt smart.

89UOqaVNaa	Marriage is a lifetime commitment through good times and bad. Don't take that lightly.<br>  <br>  Boredom happens in even the happiest marriages from time to time. Life's demands take their toll, and the routine starts to numb both spouses.<br>  <br>  If you want things to get better, don't let that happen. Find out what your husband likes and do whatever it takes to please him. He will naturally start to pick up more interest in you and start thinking of ways to please you, and hopefully you'll be back on track.<br>  <br>  Watch the movie "Fireproof" together.<br>  <br>  There is hope for hopeless marriages.<br>  <br>  Love is putting the needs of others before your own. Love your husband, and love your children. Children benefit from having parents who love each other.<br>  <br>  Find ways to make marriage more exciting. Work on what you have and it will flourish. The grass may be greener on the other side, but it's not your grass, so you may as well take care of your lawn, fertilize, water, etc. so your own lawn will be lush. Envying over the other lawn will not help your marriage in any way, but is detrimental.|`|2sF0qPjBaa	I think that tends to happen when you have been married for awhile.

As living with a parent at this stage can offer stability. I am assuming your parents work so either would be fine to financially support you. Your sister may feel happy but at the same time it might not be fair for her to be supporting you when she has to be forwarding her own life.<br>  <br>  In my case I hate living at home full stop, no arguments. its how I feel. but until I'm fully through with education and in a stable financial position to support myself I'm going to take the free ride (sure I work and contribute to the house but its not as much as what it would be if I were supporting myself).<br>  <br>  So there's an option. Pick one of your parents who is happy to support you financially. At 16 you are an adult but have the choice as a teenager to get some freebies like this in life so that you can concentrate on working towards your goals whether its in education or working your way up towards a career.<br>  <br>  What ever you do though, think it through thoroughly and consult the people involved to get their opinions and views (i.e. from your sister and parents). it may not seem a good enough time or right to say but you have to otherwise you'll be left out and not really get anywhere.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your decision, hope it all works out.

bO2rzfISaa	Why are you letting her bother you? She's obviously paranoid, in other words, not just greedy and demanding but mentally ill. Turn off the phone.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	keep all proof that she called and texted you. start writing everything down, the dates and times she calls, and from what number she calls and text you from. then contact your police department and press harassment charges on her.|`|cUfOnldzaa	If she's that bad, get a restraining order.|`|U5IigAByaa	i'd suggest speaking to your local charity solicitor to get free advice on this.|`|AA11189953	It takes a lot to raise kids today as you well know.

Unfortunatly the baby mamma is always a part of the equation.  Have him have a talk with her to try and stop the harrassment.|`|AA10296861	Have the money drafted from your husbands bank account into hers, whatever the legally designated monthly/weekly amount is.     The state will do this, its saves lots of time for everyone.     After the amount is automatically drafted each term,( if the money is not in her account,she will have 2 take it up with her bank.) if she continues to call ( you personally) because you the (new wife )do not owe her child support, simply go to the police and file a restraining order .     Not allowing her within 100 feet of you or able to call/text or have any form of electronic or physical communication with you.    She has to be able to contact your husband but not via you.
IYF4xSTdaa	depends on which kind of loss..  if it is your true love who is alive and well..then you feel hurt,a little hate,some pain every time you see them with someone else,but happy that they are alive and doing well,and living again..    if it is death then you cry until you can't anymore,you yell at anyone who say the slightest thing against that person,in your mind..you tell yourself that the person is in a better place,and god knows what is best..  but for both of these you mourn the same way,you take the time and effort to look for the good times and hold on to it,with both you need time to get over and move on,and in given time the memories is what keeps you going,and then you are able to celebrate,that love and in doing so you are moving on..|`|RF2YV9ataa	By moving on with your life for starters|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	u can honor it for what it was, when things were good, but when it ends, u have to let it go, and not look back into the past, and not think of what it could have been.|`|9dea238f1f524043f50eeb1a088b0c6eaa	Keep the memory of that love alive by not forgetting the GOOD times, but moving on with your life just the same....|`|U5IigAByaa	i don't celebrate it, i'm still in the mourning stage

The best thing for you to do is to talk to them about it. Hang out with them even if they don't want to. Say good things about them. And give them some stuff like a kind of food they like.
26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	You need to ask the caterer how they figure it. Whether it is per person for the entire night or per person for each hour. Every caterer is different and you need to ask them directly.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	You pay per person for a package regardless if they drink or not.  Non-alchoholic options are included in the price.  So, if you chose the Top Shelf Liquor Package, it's 18.95+$3 per person for a total of $2195+$150 for the bartender= $2345    Option 1:  $18.95x100=$1895+$150= $2045    Get the idea?  Usually the venue uses the head count that you provide for the food when figuring the bar package.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	you just pick option 1, 2 or 3 and tell the caterer your head count.  don't try to estimate who is drinking and who is not.  the caterer knows how many bartenders you need for the   of guests, and how much liquor they'll need.  let them formulate a quote and send it to you, don't try to do the numbers yourself unless you think it's high or they're ripping you off.|`|AA10378447	A full open bar is where you have a bartender providing service for your guests for a certain amount of time, or for the entire event, and your guests can order whatever they like (or, what you agree to have on hand). The tab is presented to you at the end of the event, since there is no way to know how much your guests will drink. The bar prices they're quoting are for SERVICE. Then, under the "Option" sections, those are the prices for the actual alcoholic beverages served. So, you'll pay the service charge, plus for the cost of alcohol.|`|sLLgERQWaa	If I understand it, you will be paying a set price per hour for your final head count (only the establishment can give you the final rate on that-call them!) plus and extra 3 dollars per head for Tp Shelf ...if you run over the alloted 5 hours, then it sounds like it's an additional 150.00 per hour and that would be on top of the normal hourly rate......open bars can be expensive because the establishment does NOT go by how many people you think will drink, but how many guests you have. You might consider having an open bar for only a certain amount of time, then after that, guests pay for their own.....while it is proper to pay for their drinks, you don't have to pay for them to drink themselves into oblivion on your ticket......buy what you can afford...when it runs out, it runs out...booze is not on same playing field as food and soft drinks.  ..or consider a dry wedding....nothing wrong with that.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Full Open bar means: NO GUESTS PAY FOR BOOZE!  Most caterers make you pay for all guests of drinking age.  Say grandma doesn't drink cause of meds, you still have to pay the $18.95 for her if you pick option 1, $16.95 for option 2. etc.  So let's say you go with option 1. you'll pay $1895.  Ask if they have a Tab option.  You only pay for what people drink (you obviously pay after the date).  That's what we are doing and even if EVERY person has 1 drink an hour it'll STILL be less.    EDIT: I think some other answerers are a little confused.  The $150 per hour is ONLY if you want the bar open more than 5 hours. AFTER 5 hours that charge applies.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Depends which option you choose. You would pay the per-person fee for the package you choose plus $150 for the bartender. You generally have to pay for ALL over 21s of your total headcount - unless your caterer/facility allows you to count only people you *think* will drink, in which case I don't know how they would mark those allowed and those not allowed.     Good luck!|`|Iyc5vrEcaa	It depends on what you want to serve them. It will be based on the total number of people, not only on those who are drinking.|`|TJKvoLeBaa	It just depends on the option you choose.  $1895 for  1, $1650 for number two and $1145 for number three.  Add tax and gratuity onto that and there is your total for alcohol.|`|irLnPW4aaa	At the open bar, guests can go to the bar and ask for the drinks that they would like to have.     With open bar, they charge by the number of guests in attendance, regardless of what percentage you think will drink the alcohol.    So for option number 1, 100 guests would cost $1895.  If you want top-shelf liquors, add $300.  Guests can have liquor of thier choice, wine or beer.    Option 2 would be $1650.  Guests can have beer, wine or margaritas, no other alcohol choices.     Option 3 would be $1145, more for better wines.  Guests can only request wine.    If you had the reception for less than 5 hours,  each option would be $300 less.     If somehow the bartender had to stay longer,  you'll be charge $150 extra.      Be aware that you'll need to tip the bartender.  They will often put a tip jar on the bar as well.    Also, in many reception venues, the 'open bar' will close during dinner service to encourage people to sit down and stay out of the waitresses way while they are carrying food trays around (ask ahead of time if this will happen at your venue).

77Ng0HT8aa	I would honestly just give it some time. I went through a similar situation where I fooled around/ almost had sex with a guy friend and we were both into it, and then it got weird.. like it just wasn't right and he told me he just wanted to be friends in an email. It totally broke my heart even though I knew he was right and we weren't right to be in a "relationship" together. That's why I think just not contacting him for a bit is the best option and giving him time to realize things as well. Good luck! :)|`|TwlXQhLaaa	if your really sensitive about it and **** like that but that's not cool doin that to somebody|`|o5rfI7oUaa	O my.. well save the drama 4 yo momma|`|fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	You could try, but it is usually not the same after you cross that line.|`|MEr99qKraa	to late u crossed the line y do ppl have to be told DON'T HAVE SEX WITH UR FEIENDS....u were  afraid things wud get this way yet the knickers still came off......let this be a lesson to ya..don't e-mail him i know as a man it'll p him off more..only thing i can suggest is give it time ..and u just might be freinds again ..and no more knicker dropping with him or ne of ur other freinds|`|xDlBM6N6aa	I think that'd be good.|`|ZE1h8ScXaa	Well you should just email him,move on,forget it ever happened, and ask to be friends again.|`|2c2W4zQJaa	friends with benefits is always a bad idea    having sex isn't just going to the movies with your buddy..............you shared the most intimate act two people can have with one another.  friends don't have sex with one another...........you both made a mistake.        it's too awkward right now. let things cool down for a few weeks.      if he doesn't respond after that move on        you lost a friend but learned something in the process

1117d18f8d71cf8ea1aa8a2c83b3cb4daa	umm.. all you can do is talk to her and mayb even him about it.. Although you can't force them together..

C2olZsNiaa	Hey, I'm not saying this because it's right but...the best way to get over one man is with another man.  I am not saying it's healthy or anything like that but spending time with a hot guy that is attracted to you and you to him does something for the confidence and it distracts you.  In the long run it might now be the best but it works.  Kinda like drugs..you know they are not good for you but you do them anyway for that temporary escape from reality.|`|mdtkor2Paa	i'm sorry
BGIsuNMTaa	Right Sweetie.   You are better than this. Please don'ty let yourself be put through this. Your friend is selfish and inconsiderate and you need to think who you are. Friends always reflect who you are, so if you want to be classed as nasty and selfish then continue to hang around with her.   I had friendship problems like this when I was is my first few years in high school, my best friend left and I was left with no one. I felt like such as cling on as I had to hang around with groups here and there and felt uncomfortable. One night I just decide I was my own self and would live MY LIFE to the full and whoever wanted to be part of that could. I made loads of friends and was even voted the populest in the year.   You need to stop being a doormat and letting this girl walk across you. She can see that you come back to her even when your nasty so stand up to it, talk to other people in your year when you get the opportunity and get closer to them. Maybe try talking to the other girl, and show your so called friend what it feels like.   I hope you feel better and she is seriously not worth it. At this stage of your life you think friendships and what group your in is so important but in a few years time you wont even know her.   Good luckl|`|6lkNOFNlaa	Then why bother with her?    Show some dignity, you are better than this!    Don't let this girl treat you this way.    So what, your other friends are the rejects? The only way you are going to make friends is if you are open and honest and easy to talk to. People don't talk to you if you are quiet and have nothing to offer.    Get talking to some people and have confidence in yourself. Show this girl that you don't need her and that you are not going to let her walk all over you.    You can become great friends with the 'rejects' if you have enough time to get to know them.    Just think: in the long run, who is going to care whether they are 'rejects' or not? They will treat you better than your other friend.     Most the people at school will not stay your friend in later life, I guarentee so don't waste your time and energy getting so upset about them.    There is nothing wrong with independence either. You don't have to depend on friends to get you through school life. In a couple of years you'll be finished school and you never have to think about anyone in your school again.|`|TvMiwKjEaa	Why would you want to be friends with her if she acts like that?|`|908247ae24ebe20f4112fecc67b8d4a9aa	you don't say how old you are but when i was young i didn't have many friends and no best friend but your best friend will probably come back to you again when she finds out the new friends aren't  what she thought. i made a best friend at college and we are still best friends after 28 years there the ones that will count|`|iLXGSfDpaa	OK!!! Try and ask your friend what made her think friendship between you two 2 is babyish. Tell her how you feel when you're being left out and feel lonely.
uBssj3Znaa	I caught the bouquet and then immediately dropped it like it never happened. This happened about two years ago and I am still not married, but no one else who attended the wedding has been married either.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	it's an idiotic tradition that should be banned.  I was almost fatally hip checked by a crazed maid of honor 6 or 7 years ago who was dying for the bouquet, and I've never taken part in that part of the reception since.  of course she's married now and I'm not, but that's besides the point.  women get crazy over the bouquet and it means nothing.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	It is an old wives tale.

yNbGq4viaa	In my opinion, if you are in a band or working on a solo career in which you show great promise and you are able to provide for yourself and be financially independant then by all means you should continue to pursue your music.  If, on the other hand, this is a dream you have and you are not making a living by doing it I would take the class your girlfriend recommended so that you can earn a good income while you work on your goal of becoming a musician and producer.  There's an old saying that goes "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."      I caution you not to let anyone force you into anything because this will lead to resentment down the road.  Maybe you can work a regular job and pursue your music at night or on the weekends.  There are night classes and other ways of doing both things at once.  In this economic climate, you may have to postpone what you really want to do in order to provide for yourself and any future family you may have.  With less people spending money on entertainment and less people eating out and going to concerts, etc. now would be a good time to make sure you have a fall back plan.  Good luck with whatever you decide.|`|AA12130542	Having something to fall back on is a good idea, but not at the expense of your chosen path. If she loves you, she should support your dreams, as long as they arent completely unrealistic (like colonizing the mooon or something). there does come a point in life where you have to realize that if it hasnt happened yet, it unlikely to happen, but you are nowhere near there yet. and you do need an income. you could try pursuing both, but personally, id take the music production course and tell her she can take the electrical engineering classes.|`|77Ng0HT8aa	Follow your dreams. if you don't, you'll always wonder what if and it will haunt you. If she loves you then she'll wait for you.
NvW6voPJaa	Hi and congratulations!    Both places (the outdoors venue) and the indoor room are lovely!  I really wouldn't worry about the chandeliers.  Maybe with it being in the summer, you won't need to have all of them on (if that is possible).  But in any case, I don't really think any centerpiece would clash with them.  It's lighting...that's it.  Really, I wouldn't have even noticed them had you not pointed them out.    Obviously, it's up to you, but personally, I don't like the tall centerpieces.  I DO think that might contrast because when you have tall centerpieces it brings the eye up.....not focused down on the tables.  I would do a low vase with flowers or a combination of flowers and floating candles if you want.  Since it's going to be summer, you can get inexpensive flowers and simply float them in a bowl (no candles needed!)  Something like this:    http://k41.pbase.com/u39/mox/large/25403...  http://tgis.wetserver.net/liveimages/rec...  http://www.neighborhoodflorist.com/photo...|`|rDsKB0uXaa	good beautiful smelling flowers|`|ACecbVghaa	Classic flowers, lots of them, fresh and fragrant!|`|Dv7340P0aa	differnet venue.  That's what i'd do.|`|HLBdtP1Uaa	The chandeliers are beautiful, I have ones like that in our venue too.    When you see the hall in a picture like that, all you see are the chandaliers but when you actually walk into the room your eye level goes to the tables. I wouldn't worry about "clashing" with the lighting.  People will be sitting at the tables and looking at the centrepeices more than the ceiling.    I am doing tall glass vases with green apples in the stem and flowers on top with tealight candles around the base.    You could do just candles, different heights:  http://www.california-wedding-ideas.com/...  http://www.nycityweddings.com/chat/p/299...  Something that would compliment the chandelier:  http://www.blossomsweddingflowers.com/P9...    Hope that helps!|`|NB5L3rpQaa	if you could attatch some sheer curtains to part of that dark gazebo,it would help, also maybe a couple of tall, candle holders for white pillar candles, or a tall unity candleabra, maybe wrap a flowering vine around the length of the holder, and a white carpet for walking to the gazebo.
4gZYucHMaa	My spouse and I certainly have had our fair share of obstacles as well, and we've been told the same thing--walk away, etc. Especially after the death of my son, we were challenged bc we went different ways, it's taken a long time to get to where we are now and it's step by step but at the end of the day, we both know where we want to be.    It's my opinion people have this conception that as soon as the ring goes on, everything you hated prior to marriage will disappear, people wear blinders when in love and once the shine wears off, they're left dumbfounded.    I agree people choose divorce or cheating as a means to an end, instead of dealing with the real problems--that's the point of a marriage, to have each others back and support each other.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	Yes. I think divorces are made to be way too easy for most states. No fault divorces allow a couple to divorce, pretty easily, for absolutely any reason at all. If you were to take away the no fault divorces, I believe the divorce rate would dramatically decrease. Leaving only fault based divorces, where proof of the reason is needed (i.e. adultery, abuse, addiction, etc)|`|AA10876923	Yes, the idea of marriage is taken much to lightly these days.  One must feel in their head and heart they've done e/thing possible to make their marriage work.  In reality, BOTH partners must have the same love and determination for a marriage to succeed.|`|x3LclBZ0aa	i totally agree with you. my guess is that a lot of people nowadays take their vows very lightly. they expect being married to involve some work but are not very realistic about it. i know a lot of married couples that have been together a LONG time and they all have to say that it hasnt been easy and they felt like giving up many many times but stayed anyway to make it work.   i believe that marriage takes a lot of hard work and dedication and commitment and patience and youre right, if youre the type to bail out at the first few signs of distress, then you might as well not enter the sacred union...of course with the exception of some factors such as abuse, etc.  is it any surprise that divorce is at an all time high?|`|0HUHHzIQaa	I'm with spinit on that one, hahahaha...    But, I think people often assume why others got divorced... truthfully, we don't always know what's going on behind closed door. No one knew I was getting hit, shoved, pushed, held down, yelled at, cussed at, etc. and honestly, it's not something you really want to tell others around you.    What I think, is that people often assume why others get divorced without knowing the full story.    and as for your friends... they've never been in the situation so they don't know how they'd react. You can't predict how you'd react in a situation you're not in and can't be in (not married, no kids, etc).|`|8txWayVnaa	The vows also say "forsaking all others. . . ."  So, when I found out about my spouse's SECOND affair, it was over for me.  And trust me. . .I hung in there through EVERYthing else.      Do people resort to divorce too quickly?  Probably.  But life is too short to spend the rest of it in an unhappy marriage.|`|AA11481889	I think it's both...    I don't think people actually consider what marriage is when they say "I DO"...I think they see it as disposable in the first place now a days...so that when things do start going down hill...they just figure a quickie divorce will be the cure.    Quite honestly, I don't want to make this political...but I think we've gotten too far from the conservative family values and consequently, we don't take "Family" and "Marriage" as seriously as we should...and it's sad...because now it's getting to the point were young people don't even see the need to get married now at all ...using the climbing divorce rate as an excuse....and it's just wrong.    Marriage and Divorce are both two very serious life altering decisions...neither of which should be taken lightly and sadly...I don't think many people put too much thought into either now a days.|`|uetenAeRaa	i agree but then my husband cheated on left me for his girlfriend.  so he didn't tough it out with me.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	spinit is right (first poster)  People focus on the wedding and not the marriage. They get married very quickly, they don't know each other well, they get married because they are pregnant or whatever, and it all blows up.     Before getting married you should ask important questions about religion, finances, working, moving to a new state, kids, and more. I also think that people think they can change the other person and when they can't they decide to leave.     If people were required to have premarriage counseling (like driver's training) before getting a marriage license it may help reduce the divorce rate. I'm sure some people would still be blind and ignore red flags but at least they would be more prepared.|`|FyFDp5Jlaa	Depends on the reasons for marriage, If it was for love people won't divorce so easy unless there is adultery.|`|x0pTYbdnaa	No, I think they get married too easy.     EDIT-Guess I should have gone more into depth:    There is also a religious issue that causes problems, not living together or having sex before marriage. Believe it or not, those beliefs have led to divorce! In my hometown there was actually a support group of people who all had the same issue; Their religious beliefs had kept them from intimately getting to know their prospective spouses and truly loving who the spouse was.        Studies have proven that you do not truly know someone until you have known them for 3 years.    I would say that 80% of weddings occur between those who have not known eachother 3 years or more. Numerous couples get married within the first 2 years. More and more are getting married in the first year!    A psychologist would consider that marrying a stranger.      Isnt it possible that marriages go sour because the spouses were never compatible in the first place?|`|50ab85f362cbbddab47844295a4bba7caa	I agree with completely.    I think people get married now with the idea already in their head that they'll just divorce later if it doesn't work out.    Marriage is some sacred to me - good and bad.    Of course there are some circumstance that may not be tolerated, but you've got to give anything a chance.|`|ZCxeEwXZaa	People do divorce to easily. Till death do you part has no meaning anymore. If things get rough just divorce and find someone else. Things are not always going to be easy in marriage but barring cheating or abuse a couple should keep working on things until they are where they should be. I wish I wouldn't have got divorced but it wasn't my decision and even if I did things differently I don't think she would have stayed with me because she wanted to do what she wanted to do. People alot of times get divorced for selfish reasons.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Well, I think people for the most part make bad choices to begin with.  I didn't get married till I was 27, husband was 35 at the time - we were both educated and had dated around prior to meeting so we both knew what we wanted.  When we met, everything just clicked.  Now this doesn't mean we'll be married forever, certainly there is the possibility that one or both of us could change over the years and we could decide this isn't quite right...but I went into this marriage with the game plan of us being married only once and to each other for the rest of our lives.  I don't think most people can say that and really mean it.    Society is so sad - people are used to getting what they want no matter what and they frequently and easily get bored and need to upgrade their partners, as if people are the same as computers or TV's - but that's the mind set today.  And I think there are a lot of women out there who want a big ring, and a dream wedding and that's it - they don't realize the work involved after that.  They plan for the wedding not the marriage.  It's amazing and unreal to me.|`|ETHdEtPQaa	yes people get divorced way too easily. its become so common and so simple to go down to the courthouse pay the money and then your done. the only problem is that people who do that never really solve the problem they were having and will bring them into the next relationship as baggage|`|mOayTJDmaa	Both men and woman will have ups and downs.  If you always leave someone for a down time, then you will always leave anyone.  But I admire you to be supportive of him.  Sticking with him will pay off.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Perhaps your situation seems TRULY miserable to your friends. But, obviously, no one can judge it but yourself. By the same token, why would you judge others, who did get divorced? Perhaps, from their point of view, their situation WAS miserable.
nLFr9csfaa	I know women can be complicated I am one. We tell you we want this only to contradict ourselves 3 days later. I'm sure this is typical after 14 years of marriage. All couples go through phases...some good some terrible. And let me tell you (because I am a woman) sometimes we get unhappy with ourselves and we take it out on everyone else around us. As women we give so much to our familys that we lose sight of that young, sexy girl we once were. And the reason she dosen't feel intamate feelings for you is because she has lost sight of that handsome sexy young man she feel in love with. I can't tell you how to fix your relationship but I can advise you to not give up. Please keep in mind that the single life isn't what it's cracked up to be. Being single today is so different than 15 years ago. It's a crazy. cruel, dangerous world out there.|`|CYLsFjbAaa	Complicated.    If it's at all a possibility, try to stay together for the sakes of the kids.    Listen- if you fell in love once you can do it again. You married and dated and were mutually attracted for a reason. Try to see that in her again, and ask her to do the same for you.     Try to be romantic... set up candles and soft music and make her a lovely dinner while the kids are elsewhere. Make her see that spark in you that she fell in love with in the first place.     Don't harp on who's problem it is- it's YOUR problem. You're in this together. You two promised that when you said your wedding vows. Work it out. Make the other love again. And best of luck. I truly hope that everything works out for the two of you. :)|`|4lPlPlqwaa	I think u should ask urself if that is ok with You for Your marriage. Some couple can function without intimacy and explosive sex. Some cannot. I don't think there is a right or wrong except for you. Intimacy has to be alive and well outside sex and the bedroom - handholding - kissing - etc.  Have you tried couples counseling?  Have you tried an intimacy camp (for couples who lost that BAM!)  Before all that - have you tried asking her what she needs? How bout a date? If you treat her like 'your best friend' that is how she will respond to u.    Good Luck|`|4c9391cfa16bebe970881d0831749fe1aa	I'll go ahead and throw you a vote of confidence. First off, congrats on making it 14 years. You have me beat in that corner! One thing I have learned through error (and error and error and error) is that you only control what you can control. Take the lead and change what you are doing. Ask her if she is willing to work at it, give her a reason to remember how you guys were, and tell her that is what you want back. If you got married in church, take an hour and go back, reintroduce religion into your relationship. There will always be highs and lows. Every relationship has some good and some bad. Your relationship is worth working on, it will not only bring happiness again to you, but it will give you both a sense of accomplishment instead of taking the easy road out (which I have done in the past). Pick up some flowers, get a babysitter and take her to dinner. Do not tell her about it, just do it. Institute it. Make it your life. Start slow, as you do more and more over time, it will improve. Good luck, don't give up on what you have built together. God bless!|`|caajkvXxaa	first stop cursing yourself its not your fault only and it happen at least once in every ones married life. stop thinking that you are having any issues with your dear wife. try to spend as much  time you can afford with your wife. talk good things rather than discussing on whose mistake or fault it was. one thing is very sure that both of you love each other very much .....god bless you.|`|3Vo9Ldhaaa	Well, as a married woman of 19 years and three children...I can tell you that slow periods regarding a married relationship happen.     One thing that I believe she might be trying to convey is that you are not filling her in on your every day life. Meaning,  you should try a more best friend type approach, and have some fun, to show her that you still want her and that you appreciate her willingness to care for you and your children.     Avoiding any cost of divorce; it is worth your time and effort to make some time for the both of you now. This endeavor may prove more eye opening than you think. The case may be that her outlook has changed and you are not allowing her to express that; because, you have unplugged from the relationship you both created 14 years ago.    Best of Luck! I hope this helps with something so that you both may move forward together.|`|ft8t98Pnaa	You guys just need some alone time to spend together. see if you can go away for the weekend.... You need to rekindle your relationship.. Being with someone for 14 years is a long time to just give up and throw it all away... Marraige is about compromise... ask her what you can do to communicate more... maybe you guys should sit down every night and talk about things... as far as the sex goes... try new things. do things you used to do when you first got together... go on dates, try exciting things. You need to try and understand her.. Your wife is supposed to be your best friend. What you should do... is ask her what you asked us... TALK TO HER... thats what communication is about.... or you could take counseling.|`|QePbhS8Caa	Definitely talk her into going to marriage counseling. She's basically just told you that your marriage is dying. You need to do reconnect. Make time to take her out on dates. Find someone to take your kids for the weekend and get away together. Romance her. Couples, especially those with kids, tend to fall into taking each other for granted. You depend on each other, but you don't give much thought to your relationship because there's all this other stuff going on. Marriage takes work. Keeping it alive takes effort. If you want to keep your marriage going ,you have to be committed to doing whatever it takes to get it back on track.|`|rzfwzbgvaa	wow. thats a bit blunt "She says that having sex with me would make her feel no different than having sex with a male friend"    you two really need to have a day or a week with each other, find out why you two got married, when you first saw her etc. if the past is bright then why not look back at it?|`|10d29030429ea7a1527ba8f23128d41eaa	i been through that with my husband and we were not even married as long as you. it will be five years this year for us. i actually had the problem and what i did instead of continually saying mean things and nagging. i changed myself before i can criticize him. the more i change things and did things a little different he started to come around. Then all of a sudden the communication started opening up and he began to tell me why this happen that way etc. I have two kids myself and yes they can take up your time but you have to find ways date each other again. That is what we try to do often. the only thing that would hinder us is money.|`|c87f27f0437532e03040d093f68f1231aa	14 years is a long time to just so easily give up on..  A lot of times you get caught up in routine that you forget to be spontaneous or surprising!Talk to each other about the changes that you each think should be made... take the time to be alone... to work on your relationship!!! on being a couple again.... good luck!!!|`|F9Wqp5YMaa	i will tell you one ting : it is time to flirt and romance again. women needs romantic things -dinners, flowers, presents, romantic words, compliments, thigns that make them feel sexy and special- they also need too much communication, needs to feel beign cared and affection. send the children to grandma and go a holiday with your wife, buy her flowers, some presents, prepare breakfast her in bed a sunday morning. have sex somewhere different. flirt with her. tell her hwo much you are proud of having her.   it is up to you to make your marriage alive again. i think she loves you very much but she needs to feel sexy and like a woman who is loved again. it is normal and it happens to every woman.   also you can get more advise from marriage section.   i know you can make her feel special again. just effort a little.   good luck.|`|q2cRdOV6aa	For the good of your marriage and kids, I strongly think you should see a marriage counselor. It isn't weak to say you need outside help, and it will help in the long run. good luck.|`|cIfle5ckaa	I think that you should ask for a seperation and let things cool for a while  the saying goes absence can make the heart grow fonder    I hope everything works out for you|`|Dr8ViR9Xaa	It sounds as if she's cheating.|`|AA10160596	Ask her out on a date. Make the date something she would never expect. All relationships are perennial. Both of you are what we in the profession call 'humans'. Ups and downs , in and outs. Welcome to life. So get a baby sitter. Get a clue. Get going!|`|nupjbK0Baa	That is rough. First of all let me say I am sorry you are going through this. Women are not like men. Most of them need physical affection. I have what we call "talk time" with my wife. It's a time only for her where we just sit and talk. Mostly she talks and I listen, but she also likes to hear about my life and most importantly my feelings. Write her notes from time to time. Surprise her with flowers. Keeping a relationship going after 14 years is hard. If you have drifted apart then one on one time is the only thing that will fix it. I suggest you start with a hotel night just you do. Don't push sex. It is not necessary. Play card games. Give her an oil backrub and tell her what she means to you. This will not fix it all. It will take a few months but if you do it and continue to talk intimately with her, give her notes, tell her she is pretty it will fix itself. Spend LOTS of time with her.|`|2570b9df07ea87faedc36db3ab90c0e2aa	All couples grow apart, it is very normal. Our marriage has done the same throughout the years. We have had a very good counselor who has helped us from time to time. I totally understand the intimacy on your part as well as hers.  Women have to feel good about the relationship to care about intimacy. What worked for us, was to rediscover why we love one another and care for one another. We looked at the things that were working and built on them. We made sure we had date nights. We did things for one another and pretty soon the intimacy was back in our lives because our love for one another really came back to the surface. We planned romantic evenings and getaways. Our counselor had each of us plan a night that the other person would totally love. It was fun and it showed the other person how much they were cared for. I hope you work it out. You will be happy if you do. Good luck...|`|DIFDYxCWaa	It is so important to keep your relationship tight when you have children. She sounds like she is out of love with you, and may be on her way to cheating. If she doesn't cheat, she will continue to smother herself in her children so she can avoid having to be a wife. If she is willing to try, please try. if she becomes disrespectful, and thoughtless, you have to move on and give your love to your children and another woman who will love and marry you. some ways to spark up the relationship are setting a weekly date night, whisk her away to a bed and breakfast, surprise her with a vow renewal cermony with your closest friends and family, and make sure you tell her and show her how beautiful and sexy she is everday. Kiss her more than once a day, hold her at night. It takes alot of work to keep are partners happy but if you all are willing to work then do it!
Aq7A3EwAaa	Because this is affecting a number of you, I would suggest that you get your parents to complain to the head about the disruption to your studies. If these girls have to be kept in school, then they should be taught separately from the rest of you at such an important time. There is more of you than them so make your voices heard. Good luck in your exams|`|OeLCEPygaa	alright.... i think its about that time to bring on the beat down to those two girls...but you cant let them know who is beating thierass.. come from behind and just cold clock one of them...then you say somthing like "50 harlem crips *****!!! quit messing with my mom in class or ill wax thatass..."    hint: you say that the teacher is your mom so the girls dont think its someone from the class...  your welcome.    or if not that just like put a stink bomb in their car or house so you can  always have something to laugh at while they act up

p3AbTmbfaa	When cheating you must create a line between partner A and partner B. This means never allowing the person you are messing around with to permeate your life completely. You should never allow this person into your home or even near your residence. If possible keep as much personal information, well, personal. Remember that you dont really know person B and if and when you decide to stop communicating with them they may try to retaliate. If you dont believe me, just watch Court TV sometime! So avoid all super personal details like where your partner works, your address, etc. In addition, you will need to cover your tracks at home. Heres the best ways to do this:    1. Drop the Tried Excuses. The first red flag that someone is a cheater is when they continually use the same tired excuse for why they are going to be gone. The most common excuse is work  weather its working late or going in on days off. The bottom line is that people who are suspicious have ways of finding you and work is one of the easiest of them.    2. Keep Your Partner Happy  If you dont want your partner to grow suspicious of your activity its imperative that you keep them happy. Get them flowers or write them a little note every now and again. Let them know that you care and they will be much less suspicious.    3. Avoid Phone Contact. Be sure that your new partner knows not to contact you on your home phone or cel  lular phone. Even text messages can be very risky. Instead communicate through a site like myspace or create a free email account with Yahoo or Hotmail.    4. Never Pay By Credit. A HUGE mistake is paying for anything by credit card or debit card. Not only can you forget to dispose of the receipt but if your partner gets a hold of your bank statement it will be near impossible to explain why you went out to dinner at a romantic restaurant alone or why you filled up your gas tank so far from home or work. So keep cash on hand.    5. Keep Expenses Under Control. A single relationship can be expensive enough, let alone trying to juggle two of them. Dont fall into the trap of blowing money you dont have on your other partner. Its a lost cause and will catch up to you in the end. I have heard so many sob stories about people who have made the mistake of getting themselves thousands of dollars in debt by trying to impress another individual. So if you plan to step out on your partner, do it with realistic financial expectations.    6. Watch Yourself. Are you making up lie after lie? Do you have to fabricate huge stories to cover up for other huge stories? Even if you think you are dating a total idiot, you are not. People are eventually going to see through all of your lies and you will have no way of ever being trusted again. So instead of making up lies try and be truthful. Say only what you really did do and leave out the details. For example, if you did go to the grocery store, tell your partner that. Leave out the fact that you stopped by the coffee house and had a hot chocolate with the other woman. This way you are not creating lies. Basically, follow the dont ask dont tell policy.    7. Dont Use Friends. Never try and have your friends cover for you. In fact, dont even tell your friends about your affair. Friends can accidentally or on-purpose spill the beans about your activity. Keep your business to yourself and you wont have to worry about getting told on.    8. Keep Your Distance  Dont cheat with a neighbor, one of his coworkers, a relative or anybody that is in any way connected to your partner.    Finally, the best rule of advice is not to cheat. No matter how hard you try to do it you will have to live with knowing that you have been unfaithful. And, like the saying says, All good thing  s must come to an end. Is it worth losing your husband or wife? Children? House? If you answered yes to those questions then why not just make the decision to leave those things?|`|EENUWAP7aa	Tanner, that is a crock, cheaters is for losers. Your not a loser are you?|`|I814g6ZBaa	...and it seems to be mostly for the really unattractive, the really stupid, and people in trailer parks.|`|f6YsGOynaa	Yep...and oftentimes the other person is NOT cheating...and reality television has once again sucked the brains out of the American viewing public, as well as taking away the civil rights of the person being followed.

zmqN0M86aa	I always just say something along the lines of, "Oh that's a lovely/cute idea!"  and forget about it later.  At the end of the day everyone knows that it's mine and my fiance's wedding, not anyone else's.    A lot people just get really excited about weddings, especially female family members, and especially moms.  My fmil is constantly giving me ideas.  She is so very excited because she got married at the courthouse and has hardly been to any weddings, bless her heart.  I love her to death but some of her ideas are not that great at all.  Do I tell her that?  Not really.  I think it's best to let everyone give their 2 cents, they're just really excited, that's all.  You don't have to take their ideas to heart, but you can still let them share in the "fun" of wedding planning.  As long as they're not insisting or actually forcing you to do something you don't want to do, it's all good.  At the end of the day, you're the one that takes those ideas and executes them.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	thanks i'll look into that and see which way works best for the kind of day we'd like to have.    and then face the fact that you just may have to offend her. some people live that way, and there's not much you can do about it.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Can you say-we will think about it? Is she paying for the wedding? I would have your fiance talk with her.    You could also try and give her a project that she can be in charge of planning so she doesn't feel left out.|`|AA10776535	I just say thank you and do whatever i want.  Don't explain or say anything more than that, this way you dont have to worry about offending her.|`|tHjgIapraa	Just say "thank you for your input" and smile.  :)|`|sLLgERQWaa	Smile, say thankyou for your input, then do what you want to as long as it doesn't break the law just be aware of the fact that if it flies in the face of good manners people will comment-can't avoid it.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	I just smile and say, "Thanks for the input, I'll take it into consideration."     I had a lot of people doing this to me early on and eventually I just learned to say "Good" when people asked how the planning was coming and I give as vague answers as I can to avoid unwanted prying. Definitely annoying!    God luck!|`|Byz59nRGaa	You can tell them that it's definitely something to consider but ultimately the decision will be taken between yourself and your spouse.|`|QsbB6vkoaa	you only have to thank them, i mean you don't even have to say i'll do it or i wont do it.  just be nice, after all they are just trying to be helpful.  it's your wedding that's what you have to keep in mind, and they wont even get hurt since they know that it's your opinion that counts.  for my sisters party everybody was so opinionated and she was polite and just said thank you then after a few days they would ask her "so did you call the photographer we suggested?" and she was like " oh, i was going to but then i found this great photographer that was available that day" and they would just leave her alone.   and if they try and pressure you into doing something you don't want, just tell them " you know i just don't see my wedding having (whatever it is they suggested).   hope this helps.  have a happy wedding day :)|`|63P7Q4hoaa	to be honest, my face would go blank and everyone would just laugh because they know that i don't really like it|`|ECe1rgsdaa	Just say, "I'll have to think about that!" with some enthusiasm. This way they made their point, but you haven't committed to anything.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	If they are trying to change an idea you already have, say "I appreciate your opinions, but this is what I would like to do"    Or, if it's just an idea thrown at you, be honest and be like "I like it but it's not my style..."    Or, "Thanks for all your help, but I'm looking at doing something like this... Any ideas"  That way they don't feel totally shot down...|`|kUE3Ddktaa	You say, graciously, "What a nice idea. I'll have to give that some thought." And then you change the subject and talk about something else.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi and congratulations!    Oh....the joys.  I always wonder what it is about weddings where people think they can give their ideas and opinions even when NOT asked.    You know what I would do....simply say, "oh, I will think about it."  OR...."thanks, I will think about it."  Then...do as YOU please.  There is really no way around it without being as rude to them as they are to you.  Just smile and say, "thanks, I'll think about it."    Most definitely, do things as YOU (and your fiance) want....NOT what others want!    Good luck and I hope you have a beautiful day.|`|nqINitkmaa	I would say things like that's a good idea but I already of a picture in my head of what I want it to be like. Or oh I like that Idea I wish I would have thought of it before I put the deposit down. Try to take it as if you like the idea. In the end its your day and your way! Congrats!|`|hkwBR1moaa	Is this a trick question?  Because basically you are asking us for opinions!  lol  Just kidding.  Listen to the opinions and politely let them know you are going a different route.|`|7CKipTZOaa	I smile and nod, and if they persist I will firmly say that just isn't for me.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Smile, thank the person for their input, and do things the way you feel they should be done.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	I just pretend to like their opinion and then ignore it completely later.  The following sentence has been said a lot by me lately:  "oh really? thanks! I'm going to have to look into it" and then, of course, I never do. lol|`|55zWUXcUaa	I always smile and graciously say oh wow that's a great idea I'll keep that in mind.  Then I just don't use it.  Or if they don't know I still need something (Like say they want you to wear an ugly pair of earrings that they loan you) you can say oh those are nice, but I already purchased these.      I don't know what to tell you about your FMIL just try not to let on you don't like her ideas.  I know it's tough sometimes.

ndQkhqZeaa	Haven't you ever had a thought and before you could express it to the correct person, another person mentions something similar?    That is probably what he means by that. And he seems he is going to discuss it with you.    Consider yourself lucky that you have a BF that wants to communicate :)

The car was not because you had to have it, or got talked into it. You got the new car because when she's with you she deserves to be seen in something as hot as she is. Compliments will get you everywhere my friend. I would leave out the details of the salesmen as this will only confuse matters and lead to questions that might get you in trouble.

OIJ3JBkSaa	you'd be surprised at how quickly those pennies add up - try cutting out the 'little things'.  get yourself a big jar or tin to put your money in on a daily basis, once every few weeks take it to the bank and put it in a totally separate savings account marked 'wedding'.  okay starting tomorrow:  every day when you get home at the end of the day whatever change you have in your pocket you throw it into that jar or tin.  stop buying reading material - go to the libarary and borrow books and magazines.   stop your newspaper subscription and read the news on the computer or watch it on t.v.  stop buying magazine subscriptions.  drop your hi-speed internet - in our end of the world that is a twelve dollar a month savings right there.  give up one either your cell-phone or your land-line.  you don't need to have both.  give up your lattes!  instead of one every day cut down to two a week.  stop ordering in - you can cook - its cheaper and you'll save quite a bit.  stop eating out so often - do it for special occasions only.  stop going to the movies!  rent videos or just watch whatever is on t.v.  you don't need to spend so much on clothes or shoes - be practical!  groceries - the store brands are generally as good as name brands so buy the store brands.  soap is soap - i don't care what they say oil of olay or dove are as good as anything - and far cheaper than the big brands.  no one needs a dozen different lipsticks and eyeshadows - cut down on your makeup.    find a less expensive hairdresser.   paying cash for everything will save you banking fees and credit charges and will make it easier for you to stick to the plan of putting money in your 'wedding jar' because if you save ten dollars on your grocery bill you'll put that ten into the container soon as you get home!  you didn't spend that four bucks today on a latte?  it goes in the jar!  immediately upon getting home put that money in the jar.  you will find the money adds up quickly sweetie.  also if you can afford to put fifty dollars a month into the wedding account on top of everything else.    good luck to you and happy saving!!!!!|`|JCAgvgTxaa	I think you are going at this backwards.  How much do you have saved already?  How much can you add to that in the next year?    Base your budget on what you have now combined with what you can save within the next year.      Take that amount, and plug it into the Knot's budget calculator.  http://wedding.theknot.com/default.aspx?...  The budget calculator will show you what percentage of your budget should be spent on each item.    Work with the money you have now, downsizing your wedding plans if necessary.  I think it is senseless to be together and saving, saving, saving  for a wedding for five, six, seven years.      Go to the courthouse if necessary.  But I think if two people truly want to wed, they can make it happen within a year to 18 months.    A wedding is just one day.  A marriage can last a lifetime.  Get started on the lifetime together . . . and forget about spending all your money on just one day.    Take what you have now combined with what you can save in a year . . . and get started with your planning.  Good luck.|`|4CMQuJgOaa	We got married on $5K you will be just fine...    I would recommend putting away $100 a week each, open an ING account on line their interest rates are usually pretty good and have it drafted weekly so you never see it!     That's $200 a week at 52wks a year would be $10400 since this month is over start next month and you will be short few hundred dollars...You will be ready to marry this time next year~       http://home.ingdirect.com/|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Write it out and figure out how much money is left after bills each month or week. If you can do $100/week or $200 every 2 weeks that's $400/month. That will help you figure it out. You can open another account and have the funds automatically deposited just to ensure that they get in there plus you never miss what you never see!    Good luck!|`|qttPOdRBaa	I don't know what Wedding cost where you live, but looking at prices today, you need at least $25,000.  Start saving you Income tax and bonuses and Stimulas checks now...|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.  It's too hard for any of us to figure out a budget as we don't know any of your "incidental" expenses and what you pay for food and gas per month.    The thing to remember is this:  what your W2 says and what you actually "bring home" are two different numbers.  Remember, your W2 is "gross" earnings....not "take home" earnings.    The easiest way to do this is for the two of you to sit down and figure it out.    ~ Start with what you "bring home" per month.....write that down.  ~ Then write down all of your bills.  ~ Write down what you can estimate for food and gas for the month.  ~ Then, any incidental bills that may come up (doctor bills? birthdays?), etc. and allow a little for that.    ~ Then write down EXACTLY what you spend your money on.  Do you eat lunch out everyday?  Do you go to Starbucks?  Out to the movies?      The easiest way to save is to "do without" as tough as that is.  Don't spend any extra money on lunches (bring your own), coffees, movies, new clothes, etc.    That's the only way I know of to save!  Good luck.|`|ETHdEtPQaa	based on the info i would say that you can put 500 each a month in a separate bank account. that's a thousand dollars every month that's gaining interest as well. so in a year you have enough for your wedding and honeymoon. you collectively pay 1260 a month on bills. then you roughly make about 3000 a month. so you would still have 740 a month to play around with for yourselves.|`|pub2GLZPaa	Set up an account with ING direct. They have a program called a "goal getter". You put in the amount you want saved (10,000) and the date by which you want to have it (whenever is about a year before your wedding, so you can start making deposits and etc). The calculator will tell you how much you will have to save on a weekly, biweekly, monthly etc basis.     From that, you can have that amount automatically shifted into the ING account when you get paid. You don't even see the funds, but have access to them if you need them. No fees.

I mean, how much more obvious could he have made it that he was a troll?    The ones I'm sometimes unsure about are the ones that read like they've been written by foreign women, where they say they've been married a couple of months but haven't been able to have sex yet.  There was one of those just a few minutes ago.  Could that be real???    Edit: I have a couple of examples for you.  Here's one that's just so outrageous that it simply has to be a troll.  No reasonable person would have any need to ask such a question:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...

5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	As you can tell from answers, it totally varies here. However, where I'm from, most have at least a six hour reception...  Sample timeline --  Ceremony - 2 or 3 p.m., you are out of the church in an hour usually, then you go for photographs.    Cocktails 5 p.m.  Dinner 6 p.m., then program  Those times are obviously changeable....  About an hour and a half for dinner, then have the cake cutting - takes about 20 min for pics.  Dance starts about 8 - 8:30 -   Break for bouquet toss/garter throw and late lunch, about 10:30  Dancing til 12 - 1 -- depending how long you have your venue for, your dj, your liquor permit.  ---  We had our ceremony at 2:30, the rest as above.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	at least 4 hours|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Most reception venues allow you 4 hrs from start to finish, including dinner and then kick you out. That doesn't leave very much time for dancing and other activities.    An appetizer or dessert reception is 2-3 hrs max.     It all depends on what you want. If you want a longer reception and you don't want to feel rushed at all, then do that but make sure that the venue allows the extra time and doesn't charge for it. There are venues that allow you to be there for 12-24 hrs and don't charge hourly fees after the first 4 are up.|`|FzUoB9qkaa	Hi,    4-5 hours is the normal amount of time for the reception.    As for the time of day, it depends on you and your budget.  You can save quite a bit of money by having your event in the afternoon as opposed to the evening especially if it is an informal affair.  For very formal weddings evenings are usually the norm.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	Most typical reception venues already have it blocked out for reception times, such as a five hour reception package.

Mine is starting at 8:30 and ending at 11:30.  That's pm. and it's plenty of time for a reception.  Are you planning on having your ceremony there too?  If so, book it for 4-5 hours.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	for instance, my daugher's wedding will be around 3:30, with the reception hall open immediately following while pix are taken.  the bar will be open 4-5, and dinner is from 5-6:30, with the whole shindig ending at 930.  i think that's fairly typical time length, altho the actual times will vary depending on the venue and the time you want for your wedding/reception.

tJel8yiFaa	Recommend the typical seduction stuff. But start with the mind. Send him a note, pay him compliments, brush up against him.

You want to make love and it is just sex tothem. I wish I could help you because I wouldn't want another nice person going through what i have had to endure. Some people say divorce, but that doesn't seem like the right answer for me either. Love in a relationship is not just sex, but I think it is criminal to hold out on ones spouse regularly.

First of all, have u told him how u feel? How much you want to be with him? U want to be with him more than just once a month? Communication is key. When I want something I ask for it. I don't feel ashamed to ask my bf for more sex.   He could also just be very tired. Once again, u guys need to communicate and find out why.  Secondly, it's not just about dressing sexy. Do you walk around your man naked? Make a naked dinner, wait for him naked when he gets home from work...  Thirdly, toys... It can always spice up a relationship. U can also get sexy board games. They really help and make things interesting. Blind fold...  Hope this helps. That's how I keep my relationship interesting. Try! Good luck:)|`|pVnUhYLQaa	I wasn't going to say dress sexy, but I find it interesting that you said "besides dress sexy"; why is that?     Have you talked to him about this? Do you talk about sex at all? I mean sit down with a glass of wine/beer/mixed drink/whatever and have a conversation about sex. I find just talking about sex with my girlfriend makes both of us want it. But besides that, communication is so important in relationships, it seems to me that there would be a lot less questions on this site if more people asked each other questions instead of internet strangers.     Do you have any fantasies? does he know them? do you know his? could you get into any kink? BDSM? role play? etc...    Talk to him, tell him your wants and concerns, find out what gets him hot and do it. Tell him what gets you hot and ask/tell him to do it. Communication is the key.    EDIT: DUG below me has a good point. My girlfriend and I exchange text all day. We talk dirty to each other and we send dirty pics to each other.

Many men have this problem ( which aggravates me because I am single and care about women). Talk to him and see. Ask if he finds you attractive or if he loves you, etc. Many women do that already, but talk to him about it. Talk to him about your needs. He needs to be sensitive to your needs. Communication is the big key. If one-on-one conversation doesn't work, get a counselor or priest involved (I only say priest if you are religious).    That is the best I can think of. Communicate, communicate, communicate.|`|NrwJyffxaa	Don't wait for him to come home to start foreplay.  Do things that will remind him of sex during the day.   Put a pair of panties in his brief case.  Send him a text/email.   Put a condom on his gear shift in his car.  Make sure what ever you do doesn't get out in public eyes so you don't embarrass him or yourself.  Put things in his socks or shoes.  Leave him voice messages.  If he thinks about sex enough he will want it more. It will really help if you can twist a word that he has to use at work everyday to have a double meaning.  ie if he is a accountant use something corney like Does my figure make your balance add up.  As you say figure makes sure he sees your hands on your breast then as you say add up make sure your hand is on what you want to be adding up.    He probably has a busy life make him stop and smell the roses.|`|ZCxeEwXZaa	I really wonder whats wrong with some of these husbands that are not having sex with their wife. It really confuses me. When I was married I wanted it from my wife all the time. She would have to beat me off with a stick to stay away from her. Sorry back to your problem - I would sit down and talk with him about it and try to go on dates and when he is comes home from work greet him naked or hardly anything on. If stuff like that doesn't work see if he will go with you to marriage counseling or someone that you both trust that you can talk about it. Communication is the key and he could just be stressed and worried and that could take away some of the sex drive. Show him this question too that might help.  Edit - Seriously like another guy said why didn't I marry someone like you. When I find another girl some day that will deffinately be something to discuss before marriage. It shouldn't be a reward it should be done as an act of love and wanting to be close to you. Not like its some kind of a brownie treat. Good luck I hope you can come to a happy medium with him.
Wok0Y6ebaa	Keep your distance.  Stop going to the bars that he is in, and avoid him at all costs.  You are not a piece of property, you are a person, and he has no respect for how you feel or what you want to do with your life.  Don't settle for a guy that is going to put you through that.  Good luck!!|`|lJhl3wLAaa	Stop hanging out in bars where you might run into your ex.   Go to school or college and meet from new friends that don't hang out where gang members hang.   Move|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Get a restraining order or do not contact . Get a tougher boyfriend that can beat him up.
fHfVRcqbaa	My relationship with my husband is the most important relationship I have.  When my kids grow up and move on, my husband will still be there.  He is my lifemate, my lover, and my best friend.  He is my partner in every way and I will never love another person the way I love him.    I am responsible for my child's life.  I would do anything to see my child safe, to include forsaking my spouse.  If I had to choose between saving the two, I would save my child.  It is my job to protect him and to guide him through childhood into the adult he will become.    Two different loves that cannot be compared in any way to each other.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	wife first then the kids then if any left  meeeeeeeeeeee...... i guess ..as happy wife happy life ..true ..|`|a1ymHaWAaa	CHILDREN ALWAYZ|`|62f1d0961574fb4ceb5c3f96048930aaaa	Your children should ALWAYS come first.  That doesnt mean you mistreat your spouse, it doesnt mean you toss them aside like scraps. It just means that when it comes to who's happier it should be your children, your spouse is grown person.  Your children are young, vulnerable and need YOU to protect and care for them.  Now if they're adults, old enought to make their own lives, choices, decisions then definitely your spouse will come first.  Ideally though, you and your spouse should be one force, together, in agreement that whatever you BOTH do in life, it's for the benefit of your children.  I have told my hubby that there are only two reasons I would divorce him  1) Infidelity and 2) Child abuse or mistreatment.|`|uGFzzLYWaa	My daughter always come first.|`|AA11604319	I have been brought up to believe that your children are on loan from God.  Once they are raised, you only have yourself and your spouse.  I don't love my children more or less than my husband, I love them different.    When God chooses to take your children back and help them live their own lives, you have your always and forever with your spouse.|`|qms67wSWaa	my husband first !!|`|PQmMAUFXaa	No matter what...I will ALWAYS love my children more, and they will ALWAYS come first.  People always say you have to love your spouse first, then your kids, so you can have a happy marriage.  I disagree.  Now yes, I will take the side of my husband if the kids are being unruly or unreasonable, but other than that, the kids come first.  My oldest is very smart for her age.  When my husband asked me to marry him, she was there, and I asked her too.  I told him yes, as long as she thought it was ok.  If there was ever any doubt, though, as to what kind of husband or father he would be, and she didn't want to be in that situation, that he was gone.  I guess it stems from my past relationships, and how her father and a couple others treated us.  I will NOT see her suffer for my own selfish happiness.  My kids are part of me.  They are the reason I get up every day, the reason I breathe.  I guess there are different types of love between spouses and kids, but I will always love my kids more.  They are me....|`|vLgbjmI2aa	You shouldnt have to choose.You dont choose.You love them equally just a different kind of love is all.|`|AA10798898	If you put your children on the back burner they most likely will become angry towards you w/ time....children come 1st.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	both my husband and my son are very important to me.  i would protect my son first. children need our love ,guidance and protection more.   my son is the most important person in my life. I love my new husband dearly. and i would also do anything for him. my new husband it not my sons dad. i would choose my son first. I am all my sons has. his dad has nothing to do with him my sons grandma on his dads side is dead and his aunts on his dads side live in other countries one lives in canada and one in germany my son does not know he uncle on his dads side.|`|yKWMSUd3aa	The love you have for your spouse is a different type of love you have for your children.  I am a wife and a mom of 3..  I love my husband dearly with all of my heart in a loving, romantic, kinda way.. I love my children with all my heart as well,  but it is more of a nurturing, protecting, guiding kind of love.  There is a difference,  but as far as saying who I love the most my spouse or my kids,  I love them all unconditionallly.|`|b8hYavVoaa	Children, as long as you are there for them they will never let you down by not showing love. A marriage can go wrong, someone can betray the other person. Children always come first.|`|niSRQw53aa	My children hands down!  I divorced my husband after he broke my face.  At that point, I realized that staying in the marriage FOR the children was wrong and leaving FOR the children was right.  Their mental and emotional stability was most important.  And because of my love for them I did not want them to grow up thinking it was okay for a husband to beat his wife.       I always loved my husband but I always loved my children more.  They always come first.  NO MAN will EVER come before them.  My children will always be there for me.  Blood is thicker than water and spouses are water, children are blood.    Same thing goes if I marry someone in the future.  If they hurt me or my children, they are gone.  My job as a mother is to have unconditional love for my girls and to always protect and nurture them.  And I love that job!    My ex-husband chooses his 'flavor of the month' over his girls all the time.  And they are old enough to see this and have no respect for him as a result.  His actions make them feel as if he doesn't love them.  As a result, I give them all the love and stability I can.  I play mom and dad since he sucks at the dad job.|`|a1FsOfyLaa	My kids will always be more important to me and to my husband. Your spouse should be no competition to your children and you should never even have to ask yourself that question.Your childrenare your flesh and blood and can NEVER be replaced, but a spouse can. I love my husband more than anything, but I could love someone else if I had to, but I can never replace a child or the love of a child.
S9p8E8hBaa	After kids that tends to happen. I think there is a problem if the man stops wanting it but I think it is actually normal for a woman to feel that way. If a man stops wanting his wife, there usually is someone in the picture who is fulfilling his needs.|`|gGCHYlxGaa	I dont know who you are talking to but 14 years in the game i cant have enough of it|`|RmNcwfT9aa	After the first 5 we had a drop off, plus 2 babies, then at about 8 yrs, it heated up a little. Now after 17 years, it is better than ever, kids are growing up, financially a little better, health a little better, Sex, much better.  Every couple has their ups and downs, living through the downs makes the ups even better.|`|e5FoLh2Paa	Married for nine years--he's 54, I'm 38.  The sex is still great--but only because we have a great marriage also.  The sex is an added bonus!|`|4gZYucHMaa	that's no marriage then! You have to have a certain level of intimacy to keep the fires going!|`|W1rCsvTzaa	After 20 years still 2-3 times a week.  And it is really great.  My wife and I have both stayed really fit which is part of it.  Many of my friends wives have added 2-3 pounds a year and after 20 years they are 50 lbs heavier - sorry but that would really bum me out if that happened to us.|`|AA10447831	sure- going on 34 years so forget that broken hip stuff|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	Damn it that better not happen!  I have been with my husband for 9 years, married for 5 months, things are still going strong in that department for us.  I guess it did slow down a bit, but it didn't stop.  Plus, at first when you are getting to know each other the sex is just okay, when you have been together for a long time it's all about quality not quantity.|`|4o3jXz3Waa	I am definitely still intimate with my husband.  After almost 14 years of marriage I still have a very high sex drive, actually more so than he does, lol.  I can't relate to women who over time lose their desire to be intimate.  I like to keep the home fires burning!|`|GGSSxFsUaa	Not true! Stopped completely for you or him? Is he having a medical condition? If not there is no reason a otherwise healthy man would just stop having sex. I doubt this very seriously and I hate to say it but, he must be getting it from his another woman. You should start investigating into his free time.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	I have been married for 12 years and we still have sex (good sex at that) several times a week.|`|uXeGsxSVaa	Maybe after 40 years lol, after i will be in danger of breaking my hip during, but 5-8 years? What did someone gain too much weight or stopped taking showers or something?|`|e2099d20a6fdd2c84c032e222b17db4faa	I have been married for almost 13 years, yes the intimacy is still there.|`|AA11969451	I feel very sorry for those people. It is my experience that the physical intimacy is more intense.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	Together 16, married for 11. We totally have intimate relations all the time. Kissing, hugging, sex, showering together whatever.|`|gfHutvEFaa	Married almost 13 years, and honestly the passion is there! I love him more today (you've heard this, I know), he is my best friend, soul mate and lover.   We spice it up in the bedroom a lot, have great talks and just respect one another.    I feel lucky everytime he touches me.|`|vLgbjmI2aa	I have been with my husband for over 8 yrs.and we are still very intimate.I love being intimate with my husband in conversation and in touch!When he kisses me i still shiver and tingle from head to toe.Each time better than the last.I think that is sad if you and your husband dont have that.Find a way to get it back.Have some one on one time(go to dinner,a movie,a walk on the beach and then watch the sunset,have a picnic and chat over some food and a glass of wine).Go back to the time when you had that intimacy and what made  you  feel that way.Obviously some things have changed, maybe over the yrs.you two have just gotten to busy with life to remember what it really means to love eachother and make eachother feel special..You can get it back if you really want to.|`|e4SflIigaa	wow been 2gether 10 years, we have sex 4 times a week twince on sundays,,lol we love sex    Edit   you guys should go to Clubmed or hedonism in jamaica that'll bring the fire back|`|2Xw4Tm0Taa	That's just sad.  I will be intimate w/my husband regularly until one or the other dies.|`|rE9UfNeEaa	Been married for 20 yrs and sex gets better every year, Has never stopped even for a while.
ej8iwJzqaa	wow !! im sure your hubby will be a very happy man !!  its very high class looking, good luck- have a wonderful marriage|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Very pretty dress, have you tried it on? That will be the best indication of how it will look. I would say that it will add height due to the long lines the pleats create but I worry that the top may create linebacker shoulders. However, the only way to tell is to find a dealer and try it!    Good luck!|`|2o2jCzryaa	i really do like the dress but i think its the color. I think your a very pretty girl and i think the dress needs more color something bright that will make you stand out!! No matter what it will be your day and you will look amazing!! Good luck!|`|3WQOa4sraa	Im not a fan of the dress, would probably have to see it in ivory    you look very beautiful, I can see you wearing a more simple floaty gown but yet I dont know your character    go and try it on or a similar style|`|yXaob7wNaa	OMG!!! You would look gorgeous in that dress. You have a great figure and that is a fabulous dress! Good Luck!|`|e5FoLh2Paa	No.  You look too short for that dress, regardless of the type of shoes you wear.|`|g7wxHGjeaa	yes it will! just make sure it isnt to long (im 5'5) and i think i would trip on that, you dont want to spend your whole wedding feeling like you will fall on your face. try to tone up your arms abit though and the dress will look amzing good luck and congratulations! :D   were did you get the dress? link please? I love the style and want to see what else they make :D    edit: my bad it says on the pictures ;p|`|6dbb12cad0e32f793a90d33f0e0c9ae1aa	i think the back is gorgeous. i think that kind of neckline can be really hard to pull off, that would be my only concern|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	I don't know, the model looks long and lean and that works with the silhouette of that dress.  if you're not really long waisted like she is, it will look entirely different. go try it on!  it is a beautiful dress.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	The fact that the skirt of the dress pleats vertically, will give you height...    So I think it's a great choice.  :)    BTW, I love the top of the dress...  Very cute!!|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Gorgeous gown - very elegant.  Enjoy your day!|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Its stunning but I believe the gold would look amazing on your with your skin tone.  Go for it you will looking gorgeous on your big day.|`|UgcPxd4maa	I think it would look amazing on you! Congrats!!|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	you'd really have to try it on to be sure.  my daughter tried on many dresses she thought she'd like, but ended up picking out one that she passed over on the hanger!    i do think it would probably look sensational on you, but you really have to try it on.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	that is a beautiful dress. it will look great on you|`|d62310b3e25bb263db275c523c9cfe86aa	I think the shape of the dress would like fine, but I think it has a lot going on-- a little busy. You have such a pretty face, don't let a dress take away from that.  However, if you like it and it is your dream dress, go for it. Dont let anyone on here stop you.|`|7G4hisdzaa	It's hard for me to tell.  The model is very tall, you look very short (like me!).  I'm wondering what the top of the dress is going to look like on you.  I don't think it will look BAD, but I really think it will look different since your torso will be shorter than the models.   Just my 2 cents.  It's a gorgeous dress!|`|JCAgvgTxaa	That gown is beautiful, absolutely beautiful.  You will be a stunning bride.|`|ZkeoRyy3aa	I actually think this dress is much too over the top.  I don't think it will be what your future husband will be expecting, but then again I don't know him.|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	I think it's a beautiful dress and you would look great in it. But you might have a problem with your height. Because the dress is so ornate and dramatic on shorter women the dress can look too overwhelming. With heels you should be fine.|`|cYioBe3Kaa	what kind of wedding are you having? thats also a factor. but anyway, the dress is very nice, but i think there is too much going on at the top of the gown with the neckline and all, it will overwhelm your cute face. i would go with something brighter than that as well, since you have dark skin.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Well, the dress is really different than any I have seen, I like the bodice and the side draping isn't overwhelming or bulky.  You are nice and curvy, so it seems it would suit you well!|`|Ye9xBchRaa	wow your cute and lucky guy.  how much was it don't spend all your money on a dress. Im sure it will be fine your gonna have a beautiful day.
28WJwHf4aa	1. No, I don't believe the bigger the better, but to each her own.    2. Our budget was 12k, and we stuck to it.    3 & 4. I think our budget was perfect. We did have to make different arrangements, such as getting married outside of the city, to keep costs down, but in the end, it was almost perfect.    5. No, I didn't hire a wedding planner. I had enough time to plan out our wedding as our engagement was 17 mos. long    6. No, it didn't leave us in debt. 15 mos. before our wedding date, we opened up a savings account specifically for our wedding fund. We decided on a set amount of money to take out of both of our paychecks and we stuck to it. By the time our wedding rolled around, our wedding and honeymoon were completely paid for, with plenty left over.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	I do not believe the bigger the better. You can have a very nice small wedding.    Our budget is between $6,000 and $7,000 not including honeymoon. We will be staying within it. That is why there is a grand leeway.     Our budget was fairly small, I have definitely seen smaller though! I feel it is better than ok, because we get a gorgeous wedding, and it reflects us. We have to pay for most of it ourselves, and it will be perfect! You don't always need $20,000 to have a nice wedding.    I did not hire wedding planner, because I like doing these sorts of things, and I felt it was a waste of money to pay someone to do something I could do myself.    It will not leave us in debt because we made sure to have a long engagement (over 2 years) to save up for it.    Hope this helps! :)|`|0Id85yiYaa	- no  - don't have a budget. i'm only spending $5000, but i didn't set a limit b/c i know that my fiance and i want what we want and will keep it within reason.  - i'm having a destination wedding; therefore i almost HAVE to have a planner. as long as i get married there, i get a planner for free.  - no|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	1. Bigger is better for some, not for others.  It was important to my husband and me to have all the people we were really close to at our wedding.  That came to about 100. You judge whether that's big or not.  If the guest list of people we really watned there had been 200, we'd have found a way to have a weddign that size.  If we had come up with only 50 guests, that's the size we would have had.  It was all about having the people we care about there, not about any particular sized-wedding.  2. Our original budget was $10,000.  Fairly early on, we realized that wouldn't be enough, so we upped the budget--and our savings--to $13,000.  3.  Again, I don't know if $13,000 is large or small.  We felt it was the right amount for us to have the kind of wedding we wanted, with the people we wanted there.    4.  We did not hire a wedding planner because our venue took care of all the little details there, and we were quite well able to make decisions about invitations, centerpieces, clothes, cake, etc. without one.  Early on we had considered one when we were looking at venues that didn't include anything but the venue, and we would have been responsible for finding caterers, tables, chairs, linens, bartenders, waitstaff, china and glassware, etc.  Neither one of us had the time or the interest in pulling all of that together.  5. We saved all of the money for the wedding ourselves: no help from any relatives, and no debt.|`|sLLgERQWaa	1) No.  2) 2,000.00 and yes.  3) smaller budget....nothing wrong with what you can afford  4) No, just stay organized with a plan and wedding planners are then not needed  5) Nope, no debt....spent what could be afforded...would do it all over again the same way.    note* it was a second marriage for both of us & we are in our 50's....we kept it small and simple.|`|gK0vcdnDaa	1. The bigger the better?  Bigger in what meaning of the word?  Amount of people on the guest list, money spent, lavish details?  My venue will only accomodate 100 including the wedding party and all related peoples.  We are choosing quality over quantity - I believe we could easily have a guest list over 500 people, but of those whom would we not notice?  We are choosing to have a private ceremony and a public reception.    2. Our budget $12,475 and so far we are right on target with a few extra dollars for gratuity!    3&4. I feel that our budget is right for us, we had to pick and choose the important things and decide what could be cut down.  I see how weddings could easily get out of hand, but we are practical and money smart.    5. No hired wedding planner, I guess you could call me a DIY Bride.     6. No debt for us, we started saving about $1200/month about 10 months in advance.  Thats about 1/2 my income and we have his to pay all the bills till then, so even if we come up a little short we will have a healthy savings.  In these downtrodden economic times saving money and not putting it on a credit card is essential.      My Fiancee being in the military helps us our immensly, I think that if we were working average jobs and facing possible lay-offs in the current market that we'd opt for a courthouse wedding or we'd insist on going forth with just what we have paid for thus far: My dress, the ceremony location, out officiant and the photographer.  The rest of it really could throw together for under $1000 saving us a few grand, but I want to do it rght by me, and not look back in the future kicking myself for rushing and skimping on the celebration.  90% of our guests are travelling, so we are also hosting/funding a day-after mini vacation so that the guests get something "more" out of the travel.    Good luck with your research!    -Elle|`|oYYcFMDcaa	We are planning a wedding for 80-100 people in my In-laws large backyard and property.  Our budget is $4000 and we have to ask our parents and family friends to help pay for most of it, since we have little to put towards it.  We plan to skip a caterer and planner. We have used many of our friends as resources for photography, DJ, and making invitations.  We will probably ask our favourite local family restaurant to make some food, our parents will make food, and maybe do the rest potluck style, but haven't decided.  We will go to a local farm for flowers.  I've been getting decorations on Ebay for 70-80$ off retail.    We don't believe in going into debt for one day of your life when you can use that money to enjoy the rest of it.  Our wedding is about family being together and not about putting on a show about how much money we spent.  I am very proud and love to look good and have nice things, but we are doing it in a way that we can afford.  I am getting my dress made in China for very cheap.|`|YFxOzl0daa	Do you believe the bigger the better?  NO     If you dont mind sharing, What was your budget and did you stay within it?  - $25K    If your budget was large, why did you feel that was ok. enough for my wedding.    If your budget was small why did you feel that was ok. n/a      Would you or did you hire a wedding planner? - NO, but will have a wedding coordinator provided my the venue    Did the cost of your wedding leave you in debt as you started your new life together?  - I hope not      the wedding will be Dec 09'|`|63P7Q4hoaa	i got married just days ago...    i think that the bigger, the better, the funner (if there's such a word)    our budget was supposed to be $40,000 and i went over by $20,000    i really think that it was okay because i realized that i'm only getting married once in my lifetime and we both thought that we should just make the best out of it.    yes, my wedding planner helped me so much, i meant it so worth it, i didn't need to worry about anything, like i wasn't stressed at all..    no, not really, we have prepared for it... we stated saving 6  years ago...
4o3jXz3Waa	This situation isn't even about that girl......it's about the boyfriend.  He continues to be friends with her even though he knows she's into him and it makes his girlfriend uncomfortable.  He has no respect for his girlfriend's feelings and he is on an ego trip with the attention he's getting from the other girl.  Sounds like your friend needs to get her boyfriend in check or kick him to the curb.|`|lTNcvqyHaa	That is the nature of the beast - Males and Females - best advice - Stay away|`|sLLgERQWaa	Why are some men....it's a personality thing, not a gender thing.|`|QdXvBOL7aa	i would f***ing yell at her and tell her to back off!!|`|i1rDJY2aaa	It's not strictly women, men do it too, probably more so.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	I thought the same thing, when i read the story about how Eve made Adam eat the damn apple.|`|6sTsDvKmaa	Why are some girls w*****? Why are some guys players?  Because that's life.  There will always be manipulative women, and there will always be manipulative men, because unfortunately, there will always be gullible men/women that'll fall for their games.      The trick is to find the guys/gals that don't fall for the manipulation, because they're the ones really worth pursuing.|`|L2pkns9maa	I would corner her, get her really scared and act like im going to knock her block off, then grab up her clothes, yell at her and call heer names for a good 10 mins, tell her if she ever threatens their relationship again i wont let her off.|`|oEOo9U7iaa	If I had a vagina, I would be manipulative too  Unfortunately I don't.

They had sex in my basement while I was asleep. They both said nothing was ever going on before that but Idon't believe it. Watch carefully not just on her but on him too!!!|`|FOpR2Cwzaa	Girls like that are insecure, love drama, and making other people miserable makes them feel better about their own misery.  I would say just stay out of it.  Let your friend and her boyfriend deal with it on their own.  There was a girl who was that way with my husband before we were married, not quite as vulgar and abrasive, but she made him a myspace page he didn't even know about with pictures of them all over it.  She even answered all the questions like about him, what his favorite movies, books, and music are, etc.  I told him that if he didn't handle it, then I would.  I told them that I didn't want to ruin his friendship with her, but that he needed to realize she was not respecting our relationship.  He got on his myspace, changed his profile, filled out all the questions himself, and put pictures of us all over it.  Then he distanced himself from her and now they hardly even talk.

kz9O7QKwaa	I once told my boss my power went off after a storm, and my alarm clock did not go off. Another time I had a friend who lives across the street from my job. I went over to visit, ended up getting real drunk. Spent the night. Called in sick the next day.

NUWdgQuraa	I'll assume he's around the same age.    The problem is that guys like the status quo.  If nothing changes, you'll slowly start to resent his not asking.  At the same time, you shouldn't rush him either.  In the end, it all boils down to an incompatibility in your relationship with him, a BIG one.    He may not be the one.  Speaking for myself, I love my GF and talk about marrying her often.  We aren't engaged yet, but she knows I'll want to ask eventually, and I know she'll say yes when I do.    So, it's tough to gauge where you are because you just say that he says, "I'm not ready."  Does he dismiss the entire topic with that, or does he actively talk about marrying you, just later, because of money, career, or something like that?  If he is completely avoiding the topic every time it comes up, I would say that he's doesn't want to marry you.
B6CKyzngaa	Dependency is crippling your ability to function in the world, in your marriage relationship, and is crippling you emotionally. It is my hope that your husband is a caring one and simply has no idea how you feel inside being so dependent on him and that feeling is holding you back from feeling equal with him.  Your marriage is supposed to be all about your EQUALITY with one another as partners in the first place.    And.............you can never be fully functional in life and equal without some basic skills in life that pulls you up to typical level of adult abilities such as having a Driver's License.  Being able to drive is as basic a life skill as knowing how to read.  You cannot possibly understand or feel strong and confident in life without basic living skills.    I like the first poster's advice very much but my very first step would be   1) Talk to your husband about this, then   2) Enroll in a local Driver's Training; every community has businesses that do that.  Call and find out the price and duration of the course. It doesn't take long to get enough instruction and hours on the road to enable you to get your Driver's License. Truly you MUST get a Driver's License in today's society, it is equally as crippling not to be able to drive as it is not to be able to read and write. It is basic to today's society and it is crucial to how you function in life and your sense of well being, independence and self esteem. And someone who loves you wants those things for you, the things that make you feel better inside about yourself and helps you to stand up and function properly  in life instead of crippling you. 3) Make sure that both your husband's as well as your own name is on ALL your business in life.........checks, savings accts, charge cards, utilities, rent/car/etc.  This is important so that in life you (along with your husband) are establishing equal credit and identity in life for yourself.   4) Get a job for yourself where you can function as an individual and take pride in your day's work.  We all have a basic need to accomplish tasks and to contribute to the home and its needs.    The world is about you too, AS AN INDIVIDUAL, as well as your husband.  Start by talking to one another and helping him to understand how it feels to be unskilled, how unfair that is, how dependency feels and what a mess life can turn into for you should something happen to him.  If he loves you, he'll be very supportive and the two of you can begin seeing to your indpendence and security early on in your relationship. Step by step you can acquire the skills you need to be a better person and partner. And that, by the way, is the mark of a true partnership, one that sees to the well being of one another.|`|Jtd7kXQSaa	Simple get a job. When you have Job and are making money then you will not be so dependent on him for every thing. But on the other hand you 2 are married. That means you SHARE every thing. Just because he makes all the money does not mean that 1/2 of it is not yours.
caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	Pasta & Chicken are probably most affordable options for the dinner.  Next step: make it yourself or with the help of family.  Then just offer rolls, salad, and a simple veggie (mixed are great).  That will save you from having to hire a caterer which is much more expensive.    Hors D'ourves can be just cheese/crackers, veggie/dip and fruit.  You don't *have* to have hot hors d'ourves.    For alcohol, try just beer & wine.  Its way more affordable than a full bar.    I'm not far from DC and located in PA so my prices may only be a bit less expensive, I found a reception venue that is doing the hors d'ourves and dinner + full bar for $50 per plate (before tax & gratuity).|`|8g51eBf1aa	I'd say have a chicken, or a pasta dinner. These types of foods are less expensive. I'm having a host/cash bar for my reception. We're giving everyone up to 2 drinks, then it's a cash bar after that. (Like a ticket system.)|`|URyg465Eaa	Find a venue in which you can provide your own liquor.  If you can purchase your own liquor, you will save a lot on the wedding.  If you still need to cut back, it is better to cut back on guests then the quality of the food.  Also, Hors d'oeuvres are nice, but unnecessary.  I just had a cocktail hour for my wedding party not for all the guests.  If you must, stick with crudites and cheese, crackers, and fruit.  You don't want to fill them up before the main event.|`|f4c627930425c195d32f7d5a1017131aaa	Like others have suggested - have it in the afternoon when you don't have to provide a sit down dinner. My wedding is at 2pm with the reception immediately following (same location). We are only serving hors d'oeuvres. Examples: Chicken tenders, crab cakes, fruit, veggies, etc. (can't remember everything on the list). And I am not serving alcohol at my reception either. it's a waste of money. Serve champagne for the toast and that is it.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Based on what you say you want & the location, you should budget at least $200/guest for your wedding.    Check at http://www.theknot.com/?MsdVisit=1 for venues in your area.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	The least expensive way is to have the reception start around 2 PM and serve just cake and punch.    Otherwise, you need to call some caterers in your area and compare their prices. If you don't mind having a wedding without dancing, see what the cost would be to get a private room at a local restaurant (and YES, you must pay for your guests' meals). Or have your wedding in someone's backyard and prepare the food yourself.|`|7CKipTZOaa	Have all options vegetarian, meat tends to drive the prices up, there are many fancy salads and pastas that can be done without meat, and this caters to most people with allergies. As for alcohol limit the choices to beer/wine or champagne.    This in my opinion would be the least expensive way to have all that.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Pasta, garlic bread and Caesar salad from your local favorite Italian restuarant.|`|2d281c378a62cabf9789c151186cae74aa	If you work with your caterer or banquet facility they can give you options.  They have probably done a low cost alternative for other brides in the past.  Consider a daytime brunch or lunch as a lower cost alternative.  There is no requirement to serve a dinner.  You may just want to have a dessert reception with champagne and desserts or a cocktail reception with assorted stations of hors d'orurves and cocktails.  Some brides just have wine, beer, champagne and one signature cocktail to keep expenses down.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Buffet! I am feeding my guests for $12 per person.  Te EXACT same food we'd get for a sit down dinner, but 1/2 the price.  For booze: run a tab.  You ONLY pay for what people drink.  Don't get suckered into the "$20 per person open bar" things. at $3.50 per drink EVERY person would have to have nearly 6 drinks for you to break even. So go with a tab.    Good luck!|`|ACecbVghaa	You should make sure you get quality for your money, not just a low cost. You (or the hostess) are hosting and should want your guests to enjoy themselves. It's not all about the bottom line. If you can't feed them well, then cut down on the guests.|`|yXaob7wNaa	Get your family to cook and have a buffet.|`|JCAgvgTxaa	The fastest way to save is cut the guest list.    Another option? Have a mid-afternoon wedding . . . say 2 pm, with reception at 3 pm.  It is not necessary to provide an entire meal at 3 pm.  You can serve only cake and punch (or cake and champagne).    Another option?  Do it yourself with the help of family members.    http://lotsofinfo.tripod.com/weddinghelp...

After that, you start to really see who they are.  If this is his good part, I'd run.
qgpXxcuGaa	I'm in a relatively similar situation to you at the moment. The only way through it is to just keep going. It's hard, it's at points like this in life when you realise that no one ever really warned you about the amount of sh!t life manages to throw at you. The best advice I've been given is to try and focus on the good things to keep you happy, because if you go at things with a positive attitude it's a hell of a lot easier than if you're feeling vulnerable and miserable.    Have you told this guyfriend about your mum? If not he needs to know cos he can help you through it. I'm sure your mum will pull through, especially if she's had it before - she's strong, she can fight it. And if she can be strong you can too. It's one of the hardest things to deal with, someone close being that ill, but you just gotta be there for them and hope for the best, prepare for the worst.    Hope things get better for you - it'll be okay. :) x|`|AA11080047	sorry to hear about your mum. your bound to be having mood swings with your problems. explain to your boy friend you need support with all the trauma that your going through. take one day as a time and try and put your school problems behind you. good luck.|`|A5ZQmmW1aa	You need to talk to someone professionally about this.  You are worried about your mum and this is affecting your life outside home.  Does the school know what you are going through?  If they know, I am sure they will cut you some slack.  Talk to your mum as well and tell her you are there for her and want to help.  Tell the guy what you have told us -  that you are having a hard time and you are just lashing out but you want it to stop.  You don't have to feel like you are alone.  People will want to help.|`|8twsa18Iaa	1st peter 5 verse 7 "Cast all your cares upon him, for he cares for you."

iPNOVR6Gaa	You want to make love with and be partners with your son?  Creepy!|`|lgxE5nUoaa	This must be your first relationship with an older man.  Go for it.    I dated a lot of older men in my early 20s, most were anywhere from 7-20 years older then me and I really enjoyed it.  I'm now settled down and married and my husband is 8 years older.  It's great!|`|6EoAKcMwaa	Yeah. Why not? My current guy is 12 years older than I am (I am 40 BTW) and I date older men for a good reason. Most of them have a pretty good idea of what they want from life, and they tend to be more affectionate.     What have you got to lose? It seems you both already like each other, so why not try and see what happens?    Good luck|`|vsSuEtG1aa	Well if you were his mother in another life, I would def. not sleep with him in this one.  EWWWW....I loved this story until I got to that part.|`|Dh8i9msPaa	Take the risk.|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	Yes - go for it.    When I was 25 I worked with a woman (Sandra) who was 39.  We hit it off exactly like you described.    I had grown up in a very rural neighborhood where I was the youngest kid and all the rest were at least 8 years older than me.  I went thru phases when I was 8 that most kids didn't go thru until they were 16.  So I usually find people my age immature and boring.    But we worked together - our offices were side-by-side.  She was a widower with 4 kids.  I had never been married and had not dated much.    She was convinced that the way to live her life was not to remarry and not to get personally involved with men.  But we got along exactly like you describe.      I used to go into her office cube and give her neck rubs at break time - until one day she became red faced, her voice changed, and she told me "we should stop doing this".    We did.    From that point on, things changed and Sandra tried to set me up with a younger woman in the office.  This younger woman had no interest in me and I think she even hated my guts.    I resigned and moved on.  7 years later I met a woman and married her.    Now 22 years later, I'm retired and thinking back on my life with some.....regrets(?).  Have just realized that when I first saw the woman I married - she was wearing the outfit that was my favorite for Sandra to wear.  They have the same built, hair color and very similar backgrounds.  One I married (5 years older than me) was divorced and had 2 kids.    Sandra never re-married and never dated.  Now 70.  I'm 57.  But I have to wonder what a lonely life she has had.  Kids are one thing, but its not the same as having a partner to put your arms around.    I would make the argument that there is physical age and a mental/maturity age.  We differed in physical ages - but I think we matched well in the mental / maturity age.  After 22 years of marriage, I can say that with time the physical attraction becomes less and less important and the mental/maturity becomes of greater importance.  Maybe use this in a conversation with your friend and say something like "age is such a useless number"  or "as long as both parties are mentally compentent, and over the legal age, age doesn't really matter - does it?".    Good luck.  If you have found your soul mate, that's the most important thing.|`|xwsS0ITJaa	Yes as he will not make a slave out of you like the younger men do.|`|3IXj7jQNaa	go for it. my FIL and stepMIL are 15 years apart. they have been married for 27 years now. good luck!!!|`|MP4aWYIGaa	yes ..go ahead|`|GqTSa85daa	I once read Dear Abby, where many women wrote to tell her that they had married men 30 years older than them.  All were very happy with their choice.    Do what make you feel whole and happy, and to heck what people or society thinks...It's your life, not theirs.|`|LNSiLxlBaa	You are both adults and there is nothing wrong with your feelings. (Barring he isn't in a relationship otr married to someone else.) If you both seem to have this connection and he responds to you in a manner that makes you feel he is having the same feelings then I don't see why you shouldn't let him know how you feel. Good luck!|`|HL3APXLYaa	IT DOESNT HURT TO TRY. I THINK YOU SHOULD GO FOR IT. IF HE MAKES YOU HAPPY. IF IT'S NOT HOW YOU EXPECTED IT TO BE, ITS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.
Yyt8ZjU2aa	Damn girl that sucks. I've been in a lot of situations like that so I totally know how much it hurts when a friend ditches you. This type of thing happens so much in high school. That's crazy that she went on a school trip and she suddenly became best friends with that other girl. I mean, it's okay that she made friends with the other girl, but I don't get why she suddenly started ignoring you. And also cuz you two were best friends for like three years.. that's a long time. She really sounds like a b*tch (to be totally honest with you.) It sounds like she totally cut you out of her life. She doesn't text you anymore or invite you to hang out. I'm really sorry.. I know that feeling when you feel like the outcast and like nobody cares about you. You don't deserve friends like that. That girl is really sketchy, I wouldn't trust her. Trust me, it's not worth crying about.. that other girl has the problem, not you. Focus on making new friends who aren't fake and who really appreciate you as a person. Friends that you can TRUST. Cuz you deserve way better than what that chick has to offer. Let her go screw herself, you're way above her level.     And btw, I agree with your parents, don't change schools. Running away from your problems will never work. Good luck
C51fLujQaa	Get him a hideous shirt and pretend to be sincere.

She uses anything just so she can gripe at me.  CRAZY!!!!!!!!  Although i bet i have some stories that would put her to shame.|`|AA11326460	thats mother-in-laws for ya.

Seriously- she needs to realize that maybe YOUR gift is the one of the most importance.|`|wwB3csfYaa	I think you need to deleate her texs as soon as you see their from her because it will just piss you off so much! I do that all the time!|`|XUSq0gHoaa	Yup totally agree!!!!|`|m93CHWaCaa	You could've asked her the same thing. She could've consulted with you too.|`|3573a51569f3aa6ee404d5c6cced2bcdaa	she still wants to be   1 in his life it sounds like to me-try to keep the peace|`|kTN1WGvFaa	i agree with another poster...she definatly wants to still be his number one girl.. she's just a little riled up...who told her about the other one? next time dont mention anything about presents.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	Yeah, she seems to be a bit on the psycho side. I probably would have driven her a little more crazy by not responding to her texts...
0bYcYz2jaa	Ask them where are they going from here?  What are your plans for the future?  No one can stay a kid forever and by 18 most are willing to at least go for the college experience, dorm living, or into the world on their own.  If it takes an extra year or two to get a plan going, then that's okay.  But, they really need to start learning how to make it on their own early, so charge them some rent, grocery money, bills.  Make them get a phone of their own, their own car or train/bus pass.  The world isn't going to take care of them, and you've done your duty to them already, so preparation is a great help.  Painful.  But a help.|`|0HUHHzIQaa	It all depends  on the situation...    I moved out at 18. Moved back in at 23, while going through a divorce... My parents are the one that invited me to come back, and at the moment (a year later), they do not want me to move back out!! I have a son, who they adore, so for right now this is the best solution    However, i'd say 21 is a good age to move out. It depends on how responsible they are, if they have a job, and how tired you are of them!|`|WOHc22Xiaa	I moved out at 17. depends on when your ready.|`|180db111cb7c264e5bd192d677bd9c1faa	Hi Man from Iowa.  This is a tough one considering today's economy.  You are technically no longer responsible for them at the age of 18.  The law says they are adults and they should be, with your good training, be capable of taking on adult responsibilities.  That's all well and good according to the law.      I would hesitate to kick them out just now, as we are going through a world of hurt with our nation's economic situation.  Provided they have really decent jobs making really good money in a position that won't be axed in the next few months, I'd say boot them out now.      Otherwise, if they're working shaky jobs with minor incomes, I might consider letting them stay, but making them pay their own freight; a minimal rent, their own food, insurance on their cars, etc.  I might do this if they are 18-21 or still in college.  I'd also make them start a savings account that they must deposit to each payday as a booty towards moving out.      As for telling them, perhaps a family meeting where you explain that it's time and why, and then give them a move out date of perhaps 30 to 60 days.      All in all, it's difficult to give a specific age, since circumstances play a factor.  If they're just getting under your skin and doing much of nothing, then kick them out today and tell them to go find some foster parents, lol.      Good luck.|`|BjtqWNt8aa	Charge them rent. Make them help pay for food, electricity. Make them clean up around the place unless they want to pay you or your wife to clean up after them. Charge them for laundry service unless they do their own laundry...make them buy their own laundry detergent...in other words don't let them live there for free. If they have to pay rent at your place and buy their own food, do their own laundry or pay to have it done, why should they stay when they can have the same thing if they had their own place without a  supervisor/overseer??? (you)
ClK9W8THaa	Well first of all that's not a question.. that's a statement.  It sounds like you are going through alot of emotions and hard times. Especially at such a  tender age of 21.   I can't imagine what could possibly happened in your life for you to feel this down and depress.  Your too young and your too beautiful to be in this condition. Yes you are right about one thing you mentioned.   No one on this earth is perfect.  But you must know that we are , our worst enemy. We will look in the mirror and find all kinds of things about ourselves , just to feel bad.  We will put ourselves down in a  heart beat. And it sounds like that is what you have done and still doing.   No one should validate you in any shape or form... Feeling good about yourself should come from within. You have to stop putting yourself down and start believing in you... God did........ he created you , be happy for your life... celebrate your life. Think about all the people that we pray for in this world.. think about all the people who can't walk, talk, open their mouths to eat, people who 's never had a anyone to love them, think about all the Foster children in this world who are abandon.  You have alot to be thankful for. Listen there are millions of  reasons why you should be grateful ...Stop looking at other people for the blame , stop pointing the finger at other people for why you are feeling sad.   Start taking the blame for yourself. Life isn't going to be easy all the time.  People are not always going to like you.  People are not always going to give you a break in life.. If you have problems , now at the age of 21 and don't know how to deal with society, how are you going to make it 5 years from now ? I am sure that you have family and friends who love you so much.  If you need to talk to someone about this, then talk to your Pastor, or a neighbor, family member , a friends parent .  Pick of the phone up and call a therapist and make a oppointment.  People do this all the time .  You don't have to be half crazy to talk with a therapist. If anyone out there needs someone to talk to.. that is what they are there for.  I believe that you just need  some time out  and you  need to build a support system around you so that people are there for you when you need them.  Maybe that's what happened in your life.. People were just not there. I think once you talk with someone who can listen to you, and help you get strong inside, build your self esteem and build your confidence.... you are going to be able to handle anything in life.... Because life isn't hard... it's what we make it out to be.... But you have to be strong in order to walk this world we live in ok.... Get yourself some help so that you  can hold your head up again and feel  good about yourself again... it can happen and it will. Good luck to you|`|MGvN5xrNaa	Nobody's perfect! Everyone makes mistakes and has some failures in life. That doesn't make you a loser--that just makes you normal:)    I would highly recommend reading the book: The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren.  It's an awesome book that helps you find your purpose in life. And, you have a purpose!     Also, I would visit: http://www.needhim.org/  Jesus gives hope to the ones who lost all hope, and joy to the depressed. He gives you hope and meaning in life! Try Jesus!    I also would be happy if you want to e-mail me and talk if you want:)|`|0udjgaoBaa	What makes you think you are a looser? Are you a bum on the street? You cant be because they dont have access to computers. You need to look at the brighter side of things. Hello no one is happy right now people are loosing their jobs and homes and dont have ways to feed their families. You need to worry about school because your grammar is off so that you can get a good job and start some happiness.|`|m3Y3KkRmaa	Aww I wish I could help :(!|`|claUGpVRaa	What has happened to make you feel so badly about yourself sweetie? Do you really feel that no-one cares about you? Have you been to the doctors? You really should, they can help you and it's nothing to be ashamed of. Please go and see your GP. The can make you see how much you have to offer, honestly. You are sooo young and have so much to live for.|`|88086b50130d5627fcba99a626b339e1aa	hmmm...nobody is perfect no matter how hard they try. 21 is still young and maybe you feel this way because of your outlook on life.     There is a good side to everything. Even a close one dies you can celebrate their life and how much you loved them instead of hating everyone and thinking why him or why me? You never know. There are people that understand or will at least try to. People do care, sometimes people care and you've never even talked to them they've just admired you from afar.     Open your eyes and you'll see the beauty in life, I promise you. It may get tough and sad at times but that's when you need to pull yourself together even more. When you're on the down you can only go up, think of it that way. What were you like as a kid? Didn't have a care in the world, huh? try to get that feeling back.     Smile at the stupidest things and eat lots of chocolate. watch some comedies, join a club. Branch out a bit more. Things will start going your way soon enough. There a billions of us on this earth so you're never alone.    Olli    x|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	Stop focussing on youreslf, and start thinking of others..

Maybe you should try telling the person who you're closest to how you feel every day. Act like you're fine and happy, because then your body automatically thinks that you are happy!    You're not a loser. Every day when you wake up you need to tell yourself that you are NOT a loser and NOTHING is going to work against you.    If you look at yourself in the mirror and insult yourself or complain about how you look, you have to give yourself 3 compliments straight afterwards, every time!    Do this for 30 days, and it'll become habit. Trust me, it will work.    Always look up.  x
9a113201d86e8aed8140ccb9621c3bd3aa	You should go and have fun!
kRrnVCACaa	You bet. You can't take care of everything by yourself. If it's just you and your daughter, he should understand and volunteer to help out once in a while. I just shoveled today, and it was horrible for me with such a small amount of snow. I can't imagine how hard it must be with that much snow. So, yes, ask him to help out. He really should do that much for his family.|`|f7e207bacb96e05453dd798123720f46aa	Only if you still have to have sex with him.  He has no obligation to you.|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	I think that every ex wife thinks the same way you are think or at least saying here.  Why not ask him if he could help you get a snow-blower and then the machine does all the work.  BTW, I don't think that anything dealing with your residents is his responsibility.  Good Luck|`|sCwe3rVNaa	Do what I do, get yourself a new husband!      But in answer to your question, that sounds good to me, but does that mean I have to wash his underwear still?|`|09Y8F6hQaa	I'm in Detroit, same deal here, but he never shoveled snow even when he lived here.  You know, buy a snow blower, its much easier, and you wont kill yourself.  I used mine, with my pink boots and white coat.  Sometimes, I wear my ipod and put a Monster drink in the snow, so when I'm done, its icy cold.  Do something to make it better for you.  Then, of course, there is the class of red wine when I'm done :)    I don't know about you, but I don't want my ex around me anymore, snow or no snow.  I joke with my kids that one day, I'm going to have the snow blower painted pink to feminize it!  Good luck!|`|AIkmlvu9aa	Women only want men for chores, then they wonder why they are alone.    Bet if you would have appreciated him more when he was there, he'd be doing all sorts of things for you.    Instead, you probably made plenty of jokes at his expense, nagged, never put out, and made his life a living hell - all for your amusement.    Now..... your alone and he is not.|`|gGCHYlxGaa	Sound like he made a great decision.  Why wont you leave and go to florida there is no snow their    Perhaps u need a new man    And start having sex with someone else|`|rE9UfNeEaa	If he does do it should come out of him, not cuz your nagging him to do it! Unfortunately it don't work that way that job don't belong to him no more. Maybe the children should take on a new task.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I have to admit, I'm always grateful when my husband goes outside and shovels the snow for us.  We have a long driveway and it takes a long time to do.     Considering he's an ex, I'd say he's not obligated to shovel - if he chooses to do so out of the kindness of his heart, that is very cool.  If not, why not get a snow blower?|`|4gZYucHMaa	lol    nice concept but i don't think it's going to happen    I hear you about the snow...another 30 cm forecasted today too :(|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	Should have considered his contributions to the home before you ran him off. Now you gotta pay someone else to do it.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	I think you should give him oral sex if he does.    Because you're providing child care, but there are so other jobs that he has to carry your weight now.    So, you want a strong, protective man to help you?    Better learn to be a sweet, generous woman.    And I'm very serious.    Good Luck!|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Not only shoveling the drive, but washing and servicing the car, mowing the lawn, especially while you and your new lover are sunning.  The list could go on and on.|`|JpuWdGLRaa	Yes. You know we live around that area. If you want we could come up... my dad is home today... and my husband and son, and my daughter's boyfriend........ do you want us to we don't mind we are bored lol!|`|W2R8TRDmaa	Do you go to his house and give him blow jobs?  Where would the madness end?|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	Life doesn't work that way.    I would say invest in a snow blower, or find a neighborhood kid to do it.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	That is no longer his job.    Hire someone.|`|RncUc0traa	yea dey should give more than money but also u have to remember he ain longer your husband|`|iZbgUtxcaa	That idea is completely absurd.     I love the oral sex comment though, a perfect depiction of how whack your theory is.|`|ZXhpEuGpaa	I think he should help you out with certain things,especially since you have a child together.|`|iQqsdl5yaa	Are you friggin kidding me...do it yourself...what did you do before you met him, did you shovel then?  Women like you make other women look bad and helpless....get off your a@@, stop complaining and shovel!|`|B1sT1t44aa	If he has visitation to see the kid's let him dig through the snow to get to them. You could always take him back to court and demand that he pay for a snow shoveling service to take care of this problem. In all sincerity though I understand how you must be feeling and I hope someday that you find a real decent man in your life that respects you and loves you with a true heart. I am struggling with the snow where I live to and summer cannot get here fast enough to suit me sweetie.Take care and keep all your family warm.
8tqQXcp4aa	I'm like that too, well my older sister is. She newly acquired a sidekick, and she won't let anyone touch it or she "will break their arm in two". LOL she's not selfish. She's just careful and mindful of the amount of money she doesn't want to spend replacing it.|`|HRJkHuw4aa	baby steps honey, do things you wouldnt normally do one day at a time. if someone wants to see your stuff then stand right there while they are looking at it, break your self in gradually. It will get easier, start off with people you really trust|`|CvkuzcpDaa	well...next time someone asks you...just say...im not trying to be mean, its not like i dont trust you..its just im REALLY protective over my things.....so do you mind if i say no...? xx but maybe learn to trust ppl..who had 2 bad experiences...but maybe other ppl wont be like that,,,xx:)
FqEk58u1aa	Its just a game that some girls play, usually when they are drunk. Its like tieing a cherry stem in your mouth or taking a body shot. It makes them feel wild, sexy, whatever - but since its just kissing and its not with a man, there's less guilt. Sometimes it leads to more but that is a different question altogether. You specifically said "make out". Rather it is harmless or cheating, depends on how you and your partner define monogamy. The details are different for different people.     I, personally, kissed a girl and I liked it. Here's a picture of her. That was one WILD friggin' night...lmfao...    http://www.funnyhub.com/pictures/img/sca...|`|vHwyBEggaa	It's okay???????|`|S8RL9lieaa	Sounds a bit odd, but whatever turns you on.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	If they're both ok with it than of course.|`|4XlWLeSsaa	HARMLESS FUN FOR SURE!!!!  see ya in hell jerk..P.H|`|iOI2RT6maa	It's up to your husband / boyfriend / significant other / significant other's significant other.    If my wife was making out with another girl, I'd call it cheating. =\|`|F6Zh3YzXaa	Ew. No it is NOT.
VxC09hX5aa	You know i feel sorry for you because i believe you have bent over backwards to be a good step mom to this child and that's probably the problem some women can't stand the thought of their kids loving their ex'es new wife, the exwife is jealous just like some of the exwives who answered this question     The child shows you no respect so until she does just stay clear of her be nice but don't go out of your way.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	It's not weird, but it's not helpful to the situation. Regardless of how the ex feels about you, it's not the daughter's fault. Want it or not, she IS a part of your family, and always will be. If you don't treat her as such, it's just not right.|`|d20mM90uaa	WEIRD, CHILDISH AND IMMATURE AS WELL  YOU ALL NEED TO GROW UP|`|u7f0QB37aa	No it's not unusual she's not your flesh and blood|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	is it her or her mum that you want to hurt .. just give the kid a hug she needs it from you show her some love please .. thanks .. she needs it now ..|`|rcut6bhoaa	I would move you out of the house myself.      Unfortunately,  you are only thinking of yourself here.      Think about how the child feels about this and how you treat her.      WOW,  you are unbelievable.|`|a8mQuc4iaa	its not un-normal but it is wrong, though its no just you. Its harder to bond with step children then with real children. but you do need to try, spend a little more time with her. Her mum only has this rants with you because she is threatened but she (your step daughter) does count as one of your kids so you should mention her when asked. i can understand fully why you act like you do and why your husband gets angry, but you need to pull it together and at least try to bond with her.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	Yes, you are a horrible person and it is weird and wrong what you do.  I am glad you aren't my stepmom.    EDIT: Are you KIDDING me with the thumbs down?  This woman has been in this child's life since the child was THREE MONTHS OLD!  Furthermore, she is making the CHILD suffer because of a bad relationship with the childs MOTHER.  In what way AT ALL is this a healthy, unselfish, motherly way to behave?  I feel TERRIBLE for this child to have to suffer such a stepmom.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	Wow, I feel really bad for your stepdaughter.  I think you are being horrible to her!  You are taking out the situation between your husband, ex, yourself out on her.  The poor girl didn't do anything.  How do you think she feels being left out all the time and being treated like the proverbial "red headed step child".  Shame on you!  You are the adult here.  Like it isn't bad enough that her parents aren't together, and now you are making her feel like she is complete burden and not part of your family unit at all.  You should know better!|`|aMZ7IKysaa	Its a bad situation, and totally not your responsibility, but regardless of the fact that you don't get along with her mother, I wouldn't put that on the child.  It isn't her fault her mom is a crazy ***** ya know?  I would at least show her that no matter what her parents are going through, she can still be comfortable with you.  Its important that if you have made it obvious you aren't going to act as a parent to her, that she absolutely understands that you are a friend.  Be an adult.|`|29I8PWrxaa	I don't think you are a horrible person, but I think you are making a mistake.  When you married this man, he already had a child - she came with him.  It's much easier to bond with a child as a stepmother when they are young as she was.  I can understand why it's difficult though with the mother acting the way she does with you.    I think you should try to bond with the girl.  Go to any events that her mother is not at - for example, her ball games, etc.  I wouldn't get a babysitter for her when you have a weekend alone with her.  And you should definitely talk about her when people ask about your children.  Just avoid the mother until she cools her jets.  Don't be the one to transport the girl back and forth between you and your husband's home and her mother's.  If you keep making an effort not to bond with her, your husband is going to continue to resent you, and your step daughter will too.      I would also do everything I can to convince the mother to be a mature adult and meet with you and your husband for coffee one day to talk about how to all raise this girl together. It's whats best for her - you should all be on the same page.  If you all don't do this, this poor girl is going to grow up to have some major issues ... just wait til she becomes a teenager!|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	While you may not be considered for a trophy, I don't think you are a "horrible person", either. You are simply human.    Everybody is different. Some people have more loving or more forgiving natures than others. If the girl's mother has been rude and a pain for years, nobody can really blame you for feeling the way you do. At least that is what I think.    As long as you are aware of this, and it doesn't cause too many problems in your household, I suppose it's OK. But maybe you could consider going to therapy or counseling so you can see if you can work on this. It's up to you, really.  Good luck.|`|gfHutvEFaa	If you and your husband got a divorce and someone treated your children like this, how would you feel about it? C'mon! You came on here looking for justification for your actions. You know it's wrong. Very wrong. It is in NO way that child's fault. Quite simply, you suck.    Who the hell cares if the ex rants and raves. WHO CARES! She does it cuzs she knows it drives you mad. Are you an adult or an idiot?     If she threatened you physically, GET A RESTRAINING ORDER! I did. Once my step daughters reached about 12 or 13 they KNEW who was always there for them. We were. They don't have much to do with their mother now that they are older.    Shame on you for treating your husbands flesh and blood like an inconvenience.    WOW! 8 THUMB DOWNS IN LESS THAN A MINUTE! CAN SOMEONE SAY "YEAH, I AM AN AWFUL PERSON WHO TREATS CHILDREN LIKE CRAP AND WANT TO FEEL JUSTIFIED IN MY ACTIONS SO IM GONNA PUT THUMBS DOWN TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO DONT AGREE WITH ME". UNREAL. LOL!|`|mCUNl9Wgaa	You knew what you were getting into when you married this guy. A family has to be blended to work. I think it's rude you exclude her. Who cares about the ex. So she makes life hell. Sometimes thats what an ex does. But you knew what you were getting into. My mother and step mother had a cordial "Hello Lisa," "Hello Linda," relationship because it made things run a lot smoother in our family. However, if you want to play wife to this man, you have to also partake in his responsibilities. Take his kid to the game. You take your own kids to the game. Their his flesh and blood too. Talk with the daughter. Have her understand that you're not trying to be her mother, tell her to leave the mother out of your relationship to her. Because you need to blend your family. I think you're rude to this girl and it's not fair. Her mom sounds nuts though, and for that I'm sorry.|`|CTc3ZUtNaa	I'm sorry, but you are actually going out of your way to drive a wedge between your step daughter and yourself.... which is going to lead to a huge wedge between you and your husband.   You are the adult here, his daughter has done NOTHING wrong. Don't take out the situation with the ex wife on the child... you need to TRY a little harder. It sounds as if you tried for a short while, it wasn't EASY, so you stopped, and now you're going out of your way to avoid admitting that she is a part of your life. Unfortunately, these situations are never easy, but you HAVE to keep trying. That little girl has done nothing except get born to a mother and father who weren't meant to be together.     If you care about your husband, you need to start trying A LOT harder. Because believe me, if it were between choosing you or choosing his daughter, most men would choose their daughter. Your immaturity in the situation is going to cause your husband to resent you. Be the bigger person, put on a smile, and start acting like a good Step MOTHER.... sounds like you are trying to be a Step Stranger / Acquaintance. Broken families are never easy, but you knew that when you married a man with an ex wife and a child.|`|zTQVC7GBaa	I didnt read all that but u r wrong.Treat her like ur kids period!|`|5ViTUTyZaa	I do think that is horrible.  Having kids is very hard.  Do you have your own children?   If you do, you realize the you don't always WANT to do the things you have to, you even go through times when you love but don't LIKE your child, etc...but you do it anyways, that is being a parent.  No matter what is in your way you at a minimum do what you gotta do.    If my husband treated my son that way we would not last very long.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	They are a package deal - if you can't cope you may as well divorce him now.  I don't blame your husband for being pissed off.  I think the best thing for all of you - if you want to salvage things - is some family therapy.|`|AA11328507	Just because her mother is an azzz, you shouldn't act like one.  I could understand it more if you said that she was disrespectful to you, but you didn't state that.  You need to let this child know who you are and not have her believe any of the BS her mother may be putting in her head.  Chastise your hubby for not backing you and ALWAYS stand up to the mother and anyone else who tries to disrespect you.      Your giving up opportunities to get to know what is possibly a great kid NOT to mention she is the older sibling of your kids.  I think you should make the effort to be her step mom.  There is no way your hubby should need a sitter for his child when you could  easily do it.|`|vLgbjmI2aa	Well i dont want to say you are a horrible person but i would have to say its pretty horrible that you dont want a relationship with this young girl who is your step daughter??I am pretty sure you dont treat your own children like this.Believe me i know its not easy.Living in a blended family never is but you have to make it work for sake of all the children.Think how your stepdaughter must feel when you are with your kids but want nothing to do with her.Think about the damage you can cause this young girl by making her feel unwanted and unloved.My husbands ex and i arent exactly the best of friends but we have to get along for the children and its best that way.You need to figure something out and make the relationship work.I have 3 children of my own and 3 stepchildren and let me tell you they have been in my life since they were little and never once  have i  not wanted to be with them.Of course its causing a strain on your marriage.Your husband should not have a wife that doesnt want anything to do with his daughter.I know that if that was the case with my husband i would leave him because it couldnt work if he didnt love and accept my children.You say you tried when she was a baby and now you are giving up because her mother interferes.Thats not right.You should try your hardest to make it work for that little girl and for your husband.If you really love your husband you will figure something out because if you dont you may lose him.|`|1ERDjrTTaa	The point is she is a an innocent child. It does not matter what her mother has done to interfere the child has nothing to do with that, and you are taking it out on her. She probably feels so insecure and like such an outsider when she comes over for visitation. The child is probably going to believe all the bad things her mom has said about you now, since you are acting this way. You knew your husband had her when you met and married him, its kind of like a package deal. You cant change your mind like that.|`|lj2tpz46aa	in the end its all about your kids hun you have to do whats right for themand if he isnt backing you why are you with him
iwjxi562aa	it's called competition....it is healthy|`|dnGJ5JLgaa	It is called live with it!  It is part of life!    And sometimes you are not always!!!  if this has anything to do with the PEN!  OMG!!    IT"S A PEN!

f9crUDTwaa	Grow up ..  get control of yourself . Do you plan on being at the mercy of every good looking woman for the rest of your life? Pathetic , just pathetic.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	I think you've assessed the situation very correctly.  She enjoys teasing you and getting a reaction out of you.  So quit giving her those reactions and she'll back off.  How?  You need to think about what she's like underneath all the boobs and smokin' curves.  She's probably either very self-centered or has horrible self-esteem so she has to constantly prove herself.  And the fact that she tries to come on to a guy with a girlfriend proves she has no morals or respect.  Wouldn't you get angry if there was a guy at your girlfriend's work who tried to seduce her?  Seeming a little less attractive now?  In other words, visualize the whole person, not just something you want to screw, and maybe you won't get so hot and bothered next time she comes around.  Get a spine.    EDIT:  Apple Krak, thank you for that.  I wish all men were like you.|`|XUSq0gHoaa	Well fist of all you have to be honest with yourself! Do you really love your girfriend? If the answer is yes then AVOID this co-worker of yours. PERIOD!!! and whene she says the little comment of "it's too bad you have a girfriend" tell her "no, it actually not bad at all because we love each other very much and she is perfect"! then just smile away! Now, if you don't have feeling that strong for your gf then talk to her tell her you need time because you are confused (more than likely she won't ever go back to you, so it's your risk) then try to give it a chance with this other co-worker of yours.     Thing is though that once you have this co-worker and sleep with her you will want to be with your gf again.|`|yyDvNEJ8aa	Try to stop.  Theirs really nothing you can do about it.  Cant tell her to dress differently, and you cant continue to be like that.  You already have a girlfriend which you can look at like that.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	Here's what I do when I am in similar situations. I have a little talk with myself. I acknowledge that I could (if I wanted to) rock this girl's world and do so without my wife finding out. Then I applaud myself for being such a wonderful guy because I can turn down the hot stuff by choice. I really do not want to cheat, and I really do not want to be intimately involved with anyone I work with even if I was single. I pride myself in being a professional and make sure to treat the hot chicks as professionally as I treat the ugly ones. Did your wife marry a weak man or a strong man? I believe my wife married a strong man, and I'm going to prove it to be true even if situations become very tempting.|`|onbwN4csaa	It's what all guys would like in the office. But she by the distraction.  and Sexual innuendos . keep you from doing you job. the way you do it to your best. Talk to the boss. ask if there's a dress code for the company. ask if they enforce it. Now tell them the problem.   You have to understand she's trying to get to the top. You can't blame her for that.  But if a guy walked around with there zipper open.  the boss would screw us. Should be the same for the girl. No.  Talk to management.    You have to admit it she knows how the use it.|`|1tdOW2Pfaa	"Here's the rub."      Nice "Freudian Slip", Azzclown......        8 Ball SENT ME|`|AA10348638	I absolutely hate women like this..although I use to be one..I wasn't happy at home so I wore provocative clothing..and was the one starving for attention..but now I am happily married and it bothers me that my husband has a woman like this that he works with..I know because I have seen her when  I visit him at work and although he says that "he has nothing to do with her" he has to for his job..Also when I was at his work and she didn't see me she was giving him a look where she turned all the way around to look at him..She didn't know I was there..I have told my husband that women will do anything to get attention and have tried to warn him..but he just tells me not to worry...But women remember "What comes around..Goes around"  Karma is a *****!!  And if you mess with my man I will beat your a**!!|`|tdulyzXXaa	Take a walk to ease the pressure. When you come back, she won't look that attractive anymore.|`|5d92d4d47a0206e6c5d7d342e7d48e8eaa	Haven't you ever heard of sexual harassment?  As someone else said "Talk to the boss. ask if there's a dress code for the company. ask if they enforce it." Her saying to you "It's too bad you have a girlfriend."  has nothing to do with work. Thats her trying to work on YOU. And thats not cool at all, and doesn't contribute to a healthy work environment.
W5wCArLqaa	close the bedroom door, turn on the light music and have lots and lots of sex|`|pnxzK1nhaa	You shouldn't have a pit if you are going to allow it to run your life.You have to show the dog who is boss or that pit will run all over you.Pits are very dominant and need an alpha to show them the way or they automatically assume their place as alpha AND who do you think will be displaced??There isn't room in the family for 2 females and one will have to overrule the other...Sure that dog is cute now, but she will get big and she will need to fear you.I have a male pit and i learned that the hard way.I used to always let him on the bed with me and my bf hated that so he would push him off, well one day he growled at my bf.Crap changed fast!Now the pit knows who is boss.    This is how big that adorable lil mutt is gonna get in the next year and you don't want trouble.http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b136/s...|`|bO2rzfISaa	Buy the dog a crate (and read up on crate training; it's really important) then you can put the crate wherever you want during sex.

No dogs on the bed or furniture and unless it can lie there quietly on the floor while your getting banged then its off to the kitchen or cellar for Rover.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	how about putting the dog in another room while you have sex?|`|UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.    However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.    My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com    What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.      Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|ImeMT0Zlaa	By a bed for the dog and kick it out of your bedroom....|`|2b4OFx5Oaa	The issue is 100% mental.

xGshAiXOaa	I would bring it all out in to the open.  Let him know that you've checked his e-mails, he's scum.  Tell him that you feel betrayed because he knew that you did not trust in his relationship with this ex, and the only reason you two got back together was because he promised to end communications with her.  He is doing something that he knows that you would not approve of.  Unless you want this sort of behavior to continue, you need to let him know that he's not that sneaky, that you know what he is doing, and that it WILL NOT be tolerated.  Make sure he knows the damaging effects this has on your trust in him, and that he will have a long way to go to earn it back.  Do not let him turn anything around on you, so what if you checked his e-mails, he shouldn't have had anything to hide from you.  Make him choose, once and for all - it's either his ex-girlfriend or his WIFE.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Well, I would not have married him in the first place - I can assure you of that.  I think he still have feelings for this ex as she does for him.  I think I would end the relationship entirely, divorce him and let them be together - not because they've won and you've lost, but because they're both jerks and they deserve each other.  You deserve someone better.  Move on!|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	I would handle it by packing my stuff, finding a place to live and filing for divorce. The ex is not the problem here - the husband is. For him to go to such great lengths to keep in touch with the person he knows you detest is a slap in the face, and personally I would not put up with such a disrespectful man any longer. He may have fooled you once - shame on him; but if you let him fool you twice - shame on you.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	Okay, I will start with one of my common phrases:  You don't have an ex problem, you have a husband problem.    It is his job to draw the lines with other people, and rather than you asking why she won't leave, ask why he won't make her go away.  She is either being encouraged or she is a stalker, and honey there are solutions to both of those issues.  I think you know the first course of action, and it isn't to call the police for a restraining order.|`|f6YsGOynaa	He's a liar and can't be trusted.  You already laid down the rules and he broke them.  So you're going to continue to let him violate your boundaries?  You basically just invalidated yourself by continuing in a relationship where he knowingly broke the ONE thing you said would violate your trust.  Stew on that a while and see what you think.|`|vYt7LWTvaa	See me I want my husband to leave so I would make an huge argument about it and tell him to get his white trash ex girlfriend and they can be together and he will have to pay child support.     But if you want your marriage to work. I would tell him look. I checked your email just for the heck of it and I found out you have an my space page that only has your ex girlfriend on it. What is up with that? I love you and am afraid that if you don't cease this communication with her our marriage is Over! If you change the password on your email account I will assume you are cheating and leave you because you are suppose to forsake all others that is what you said when you married me!|`|nO2vflnPaa	It's obvious that he is still chatting with her behind your back and is not loyal to you nor is he respecting your wishes. She is never going to go away if your man continues to talk to her and updating her on what the two of you are doing. Chances are, that this will continue until a confrontation takes place between the 3 of you. You need to get them both in the same room and ask him what the hell is going on and why they are still talking! If she is worth jeopardizing the relationship then they deserve each other. You cannot over look this. And if they are only friends, then why did you have to find out about them talking again by snooping? And by the way....I don't think anything is wrong with snooping. If you had not snooped, you would still be in the dark about all of this. I think it's just cruddy the way they are sneaking around and talking still. It makes you look stupid to the other woman. And it gives her the upper hand. If he strives to make her happy by betraying you then he needs to go on and live his life making her happy so you can then pursue happiness as well....Don't let them do this to you...      OMG! If he picked you up, and locked you out of the room.....COME ON!!! You know he is guilty as sin girlfriend! I'm sooooooooooo sorry for this but if you stay with him, then you are really degrading your self and setting and accepting the lowest of standards! Please...... Set the bar a little higher, Pack up your things (if your not snowed in) and leave him! Never return! Sure you 2 can always be "friends" If he feels like he has to hide some skanky chic from you then you can be sure that he is just as skanky.... I'm sorry, but if you stay, then you really need some help with re-boosting your self-esteem. Do not let this go! I'm sorry..|`|3573a51569f3aa6ee404d5c6cced2bcdaa	maybe you should calmly ask him why he broke his promise|`|a83f9bae7d1d62130946ee3f2da9490baa	Maybe he just enjoys her company.  Maybe she's really a great woman to have as a friend.  I have a girlfriend but have plenty of female friends that I'll just hang out with or go to the movies with.  My girlfriend doesn't really care at all.  She's awesome.|`|J3erdQCIaa	Well I guess I'm the jealous type so I would be furious.  Not cause of what he's doing, but for the fact that he never told me about it, it would make me think he's hiding something.  Suspicious right?  Well I would demand an explanation, with a justification of "she's come between us before"....  Good Luck!!!!|`|fudPrZTyaa	Yep, it smells fishy. I would be very upset as well to say the least. There is certainly an issue of trust there. Also he needs to be more honest with you. He might just be enjoying the attention he's getting from the ex. But he should be happy enough with the attention from you. He has chosen you, so he should be content with you only. Well, to be honest with you, I'm not in your shoes, so it's hard to say what you should or not do. The only thing I would suggest is that you keep your cool (yes, it's hard) and your dignity. Stop messaging her. I think you could act quietly. Because every time you tell him something, he turns around and gets another way to get around you. So pretend you know nothing. Continue your investigations. Use condoms. I know this is a terrible feeling/situation. But you gotta be smarter than this girl, and your husband. I wish you all the best!!|`|eQPy6KP2aa	I would be pissed, obviously his intentions aren't good and If he gets mad about you snooping then it's only because he has something to hide. Every move he made while setting up that account was made with the intention of deceiving you and doing something he knew you would have a problem with. I would definitely confront him.     Let her have him, if this is the kind of person he is then not only does someone like her deserve him but in the end the joke will be on both of them. Sorry, I know there are no easy answers where the heart is involved.|`|CGt4CKPfaa	he and you need to completely stop talking to her.  COMPLETELY.  I dont know why he is contiuing to do this... I would be suspcious|`|dTaGzh6Haa	His secret facebook account has me worried. You guys are married, not dating--big difference.  Are you seeing other red flags? Coming home late, little lies and excuses, more sex, less sex, etc?  Secret emails and other web related stuff are one of many signs that something is going on. Sorry.|`|1tdOW2Pfaa	I would be PISSED BEYOND imagining!    I got ticked off just reading this!            8 Ball SENT ME|`|VfuCXCRAaa	how long have you guys been married?      what are the emails between them about?  are they sexual in nature or are they friendly?    it all depends on alot of variables in this situation on how I would react|`|qfbf0ZhNaa	You have the right to be angry, definitely at the ex.  But sometimes the problem isn't the ex...it's the guy.  Your husband obviously doesn't respect your feelings on this, and you should understand why.  Try relaxing and taking a break from being angry, maybe go to counseling together and see if he still has feelings for her or if there's something he gets from her that he doesn't get from you.  He could feel smothered and need more space.  Or it could be as simple as he's introverted and he doesn't know how to deal with your extrovertedness, so he sneaks around for his own internal energy.  Either way, if he feels like he has to keep secrets from you there's an issue that the both of you should deal with, his ex is just a convenient excuse for the both of you.|`|sCwe3rVNaa	I think it is disrespectful of a person to have "secret" communication with an ex, or even a person of the opposite sex.  Without trust and respect, I don't think there's much of a marriage.  As far as reacting specifically to your husband, I think you will have to fess up about the snooping because otherwise how can you call him out on something you aren't supposed to know?  Obviously you can't just live with this situation.  Someone that makes you uncomfortable shouldn't be in his circle of friends if he values your marriage.  Even if her interest is just just about making him feel special and he has no desire to cheat or anything, it's still not right.  It's all about priorities, and keeping her as his little secret friend when he's well aware of your feelings isn't showing me that you are his priority.  Good luck.  .|`|AA10377289	yea, maybe your husband is just really friends with her. but then again, lying about the facebook stuff is something you should be worried about. or maybe he needs space from you? you think? i think you guys need to have your own lives besides your married lives. of course what i mean by that is to just hang out with your friends. like you go shopping or whatever you guys do, and him watch football with the boys or pool. Try to give him space. and checking his email? what are you email police? give him privacy.|`|AA11326460	I would be upset.  But I don't think I would have married someone who I didnt trust around their ex.    It's not right for this girl to keep on texting and e-mailing him but he has a part in this too.  why isnt he telling her to go F***  her self that he is in love and she is in the way of being happy.|`|49We7buoaa	I would be enraged at him.... Who knows what their intentions were, I don't think EX's should talk at all why did you brake up if yall needed to be friends, she is obviously important to him or he would have blown her off along time ago!!!!     it would continue to bother me also, your his wife he needs respect you, it shouldn't matter if you guys had a fight or not.    I wouldn't know what to do other than I'd completely ignore my husband until I had confidence that he was not talking with her any more.
GdV0q2J1aa	Omg! First don't be agressive about it. Get her something and with a note that says sorry and slip in her locker. It works trust me!|`|MhxyFcg2aa	If she cant trust you its never going to work out anyway :P|`|jj2tSASnaa	start hanging around with people who have the guts to talk to people they like without dragging you into it.  you might check your own guts out, cuz if you really like this friend then why did you not say hey I like u.forget about that other guy.  come on.
apzX48W4aa	That's really dumb to get mad over. Tell her it was just a joke and to stop being a brat and get over it. It may be special where you live, but to everyone else it sounds idiotic. I wouldn't even apologize for that its so dumb. Sorry not trying to be mean, but this is what everyone is thinking that's reading that.|`|pFoH0faVaa	just say sorry and if she is a true frend then she will forgive you in time|`|IQfaj1BGaa	omg woww all that for a coat?!?!  i really dont see a big problem about that    just tell her that we stole your bf's coat as a joke :]
fJ7E43kWaa	Don't even acknowledge it, or she's winning the battle.
Bc4udMhUaa	Ha, this might not be the best answer, as I too am in the same position. But every now and then I just go out. Sure I tell my husband, but it's not a question. It's I am doing this. Let the laundry and dishes slip a little. If you kids are old enough, maybe have them take on some chores.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	I let my husband know I need some time for myself and he takes care of the kids and let me do as I please.|`|FaMAaWYtaa	I just explain to my husband that I'm overwhelmed and burning out and say I'd appreciate it if he did x, y, and z.  Then I'd make a chore wheel for the kids.  Then I'd put a comfy chair in my room and close the door for an hour every other day to just be on my own with a book or movie or whatever.|`|YW74O9aNaa	I like the timing plan one answer gave :)    Planning always saves a LOT of time.     I do grocery shopping once in a couple of weeks. I plan the meals buy whatever is required for next two weeks. During the weekend when i have more time available i do some prep work beforehand like chopping veggies.    My husband does the laundry.. a weekly job for him :) we don't do it everyday..     Set a sleep routine for kids so you get at least an hour before ur bedtime ad stick to this routine.|`|7kOba3H0aa	make a plan.have the kids do some chores it show discipline. My eight year old sweeps picks up her room and cleans cat litter and feeds her cat. My teenager.washes the dishes most of the time. mops and he takes the garbage out. plus they pick one day out of the weekend and cook me and my spouse breakfast. as for us we handle the rest. laundry cooking and of course providing for the household.I Also have a 1 year old she puts her diapers in the trash. That helps.lol.... she is cute. I'm also 6 month pregnant. When you have a big family like mines every bit helps.Just to let you know the kids small chore do not affect them in school. My high schooler is an honor role student from day one. and as for the young ones they are just fine.Sometimes they don't do it right.But they know what to do to keep the house going.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	its easy make a plan and stick to it .. as in 10 min , per bedroom... 20 min cleaning .. 15 min getting ready for shops ... just like that .. dont go over time with things ..

ja0qW30Maa	Block your friend. I am SURE she will understand. I've been through this before. Is your mom annoyed? If she is then maybe she can tell your friends mom to get lost and get a life. Don't tell her yourself though. lol.|`|q2cRdOV6aa	You should talk to your mom and tell her that you are trustworthy and that next time when she calls your mom, she should politely tell her that she trusts you and no longer wants calls about what you write on facebook.|`|mFjTYaW1aa	first: talk to your mom.

bO2rzfISaa	Your daughter sounds deeply disturbed and you seem very casual about it. Your wife is right.She has made two attempts to murder your children. Does that put it in perspective? She sounds more like a sociopath than a depressed child.    That doesn't mean she doesn't deserve your love, but your other children deserve to live, too. Take her to a hotel in the area with a pool (make it a fun treat) and meet your new wife and children for lunch or trips to the mall. DO NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF OF THIS CHILD.    I'm not judging. I have a seriously mentally ill child myself.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	Your wife has every right to be worried. Whether or not your daughter was depressed or was strongly influenced by her mother, she should have the capability to discern that killing someone is bad. You do need to maintain a relationship with your daughter and see her as often as possible (especially if you want to help her get better), but I would take EVERY precaution around you children. Put locks on HER door, not your children's rooms. She should NEVER, EVER be alone with them even for a moment. Keep in mind that if she tried to kill your child by choking him, she may try to harm him in other ways, such as slipping something toxic into his food or drink. You never know what her mother may be telling her to do this time. I would also look into having her removed from her mothers care if she is influencing her that way.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	do you want a dead 2 year old?  invite her over then.|`|I814g6ZBaa	Your wife has EVERY RIGHT to worry about the safety of her child, especially with what has already happened.   Sorry, she wins this argument.  Find another way to work it out.|`|7104830b8607f6ce5847df469ca6a8c2aa	Sounds like you need to be in counseling with your daughter and no, I think your wife is being perfectly reasonable.|`|4o3jXz3Waa	No, I don't think she is excessively worried.  In this situation, the risk involved is MUCH GREATER than the reward.....your child's life for a visit with your daughter.  I am sorry that this makes it difficult for you to see your daughter, but even if nothing bad happened while your 11 year old was there, your wife would be totally insane by the end of that two weeks from all the constant worry that having your daughter there would bring.  Truthfully, I don't think you are worried enough.|`|RncUc0traa	two weeks HELL NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!|`|GLKD89wnaa	No you are the one who doesn't  make no sense. There is no way I would let somone like that be near my child.|`|cDRXtuJCaa	If this is just a joke and your trying to be funny your real sick but if this really happen i think you should take your oldest kid to a hotel or motel and spend quality time, and maybe you wife and younger child could meet up for Luch and things for short periods of time  It awfull to think kids are being screwed up by parents|`|CCYWYk3qaa	If i were 11yrs old and choked a kid my dad would have giving me a reaaaaaaaally big spanking to where I would know not to ever do that again. If i were your wife i'd be scared too. Its the mother-part-of-her she has to do what she can to protect the 'baby'. And 11yrs old on depression medication? WoW thats young. Instead of her coming over 2 weeks maybe just do a few days of it. Friday-Sunday kind of thing. If things go well during those few days then maybe lengthen her trip at your place. During those few days if your wife sees things are going well then I think she would be able to lighten up a little more. The kid is probably depressed cuz she has one parent telling her to choke a kid then has her daddy's wife not wanting her over b/c of it..Ur daughter is probably feeling very unloved and unsure about herself. Spend some one on one time with her and have u and the ex come to neutral terms......just think if she would've killed the baby she'd have a criminal record at 11 yrs old!|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Wow. You are in a tough position, here.  I understand your reasons for wanting to be there for your 11 year old, but I also understand your wife's concern for the baby.  And with the distance between you, it makes it even tougher.  However, it is also REALLY really creepy that your ex would tell anybody, let alone your daughter, to kill anybody, let alone a baby.  Two weeks is a long time.  I think if I were your wife, I wouldn't feel comfortable having her there unless someone were monitoring the baby at all times - and that is a horrible position to put her in, I'm afraid (I mean, she's got to go to the bathroom! )   I don't think that she is wrong, overall.|`|5ViTUTyZaa	Ask her what she would do if it were her own daughter w/ these issues.  Would she not see her child or not let her child in the house?|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	Frankly, I do not think that your wife is worried at all, I think you should be the one worried.  It is one thing to want all of your children to know and love each other and it is another thing to find your oldest daughter just killed your youngest.  Lesson to your wife and keep your oldest out of your house except for short visits.|`|fIeLH6HPaa	I would worry if I was your wife also. I also feel your ex-wife should be in therapy as well. Come on she put her own daughter up to murder an infant. She cant be right in her head. Your a lucky man, your new wife could wat to leave you just because of you daughter and ex-wife.|`|6BffDmjsaa	this isnt about ur wife now or about the bay, this is about ur daughter who's jacked up cuz u n ur ex didnt work things out. wat makes u think da meds are going to help her? pills are making things worse, y dont u just spend more time with ur daughter n show her how much u care for her? u better make peace with ur ex no matter what happend cuz she might be tellin ur daughter things ethier way da problem is with ur daughter, stop sending her to other ppl for helpl(therapists), she needs U GUYZ n u guyz are pushin her away|`|G8Wsmbogaa	I have to agree with your wife. It is absolutely horrifying to think that something like that can repeat itself. Your wife is not overreacting, she is just protecting your child. I think its best if you were the one visiting your daughter and not the other way around.|`|yMEfqtXtaa	I THINK YOU SHOULD NOT BRING YOUR DAUGHTER. THATS A LITTLE SCARRY.....................................  2115012310|`|sCwe3rVNaa	Your wife is completely reasonable.  Aren't you fearful of your daughter going through with her threat?  You want to put a lock on your child's bedroom door at night to resolve this?  That is madness, but if anyone were to be "locked in" I think the 11 yr old should be the one in a locked room.  Think about this from outside your world.  A nine year old child was told by her mother to choke an infant AND SHE DID IT!  So many problems with this situation.  Why is your daughter living with her obviously insane mother?  I have an 8 year old and I KNOW he wouldn't do something like that even if I told him to because he knows right from wrong.  You're going to have way bigger problems from that kid down the road.    You need to visit your daughter at her home, she obviously has serious issues and your wife and child shouldn't be exposed to them.    (Is this for real?)
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Whenever I would fight with my mother I would always write her a letter telling her how I feel. It seemed to help because I could get all of my feelings out without her interrupting me or yelling at me. Just write them a letter explaining to them how you feel. Tell them that you're an adult and would like to be treated like one and if things aren't going to change then you're going to have to move out. Tell them that you love them and don't want to fight with them anymore. Hope I helped!|`|828e8681c299a009930f6174f5138b49aa	If you are really an "adult & capable of making your own decisions", then surely you can cover the cost of living in an adult world and paying for living expenses such as food, utilities, rent and college tuition?    If yes, go for it.    How long do you think your boyfriend's family will tolerate you living  there? Or your friends (or friends' parents)? Just because they've extended an invititation does not make it a viable long-term solution. Will you really live there for three years?  Living with your grandparents could be an option, have they told you it's okay to live there for the next few years? Without conditions placed on your boyfriend?    Think carefully before jumping the gun.    BTW, your parents can make all the rules they want, their house, their terms.|`|VmPkgVPXaa	You are right you are old enough to make your own desicions. My sister is haveing the same problem. Its stressful and complicated. Although i am 16 i know alot about your situation. If it were ME i would bring it up in a calm atmosphere. You dont want to be arguing or when they are already upset about something. Calmly state that you are planning on moving out. Tell them what you are stressing out about. (all the stuff about how you are 19 and have a boyfriend who's family...all that).     Dont raise your voice even if they are making you angry because that will only start the fire. I would tell them that i am an adult and im glad you are concerned. You said you were smart and good at making your own desicsions. You tell them where you are going to be and what not. You are their daughter and they raised you like that. They raised you to be smart and make the right desisions. So they shouldnt have anything to worry about. And they just need to support you in whatever you choose to do. It seems they care ALOT! which is great but you need to tell them that you are an adult. And you need your space just like they need theirs. I hope this advice helps you. I wish you the best, good luck!|`|uGFzzLYWaa	As a parent, I can see their side. As a daughter, I can see yours.  I don't recommend moving out, the only concern they seem to have is for your safety, well being, and success.   If you moved out, you may damage your relationship with your parents, and your welcome may wear out at the places you are thinking of staying, and you may be forced to move back with your parents at the end of it all.|`|XuxZPdNdaa	First and foremost, make a list of pros and cons of living with your parents, than a list of living outside the house.     Things to know:  1. School tuition - how is this being paid, can you afford it?  2. Rent - just moving out to stay with another family will not give you independence, in fact, in most cases it's actually harder because you will need to adapt to the new rules...     If you really want to move out, the only way I personally would agree to it is if you can prove that you will be able to support yourself first!  Don't move out and than depend on someone else, another family to support you!|`|fIeLH6HPaa	Does your parents like your boyfriend? Could it be that your parents are worried that your grades will drop if you see more of your boyfriend? Try talking to your parents openly and open minded to find out what their reasons are. Maybe they have a good reason or maybe they don't. They could just be afraid of letting go of you. Do you  hav any other siblings at home or are you the last one/only one?Parents want the best for their kids and sometimes try to hang on for too long. You have to make a life on your own, in doing this you will make some mistakes along the way but that is how all of us learn in life. That can be hard for parents to deal with in the children. How long has this been going on with your parents? Have they always been strict on you? If not at what point did this change? Take a look at this and try to piece things together from there. Life is too short to be arguing with your family. I feel that this can be fixed with good open honest communication from all sides. Remember there is never a problem without at least two people involved and contributing to the problem no matter who it pertains to. Good luck. I know this can be resolved in  positive manner nd outcome.|`|8txWayVnaa	Sweetie, it comes down to dollars and sense.    If you can afford to continue your college education AND live on your own, then DO IT!  You seem to be very responsible.    I can tell you now that you will NOT be able to make your parents change.  They are probably afraid that you will wind up pregnant and will quit school by being so involved with your boyfriend--legitimate concerns on their part.    It is up to you to exercise the proper precautions so that you DON'T wind up with an unexpected/unwanted pregnancy.  If you can afford to live on your own--WITHOUT the help of your parents--then do it.|`|ClK9W8THaa	When you live with your parents you must listen to them. Whatever rules that they have you must obey them.  If your mom feels that you are not ready to move out , then that is her opinion.  If you give her reasons to believe that you are not mature enough, then she'll always think that about you. In order to get on your moms good side and have a mature relationship with your mom, you MUST act in a adult manner. Throwing tantrums , not speaking to her, slamming doors  will never get the respect that you want and it will delay any repair of your relationship with your mom.  If you want to be an adult, treated like an adult and be respected of any decisions that you may want to make, like an adult.. then you must act like an adult.    Adults don't always agree on things and they normally come to a agreement so that both parties are on the same page.  If you want to be with your boyfriend, you have to act like an adult. Respect whatever it is that she wants you to do. If you are ready to leave or move out then sit your mom down like an adult and talk to you about all the things that are important to you.  I am sure that she will see things abit differently, once she sees that you have shown yourself to be an adult.   I really think that you and your mom can resolve whatever issues that you have with one another... If your boyfriends mom is willing to allow you to move in with her... to me.. that saids she lacks responsibility as a parent and it saids alot about her own charactor.  I don't think she should  go against your mom and let you move in.. I think she should be encouraging you to talk things over with your mom. Strengthen your relationship with your mom and encourage you to maintain a good relationship with your mom.  I think that you really need to think everything through. have that talk with your mom and make sure that if you are still going to leave that you have a good understanding with your mom so that if things does'nt work out at your boyfriends moms house or your friends house that you can still come back home.  But let me tell you that theres no place you can live without having rules to live by. Life is never going to be easy all the time... Sometimes as an adult we have to live with pain in order to gain love... Theres nothing better than family, believe me.  And as you get older.. you'll find that the grass may not be greener on the other side of the fence. So take your time and try to make smart decisions in life...  Best of luck to you..

Focus on you. Be a self sufficient lady who doesn't need a man to get a long, enjoy your life and I good guy will walk into it at some point.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	If he saw you crying and he laughed...he is a bad man and he has a wicked and cruel heart.    Anyone who breaks up with another person should at least have the decency to not make them feel any worse.     He sounds like a selfish and immature man...who knows you love him. Too much for your own good, sorry to say. You sound like you are a codependant....and that is not good for you.    Please get some help -and do it soon! You are in a toxic and unhealthy relationship, and he is abusing you emotionally.     Understand that emotionally unhealthy relationships are addictive- like drugs. So you will need to be strong and you will need to be surrounded by people who love you and support you so you don't go back to him.  Good luck.|`|AA10034000	Move on....seriously. This guy is selfish and an idiot and he knows it. He just likes the thrill of someone loving him and breaking their heart. He seems childish. Move on and don't look back.

That really sucks....|`|AA11437439	it sounds like now that he has you where he wants you he is playing games with your emotions    i think as such tell him that because of the uncertainty that you do NOT want to live with that you have decided NOT to live with that uncertainty and are ending it    then put the phone down and change your number etc so that he knows you are serious    give yourself time to grieve, cry and scream, then rebuild your life without him     you will find in the long run that another man will appreciate what you have to offer far more than this manipulative, commitment-shy jerk (yes i know you have felines for him but he is still acting like a jerk)|`|x0pTYbdnaa	You should read this book called "He's just not that into you" by Greg Behrendt.|`|skWN7jWHaa	this guy is so not worth it.he can't even give you a reason why??? he laughs at you?? this should anger you,,,use the anger to say F*** him and move on sister! and consider yourself lucky your rid of him!

Plus, needs and outlooks change and evolve with age. So - every combination ends up being somewhat different. That said, these differences are subtle for me - nothing dramatic.

They met fall in love and got married and two months later he's off to Iraq.  They talked very frequently for the first 3 months of his tour and then it began to fizzle down to once a week if that.  She took a job at Golds Gym and worked out as well. This kept her mind busy and her health.      She finally got her a dog that kept her company at her apartment and that worked out real good.    I would talk to her on and off everytime she walked to get her mail from the box and asked her how the husband was doing.  She was not as happy so I suggested to her to take a trip to Florida...it's the beautiful Beach and you will be alright.I told her she needed to live a little and not get so tied up worrying about her husband.    She took my advice and came back with a sunburn...lol    Finally she gets good news her husband is coming home next month and she was so hysterical that I told her make sure you don't kill him because he hasn't had any sex for awhile, so break  him in gently and she laughed and gave me a hug. We actually became good friends though I never visited her in her apartment. We would talk at the mail boxes and that worked out just great.    Well, December comes along and she walks out to the mail box and I walked out and she was not smiling. I said what's wrong. She said the Army extended her husbands tour in Iraq 6 more months.    I hugged her and she cried and I said cheer up. You made it this far what's 6 more months right. So she smiled and I wiped her tears and the mail man talk to her too and told her keep your head up.    The New Year was on its' way and so I invited her to visit with me and my wife and enjoy New Years with us and so she did. We even had a treat for her Dog.    Now were in to the New Year with good hopes and blessings.  One day she comes over to our apartment and speaks with my wife. I was gone that day fishing. She said her husband will be home in next month. We were all happy for her and once again she was like a puppy jumping all over everybody.    She even kissed me on the cheek and said thanks so much for your support and I said like I say remember to go gentle with him. She said when her husband comes home she wants to introduce him to me.    I'm retired from Airforce by the way.    Anyhow, I walked out to check my mail and I seen a Military Car from Ft. Benning back up and leave from the parking lot in front of her apartment. I suspected the worse.    I ran up to her apartment and banged on the door and she opened the door and immediately grabbed me screaming and crying saying my husband is dead.    It was the second time in my life that I have had to hold a crying woman from tragedy. I cried with her and it was just horrible.    We gathered our composure and I told her pull yourself together you have alot to do. Contact family and such. She said she would get on it.    I hugged her one last time and said good bye.    They buried her husband in Florida where he was from.  She moved from the apartments and went back home.    Everybody can hear about the War in Iraq and talk about the War in Iraq, but when one of your close friends has lost a loved one because of the War...your attitude will change entirely.    This girl who I chose not to reveal her name for privacy reasons is the sweatest girl I've ever met. She didn't even have a chance to spend three months with her husband before he was off to Iraq.    18 months later..she is a Widow.    End of Story|`|OG4410bdaa	1. Please tell me in as much detail as you can what your normal day consist of:  Monday through Friday- always the same  my husband gets up around 5am to eat breakfast and get ready for work  I wake up shortly after, usually when he is in the shower, and I pack his lunch for work, then I go back to bed  He leaves around 6:30am, comes into the bedroom to kiss me goodbye before he goes  I wake up at 7:30am, walk the dog, then when I get back to the house around 8am I feed our pets breakfast  I eat breakfast, shower, and do a quick clean around the house, all done before 10am  My husband takes his lunch from 11:30am-1pm so about once every other week I'll go to base and eat lunch with him as a surprise  On the days that I don't go to base to eat lunch with him, I usually have at least one small errand I do around town just to get out of the house  My husband drives the car to work on base so I either walk or take the bus around town (if where I'm going is within 4 miles then I always walk, more than 4 then I'll probably take a city bus)  My usual errands consist of shopping for small household needs or running to the bank  I do however spend most of my day around the house cleaning, cooking (I love to cook new recipes all the time, meals from scratch can be very time consuming), I'm also in school (online college courses) so I spend at least 3 hours a day studying, I have several hobbies that I enjoy doing while my husband is at work (I love to sew and scrapbook so I do about an hour of that type of thing everyday to relax)  Besides my hobbies and my small errands, my husband and I have 5 pets which all require daily attention  One of our pets is a dog that I walk 3 times a day (7:30am, 12pm, and 4pm), each walk lasting anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour depending on where we go  At 5pm my husband comes home, I usually have dinner ready for us to eat together  We spend the rest of the night being lazy around the house: watching tv or talking about our days...we tend to talk to each other alot, maybe even too much, lol  Around 8pm we feed our pets dinner, and we'll walk the dog together for 30-40 minutes once he finishes dinner  We go to bed around 10pm most nights  On the weekends we enjoy hanging around the house together, going hiking in the area, going out to eat, volunteering at the Humane Society, etc...  My husband does a "guys night" from about 8pm to 1am with some of the other married army guys on Saturdays  There are some weekends that the army has training type stuff for him to do, and those are the weekends I may not see him at all...its hard when he works 5 days a week then has two or three weekends in a row of training but at least I get to see him after work, thats more than many others can say    2. What do you enjoy doing on Fort Cambell?  We are not based at Fort Cambell so I'm not sure what that base is like specifically  However the base that my husband is at is very small and there really is nothing to do on base  There's a small park for kids to play and a running track which I find boring in comparison to the running tracks off base  We live about 4 minutes away from base but the only time I ever go to base is for our weekly grocery shopping, or to surprise my husband with lunch at work    3. What do you enjoy doing off post?  I enjoy spending time with my husband, hiking, volunteering at the Humane Society  There's also a zoo in the area that I usually go to about once a month- I love animals and they have some lovely pathways to walk    4. What does your normal day consist of when your spouse in deployed?  Because of my husband's MOS, he isn't deployeed as often as most other MOS's are  I've been lucky so far that I've never had to go through a deployment, however I'm sure that in the next few years it will happen eventually    5. What does your support group of friends mean to you?  I don't really have alot of friends  I was born and raised about 20 hours away from where I live now, so I'm constantly on the phone with my two best friends and my sister back home, and they mean the world to me  However, I don't really get along with the other army wives in this area (they're all into doing their nails and I've never been the girly type... more interested in animal rights and getting good grades in school)    6. How did you feel when your spouse first deployed?  Like I said before, I've been lucky enough so far to have never had to go through a deployment  The longest my husband has ever had to leave me was for almost 6 weeks for an NCO type training course out of state, and I got to talk to him for about 5 minutes on the phone everyday    7. How did it feel the first time you heard from your spouse after they arrived overseas?  not applicable    8. What crossed your mind when you turned on the tv and saw that soldiers has been killed overseas?  I prayed that it was no one I or my husband knew, since the majority of my friends and his friends are all in the military    9. How often did you hear from your spouse?  not applicable, everyday    10. Do you work or are you a stay at home mom?  I am a stay at home wife, full-time college student, and mother-to-be (currently 38 weeks pregnant with our first child)    11. How hard was it to let them go back after their midway leave?  not applicable    12. What advice could you give a new army wife on what to expect for their life?  Being in the military is a hard job, its very stressful even in its day-to-day and as the wife you really have to show your husband 100% support in his career...it can be draining sometimes, and there are some days that you may really hate the army for taking him away from you, but remember its has its perks and he'll get out of the experience what he puts int
29I8PWrxaa	I've never been on the show, but I watch it.  I always wondered what the bride's got out of it.  I agree with the other post, that if you can afford to shop there then you probably don't need to be paid to go on the show ... but it doesn't seem right for the store to reap all the rewards of the show and not the other guests on it.  I mean, they couldn't have the show if women weren't on it trying on dresses!  They should at least offer you a discount on your dress.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	I've never done this, but I do have two points.    First, most of the brides live in New York City or just an easy drive from it - so they don't have to pay airfare, hotel, food, etc. Why should the show pay for a bunch of out-of-town guests when there are thousands of brides in New York?    Second, if a woman is buying something at Kleinfeld, one of the most upscale (perhaps the most upscale) bridal store in the country, paying for her own airfare is barely a drop in the bucket. Many of their dresses cost over $10,000.|`|0Id85yiYaa	that's crazy! what's the point of being on a show like that when you don't get any perks? i've seen the show and would have thought that they at least paid for the dress! i wouldn't do it. that sucks that they're making money off casting your show but giving nothing in return.|`|HLBdtP1Uaa	Never done that, but I LOVE the show.     My dream is to be able to " stroll in " and have my choice. Awww....to dream.    I wouldn't do it if I were you.|`|k6F9zkIRaa	Wow I think that's ridiculous. They should be paying for something as they will be making money off of you for going on their show. If you don't mind paying for all that then go for it. Personally I wouldn't because I think it's a rip off they should pay for at least your airfare and hotel room.|`|pMsMx817aa	i know you're going to hate my answer    but think about it... do you know how many girls would kill to be on that show?    they wont be disappointed if you say no.. theres another person to take your spot like that    they dont see the point in paying for anything, if you can afford to shop to at their store you should be able to afford airfare hotel etc [this is probaly what they think]    honestly? you should do it lol  thats once in a life time opportunity    good luck  ella            edit -- look then dont go!   why start drama over it?|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	I've never done anything like this.    However, I suspect many of the brides to be on the show have no problem paying for the expenses you mentioned.  When you can afford to stroll into Kleinfelds to get a dress, money generally isn't a problem--because their gowns are usually designer and higher end!    The only reason why someone would think to put themselves on a show like that is so that they can say they've been on TV and have that 15 minutes of fame.    EDIT:  Yes, Kleinfields advertize that their dresses start at $1500.  But lets get real...the majority of them are well over that.  And if you've ever purchased a bridal gown before, you know a huge profit is also made in the accessories that are a MUST to complete the look....and if anyone thinks those items aren't going to be over priced at this boutique, they are sorely mistaken.  Also to be taken into consideration is alterations, which, of course, Kleinfield would encourage their clientele to complete there...and again at high prices.|`|Pwybznsxaa	What do they offer you? Wow, they can at least give you a discount or pay for something!|`|2HKltfZAaa	I love that show.I completly agree with that it is crazy that they won't include hotel,airfare,food and a discount on the dress.But I haven't been on that show.|`|AA12378131	That is crazy.  I have watched the show before and I would never pay to be on it.  It is so overrated you can find a beautiful dress anywhere.    I bought my wedding dress at a local wedding store. It is raw silk and I got an amazing deal.  Save your cash!  :)|`|8g51eBf1aa	Sorry but I'm not surprised, their dresses start at $3,000 at least. Not everyone can afford that. So I wouldn't expect them to pay for anything or give a discount.
28WJwHf4aa	I love the second one the best! It is gorgeous! I don't think the beading is too much, esp. since you are the bride and should stand out. :-) But, if it is too much for your liking, they should be able to customize it to your liking.    I also really like the first one, but I think it needs a little punch of color so the detail isn't lost. Maybe since it's going to be custom made anyways, they could do a combination of the two dresses??    Congrats!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	go with the white one.  it is very elegant and the accessories don't get lost.  the orange one is definitely out- you're going to look back on your photos in ten years and say what was I thinking!  and the red and black one is cool looking, but not very elegant, more like a halloween costume.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I like the red and orange...    Especially b/c it goes with their culture...  Chinese brides usually wear red, not white...  :)|`|HLBdtP1Uaa	Love the last one. The red and black make a very bold statement. But you may blend too much with your bridesmaids.   The 1st one would be my second choice and the orange my 3rd.    Good Luck!|`|0Id85yiYaa	i like  1|`|2G8lOPN8aa	Okay--here are my thoughts... I love number one because it seems the best compromise between eastern and western ideas of wedding attire--the Chinese styling--but still white.    The second dress looks more traditional for China as I know that red is the color of good fortune.  I like that one if that is something that matters more to you.    The third dress I think is too much of a departure from western ideals--the black to me is just not suitable for a wedding.  Too much black.    If it were me, I would go for number one.  I think they are all stunning though. :)    * * *    Oh I didn't realize the second dress was orange and not red...color is hard to read on the monitor I guess...    Since the dresses are all to be custom made--can you not ask for elements of each to be incorporated?  If you like the headress of the third...why can not that be made to go with the second dress?  And why can't the second dress be made in a more traditional red?  It's your special day--why can't you have what YOU want--especially since it's already there on the darned dolls--pick a la carte and tell them that's what you want. :)    I don't think the beading or design is lost in the white. I think it is just more elegant that way--it is not over the top--it is understated in a very rich way.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Well, I just need to say WOW. Definitely number 2!|`|qjcTW2vJaa	I like the first one best, kind of like Ice Queen in a good way though! The third one looks kind of Russian to me (prob because of the colors) and the second one has a bit too much going on in my opinion. But this is just my personal taste and you seem to like stronger colors better? Best of luck, you'll be gorgeous in either one of them!   (By the way, I dont think the bridesmaid dress would look as good with the 2nd or 3rd dress ....too similar. The white dress will stand out nicely!).|`|RKMxAKDIaa	i like the first one best it looks chinese style  (if that's the theme your going on) and its very Beautiful also i think white is a good wedding dress  colour to go with!   good luck x|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	depending on your skin tone, I LOVE THE WHITE ONE.    I also love the red one  2 , WITHOUT the hanging tassles.    I lke the last one 3 with out the headdress and black swall thingy.    BUT the first one is the best at blending western and eastern|`|TUNvbXbgaa	the first dress is BEAUTIFUL i would go with that one|`|r5AbT6tmaa	Dress 1 definitely. Not sure about the dark colors of the other two.|`|JII8tDbjaa	the first|`|LAXbJfvwaa	I am a westener so of course I am going to go for the white/grey one.  I think the detail does stand out because it is silver - but I suppose I like this one because it is more what I am used to.  I also prefer the head piece as it is beautiful and has the asain theme - without being quite as dramatic as the other two.  (Again - the western influence in me coming out!)    The second one is lovely, however it is a bit fussy with all the beading and everything else - including the colours.  What if you changed the orange to white?  That means you would have both traditional wedding colours from the chinese and western heritages.    I would also suggest (since you mention there is too much black) that you change the black on the third dress to white.  I don't think it would look quite as lovely - as the colour really does ask for the black to make it pop.  So maybe I would just choose between the first or second dress.  And if your heart is really set on the head piece of this one then why not just use that with one of the other dresses - just in the colour of those dresses?    It really depends what sort of a wedding you are having as to what to choose.  I hope this has helped but I am sure any of the dresses will work wonderfully.  All the best for your wedding!|`|2TZOekoRaa	i like the white one the next one i like is the orange but i agree to much beading on it and i dont like the last on at all|`|5fDnoYCBaa	I like the first dress a lot. I like how it brings together two different worlds (which, I'm not sure, but maybe is symbolic of what this wedding is doing to your life?) with the white element of the western wedding and the chinese design. Is your wedding going to be colorful? If it is, you will definitely stand out with a white dress.|`|2HKltfZAaa	I love Dress  2(without the beads)|`|OXqLsFYxaa	No 1 is fabulous|`|hIwqr2Idaa	the white is absolutely gorgeous! Oh my! I agree with a previous answer that it brings together two worlds. The orange one I like next and it is also very beautiful, although no where near as beautiful to the white one in my opinion. The last is pretty, but pales in comparison to the others. I agree the black is a bit much.|`|UZ59uHlsaa	You're really trying to get people to look at your dolls, aren't you? The dolls are beautiful. I'm a designer too....I must say you're very resourceful...however,anyone with a design background would NEVER ask anyone for their opinion on something so special as a bridal gown. That was what gave you away! Then, I saw the name of the website.I clicked on thinking I was giving professional advice,not 'shopping'. Nice dolls though.|`|ZrjMeEGdaa	They're all gorgeous!    I love dress  1 and I think the beading is stunning with the silver and white.  I think you'd stand out the most in this dress since your   bridesmaids will be in red.     2 would be my second choice.    I do love  3 as well, but I think you may have a point about there being too much black for a wedding.    Best of luck!
gK0vcdnDaa	Do it!  Have your dream wedding.      I was planning on doing the same thing, but we opted against it.  It just makes sense for us to do it now (I'm 23, he's 25 and he'll be deploying in July).  No time like the present!    I think that holding the festivities on the Sunday before hand is a great idea.  Gives you your anniversary to begin a first/second honeymoon if that is somethign you are wanting to do.    I would stay away from a registry, simply because it may come across as gift-mongering 5 years too late.  If a guest feels obligated to give you something they'll give cash or they'll know what you want/need.  Give a list of a few items to your MOH so that if asked she can steer people in the right direction.    Wear the dress of your dreams!  White or otherwise, don't give yourself limitations based on the fact that you are doing a re-newal and not the "real-deal" this is your day to celebrate your marriage.    Congratulations and Good Luck!    -Elle|`|0Id85yiYaa	aww. how sweet! i would have it like a regular marriage cereomony, but on the invites write something like, "______ & ______ will finally be celebrating their marriage. please join us in our renewal of vows". you can wear whatever you want. if you want a white dress, wear it! the only thing about having it on a monday, a lot of people might not be able to make it. having it on the sunday before would be better, and you can still celebrate your anniversary on the 15th.    good luck!|`|AA11312653	Please do not try to have a wedding unless there is actually a marriage taking place. Have a gala party with a fancy cake, live band, catered meal, hired limo, oceans of champagne, and of course a wonderful new dress for you -- but not a bridal gown. Invite your guests to an anniversary party, but save the vow renewal part as a surprise. If you mention it on the invitations, the general reaction will be "Golly, do we have to buy them a present?" It is never incorrect to have a gift registry; what is incorrect is any hint that you expect or anticipate gifts. You mention the registry IF AND ONLY IF someone asks what sort of gift you would like -- you NEVER bring up the subject yourself or even hint at it. It is a very good idea to have the party on a weekend instead of on the actual anniversary date.    If you are thinking of this party as a sort of chance to make up for all the wedding presents and attention you didn't receive 5 years ago, please give this idea up. You are going to be dreadfully disappointed. Like many brides, you did not get the wedding of your dreams. You must live graciously with your regrets and understand how unlikely it is that your family and social circle will want to be involved in a "fake wedding" to make it up to you. They will find such a demand unreasonable and silly. Please think along the lines of "an anniversary party we will never forget" and not along the lines of "the wedding I was entitled to but didn't get."|`|JCAgvgTxaa	You ask:  Would it be tacky to have a registry even though we've been married for 4 years?    Yes.  Having a registry after 4 years of marriage would be inappropriate.    Because you have shared in their lives  by your friendship and love  the honour of your presence is requested  at the reaffirmation of the wedding vows of  NAMES  on DATE  YEAR  at TIME  LOCATION  ADDRESS  CITY, STATE    Having the vow renewal on the Saturday or Sunday before your anniversary would be fine.    All the vow renewals I have personally attended have been simple and elegant.  Bride had one attendant.  Groom had one attendant.  Some brides dressed more formally than others, but none wore white . . . and none wore veils.  All brides (and their attendants) either carried a small bouquet or wore a corsage.  The grooms (and their best men) all wore bouts.    Each vow renewal was a brief ceremony taking place after a regular worship service.    All these brides and grooms either hosted a luncheon or hosted a party at their homes . . . immediately following the vow renewals.    I think as long as you keep it simple and elegant, a vow renewal is fine. A wedding re-do or do-over is inappropriate.    Dress idea?  Isaac Mizrahi for Target? Cowl-Neck Dress - French Cream  Can be seen at the Target website and is on sale right now.  There are several simple, elegant gowns there in champagne or cream that would be appropriate.|`|29I8PWrxaa	I personally wouldn't have it on a Monday because less people will be able to come ... that being said, you can get some amazing discounts if you have your wedding on a weekday.  I think it would be fine to have it on the weekend though even if it isn't exactly the same day as your anniversary - people will get the point.    I would wear a white dress if you didn't get to do that in the civil ceremony.  How many brides these days are virgins anyway?    As for the registry, I don't know ... I would ask around in your family and see what everyone's opinion is on that.  Some people would say that's tacky, while others would say it's perfectly fine if you didn't get gifts the first time around.  Lots of people bring gifts to any party they go to anyway as hostess gifts since you are paying for their meal, etc.|`|Pwybznsxaa	Hi, I want to help you as best as i can but i only know what i've heard other people say. Here goes:    Registry-  I probably wouldn't have a registry, that's just me, though!    Invitations-  Mr. & Mrs. Williams cordially invite you to a/their vow renewal......  or  Mr. & Mrs. Williams request the honor of your presence at their vow....    Wedding dress-  You can wear whatever color you wish, if i were having a vow renewal i would choose off white or champagne    Date-  I think a Sunday wedding would be fabulous    Congratulations!!! May you and your husband have many more!

a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	As long as both sides are on board this sounds like a great idea!     Good luck!|`|76nTvO4iaa	You need to talk to the pastor at the church (building) where you want to be married and tell him what you want to do.  It might help if you have your mother and grandmother (if thery're around) to go to the meeting with you.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.  YES, he will be able to.  BUT.....it is really up to the pastor AT the church that you want to be married in.  If he is understanding and accepting of this (many do not like to do weddings anyway), then it's perfectly fine.  If he is not understanding, then he does have every right to refuse this.  Even though the church belongs to "everyone", he is the pastor and he has every right to insist on doing the wedding.  You need to contact the church you want to be married in AND that pastor and discuss this with him.|`|paerqxfMaa	He can, if he wishes and the Church recognizes him.|`|AA11603468	You can surely ask--there is no harm in that. My friend's father is an Orthodox priest. He married his daughter in another church at their permission.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Yes it is rude. If you want to use the church, you have to use the pastor that currently preaches there. If you want to use your current pastor, then find a venue that is large enough to accommodate everyone. If you aren't Catholic, then you can get married outdoors if you wish since God does exist in nature as well.|`|z4c7zGKmaa	Yes, this is do-able.  My church doesn't currently have a building (we meet in a school), so whenever someone from the congregation gets married, they have to rent a church and our pastor performs the ceremony there.    That being said, your pastor may feel funny 'upstaging' the rented church's pastor.  If he wasn't involved at all, I see no problem.  It's just because he would be involved in the prayer (or whatever) that your pastor may refuse.    When my pastor's son was getting married, the son wanted him to marry them in the bride's home church, but he wouldn't do it.  I believe he was the one saying the prayer or something, but he left the bride's pastor to perform the ceremony in the bride's church.    Sooo...It's do-able, but you have to make sure your pastor is willing.|`|yCjTBYAEaa	I think they would understand.|`|Grb85RJuaa	I don't think anyone can be mad at you for not wanting to get married in a coffee shop.|`|qttPOdRBaa	Your pastor can marry you in any church you want.|`|by9KuBizaa	As a courtesy, you need to speak with the Pastor of the church where you wish to have the ceremony and he may need to get permission from the Church Board.  Since you grew up in that church, you have relatives there and given that your current church worships in a coffee house, I suspect that you would be given permission.  Again, the courteous thing to do would be to include the pastor of the church where you wish to hold the wedding, as you noted, by saying a prayer or blessing.    When I got married, we got married in a Protestant church where my husband and I were both members.  However, we included a Catholic priest who was very good friends with my husband.  Everyone agreed.  The pastor and priest, my husband and I agreed on who did what part and all worked well
0da6ab3c6b462dc6d34ee0177bdc0459aa	Have to be smart and talk to the police for investigater.

884v4VhGaa	Ask her if she'll go to couples counselling with you, even if she doesn't want to get married anymore. It's useful at times other than when you're about to get married. It sounds like she could use some personal counselling, but since this affects your relationship a lot, both of you should be looking for outside help.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	If you truly love each other then you would not be having these problems, cut your losses and move on.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I think you didn't give the relationship enough time to develop before getting engaged.  It takes time for trust to develop.  If you have only met in person twice, you probably didn't have enough time for that to happen, especially if she was hurt in a previous relationship.  She probably got nervous about being in such a serious commitment with somebody she wasn't sure she could fully trust yet.  It's up to her if she wants to give things another go, but if she does, you need to make sure you are not pushing things farther than what she is ready for.|`|f8d92f3eb007519c9b860a9f841dfb1caa	Well, go out and travel to her. Tell her exactly how u feel. What you're telling us right now. It seems to me that she sees you as one of those abusive guys. Who started out nice but then ended up all wrong. She just doesn't want to get hurt again. Trust me, she still does love you. Because if she didn't. She wouldn't have made the effort to call/text back. Remember, shes the woman of your dreams. And you don't want to let her slip away. Its obvious the abuse from her former relationships were so bad. That its hurting both her and you. So go out there and get your girl.|`|2o2jCzryaa	Just give her space! You have to understand shes been in abusive relationships and she is confused. She doesnt know how to trust people and if you really love her you will respect and give her space.

You are offering her a better life, and you sound like a genuine guy, so why are you putting all your effort into her?    You're going to have to move on.  It's pretty obvious that she isn't in love with you, and you need to show yourself some self-respect and move on.  Find a girl at your church.|`|qttPOdRBaa	Cut the drama, tell the truth and shame the devil.  You know that's what you want.|`|UY6mkCk2aa	Believe me, she does love you, it is just going to take some time for her to get back to normal with all the things she's been through. It'll probably be on and off with her from time to time, and trusting someone again after that person abused her is going to be difficult... I know that you really do have feelings and care about her but just give her some space. But not too much, don't just wait around for her to call because she'll just think you've moved on. Go out there and run after her ! Prove to her its not all about the physical relationship and make a compromise. Make it clear that you will wait as long as she wants you to until you are both truly ready !      Good Luck ! :)|`|Ye9xBchRaa	Ok first she may have used u to get the ring crazy i know but it may have been a scam. Second she just got a change of heart cause your so far away and probably found someone or got back with her ex. I think you should let her know you are not waiting any longer and then move on find someone close. I think the experience factor in the bed room could have turned her off. Find a virgin and share that experience of love with her she is out there good luck.
1Mc6BOvKaa	As far as I know Asos is a UK firm, so there wouldn't be any customs charges to be paid. They also have a prepaid postage system with Royal Mail, so there wouldn't be charge for insufficient postage. So, don't be too harsh on your friend for that, it is unlikely that there would be a charge for that.   Also, even if there was a charge, you don't pay the postman (we aren't allowed to handle cash), he just posts a note to you, saying the items have been held back because of money owing - in which case, you simply have to go down to the Delivery Office, pay the money and collect your items. I would have thought your friend would have just told you about receiving this note.  It is more than likely that Asos messed up the addresses (you say yourself). I have seen Asos parcels with poorly printed address labels, often with crucial parts of the address cut off or missing (for example, its hard to direct a parcel to "1, North Street, London" without a postcode to differentiate between the different North Streets in different areas of London). If the parcel can't be directed, it will be returned.      On a different note, your friend is probably just as upset as you are, but she probably could be more helpful, just explain.|`|QB3dXwsDaa	You made me angry now!!!! lol  You need to tell her all of this!!|`|zG4QCxK7aa	i cant believe what a big deal your making out of this, its dresses for gods sake, and it doesnt sound like your friend was totally  having a go at you for it... anyways, just let it go...|`|LXEqtNlbaa	clearly shes been snacky!!! just say it to her again and if she doesnt agree just say well then we cant get the dresse can we    soon should work|`|bgbUQ3Wnaa	well that sucks and all, and i am mad with you at her. you have to tell her that you went through h-e-double hockey sticks getting the dresses and say you're sorry for not having them in time.    try talking to her or wait for her to talk to you..  she is being a jerk though!!|`|nnqcYoNwaa	that's just rude. She was totally wrong for what she did.
UspK4SQBaa	That is not a decision that I can make for you.  My thoughts are that the trust he had is now broken.  He has to earn it.  To take him back on faith would be disrespectful to both you and your children.|`|4gZYucHMaa	has there been problems within the marriage prior to his cheating?    If so I'd say no don't take him back bc until those probs are resolved he's going to keep doing it.    Trust will take time to rebuild, I think it can happen if you want it to and if he keeps his word but it's a hard spot to be in    I say trust your heart.|`|TRrTunqvaa	i wouldnt take him back|`|AA10248966	Move on. The leopard does NOT change the color of its spots. He should first get psych testing for emotional and behavioral disorders and get pro help.|`|AbAHhcwiaa	if she is still living there then its pretty risky, try going ever there for some short visits, but if you have two little girls keep it on the DL.|`|GjsrcsZkaa	The things people would jeopardize. He has a wife and two kids yet where is his respect, morals for you and your family. VOWS means nothing nowadays not like in our grandparents days....Don't divorce the fool because you have a family and more important thing to worry about but just keep your head up for you and your daughters because your obviously better than that but if you feel it running through your head constantly or bothering you alot separate and try to get your own place. You guys will be able to fix things again it may take time but it will be fixed ..GOOD LUCK AND STAY STRONG|`|09Y8F6hQaa	Before he cheated, he realized that he was attracted to the person living with you.  He should have found a reason for her to move out, before cheating.  I don't think you can trust him again.|`|7Bb53RIDaa	Seriously cheating is wrong but if you still love him and he promises never to do it again. I would take him back just because you have two daughters. My parents got divorced worst years of my life. It's not fair to do it to the kids that did nothing wrong. If it weren't fot the kids than i would say forget him but...|`|baxhcxOeaa	I would say no if it was me. But it's not me. Only you can decide. I know this is heart breaking. But be strong.x|`|lJhl3wLAaa	He made a bad choice. He would probably do it again. The fact that he didn't respect your marriage or your children is sad. He was only thinking of himself.|`|uetenAeRaa	no, only go forward in life and not backwards.  he cheated and broke your trust and vows.  you can love him and not be with him.  be strong for your kids.    good luck|`|cDRXtuJCaa	no i think it be mistake hower if you took it really slowly do not live with him for a long time or give him sex then you see if he the real deal  However if you living with someone you need to bring it to an end and in a way your cheating this person now which is not nice and they deserve better|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	That's only a decision for you to make. I know that if my husband cheated on me it would be hard but I don't think that I could take him back. If he loves me then he should only want to share something like that with me. It's one thing to have fantasy's and stuff but to act on it is wrong. That's my opinion though. Good luck and god bless you!|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	If you love him, then see if he agrees he screwed up and needs help. Ask him to go to counseling or therapy...for a while.     If he refuses and just wants you to believe him...don't.    Unfortunately, liars, cheaters and abusive men seldom change.    Good luck.|`|7qztuwSIaa	how could u ever trust a man that could sleep with another woman? a guy who could do that to you and your daughters? he slept with  someone despite how much he "cared for you and you daughters". dont do it. you can find better, you know you can, dont doubt yourself.|`|AA11288692	No. Once a cheat, always a cheat. If you take him back he'll think that if he does it again, you'll just take him back.|`|AzuAPe2raa	You really need to sit down and talk with him.  Us men can make mistakes especially when it comes to sex.  I know that things can happen and you regret it later but at the time the "other" head does the thinking.  If he really does love you, he will do everything to make you trust him again.  I think that you should give him a chance if he really means it.  Let him earn your trust again and let him show you how sorry he is.|`|WyMpM4Zoaa	Well this is all you! You have to see for yourself if he has change and what step is he trying to take to prove you that he is a better and for you to aknowledge before giving your final answer!|`|7zGV7LmKaa	I have to agree with the other girls in this thread, once a cheater always a cheater. It represents a struggle he is going through when he is in a relationship with you. Unfortunately it is not a solvable one so he turns to cheating. Its time to move on my friend...
AA10065812	In 20 years of working with fathers, I've never seen the court take personal property into account for anything except child support arrearages.  Unless you are renting it out, it isn't earning income and child support is based on earned income.  To do so, it would set a precedent that can swing both ways, such as reducing child support when a custodial parent is living with someone and not contributing to the rent or house payment.    Now, you do know that under federal Public Law 12, child support enforcement is obligated to represent either parent, upon request, for an increase or decrease in child support.  So, go to them first and take witnesses in case they give you a hassle.  You could consider taking a female with you and have her ask the initial question about modifying child support.    Secondary to that, check with the Clerk of the Court about a form for filing Pro Se.    Get a copy of the child support guidelines and worksheet from CSE to determine if you has cause.  There needs to be at least a 20% difference in his payment.    If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  The organization it came from is defunct due to attorneys that tried to take it over and make money from it.    Take the time to learn what you can and should do.    http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/GiveKidsAC...  http://www.glennsacks.com|`|AA10248966	They cannot force you to sell, but they certainly might not lower your responsibilities if the opposite side has good legal representation and says the house is worth so many dollars and is expensive to run. In fact, the others side can counte : when you request downward modification, they   can counter your motion with one of their own and request upward modification.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	They certainly will consider that an asset.    So it seems there are two possibilities.    1. They may require you to take a line of credit against the property.    2. They may grant a temporary reduction, but require you to pay the shortage when your situation improves.    Sorry...but that's the sort of compromise I've heard of.    Good luck.
Vdnrn9Bvaa	refuse to eat. eventually when you only weigh like 50 pounds they will start to get worried.|`|cGbTJobeaa	So....what did you do?    It kinda depends on the severity of what you did. I mean, if you did something really bad, then a month might be appropriate.  Just suck it up and don't do that again.    If your parents told you to stop back talking and you kept arguing with them and they said "do you want to make it two weeks" and you kept smarting off while they extended the grounding deadline...well, them's the breaks and you have to suck it up because you couldn't keep your yap shut when they were giving you the opportunity.    Finally...if  you just did something a little bit bad and your parents gave you the punishment while they were angry, then just be on your best behavior. Being grounded can be pleasant or unpleasant. It depends 100% on YOUR ATTITUDE.      You convince to reduce your grounding by your actions instead of by your words.   If you are pleasant and respectful and find things to do at home that you enjoy instead of being a mopey whiny baby, your parents are much more likely to reduce your sentence than if you are a pain in the butt over the next 4 weeks.|`|2AylNnmXaa	Swearing?  A month is way too long.  I could see a few days at the MOST.|`|BjtqWNt8aa	Do what they say, when they tell you to do it. Don't back talk, don't give them dirty looks and don't grumble. If they feel you have been punished enough, they'll take the month off, themselves. If you ask, they'll just more angry with you...so don't ask.|`|WOHc22Xiaa	Do the crime do your time. Then don't do it again!lol
oJ0p2Ietaa	sometimes friends can feel threatened buy other friends, thats why some people have different groups of friends, its hard to find a group of friends who all like each other.|`|5t0DYU6Baa	had the same problem  I was stupid enough not to stop being her friend but still hang out with the others until she went and turned everyone against me because she was jealous she wasn't my only friend...|`|LXEqtNlbaa	yeah i no, 2 b honest if she was a genuine best friend she'd make an effort|`|sM8PKUtoaa	If U stay with her - you will turn like her. Better to mix with different people - you will grow as a person that way. Some people are trapped in a shell they cant get out of and that sounds like your friend. Fine still be friends with her, but make sure she is just 1 of your friends + not your only friend...|`|wav24Tquaa	omg i am the exact same lately with my best friend!!

It happens.    Sorry if things don't work out...|`|7F8jjzhaaa	she sounds insecure. maybe she likes you and you arn't taking the hin, 'cause it sounds to me like she wants you all to herself. or maybe her critisims are right, it's often hard to judge your own friends from the inside looking out. she might feel out of place with your buddies too, she just doesn't know how to act around them because you guys are already close and she feels left out.    just some thoughts. hope it helps :)|`|hH7sbqszaa	maybe yr mate is jelouse of yr other friends, u should talk to her and if she cant be normal get rid!!!!!!|`|MhxyFcg2aa	Just say to her/him that you want to hang out with these people aswel and its not all about them so if they to join in they can but make them promise they wont be mean or anything.  They cant have all the attention and people do need more than one friend :P
IPS3hWweaa	No! Why would I want to have sex with someone who reminds me of my mom?!? Seriously!    What about women? Do women marry men who are like their own fathers? Do you want to be humping some dude who looks like your dad or reminds you of your dad?!?    I couldn't do it, but if you can, more power to ya.|`|yRZuoyPXaa	Maybe cook like their moms.  Or maybe who fusses about them like moms.  Would you marry a woman if she were a ****** (Clean your room!  Take out the trash!) like your mom?|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I would hope not, matter of fact I looked for someone totally different, who wants to marry an alcoholic and abuser.|`|AA11946996	Honestly, I sure did. Even though I didn't know it at the time. She is just like my mother too. Kinda scary if you ask me!|`|bO2rzfISaa	My experience has been that men do marry women like their moms, which leads to a lot of the MIL problems you hear about. People who are exactly alike, especially when it's strong and independent, don't get along too well.|`|aSSXt6tlaa	I suppose there is a little truth to this, however, not in the sense that everybody on here assumes.    I read a book once called: "Getting the love you want" and it describes people in general choosing mates that resemble in a familiar way their primary caretakers.  Not necessarily physical characters, but something that is 'familiar' in terms of who they are.    Following this general idea, it is not surprising that children of divorced parents are likely to choose relationships that end in divorce where children of parents that had healthy marriages and provide a stable childhood are more likely to choose success mates and remain married.|`|LLgLPEPUaa	Yes, it is 100% true.  And girls tend to like guys who are similar to their fathers.    It's all biological and is a part of your "love map" the features and characteristics you've learned are attractive in the other sex.|`|f7e207bacb96e05453dd798123720f46aa	To an extent it is, not necessarily someone "like" our mothers, but someone who makes us feel valued and loved like our mothers.|`|cDRXtuJCaa	lol i hope not or i be single a long time as lol i nothing like my bf mother thankfully|`|6rruGxhzaa	i think this is true.... and i see it happen often, i do not think it is purposefully done however.|`|RHux2Fmnaa	I'm nothing like my husband's mother, so I think he's either the exception or that theory is not really true. His mother abandoned him when he was born and left with her lover (not my husband's father). She's never been a loving mother; she's never taken good care of herself (and it -clearly- shows) she looks like a man; she didn't get an education and she's vulgar, cheap and incredibly ignorant. I'm -definitely- not -at all- like her. I would never leave my baby behind to run after a man and I've always loved school and made sure -no matter what the circumstances- I got an education. When I talk to her, half the time, I can't even understand what she's saying. When I asked my husband if he'd marry a woman like his mother he just said: "UUGHH!!" Never!|`|ZCxeEwXZaa	No I didn't in fact she was the complete opposite and most girls I went out with in the past were nothing like my Mom. Nothing against Mom its just not what I would go for in a woman. I don't like the real conservative do whatever I say type. I like a woman who speaks her mind and will tell me when I am doing something right or wrong. Not a puppet. Sorry went on a little vent there.|`|gfHutvEFaa	No. I am nothing like his mother. She was really short, dark haired, pretty big, and grumpy.    I am tall, thin, blonde and a straight shooter with a pretty happy disposition (most of the time, lol).    I guess it's possible with some people though.|`|Jolz0CVvaa	two words: oedipal complex
7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	Did he ask you to marry him, or are you just hoping he will?    He's already lived half of his life where as you are only beginning the journey of yours.  And when his health starts to decline, you will be a nurse maid to him while you are in the prime of your life.    What you feel may be special to you, but you have to remember he is a widower.  He misses his wife, and you're the sexual replacement.  His kids are nearly the same age as you.    I think you need to focus on your future.  What if in another 5 or so years you want to start a family?  He'll be like a grandfather to his own kids, and he probably won't want kids at his age.|`|PvAIY7OPaa	I'm not surprised with you because you hardly know what you talking about but I'm surprised with the man who wants to marry you.Why he cannot find intelligent assertive woman from his league.He definitely cant because they won't give him a second look. That is my guess.Marry him and enjoy life if you love him and hope his daughter is fine with it.|`|mOayTJDmaa	He is having a son and daughter...why...is he pregnant.  Sure, marry him, I don't care.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	Is his name Drew Peterson, by any chance?|`|vyNlyfczaa	if this is something what you want to do and you are sure do it...but remember....his kids are almost your age (guarantee problems) and in like maybe 10-15 years you are going have to take care of him! (old age sicknesses and stuff)  Do you want have any kids? in my opinion you should wait like 10 more years and then we can talk if you still want to marry him!|`|ZXhpEuGpaa	I don't want to come off rude,but when your in the prime of your life,you'll be having to put him in a nursing home which will only be 20-30years,but i bet by then you'll met someone closer to your age and you will not want to be with him anymore,because by then he will not beable to provide for you n certain ways,although if you really feel like he is the one that is your decision to make,sounds like your unsure,there's your answer.|`|tM2MN5NOaa	1st of all I`d be very careful what you do from "now on" the "age diffierence between you both" is huge. 30yrs. thats a lot. Although now its not a problem - a few years down the road it will be "massive to you" and you will be trapped. when your 50 he will be 80yrs old.    Pehaps you should just look at your friendship and keep as it is (If you still want it) then if you have a change of heart later on you can "walk away from this" You say you`ve known him for 15yrs that means when you were 5yrs old........I`m not sure about this at all.    If you go ahead with this you will find as time goes by you have less and less in commom with each other than before - simply because of the "age diffierence" the feelings you have now will change - its human nature......you`ll want diffierent things than him and then the trouble will start. and as we all know "sex is not love" I can`t help feeling "he`s being selfish toward you" by him thinking this marriage will take place. he would know all the "pitfalls ahead for you both" and in 10yrs he will be 60.........allthough you "love him" he`s to old for you. and you will regret it.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If you even have to ask someone if you should marry someone then I don't think you should. If you are madly in love with someone then you will know in your heart the answer. If you love him then you shouldn't be able to live without him. It's only a question you can answer yourself. I think that's a little weird that you've known him since you were 5 and now you're sleeping with him. That's a little gross!|`|d36f7c4fb8b8952c08aa3139dc2554b9aa	Well, I am sorry, but that is just not right.  A man his age is very desperate by the sounds of it.  That is like a 30 year old dating a new born.  So, when he was 30, you were born.|`|RncUc0traa	if u love him marry him but a hope u ain a anna nicole smith money o!!!!|`|p2l8zQYuaa	If he makes you happy, marry him|`|scnW0Wzeaa	No|`|CCYWYk3qaa	I doubt his children would like it if their new "mom" was their age. Meaning you will not get any respect from them because it would be as if they were just hanging out w/ a friend of their's. He's just a desperate h*rny man who wants some lovin from a young girl who is attractive. And it being your boss as well...thats a little much right there. I'm sure ur having fun w/ this sexual fling but in reality in all seriousness it won't last. At his age men start having health problems too. Stick to ppl closer your age. Sryz ..|`|yhEDUN6qaa	He's old enough to be your dad and his kids would not respect you at all. I hate to factor in age when it comes to love. You may be young, pretty and maybe smart but would you be a good mother to his kids?  Probably not, in fact he would most likely treat you like a child. How will this affect your job? What happens in 10 years when you're 30 and hes 60? Do you love him or do you love the things he can provide for you at such a young age. Really think about these things.|`|6BffDmjsaa	perossnlly no, da age diffrence shows da exprience levels, compelty diffrent, by they tim ur his age u might have made a mistake, if u really want to marry him wait 5yrs n see if u still want to marry him, but personally dont do it, he's ur boss u shoudl have never crossed that line in the first place, buiness n love dont mix, 50 n 20 is a huge gap, people arent always what they seem, ur to young to be even having sex with sum one more then twice ur age|`|h1wQDMT1aa	hey,,,your age gap is quite far.......its like having a relationship with grandfa,,,ask yourself a million times if you are ready to face the burdens having a called son and daughter almost at your age.  the decisions is all yours, just weight in the advantage and dis advantage,then decide.|`|f7e207bacb96e05453dd798123720f46aa	I can promise you this, if you marry him, you will end up divorced.

ONE THING IS THAT YOU SHOULD SPENN MORE TIME WITH HIS CHILDREN.|`|cee9f1031de69199cca4b81270c0bad6aa	You are so young.  Getting married to him can be nice in the first months. but after you begin to get more mature and attractive ,he will get aged,and the problems will emerge.  I think you wont be in love with him anymore then, and guess what?  I suggest to be more careful, thoughtful and wait until you are 25-26.then decide on such things.  God bless|`|x0pTYbdnaa	So you met this guy as a 5 year old and now you're having sex with him?    Can we say PEDOPHILE???    You should break up with this old man and get your own life on track.

MQowfPbOaa	you are right that it isn't fair how only you got in trouble. it is as much your fault as it is his, he shouldn't have had it and you shouldn't have done it. you should tell your parents how he was the one that brought it, maybe they will understand a little more and tell the school because it isn't fair how you got in trouble and he didn't.|`|o9Pzx2fcaa	Yeah he might seem cool but he's not the guy you wanna be around...  It's your fault for not thinking about the consequences for falling for peer pressure.  No body elses fault on the line here.
bQ2RWRGNaa	i like monkeys, do you?|`|vHDiHL43aa	You don't have to say either of those things... can't you just be a good friend and tell her in a calm and cool way that you think she is a bit too Promiscuous. There really isn't much you can do though. Honestly... she's probably gonna do what she wants.
iPNOVR6Gaa	I honestly think that you are inadequately assertive.  If she didn't introduce herself to you, you should have introduced yourself to her.  If you thought she was giving you "dirty looks" (whatever that means), you should have politely struck up conversation with her and found out what was on her mind.  If you think your husband is flirting, you should tell him specifically the things he says that you believe are over the line and specifically ask him to stop saying those things.  If he doesn't show you attention, you should firmly request it and explain what form(s) you want it to take.  Honestly, be more assertive.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	You need to try talking to him again. Let him know that the way he is treating you is making you miserable. If he isn't willing to change, then you have to tell him that you don't want to be with him if he doesn't try to change. You don't deserve to be treated this way!|`|YuVSDBkzaa	If communicating with his about his behavior is not working, seek counseling.|`|bfP8tjPKaa	Honestly, something could be up. I am only 19 so I don't  know if you want my advice. But if he is obsessed with this girl and she was giving you looks, and he didn't even introduce you to her, PLUS he knows where SHE lives...  then something isn't right.    I really hope I am wrong... Good Luck, and no matter what be strong!      =)|`|8iYVHA1raa	I wouldn't necessarily say that he is cheating, probably just being himself - Based on the co-workers response to you  though, she sounds like she is jealous of you for being with him and not her.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Even if he is not cheating, he is cheating with them emotionally and that is robbing you of his affection.  He feels like he is in control of this relationship and can do what he wants, and your allowing it.  I would first attempt to talk to him in a non threatening manner, tell him your not happy with him and the lack of affection he is giving you.  If he blows you off and continues with his behavior, then it is time to really get his attention and file for divorce.  When he is served the papers he will come begging for your forgiveness.  At that point you will have regained control of your relationship and that will allow you to make your demands and get what you want out of this relationship.  Good luck.|`|rcut6bhoaa	Why is it women think that the men are to be the only ones that initiate intimacy.      I believe he is flirting with all the other women because that's how he is, normally.  Accept it for that.     Why cant YOU show him some attention at home?|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	Top 9 signs your spouse is cheating    You have a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach, something is not right but you cant quite figure out what that feeling is about. Your spouse has become distant, he/she is working late on a regular basis or, maybe your spouse has moved out of the house with no explanation.   You suspect there may be someone else but every time you bring it up with your spouse, he/she denies the possibility. All the signs are there but you dont have any proof.     So, pay attention to the signs and your instinct but, be careful and dont confuse signs with proof.     1. "I'm not in love with you anymore."     If you hear these words, a big warning bell should go off. This is one of the most consistent things a cheating spouse will say. Your spouse may have a deep, loving bond with you but, intense feelings of passion can override the bond with you and cause your spouse to loose sight of his/her true feelings. The cheating spouse will develop what I call hormone - induced amnesia. The surging hormones and passion they feel in their new relationship can cause some very skewed thinking.    2. We are just friends.    This is also another very predictable statement that will come from a cheating spouse. If your spouse is spending more and more time with this new friend then there is probably more to it than mere friendship. Your spouse may feel they have a lot in common with this person, that this person understands them and things they are going through. Whatever the reasons for the friendship, its a big warning sign and one you should take seriously.    3. A sudden need for privacy.    If things the two of you used to share openly suddenly become private pay attention cause something is probably up. He/she may start password protecting computer activity. Cell phone and credit card bills may be hidden. If you ask why or attempt to find out information that used to be common knowledge between the two of you, you will be accused of snooping or trying to control your spouse. Big warning sign!    4. I need some space to figure my feelings for you.    Men and women who are involved with someone else will request more space, time alone or away from the family. They may say it is due to confusion over their feelings or stress at work. This can be a sign that there is someone else and the spouse is trying to figure out ways to have more freedom.    5. Regular work habits change.    Working late, going to work at odd hours or, putting in more time than is normal on work related issues can be indications that a spouse is cheating.     6. Spending a large amount of time on the computer.    In todays world, with modern technology, a person looking for an affair doesnt even have to leave their home. The ease of internet chat rooms, online dating sites and secret email accounts has caused an alarming increase in emotional affairs.  If your spouse is online more than usual, hanging out in chat rooms and visiting pornographic websites then you have reason to be alarmed.      7. Secretive phone calls and more time spent on the phone.    Emotional affairs occur primarily via the phone, especially cell phones. If you find your spouse hanging up suddenly when you enter the room or erasing the history on the cell phone and becoming defensive when asked about it, then you might want to check your phone records.    8. Behavior that just doesnt add up.    Not being where he/she was expected to be. Missing time they cant explain. Money that isnt accounted for. Receipts for things you don't have. Missing clothing. Clothing that does not belong to your family. Being caught in little lies about the details of the day.    9. Your Own fears and suspicions    If you find yourself looking for excuses for your spouse's behavior or trying to convince yourself that they would never cheat then that is a warning sign. Your intuition is frequently one of the best indicators that something is wrong.     If you suspect your spouse might be cheating on you, do some investigating and then confront him or her with what you've found. Do it in a way that is calm and courteous. Ask for honesty. Be prepared for lies. It is a sad fact that people having affairs become excellent liars. People who never told a lie before in their lives.     Trust your gut instinct but get hard, cold proof also.

Did you try to introduce yourself to her?  Try not to think only of what negative things it could be.  Turn it into positives.  For example, when you feel she is giving you dirty looks, smile and go up to her, shake her hand.  Tell her you hear about her all the time.  Be the better person, rather than one who is holding all the anger from the negative possibilities.      I don't think he is cheating, I think he just wants attention from women.  He may be attracted to her, but it may be with the sociable way, rather than physically.      Another thing I would try is to sit down with your husband.  First tell him some things that you really admire in him.  Tell him what you love about him.  Give him compliments.  Leave him little notes around where he will find them.  Do those little things that makes him think of you, even when he is at work.  It will put a smile on his face.    Also sit down with him and tell him that you feel a bit lonely and neglected and all you hear from him when he comes home is about that female co-worker.  Tell him it makes you feel like he cares more for her than you, your wife.  Tell him that you fear that he will be fired for sexual harassment when he says certain things to the other female co-workers.      Make plans with him on how you can put more spice into your relationship.  Tell him you need to feel wanted.  (By the way, once you start doing the little things that make him think of you, he will start doing the same).  Make a date night once a week with him.  Tell him you want to spend more quality time with him, this also means to leave work at work.  You don't want to hear about work at least one night a week.    Open and honest communication and trust make for a stronger relationship, even when the things can be difficult to talk about.    I will pray for your strength and wisdom and courage.  God Bless.|`|CD4opYEkaa	What should you do? That's really a tough one to answer. I would say with 99% surety he's fooling around. But what should you do about it? There's really not a whole lot you can do other than confront him about it. He probably won't fess up, but he will know that you are on to him. When he does, he'll either quit or he'll tell you that it's probably time to go separate ways.    By the way,  *** MILDRED SENT ME***

6TC0cjAgaa	I don't think its wrong.. not all parents control their children well and if you have for example.. a chocolate fountain then you could have chocolate all down your dress!!! and if you are having alcohol i don't think that children should be there i don't believe that children should be exposed to adults drinking!!!    but you are going to have to realist that some people will have a problem with this.. your best bet is to    --hire a babysitter that can watch all of the kids so that parents coming to the wedding won't have to pay for a babysitter     --on the Save the Date card and the invitation say that it is an adult event.. and put your phone number and email in the envelope with it and expect people to say but what about my kid.. have good reasons why you don't want them to come and you should be OK..    but you still have to know that some people will bring their children still and your going to have to deal with that too!!!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	tell him how much it will cost- $50-$100 for each toddler to throw filet mignon on the floor is not a good investment.  of course you're not wrong, tons of people don't have kids at their wedding.  your fiance will find that the children of those in the bridal party will be more than enough to have around.  it's a formal event like a corporate party or ball, and you don't see kids at those.|`|hkwBR1moaa	It's not wrong unless you invite some kids and not others.  Excluding the ones standing of course.|`|0Id85yiYaa	i don't blame you for not wanting kids. i wouldn't want to risk one of them crying in the middle of the ceremony or making a scene at the reception. however, people that DO have kids have a much different opinion. my best friend and her husband refused to go to his best friend's wedding (even though he was a groomsman) b/c they wouldn't let their kid go. if you decide not to have them come, you have to be prepared for these types of things to happen. in the end, it's your day and if those parents put themselves in your shoes, they might understand.|`|0wTzlG2haa	It's a personal choice. We had kids at our reception but that was because we have a lot of friends with kids and a number of those kids (7 kids between the ages of 12 and 1) were in the ceremony. Besides which, our reception was on the smallish side (about 100 people including kids) and we made sure our food (buffet style) was inexpensive and mostly kid friendly - we even had a chicken fingers for them! We didn't do an open bar but had soda, non-alcoholic punch, coffee and tea available with a cash bar. We also had favors that were just for the kids and favors that were just for the adults. It all worked incredibly well for us and kept the cost fairly low.    Figure out how much it might cost to have kids at the reception and go from there. I've also been at weddings where they hired a babysitter to watch the kids in a hotel room while the parents were at the reception.    That said, do what you want. It is your day after all and your fiancee's day as well. See if there is some kind of compromise you can make|`|kUE3Ddktaa	You're not wrong, but you need to be prepared for some of your guests to decline your invitation if they can't bring their children, especially out-of-towners.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	no you're not wrong.  everyone has their tastes, and it's possible that kids at a reception may not mix.  i've been to both and it's perfectly acceptable to do either way.  you and your fiance will have to come to an agreement on it, however.|`|HLBdtP1Uaa	A friend of mine is doing that. She is putting " Adult reception to follow" on her invites. SHe doesn have 2 little girls in her Bridal party though and that's it.     It's a tough decision. I am having kids at mine because there are alot of family and friends that have kids. I wouldn't want them to have an added worry at the wedding. Bring them along, it will be fun!|`|0PgHuHosaa	I don't think you are wrong.  My mom didn't have kids at her wedding either and chooses not to bring me and my sister, because, yes it does get expensive.  But, not only is it expensive, kids like to run around.  Don't expect them to sit still during dinner and when the music starts, they'll be running everywhere.  I remember one time a little kid ran right into a waiter carrying a bunch of plates.  8 stitches later, the mother of that child still blames the bride!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Kids don't cost anywhere near as much as adults do to feed and water at a wedding. If your fiance wants them in attendance but you don't then you need to come to a compromise. Marriage is full of them so best start getting used to it now. But you can't play favorites with kids either or else you will have upset parents who wonder why you have a flowergirl who is able to attend but their kids are evil in your eyes.    Edit: if you do choose to invite kids, they need to be included in the headcount that is given to the caterer but most caterers offer children's meals that are less than $10/person.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	We are choosing an adult-only event as I don't want to spend my time entertaining children and I think their parents deserve a break too! There will be no kids at our ceremony or reception. We are not doing it because of the extra expense, but because we don't want anyone crying/screaming/talking/pooping/peeing or otherwise being disruptive during the ceremony. We are hiring a babysitter for our nephew because his mom (who is a bridesmaid) will still be breastfeeding him at the time so we are accomodating, she will have easy access to him. It's personal preference, you are not obligated to do or have anyone.     Good luck!|`|aH0yYcTIaa	Its a touchy subject, there's no question that some parents may be offended if the kids are not invited. Also they may or may not come if they have to hire a sitter.    Now, if you want no kids, I wouldn't have any in the bridal party either. Because those parents who weren't able to bring theirs will wonder why the invite said no kids, and there are kids in the party.|`|z4c7zGKmaa	The decision is up to you whether to include kids or not  Just make sure that you either invite all the kids or none of the kids.  The ONLY exception to this rule is the kids who are in your wedding party.    So, if you decide to not include the kids, you should be addressing the invitations to Mr. & Mrs. John Smith.  It should be clear that its not Mr. & Mrs. John Smith and family.  Then, make sure there is a space to write in how many will be attending on your RSVP cards.  If you get a number thats higher than 2 (the Mr & Mrs), you will have to call them to let them know that children are not invited.    You should not include a mention that its an adult only reception.  The invitations should be clear enough.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Children are not what makes a wedding expensive!    Wow, I'm liking the man you are going to marry. Hurray for him for realizing that weddings are for families - and that includes children of all ages!!!|`|f4c627930425c195d32f7d5a1017131aaa	Are you having a sit-down dinner? A good option is to have buffet style eating, when you give the caterer your guest count, exclude the kids from the number.|`|7nL1jY32aa	There is nothing wrong with that.  I am doing the same....Just put "Adult reception to follow"  on the invitation.|`|qRIMM2ycaa	You are wrong, just in that it can get expensive to feed kids.    Most caterers offer children's meals a lot cheaper. Offer them something simple to eat like a pasta dish. Kids don't want to eat fancy crap anyways.  Plus, kids can't drink alcohol, so you don't have to include them in that cost.    Whether or not you include kids should depend on what kind of reception you have though. If you're having an out door buffet style dinner, go ahead and include them. People will be up and mingling so it's okay if the kids run around, as long as they're careful not to run in to anyone or anything.  If you're having a 4 course sit down dinner, then maybe not. Kids won't want to sit down for that long and could get disruptive.    If you're honestly worried about the cost, cut adults out of the quest list. Kids will hardly make a difference.|`|irLnPW4aaa	I'm with you.  When we got married DH and I had about 12 younger cousins in the 10 and under range, plus all the other cousins kids...and   my MIL thought we should invite 'some' of them (which would have been tacky, IMO) but not others.  Well, the reception venue said that "children pay the same as adults" which seemed ridiculous when I was paying for a multi-course mean with open bar.  I couldn't see paying $40 (almost 20 years ago) each for 12 or more chidlren that wouldn't eat the meal anyway.  So we just spread the word :NO CHILDREN: and it was no problem  The only under 18's we had were my younger brother and my DH younger brother (who were 15 and 16).      You and your DF are going to have to come to some sort of agreement.

You can either chose to love your husband or choose to end things.  Long distance relationships are hard and he's not around to kindle the romance, fan the flame, so to speak.  There are a lot of variables to consider also, like why did he leave, when is he returning, does he love you, do you trust him to be faithful to you while he's away?  The only advice I can give you is to pray about it and discuss things with your husband.  Good Luck!|`|CD4opYEkaa	Maybe you just need to get out in order to find that answer to that question.

We talk on the phone and over the computer.  The love I have for him has grown deeper and stronger.  When he calls I get butterflies  all over again like I did when we were dating.  What has helped our relationship is the communication between the two of us.  We have been able to open up to one another and share thoughts that we otherwise may not have been able to share face to face.   I cant wait to see him again.. I miss him so much.  They always say to test true love,  separation is the key.  I wouldn't automatically say you don't love him anymore,  you are just in your comfort zone with no excitement or anything to look forward to.. Spice things up a little... Talk about things you want to do with him when he gets home and hopefully it will get him to tell you some of the same.. It is amazing what this can do to a relationship... GOOD LUCK!!

NR6y68U3aa	You are headed for big trouble!!! It is extremely inappropriate.  Your teacher should not be acting in such a personal way towards any student.      If you are the one that has the crush and is reading more into his behavior, than you need to stop.  He can go to prison for 5-15 years, then when he gets out he will never be able to teach again, never be able to be around children again and will have to register as a sex offender.  That record never goes away.  You will ruin his life.    If he is the aggressor or instigator then you need to report him.  And get out of that situation, it can ruin your life too.    I went to school with a boy that was used by his teacher and ended up fathering a child with her when he was in 8th grade.  She went to prison, it messed he up, he was involved with drugs, he was really withdrawn and a loner.  Everyone talked about him.  You don't want that kind of life?|`|6lkNOFNlaa	It's a difficult one. It is possible for you to be friends with a teacher outside school as long as it is just friends and nothing more.  I think it's a bit odd to enjoy watching movies together etc, but it depends how old he is.|`|wNSI1wdCaa	I wasn't thinking he was a rapist at all. I don't think there is anything about this relationship to be worried about really.|`|Uz4QLyZxaa	well i think its kinda weird for a girl to be with a boy teacher, but just be careful and if u feel uncomterble, then get da  hell out!!!|`|xLXqEWVgaa	Your note does not mention if anything inappropiate has taken place. I think he should play it safe and ensure that there is always someone else present.  I also think he violates professional code by sharing information about other students with you.    I think that it would be best that you do not engage in communication with this teacher that is outside the instructional day.  It is inappropriate to have an amorous relationship with an instructor when the student is underage.
pMsMx817aa	you can't do anything  she's an adult and has to make her own choices    ella|`|0Id85yiYaa	there's not much you CAN do. if you want to have a relationship with your daughter you have you support her no matter what. however, if you do have proof that this guy is doing drugs and they have children one day, i would call the cops if the child is in danger. otherwise, she's an adult and can make her own decisions. she has to learn on her own.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	continue to talk to her, but don't push so hard against it that you push her away.  don't use arguments against the guy specifically -- instead, talk about how young she is.  that might encourage her to wait, rather than making her feel you're attacking her guy, which is going to make her want to do exactly the thing you're trying to get her not to do (trust me, i saw this with my sister growing up!)    i'm mom of 2, and there's been many times i haven't liked their choices, but once they hit 18 and/or moved away from home, their choices are their own and all you can do sometimes is let them learn from your mistakes.    would you have listened to your parents at the same age?  i'm not sure i would have.|`|k6F9zkIRaa	Well, there really isn't much you can do considering she is 18. Do you know for a fact that he is on illegal drugs? You could always call the police on him. But even then your daughter would probably be pretty upset with you. All you can do is express how you feel and hope she does the right thing. She is young but she'll wise up.|`|FVFxE6owaa	Unfortunately the law considers your daughter to be old enough to make her own decisions so there's not much you can do.  Just be there for her when the marriage ends in divorce.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	I'm so sorry.  Not much you can do.    If you're paying for college and/or supporting her financially, make it clear that once she's married, she is a grown woman responsible for her own expenses. (are you sure she's not on drugs too?)    take her out to lunch or dinner alone.  I assume you've objected to this guy already ("BUT daddy, I LOVE him.  He'll change for me.  It will be better after we're married. blah blah blah).  DO NOT MAKE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THE GUY.  NONE. Lunch/dinner is to ask her if she is sure about what she is doing and to inform her that while you don't agree with her choice of a husband, you aren't going to stop her from marrying.  You will tell her that you will no longer support her financially.      It's up to you if you want to pay for a wedding or not--personally I wouldn't and I'd state my reason for not paying as I don't have confidence in the marriage and can't in good conscience encourage her to do something I think is a disaster waiting to happen.  (I would take what money I planned on spending on a wedding or whatever money you were using for college and set it aside in a bank account for her so when she has to flee the marriage she has a nice nest egg to restart her life.)    remain emotionally available to her, offer suggestions for how she can manage her life when she asks, recommend that she join NarAnon or AlAnon as she will need their support when her husband's addiction becomes too much for her to handle.    sometimes you just have to let your loved ones make colossal huge mistakes and fall down and get hurt.|`|XRn0Ai3Naa	Nothing let her do what she wants to she is of age. Just let her learn the hard way trust me she will.|`|w9J25hq9aa	See if the dude can quit the drugs for a month. If he cant do it then it can show her that he love the drugs more than her.|`|Axtitdo8aa	Be there for her and support her...and be ready to pick up the pieces when she falls apart. There's not much else you can do.|`|8g51eBf1aa	Have a serious talk with her. Not from a parent's standpoint though. Do it as a friend. Tell her you care about her, and her well-being. And as a friend you don't want anything bad to happen to her. And that you're worried. That's what I'd do.|`|piJi29Traa	Wow, this could be my mum talking about me when I was younger, apart from the drugs bit - my ex-hubby was a Jehovah's Witness (well, from a family of them) and I just had to answer this from *my* point of view.  What people have said is right - she will learn the hard way eventually, unless she can be made to see BEFORE it's too late that being miserable is not a price worth paying to save face from making the wrong decision and being too stubborn to admit to making a mistake.  I broke contact with my parents over him for two years. It could well have been forever unless they had made the first move to contact me. They missed their first grandchild's first 22 months, and the birth of their second. All because I was too stubborn/scared of admitting they were right/stupid to act like a grown up, like I was always telling them I was.  If you can't make her see why you think she is making a mistake and that you care rather than just telling her because you are her parent, then the most important thing to do is give her as many opportunities for an "out" without losing too much dignity. Don't be tempted to say "I told you so" or "what did you expect?" when she comes to you with her relationship problems, let her know that you love her whatever she decides to do, be honest about your reservations about her relationship with him without sounding like you think she is immature or incapable in any way (that will only make her do the opposite just to try to prove you wrong).  At 18, I thought I was a grown up, responsible adult capable of making my own decisions. I'm not saying that wasn't the case, just that not having my family to fall back on (even if it was my own doing) caused me and my family a lot of heartache and ultimately meant I stayed in the relationship even longer than I would have done otherwise. Don't alienate her, don't give up on her, if she does go ahead and marry him she may need you more than ever. Even if she won't admit it!|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	Would marrying this guy be a way of her rebelling against you? Or moving out of your home? Do you think there is a reason why she wants to marry this guy? Or do you think that she honestly thinks shes inlove with him and plans to get married for all the right reasons?    You can oppose to the marriage, and by doing so you forfeit the right to attend the wedding, spend any money on the wedding, well really your giving up being involved completly    You could support her, but let her know you arent particularly happy about her decision, but will love her and help her anway.    or , you could just flat out lie and pretend to be happy for you.    Make a decision based on what is best for you, and not anyone else, at the end of the day, giving her your regrets for not attending, or supporting her even though youve made clear your reasons against the marriage, she will still be your daughter.  Some of the best lessons we learn in life are the ones we learn hands on, it might take your daughter awhile to see she made a poor decision, it might even take walking down the aisle, but you have to decide what your willing to support (if you are at all) and how much your willing to risk if you decide to not support her (this may mean loosing a relationship with your daughter).|`|AA10776535	You DONT support her...She is a big girl let her make her own choices, if you support her then your basically saying you agree with this marriage.  Don't do this, she will learn on her own.  Your not suppose to support bad decisions, just the good, stand your ground and dont attend this wedding if you do that will show support and you agree with it.|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear    You should have brought her up with Love and care for 18 years. I think there was a communication gap. Now you cannot cry over the split Milk.  If you are convinced that the guy is really into Illegal drugs you can report this to the police.  Try to make some concrete effort to establish a good repo with your daughter. Explain her the down side of such alliance, Try to understand why she made this decision. and then leave it to her to decide if she still wants him. she is mature and she can take her own decision|`|qRIMM2ycaa	Talk to her, and let her know you're only worried about her.    You can't make her do anything, and threatening to not support her will only alienate her.  She has to learn from her own mistakes.|`|g5V7jhIpaa	Pray for her if you are religious. Last year, my then 18 year old, moved in with a much older man, older than me, I was 38 ...he was 46 years old. His circumstances were suspicious to me and sure enough, after living 3 months with him, she discovered he had a whole set of dentures which made her realize he was way too old for her! It was funny at that very moment when she called to tell me but I was very relieved. I prayed each and every day/night that she come to her senses. Sometimes, our kids need to learn leasons on their own. She is living at home, going to comm.college and will be transfering this fall. She is studing to be a criminal investigator...go figure.  Good luck!|`|lAbW0klGaa	you sound like a terrible mother!|`|VxHvIVWoaa	Open it up to your daughter that there is this drug thing you don't like to your daughter's husband to be but of course you have to dealt with her nicely in so that she will understand what you are emphasizing to her. Tell her also that her age tells her to become mature and should consider many things specially the marriage and if she really love her boyfriend, then, there's nothing you can do but to respect her decision. In that way, you show to her how much you love your daughter and how much you are concern to her future. If the boy is really positive to illegal substance, i suggest to send him to a rehab for a cure.
S9p8E8hBaa	I think it depends on if you are happy. Honestly, most of my friends cheat or have cheated. Then they feel bad and stay with their husband. I have always been a cheater. I hate to admit that, but I don't think I will find someone ever who I am satisfied with enough not to want to cheat. If I do I will marry him and be happy. I don't want to be this way. The temptation gets the best of me. Also, these people who say to get better friends that that everyone doe not cheat. They are right, but my girlfriends are attorney's, a vet, a dental asst. and a business owner and we are best friends. We all have cheated and if you feel like you want too then something is missing in your marriage or relationship. But if it were me. I would cheat. Its who I am. Guess I am a pig.|`|jXWhmVGMaa	Yes there are alot of people that are its just one of those things!  you dont know if they did or did not! thats why you have to trust people or you have nothing!! i cheated on a couple girls i did not  love them im engaged now to a girl i could not bring myself to cheat  bacuse i love her!!|`|63182a697a4b26fbf3debd354407a009aa	I'm being pressured to cheat too.  I'm not married but I've been in a relationship for several years now and want to marry my boyfriend.  This person (not my boyfriend) tells me that he doesn't see the point of marriage and calls it outdated among other things and says that I should "just have fun".  I am thinking that he doesn't think to highly of committed relationships altogether.    Before I met my current boyfriend, I might have been more tempted but that was then.  I have no intentions of cheating on him.|`|rm1oLtNtaa	There are more cheaters than we know of...  I can honestly say.. I have been cheated on and have cheated on someone  ..  ( all have long stories)..  My hubby, (we have been married 6 yrs).... has been married 2 other times and has cheated on both of his other wives...     Do I think he will cheat on me?  Not sure.. but the thought is always in the back of your mind... And would I cheat on him....  Not sure  We love each other very much..     I agree there  is so much temptation out there, either younger or older... married or single ... that just want a piece..     I know of a person .. married 45 yrs... as far as I know, never cheated... but has been tempted to the dark side...   So It can happen even if you are not looking for it..|`|rx20pKgOaa	I am faithful and everyone I know is also.  I wonder if you don't need some better friends.      Really - not everyone cheats. At least, not those of us who are married and want to stay that way.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Some of us are. Tell the person that is pressuring you that you are not interested and to go away. If he persists, tell him that he is going to have one angry husband after him shortly.|`|W0XoDxJraa	I'm faithful. My boyfriend is faithful. Of course it is natural to flirt, but some areas of my body, mind and heart are meant for my man alone.    But I do agree, society is getting worse.  A former close friend of mine has had four serious relationships.... and cheated on three of the four.   It isn't good.|`|yyDvNEJ8aa	If you really are satisfied in your relationship then why should you cheat?  Everyone else is just fake if their cheating on their spouse.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Not everyone cheats. If you cheat and he finds out you may mess up his mind for the rest of his life. Dump him rater than cheat.|`|5ViTUTyZaa	I am faithful because I am 9 months pregnant.|`|ujos2q6oaa	yes i am..  pressured to cheat thats a new one  you should have a mind of ur own and no what moral expectations you should uphold|`|XzCDLKOdaa	Well you are hanging around cheaters and losers. That just means you are attracted to cheaters and losers for some reason, but not everyone cheats. Most who cheat are pathetic losers with no life and no reason to live, their only enjoyment is when someone is making their privates feel good. Do you want to be a pig like that?|`|lj2tpz46aa	i am faithful hmm give me a shot lol anyways just live your own life hun and you will be fine dont worry about others lives
f9crUDTwaa	Why do women put up with this kind of crap ... divorce him ... he'll have to pay alimony to you and child support for three children ... It may teach him not to mess with his next wife .
NR6y68U3aa	If you don't want to mess up your friendship then stay friends without benefits.  If you want him as your boyfriend don't mess that up either by giving in to him.  Sexual relationships are not for single people.  You can show that you can for him in other ways.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Next time, don't put all of them in cap locks.  I think this guy likes you.|`|LgZZ46tTaa	i think u should talk to him if not u never gonna know and u don't have to tell him that u love him or care about him just that u miss him  if his intelligent his gonna take the hint u know that u want something more besides ur friend relationship with him i hope all goes right for you and ur friend and if not girl his loss lol
9NniKJcEaa	Oh god! that happened to me in the 6th grade... About the crying thing, yeah remember how she does it for attention!!! So ignore and tell her to wipe the snot off her face and then she'll start crying more... But u shouldn't leave ur good friends for some pathetic stuck-up Dweeb! thats not fair to u or to them! Just start sitting with them again. JUST DO IT!!! It's going to make her feel bad, and of course their the "Why are U mad At me?!?!' and the tears and the rumors. Tell her that ur not mad at her and that u just want to sit wit ur other friends for that day (and do the same the next day) and when she starts crying tell her that there is no reason to cry unless she is doing it for attention. and when she starts telling rumors IGNORE THEM!! Just laugh them off and never sit with her, talk to her, be with her. and if u don't want to play mean, then u can talk to her nicely and explain that u don't like her telling lies about ur friends and u also would like to be able to sit with ur other friends once in a while. from the sound of it ur going to have to pry her gently away! but u shouldn't have to be miserable with her, u should enjoy ur school year with ur friends, ur GOOD friends, so just tell her in a nicer way wat u told us. Or u could just do it the mean way. Its over faster.I'm sorry I just don't like those kind of girls. 6th grade was my WORST year ever.lol.
lb7exqUgaa	yea you said the right thing. she is in denial. try talking to her again and bring up the point you just brought up such as he visited here before and didnt even bother calling her up or anything. how can he love her when he just sleeps with her. that to me is no relationship at all.|`|zqiOlo3caa	that was the right thing to say for sure. you are just worried about your friend. it is a good thing that you are able to tell her how you feel. if you guys are good friends then im sure she will forgive you. the reason she is mad at you is probably because you are right and she doesn't want to admit it to you. im sure things will work out. she may not take your advice in the end but at least she will know how you feel.
lFQiiR0Baa	Talk to her and see what happens.  Maybe it is just a misunderstanding.|`|sC0jiUYDaa	Well...Have you ever talked to her about it? You can! And to be her friend again, all you have to do is to hang out with her. I hope this helps!
tOdjjeAmaa	I met my husband when I was 14. It's been a long and sometimes difficult road for us though... We had a baby when I was 18 and got married when I was 19. We were broken up during my pregnancy and until my baby was 11 months old. My advice? Don't get too serious, too quickly. I dropped out of high school right before my senior year and did not have the average college experience. You have only been dating for 4 months, and your emotions will likely rule your better judgement. I'm not saying you'll get pregnant like I did at 17, I'm saying that the emotional aspect of it- jumping in when you're 15 and "knowing" your boyfriend is "the one" is kind of silly. Just HAVE FUN. Why rush things? Why try to see into the future? At your age you NEED to live in the moment. It's part of growing and learning. Getting serious that young hindered me from a lot and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I love my husband to death, but there is no denying we made a lot of mistakes at first, one of them getting way too serious.|`|1l04qpOKaa	I was 25 when I met him and 27 when we married. Theres always a possibility for you guys but are so young! If I were u I would want to explore the others guys out there. When I was 15 I wanted to marry my boyfriend then but when I look back I think to myself, What was I thinking?? He's not even that cute! Your taste will change and so will other things about yourself so you never know.  :o)|`|yuGW9AlCaa	I think you are thinking way too much into things.    You are only 15 and have only been dating for 4 months.    Just enjoy your time together.. if it is meant to be .. it will.. if not, you'll move on.|`|4y1R8DoWaa	You are wayyyyy too young to be thinking about getting marriage. Trust me.  I found my husband at age 21 and married at 22.  But, I had had many relationships before that and knew what I was looking for.  Don't rush into marriage.|`|2ebd8c899f6ffcd59a224386f106fbcaaa	The first time... 20, the second time... 24. Needless to say, I have been divorced for a year and a half.  As you are only 15, you have your whole life ahead to find Mr Right.  And surely don't be settling for Mr Right Now.  There are so many things you should be doing and seeing.  Since you've only been dating this guy for 4 months, don't be in such a big rush.  Take your time, enjoy life, get to know him a lot more.|`|F0rbWQL8aa	To answer your question, I was 18 when I "found" my husband and we went on our first date on my 19th b-day and married before my 20th birthday.  We have been almost always happily married nearly five years.    At 15, I don't think you need to be focusing on the possibility of a serious relationship.  Instead, you need to focus on the things you like about your boyfriend and the things you don't like.  If you keep a list of the things you do and do not like in guys in your head, it will help you to find someone that would be a great match.  I found that each new boyfriend I had treated me better than the prior boyfriend.  My men kept improving until I found ultimate success in my husband.|`|J3erdQCIaa	19 when I met him, 26 and still married to him....Yippee!!|`|WCA1DOcWaa	I was 24 when I found her.. will marry at 27 :)|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I was 24, a month away from turning 25.  He was 32, 2 months away from turning 33.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	It's possible but improbable. Enjoy your relationships for what they are, not for what they may or may not become in the future. Even if you don't marry your current b/f (which is the most likely scenario), it is still possible to have fun in this relationship and cherish it while it lasts.    I met my first husband when I was 17, my 2nd when I was 21 and my 3rd (and current) when I was 30. Just because my previous relationships are over now doesn't make them any less special or any less valuable. Each was special in its own right. Your relationship is special not because you're going to be together forever (most times, you're not), but because you are together now.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	I am going to tell you a story:    Once upon a time, there was a Little 8 Ball who fell in love.  She was 15 years old.  She grew up and married her Prince 8 Ball Charming.  They had Baby 8 Balls.  Today is her birthday.  She is 32 and is in her Happily Ever After.    That 8 Ball was me.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	I was 20 when we met. We married at 26.   The guys I dated when I was 15, 17, and 19 were not the one for me. I was very in love with my first bf at 15 too. Just take it slow honey. Lots of life ahead of you.

e43hjVI6aa	Awh, I am sorry about all this. I know this is a horrible time for you. No, you are not cursed sweetie! Everything happens for a reason, and it's not just a coincidence that all these bad things are happening at the same time right now.

I like doing little things for my husband as a reminder of how much he means to me.     - I write him short love letters and mail them to his office. I like to spray them with a little bit of my perfume.   - When I find old photos of us together, I scan them and e-mail them to him. Usually with a line like, "Look at the smile on my face, it's because I'm so in love with you. You make me so happy, Baby!"  - Since he wakes up before I do to get ready for work, the night before I leave little notes for him telling him how much I love him in the kitchen by the coffee maker or on the dash of his car.  - I call him during the say just to remind him that I love him and let him know he's on my mind.   - Sometimes I bring him lunch at work, it's even better when he has a little bit of time and we can eat together.   - Whenever I find an online article that reminds me of him or is funny I send it to him. I hope it makes him realize just how much I think about him throughout my day.   - The easiest, and best thing to do, is just to wrap your arms around him, give him a big kiss, and say "Honey, I love you so much!"    Hope this helps!!|`|NrwJyffxaa	Here is a different way other then the 2 or 3 that the other 20 people have said.  Write him a letter and list the great things about him. Go into depth and take time doing it. Then don't just hand it to him mail it to him. Unless your poor with words you should have no problem making it 2-3 pages. This will truly show him that you do love him.    It will last longer and mean more then a one night get away or romp.|`|vLgbjmI2aa	Aww that is great and i feel the exact same way about my husband.Awesome to see someone else feels that way about their spouse.I do different things everyday for him just so he knows that i still love him very much and appreciate him very much.Some things people will probably think is silly but they are the little things that he likes and appreciates.I cook him his favorite meal atleast 3x a week.The other 2 days we let the kids pick.When i go grocery shopping i buy all the little snacks and treats that he likes.He is a chocolate lover so last week when he came home i bought a little basket and filled it with hershey kisses and recees.(His fav.)He loves crossword puzzles so i usually buy him a new one everytime his other is about to run out.(i can keep tabs on it pretty easy since it sits on the shelf by the toilet lol) I still buy him flowers on a weekly basis and vice versa.I buy cards and make them.I have a computer program where you make your own and usually give him a card once a week just to remind him of how much i love him and what he means to me.  We have movie night 2x a week and get whatever new movie is out that he wants to see.We cuddle on the couch and that is best part.I also have some great scented oils that i buy that he likes and give him a fabulous foot massage after he gets home from work.You can come up with lots of things to make them and keep them happy.He does the same for me.It goes both ways.He is the love of my life and i plan on spending the rest of my life showing him just how much i really appreciate him.|`|yB60U4Hxaa	blokes like; food, drink, sex, food and sex.    other than that just participate in something he enjoys doing. we love it when their interests are shared with the people we love.|`|b47814ae0f000f6cc84d1528c810d76aaa	Spend more time with him, get yo *** off the computer!!!!!

If he's that great, don't let him forget it.  Read Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands by Dr. Laura Schlessinger.|`|C7THL8hlaa	make him a film documentary about your love, like with pictures and interview loved ones about your love! or take sexy pictures of yourself and make it into a calendar!|`|63499b9aac8c6b496fd06a307e032485aa	Don't overdo it girl!!!!  You could make him a little naucious!!!! After all, I think he knows it already cos you married him didn't you!!

Good luck|`|MHwn4Tlzaa	Send him a package to his office / work that has new stiletto heels, stockings, garter belt, g-string, corset, etc.  Also put a note in the package of what you are going to do to him in the lingerie.  Write him a very explicit note!  He will rush home that day!|`|q2hq1jr2aa	watch playboy tv or something with him, it will show that you like watching porn, havnt got a clue what he will think,   also, make a porno and post it on the internet|`|sn0V6bXAaa	Toss his salad.|`|BEMviRqeaa	****/protistute time do it all night|`|2QvImMIxaa	don't do that--he knows-trust me-bless you|`|1epjqrflaa	Be freaky in the bedroom, tell him you will do ANYTHING he wants, and do it.|`|zpb4HU7xaa	Cook him a nice meal. And don't argue with him and don't tell him what he's done wrong.
wNr9PChkaa	i think your friends are right. getting involved with him again, especially if he's still in a gang could be bad. say you started dating again or whatever and he gets locked up again? i can imagine that would make it even harder. letting go would be my advice, i know its not easy though. i think counseling would help=]
fHfVRcqbaa	Having sex with another man will not change your wife's ovulation cycle.|`|rm1oLtNtaa	You might be over reacting... a womans period (if not on the pill) can change from month to month.. some longer or shorter than others...    YOu should be lucky if your the one that turns her on..     Longer periods could mean a lot of things..   You didnt say how old she is ?   She could be starting the change..    Talk to her and go see a doctor if she needs too.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	30 days without sex will not cause this.  "Rough sex" will not cause this.  Periods can fluctuate due to stress levels (and it isn't talked about much, but it's true).  Periods can also fluctuate due to hormonal changes.  One abnormal period is not a big deal.    BTW:  What man does this?  lol|`|dRUgXlOLaa	Many things can affect a woman's cycle.  The seasons, her contact with other female friends and to some extent the act of climaxing.  i think the bigger problem is your trust level for her.  You will drive yourself crazy with the speculation.  If you can't trust her and are not willing to go through the rebuild process, then leave her.  If will give you a better peace of mind and allow you you to sleep at night versus looking for proof of her infidelity.|`|BhlGe0A8aa	Maybe she took the morning after pill?|`|f6YsGOynaa	Going out with your friends does NOT cause your period to come early.  Having rough sex does not cause your period to come a week early.      Still, if she's out without you until 3:45 a.m., there's more to the story. If you're trying to work things out, why did you agree to her going out without you?  If I were you, I'd put the lockdown until I trusted her and she'd better stick by it or else find a new place to live.|`|2Xw4Tm0Taa	That's a ridiculous allegation you have there.    Go educate yourself about the menstrual cycles of women before you go off half-****** accusing your wife of cheating because her period was different than it usually is.|`|IocgFjr2aa	Rough sex can't make a period come faster. Ugh get an education.|`|QXRrJPHqaa	this has nothing to do with your relationship issues --- a period can come at different times... no it does not mean at all that she had sex and thats why, you are very paranoid and sound like you need help. you are way over-analyzing. wow!|`|49We7buoaa	Having too much or too little sex does not and will not affect your wife's monthly period, I know your worried about her seeing another man, but you can not read that much into it will just drive you crazy....... Your either have to accept it and get over it or leave her....because being suspicious of everything she says or does is not a life for either one of you!!!    Good Luck :-)|`|5ajPMlrqaa	Stress can change a woman's cycle.  If a woman has an eating disorder or is malnourished, that can cause her to miss a period or stop having periods.  As another writer mentioned, contraception can influence her menstrual cycle.  The really important part here though is that you suspect she's cheating - why don't you just speak to her about that?|`|qBHjIrVHaa	Sex doesn't affect your period.  Unless it causes a pregnancy.  Bleeding from trauma, tears shouldn't last that long.  Going without doesn't change your hormones, she doesn't get that from you.      All women have an occasional irregular cycle.   Premenstrual symptoms can vary also.   Stress can cause physical symptoms, especially gastric, but also a cycle.       Unless she recently miscarried, that could cause abnormal bleeding.  You've known her pregnant before, any symptoms?    Worried about STDs, then ask your wife to get tested with you.     Now, if a woman is used to keeping herself a certain 'way', then she does it for herself, not to please someone else.       You have every right to require she stop all contact with this other man if her relationship was inappropriate.     Seek some couples counseling to help you both strengthen your relationship.   She maybe dealing with guilt issues.  It takes time to deal with a betrayal and lots of effort from both.
vyNlyfczaa	it sounds like my husband's mom....he thinks he is so special, so great and if he would be a little bit better he would be saint...(where he is a great guy! don't get me wrong - he doesn't go out, doesn't drink or smoke!) but the way how he thinks just kills me! (he thinks that every single fight what we ever had was my fault - because he is so perfect).  Try talk to your wife! ask her to limit a little bit the 'sweetness' - tell your son how sweet, good, special he is - but have some limits!  The only fights what we have with my hubby is about him being so sensitive - that he is always right, no matter what!|`|y21VcTjDaa	You sound like a jealous father to me...how sad.|`|pma90Xycaa	I think it's very important for a child to feel loved and supported by his parents.  It's true that the rest of the world won't necessarily feel that way, but your 3-year-old will find out soon enough how "unspecial" he is.  :-(  Because none of us are special at all.  No matter who we are and what we do, there is always someone else out there who can do it better than we can.      Since he's involved in all those other extracurricular activities, he'll find out very soon that he's not special to the point that everyone should fall at his feet as he passes them on the street.  He'll learn teamwork and how to appreciate the art of others.|`|JZjE1K9Baa	I think it sounds like she is doing her best to be the best mother she can be.  If the way she goes about it is different than I would or someone else would it doesn't really matter.  Your child is loved and well taken care of.  Much more than lots of children have.|`|gfHutvEFaa	It's always good to start your child out with high self esteem. Life will come at him fast enough.    I don't get it though. You want your wife to tell him how stupid he is, how ugly he is and how cruel and mean he is??    Just don't go overboard. Make sure he loses at things too, that way he knows that even if you lose sometimes, doesn't mean your a "loser".|`|qXCSWQpdaa	Other than my opinion is she has picked the wrong man to be her husband and the father of her child, yes. I think she is doing a fine job.|`|CGt4CKPfaa	it does sound like she is going overboard.  After a while, these words will seem meaningless to your child.  She can certainly praise him for more than normal good things... but that really sounds like too much of a good thing.    Kids today are in TOO many activities... I think for a 3-year old, ONE activity is enough. They just want to play!    I agree with you...|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	The classes sound a bit advanced for a 3 year old. But, if he isn't complaining and is okay in them, you may not push it for right now. I believe it won't hurt to tell the special people in your life that they are special every single day. We never know when that might be the last day they see us. She might want to back off on the sweet and cute, and just tell him how much she loves him at bedtime or something.|`|cLPimVR6aa	What is wrong with telling your child how specail he is and posting his selfsteam. A lot children don't have that and no matter what they do as an adult they think is never right so they turn to be pschos, and killers. Thank God you have a wife who is a great mom.
8HnLYjK4aa	you feel guilty because you think your mom should know.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	what the hell it got to do with you been the son ... you dad need a kick up the *** ,tell your mother|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Uhm...    How does being a better son change a mans behavior?  He isn`t married to you, right.    And, anyways, you cannot force someone to cheat. That is completely, 100% and totally his own choice and responsibility.    Don`t blame yourself, or anyone but your dad, for this behavior.|`|vqdNEtYPaa	I think you already know that his affair has nothing to do with you.  It isn't about you being a good or bad son.
fGE7hL12aa	It sounds to me like you don't want to be married to the guy you were dating. It would be naive of you to think he will change very much.|`|MgiGZ51Zaa	I believe that you have every reason to feel hurt. Honestly it sounds like you've made a lot of effort to make this relationship work, but his co-operation is zero...  what i can tell you is that he will not change...you deserve someone much better than him...    and also, you should speak to a counsellor about how you're feeling...its not good to keep this depression to yourself..|`|qXCSWQpdaa	No.    But you are wrong for thinking you ever were going to be able to change him.
HWnhBCXiaa	Personality and our reception of someone dictate beauty much more than anything else. Men often view the same women differently depending on their feelings towards them.  Sociologically when you first experience passionate love and enter a state of didactic with-drawl  you look beyond glaring mistakes and focus only on the positive. Physiologically your body is flooded with chemicals that make you more happy and accepting.     But once things sour your negative emotions focus on what isn't great about that person.  Its all about perspective.  One of my relationships started with me finding the woman hideous, but as things progressed she slowly became the most beautiful girl in the world.      It's personality that dictates how we see someone.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	That is very sad.  You can have that feeling back, but you both need to work at it.  Get some counseling or have the decency to leave him before you do something stupid.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	This is drastic and you've stayed too long.  lol|`|i1rDJY2aaa	He's ugly to you because you have seen the ugly person that he is on the inside.|`|vLgbjmI2aa	That is very sad.I do know what you mean though.That is when you know its time to leave and move on.Best of luck|`|VWsH7Ca1aa	maybe you failed to see the REAL person that he was. You were more than likely wearing your rose colored glasses. Attitude is everything. If your boyfriend had a sucky attitude, that can make him unapealing.|`|tsPGVVWcaa	Once you tend to find a flaw in someone the attraction seems to dwindle downward. Alot of it has to do personality people can be really ugly on the inside and once that has been exposed you tend to loose interest. :(|`|AA10150827	Yes Girl ! You're not the only one. For a female- the person they fall in love with is the most amazing person to them. His eyes, his smell, his smile.. everythinggg.. and once you fall out of love- you start to notice all the flaws and blemishes he talked about before lol.. and you're turned off.. and ughhh! Yes gurl.. I know the feeling!|`|3rBYqlCJaa	the guy is probably ugly cuz of what he did to you...i kno wat it feels likee!!  Best of Luckk!!|`|KukyXRjpaa	damn this is harsh, im a guy and i have been with my girl for quite some time, and she has changed drastically, like gained weight, but i wouldnt leave her or fall out of love. beauty is also from within, you know. dont be so shallow. alot of these comments from girls, just prove how shallow females are.     everyone gets ugly one day, no one looks 25 forever!
MX1shAbcaa	Yeah.. you should be mad at her... But i think you  should talk to through with her.  Best of luck~William
JoVjSpc3aa	as he is on a benefit, they will only take a tiny chunk of that for maintenance. check with the child support agency (or whatever its called now) but im pretty certain to say, hes right, and if your not on benefits already, you can claim income support and child tax credits.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Yeh you need to apply for Child Tax Credit, get a form from the jobcentre and fill it in. The sooner you do this the sooner you will get what you are entitled to and they will date it from the day they receive your claim.  Good luck.|`|KO4Ea9Xkaa	As your ex is on benefit then that sounds pretty accurate to me. I'm assuming that you are claiming tax credits, so you need to inform them that your income has dropped considerably. If your working, and your hours are above 16 a week then you will not be entitled to income support. If you are not, then you can claim income support as a lone parent until your youngest child turns 7 (this is going to change at some point though) and also housing benefit/local housing allowance to cover the cost of your rent, and council tax benefit. See these websites, which should be able to tell you more......    www.entitledto.co.uk    www.direct.gov.uk    www.hmrc.gov.uk/taxcredits    Just a quick EDIT to those who are berating this woman for having kids she 'can't afford'...how was she supposed to know she would find herself in this situation, that her relationship would fail and her ex would have to give up work? From the sounds of things, before all of this occurred she and her ex COULD afford to have their children without needing government handouts, so give her a break! She's asking for advice, not a lecture from the moral high ground!|`|d55f9fa303ffed7693f24381e6799502aa	Join the club, my Ex husband went on permanent sick and our 3 sons have had no money off him at all for over 3 years. CSA told me he doesn't have to pay if he has stopped working. I know how annoyed you feel cos I feel the same.|`|Ot1R3t5uaa	check with the dss,they should ensure you have adequate funds to live on....... on the other hand,i have been on the receiving end of the csa and they are a ruthless bunch of bas**rds who just see pound signs. they **** it up for both parents,by demanding ludicrous amounts of money,which then forces the father to "lose his job".|`|BhlGe0A8aa	It seems you have a lot of children.  I would expect that the CSA will probably help you sort this mess out.  Do not have kids if you cannot afford to support them.|`|84sEpgEPaa	While he is on benefits his assessment will only be 5. The government will not make up your loss of maintenance.  Child maintenance from an ex is never guaranteed and you will only receive what has been assessed based on his income.    I take it that you are on benefits yourself as a full time mum? If so then you are entitled to receive full benefits and up to 20 a week of what he pays. If he was giving you the full amount and your benefit was being reduced accordingly then you can contact the job centre to let them know you are now only getting the 5 a week so that you get your full benefit entitlement.    If you have been receiving full benefits as well as 48 a week from him then you were receiving more than you were entitled to anyway as your benefit should have been reduced by the extra 28 a week you were getting.    At the end of the day, he is living off state benefits and the tax payer are funding his living, but then they are also funding yours and having children does not give you the given right to hand outs from tax payers and your ex for the rest of your life. You both have a responsility to financially support your children but it sounds like it is the workers who have paying for both you, your ex and your children.|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Well you should not have filed for divorce. Men no longer take it up the butt "for the good of zhe children". No more Mr. nice guy.|`|FjFAEvzcaa	the whole lot stinks... more reason for work-shy blokes to sit around on their backsides|`|AA11104372	If he's not working, he can watch the kids while you work.  You two made these kids, it's your responsibility to raise them.
