My three meet a lot of York University students as the Uni and campus are close to where there homes are and they still socialise a lot in the city and the consensus of opinion is that labour are going to be whitewashed at the next election and that people will not waste votes on the liberals to ensure that labour go and so will vote Conservative with a capital C.

claUGpVRaa	Well as an average - full time is approx 40 hours, so halve it I would say for a rough guide. If you got paid the higher rate approx ￡8791 per annum so divide by 12 and approx ￡732 per month before tax and NI is deducted.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a bit! Depends what the company consider full time hours of course,  but a rough guide for you|`|AA11376570	divide by 12 then divide by 160(taking that its a 40hour week ) then times 84|`|OGLOz9VUaa	A normal working week is based on 40hrs so do 40/21 = 2.1. Then 16,389/2.1+￡7804<br>  Hope this helps!

People think we have an open door policy<br>  ,and wander in and out of the UK as though it belonged to them. If you go to Australia you have to have the correct documents, like I did while going on a visit. That applies to nearly every Country, apart as I said the UK, where everyone is allowed through the doors, and never return from whence they came. We are bursting at the seams, but still more come, and why do you ask... well one of the reasons is that they get handouts, from day one, and there on after. Is that a good enough reason ? We Brits do not think so as we had to work for ours.|`|gPvOcB6oaa	What I find amazing is that they actually deported him, has he never heard the of the word "asylum"....that normally guarantees you a welfare cheques every week|`|S8RL9lieaa	It only goes to show that if you didn't have bad luck you'd have no luck at all.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	lol that was a bit of bad luck, shame|`|GOpQsYHUaa	Immigrants eh?<br>  And what about the poor aussie whose job you are going to snaffle????<br>  <br>  Late?

hZjPYyFTaa	I worked at a national paper of record in business journalism for 25 years. Every story, feature or investigative piece was done with the utmost professionalism, accuracy and fairness. When covering stories that were incriminating or sensitive to our corporate interests good or bad - there was even more pressure to make sure journalistic integrity was maintained. A reporter and or editor could lose their job if the facts weren't correct.<br>  It meant working late up to the last moment while as many as 6 editors and a law firm scrutinized every detail. News organizations can lose their credibility if their reporting is compromised. Columnists and editorial writers have slightly different agendas then hard news.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aldaily.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aldaily.com/</a><br>  The left side of the screen has links to the top newspapers, magazines, columnists, services and journals in every area.<br>  I used to read the NY Times as my regular newspaper but have shifted to The Guardian UK.|`|I5SypMlsaa	not really thats the whole point of the news... to brain wash people|`|BYg26Mggaa	not really cnn is pretty good but fox sux

Hubby and i are going to Aus. in a few weeks to a 40th birthday party for our two friends who recently emigrated and they have been researching properties for us in Perth and Sydney where they own homes. If there is any danger of labour getting in at the next election, we're off, all eight of us, we won't give any more to this country if the vote is for labour as they've destroyed so much already and they're not having what we have worked so damned hard for over the last forty years to simply waste on the undeserving. Even as a 'pensioner' i'm having to pay 40% tax on an income from money i have already paid tax on! I'd rather build it into a new country where our children could have a decent life style without all the abuses this rotten government place on their shoulders.|`|YxwA5sjwaa	No jokes please.

4OLpe1Ylaa	I feel bad as well and that's a very good thing in today's callous world. I don't even like football and have never heard of these young men. They are strong and tough and we think that nothing can harm them. I have a healthy respect for the ocean. it is treacherous out there when the weather kicks up, the wind, the cold. Very tragic.<br>  <br>  I heard the grandfather of young Cooper talk about how their faith in God will see then thru no matter what happens. He said that Cooper grew up in a Christian home and was growing so in the faith. He was hopeful but knew that the news could be bad.<br>  <br>  It's ok to be upset. You are human and caring.|`|7c6a4c897130f7c3fc309fad2d122efcaa	I don't know why you're so sad about this, but it bothers me as well.  Maybe it's disturbing because they were all strong, young men with everything going for them just out for a good day fishing.  Who knows?  I feel sad seeing their families.  It's always sad when people die like this, even sadder when a positive proof of death is never had.  As a parent one would always keep looking and keep hoping.  I wish for a good outcome of this.|`|0NcRUSCoaa	It is because you have a good soul.  You are big hearted and are capable of having sympathy towards others.

qKdQpZ5Kaa	The most important thing if you have kids, is not to paint too negative a picture of the future or be fatalistic.  Tell them that the important thing is that you stick together as a family and look out for each other.|`|jER0X5OPaa	My family is pretty frugal and save a lot of our money, nor have my parents lost their jobs or come upon some other misfortune, so we haven't been hugely affected by the recession.<br>  <br>  I suggest:<br>  <br>  => Look at ads and coupons. Know which stores have the best deals on foods. You can save so much money from this. My family goes to three different grocery stores to get the best deals.<br>  =>If you eat out a lot, stop. Eat in, make your own meals. Again, you save a lot.<br>  =>Save when you can. If you are able to save money, do it. That way, in case something unexpected happens, you've got some extra money to help you get by.<br>  =>Buy generic. Generic food, generic clothes. Generic is always cheaper than name brands, and usually just as good.<br>  =>Instead of going out with your friends, stay in. Have your friends over at your place, and have them do the same. <br>  =>Carpool.|`|zAhlNl6oaa	Well if you are...on the HEFTY side-and 80% of Americans are-now may be good time to go on a diet (winking smiley here)...nad save some of that hard to come by "green",..or better yet-stop eating all together- you and your whole family-for a week, it will save you "Mo`e Green", and your kids & gramps will get the feeling of what`s it like for millions of starving people in the world.
z8Euv8xKaa	I think it's fishy too.  Especially when the survivor said they removed their vests and drifted away.  I find that very very strange.<br>  He also had a lot of muscle damage and claim he got it banging into the boat.  I think there was an altercation.  Stay tuned.|`|4OLpe1Ylaa	You obviously have never been in rough water out on the ocean. The boat is small and bobbing up and down like a cork. The wind is fierce, it's cold.

zvHC8Wy1aa	ABSOLUTELY! There really is no reason for her not to. She murdered her 2 year old daughter, and shows NO remorse whatsoever! For what reason should she be allowed to live after she has taken the life of her two year old? Caylee can no longer live and breathe, why should Casey? Especially after the chain of events that took place after her death! It makes me sick knowing that just hours after she killed her own daughter she went out partying and drinking, taking wild pictures and laughing having a good time... and where was Caylee?? In the trunk of her car, wrapped in a trash bag with duct tape over her mouth???!!!<br>  <br>  It sickens and terrifies me to even try and fathom the last moments of Caylees life. Was she awake? Was she asleep? Did she struggle? Did she look her mother in straight in the eye in pain and agony and wonder why her own mommy was doing this and how come her grandparents werent there to help her... its so sick and heartbreaking. I couldnt even say how many times I have cried over this child that I have never met, just because I could never even imagine having someone do this to me. Someone that I love with all of my heart, and look up to. This person that had given me a life to live surrounded by people who love me. Then just taking it away with pleasure out of pure jealousy, and feeling completely satisfied from this. Casey should die.<br>  I never thought that I would say anything like that, but I believe that Casey is evil! Really. And its not like she will be executed the following week after the conviction, she will have to wait in prison for years maybe, knowing that she will be executed. I think it totally fair. I think that there needs to be a voice for little Caylee Anthony and I think that she deserves justice. She took the life of and innocent 2 year old girl, her own daughter at that! It made her feel powerful and strong. Its just so wrong and so unfair. <br>  <br>  I truly believe that she alone committed this heinous crime and that she should suffer the consequences. <br>  RIP sweet Caylee|`|QEUHqTIPaa	i didnt like ya face one day i SNAPPED just like THAT i dicided to strike BACK u got me MAD i snapped ya NECK put a whole in ya HEAD brake yo arms and LEGS in HALF ull end up beign DEAD and ill never REGRET for doing THAT cuz iam the BEST iam crzazy my rhymes are sicker then JAYZYZZ i do get LADIES my life is like a soundtrack even when i was close to defeat i still roll the BEAT cant u see iam the grillest ILLEST my stone is da CHILLEST got homes and VILLES.

She'll feel the effects of isolation and loneliness.   Also, I think that the fact that she has no criminal history plays a part in my thinking.  Don't get me wrong, I am not a Casey Anthony fan!|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	If founded Guilty then Yes, If found Not Guilty let her go, she'll be like OJ Commit a Crime under pressure and end up back in jail for Robbery, No need for an execution.
mg6gAfwYaa	US indirectly supports terrorism by giving billions of dollars in aid to Pakistan, although US knows very well that Pakistan is a rogue state that provides refuge to terrorists of all hues. It will not be before long that Pakistan goes completely into the hands of a terrorist regime, and that would be the time when US will have to intervene just like they did in Iraq. India on the other hand is a very soft state who goes around with a begging bowl to US for support against terrorism. Pakistan has outsmarted India through their clever diplomacy and the world already seems to be forgetting about the 26/11 massacre in Mumbai. India is also unfortunate to be ruled by corrupt and short sighted political rulers who are incapable of securing the life and liberty of Indian citizens. The bumbling and inefficient politicians of India are a national shame. People in India would continue to die at the hands of terrorists unless Indian people bring in a new dynamic leadership, which seems impossible during the current scenario. India today is in a lose-lose situation because the politicians are corrupt and they keep appeasing minorities for votes. The Muslim minorities are also largely responsible to provide refuge and help to terrorists in India. India is truly a soft, corrupt and directionless country and whatever prosperity we find as far as our foreign exchange reserves are concerned is due to the brain power of young computer software professionals of India.|`|80fWQyDnaa	America thinking itself oversmart. It thinks itself as the only super power. It created Osama Laden for its own vested interest. Now Osama is hunting America. Now all the americans sleep in fear and uncertainity. America also made friendship with Pakistan for the reason best known to itself. America knew very well what Pak is doing with its aid. But the aid continued. Now Pakistan ****ed America with the aid. America just ****ing up the whole mankind with its oversmartness . I wonder what the thinktank and intellectuals are doing there. Their economy has been shattered. The unemployment is sky rocketting. Their children are going schools with guns. 90% of **** films are being produced there. People are addicted with drugs ,becoz of depression. The wise men there invented WMD,Global warming. They have made the UN a joke ! And now thinking to attack Iran. They are funding Israel a lot. Where from the money is coming ? Obviously from the pockets of its stupid citizens. Alas ! Those poor americans are now dancing with joy expecting a miracle from Obama ! But Obama cant do anything better. He can not get time. His tenure will be finished just by clearing the bloody mess left by his predecessor. <br>  Sorry friend ! I wrote so much, but I am helpless .|`|Q4fOTUNNaa	it Is the ego of america to be the big boss of the world.

b1XStRqtaa	You do the crime, you do the time. I don't care how old he is.  Kids today have to learn that there are consequences for their actions.  People scoff at those who say there is too much violence on TV and in video games, etc. but look at all these stories coming out now about crimes like this being committed by younger and younger kids.  On TV or a video game you can shoot someone because they look at you funny and that's that.  This is real life sonny jim, you kill someone you pay the price.<br>  <br>  The father is also to blame for teaching his kid about hunting but obviously not about the responsibility of handling a gun, etc.  The father is probably one of those blast away hunters that just go out and shoot things.  There are courses out there to take, at least in my state.  There are rules to follow.<br>  <br>  If guns were outlawed, people would just find other weapons to kill with.  What's next?

How does someone get "accidentally" stabbed 12 times?<br>  <br>  edit: I don't think its fair for you to throw all actors in the same category. From what I've read this young man was coming to the aid of his brother (not an actor) who was in an altercation. When he tried to break up the fight he was stabbed and killed in the process. Not all actors are snobbish pricks.

And also who told you that "the atrocities the top brass has carried out". If the Majors and Colonels are the Top Brass then who what tag would go along the Brigadiers and Major Generals?<br>  <br>  We all know what triggered the August 1975 killing of the then Prime Minister Sk. Mujibur Rahman. The 'collateral damage' occured when the mid-level officers of the Army failed to contain their 'brutal act', the way probably the BDR soldiers possibly did in this time, if the news of foreign involvement is inaccurate which says that about 25 commandos of foreign origin were the master mind on 25th February 2009 killing of unarmed officers who gathered at the Pilkhana as their routine yearly get-together that includes Tattoo Show and Darbar (general meeting of BDR Top Brasses with their soldiers) when the perpetrators killed the Director General (DG) who was a Major General, Dy.DG who was a Brigadier General and 55 other Officers, from Captain to Colonel level.<br>  <br>  Please do not mock the patriotic defence forces when we need some consolation for the bereaved family and for the country as a whole.

8I9uduIiaa	As a Brit, all I can do lately is yell with sheer frustration. Only today, the papers said that Al Jazeera is going to make a bid for Channel 4 TV.<br>  <br>  Britain has lost her backbone - I wrote about this at <a href="http://ajewwithaview.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://ajewwithaview.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  The gutless British government BANNED Dutch MP Geert Wilders - yet recently has allowed in all manner of Islamic terrorists including several Hezbollah organisers.<br>  <br>  Author Douglas Murray got BANNED from a debate that he was invited to CHAIR at the London School Of Economics - because Muslim students threatened to RIOT. So the LSE caved and 'disinvited' Murray.<br>  <br>  Britain is one of the most anti Israel countries around. The British public have, for the most part, swallowed hook, line and sinker the mad notion that the Jews just 'arrived' in Palestine in 1948 - never mind that Palestinian Jews had already BEEN living there for 3000 yrs and were ALREADY the MAJORITY in what became Israel!<br>  <br>  The anti Israel rallies have involved violence against Jews and the British police.<br>  <br>  I predict - and have been saying this for weeks - that if things don't improve, then very soon the Jewish community in Britain will shrink in a big, big way...<br>  <br>  Meanwhile we know that throughout the 90s, London was used as a recruiting ground for several Islamic extremist groups - and Hizbut Tahrir, a group BANNED IN SEVERAL ARAB STATES, are STILL active in Britain!<br>  <br>  At the weekend, a large rally in London featured British Muslims demanding Sharia Law in Britain.<br>  <br>  <br>  Britain - or ANGLOSTAN?<br>  <br>  Watch this space.|`|GOifC7i3aa	it is not britain ....it is our gutless government<br>  <br>  israel is an ally and has been for years<br>  <br>  but since our government is so desperate to court muslim votes in many cities it is pandering to them and putting forward dangerous and foolish policies that keep them happy but endanger the world<br>  <br>  muslims have shown themselves as determined to shape britain's foreign policy ....the focus of this happens to be israel at the moment<br>  <br>  when the government capitulates and cuts israel adrift ...i think it will be the turn of the US to be demonised ....<br>  <br>  the government will not be re-elected ...fortunately <br>  but i sincerely hope their predecessors make decisions that favour the british and europe and the west <br>  <br>  it is a joke that immigrants from the third world are deciding our foreign policy - look at the mess their former countries are in because they make their decisions based on religion<br>  <br>  if this mess is allowed to continue britain will be the western equivalent of pakistan|`|AA10047588	This is stage two of the Islamization of Britain.

That's all I know about England.|`|8cWXhZGjaa	The reason why Britain is starting to become like this is because the country is demographically being overtaken by radical Muslim immigrants. Britain as a democracy is trying to respect the rights of those Muslims in the country. But unfortunately they are being a little bit too culturally open to a point were it is appeasing radical Islam and letting them take control and eroding the very foundation of British democracy within itself.  So yes your right, radical Muslim lobbies are taking over Britain.This is slowly transforming Britain into a Muslim country. They opened separate Sharia courts for Muslims, they started boycotting Israel for the radical Muslims. They are even starting to allow laws were non-Muslims can't enter Muslim communities in London! I have nothing against ordinary Muslims who are not radical and multiculturalism but multiculturalism does not mean allowing a culture to dominate and interfere with the livelihoods of other cultures. What Britain needs to do is to grow a backbone and stop appeasing to radical Islam and  tell radical muslims that don't like British democracy to leave the country while at the same time Britain should remain open to different cultures but know when to draw the line. Also I understand the Israeli the government is not perfect and has done some wrong things but why should Israeli academics suffer for politics? What if an Israeli scientist happened to find a cure for cancer would we boycott the research just because it's in Israel? I can understand the political issues with Israel but why does ordinary Israelis who have nothing to do with the conflict that just want to make the world a better place like other University professors and researchers have to suffer?|`|NMpbLtuTaa	The government I voted for in Canada is in full support of Israel and has stood against the tide of anti-Semitism at the UN. Please don't count the British out yet.

We are in a fight here aren't we?|`|i7oHTo9haa	I'm American. I'm just seeing alot of aggression by the Islamics to "divide and conquer" us.  A united West they can't take us on but if they can get us to abandon our loyalty to each other then they've got it made. Red carpet to Europe with no ally to defend them and then onto America.  I had one guy posing as a Brit in the last 24 hours but then explained to me in email (he emailed me) he was actually French (prob Muslim.) He was trying to denigrate relations between Britain and America. There are so many Muslims out there that I can't counteract their influence on Western mindsets, and since they're already in these countries acting as "friendlies" it's hard to counteract. All I keep doing is to remind our Western allies that we are at war with Islamofascism and not with each other.  We're currently fighting wars on multiple fronts both foreign and domestic.<br>  <br>  If one wants the West to be isolated in the world that is the quickest way to do it. Turning our backs on our allies means exposing ourselves to our enemies with nobody to rely on except ourselves.  If we refuse to fight them does not mean that they refuse to fight us it just means we serve ourselves up into their Islamofascist hands.<br>  <br>  As far as negotiating with Hezbollah or Hamas that is truly craziness.  Hezbollah is taking over Lebanon and Christians used to be a majority there. There are only 1mil Christian Lebanese left with 8million scattered worldwide.  Both Hezbollah and Hamas are terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda, and nobody negotiates with these terrorists. It is not new to Bush/Blair campaign, Reagan/Thatcher was the first duo to fight against terrorism.  We bombed the heck out of Libya and Qadaffi still limps from his emasculating battle wounds.  :)  Now he just talks about "taking things to international court."  We really can win this, but we have to do it with our allies because now there are terrorists everywhere and they are on the move.|`|HBzZqCJ0aa	When one studies Biblical Prophecy the reasons for the actions of nations and individuals is suddenly seen in a clear light. No need to ponder, just see the Bible prophecies reviewed in the headline news.<br>  <br>  Regarding your question, Dark Al, as to why we Brits are behaving in this strange way. How about this - a prophecy from the New Testament!<br>  <br>  2 Tim 3:1-5<br>  3 "You may as well know this too, Timothy, that in the last days it is going to be very difficult to be a Christian. 2 For people will love only themselves and their money; they will be proud and boastful, sneering at God, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful to them, and thoroughly bad. 3 They will be hardheaded and never give in to others; they will be constant liars and troublemakers and will think nothing of immorality. They will be rough and cruel, and sneer at those who try to be good. 4 They will betray their friends; they will be hotheaded, puffed up with pride, and prefer good times to worshiping God. 5 They will go to church, yes, but they won't really believe anything they hear. Don't be taken in by people like that."  TLB<br>  <br>  If you want something specific for the anti Jewish attitudes then:<br>  <br>  Luke 21:11-12<br>  1 And there will be great earthquakes in various places, and famines and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven.  12 But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons.

Hamas has not changed, nor will it. People are terribly deceived if they believe you can negotiate peace with them.<br>  <br>  And now: What sort of relationship is Britain trying to establish with Hezbollah?  Again, I believe our leaders are deceived in this pretense.  Better to work through Israel rather than Hezbollah.<br>  <br>  Did all those brainwashing speeches work? No, not for most of the grassroots people, but the government thinks it knows best.  They're making a terrible mistake.<br>  <br>  A bit more far fetched:  It does seem that way doesn't it? But not yet, at least not so obviously.  The government is very keen on Europe, and being in Europe is doing enough damage.<br>  <br>  As a British folk.  No, I do not support these stances, and do not support terror organisations.

Small enough to be easily portable, able to handle many cutting related tasks, and still very deadly. In fact, according to crime statistics, more deaths occurs from knife wounds than from gun-shot. Knives cause broad, sometimes torn wounds, whereas a bullet is limited (unless it's a large caliber.) Also, no matter what Hollywood says, not many people in a life-or-death struggle will pop out perfect headshots all the time.<br>  <br>    All other melee weapons have limitations. A sword, bat, club, mace, axe, etc, must be swung. While the sword can stab, and is nearly as versitile as a knife, it's size make it a purpose-built weapon.
