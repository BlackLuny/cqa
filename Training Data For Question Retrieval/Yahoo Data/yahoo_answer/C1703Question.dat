20090220082704AAYxydp	News & Events;Current Events	Why did Obama give Palestinians free refuge in the US? What are your thoughts?	I just got this email and I checked the sources...I'm just amazed.       http://www.thefederalregister.com/d.p/20...     http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/E9-24...          Obama Signs Presidential Determination Allowing Palestinians Loyal to Hamas to Resettle In US   President Barack Obama has signed an executive order (presidential determination) allowing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to resettle in the United States.   Sure, what can go wrong when we allow hundreds of thousands of people who have been, as Mark Steyn memorably described, "marinated" in a "sick death cult," who voted for Hamas, and 55% of whom support suicide bombings to live here -- and at the American taxpayers' expense: By executive order, President Barack Obama has   ordered the expenditure of $20.3 million in migration assistance to the Palestinian refugees and conflict victims in Gaza. The "presidential determination" which allows hundreds of thousands of Palestinians with ties to Hamas to resettle in the United States was signed on January 27 and appeared in the Federal Register on February 4.   President Obama's decision, according to the Register, was necessitated by "the urgent refugee and migration needs" of the "victims."   Few on Capitol Hill took note that the order provides a free ticket replete with housing and food allowances to individuals who have displayed their overwhelming support of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in the parliamentary election of January 2006.      Let's review some of Barack Obama's most recent actions since he was inaugurated:      * His first call to any head of state as president was to Mahmoud Abbas, leader of Fatah party in the Palestinian territory.      * His first one on one interview with any news organization was with Al Arabia television.      * He ordered Guantanamo Bay closed and all military trials of detainees halted.   * He ordered all overseas CIA interrogation centers closed.   * He withdrew all charges against the masterminds behind the USS Cole and 9/11.   *He is allowing hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refuges to move to and live in the US at American taxpayer expense.            So...where is our say in all this?      What happened to the US support of Israel?      What about Israeli refugees who have been attacked by Palestinians for years?      Why is he giving them refuge in the US? Doesn't that seem a little far from home?
20090220091825AAbNaHi	News & Events;Current Events	Okay. About this Chris Brown and Rihanna situation.?	So admittedly we have no clue what really went down but I am generally shocked at the people defending him by:   Let me make this clear - not shocked at the defense of him... I'm shocked at people saying that probably she provoked him so that just about makes it right.   I'm not a fan of Rihanna or Chris Brown, and I'm trying look beyond the star power (pfft) here and look at the humanity of the situation.   My question is: (provided that the photos on tmz are not photo shopped)... when is provocation ever justified for doing something like that to a weaker human being?   I don't purport females hitting males either (domestic abuse is domestic abuse)... but let's say she did hit him... how much self control do you have to let go to cause damage like that to someone weaker than you?   It's like a stronger women... literally beating down her weaker boyfriend after he slapped her.   I can't reconcile myself to believe that provocation can act as justification for such an act.   What are your opinions?

An Australian woman has pretended her father had been killed in the recent bush fires to collect a government pay-out, it is claimed.      She had already received A$5,000 (￡2,200) from an official funeral fund, but was trying to con A$10,000 (￡4,400) from a relief fund set up to help victims of the deadly fires.      What a low life! To think of all those families who have lost loved ones, homes and communities.

20090220113819AAOfLiT	News & Events;Current Events	(UK) Are mortgage repossessions a cynical ''stay rich ploy'' by Fat Cat bankers?	Houses are being repossessed at super quick speed despite the government hand wringing and pleading.   Many repossessions are taking place after only one month arrears (according to the Media).      Perhaps there is a chance that Fat Cat Bankers are forcing the repo's so that their agents can buy cheap at the auctions, thus ensuring an income during the fallow years for fat cats (if there is one).      I've just slapped my wrist for being so cynical.

20090220112606AAwAnlC	News & Events;Current Events	Why is Obama releasing that British prisoner from Guantanamo?	What sense does it make to release him free. They should have released him and transported him to a mainland prison.   Apparently, they tortured him until he coughed up a confession, but doesn't mean he had nothing to do with terrorism and Jihad cave dwellers, does it? Not condoning torture but obviously they had to result to that since he wasn't going to admit anything. I mean seriously, i not one of those conspiracy types (before you conspiracy nuts jump in), but what reason would the military have in arrest some total stranger?   The guys guilty, and shouldn't be released. He will either wind up in some islamic terror cell in Britain or back in the jihad groups giving advice and being made a national hero.

20090220112120AAvaLmQ	News & Events;Current Events	Is the statement I'm about to say about war in the mid-east true or false(see below)?	the reason it has become harder for us to fight a war is because Few actual governments are fighting us.Instead we faced with small groups of people who hit and run hiding within the civilian population and wearing the same closes as they do.our government is built to fight governments not civilians. we want to face governments that keep their civilian population as far away from the front lines as possible. To protect them from harm not use them as hostages without them even knowing it.governments that have fixed BOOs(base of operation) and leaders who care of their people & doing whats right for them more then the leaders themselves.I'm saying this because I saw a documentary that with each war America enters more civilians die.That didn't set well with me and as I started thinking about it this popped in my mind.Am I being to simple minded in my thinking or am I right?I hope nobody is offended by what I have wrote and if you think I'm just a other right-wind American nut job I understand.I have never been a soldier or been in war so I don't know if I should be making such a statement.If your from the mid-east and want to call me a simpleton Then do it I will not be mad or hate you.I guess your smarter then me.I just want to know if I'm right or wrong.if U think I'm wrong tell me why & help me learn the true but if I'm right how come I don't hear people saying this?I'm so sorry if I offended anyone I just want to know if what I stated was true or not?Thank you for reading this and may god bless you.Hope to hear your comments.

My Silence Cannot Be Bought   by Beverly Eckert      I've chosen to go to court rather than accept a payoff from the 9/11 victims compensation fund.

I want to know why two 110-story skyscrapers collapsed in less than two hours and why escape and rescue options were so limited.

20090220145127AAdcb0T	News & Events;Current Events	Do you think the media is making the current economic crisis worse?	So is it just me, or does anybody else believe that the whole "new depression" is partially due to the fact that the media has blown it way out of proportion.      Let me first say that I am well aware of the fact that people are losing jobs and taking pay cuts, but people not spending money is somewhat contributed to the fact that the media can't seem to get enough else to talk about.      They are basically scaring people into not spending money which is putting an even bigger weight on the shoulders of the economy.      Anybody else agree with me on this statement?
20090220150824AAQdYXu	News & Events;Current Events	Why should Americans pay for Hamas arab bandits?	President Barack Obama has signed an executive order presidential determination allowing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to resettle in the United States. President Obama's decision, according to the Register, was necessitated by "the urgent refugee and migration needs" of the "victims."    Congratulations, Americans. You have elected the great President! Now you will have to pay the flights, receive, accommodate, employ, cure, teach feed and greet in America hundreds of thousands of people who have been, as Mark Steyn memorably described, "marinated" in a "sick death cult," who voted for Hamas, and 75% of whom support suicide bombings –and all this at the American taxpayers' expense.

I really hate it when he says Frank Sinatra is burning in hell as we speak. I know Frank Sinatra had his issues, but I do not believe he was by any means a bad man and I do think he had some reverence for God. I am a christian myself and I know that you must confess your sins to Christ, but what if Sinatra never understood the concept? What if he was never really told how to be born again since he was raised Catholic?
