Z0I5Qvk7aa	BioShock. Beautiful graphics, awesome use of sound to give depth to the story, amazing storyline...Overall, a great game.

WlTlYMJxaa	LOL      ok.. this is a funny question.. you can kill people from halfway across the map with the sword    energy swords have that function.. when you aim your sword on someone and the little.. aim thingy turns red.. you press X which will cause your player to immediately go to where you are and it kills you    i dont know how to explain it to you so you can understand.. but if you like try practicing with your friends..for example    play on the map gaurdian and go to the center of the map  have one friend stand one side of the platform and then you stand on the other side    then use your sword to aim until the little thingy turns red and press X and watch what happens    its pretty cool actually.. :)     if you practice im sure you'll get it..|`|4VrKKOwnaa	wait til your cross hairs goes red and then you can lunge with the sword|`|PjlhgQ3uaa	hal0 3 sucks get GEARS OF WAR 2 THE MOST EPICIST GAME EVER|`|ghiXastzaa	B swings faster than right trigger.

P93I8CHtaa	its a tight game|`|2g28k1XVaa	Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a sandbox-style action-adventure computer and video game developed by Rockstar North. It is the third 3D game in the Grand Theft Auto video game franchise and fifth original game overall. Originally released for the PlayStation 2 in October 2004, the game has since been ported to the Xbox and Microsoft Windows, and has received wide acclaim and high sales figures on all three platforms. San Andreas was succeeded by Grand Theft Auto IV and was preceded by Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.    The game is set in the fictional state of San Andreas, comprising three metropolitan cities. Set in late 1992, San Andreas revolves around gang member Carl "CJ" Johnson returning home from Liberty City to Los Santos after learning of his mother's murder. CJ finds his family and his old gang, the Grove Street Families, in disarray. Over the course of the game, CJ gradually unravels the plot behind his mother's murder while reestablishing his gang and exploring his own business ventures. Like other games in the series, San Andreas is composed of elements from driving games and third-person shooters, and features "open-world" gameplay that gives the player more control over their playing experience. The game adds several features, such as gang wars, car customization, and character personalization.    Much like the previous entries in the Grand Theft Auto series, San Andreas's critical and commercial success has not been without controversy. The most notable controversy was over the explicit "Hot Coffee" sex minigame found on the Microsoft Windows game, which was disabled but left within the game's code. Its discovery led San Andreas to be re-rated briefly as an adult game and pulled from retailers' shelves.|`|9dvmMRX4aa	What about it|`|OKzGWQRPaa	Information scarce.

DtkLsetkaa	Shrug, I didn't have too hard of a time with it once I got used to the controls.  You know you can hold down the button and just hit Y when you find a good spot to jump to right?  I think the zero G stuff in Dead Space is some of the coolest little extras in any recent games, and the leviathon fight is insane.  Hope you have an easier time with it.|`|XoaFyIY8aa	dat really really SUCKS|`|9y1uYUm3aa	its actually kind of good and easy to do, i enjoy it. makes the game harder epically on impossible|`|Km94hCNnaa	Um i have no trouble jumping in dead space if ur ammo thing blinks red that means u cant jump there and that could explain ur thousand time button mash.|`|T9vf2uU7aa	Dude, as long as you're not aiming at an area you can't physically jump to, then there's no reason you should be having trouble.  The mechanics of the zero-gravity sections of the game were built very well and there isn't much room left for problems aside from user error.  I made it through all of the zero-g parts without incident, so I don't know what to tell ya.  Good luck, though.
fvrFL3yTaa	nope your both gonna need the game...
A7EIsZaAaa	Press Shift-Ctrl-C, the type in:     move_objects on    Go into buy mode and select the baby, and delete it.

You can get the baby taken away by social services but if you have any kids or toddlers in the house they will be taken away also along with the option to adopt any kids.    To get the baby taken away, just keep not feeding it and social service lady will come to take the baby away.|`|F9yuLIHgaa	don't talk to your baby for a long time, then social services will come and take your baby away    /carls jr cares about the health of your baby, your baby will be put under the custudy of carls jr, carls jr, F    you, i'm eating|`|0c94b546c337f60e4e94fbbfaf76006baa	Babies, toddlers and children don't die.

By the way, do not have wild all night parties, the game is designed to teach little lessons.  Now that you have this baby it has limited your game play as a single person.|`|53ebfd092ae98e63df4ada1556252c59aa	Make your sims ignore and neglect it until child services comes and takes it away. That's probably the easiest way to do it.
EkHUl4e7aa	Mario, Link, Snake, and Samus.   But Mario is my all time Favorite. Been using him since the Super smash Bros. came out for N64.|`|Gb5ADIzZaa	OMG ike is so cheap and boring. People pick him all the time and they always win. I dont think Ike users have any skill but win simply bcos Ike can send u flying off the stage in one hit with any damage above 50%.  My favourite is zero suit samus and link and ganondorf.|`|8gXCjxl9aa	My favorite Super smash brothers character is IKE. His move is really strong and its hard to beat him because he can take so much damage still be standing.|`|IZovCDvVaa	Mr. Game and Watch hands down. Best character in the game. A lot of people don't realize how good he is because they don't use him. He has so many attacks and side b can occasionally be a one hit K.O. He also has a great super jump, and his regular b attack is rather comical. (He throws food from a frying pan.) Once you figure out his numerous attacks you should be able to beat anyone. It just takes time.|`|Zqtw1riJaa	Kirby ! my all time favourite =)|`|nN3RTESvaa	My favorite character is Toon Link, Kirby and Pit.Kirbys awsome because he sucks people up [=|`|dDR4RGrbaa	Ike!

Other than him I say Toon Link. =]|`|kES9saVkaa	hmm, got a few, ice climbers, olimar, pokemon trainer, c.falcon, snake, wario, lucas and lucario|`|6D4mO6foaa	My favorite characters are: Kirby, Meta knight and Marth. Kirby is my best because he or she whatever has great moves and you can suck people in and steal one of there powers|`|4NhIt64Uaa	you ppl are all crazy. nobody mentioned the hedgehog. cmon. sonic owns. hes the fastest player (thing...) in the game and runs circles around the bulky characters like ike. sonic just moves out of the way before ike moves, because ike winds up to hit people. plus his final smash will knock everybody on the stage flying and makes his already ridiculous speed even faster.  other than that, lucario and link for me. lucario because he takes massive amounts of damage and gets stronger as his damage increases, and link because, well, its link, straight up beast. :)

AA11224177	Dragon Quest is a series that you either really like, or find to be very repetative.    The games themselves are JRPG, and involve the typical formula of level grinding, exploring, and battle tactics.    Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen is a great game to start with, on the DS. It is the first part of the Zenthanian trilogy and has a nice set of chapters to ease you into game play. This game is pretty long, and has quite a bit to explore. The second part of the trilogy, Dragon Quest V: The Hand of the Heavenly Bride, comes out on February 17th, 2009.    For a quick change of pace from the turn based battles, Dragon Quest Swords on the Nintendo Wii is a first person shooter style game, where you use your controler as the Sword and Shield in the battles. It is a fun game, but somewhat short.    Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King is a great game on the Play Station 2. It also has voice acting, and a very long plot. This game is stand alone, meaning you could start with this game and not be lost because of a back story.    Again, each game's major downfall is that you do spend some time level grinding. The art style, music and battles do make up for it.    I am a big fan of the series, and have really enjoyed the last few games.    I would say start with IV, as it is a fun game, and has a lot to do, and is most likely one of the easier ones to find. Also, if you like it, you already know which one to move to next (being part V).    I am not familure with the other game you mentioned though.

Late one evening one of the cones moves and you can get to him, and he will give it to you. Then you bury the silver one with the other shovel you have. The next day the shovel will be golden!

86f7ab59281183299a346c9bfa75a03eaa	SEASONS! Oh my god, it is soo cool!  University has its pluses too, but seasons is definitely the best.    Seasons gives you, seasons (duh). But it also gives you gardening, fishing, weather, a new neighborhood, new creatures (plant sims anyone?) and new objects like a juicer (to make juices from the plants you grow) and hot cocoa maker. It gives your sims the ability to give gifts, and it gives them a wishing well, as well as FOUR new careers! Plus, you have temperatures--when sims get too cold, they freeze!     If that doesn't appeal, University is right for you! It gives you a new life stage, new interactions, new areas (the universities) and benefits that come with the universities, like if you get a job, you start off three levels above starting level. You get zombies, you can influence people (although that and lifetimes wants are included in seasons), and  lifetime wants--if your sims achieve them, they become permanently platinum.    Nightlife is pretty swell too (wow, I sound like I'm 80). You get cars, a new area (downtown), vampires (although they're kind of hard to play). It gives you the opportunity to go out on dates, as well as on outings--if you go out on a date with a potential suitor, you know their aspiration as well as some wants, so that you can guide your sims away from that sleazy romance sim (or towards, if that floats your boat). Plus, you can ask a sim about what job they have, how much money they have, and what their skills are.    If you only have Pets, these are soo much cooler. Pets are cool and all, but that's about all that came with the expansion pack (also, nice name).     Hope I helped! Happy simming!|`|0c94b546c337f60e4e94fbbfaf76006baa	All of them!!!!  Oh okay if I had to choose I'd get seasons, nightlife, then university in that order.  Of course I pre-ordered them before release. That's what an addiction will do for you.

I know from experience that your code is different from mine. My sister lost her code and had to use my disc to download into her new computer but she is able to play with her disk.

No lo veo como parbola sino como acertijo, y el rey se refiere AL CABALLO, cuando dice "aquel que llegue ltimo ser el primero".  Al cambiar de caballo, el hijo que gana la carrera est llevando ganador al caballo de su hermano, por lo tanto, el hermano que llega ltimo, est montando al caballo del hermano que lleg primero, y es ESE CABALLO el que le da el derecho a SU DUE?O a suceder al Rey.

fB47FZf0aa	You receive talent badges by practicing your task while working. For example, if you are restocking items, then you will gain experience from that, and you will eventually receive a talent badge. There are 4 levels for talent badges, first there are no badges, then it goes to bronze, silver, then gold.    Skill jobs are basically the same, except you get the the job points at home. When are you buying an item, it should say any job skills that it improves, for example, buying a stove and any other cooking items will give you experience in cooking. Or playing chess helps you with logic.    By the way, your job skills will also affect how well your character is while working.|`|0c94b546c337f60e4e94fbbfaf76006baa	Skill building: by studying or performing tasks related to a specific skill.

kydypu5Raa	a real easy way is to use the boolprop cheat. All you have to do is when you're in the neighborhood, hit (control, shift, and c) at the same time to pull up a text box. In the text box type in the following without the brackets   [boolprop testingcheatsenabled true] make sure you have the two spaces or it will not work. Then when you go into your house you can click and drag the relationship bars as high as you want them. Make sure you up the relationships of both sims you want to fall in love. Then all you have to do is have them interact once and they will fall in love. You can also up the sims motives using this cheat too, just click and drag.|`|3f913a3e987d2de8b2cc38dfc7b9da14aa	if you are on about the pc game yes. get enough aspiration (the things your sim wants to do and they get points for it) then buy the love tub its called or something like that. you will know it when you see it. get your sim and the sim you want them to fall in love with to get in it at the same time and then they should start getting alot of relationship point things when they speak or whatever.|`|0c94b546c337f60e4e94fbbfaf76006baa	cheat code    boolProp TestingCheatsEnabled true    shift & click on the sim, select spawn, select Tombstone of L&D    click the tombstone and choose Make me friendly with everyone here    this cheat makes your person's relationship 90/90 with everyone on the lot that they have interacted with    to make them fall in love flirt

iSNtznE3aa	Okay, well, I have Guitar Hero I, II, and III.    I like the third one best, but I played it first....the first two just aren't as good! I don't like the songs as much, "hard" isn't all that hard, and the buttons are harder to hit for some reason (yeah, that should depend on the controller, but trust me I'm using the same one...) I haven't tried Aerosmith yet, but then again I don't like all of Aerosmith's music so I might think it sucks. I'm waiting for Guitar Hero: World Tour, to be honest. It's supposed to be pretty good.    Rock Band 1 is cool too. I don't own it, but one of my friends does. I'm the drummer, because the guitar that comes with it is terrible compared to the Guitar Hero guitars. Much harder to use. They have some weird songs, but also some pretty cool ones.    I don't think Rock Band copied Guitar Hero, because there are more instruments...if they did, they made it better. However, the new Guitar Hero has drums...so it sounds like they're copying Rock Band!    Between me and my friends, we'll probably have them all soon. I could probably give a better opinion then lol.|`|uRReUowHaa	Guitar Hero is better. I liked GH3. It took me two days to beat it. Instead of the first two Guitar Heros only took one day.

And Harmonix made both GH1,2 and Rock of the 80's then went on to make Rockband, so not really a copy...just the same company making  a different product|`|UHUGmVngaa	Rock Band's creators MADE Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero 2. They didn't copy anything, they made the genre what it is today. It's also better than GH.    GH4 is looking to be a carbon copy of Rock Band.

QdD3xcPCaa	I began with the thompson with the perks, bazooka, juggernaut, deep impact, and water cooler. I kept with that until about lvl 10. Then i got rid of juggernaut because I was getting better and replaced it with stopping power. Around 20 or so I began using the MP40 and the DP-28. At 21 I used my mosin-nagant to do a little sniping. Idk what to do afterwards. You get better guns around the 30ish lvls, but i am assuming you only want to know how to start off. I always kept my special grenade as tabun gas. And my pistol was always the walther. Hope I could help. Btw, this may not work for everybody, but it worked for me.

6164e6a0d47ec4e9fba4d5f480c28c0daa	The Bedazzler is a bit fiddly to use at first until you get the hang of it. I was all fingers and thumbs with mine until I put in a bit of practice! It's not the machine itself that's tricky, it's keeping hold of the studs/rhinestones and not dropping them all over the place that's the problem!    The main thing with it is to make sure that the setting plate is PERFECTLY aligned with the plunger otherwise it won't set things properly. You need to try it out on some old fabric first until you get the hang of it and how much pressure to apply etc. I've also used my Bedazzler in card making to great effect.    I would recommend hand washing items that have studs on - either that or you could put the item in a pillowcase and set the washing machine on a delicate wash. At least then if some do fall out they are caught in the pillowcase and are not clogging up your machine!|`|21d4a230bd482f86dfbb2baf730bd62aaa	My wife just bought the GeMagic and she found it very easy and fun to use.

AA11220927	that is a great idea, if you can re create some of the jewelry items that is seen in video games, guys, girls or anyone who are crazy about a particular game will go and buy it.    look into current and popular games and find out about the item that the character wear. Games such as World Of Warcraft, Final Fantasy, or even the older Resident Evil 4 has items that look liked rings, bracelets, necklace or headpiece that resembles jewelries. If you did you research very well,  and replicate the item and the name well, you would be a crowd seller.      So what i would buy is either rings, bracelets, or braces.

Dso7k3sjaa	I have these games installed:    The Sims 2  University  Nightlife  Open for Business  Seasons  Family Fun stuff  Glamour Life stuff  Celebrations stuff    The games put files into two different locations on your computer.  The part that keeps your saves and all your cc is in the My Documents section.  I have over 3,000 pieces of cc in that part.  When I look at the folder there it is:    The Sims 2 folder 1.00 GB   but when I pull all of my custom content out, it is only 766 MB.    Files that store the info to run the game are found in Program files.  There is an EA Games folder there and it says 7.47 GB.    Does that help?    Oh, but I did want to tell you that "storage" space and RAM are NOT the same thing at all.  I actually only have 1 GB of ram and my game plays well and never crashes or locks up.  But my computer is still an XP.  If you have Vista, it is recommended that you have at least 2 GB of ram because Vista uses a lot more ram than XP does.    This question sounds like you are actually worried about how much "physical" space the game will take up on your computer.  That's what I actually listed.  If you are really wondering if 3 GB of ram will play the game, that's plenty.  But your game may still not play well if it's on a laptop, no matter if there enough space and ram or not.  Most laptops have an integrated video card and the majority of these types of cards have problems with the sims 2 games.    Actually, EA made The Sims Life Stories, The Sims Pet Stories and The Sims Castaways so that people who want to play a sims game but have a laptop that won't quite work right with The Sims 2 games would still be able to play a "sims" type of game.

Critically, CoD4 was better, but CoD5 is more recent, so, in theory its lower critical score is weighted higher. This is only important if you are the kind of person who screams at the T.V. "I PUSHED THE BUTTON, I PUSHED THE BUTTON!" at the slightest delay. Overall, they are unique experiences, I have not yet had the opportunity to play either, however, had I played them, I think I would prefer CoD5, they just don't have flamethrowers in modern-warfare. I also feel this way because CoD5 has a different feel, and is the most up-to-date WWI FPS I know of, so it has a sort of retro appeal as the newer games are about current, and future events. My Gamertag is Filsphan, I do not have any of the CoD games, so adding me, without having a copy of BF:BC, or Halo3 is pointless.|`|M0Fs1GAkaa	Like said before, its up to you. If you like modern combat, I'd suggest call of duty 4. If you like the old WWII Style of war, I'd pick call of duty 5.

ZZR9OTzVaa	Make sure you scan those files for viruses, as most viruses can easily be spread through pirated software.  If you want your machine to turn into a zombie for email spam, or steal your passwords and credit card numbers, then I would proceed with caution.    Otherwise do what Barrak T said to do to get the game going.|`|AA12071655	That's part of the adventure, learning how to make this pirated software work. You might actually learn something in the process.|`|oKvECE2uaa	This is what you need to do:    Go to the CUE file and right click it.

SEwqwjPkaa	I'm fairly active in the gaming community from xboxlive to xbox.com forums to gt.com, etc. and this is the first I've heard anything about an "across the board" price drop on top end retail prices.  Where did you get this info?  Since Microsoft doesn't set the MSRP for games published by another company, I see no way they could regulate such prices.  That said, I would imagine the developers and publishers will continue to set their own price drops.    I also work in software development and if anything the trend we're seeing is a RISE in pricing across the board.  Keep in mind, Software is GLOBAL so why would anyone drop prices to ONLY benefit the USA?    Hmmmmm...    Good question though.    Peace!  The Reverend    P.S.  I have a buddy who works for Infinity Ward.  I'll check with him and see what their latest price points are.|`|0LQ5CuL0aa	i guess we will just have to wait and see.|`|h5W91onUaa	Doubt it.|`|gu0AxKyiaa	aint heard anything about them changing the prices of any new games|`|3997f747046299c595d0afecef21fdb0aa	It really depends on the game and the company publishing the game.  Games that are coming out shortly such as Street Fighter IV and Resident Evil 5 are for sure going to be at $59.99, with the collector's editions of those games going for a lot more.  That's because they know people will pay that price.    There are games that release at cheaper prices, such as Banjo-Kazooie Nuts 'N Bolts, which released at $39.99, and you can always look for used games in stores and online.  There are some very good deals out there if you just look around.|`|7149cc77e896d5ec422f3b24ea6b300faa	pray to god and see wat happens =]|`|nmBbRtnvaa	not if you get them on ebay just got world at war brand new 29.00 great game|`|2Wysnyquaa	they dont give a WHAT WHAT,they will just charge the same if not more

I bought a new system 1.5 years ago and had to have it refurbished because of the RROD (which got fixed for free by microsoft) so refurbished are pretty reliable when you buy from stores like these.    If you really wanted cheap and are willing to risk reliability you could always try craigslist!|`|entEQwG7aa	Try:  http://www.cex.co.uk/    You can also trade your old games in, also many shops darted around so check if theres a store near you!

CKRfaRYvaa	I would start with the Trilogy because if you have all three games, then you can move from one game to the other with the same character.  You also get more character slots.  Eye of the North can only be played by level 20 characters, so you wouldn't be able to play it when you first got it, anyway, and you can always pick it up later.|`|SilePenzaa	Just get Guild Wars Trilogy.

sarUn38haa	This will happen for almost every PC game.  Even if the graphics are as good or maybe even better, it still wont run as sharply on a PC.  Your best option is to get a games console because at least you know the games will work and work well.|`|Ob9AZnA4aa	no definitely not. the ps3 has the ability to play in 1080p (progressive) meaning there are more lines of resolution. PS3 looks nice on a standard tv, but on the newer LCD tv's it looks bomb on 720 or 1080. This years madden only plays in 720 or 1080i, but it should improve next year as most games are being moved to that format ability. 1080 tv's provide a little over 2 mil pixels of resolution to just under 1 mil for 720 and that's the main difference. The difference between 1080i (interlaced) and 1080p is that 1080i resolute the odd number vertical resolution lines whereas 1080p does all.    The worst rated team will be without a doubt the Detroit Lions unless they get very lucky in the free agency and the draft. Nothing against them, but they did go defeated haha.

I'm going to have to check out TSR again.  I've been there many times and I've never seen cc offered in Sims2Pack files, only in zipped folders yet people on this site keep saying that TSR offers it in that format.    Just out of curiosity, what type of stuff can you download from TSR that comes in a Sims2Pack file?  Oh, and that's what they call the installer that EA invented  for the sims 2.  I have never actually seen any site that offers things in that format, only EA's Exchange, but they must at TSR because you are probably the 10th person at least that has mentioned that TSR has it.    But like I said, I've gotten things from TSR and they were in zipped folders, not the same folders as EA, weird.    I can give you a link to a good tutorial that explains how to get cc from other sites though:    http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...    **eta -- thumbs-up to the person below me -- but MTS doesn't have anything in the same type of installer packages as EA offers.  Well, sims and lots are first put into that type of installer and then they are compressed further and put either into a zip or a rar folder.  If you download either a sim or a lot off of MTS, after you extract the files out of the zip or rar, then you will see the installer that EA offers, but not until after it comes out of the zip or rar folder first.|`|kyUXpRFeaa	Here are some of my favorite, free and safe downloading websites:    http://www.modthesims2.com/  http://www.xmsims.com/  http://www.pimp-my-sims.com/    Have fun!|`|F52Slt8Laa	http://www.modthesims2.com/  http://www.xmsims.com/  http://www.pimp-my-sims.com/  http://paysitesmustbedestroyed.org/ (GO HERE)  http://raonsims.com/

PS3 has the blu ray and 360 doesnt    Online play is better on the 360 versus PS3.    360 has great price deals whereas PS3 is still fairly expensive to purchase.    But hey get one for yourself and try it out.|`|ZaECpTwQaa	I would have to say you could pick one  PS3                                       360     ____                                      _____  Blue Ray                               nothing  95 percent of graphics             87 percent of graphics  More Games Come OUT        Some Same Games come out 4 both  Wireless Radar for Online          No online|`|a0jcA9zqaa	It matters how far you break your analysis down, if you look at the basics, 360 has sold more then the PS3, if you take it down to the core of the systems, 360 sells their stuff seprate, instead of throwing in the wireless adapter, the free internet, the other things, they give you the choice of using them, driving the cost of the core system down, while the PS3 threw it all in, and the price is $500-$600, then if you go deeper and look at preformance, the PS3 does have a better graphics card, a better hard drive and everything that makes it superior to the 360, but Microsoft has marketability, they are able to bring in exclusives like Halo, Gears of War, Fable, and all the others to make it the more wantable of the game systems, while the PS3 attracts the same gamers it has since the late 90's with games like Final Fantasy and Metal Gear Solid, it just matters are you old school(PS3) or Nu School(360)???|`|zooXjOv4aa	at this point, the ps3 is a much better system and here is the reasons why.    Cost: The PS3 is much cheaper in the long run. When you purchase a $400 ps3 you are getting everything you need. You get built in rechargeable bateries, built in WiFi adapter, free online service and a bluray player. other accesories are cheaper too. I got an really good bluetooth headset for $50 and it works for my cell phone too. I also bought a External hard drive that works for my PS3 and my PC or laptop and it has a 1000 GB on it for $150.    When you buy a $300 360 Pro it does not come with rechargable batteries or built in WiFi. Rechadgeable battery packs are $20 per controller and a WiFi adapter is $100. You also have to pay $50 a year for xbox live. You dont get a bluray player. Wireless headsets are $60 (and it wont work with your cell) and microsofts harddrives cost $150 for 120 GB.  As you can see the ps3 is a much better value.    You can also say the PS3 has way more exclusives than the 360. The PS3 has games like Metal Gear 4, Little Big Planet, Uncharted, Resistance 1, Valkiria Chronicles, Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Resistance 2, Folklore, and this year (2009) it will get Killzone 2, God of war 3, Uncharted 2, Infamous, Heavy Rain, and White Knight Chronicles.    The 360 has Halo 3, Fable 2, Gears of War 2, and Ninja Gaiden 2. Almost all it's other "big" titles have gone to the PS3 (like Bioshock and Eternal Sonata) or you can play on your computer (like gears of war and Mass Effect). Later this year the 360 is going to get Halo Wars, Ninja Blade (a ninja gaiden rip off) and a expansion pack for halo 3 called Halo 3 ODST (or Halo 3 Recon). I also predict that by the end of the year Fable 2 and Gears of War 2 will be available on computer too.    It is true that the 360 has more games than the PS3 but most of those games are really bad games that only get put on 360 and PS2. Both systems have great games like call of duty and rock band but the PS3 has way more exclusives.    I could talk about how much the 360's break or how strong the PS3 processor is or how awesome bluray looks, or how much game data gets stored on a PS3 disc Vs. a 360 disc but i don't really need to. If i haven't already conviced you that the PS3 is better, then you must have master chief jammed so far up your *** that you can't think clearly.|`|6PO2CiRVaa	Well none of the to are better it depends on you  ps3-blue ray  xbox 360-xbox live  well they both have the goods and the badds|`|tJhWpNELaa	Definitely PS3 !!|`|CMwAzfKbaa	Well the Box cost only $400 for it's top console. But the base PS is $500. On IGN, they posted an email sent to them from Microsoft before E3 05 in a PS3 VS X360, unedited, saying that Sony missed the plot on the processor. They designed it with linear programming, not graphics like the XBOX. Plus it is running at 3.2 ghz A CORE! It has 3 cores meaning 9.6 ghz. They said alot me other things but you com check it out yourself. Just go to google and type in xbox360 vs PS3 and look for the one at IGN. ADD ON: stefan jones, you make a useless point. You can play Xbox games on the Xbox360 to?

YSmYkc5Yaa	You just have to practice. Those higher levels have been playing for a lot longer and know how to do it.     Learn how to use all of the weapons and what it takes to kill somebody with those weapons.    The Battle Rifle- Can be close range or long range weapon. Should take 4 shots to kill someone with the BR. Aim for the head though, or even the shoulder area. But definitely practice for the head. That's what I do and nobody can out BR me usually.    The Assault Rifle (or the smg works about the same)- Close range weapon. You'll learn the technique with this, it's usually only a few shots and a melee will bring down the opponent quickly.     Shotgun- Close range weapon, either a really close one shot, or a shot and a beat down will take them down right away. Same with sword, mauler or hammer, they're very close range weapons and are a one time deal.    Sniper-(My personal favorite)- Obviously, one shot head shots will kill them instantly, or two body shots. That's obviously a long range weapon.    There are more weapons but learn the techniques with the basic ones and just practice practice practice.|`|tL9SuAWbaa	Just practice Halo 3 online takes some getting used to...people who have played for a while can judge the distance and know the weapons better (as far as online play goes).

(thanks, i forgot that part lol)|`|CE5CfQABaa	to add to what Arial39 said, I would use some canned air on the power source, video card, and processor fan. Take it outside and spray the tower out.|`|DSOJvIhtaa	Agreed. Make sure the tower itself is clean. Piece it back together and try it again. If it still does it, take off the side panel and use a big 'room' fan pointed in the case. If it stays running then you are having a heating problem (the big fan pumps more heat away then the puny case fans, I had my system setup with one when i was having heating issues) If it still shuts down you have some hardware issues.|`|RwzlaG8baa	I would check your memory with MemTest86.

(in this way at least)|`|VBfhoqS3aa	You cant delete all of them off the internet. There is always going to be at least 1 emulator hiding somewhere, and everyone else will get it and put it back on their website. Just a guess though.|`|njO5Xajfaa	No one trys to stop it ,so it just grows and grow more of them|`|YoiuismKaa	I think your talking about games you gotta pay for and you can just download them yes its illegal but I do it and everyone does nothing happened only one thing happen to me it said when I made a 5 second game illegal and then tommorow it was gone so you can do it but its illegal     you cant really stop the internet from doing that they just put it the people who put it ether dont get caught or they deal with the consques

c9a288a9179a49e1e11ea327ae8a320daa	No, there are no other shops that open, but the thing about ressetti is true. When you go to the city after 8, like 8:05 or something, go all the way to the right where the cones are. One day after you've been checking for a while, the cones will be moved  and a yellow light will come from ressetti's shop. It took about 2 weeks for me after I started looking and finally it opened, but it only opens that time because there's no sense to it besides him giving u a free silver shovel that doesnt do anything. you cant do anything else in his shop and he yells at u.  So keep checking back each night and eventually the cones will move. ...you have to be patient    also, dont go to the stupid theater in the city untill u payed off ur mortgage. it is a huge waste. I went there thinking it was something good and I got to see that stupid ugly clown do ugly things and all i got was a sad emotion button to use ...so stupid  ______________________________________...  to respond to what simlover below me said about resetting the game... that does not work. I tried it numerous times and when I turn it back on and come out of my house, resetti just pops up out of the dirt and yells at me. It does not make the shop magically open|`|glynFK9haa	Resetti has his headquarters in the city.    "If you're very lucky, you can sometimes visit the Resetti Surveillance Center, workplace of Sonny Resetti (whom you may have met if you've been naughty and reset the game a few times).  Dash to the right after stepping off the bus to find a pair of orange construction cones in front of a small tunnel.  You usually can't enter this tunnel because of the cones, but check here every evening after 8 PM and you might notice that the cones are pushed aside, letting you enter the tunnel beyond!    "There isn't much to see inside the Resetti Surveillance Center except Sonny himself.  Speak to him to freak him out that you snuck into his 'off-limits' workplace.  He begs you to leave and even hands you a silver shovel in the hopes that you'll keep the whole even under wraps.  No problem, Sonny!"    Also, you can't get any shops other than GracieGrace, Shampoodle, The Auction House, The Marquee, Redd's, The HRA, and Katrina's Fortunes.

lIYKAvvRaa	Alright, so what you do is you take an empty residential lot and build your apartment, using the apartment doors on each apartment. You then bring up the cheat box by pressing Ctrl-Shift-C all at the same time, and type in "changelotzoning apartmentbase". Then you save the lot and leave. It should be an apartment now. You can do the same things with everything, by typing in "changelotzoning hotel, community, residential, dorm, etc"|`|AA11859735	Ok you need to build your apartment like a regular residential lot then rezone it      more info on the finer details can be found here    http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...

4sZSiU3Kaa	Well, it's more gruesome in terms of violence, as killing an enemy often results in them being dismembered and losing body parts. However, there is no sexual content, only occasional suggestive (non-sexual) conversations. Also, people will ask you to kill other people just so their business will do better and for other similar reasons, although that probably is in GTA and Saint's Row as well. Also, although there is drug use in Fallout, you never see yourself or anyone else actually using them.|`|786QN5Aeaa	I would say a little more gruesome than the both, you have to make some disturbing choices during the game sometimes

d889ec36bb9adc89f3addb3dde100e23aa	Left 4 Dead    Cons: Public rooms can be horrible  Pros: it's really fun, and the random enemy placement does make it interesting    HL2 Mods:     Pros: you get them free if you own HL2  Con: there are bugs, and either a server is full or completly empty    RE5:  Pros: it looks good, and the previous games were great  cons: it's not out yet|`|MTPa5Bxwaa	Left 4 Dead is great, especially if you have friends to do the campaigns with.  Dead Space is one of the best horror, scary games i've played.  Dead Rising is old and okay but can be frustrating.  RE5 looks like it should be a hell of a game but we'll have to wait until March to see.|`|iUudFiIbaa	I would recommand Left 4 Dead it is pretty cool hordes and hordes of zombies keep opopping up and you can plant claymores!     But if you want a scary haunted game, get resident evil 5|`|dnJrOj96aa	definitly left4dead!!!!!!!the online multiplayer is fun as hell the single player mode is fun too|`|w9nNtuttaa	if i were u i would get the left 4 dead game for 360 and the dead rising game they not related but gives u best of both worlds.|`|1MeMsVYeaa	Call of duty World at War Zombie Mode.    Check gameplay on youtube. fairly good.    However in order of what u have said i would pick the following:    Left 4 Dead  Resident Evil 5  Half life 2 Mod (Zombie Mod)|`|SxsJEAOiaa	Left 4 Dead|`|786QN5Aeaa	im a big fan of zombie games, ive heard left 4 dead is awesome if u have friends to play with. The best one is 'Dead Rising' came out when xbox360 came out. Hands down best zombie game there is, set in a mall like Dawn of the Dead. millions of zombies|`|JR3Ol1VGaa	Left4Dead is awesome.    The single player is fun.    The co-op is really fun, especially with friends. It is quite a challenge even for good players on the harder difficulty levels.    Full Versus is MAYHEM! One team are the special zombies (who each have particular characteristics and attacks) and they try to stop the survivors. The zombies respawn every 30 seconds or so (along with the constant whordes of AI controlled zombies) and, if the work together can be very formidable and rather scary.    Left4Dead is one of the best and most original shooters I have played for years.|`|BLwtzGWcaa	Left 4 Dead is fun.  HL2 I found kinda boring, but many disagree...  Resident Evil series has never failed before. I played the demo on LIVE and it was amazing gameplay and it gives you the feeling of danger...but still comical relief if you know how to mess with scenery and commands...    Obviously I would pick Resident Evil 5.  They are always great games.
J3kfQtViaa	I used to play as zerg often.  My favorite strategy was massing hydralisks.  I did that probably more than anything else.  You always need to build a 2nd hatchery to produce more guys.  Zerg are expensive too so you need to expand.  I never really liked zerg air, too much gas required.  if you play on hunters, send the 5th or 6th drone immediately to the expansion and build a hatchery, then build sunkens, lol.  Never underestimate sending in 150 zerglings into someones base late game.|`|6wSmZrrsaa	People usually make a grid line of hatchery and weave many sunken's around it.  You call forth huge waves of any kind of zerg. I like to go with guardians and hydrolisk

If you put your Charizard in the daycare on 4 island then you'll get a Charmander egg IF, you wait a little while (About 4 minutes) then go back to the day care. The old man should look like he took a step foreward. Talk to him and he'll give you the egg (Only if you have 5 Pokemon in your Party). To your second question: You can't get the other starters in the game without using a Action Replay or Game Shark (Don't use Game Shark), or trading with a friend. Sorry
SEwqwjPkaa	Unfortunately, when you save a game or allow the console to save on your behalf, you'll always go back to the last checkpoint.  There's never going to be any spawning exactly where you left off.  Allowing the player to save at any given point would be way to complicated from a developers point of view...I know as I am one.    And YES, it is possible to play with two players online at the same time on the same console in some modes of play.  And no, an additional paid account is not required.  That person would simply be your guest.  You'll want to read up on the MP and Co-op modes though as some will not allow this type of play.  I know you can do this on the Zombie mission but not sure about TDM or alike.    Hope this helps!    Peace!

AA11220927	The Sim Super Star is an expansion pack where you will get nes skin, new  objects like a massage table with a maussuer that you have to call, new careerswhich are model, singer and actor/actress, you will also get a butler, a stalker to come to your house, and a new place, kinda like hollywood where you can hang out with the stars like Avril and Christina and is also the place where you work as the model, singer, actor/actress.    Makin Magic is the last expansion pack, where you can live the world like Harry Potter, you have new objects, skins and a new place kinda like haloween town/magic town. the new place has 3 new magic lots that you have to buy with magic coins and simoleons, that has special effects  when you perform magic. Yes magic, because you can buy a magic wand, a spellbook, and a magic pot to make spells such as invisibilty, love spell or even to become rich. you can even make your fridge come to life or turn your pets into a human being. you can even transform your childrens into adults.

Plug it in, let the PC find it, configure the controls to your satisfaction and get moving.

d6f874536d7241bf153f1945b2c98ca3aa	There is a game controller (N64) adapter called the Adaptoid that can be configured with any videogame, because it can map the keyboard and mouse controls right on the controller itself (pc thinks your controller is the mouse or keyboard).  The only drawback is, perhaps, that you may not like N64 controllers.|`|b1cadb0a532d14b8d0c5de644fc08318aa	assuming you have the drivers set up then you should be able to go into the control configuration and map each button to an action    that said, you can expect to get thoroughly pwned by everybody with a keyboard and mouse
AA10803194	TV's that large, are not standard definintion(meaning they only are 480i) Thats already a Hi Def TV. The wii only supports 480p. The Wii will look better if you play it on a regular 20 inch TV. Thats my opinion. You see the difference is 480i means interlaced meaning the lines on ur TV are being drawn with colors and what not, half and half(240 lines then the other 240 lines) 480p means all 480 lines are being drawn all at once, providing sharper and better images.

The addicting part may be due to the flashing lights and floating blocks.... but anyways.... lol    The game pretty much incorporates addictive gameplay with great music. And the game is great multiplayer offline and online.    You can also create remixes of the songs in the game, and put your own touch on them.    Online mode also allows you to upload your remixes to review to be put up, and you can download some remixes    Last time I checked Online was still up and running, with a handful of people online.

It's graphically intense, but some of the game logistics are bullshit.  You'll be shooting a better and faster firing gun than the other person... be shooting multiple times at their head at close range and they'll hit you once with a shitty gun and kill you automatically.  It's worth trying and the multiplayer is fun despite some of the difficulties.  The campaign isn't half bad either.

Each book should have a "home project" section that will include curtain patterns.    I must say, however, that making your own curtains isn't really worth the effort. Unless you are trying to make something extremely complicated and unusual, the cost of the fabric alone will be more than the cost of premade curtains in a place like Target. I'm not even factoring in the amount of time it will take, even for someone who is very expereienced with sewing.|`|6434173572be15e4d7e0e493bd557fb5aa	all you really need to do is heam the seams, so measure your windows and add 6 inches to it. that's how much fabric you will need. its really easy|`|d7960a4abc9965d6993491c1896e06ccaa	sew
