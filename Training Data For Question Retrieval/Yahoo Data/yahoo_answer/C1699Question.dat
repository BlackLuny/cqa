Would this not also expand the black market on tobacco which will eventually increase crime and cost tax payers more money in the judicial system let along saturate our law enforcement resources?

Three  men - an Australian farmer, Osama bin Laden and a      Biker are  all walking together one day.     They  come across a lantern and a Genie pops out of  it.     'I  will give each  of you  one wish, which is three wishes in total',      says  the Genie.     The  Australian says, 'I am a farmer and my son will  also farm.  I want the land to be forever  fertile in Australia  '     POOF!   With the blink of the Genie's eye, the land in   Australia was forever fertile for farming.     Osama  was amazed, so he said, 'I want a wall around   Afghanistan ,   Palestine ,   Iraq and   Iran  so that no infidels, Americans or Australians     can  come into our precious land.'     POOF!   Again, with the blink of the Genie's eye, there  was a huge wall around those countries.     The Biker says,  'I am very curious.     Please  tell me more about this wall.'     The  Genie explains, 'Well, it's about 5,000 feet  high, 5oo feet thick and completely surrounds  the country.  Nothing can get in or  out;       it's  virtually impenetrable.'     The Biker  sits down on his Harley, cracks a beer, lites a  cigar,     smiles  and says,       'Fill  it with water.'     I  pretty much vote this my favorite email of  the  year....                   **************************************...

The BBC has defended its decision to drop Carol Thatcher from The One Show over an off-air remark, saying she was given "ample opportunity to apologise".       She was axed as a reporter on the show after she referred to a tennis player as a "golliwog" while backstage.       This is typical of public sector managers who have not the bottle to deal with problems in house and have to make it public. If the head of the programme had taken her into his/her office explained it had upset some people and she must not do this again and if she does he/she then will have no other choice but to put her on a discipline to be dealt with by whoever does this at the BBC. In the UK public sector workers dare not have a joke or a private conversation just in case someone passing hears and reports them. Political correctness gone nuts.

This is a very exciting new program that I will explain using the Q and A format:                   Q. What is an Economic Stimulus Payment?            A. It is money that the federal government will send to taxpayers.                   Q. Where will the government get this money?            A. From taxpayers.                   Q. So the government is giving me back my own money?            A. Only a smidgen.                   Q. What is the purpose of this payment?            A. The plan is that you will use the money to purchase a high-definition TV set, thus stimulating the economy.                   Q. But isn't that stimulating the economy of China?            A. Shut up.          Below is some helpful advice on how to best help the US economy by spending your stimulus check wisely:                   If you spend that money at Wal-Mart, all the money will go to China.                  If you spend it on gasoline it will go to the Arabs.            If you purchase a computer it will go to India.                 If you purchase fruit and vegetables it will go to Mexico,            Honduras, and Guatemala (unless you buy organic).            If you buy a car it will go to Japan.            If you purchase useless crap it will go to Taiwan.                   And none of it will help the American economy.                   We need to keep that money here in America. You can keep the money            in America by spending it at yard sales, going to a baseball game,            or spend it on prostitutes, beer and wine (domestic ONLY), or            tattoos, since those are the only businesses still in the US.
