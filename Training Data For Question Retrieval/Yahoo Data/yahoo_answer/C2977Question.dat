Examples (not at all comprehensive):      "Global warming alarmists belive temperature will rise 6C over the 21st century, as there has been no warming?"      "More info saying that Global Warming is a hoax?"      "Why do the GW enthusiast deny over 35,000 sientists who say GW is garbage?"      -----      What is their motive?  Do they have any genuine interest in the subject or are they here mainly here to get attention and spread propaganda from their cult?

20090226162645AALJhi4	Environment;Alternative Fuel Vehicles	How do Carbon Credits work if I switch my fleet to Diesel?	If I were to be running an Pilot training and aircraft rental service that runs on an AV GAS fleet, and switched to more fuel efficient and cleaner Diesel engined aircraft would I be eligible for Carbon Credits?       Modern diesel engined trainer aircraft burn at half the rate of AV GAS and are clean.      Also, would I get any Tax breaks since I would be more efficient and greener?      I'm based in Canada..

20090226173644AACO4Gx	Environment;Green Living	Blackle - Saving Energy One Small Step at a Time?	Blackle.com is a search engine, powered by google, and just like google, except it only does website searches rather than pictures, maps, etc.       The thing about Blackle.com is it saves energy and helps our environment because it takes more energy to show a white/light screen than a black/dark screen. So basically, if you use blackle instead of google you help save energy. Hey, it may not be a big difference, but if you spread the word and more people know, the small step can grow into a bigger help to save energy and help our planet.      Blackle:  http://www.blackle.com/    About Blackle and How it Saves Energy:  http://www.blackle.com/about/       I just wanted to get the word out about the site to more people, so the best answer will come from, what do you think, and are you going to switch to using blackle to help?

20090226173419AAY1jc3	Environment;Green Living	Are there two different groups of environmentalists?	From what I've seen, there's two groups of environmentalists:      1) Those who want to improve our technology, create new and cheaper energy sources, and generally improve our lifestyle.      2) Those who see humanity as a fungus on the planet, want to revert our progress and restrict our liberties, and whine and moan about anything that makes life enjoyable (I call them the atheist Puritans)      Is this really the case? Are there names for the two groups?
