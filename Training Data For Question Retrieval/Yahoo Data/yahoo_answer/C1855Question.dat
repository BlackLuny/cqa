To affirm your willingness and cooperation please do so by replying to this mail with your private contact details. A mobile phone number will do to initiate intense communication between us.   I will provide mine upon request to build trust between us.  I do expect your response as soon as possible.   Thank you,   Mr xxxxxxxxxx   Audit Department

20090225034854AAlipWC	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	How do I activate and use the Dell Inspiron 1525 integrated webcam?	I realize that I am lame, but nevertheless, I cannot figure out or find out how to enable and use my integrated 2.0 megapixel webcam on my Dell Inspiron 1525. I bought the computer used and have no booklets. Help and Support on the Start Button has only one entry when I search webcam (frankly, I'm not sure if that's help for the computer or Vista). Google has been fruitless after about 45 minutes of various searches. I couldn't find a messageboard discussing this, something I've been able to do for other problems in the past. I've pressed the Dell Media Direct button hoping to find a lead. I've looked on the control panel with no luck. Really, I know next to nothing about computers, but I have made a good faith effort to get this answer without luck. Bottom line is I need basic directions. How can I use my webcam on the internet both with people with webcams and those like parents without? What do I click or push to make it work, or do I need to download some driver or find some set-up wizard other item first (these are new terms for me just discovered in this fruitless search). Please assume you're communicating with a complete idiot basket case who knows relatively little jargon.

20090224173605AA9a3iw	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Is there a way to speed up my internet?	Just wondering because the speed I pay for is 3Mbit/s, which is the highest offered in my area, which is about 375kB/s.  Anyway, when I'm downloading something, if I limit it to say 200kB/s and then wait a little while, and then set it to unlimited, it will jump up to 600kB/s, however it won't stay.  Will stay there for about two or three seconds, then slowly go down to 500kB/s, then 400kB/s, then 350kB/s and stop there.  Anyway, just wondering, since it can hit 600kB/s, is there a way to make it stay there?       Thanks for the help!

Graphics Card: ATI Radeon Xpress 800 Series   RAM: 2GB      I was playing World of Warcraft and noticed that several texture were messed up, like flashing water, red/blue grass and walls, and other multicolored surfaces. It gradually got worse over time, and now I cant go many places without there being textures messing up.      I thought that maybe my graphics card was in need of a replacement (it is kind of old but WoW has worked on it for a while now) but then I got to wondering if it was just overheating. If it is overheating, should I get a new card too since this one may be messed up from the overheating? How can I tell what I need to do?      Also, I have read things implying that a new graphics card can fix lag? Is that true or would it make things slower if I got a better graphics card?

20090224234903AA1U8oW	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Programming problem...?	1. wordCount1 uses text parsing or tokenization to analyze text into counts of each distinct word unit. This has many practical applications in spell checking, document difficulty analysis, cryptology and file compression.   Set up a getData() method that reads data from an array of strings. This method will be replaced once file i/o has been covered. Use the string tokenizer example. Rework it to call getData() for the text. Add a second parameter to the tokenizer that explicitly specifies all required delimiters (include punctuation but not apostrophe or hyphen). Lowercase (desense) all parsed words. Add a linear search for the word in a word array prior to adding it. If found, increment its count in a parallel count array else add it to the list with a count of 1.   The output should display the word array and its associated word count. Use a fixed field format that allows sorting of the report by another utility. A suggestion is ### wordstring. You may want to review the DecimalFormat Class for formatting specifics.   2. wordCount2.java adds basic file IO to our previous project in word counting. Reuse wordCount1 and add the text io class to the workspace class.      below is my coding...   can u help me 2 check 2 error?      import java.util.*; import java.text.*; import java.io.*;   public class wordCount2  // a very simple driver class   {     static final String USAGE="Usage: java wordCount2 files(s)";     static String fi,fo;     public static void main(String args[])     {       WC_Model model = new WC_Model();       if (args.length != 2) {System.out.println(USAGE); return;}       if (args.length>0) {fi=args[0];fo=args[1];}       model.runFile(fi,fo); model.showRanMsg();     }   }   class WC_Model   {     static boolean isRpt=false;     static int t,tok,top,tokenCount;     static String inFileName,intext,outFileName;     static int wc[]=new int[500],wordCounts[]=new int[500];     static String w[]=new String[500],words[]=new String [500];     // class constructor and initializer     public WC_Model() {top=0;tokenCount=0;}     // observer methods for external display of results     public String getData()     {       String data=new String(""), buf=new String();       TextIO io=new TextIO();       File fi = new File(inFileName); io.openText(fi,"read");       while ((buf=io.readText())!=null) {data+=buf+"\n";}       io.closeText("read"); return data;     }     public int getTop() {      return top;      }     public int getTok() {      return tokenCount;      }     public int[] getWordCounts() {      return wordCounts;      }     public String[] getWords() {      return words;     }     // action method that does the analysis     public void doCount(String msg)     {       String tokDelim=" \t\n\r\f,.;:~!@#$%^&*()+={}[] /\"";       String buf=new String(),token=new String();       StringTokenizer st; buf=msg;       st=new StringTokenizer(buf,tokDelim);tokenCount...       while (st.hasMoreTokens()) // make sure there are words to count       {         token=st.nextToken().toLowerCase(); // get token & decase         // now search the array for existing occurance of word         Boolean found=false;         for (int idx=0; idx<=top; idx++)         {           if (token.equals(words[idx]) ) // is it in list already              { wordCounts[idx]++; found = true; idx = top + 1;}         }         if (found == false)            {words[top] = token; wordCounts[top] = 1; top++;} // new word       }     }     public void runReport()     {       DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat("00000"); //fixed posn       SimpleDateFormat sdf=new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy MMM dd @ hh:mm");       Date date = new Date(); String rptDate = sdf.format(date);       TextIO io = new TextIO();       File fo = new File(outFileName); io.openText(fo,"write");       for (int idx=0;idx<t;idx++)     // display the results         {io.writeText(df.format(wc[idx])+"  "+w[idx]);}       io.writeText("-------------------");       io.writeText(df.format(tok)+"  words in text!");       io.writeText(df.format(t)  +"  unique words in text!");       io.writeText("!"+"wcPlus report created on "+rptDate+"\n");       io.closeText("write"); isRpt = true;     }     public void runFile(String s, String d)     {       inFileName=s;outFileName=d; // source and destination       intext = getData();         // get contents of WS       doCount(intext);            // let class do the work       tok = getTok();t=getTop();  // fetch the results       w = getWords(); wc = getWordCounts();       runReport();     }     public void showRanMsg()     {    if (isRpt) {System.out.println("Report has been created");}     }   }      thks...
