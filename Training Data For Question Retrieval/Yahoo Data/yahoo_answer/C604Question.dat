20090202214210AAQvMmi	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How should a wedding photographer dress?	I've been asked to be the wedding photographer at my sister's wedding next year, and have no idea how to dress.  I'm personally inclined to dress for comfort, considering I'm going to be up, down, and around everyone, and on my feet most of the time (and not being the one getting married).  My mother is a little leery about that idea, and so I'm wondering what the convention is for these things?
20090202214158AA40WTw	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Cannot attend son's wedding after years of no contact?	since My divorce 4 years ago my ex is still bitter this has divided my children  who are grown .against me........I have been basicly ignored except for a birthday or christmass phone call or card.Now my youngest may marry and I  do not feel I want to attend.

20090202214311AAwsY0w	Family & Relationships;Family	My girlfriend yells at me all the time, but I yelled back and she cried.?	Okay, this has been on going on for a while.      Basically, my girlfriend screams and gets in my face all the time, and I'm supposed to lay back and take it.  I'm not going to bore you with a long story, you can read my other question if you want to read it.      Today, while helping her, she screamed in my face.  And deep down, I flipped out and fought back.  I got back in her face hastily and yelled right back.  She then quickly ran to my bed and cried for nearly an hour.  She told me I was the only boyfriend she ever felt like I could hit her or cause her physical harm when I flipped like that.      I felt terrible, but right now, I'm not feeling terrible at all.  She screams at me and normally every 2-3 days I'm the one crying because she insults me and puts me down all the time.  I don't understand what I'm supposed to do.      Do I sit there and take the insults and physical harm she inflicts on me?  (Yes, physical harm, I take it without fret for her, and I won't dare confess because I don't want to lose her.)      I just feel like she's hypocritical right now, I don't understand why she's allowed to flip out and make me cry all the time and then the only time I've ever lost control in this whole relationship she cried for an hour and then told me how ****ty of a boyfriend I was, basically.  Those aren't her exact words, but they sure felt like it.      What should I do?  I really need help =(.

20090202214520AAh8lvQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does our attorney have an obligation to tell the opposing party every step that is planned?	My husband has sought help from an attorney.  The first paperwork sent was contempt of court.  She threw a fit and he told us that he would inform her of all his intentions from here on out since she got so upset.  So if my husband decides to file court paperwork to proceed to the next level he intends to call her and let her know before she's served?  Is there something that says he has to do that or is it just my husband and I that think this is odd?  We asked the attorney about it and he just kind of ignored the question.

20090202214540AAWjxOa	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why am I too boring??Help?	I work at Domino's Pizza (I'm 17) and I feel that I am pretty boring there. My friend is always so open to all the co-workers. She makes them laugh and she is probably the reason they love going to work and listen to. She always has funny jokes, she whistles funny tunes while making pizzas, and she's the perfect girl out there, while I am just a girl who can be funny at times, but not as extroverted as my friend who works with me. I can never see myself being overly open as she would. I am soft-spoken and she is a loud person. She doesn't mind speaking her mind, whereas I have to think before I speak. I'm very polite, too polite actually and respect everything there. How can I be more fun at work? I want people to enjoy my company, but how? Thanks

20090202214755AAyS6jQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Who do you think is right ? [a relationship question for *Guys* to answer*]?	so i was discussing this guy with my friend and she keeps insisting that he likes me, me on the other hand is not that convinced. i was saying a few things hes mentioned around me or whatever and she still thinks he was dropping hints that he likes me. like the one time we were walking and he looked at me smiled and said ill race you to the parking lot, another time after class i went left he started to go right then said [and i heard him] ill go this way turned around and went the way i was going, in class he had his phone out and was like telling me about it and was telling me about t-mobile and stuff.. i think maybe he was trying to ask for my number? he usually smiled at me and look at me. then i told him i said i sucked in math and hes like dont say that .. you just need to believe in yourself more. actually i saw him at the mall with a bunch of his friends and we didnt even know each other then, i was just some girl in his class and he still smiled and said hi to me.. even though his friends were there. then i happened to see him again at the mall and i had my contacts instead of glasses and he still remembered and recongnized me. not that theres a big difference, but there is slight one. and he even said hi to me first. you get the idea. so being that your a guy [which is why im asking for a guys point of view] do you think shes right, being that he likes me or that im right [or if theres a possibility] that he doesnt like me?        im not looking for advice, or anything of that nature, i just want some insight from a guy about who would be right in this situation- my friend or i.

20090202220034AAwaLzv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do girls complain about there not being a decent guy?	I don't understand all the complaining and fuss. I will give them some leeway for certain people, such as jerks like David or Taylor, but they think not a single guy is any better than the rest. If they keep dating the same people that made a different person miserable from a previous relationship, I can't feel much sympathy if you had prior knowledge of the person.      I just can't get off the fact, though, that they stereotype the rest of us who are much better than the other people they seem to like better, even if they become emotionally upset after a date with them. It's become so bad, that not a single date has gone on for about 3 months in our school. Not a single one.      I don't much care for anyone else as long as they aren't upset for a long period of time. I only have eyes for 1 girl, but she listen to her friends of how bad they think EVERY guy is. I can't find a way to try to even form a relationship that won't be broken by her friends stopping it.      Even if there was an opportunity that would more likely succeed, I probably wouldn't grasp it, because I'm absolutely shy. I couldn't bring myself to ask her out because I'm afraid of rejection. Telling me to suck it up and take a chance doesn't help me get motivated, either.      Is there a way I could secretly warm her up to the idea of having a relationship with me? I don't want it to last just a month or anything at all. I want it to last a LONG time. I want to keep her happy and safe, and I want to be close to her and treat her the way a girl deserves to be treated. With love and respect.....

20090202215436AAtopVs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What the feck did I do wrong?	I just transferred to a 4 year college and live on campus. I met a girl that I vaguely knew from my hometown and I think she's gorgeous. She's single. One day she came over our dormitory and was just hanging outside and people got me to come out and chat with her. I stupidly brought up her high school days where she had this goth phase and she got very upset and stupid me I kept laughing about it. So I asked for an apology via facebook since she wasn't around for me to say sorry. She accepted the apology and a couple days later at a party we were talking to each other and joking around. The chemistry seemed like... on/off, but on her part and everyone tells me she's a bit shy. The whole party as I danced with other girls and played pong her and her friend would be talking and glancing over at me.       So I asked her out via facebook since I didn't see her again, to a night of bowling at the local alley and it's been two days she hasn't gotten back to me with a response. And everyone keeps pressuring me to talk to her and ask her out, etc... one of my buddies said we have similar personalities and we would make a good couple... and they know her better than I do... I don't know what's going on, did she blow me off? Is she super-shy? Even if she was dreadful of society, she wouldn't likely ignore a facebook message. What did I do wrong here?

20090202222127AAy2okC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why does everyone feel they need to "wait" until they are married?	Ive been hearing it all day, its irritating, what good can come from this? your inexperienced, you got your hopes up and for future reference you may marry some one who is infertile or worse yet allergic to your semen, every one talks about this greater bond, and bonding comes with time spent not doing the act. you want to know why you feel like your bonding? its because a hormone called oxytocin aka the "cuddle" hormone is released upon orgasm causing one to become more affectionate and nurturing. so what is the big deal?

20090202220712AAOXlRe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ideas to ask her out on Valentines Day?	My best friend and I have been seeing eachother ALOT on valentines day. We had a little dispute about a week ago, which she ended up saying that I need to seriously back off and that I try to hard. I will admit, that I was clingy... but that kinda hurt, cuz Ive been planning to ask her out on Valentines Day since before Christmas. Lately, Ive been acting "weird" to her... her friend says. Her friend is sending me FWD texts of everything she says about me.. and she says she think she really likes me, but is scared.. because she feels that I like another girl from work who I mentioned once or twice when we hang out. Which I saw she saw a bit of jealously.      I wanna make her feel that Im just another friend of hers now, and then come valentines day. Im gonna take her out to her favorite restaurant and ask her to be my girlfriend. Im little nervous though. I just want everything to go well. And still confused how to bring it about.      When and how should I ask her. My orginal plan is to take her to dinner, and then just drive around. Stop somewhere (where I had aleady spelled out "Will you be my girlfriend?" in the snow)... pretend that I had just found a lighter. Showoff infront of her with the lighter. "Like ooooh, look wat I can do" by swiping my finger in the flame. And then be like "OUCH! SOB!" and go down on one knee. Her reflex will be to hunch over and see if Im alright, and she will grab my hand. With my other hand, I will flick the switch and light up the sign. I just dont know if lighter fluid will work ontop of snow? If it doesnt, I need some ideas please.

The theatre was really the only place I ever felt at home and accepted. I made a lot of memories as well as lifelong friends there. SOOOO anyways some creep came in and painted a big pot leaf over it all as well as a penis and a bunch of vulgar words and changed all our fond memories to dirty phrases and now they're painting over all of it. And just as I was telling a friend he told me I was being ridiculous and should not be upset about high school things and to get over it.      Is it irrational for me to be upset about this?

I am going through a divorce. so when he asked me to spend the night, I said I can't because I am not divorced yet(my husband working in another city) and i dont want to let other ppl know(i have a roomate). i never invited him to my house for the same reason. actually he doesnt know where exactly i live (we hang out at his house all the time). i never introduced him to any of my friends. he kept wanting to change that but i kept rejecting him. a week ago he told me its better i never spend the night in his house.   today he told me he thinks im dishonest and lies here and there, and my behavior is bizarre and im not ready for a relationship. im not dedicated to our relationship and we may not be the one for each other. when i ased him what he wants to do he said he is not sure but he wants to take a break for a couple of days (he likes to take little break when we have fights).    this time it seems pretty bad. would you feel that way if you were him? does he want to break up? any way i can save the relationship? i really love him.
20090202222224AARHuL6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think most married men will steer away from a female coworker/friend who flirts?	I don't, as they probably want the attention & think there is no harm in just innocent flirting from the woman.  Of course if the female hit on him I think then the man would steer away unless he was a jerk.  I think most decent men will just accept the flirting, but not flirt back unless they're unhappily married.  They probably don't want to be rude to a friend who flirts.  I personally would stay away from a guy who was flirting with me, because I'm happily married & I would be turned off from a man who was flirting w/me, unless I was attracted to him & wanted to cheat.  Thanks.
20090202222229AAQtKvP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Met a girl and lost her number. How can I track her down?	I was at a bar a few nights ago and met a girl.

She gave me her phone number and for some reason I couldn't find it in the contacts on my phone the next day (alcohol may have had something to do with that part).       Anyways, I'd really like to track her down but don't know anything relevant to finding her other than the area she lives in and her first and last names. I live in a big city and have tried looking her up through the phone book but there are a lot of entries with the same name... and it's more likely she'd given me her mobile number.

20090202222255AABR62U	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I need help making a big decision in my family's life!!!?	We have been married for 17 years. I try very hard to be a great wife and mother. I keep a very clean house, I cook and even make my husband breakfast very early in the morning. We go to church, our kids are great. They are active in school and with friends. All three are good students. My husband an I are active in several things together and yet we have our own time to. I work part time and volunteer some to. My husband has a very good job, so money in not a problem. Now for the most interesting part. I'm his third wife, he has three older children with his first X. None with the second. He cheated on them, and they also cheated on him! About two years ago he told me that he had been having an affair, and really cared for this women. He moved out and lived with her for a few months. I never gave up and he came back home. I now think that he is having another affair. I really don't have proof but deep in my heart I just feel like he is??? What should I do??   Will he ever stop???
20090202222300AAjsYXE	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Im confused with my relationship right now.Honestly I don't know what to do.?	We've been together with my current boyfriend right now for 4 years. And yesterday he bursted out to me that he want to settle down, look for a house and get married with a little wedding ceremony with closest friends and family. But what confuses me is that I'm really sad with the good news. One more thing, he added up that we have to live with his mom because his mom is and dad are really not okay. That means her mom got to live with us. What made me sad is, I've waited for this moment to come that we'll gonna build our own family because we worked so hard for this moment to come, then all of a sudden he's gonna get his mom to live with us. For me, its not a good idea even he said that his mom likes me a lot and get to help me in household chores like going to market,cook food for us. It is not fair because what's the use of having his mom live with us? I mean its not that I'm selfish there are just some things that it's better for us to be alone together because we are already grown ups right? I'm really confused. I really do not know what's with his mother, why does she have to do that? Does that mean she doesn't trust me? Even if we goes out shopping or going to church she is with us acting as if her son's chaperon. It's hurting me seriously. I respect his son as my boyfriend because he is really a good person. But sometimes I feel like the mother and two sisters were doubting me and hates me. I can understand if they are rich family in some sense, they may doubt me as a "gold digger" like in the movie "MONSTER-IN-LAW". But to be honest, my family is far more richer that theirs. I just don't like his mother chasing ang running after his son. My gosh my boyfriend is 30 years old already. Don't we deserve some privacy here?

20090202230639AA1WBbJ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What would you do in this situation (engagement ring) Diamond experts please!!!?	My fiance and I are going through a really stressful situation with my engagement ring, here it goes:      My fiance paid nearly 10,000 (au) for my engagement ring. It is a solitaire marquis cut with a very high colour (E - second best) and a good cut. The clarity was an S12 but the jeweler reassured us that the inclusions wouldnt be visible, as did the GIA diamond certificate!      Unfortunately after a while of wearing the ring, we realised we have been ripped off. there are black dots (refered to as 'black pepper') in the diamond fully visible and we paid 10,000 for this ring!!       We are soooo angry and upset, as its a really sensitive thing for me. I cant bare to see these terrible inclusions on a ring that my fiance paid so much for, i couldnt care if it was a cheap ring but we deserve better!      We have been given 2 options:   - get in another diamond with the same specs no visible inclusions (how can we trust it)   - get a refund      The problem is with a refund that it was a rare design my engagement ring the setting and i know i wouldnt be able to replicate it :( but how can i trust his word?      If anyone lives in Sydney and could give me a good place for high quality diamonds and rings to go to that would help heaps!!      I am really upset and i would like to know what would you do???

Hi everyone      a while ago  on new years eve i met this guy we started hang out ever since and one time we went to his place and ever since we started being intimate. like the fourth time. we had a lot of connection and had  a lot of fun together we would laugh at jokes he would laugh really hard at my jokes and there was just a lot of chemestry between us         One time he asked me if i wanted to be his gf but everything we did was being intimate at his place, he never took me out or anything he was a really bad paying job which is probably why he doesnt take me anywhere, he usually hang out at this place and are intimate and watch movies, play games etc      i make him laugh a lot, but one time i realized i felt empty so i broke up with him and told him it was over after a while i got kicked out of my place and went to stay with a friend for 1 week. he called me a lot and i told him what happened. why i wasnt home etc.      later......we hung out the next day i came back from my friends house.   we were intimate again, and we decided to meet the next day   he calls up the next day and tells me that he cannot meet me cause his mom and sis are staying over (he lives with his dad and his mom and sister have their own lives, and live on their own) so i doubt what he told me was true.       anyway i was like ok ...we can chill tomorrow he called me the next day and i turned him down telling him i couldn't do anything ..then he called me the next day and i turned him down again.      is that ok? im playing hard to get cause i really dont know what he wants from me, is it just sex? does he really like me and is scare cause i broke up with him? what should i do? should i leave him? what do you guys think?

20090202222358AA1ktuI	Family & Relationships;Friends	What's wroung with me and why am i so weird...?	I'm a 15 year old boy, currently in grade 10. No real hobbies other than playing guitar. My issue is, I'm really mentally immature? I don't know. I still laugh at the stupidest things, i'm thinking because maybe i really don't laugh alot? I take life pretty seriously, if not, too seriously. So i'll maybe laugh like once a month. The problem with this is, i'll laugh at the stupidest times. For example, while in class overhearing an odd conversation, or during an instructional video... You know, i really try not too, but you can't hold back sometimes. I've also found that i am socially awkward? I'm really shy, and unless i'm talking technical with somebody, i find i begin to bring up the strangest subjects. In my school, more than i care to remember i have been called a "Creeper". I am assuming this mean a stalker, but i never have really stalked anybody. In fact, i tend to ignore people. Once in the cafeteria, a group of girls looked over to me and shouted " Creeper" so in reply i shout, " Don't flatter yourselves." Yeah, obviously a bit disrespectful, but all in all i think they had it coming to them. So am i weird or what?

I've been dating a guy for six months now. He was my first true love. The first few months were amaaaazing, he showed me sooo much happiness. But then things started going wrong, first i found out some big lies he had told me but i forgave him because i truly loved him and wanted to give him another chance. then i found out about a few lies he also had told me (i found these ones out about 3 weeks ago.) I mean they werent HORRIBLE lies or anything and im not really sure if its worth dumping him over, but I have become a depressed person because of them just because I was hurt badly by the one i love.      ever since ive discovered these lies my life has been a lot sadder. Other stuff has also affected our relationship (my mom is sick, i havent seen my dad in months, and other stuff) and its made me ever sadder and harder to repair. before when i dealt with crap i just looked at the bright side of having him, but now i just feel sad because all i can think about are the lies.      PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!

20090202223247AAdqIEk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend problems please help....?	Ok currently my boyfriends lease is up March 31st of this year. So from March to about middle of July or August at latest he needs a place to stay because around that time he will hopefully have this other job and be moving then, but they dont hire til July so that is why he cant move til then to see if he gets it.    So I have been trying to look for places that he could move to for those 3 or 4 months and have found a few just need to call to get a bit more detail. But he said he may just live with this guy friend of his for those months. But the thing is I really dont like this friend of his, I mean hes been nice to me the few times Ive met him, but he drinks like everyday and has had 3 duis and I just dont think its a good enviornment. Plus Id rather bf live alone to see if we can move in together by next year and itd help if he lived alone if I am there and we see how it goes. So what do I do I have told him that I dont really want him to live with anyone and he said he didnt know final plan yet. Also as a side note bfs roomate now really doesnt like me a ton so even if this guy he lived w/ was his best friend if I was there a lot may not like it.       side note: why does bf get mad when I ask if roomates gf was there or if my bf had seen her? he doesnt like her so doesnt talk to her really but gets mad if i ask bout her or the rm sometimes.

20090202222424AASM2Gh	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do you stop liking someone who you cannot avoid?	I apologize for asking such a cliche and childish question, but I really am at a loss for advice on this. Most of the answers I've found are, "Just avoid him/her for awhile" and that is not an option.      There is a girl on my floor in my duplex at school who I see everyday, and I've become quite smitten with her the past couple of months. We've been good friends for a few years, and better friends in the last year, hang out often, eat with everyone else on the floor, and just talk every other day or so. I told her how I felt, it was not mutual, and I can understand. We still hang out just as much, and avoiding her isnt really an option, but at times it gets very excruciating.      What are my options for getting over her, and going back to being able to concentrate on my work and studies, and just generally being happy when she's not around?

20090202223301AAkPLhD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Having relationship problems Who do I choose?	so the situation is i was in a relationship with my ex for 2 years he has two children ages 4 and 2 1/2 so while I was with him I raised his children as if they were mine. His children's mom was in prison for most the time for drugs. So any way she got out of prison and my ex decided he wanted to sign her parole papers so she moved in with her and put me on the back burner to help her out so I broke up with him because i felt like he should have put me first. So we have been broke up for 5 months now and I am in a new relationship with someone else we have been dating for 2 months now and I really like this guy a Lot but my ex wants me back. I want to make the right choice but i just cant seem to make it. So I need advice My ex is very financially stable and I know I won't have to worry about anything with him he says he wants me to move in and us to be together and that he made a mistakes and promises to fix it.

20090202223408AALHysZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So do you think about this as a missed opportunity? Did I really miss out?	So this occured about 2 yrs ago. Met this guy in an elevator we both smiled, at each other, spoke a bit and even laughed at his joke. and then 3 mths later sees him working on my unit. he smiles at me and acts as though he recognizes me, but I thought that to be wierd at first b/c in the back of my head I was just like who on earth would remember someone from so long ago. So I generally acted as though I didn't know him. And totally ignored him, b/c I though he was a wierdo. Which was so unkind of me.  Anyway, he continues to smile with me and be around wherever I was.  He kept doing this for wks to mths later not giving up. Until one day I finally gave in. He just stood at a distance and started staring @ my name tag. I kept looking at the computer screen and then finally l looked up and he said that I had a long last name. Came over, fully introduced himself, asked me my name about twice and shook my hand. So converstion started and that was that. Didn't see him until about a wk later when I was busy doing something and when he came up to my unit stood outside the door and I totally ignored him. Only b/c this time I was shy and afraid. And then too I really don't know his intentions of me. Is he just being friendly. etc.    So yeah I am a totally shy individual. but I did'nt mean to act like this. Still dosen't give up b/c each time i see him. Its like he recognizes me from a distance without me even knowing that he was there and even if he is busy always took the time to smile at me, say hi and how I was doing. I really taught that he was different after the fact that people think that I look unique and exotic to even approach and even taken. So to cut a long story short, he continues to do this for weeks and mths, later disappearing and reappearing in my life turning red and blushing evertime he sees me,. We even bump into each other on my days off. Which was kind of a coincidence. like @ the library and even while driving. I felt as if God was trying to lead us together,since I was praying to find someone. Since i've never dated or been with anyone or even had a b/f.etc. and this guy came along. But then sometimes I would also notice that he would turn his back to me at times and ignore me too. So anyway I did some research on him, found out that he was married before and divorced, that he may have cheated on his ex-wife, or she might have cheated on him, not sure, that he was a major player, partyer, and clubber and cheated on many other girls. Although this kind of turned me off a bit,I didn't seem to juge him, its just that he gave me a lot of attention.even though I knew this I wanted to see what would happen. My parents especially my mom and sister warned me to stay away from him and even friends. He never asked me out though or even dated. Its like he just kept coming around, turning reds, looking at me in a way I can't even describe was mind boggling to me. He even dated one of the girls in my dorm and I even saw them together. I felt kind of hurt a bit especially when I taught that he might of been interested. Then one day he comes around again, this time with a colleague and turns bright red almost like a lobster and smiles and me and asks how I was doing. I just said okay. And looks toward his coworker since I kinda know him ( his coworker) and acknowledges him as well. He who recognizes this walks ahead in front of him and blocks my view no joke. and then walks directly up to me in the face but I ignore him again and continued to type on my computer. I acted this way b/c I was just fed up after having him not do anything after a year, just say hi, turn red and nothing more.  thought that was the end of that, but then he totally resurfaces when I went to the grocery one night and stands behind me in the cashier line. I looked to him acknowledged him and really smiled but I was on the phone talking with my mom.  The next time I saw him was about 1mth later and he turns his back to me and does not look. and that was the last time I saw him. The next that I heard of him was that last yr, he had found a g/f and now is married as of about two mths ago.    This is how I felt. I felt crushed, like I thought that he would magically reappear in my life again and this time do something, after playing all these games, and have me wondering what he wanted in the first place. I really felt, as if I lost out, what if he was the one despite his past, not judging him, I mean I really started to feel something especially after he kept coming around. I mean was he even interested? Was I not good enough to be asked out by anyone? This even has me wondering what on earth could he have wanted in the first place. Why did he come around? and around me. and why he acted the way he did? Did he feel anything?  How could he be so mean? I really felt as though he messed with my personality and feelings a bit. And a bit lead on.  And in this case I really feel as if I lost out on him b/c in my case everyone else thinks tha

20090202223434AAJTvYJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Bf just lost his job...?	we've dated for about 2 years and he just lost his job. the problem is he has a felony from about 10 years ago (at 19). it was never a problem because he's always had good employment but his company just laid off a lot of people. he has a college degree in engineering, but it seems no one will hire him. the problem is that he was supposed to meet my family this month... we've been engaged 6 months now. i was going to tell my parents about his past, but now... not so much, because they will just see a loser without a job, no matter how much they liked him before (via phone conversations and things i've told them)... any advice?
20090202223446AAtYXDr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it wrong to date right now?	I've never met him before, but him and my friends have met... so it's not that weird, he's deployed in the army, and doesnt come back til a few months. he's exactly what i've been lookking for. we webcam/chat a lot.. whenever he has free time that day, there isnt a day we dont talk, and he randomly IMs me telling me he's thinking of me. it sounds stupid sometimes to me that i say we're dating when we've never met, and then i ask myself questions like: "what if i meet the guy im suppose to be with while hes gone" or "what if i don't like him when he comes back" or "does this make me look desperate or something?"       idk how to explain what i'm feeling, because i don't even know myself. but from what i know, i like him. and my friend is saying all these harsh things, and i just don't know waht to think of this all.       any opinions?

The guy is married but the contacts are mainly by email. Once or twice a month or even weekly, we have always had this friendly attraction going on in which we used to share thoughts, jokes, pics, etc. He says he enjoys our friendship and communications.      He also says he likes to hear from me. He's military and so his wife and he have always talked about family and I feel he's happy. Recently, I asked if I could added him in myspace and he said yeah. So I added him and finally saw his pictures with his wife and his kids from a previous marriage. He looks happy and that he loves his wife and kids. Well, since I added him I haven't heard from him, I wondered if me adding him might changed something.      I really see him as my friend now that I know his family, I want to think that was mutual. What do you think happened? Should I send him a note commenting something, since I haven't as well.

20090202225401AAWzfcJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I break up with her?	I recently began dating a girl from home - we're both in college now. We've only been going out for like a month, but we both have felt like we should have been going out for much longer than that, and I think the feelings between us are genuinely love.      However, I just got into a huge fight with her last night over the distance issue. She goes to a community college at home, while I go to a private college a thousand miles away. She's been hinting that I should transfer to be closer to her, but finally asked me to transfer straight out last night. I really don't want to, so I said no, and it just went downhill from there. She obviously feels like I don't value the relationship, but I told her no reason at all could possibly make me transfer, even her.      I don't know what to do about this. I almost feel like if she's gonna be like this, then I don't want to be with her. I'm seriously considering breaking up with her over this. She clearly doesn't respect my decision not to transfer, and I honestly don't think she can handle being without me. She spends her nights at home while I'm gone drinking herself to sleep. She's also being a burden on my social life here - she expects me to talk to her almost constantly, to the point where it is difficult to do anything else with my friends here at college. I think the problem is that she's madly in love with me, but I'm don't feel as strongly about her, and she seems to be a really clingy person, to the point where she literally needs to have someone else to cling to in order to get by, and she's picked me, but I'm not actually there so she's breaking down.      What do you think I should do?

20090202230445AADqDvb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If you love somebody should you tell them?	If one person can give me good advice I'll be grateful. I love somebody I went out with before, but we broke up but then, months later, we got the chance to be friends again. We got put in one of the same classes, so we're friends now and we get along pretty cool. I still love him, but I never let him know that. But now the semester is almost over so I feel like this is my last chance to say anything to him about anything at all. I feel like I may regret things I never said to him. Also after we broke up we stopped talking even though we hung out at the same place, but thinking back, I think that it may have been my fault mostly. I want to address that, but I don't know how.      Also last week it was weird but I swore under his breath I heard him say what sounded like "I ******* love you" I asked him and he was like "...nothin." But also last week what was a little different was that he said he enjoys these conversations, that I'm funny. Or he wanted me to bring my guitar so he could show me how to play a song. I'm not sure if that means anything, its hard to tell with him. Also I happened to bring my guitar last friday and he asked me if I knew this song...I remember a year ago when we were going out he played that song. But I don't know if he remembers that.      Also it's weird but people in our class thought we we're going out. Separate people asked us if we we're going out and said that we should. Apparently we're like "perfect"...      What should I do? I don't know what I should say or not say, I just want to have no regrets.

We went out for about 3months solid in any one "go," but we've dated on and off for the last 4~5 years. I still think she's very attractive and I still like her a lot, but the feelings aren't mutual, she doesn't feel the same way about me and she's made this very clear to me. I want to try and move on, because where I am right now is causing me too much pain and unhappiness.

20090202230931AAmRS2I	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would a girl call me to hang out, then blow me off?	Most of the girls I know call me and talk to me like totally randomly.  We make plans to chill later that week, then when the day comes they blow me off.  I've tried calling them, tried not calling them.  Like I tried caring about it and chasing them for a while.  When that doesnt work I tried not caring for a while, thinking that maybe when I back off a bit it will draw them in. They obviously just dont care.  Im not a freak, Im reasonably good looking, I have goals, I'm nice but not a wuss.  I can make a girl laugh, I can hold on an intelligent conversation...  Now, all that being said: I'm 25 and the girls I seem to attract are 18, 19, 20.... they end up being flings that jus pop in and out.  By the same token though my good friend Lindsay jus turned 19 and she is dependable.  So why would a girl call me, ask me to hang out with her at a later time, and blow me off???  Doesnt make sense to me...

20090202232238AAozksJ	Family & Relationships;Family	Do women want the alleviation of all the negatives in regard to women's social sexuality?	..yet keep hold of all the positives? For example, I hear women complain often about the negatives: being called s luts, not being taken seriously at times, guys cat- calling on the street etc..  yet I don't hear women often complain about the positives: getting more positive attention, less effort required in meeting suitors, ability to parlay this desirability into financial gain etc.. .      So is the idea here that women would like society and especially men to get rid of all the negatives, yet women would still like to keep the positives? - Ultimately meaning that women would have an absolute advantage in this area with no compromise. (because if you wanted thing to be different yet overall equal women would complain on both sides of the equation, not just the negative, correct?)

20090203000611AASKKiQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Women: what are some features you associate with an approachable guy?	In American society a guy has to court the female. He has to initiate first conversation with the girl, and basically move the whole interaction in the first stages of the relationship.      I was having lunch with a female friend of mine and she says she feels sad for men, because they are the ones who chase the female. She said she would be terrified to just start talking to some guy and only some girls have enough strength to do that.      I complemented her on recognizing the problem. Her argument for girls not chasing was not because it would make her look slutty or desperate, but she just likes the chase. She said she wants him to chase her until she feels satisfied with the chase.      But she does acknowledge, it takes great courage for the guy to initiate with the female.      Then we started to talk about what kind of girls are seen as most approachable to guys. I gave her a quick list: calm, logical, sweet attitude, non-bitchy, fair, easy going, confident, class/pride in herself, and at least decent looking.      I said that it's not just how the girl looks that determines how often she gets approached. It's how she carries herself. A good looking woman who has a bad attitude, loud, and brusque will get approached less than a woman who is fair, confident and kind. Also, an average women who has a bad attitude, loud, and brusque will get approached less than the good looking woman who is fair, confident, and kind.      Then I asked her to give me a list of qualities that may influence a woman so she would like to know the guy better after perceiving those qualities in him.      So ladies, I ask you all to please list your qualities.

20090202233921AAJyP3l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can I settle a party boy?	I went to my friends house and met his roomate who was really cute. The first time we just kissed and he took me to his room but I said that I should go and left. Then when I went over there again, we kissed again and this time he was trying to do more, feeling me up and stuff but I took his hands off. Anyway, my point is that I really like kissing him, but thats as far as I want to go, unless he wants a relationship but I dont think he does. He is a party boy but my friend tells me I am the prettiest he has ever been with and since I didnt sleep with him, like the other girls have, he will want me more. Also, my friends other roomate has a crush on me and so I flirt with him to get the other guy jealous. Is there any way I could get him to settle down with me? Or is this virtually impossible?

20090202231647AA3DjPa	Family & Relationships;Family	Any teen have these issues with their parents?	I am 18 and my relationship with my parents is "rocky" at best. What seems like an eternity ago, I did things that made my parents not trust me. Normal teenage stuff like lying, staying out at night ect. I remember my parents told me that since I broke their trust, it would be awhile until that trust was regained. What made me mad was that my sister Katie (she's my twin by the way) seemed to always have my parents trust and approval. She had her "trust" issues too, but my parents gave her the passwords to the TV, Computer, Internet, Home Security System, while denying me any of that. This was 100% degrading and humiliating when I had to ask my sister to turn on the computer or TV for me. I started to rebel against my parents. I bought my own laptop, car, and even switched to another bank so that my parnents could not check my account. Personally, I felt like I would never be able to regain my parents trust, so I stopped trying. Heck, I am about to move out, and I still don't have their trust. Today my mom asked me if she could use my car to run some errands. I asked her where she wanted to take it, how long she was going to be gone ect. She told me that it was none of my business, and that she was more trustworth than me. I told her to give me my keys (cause that is what she would have done if I had said that to her), and she had to use Katie's car. I don't feel like aerning my parents trust becacus i figure "what the heck, by the time that they actually trust me, I'll be 30". Does any other teen feel like this? For parents that want to comment, don't say, "well you deserved it, or your parents are only doing what's best for you". Yes I get that, but I want to see how many other teens are in this position.      Thanks for the responses.      Cory

My ex-wife stayed in the UK for over a year, and I thought she would come back to the USA. She did not and instead filed for divorce in the UK and got remarried. Her plan was to leave me for her boyfriend back in the UK when her father passed away because our marriage was an arranged marriage. I went through the USA children's affair and got legal representative . My ex wife would battle me with everything and she would do everything to prevent me from seeing my children. Las summer, the judge said there may be a possibility that the children can come to the United States to only visit, but my ex wife was adament against that. She got a cascaff involved in the case. The official UK male bashing organization against men. After battle the UK courts for 5 years, the UK judge rendered an order stating that I can never see my children again and I can not speak with them over the phone. He also said I can not appeal this decision. The basis of this decision is that the mother has manipulated my children to tell a UK CAFCASS social worker that they never want to see me again, and the judge complied with this. My son is 10 years old and my daughter is 7 years old. My ex wife married a fundamental muslim who is brainwashing my children, the UK courts just relinquished my of all human fundalmental rights as a father, and I feel my country the United States has betrayed me and has not done enough.      I pleas need help and I am in immense grieving pain. I feel as though the UK courts told me to think of my children as being dead because they wont let me call my children.       I never did anything to hurt my children and prior to this I had visited them several times through a court order and I was extra gentle and kind with my children , so this social report is fabricated with lies and deceit.      I m going to post this everyday until someone can help me...Ive called the media, an attorney, the district attorney's office, and left a message with my congress man. I am not giving up and I hope maybe someone reading this will give me good advice to get my children back      TO ALL WOMEN THAT HATE MEN OR SOMEHOW RELATE THIS STORY TO WHAT EVER EVENTS THAT HAPPEN IN YOUR LIFE THAT PROMPTS YOU TO LEAVE VERY HURTFUL AND NEGATIVE POSTS....I WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT MY INTENTIONS ARE NEVER TO TAKE AWAY MY CHILDREN FROM THEIR MOTHER..MY INTENTIONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH MY CHILDREN..I STILL STAND BY THIS... BUT THE EX WIFE DOES NOT WANT ME TO BE IN MY CHILDREN'S LIFE AND WILL LIE AND DECIET ABOUT EVERYTHING...SHE IS TELLING MY CHILDREN THAT I AM NOT THE FATHER AND HER NEW HUSBAND IS THE FATHER....I JUST WANT MY CHILDREN TO KNOW THEIR EXTENDED FAMILY ON MY SIDE OF THE FAMILY...MY CHILDREN ARE THE ONLY GRANDCHILDREN TO MY PARENTS AND MY FATHER IS LOSING HIS SIGHT AND I JUST WANT HIS TO SEE HIS GRANDCHILDREN BEFORE HE LOSES HIS SIGHT...
20090202231758AAGkBpm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend and I.?	Okay i have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year now.. however i told her i wanted to go on a break. The reason i told her this is because she pretty much told me she was too good for me. cursed me out because i wanted to get a new job.. and told me if i become friends with my buddy that she doesn't like again.. i can kiss this relationship goodbye.. all that really hurt me and idk what to do now. She said she was sorry and that it will never happen again. but in the past she has said bad stuff to me and said sorry then as well. What would you do if you were in my situation? I feel she really loves me.. however she can be mean mean mean at times.

I'm in college, and whenever he calls, he tries to manipulate me into being something I'm not. At the moment he lives 2000 miles away in Hawaii (he moved there the day I went to college). I've tried to accept him as my dad, and appreciate him, but deep down I know that I hate him. Do I have a right to be like this?

20090202233724AAj6YHA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	When u decided to get married to a guy, did u ask him how many girls he dated in the past?	Well I didn't, and today i found out he had quite a colorful past and it's killing me from inside. He told me about one girl when we were seeing each other, that he got engaged to but then it turned out that she had a mental condition, so it was called off. He didn't tell me abt any other, now i found out today that he had not only one but many and there was this one in particular that he was on n off with. He keeps telling me it wasn't anything serious but they were on n off for two years and that's driving me crazy. I don't know what to do :-(
20090202232719AAbKFg8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did I ruin everything?	Hi!   I hope that someone will answer this, because I've been contemplating about this situation for too long.      This guy used to frequently talk to me during our open period about history class. It started out small at first, with him asking how hard a test, essay prompt, etc. was. And then gradually, we started working on the homework together over AIM as well as the phone. He's also in my calculus class, and he used to wait for me after class so we could walk and talk together after class. He used to look at me during class too; when I turned my head to check the time, he would do the same.      Things were going really smoothly until I (jokingly) accused him that he was using me for history class (because I have the class earlier in the day; he has the class later in the day, so I thought that he was trying to get test questions out of me). He seemed to take it seriously, and even though I apologized, we haven't talked since then. It's extremely obvious that he goes out of his way to ignore me around school.      Did he really like me? Is he hurt/mad?   Or was he really just kissing up so I would give him test answers for history?      Thanks so much!

20090202232840AAnqWvc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Any Suggestions On what I Should Do To Fix This?	Ok, i've been talking to this guy since around the end of december of 08, and we been talkin ever since. we are getting pretty close not all in love but just close. but there's one thing or should i say person who interferes. my sister. she is so nosey, and she wants to think we're all close and stuff but we're not. i mean i love her to death but don't get me wrong. she texts him and wants to hang out with him like she his best friend and she not. she doesn't even have enough respect to at least ask and see if i dont mind that she hangs out with him... i know he gay and with me but why she gotta be all up in the bizz? and he makes me mad cuz he talkin bout " oh i wanna get to know you from a family member's side" and all this. and i told him if he needed to know anything about me to ask my mom, she know everything about me for him to get to know me from a different side of view. i dunno i just get so aggravated because she just wants to be all up in it. it's pissin me off?  and i get mad and end up taking out on him because i have already told him once that she's a liar and two-faced? hmmm im just so confused on how to react or feel about it?
20090202232857AAlyrp0	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm very shy and quiet..?	And I have difficulties making up small conversations..   I moved into a new school in a new country and I'm finding it hard to make friends. I've been at this school for a few years already but I barely have any friends. People do make fun of my accent which makes me want to talk less. And in classes, I find it hard to talk to the person next to me.. I even feel bad for them having to sit next to me because I'm sure I bore them everyday. I try making up small talk about common stuff about the subject but the conversations just die and we'll be left in awkward silence. I really envy those people who can fit in so well. I just want to be like everyone else. After being here for so long, I'm always hanging out with new students. I'm not saying that that's a bad thing but I just thought I could settle in.
20090203000237AAJE4pF	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm sick of everything and everyone, need a new life with new people?	I'm sick of going to my school and I'm sick of the people in my grade who look at me like I don't deserve friends and snub me off. Even when I talk and try to be nice they just don't care what I have to say or look at me funny.       I've been through more stuff than they will experience in their lifetime and I'm sick of being treated like I deserve to be alone.      I need a new city with new friends and need to get away. Problem is I'm doing year 12 and I have to stay in school for another year. I've gotten advice on here to just wait it out, but I have to sit through another 600 or something recess and lunches feeling like the most lonely person in the world, even though I'm sitting in a crowd.      Its day 3 or something and its doing my head in. I've put up with this for 2 and something years but now its just ridiculous.

20090202233218AA4TNpG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When do you know it's time to move on?	I've been in a "it's complicated"/"dating" (yea, terrible term I know) since last summer and it's definitely going nowhere. The problem is before all this he was one of my best friends and now he's just a jerk. I still have feelings for him but when do you know to just move on? I know we both still feel something but is it just better to end it now while we can still cut our losses and try to pull together the remains of our friendship or keep going and probably end up hating one another and losing the friendship, with the hope that it might turn into something serious?     And I feel very odd asking this question on the internet :/
20090202233729AAGeMkh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can someone give me an answer?	this guy i'm in love with ended it between us 7mo. ago.

So i asked why he has treated me like i was invisible & crap on the bottom of his shoe ever since & he said whether i believed him or not that he was hurting to & thought it was best to make a clean break. He said we could try to be friends & we talk a few days later for about 20min. about really nothing just work. He said he would call me to talk again the next day but than came up with some excuse why he couldn't now he is a vacation for 2 weeks. his he just playing a game with me or could there be another reason why it seems he lied? should i contact him when he gets back & ask what going on does he want to try to be friends or was just to appease me so he can say he talked to me. what should i do?

Did you do like I did? Hang out in front of a liquor store, (with money), and wait until some unsuspecting older person walked in but before that asking him nicely, then handing him money asking him to buy you one of the wines or liquors you had already chosen, and assessed the price for. It didn't take long before you had a bottle of wine. It's almost like hitchhiking... you just meet the most interesting people that way, and some can become friends.

She works at a local nightclub as a waitress. She says she's into Asian men and has date previous dates and boyfriends with them. It seems I match her type of guy. She also tells me that I look so sexy when I smile at her.      Whenever I see her, we talk very briefly, sometimes I buy her a drink, and we give each other a friendly hug whenever I step into the club and say goodbye. I stop by every once in awhile just to meet with her. She always tells me she misses me when I haven't seen her within a week or two.      Recently, she gave me her # so we can talk whenever we're not busy. However, I'm not sure if she gave me her # to talk casually or to make plans to see each other again. I'm kind of confused about this situation.      From what I observed, a question comes to me. Is she really interested in me? Is this a sign of a crush?

20070724143424AAJnh4g	Family & Relationships;Friends	Please help me. What do I Do?	I'm very soft-spoken, laid back, and importantly..being myself when I'm at nightclubs. I have 2 beautiful women whom I've been seeing for a few months. I like it when they're around me. I sometimes buy them drinks and talk to them for a short period. They said I'm nice very sexy when I smile at them.      Ever since the 1st woman (M-woman) gave me her # last month, we were able to speak a few times on the phone. When she's away or can't answer her phone, I always leave a VM for her to call back, and she did. When we're at the nightclub or talk on the phone, she's still the same person.      Ever since the second woman (D-woman) gave me her #, we always speak very shortly because she's busy at work, school, or out of town visiting girlfriends. So far she only responded to my call once. Since then, she's only nice when we meet at the club.      I respect and consider both women as good friends. Will I ruin my friendship with them if I choose who I like better or who I date first?
20070727201808AAi9PGg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get my girlfriend back?	So around November I knew this girl, and i liked her, and she seemed to show some interest in me. We started to talk, and then eventually became boyfriend and girlfriend. We were together for about 3 months, then she decided to break up. This crushed me, and I tried to get her back. After we broke up she was always being bitter around me and sarcastic, till one day i just gave up trying and made myself forget about her. it's been about 4 months now and it's becoming evident that she's begining to like me again. I might be wrong, but knowing her she does things very subtle, so i can sort of tell. She'll call my phone and when i answer she hangs up, and she does other stuff like that. I haven't seen her like in 2 weeks, but next time i see her i want to leave a lasting impression. Long story short, i want her to fall in love with me again, because I really really really love her. I need your help, please. Thank you.

Un figlio costa 1000 euro al mese? Bisognerebbe mettere un mantenimento minimo e un massimo.   Le leggi devono tutelare maggiormente l'uomo è tutta una farsa.   Poi dicono che le donne (la maggioranza non tutte a mio parere)guardano ai soldi. Ti credo se finisce male sei mantenuta a vita!

20080311074744AAxapUT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Age difference is it a problem in this situation?	Ok so i'm 17 and i'm 18 later this year and i really like this girl who's 14 ( 15 in a few months ). She likes me back but i don't think she's taking it to seriously.   We are meeting up for the 2nd time in a few weeks but sometimes she postpones it. At first i took it as "she doesn't like me so i'll move on", so then she said she wants to arrange something and she's really into me.    She doesn't want me to ask her out yet but i don't think she's taking it that seriously, she's not immature and neither am i...      So do you think that 14 - 17 is bad? After all its 3 years and soon to be 2 years difference which i don't think is an awful lot to be honest. Thoughts on that?       I get the feeling that it will bother her when i turn 18 and she being only 15, but i really wanna give this a shot! So any advice on how i can make her more serious with our relationship?      Thanks all for reading.

20090202234311AAozea4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can my boyfriend get over me throwing a drink near him in a fight?	Okay, so I just need some takes on my situation.       I stopped by my boyfriend of 2 years house after I got off work and we decided to go through the starbucks drive through. I was driving. While in the drive through he told me that he had deleted all the pictures on his phone ( it was my old phone - I gave it to him to use after he lost his). I asked if he had saved the pictures of my cat that just died and he said no. I was mad but not enough to fight about it. He asked if I was mad and I said yes ( I was still holding his hand btw so I wasnt that mad). He said he couldn't believe that something like this could come between us. He said "**** you...take me home, I don't want your ****." We got to his house and he just wanted to leave but I still wanted to talk, I was pissed that he had taken it there. It wasn't a big deal. He again said **** you let me go. He got out of the car and as he was walking to his door I opened my door and told him "at least take your drink (which I bought for him)" he said **** you no, and I chucked it at the ground behind him as he was walking away. He looked back and went in the house.       I called him after I got home and he told me that that made him hate me. That hes changing his number,  he wants to pick up his w2 (that I am filing for him) etc.       I guess I have alot of pent up anger about fights we've had that he always instigates. He's a drama queen. The situation didn't have to go there, and the fact that it did made me livid. We should be able to have a disagreement withought it being the death of our relationship. In addition, the hell that hes put me through (repeatedly breaking up with me to test me, telling me he doesnt love me anymore out of anger) is way worse than what I did.        I didn't mean to hurt him, or for it to even splash him (which it did, and it was a frap so it was cold). I love him, and just 2 days ago we had the best talk of our entire relationship. I don't want it to be over over something as minuscule as this.          Is this really unforgivable?

20090202235303AAUd9aH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy problems: A guy i have a crush on used to be nice, but now he's a jerk. Please help?	There is this guy that i have (or had) a crush on. He used to be so nice, funny, he would tease me a lot, and i felt comfortable around him. Now, he doesnt talk or tease as much anymore and i feel a bit weird around him. When he does talk, he sounds kinda rude. Like a few days ago, i said hi but he didnt say hi back. So i said, "You're so rude, you don't say hi anymore." I was kinda teasing so that he would tease back, but his response was "Why should i say hi?" and i couldn't tell if he was being a jerk or teasing.

20090203001520AAw7sHx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me? What should I do?	There is this really sweet guy that Is just so perfect. We have so much in common and I really like him. Every time I see him he comes and sits by me and starts talking to me, he picks on me, and he always wants me to take a pic on his cell, love's giving me hugs but he gives everyone a hug. His older brother likes me alot but he is a player and a jerk so I really don't like him, but he always picks on me. I don't know if that means anything. But my cousin which I don't know to believe her cause most the time she is wrong, she told me he didn't like me, just as a friend. And I wish I knew how to get him to like me. or maybe he does like me I just don't know how to find out.

20090203000314AAbawfc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I still fight for the girl... even if our first date just lasted 49 minutes?	okay.. so there's this girl... i'm really into her... we dated ones, and it only lasted really really really short, only 49 minutes since she said she has to leave and pick up her young sister.      who knows if her alibi is true... but giving her benefit of the doubt.      after that first date, without me texting her or something, she texted me saying "i had a great time, thanks! xoxo"      a week after, i asked a follow up ... 'hangout' with her... she said she's really busy, she has to get her nails done and visit her mommy... i told her well let me know if when you're free so we can go out again... *i thought maybe i sounded kinda clingy here*      so its been 2 weeks now, i never contacted her, totally no communication... coz im waiting for her to tell me bout her free time.  just to make her feel i'm not desperate over her... but you see i still think of her.. and hope that she would text or call me... but she didn't.      should i still fight for this girl?  is this the end of the road for us?  should i move on?  or is she just playing hard to get?  or she is just not into me?  i need your help.      2 weeks is 2 weeks... is it a bad duration not to contact her at all?  i left the ball on her court... but she never made an effort to contact me, not even a text.
20090203001338AAQ7ISA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	To Dream an impossible Dream ... is it an impossible dream to be with beautiful women?	I know i may sound really shallow... but you see i'm a small guy, i'm only 5'0" and people dont find me attractive. some girls find me cute, i dunno if they mean face wise or maybe about my whole stature which is small.      now i just would like to give myself some pride and trophy, so i'm going for really 'hot/gorgeous' women... i always gets rejected 100% of the time.      i know physically i may not be of a good match to them, but i know too that my financial stability and personality and kindness of heart equals their looks.      out of dozens of pretty women i 'targetted' only 1 agreed to go out with me on a date (i never force them though, i just ask em ones or twice then move on if they still say now). but it never did go to a 2nd date.      so far, everything just end up in frustration... i wanted beautiful women coz i believe this is a good reward for me for all the hardships i ever had. i want to have a kid that is sooo attractive just incase that kid will inherit my height... atleast i can give him/her something would make him/her be more accepted by the society.      honestly... do you think i'm trying to dream an impossible dream? i would rate myself 5 out of 10 or 6 out of 10 in looks... i dunno... please tell me. i know i'm shallow, please dont hate me... im just doing this to live a happy life and i could give my future kids good looks at the least.      thank you...      am i dreaming an impossible dream?

20090202235602AAY4PAb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can you stop a person from being so clingy?	I have a girlfriend, who I like but like less everyday. Everywhere I go she has to follow me, I go to the toilet, she has to go to the toilet. I brush my teeth, she needs to brush her teeth, She pretends to like all the stuff I like. She always agrees with everything I say. She has stopped seeing her friends and if I don't see her for one night, she thinks I don't like her anymore. I HAVE tried many times talking to her about this, she understands the problem and says she is trying to get better but really it just makes thinks worse, as she then thinks that I am mad at her and gets angry at herself. Once upon a time this was an interesting girl with her own thoughts and ideas and she was exciting and fun. Now she is like a shadow. I suppose I should end the relationship, but I am afraid of even doing that for how it will effect her. But at the moment I just want freedom and someone who will tell me what they really think....Any ideas??
20090202235721AAoLNwx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I kinda gave my girlfriend a shirt that had semen on it...?  What should I do? ?	When I went to Vegas my girlfriend wanted me to bring back a souvenir. Now my typical feeling is that Vegas really isn't a place that you buy souvenirs since mostly you go there to gamble and lose money and your real souvenir is a lesson about gambling.      I unfortunately forgot to get something though. But anyway I remembered a tshirt from a casino that I had back home so I decided to give it to her. I looked all around my room for the shirt and I couldn't find it. Until suddenly I realized exactly where the shirt was... and what I was "using" it for... A little personal cleanup if you will.      I ended up washing the shirt in the machine then giving her the shirt. But I still feel guilty a bit about it, should I try to replace the gift with something else? Or take back the shirt somehow?

20090203000206AApHABs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can you tell when you're in Love?	I've been with my bf on and off for almost a year now and we've basically broken up a million times because he's been caught talking to other girls online/texting etc. and possibly even cheated on me.  Although he lost my trust, for the past 4 months its been okay with us. I've tried to leave him for good so many times but, also I keep going back to him because, he just won't except us breaking up. I care about him so much, almost like a family member although we're sexually active and I really just feel like lovers. I don't feel like I'm in love with him deeply because I feel I can do better and I've held grudges from the past damage. Why do I feel confused. I don't wanna hurt him but, I don't feel like I love him like he loves me, only care for him deeply. Is it possible to care for someone and not be in love with them?
20090203000508AAWR9qj	Family & Relationships;Weddings	HOW LONG SHOULD I WAIT TO GET MARRIED OR ENGAGED?	MY BOYFRIEND AND I HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR 18 MONTHS. I KNOW I LOVE HIM AND HE IS THE ONE. MY CONCERN IS  WILL IT EVER HAPPEN! THE REASON I AM CONCERNED IS THAT HE IS 40 YRS AND NEVER BEEN MARRIED AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN FEARFUL OF MARRIAGE SINCE HIS PARENTS HAD SUCH A MISERABLE ONE.

20090203000841AAutLlV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Internet Crush, what should I do?	He lives in New York, and I live in Missouri. He messaged me for liking an obscure band. We have a very high music compatibility musically. We both are hispanic. We both like French New Wave, artsy fartsy stuff, and a lot of obscure stuff.        When he told me he liked a few obscure hard-to-find bands, I jokingly said, "WILL YOU MARRY ME?!" and he reponded, "**** YES I WILL MARRY YOU!"       We talked, but I'm the always one messaging/bothering him. He did message me for having the same movie still of a rare German movie, but idk, I mean, how do I approach him? Should? Or is it stupid??      We barely know each other and WE NEVER TALK TO EACH OTHER... So it might come off weird, but should I still message him?
20090203001017AAqFgOl	Family & Relationships;Friends	HELP please, I need to find my sense of place when im 18, should i do this!?	Im 17 and in my junior year in high school. I am going to be turning 18 over the summer in August and I'm really excited about the thought of it. I am working pretty hard currently these days with trying to maintain all A's in my classes and so far, so good. I live in a small little town and I'm trying to find a lot of things in my life, I need to go places when I'm older, I feel it to be a calling of some sort. That is why when I turn 18, I want to take a friend and go cross country biking for the remainder of the summer probably, and since I will be a legal adult right when this happens, my parents wont be able to force me to not do it, and they would not approve of something like that AT ALL, for obvious reasons (not being "experienced enough" to do things, etc etc). However, the point of the trip would be to find my sense of place and it's the way I want to do it. My question is, even if my parents wouldnt approve of that in the slightest, should i still do it if I feel like it'll make me happy and mean something in my life?

20090203002731AA8JmEN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I love my husband, but our sex life is...?	REALLY crappy! I know it's me. We can (and have) gone for months without sex. It doesn't even phase me. He on the other hand, brings up sex in half the conversations he has- mostly perverted jokes and gestures (such immature things as thrusting his crotch in the air or shaking his 'junk' at me) which I don't find attractive.      When we used to have sex. I would enjoy it best I can remember, but now... I have to have a few drinks in me to even have the patience to lay there and let him hump me. It sounds crude, but these words describe precisely how I feel.      I have that urge to have sex, but when it comes down to it... I don't want to and know I won't enjoy it.      I'm only 24 and we've only been married a little over a year.      What can I do to actually enjoy sex and actually have a sex life instead of almost falling asleep during the act (which has almost happened a couple of times)???

20090203012151AA1iS7X	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do I cope with feelings of being unloved and unappreciated?	Lately I've been feeling really unloved and unappreciated. It seems as if I hardly get noticed (save for at work). It's like I don't even exist or those that do acknowledge my existence just don't seem to care. It also feels as though I don't get enough thanks or acknowledgement for what I do (I teach advanced mathematics at a private high school). I just feel I don't get enough credit for what I do and how seriously I take my job.       Any ideas on how to cope with the feelings? Is it just clinical depression or something else? And please, no religious comments. Thank you.

20090203010541AAvJFwO	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Any advice for my boyfriend? (Long, appreciated if someone reponds though, thanks!)?	I've known my boyfriend for three years, we've been dating for 3 months. When he asked me out, I told him I would love to, but I couldn't handle some of his habits - mostly smoking pot all the time. He quit cold turkey that day, and hasn't looked back (he feels better physically and mentally, and the money he's saved instead of buying a dime he's very proud of). That's not a part of my question though, it's to give you an idea of what his life was like before.      Now.. He wants marriage, a house, kids, he loves me and my family, I have a half dozen nieces and nephews who goes to visit with me, he's offered my sister to babysit when he can so she can find work, he gets along with my Mom and all that stuff... But it's such a HUGE difference from what his life was like before - plus, when he goes back to work (auto industry, got laid off for two months, he's lucky to be going back so soon), he's taking over his supervisors position, and will be getting a partner position with the company. We've planned a budget, and are working towards savings for a house (I'm $4600 behind him in savings, so I'm working hard to catch up), he's working on some plans for his own business to start up within the next year or sooner - and he's going to do that as well as keep the job he has.      But.. He's kinda feeling lost he says, like he's out of control. I really think it's because he wasn't expecting all these things he wanted to come all at once, even though so much of it is what he planned for and wants, and his head is spinning with it all. It's a weight on him because he hasn't wrapped his mind around it yet or something.      Also, he doesn't actually start going back to work for another month, I think he's anxious and thinking way too much instead of just relaxing for now, he's going to be making himself very busy soon.      It's a huge change, it's all his own doing, lol, and I'm definitely supporting him however he needs so we can both achieve our dreams, but is there any advice out there for him, make this transition a little smoother, something to think about that will help him relax a little?

20090203005932AAI9Z0l	Family & Relationships;Friends	I screwed up... Can you please pray for me and my friends?	As you may or may not know... I really hurt my best friend whom I love, and I really hurt my other great friend. I made a stupid mistake; it was spur of the moment, something I never do; and I wholeheartedly regret it.      I cried all of Sunday night, all of Monday, and it's 3:35 AM Tuesday morning... I can't sleep, and I'm still crying.      The great news is that I've apologized to both guys, and they forgive me and still want to be friends. I'm so thankful for that. You have no idea.      So, I would greatly appreciate it if you could pray for my friends and for me and that everything continues to heal... Thank you... <3

20090203023849AA3SOAI	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I make my sister see, she is going to die?	Everything and every sugestion I have tried, she has an excuse for..     She has diabetes,heart problems, thyriod,enimia,over weight,water build up in lungs,and hig blood pressure.    I have told her her first thing is to start exersising,that would help with the heart,diabetes,high blood pressure,(her) "can't because of heart problems, doctor says no exersise.',    Take herbs for some illness(her),"can't because of taste"   Eat better 'Wont because of whatever...    The list goes on and on..plus she smokes on top of it all. She is only one year older than me..and I am as healthy as I can be..I try to be anyways.    She has every excuse there is.. I told her if a doctor ever told me..:not to exersise' he would be way gone.    She wont listen, and continues to do everything she shouldn't. What can I do. If I ever lost her, I think my world would crash. She is my everything, and no matter what I do, she lets it go in one ear, and out the other, I hate calling her, because she tells me the latest on her illness and her trips to ER..if i say somehting, she just washes it off, with things like ; "My doctor said" I am so sick of it..I want to call this Doctor, and let him have a few words, Or report him to the board, but I can't be sure if shes just saying it, or if he's really doing this to her.. She has a medicine cabinet full of drugs she has to take. I know there is a better way...HOW DO I DO IT?
20090203013712AAq3le9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE HELP! Am we being too close?	He has a girlfriend that he's been with for like a year. But she lives in another city which is 2 hours away from our city. And they used to see each other every weekend but it gets less and less but they text 24/7 (not kidding, literally!). We're pretty close, like we meet everyday and hang out before school and become late for school cause we like talking 1-on-1, when we're at school, we stay in the classroom so that we can be alone together. And I talk to him about Boys,Clothes and everything girls talk about (except periods, excluding that ONE TIME) I don't have any friends that are girls cause they're always plastic to me.    And we even hug a lot, and I live in a Penthouse by myself (my dad gave it to me cause it's closer to school) and we hang out there and we just lie down on my couch and talk about stuff. And he tells me how pretty I am, and how my eyes sparkle all the time, how cute my voice is. And he texts me some "I miss you" and :* (a kiss face) texts but, I don't say "I miss you" back cause I feel bad even though it's true.. cause he has a girlfriend, and I ask him about the kiss face, and he says "Just on the cheek"     I don't know, he says he's like that with all his friends that are girls...and if he is, am I the only girl that feels weird about it? I'm 15 and he's 16. Both his best guy buds are players (like 3 girlfriends at a time kind) maybe there's something? I tried to tell him to back off a bit before, but he just got sad about it (I swear he's like a girl sometimes) and it made us both feel bad, and made me feel worse!    Oh and his girlfriend visited him at school last week. But I didn't go to school cause I was busy, and I wanted them to have a nice day, just the two of them. But their day was ruined by his classmate and her friend who kept following them around, and bugging them. Then I told him, "At least you were together right?" and he said "I was still a little sad cause we didn't get to hang out..."    His GF is jealous of all the girls he's friends with. But he still hangs out with them even though his GF gets upset.

20090203002337AAWfYkV	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	PART II  DID I LET THEM OFF THE HOOK?  I RAN INTO THE THE GUY THAT MY EX-WIFE HAD COMMITTED ADULTERY WITH....?	Your Open QuestionShow me another ?    You see the guy that your wife (ex-wife) committed adultery with, which caused the divorce, what do you do?   If you had ran into the guy that your now ex-wife had committed adultery with at a local health club, what would you do? Would you say something to him, start a fight with him, or just ignore him? Very curious at all responses..........      Well, I did walk up to him and speak with him for about 10 -15 minutes.  I asked him if he knew who I was, he said yes.  Then, I ask  him if he knew that my wife was married when he was having sex with her, he said "No, she told me that she was legally divorced from you."  I told him that we wasn't but I figured that she would not be honest with him because she wasn't honest with me prior to me marrying her.  We talked some more and he acknowledged that they were going to get married.  I ended our conversation by telling him to take care of her and make her happy, because we had a rocky marriage.  He then said that was very noble of me.  Then she came up and ask if he was ready to go.  Did I let him off the hook?         Your call, please let me know      thanx

I was ok with that, but there were things she wouldn't tell me and her new friends started laughing at me  because of that (they said things like ''What kind of friend is that who keeps secrets from you?'') They were right, so me and another girl (I'll call her A) went and did some horrible things to her (like painted her door, washed her car with mud and things like that) I called that my revenge, but I know I overdid it a bit...Than S called our parents and told them everything....since then I haven't spoken to her.       It's been nearly half an year and I don't know what to do.I want to be again friend with S, but she won't listen to my apologies (talked to her on the internet ~yahoo messenger~) and I don't really know if A is a true friend or she just wanted to make me and S not to talk to each other...      I feel really confused...and lonely...What do you advise me to do ?     *I'm not a very sociable person, so finding new friends would be impossible for me*     ..please answer (you're my only hope)    [10 points for best answer!!!]

20090203011845AAfZFxR	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Does he still want to be with me or even love me?	I am engaged and have been with him for a year and some odd months. We jus moved in together in dec, and ever since its seemed like i'm jus a room mate that he jus happens to sleep in  the same bed with. I don't get "i love yous", "thank yous", hugs, kisses, talked to or even looked at unless he wants food, or something done, moved, picked up, or cleaned for him or sex. I love and care for him dearly, and would do anything for him - all i ask for in return is respect, love, and acknowledgment and i don't even get that. What does it mean?? Do you think he still loves me or cares'??? What do i do? please please help me i will answer any questions. oh p.s i tried asking and telling him we need counseling, but according to him there is "nothing" wrong. so please any input/ ideas would be great.
20090203011901AA2CtuU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My married lover says he loves me and my mums behind me. What does this mean?	What would this mean. I'm 24 and with my married boss...dont try and make me feel guilty, I dont.  If the wife gave him enough, he wouldnt need to stray and he says he loves me that this is the first time hes cheated. My mums behind me, she had affairs herself and agrees that if the husband was happy he wouldnt stray.  She even lets us use her house and she makes herself scarce for an hour or two.  However, he has started to buy really expensive gifts for me...after we have been together, maybe once per week, he leaves them on the bedside locker. Why?

20090203012048AAubN2C	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get over this girl?	She has been in almost all my classes in uni and I have had a thing for her for over a year.      Barely talked to her but I can't get her out of my head.      Every time I walk into a room that she is in I somehow spot her, even if I wasn't looking.      She is sooo pretty but has a bf. Also a lot of people consider her weird because she is really into Bahai.      It is getting quite frustrating because I really like her and I don't want to. I found out what classes she is doing this semester and it is tempting to change to them. I check her facebook profile every week or so.      I really want to forget about her, but I don't really find any other girls attractive now that I have built up this thing about her.

Im an18 year old guy and have been best mates wit this girl for a couple of years, she is 17, we are in school together. My dad keeped asking me if I was gay because I have never had a girlfriend. I really like this girl and she is stunning. She was going out with a guy until 6 months ago, i hated him. The other day we were hanging out over the park and I knew i wanted to ask her out - I prepared a speech about how much i liked her and in the end asked her would she be my girlfriend - she said yes! I was chuffed and we kissed and cuddled for about an hour, we had to go home then so i walked her. She was quiet, so i asked was she alrite and she said she was surprised. I was too and happy, she has met my parents before but not much so i asked her to come to tea on thurs night and she said yes. My dad said its about time he had lots of girlfriends by my age. Then yesterday we met up and I kissed her straight away for a few minutes and she got upset, I asked why and she said she wants us to stop kissing and being 'touchy' for a few weeks so she can see if she misses it. I said ok but im gutted and confused - i really want to kiss her- is that normal? we only kissed a few times. She said she still will come to tea, but wont stay long after. I dont know what ive done wrong? I am not ugly but a bit fat-- is that it?
20090203014750AAKcCtr	Family & Relationships;Friends	I seriously dislike my new school, that I even cried myself to sleep?	I know you think that I'm immature and blah blah... but truly I don't know anyone and the school I attended before felt like I was at home because it was close to my home and I knew everyone and I could just talk to just about anyone because we are all familiar to each other.       But at my new school its a completely different world and I cannot relate to anyone at all, and I don't think I will ever, I just don't seem to fit in. They wouldn't do the things I would want to do, and I don't want to change myself to be like them... I want to keep my joyful self. I'm the kind of person who always smiles and laughs about nothing but at my new school I don't even smile at all not even once... it just brings me to tears.      I'm going insane because I'm not used to it and I don't think I will ever. Because what I experienced at my old school and the friends we all shared was like no other and I miss it so much! ;'( Please help me... what do I do?

20090203015147AAEgJIC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is he so annoyed? Is it pride?	I work with this man, we used to be good friends but feelings developed and our friendship got awkward. Basically, I thought he was more into another woman and he did seem caught between us, so I wouldn't entertain him, despite the fact he claimed they were just friends. However, he was uncomfortable if the three of us were at a social do together, so.....Anyway, it seemed to me that when I tried to be friends with him again, he was cold. He came around then and we were getting on great, but just then, he turned cold again. So I have kept my distance, I have been polite etc, but don't go out of my way to engage him in chat etc. Thing is, THIS is pissing him off. The fact that I don't make an effort to be friends seems to be making things worse, in the sense that he now barely says hello back to me even on the odd occasions that we bump into each other during the day. I dunno, is he trying to make us more distant by doing this, or is he annoyed that I won't make an effort so is paying me back? Also, if I look well, he avoids me like the plague, makes a point of looking away or pretending that he can't see me (so I'll see him doing it, even other people have noticed this and this is a guy whose entire interaction with women is based on flirtation and compliments) BUT if I look casual, he will bouyantly say hello and it is like old times. What gives?

20090203020634AApGieO	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is my brothers break up affecting me so badly?	Im 25, my brothers 27. He was due to marry his Fiance in May in Spain. She's very very odd, sometimes a source of amusement, but mostly frustrating when you've to deal with her. Shes not evil, but shes VERY rude and I think shes very insecure because she doesnt let my brother go out, so the past 5 years they dont have friends. This is his fault as well but he's very submissive. She made my bro put tons of locks on the door (even though theres not much crime in their area), and just everything she comes out with is nuts (in a bad way). Anyway, I keep my opinions to myself because I just want my bro to be happy and if thats with her thats fine, im not the one whose marrying her, but I do worry for their prospective children. Yesterday morning, out of no where, he broke up with her and moved home. She came up to my house last night crying her eyes out. The fact that she came to me when she knows me and her only have a mediocre relationship is bad because she really has NO ONE. I had to try and be as on the line because although Im looking at for my bro, heres this vulnerable devasted girl on my doorstep. She left after an exhausting few hours of me consoling her and telling her she needs to join some after work clubs to meet people (gym, salsa, art etc) but I then spent the whole night crying because i felt so bad for them. Now I feel like a wreck today, why is that??

He is real sweet to me in person though and was very helpfull with helping me get over depressoin and anorexia. Am I crazy fo liking him?

I got out of a serious realationship with a gf of mine that listed 3 years. I loved her I really did. She broke up with me and left me stranded. I have become the person I thought I would never become. I don't date for relationship intentions  anymore I simply go out with women with the sole intent of getting in their pants. I have become the animal in which I hate but I cant help that. I get no joy or feelings when I meet a new girl. I go out to go out and have fun with these girls. What is wrong with me? I sleep with girls just to sleep with them and have no shame in it anymore. I no longer believe in love or anything close to it. I used to do everything for them but now I do it just for me and me alone. Can you blame me? I left out the details as to why she left because it doesn't matter. Lets just say it was not my fault.

20060625195338AAjra5e	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do you ever think about breaking up with your boyfriend and then change your mind?	I've been with my boyfriend for 5 years, and 90% of the time everything is fine.  He's funny, witty, sweet he tries really hard to make me happy when he knows I'm mad at him....but only when he's in a good mood.  What bothers me about him is that he can be uptight sometimes.  Only around loud, wild kids and my friends or family who are full of drama. Meaning they drink a lot, are loud, have a lot going on in their personal lives...kind of ghetto. He has this frown on his face that really eats me up, it makes me want to leave him.  I feel like he needs to accept my family at the very least, at least by not frowning!! especially if he always drags me around to all his friends gatherings that I don't always want to go to. The thing is he is so down to earth ussually....This is just an example of things that happen.  My issue is that whenever I get mad about ANYTHING, even at his crazy temper when he drives, I think about leaving him.

20060628000220AAJZRjr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I stupid to believe that this is true love? I could use as much advices as you can give to me.?	I am having a hard time in this long distance relationship. The women I had known for one and a half years had been cheating on me from what she told me about 3-4 times since we meet. Now she tells me she thinks she is going to have a child. When I tried to brakeup with her she started crying so hard and wanting me to forgive her. I told her I could feel she was not being faithful, but still I stayed even knew in my heart that someday she might have a kid that is not mine. I am the only one who she tells everything to including how many times she made love. Not even her own family knows. I had told her that I might accept the child and giving her a chance to regain my trust. She is willing to do what I say and even said she will wait 3 years if she had to for me to come around. It made her feel a bit better that I said I still love her. I must be stupid or really love her to give her so many chances. What you think? Am I hopeless? Any faithful women looking for a nice God fearing guy?

20060722171839AAl2zs2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Women trouble?	I really like this girl I met a week ago, and we have gone out a few times.  First I went to the park with her so we could talk and we did for like 4 hours.  Next she invited me over to her house and we watched a movie.  The most resent date was to a movie.  At the movies I did not make a move because I am really shy, nice and have a hard time seeing if she really likes me as more than a friend or just as friends and I do not want to make a move if she just wants to be friends.  We have a lot of things in common.  Now I have been trying to go out with her again but she keeps making plains with her other girl friends after she said we were going out.  Is this a sign that she just wants to be friends or is this nothing to be worried about?  Could not making a move on our last “date” make her think I am not in to her?  What should I do?

20060723210916AAVl0Wq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I feel GUILTY about THIS?	So I dated this guy for a week when he told me he loved me. Oops, I said it back because I didn't know what else to say...I'm new to this.       After a month of being together I thought things were going great and that possibly, he could be the one. He expressed this quite a bit. Add another month to that, and I realized I'm just not attracted to him like that anymore.      Now he HATES me for breaking up with him, altered his phone so he couldn't receive any communication from me whatsoever, and has told me that we can't be friends. I know he really liked me, but he makes me feel like a murderer.    Almost like I should get back together with him because I feel sorry for him. Should I be feeling guilty like this?? I didn't break his heart on purpose.

20060831195657AA6U4M2	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to tell them nicely I am not interested?	About a year ago a 'married with 2 kids' couple moved across the street from us.  2 days ago the wife stopped by for a visit.  We have spoken occasionally and I think they are a fairly nice, normal family.  As we visited the other day, she kept mentioning that they were thinking about 'spicing up' their sex life and had considered including more people in their 'relationship'.  I assumed that it was just curiosity since she is 10 years my junior and maybe thought we had more experience with such matters. (the spice, not the extra people)  There were many lllloooonnnngggg stares coming my way during this and I really was at a loss on how to handle it.(haha no pun intended)  I don't want to be ugly to her/them in any way as we have kids who play together and would hate for the kids to be adversely affected.  I am just really not into this but I feel like she's not getting the hint.  Other than that she's a real nice person and fun to hang with.

20060705095454AAZnSvV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you consider marrying someone with bipolar affective disorder?	I am 36 years old and have been treated for bipolar affective disorder for 17 years. In the last 5 years, it has been under very good control and I have earned a Master's degree, gotten a good job in my profession, and bought a house. I also have a lot of supportive friends and have pretty good relationships with most of my relatives.      I have been dating a wonderful and responsible man who began talking about our future together as a married couple. When I revealed that I have bipolar affective disorder and shared the details of my troubled past with him, our relationship slowed down a lot. Lately he tells me that he cares about me and wants to continue our relationship but is not sure about marriage. We have been dating for 10 months and I want to marry him and start a family. How long should I wait for him?

20060718150315AAqgXQQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I grant my wife this wish?	My wife has confided that she wants a black stripper for her birthday. I thouht she was joking at first. She said that if I did get her one, she would allow me one wish also, like my fantasy about her dressing up like a maid. Or even allowing me to get a lapdance from a female stripper (one time). She said that she has no intentions about being unfaithful. She has been faithful and would just like one fantasy and would not ask for more. She says that she would not do anything sexual with the stripper, but would touch him if I would let her. If not, she would just look. Should I allow her? She IS a faithful wife and is extremely open with me. She says that she is 30 this year and would like to do one crazy thing since we married so young. She says seeing a muscular black guy strip for her is the only thing she wants. Should I allow her one crazy thing like this? Should i be bothered by the racial aspect or is it a common fantasy?

20060719084434AAAZvNS	Family & Relationships;Family	Being Taken For Advantage?	My sister who has Always Depended on me since our mothers' death (when we were just kids) has been making me feel guilty and sorry for her. I moved to far from HOME to get away from her and drama. But she followed me. Now I'm trying to get a job and can't because I'm STUCK with her kids and mine. And she won't get child care because she don't have her youngests Birth Certificate. So she uses me for a ride to work and a person to watch her kids (whom don't mind me because she tells them not too). Also I only get paid 100 a month from her and she tells me that's all she can afford, they are staying in a motel that they pay 700dollars for a month. But she makes atleast 700 a month and her bf makes atleast 1600 a week. (Only one of the kids are his and hers) the other three are my sisters and her exe husbands. What do you think I should say and do? I don't want to be too harsh on her...

20060731210347AAXn2rk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you believe that a high-school romance can last forever?	I'm going out with this guy, and I love him...and I know it has the potential to last forever. However, everyone around us...thinks it's impossible...or that for whatever reason it's good to meet tons and tons of guys before you commit yourself. But I feel that's why people never stay together, they're so busy meeting tons of guys...looking for the right guy...so they miss or overlook the guy that they have potential to make it with. I however believe, love doesn't just happen...lust just happens, love is a decision and something that develops by your choices. I believe what I have with him his right...I can't describe how I know it's right...I just do. But other people think it won't last forever, or that I don't really know anything because I'm in highschool. But I feel this in my heart, and I really can't describe how I know. What do you think based on this. I just want to see...if other people feel the way I do...so maybe that way I know there is hope. For everyone, not just me.

All we want is for the boys to come home?	me and my soon to be husband are having problms with his ex. she took his kids and won't let him see them because of me do you think i should just leave and not be in the picture. i mean his kids are more important and i would not want me to be the cause of him seeing them. she has done everything from CPS reports saying i hit the kids. also not answering her phone when he tries to call and says he wants to see them. and when they do come over they are not allowed to stay th night and if he does not ring them o her houre at the time she says then she is calling the cops on him. i mean everything was fine cuz their home is with him and i live at the same house too. but one day she took the like she does for a day but this time she won't bring them back and they want to come home but she tells them no. also they need much attention because they are all hearing impaired (deaf). but she leaves them alone when she goes to work. she said she know how to work the system cuz she works for CPS.

20060805102646AA9iVJ8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't think some of you guys and gals understand...?	I was the guy who asked this question.      Ladies, my woman doesn't turn me on. She doesn't try to be sexy. I do love her. But she acts so scared or shy. I tell her what I like and she just acts shy. And for a man you don't have to be the perfect porn star, but I want her to try to act like the porn star maybe once or twice or three time a week, (maybe four times) I am getting off track, I'm back. But for men it is more just seeing it, then the feeling it. And I don't want to cheat, but I am not be full filled by her sex.       Now we have been together for a while.  And I do talk all the time with my woman.  She like when I do that freaky stuff to her.  But when I what a little freak action she shy or all smiles, but the killing part is she can do it and do it good.  but she said I was her first (hmm) and she is 26 years old.  I think wolf had the best answer.

20060812110205AA5ow5a	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When is the right time you should tell someone "I Love You"?	Think carefully about this. Some of you will say "theres is no right time, when you fill it you will know and then you should say it while you can". So lets say that moment is in a week of meeting the person or maybe 5 months or lets give it a whole year. You just said: "say it when you feel it" so if your thinking that a week is to soon than obviously that contadicts your first answer, right?. I hate that we let time determain what we should do and when we should do it.Yes there is a lot of confusion so please be as clear as possible with your answer thanks.

I have only a few "friends" - tons of aquaintences - but no one i can call my best friend, someone i can tell anything to. i've never had close friends. growing up every girl i was ever friends with had stabbed me in the back at least once. I guess I was easy to hurt and they took advantage of that. Anyway now i am 19 years old and I don't trust people easily at all. Going out with friends doesn't even sound appealing to me. The usual 19 yr old girl can be found drinking her life away, instead I don't, i hang out with my dog or do stuff by myself. i'm very independent, and i sometimes feel like such a loser because I don't do the normal things people my age do.  LIKe right now i feel like friends are avoiding me, since they didnt' call when they said they would. i just don't get it! what is wrong with me??

It has been about four months, and he has met some of my friends and family but I have YET to meet any of his friends, family, co workers etc... You get my drift.  When I bring it up he says that there has never been a time to introduce me, BUT he goes out with his friends all the time w/ out me. I don't mind him hanging with his friends but it is always at a time when I have something else going on.  He always comes to my house and  I've been to his once and it was at night and his roommate was out.   All of his ex girlfriends have been white or hispanic.   I'm beginning to think I am some type of fetish or fantasy that he is fullfilling.  He mentions that he has had a black girlfriend before about a million years ago in high school.  I don't feel that counts for anything. He is a really nice guy but this is bothering me. I don't know how to bring this up in a serious conversation without  him getting defensive

20060820132929AA5ZCyb	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My Ex wants to get back together but he is in love with another girl too. He doesn't know which one to pick!	My ex-boyfriend still has feelings for me and also has feelings for another girl (who considers him as her boyfriend). He always tells me that he is not comitted to her but he has feelings towards her! And he keeps on giving me hints to get back together, or sometimes he is straight forward with me and just says it! I don't know what to do! i asked him to pick, but he says that it is too hard.. He doesnt want to regret anything and he doesn't want to hurt anyones feelings! But i am stuck in the middle and confused as hell, wondering what to do.. I do have feelings for him but sometimes i just hate him for what he's putting me through! The other day i told him that we will never get back together, but he just answered "don't promise yourself that, cuz we might" What the hell is that supposed to mean?!?! And at the same time, i think he treats the other girl the same way.. Please help me and tell me what to do!

There is no question theree. But I know in my heart of hearts that he's not who I wont to spend the rest of my life together with. So do I go for my dreams r not? HELP!

I find that he is the opposite of me, which complements my weakness.   However, I'm not certain about his feelings towards me. My friend ask my opinion about him but I said that I prefer to remain single. He is looking for someone whom he can settle down with, but I'm not keen in marriage at this point of time.   My previous relationships failed me and had phobia to start a new one.   But, if he's a good catch, isn't it a waste to loose him?

He told me that he couldnt trust himself enough to not do anything with her. She is his ex he admitted to me many times that he still had feelings for her. If he said that he cared about me as much as he said he did, wouldnt he not even have to think about this. The chick came up here (north florida) just to see him.

I have always wanted a male HOH and just didn't know how to put it in words.  After reading about Taken in Hand and D/D on the internet, I have found what I have always wanted deep down inside put into words for me.   The spankings have been incredible.  In just a week, I have been made to quit smoking and manage my health better.  The only poblem we have is I am the primary bread winner, he has returned to school to finish his degree.  I do not believe this should matter.  I told him I make money for us not me.  He is uncomfortable decideing how money is spent, since he sees it as my money.  I have no problem and truly want him to be the HOH I know he can be.  Before this I really was the HOH, but I don't want to be anymore.  I want to take my proper place in our relationship.  He wants to keep thinggs equal.  I said they could still be, just he has the final say.  Any advice from people practicing this lifestyle would be greatly appreciated.

20060830120020AA9y60u	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My Ex wants to be friends, but i want her back,!?	Hey,   basically, started to see this girl about two months ago, first month in was cool. Then after a while she admitted that sabotage relationships before and had had counselling for it. So basically we spoke about it and after we did things seemed to go back to good. Then after a while i used to go round there and she would be like totally not interested, didn't really want to talk to me, she would put our time on schedule, never come out when i invited her out, nadda.   Then she sends me an email saying we need to talk, we did and she said bascailly she can't give me what i want ( a replatioship ) at the moment, and she said you never know what's going to happen in the future, she was like, you never know, we could end up getting married etc, and she also said that she can;t rule out any other blokes in the future!!   Since then she has gone into friends mode and she contacts me every day, whether it be an email order text, or ringing me. Really want her back, any suggestions

20060906173155AAVnQUl	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do you think I should leave her or give her a chance?	Hi I'm 24 and my gf is 21,   Me and my gf have been together for 2 years now, but I'm not sure about our relationship.   We live in different cities and we usually see each other about once a month, for about a week usually, and during holidays (summer,xmas,etc.) .   I found out a couple of times she lied to me. She told me she was at work and instead she was taking a walk with her friends [as she told me after I found out the truth], recently I found out she had another mobile number she used to keep in touch with her ex, "just to see if he still pursues her" but she never answered his messages/phone calls, this is what she told me. She said she did  this because she has low self esteem.    [her father left her family and never ever tried to talk with her, he even exploited the fact she was searching for him to claim by his lawyer that her mother told her to talk to him in order to take his money..]   Do you think I should give her another chance?

One of my best friends likes him too but didn't say anything to me..(I thought it would be true from her actions and she told the others that she used to like him but..)..I feel bad..I told her I like him and she looked ok with that..But when we go out all together it seems to me that she is trying to take him for herself..She always trys to be the centre of interest and trys with any way to find out about his private life..if anyone saw her it would be obvious that she wants him..  On the other hand he doesn't seem interested on her at all..(I think he seems more on me) I talk with him and he asked me out a few times(with his friends&mine if I wanted)but he doesn't talk with my friend from phone or sms..  His friend said that he has a crush but I don't know if it's really true and who the girl is..  What should I do?
20060918071635AAi1JNv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does anyone know Nathan Vigenser? He lives in South Carolina ( I think). Please help?	It's been years since I've talked with him.  I miss him and think about him every day.  He is my lost love & the only one who truly knew me. I moved away from him because my mother was terminally ill. I've lost contact with him.  If you know him tell him that his princess is looking for him.
20060919110853AAOqU6W	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Did U ever think the reason guys don't wanna lick p.u.s.s.y is cause thet don't wanna risk catching a STD	PS. Thats why so many guys only want BJ's from girls. They figure BJ's are extremely low risk or no risk of catching a STD. Yes some guys are just lazy, but for the most part, most guys want BJ's only because they wanna fell secure on not catching a STD. I strongly agree. Do you agree?

Guys have told I'm that I'm sexy and when they find out that I'm a virgin they don't believe me at first. I don't dress skanky but maybe its cuz I have long hair, big eyes and lips, and curves? Being sexy doesn't mean a person is sexual cuz I haven't even gone past kissing. I think I may be attracting the wrong guys, guys how do you judge a girl by her looks?

20061002204538AAaq6T7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How does a great guy meet/date women when there are so many tough obstacles on the UK dating scene?	women say im very confident and often ask me if im single. I am and im not interested in being a player. but it doesnt matter how confident or genuine i am, either her friend will do stuff to pull the girl away even though she has already admitted shes into me, or my freinds says so many useless things or acts odd - he bores her friend and so the friend pulls the other girl away! The uk dating scene is very hard and even though i meet women during the day and in pubs/clubs its so hardcore id have to give up my day job to be successful. Ive got my own life and i dont need a woman, but iwant a quality one... i realsie i may have to date a few before i find someone right for me. Im an attractive guy with a great life and a good job, but it seems almost impossible to make a connection in pubs/clubs over here. and if youve just met someone, the girl is often going to have to pick her friends over you, cause she just met you and has known them for ages.any ideas on how to be more successful?

Well they both live in the same town and I recently moved to a city 300 miles away. I hardly ever get to see either of them now. It has been a little weird that they are talking now, but now it's weirder because they are partying together too. I guess it is natural since they know each other through me and we all went to college together...but it still makes me weird. Like last night they had a big heart to heart and they were both like, "Wow hanging out really helped me out" It makes me sad and jealous that they get to spend time together meanwhile I am stuck in grad school 7 hours away. What do you guys think? What should I do?

Okay, I figure I should tell you a little about my situation before I throw this question at you. Read this!!    Okay, this guy's name is Kaleb. I've known him since the 6th grade, and we are in 7th now. He has short brownish - blonde hair, and he is just one of those people who squeezes in a joke whenever he can. The thing is, we were at a party at our school, and his girls as friends said he asked me out. I hesitated but said yes because I have liked him since we first met. Then later at the party, his friend Kevin, told me to wait in this one spot and he dragged Kaleb over to me, and said, "Kaleb, tell her." Then Kaleb said, "Okay, I admit it, me and Kevin are going out, he just can't resist me." I just smiled and sort of just sat there while Kevin was trying to make Kaleb say something, but our parents came to pick us up from the party before he could say anything.

Then, as if he was pissed that I'd ruined his excuse, he said, Well, maybe I'll see you and maybe I won't.  What's up with that?  Then I couldn't ask another date, and I was already stuck making all the food.  In the end, he didn't come.  Then I didn't hear from him for two weeks and he said, "oh, sorry about the other night.  A machine broke at work and I had to do everything manually."  still, he has my number and could have called.  I think, Does he hate me? but then he comes over and flirts with me!!!! Arg!

We lasted 5 years together and we broke up because I wanted to see the world, I wanted to become a professional and find sucess. All this time he was there.. waiting , after alot of thinking and another failed relationship .. I realized that the one that I LOVE was the one I neglected . I waited to tell him about my feelings because I realize that If he was there for so many years , he was going to still be waiting for me. After a quick phone call he told me he was becoming a father and that he waited for me for too long , so long that he didnt love me anymore......      He even told me not to call him again . I am crushed , yes I found sucess , yes I saw the world , but at what cost....      What Should I do? I dont want him to be ., that kind of love that you tell your grandchildren about , that one and only..

I have the courage to just go up to her and ask her if she wants to go somewhere sometime, but i don't know if I should. Or should I tell her that I kind of like her, and if she ever becomes avalable to let me know, or should I ask her if she doesnt see things working out with that guy to let me know, because I will wait for her for 6 months?

20061126085924AA8Cuxn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies!  2 questions, right quick.....?	1.  Why is it that you really beautiful women want what you can not have?  Once you get it, you don't want it anymore and you go looking for something else.   2.  At what age do you realize that for the rest of your life, do you want to go through the periods of loneliness, or do you want to find someone that loves you unconditionally from your fingers to your toes, a man that wakes in the morning only because he can look you in the eyes and see forever.  At what age do you realize that being in love, truely in love, is a better feeling than a one night stand or any amount of money in your pocket?

20061128185626AAz6Wys	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Beautiful woman, please help me.?	this girl and i had a conversation where we established we'd just be friends bc we are both in complicated situations with other people. at the end of it, she had tears in her eyes. a few days later, she sent me poetry. she said it wasn't directly about me but i think the words dictate they were: for instance, i told her that we had a connection, which to me was almost surreal. her poetry said "Reality is too two-dimensional to become the inhibited form of our Mere disguise or desire." and other words in the poem referred to the talk we had. she is REALLY shy in real life and i always feel like she is holding something back but i can't tell if it's that she likes me or not. i know she likes to communiciate through writing. i am too shy to ask her about the meaning of these words as i feel we've established that we are just friends, even though i want her badly. what should i do??

20061203032931AAVsh55	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My now ex-boyfriend lied to me and used me.  Am I stupid, because he is happy and I am the one sad & crying.?	We were to get married in 4 months, he has been lying to me about where he is.  He works out of country and told me he was taking his R&R in Germany, then in March, he was coming home and we were getting married.  I found out he has been lying, he is partying up with 2 other woman in Australia.  This guy is a big, balding, hairy- backed man.  He has a 3'' penis and seemed inexperienced in bed.  He would squash me in bed to where I could hardly breath. I looked passed this and loved him with all my heart, faithfully. I gave up a good sex life to be with someone I loved and he treats me like this.  I have been crying for 4 days now.  I texted him and for 4 days now, he only texted once saying I am in England.  Which I found out positively he was lying.  How can someone be so cold-hearted.  I am a beautiful girl and now have people asking what I saw in the ugly man.  I never thought of him as unattractive.  Everyone is say he was a dog. But why is he happy and I am so sad?

20061212140337AABpdLA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can anyone help me understand why a boyfriend would turn his girlfriend down?	This is embarrassing but I can't stop thinking about it and it is really bothering me. Please no mean answers I just need some advice. Yesterday I asked my boyfriend to be intimate with me and he turned me down. He said he didn't want our relationship to be "just about sex." We really don't even do it that often.  Should I read more into this? I felt very hurt and rejected. Maybe I am not attractive enough for him? Maybe I was too forward? Guys if you could answer this I'd appreciate it, and girls I'd like to hear what you think too. How would you feel if your boyfriend turned you down for it and how would you deal with it? I feel kind of awkward and uncomfortable around him now. If the reason he gave is the real reason, that's not so bad. I think I am just worried it's something more. This has never happened to me before. Any advice? Thank you for your help :-)
