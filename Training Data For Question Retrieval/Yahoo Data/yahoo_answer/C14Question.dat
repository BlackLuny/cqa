20090205160428AATvemX	Politics & Government;Politics	I thought Obama was reaching across the aisle?	Why did he pick this loon for office then?      President Obama has appointed his old friend and colleague, University of Chicago Professor Cass Sunstein, to run the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.  Sunstein is a rabid enemy of Americans’ Second Amendment freedom, and harbors radical ideas about animal rights that only the most ardent PeTA activist would love.  Now he will run the federal office that oversees all government regulations.       In his bestselling book, The Audacity of Deceit: Barack Obama’s War on American Values, Brad O’Leary warns about Obama’s close ties with many questionable characters whose views are extreme – and how these Obama friends will soon be occupying the halls of power in Washington. President Obama is proving O’Leary right.       Chapter 12 in Audacity provides a complete dossier on Cass Sunstein and all of Obama’s radical leftist friends and colleagues – some of whom may join Obama’s administration.       Just how radical is Sunstein?          In a 2004 book, Sunstein wrote: “[A]nimals should be permitted to bring suit, with human beings as their representatives, to prevent violations of current law … Any animals that are entitled to bring suit would be represented by (human) counsel, who would owe guardian like obligations and make decisions, subject to those obligations, on their clients’ behalf.”    In a 2007 speech at Harvard University, Sunstein argued that “we ought to ban hunting” and even called for “eliminating current practices such as…meat eating.”    “Sunstein is just the tip of the iceberg,” says O’Leary.  “President Obama likes to gloss over his more questionable relationships as ‘coincidences.’ Don’t be surprised when these ‘coincidences’ find their way to power in Washington.”    To that end, O’Leary’s Audacity of Deceit provides a clear, and unsettling, vision of what the next four years under President Obama will bring.

20080926082100AAoIlS8	Politics & Government;Elections	Does this prove how sexist John McCain is?	John McCain picked Sarah Palin because he felt she was a strong woman who got things done . So why isn't he letting her continue the campaign she's not a senator so she doesn't need to be in Washington. Isn't the VP supposed to be the backup of the President. Not just that, you can't talk to her, you can't see her, what's up with that. He's treating her like a Trophy Wife something just for show. Is this not being sexist toward his own running mate. He say's he's for putting a woman in the Vice Presidential office but then he treats her like this.      Your Opinion!

She didn't know about the bailout plan until she overheard a couple of us talking about it yesterday, she is naive on many elements of the world, she doesn't even know what nair  is ( not relevant but had to add). I'm also pretty sure once she graduates she's going to just live off her boyfriend, and she tends to talk smack about people who are living on her own but not living with there parents because they don't always have a lot of money. The clincher was when she was excited that her ex-boyfriends, girlfriend had a miscarriage. She seemed to think it was funny. Yet, she can also get her vagina pierced, just to prove a point to co-workers. Then got her nose pierced after that for fun.      She comes from a small town and I'm not saying everyone from a small town is like this, but I wonder if this is the small town values everyone is bragging about?

What if Bush, McCain and Obama were all on the same plane and it crashed on a Snow capped mountain much like in the movie Alive!   Bush, McCain and Obama are the only survivors of the crash, and they're advisers and security personnel all died. So they're stuck there with no rescue in sight for weeks and maybe months.

20081014131814AAx3TRo	Politics & Government;Elections	What do you think of this economic/tax policy?	BAR STOOL ECONOMICS or Taxes 101    Suppose that every day, ten men go out for beer and the bill for all ten  comes to $100.    If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something  like this:      The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.  The fifth would pay $1.  The sixth would pay $3.  The seventh would pay $7.  The eighth would pay $12.  The ninth would pay $18.  The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59.   total equals $100.00    So, that's what they decided to do. The ten men drank in the bar every day  and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner threw  them a curve.    'Since you are all such good customers, he said, I'm going to reduce the  cost of your daily beer by $20.     Drinks for the ten now cost just $80.    The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes so the  first four men were unaffected. They would still drink for free. But what  about the other six men - the paying customers? How could they divide the  $20 windfall so that everyone would get his 'fair share?'     They realized that $20 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that  from everybody's share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end  up being paid to drink his beer. So, the bar owner suggested that it would  be fair to reduce each man's bill by roughly the same amount, and he  proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay.!    And so:    The fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% savings).  The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33%savings).  The seventh now pay $5 instead of $7 (28%savings).  The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25% savings).  The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% savings).  The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% savings).    Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to drink for free. But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings.    'I only got a dollar out of the $20, 'declared the sixth man. He pointed to  the tenth man, 'but he got $10!'    'Yeah, that's right,' exclaimed the fifth man. 'I only saved a dollar, too.  It's unfair that he got ten times more than I!'    'That's true!!' shouted the seventh man. 'Why should he get $10 back when I  got only two? The wealthy get all the breaks!'*    'Wait a minute,' yelled the first four men in unison. 'We didn't get  anything at all. The system exploits the poor!'    The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.    The next night the tenth man didn't show up for drinks, so the nine sat  down and had beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill,  they discovered something important. They didn't have enough money between  all of them for even half of the bill!    And that, boys and girls, journalists and college professors, is how our  tax system works. The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit  from a tax reduction. Tax them too much , attack them for being wealthy, and  they just may not show up anymore. In fact, they might start drinking  overseas where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.    David R. Kamerschen, Ph.D.  Professor of Economics, University of Georgia

20081019134847AA6ZFPK	Politics & Government;Elections	Do Americans realize that we are already a socialist economy?	I keep hearing everyone talking about Obama is going to turn us into a socialist nation. We are already socialist! Capitalism requires a degree of socialism to survive. We already have farm subsidies, oil subsidies, public education, social security, community and state colleges (yes the taxpayers subsidize those too), student loans, pell grants, grants for non profits... these are just a few examples of socialism in this country but there are A LOT more examples. Socialism and capitalism go hand in hand. Without a certain degree of it, our economy would totally collapse. Now, I am nowhere near rich, my only household makes about 65,000 on one income ( I am a SAHM and a student). But when I finish school and become better off I won't mind paying my fair share to support the infrastructure.   How can we fight a multi-trillion dollar war without raising taxes? What do the Republicans want to do? Keep borrowing money from China?       Well we have already been redistributing wealth, we have just been redistributing it from the bottom to the top.      While speaking at at $4,000 a plate fundraiser this is what Warren Buffet, the richest man in America said,   “The 400 of us [here] pay a lower part of our income in taxes than our receptionists do, or our cleaning ladies, for that matter. If you’re in the luckiest 1 per cent of humanity, you owe it to the rest of humanity to think about the other 99 per cent.”       Just a thought; what are yours?

They paid around $200,000 for it. 5 years later they have tons on escrow in the home. Then unfortunate one of them falls ill. They have private insurance but because the insurance company insist it's a preexisting condition they won't cover the cost. One of the spouses need some expensive surgeries to survive. So, with nothing left they refinance their home loan and take out an extra $250,000 to pay for the cost. The spouse survives, and they are paying their bills as best as they can. But as home prices start to go down and cost of normal living expenses goes up they keep getting further and further behind. They end up losing their home.      Whose fault is it?

It is just like enforcing the prohibition of African American marriage.   Did they decide to be black? Or were they BORN that way.   Don't give me an answer about evolution, mankind, "that's what you beleive," or the way "things work."      How would you decide to be that way?   You just wanna try it for a change?   No, you're born that way.      To help you better understand that, if they enforced the prohibition of straight marriage would everyone turn gay? And suddenly act like a girl because they choose to act like a girl? To get a different girl-like voice just for the fun of it? Or were they born with the hormones that make them that way.      *I am not a homosexual, but I have absolutely no problem with it.

KARACHI: Karachi police have registered a case against three unidentified women who allegedly kidnapped a man and raped him over four consecutive days and then threw him near Qayyumabad River in an unconscious state. The case has been registered on a complaint by the victim, identified only as Khalil (23) – who recently arrived in Karachi from Rahimyar Khan and works as a waiter at a restaurant in Neelum Colony, Clifton. On the night of January 27, an identified man ordered Khalil to deliver food to women sitting in a car parked outside the restaurant where he works. “After giving me the order, the man went towards the car. I took the order to the car where the women – two of whom were young and the third was middle-aged – told me that they had recently shifted to the area,” said Khalil. He said the women asked him to deliver food to their house every day, and he agreed. “They asked me to go along with them in the car ... they said they wanted to show me where their house was.” Khalil said the women gave him a ‘glazed sweet’ and once they got to the house, “they gave me milk that had some drug mixed in it ... I fell unconscious after drinking it”. Khalil said when he gained consciousness, he found that the women had undressed him, “and they were forcing themselves onto me”. ASP Asad Raza said the women assaulted Khalil sexually for the next four days, and then threw him near Qayyumabad River. Khalil managed to stop a passing motorist – who took him to Civil Hospital. “His condition is really bad ... his genitals are bleeding and he cannot walk properly,” said Raza. Raza said the women belonged to rich families of Karachi’s Clifton area. “It’s a complicated case ... but we are hoping that we will solve it soon,” he added. faraz khan    http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp...

Pelosi's Tuna Surprise   January 16, 2007      Economists of every political stripe agree that a higher minimum wage will cost some low-skill workers their jobs. But don't believe us; just ask Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi.      The House last week whooped through an increase in the minimum wage to $7.25, by a vote of 315-116. But, lo, included as part of this boon to the working man was a loophole: The new, higher wage floor applied to all of these United States and its territories -- save for the Pacific outpost of American Samoa. In the immortal words of Congressman Patrick McHenry (R., N.C.), "There's something fishy going on here."      It turns out that American Samoa has a big fish and tuna canning industry, specifically operations run by StarKist and Chicken of the Sea. Both companies are headquartered in California, and StarKist's parent is located in none other than Ms. Pelosi's own San Francisco district. So faster than you can say "middle class squeeze," Democrats rediscovered the eternal economic truth that a higher minimum wage can cost jobs and granted Samoa its reprieve.       http://online.wsj.com/public/article_pri...

When the buildings began to collapse (The top did tilt btw) the mass of weight coming down quickly overwhelmed each floors.  As the weight came down the collapse speed would have picked up speed.  Secondly.  The wtc was built with a framed tube design which means that it was designed to resist lateral forces which means the entire thing would not have tipped over. It would have come straigt down.  Thirdly, the air in the elevator shafts and stairwells would have needed to be forced out somehow.  The mostlikely spot is the skylobbies, and that is exactly where we see it happening.  It happened on all sides of the buildings and both towers.  4th the north tower fell on WTC 7, and severely damaged it.

If the median price for a home in the United States is $250,000 (I'm not sure what it is, but I'm guessing that figure is somewhere in the ballpark), then you could buy FOUR MILLION HOUSES with a trillion dollars.  You could GIVE a house to families that are being foreclosed.  I'm not sure how many properties are being foreclosed at the moment, but I'm hoping its not much over 4 million.      I am not in favor of this.  I'm just tyring to put the figure of this "stimulus" in perspective.

20090205125823AAgTnYU	Politics & Government;Politics	Why does this Stimulus pkg. have to be rushed through?	There is so much at stake.  We made one big mistake believing like chicken little that the sky was falling and ended up with giving away billions in the TARP program so what is the big rush now.      We were promised a 'line by line' veto of pork but all the pork is thrown into the pen and we are not even supposed to take time to consider it.      Many years ago my mother told me 'marry in haste and repent at leisure'.  I think this is apropos in this Stimulation situation.     "Act in haste and the entire Country will repent at leisure".  This goes for the senators and president pushing to  jam this through quickly.   It is not fair to the U.S. citizens and if it fails, which I predict, all the Dems voting for it will be replaced with a Republican Congress.      Let's all take a deep breath, quit demanding our own way, scrap the Stimulus package and be transparant about ALL that is in this bill.   We should expect no less than an honest debate and transparency.        I've watched closely but I cannot see where it will bring the value of my home up to it's original value.  I cannot imagine seeing the 'foreclosure' signs coming down from lawns leaving empty houses and broken hearts.  I can not see the unemployment lines growing shorter, I cannot see a decrease in lines at the food banks, I cannot see more people receiving Medicaid.      All I can see is an ever increasing population resenting broken promises, the rich continuing to get richer, the more people under bridges.  God knows I don't want to see this but rushing through more Socialist programs is all I can see.      The latest debate I've been watching on C-Span, Senate, was arguing that any learning institution receiving federal funds or being repaired or updated with federal funds will lost their funding if any religion is allowed.      I don't care what someone's faith is but they should not be forbidden freedom of expression.  Can't they all respect, accept and tolerate each other?  Why do we need such laws?      We were once guaranteed 'freedom of speech' but it now seems only the fringe groups are allowed that freedom.      There is too much in this so called pork barrel to go on but it should not be rushed through.  It will benefit none of us in the long run.  If it does not work out the Democrats and President need to start sending out resumes.

20090205122449AAnGQ6K	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can we sue the hospital for negligence?	Last year in November my mother went into hospital for a week due to bad stomach pains - we later learned it could be pancreatitis.   Anyway, when she was in, she went on morphine and a drip, so they inserted a canula for ease into her upper arm. To my knowledge, they should put canulas into the back of your hand.   After they took it out and she came home, she suffered pain and a burning sensation in the canula site area. She hasn't been able to use her arm as she normally would have been doing, and has had endless trips to the doctor about it.   First the doctor thought that it was an infection, but after two courses of useless anti-biotics, and more trips back to the doctors, it has not improved.   The doctor has had a thought that the supposedly infected area is not infected at all, it could be damaged in some way.   We wonder if it is possible for us to sue the hospital on grounds of negligence, as she cannot use her arm properly and is in great pain, as I said before.      Thanks for your help.

NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME   "Yesterday (Barack Obama) went on national television to say he 'made a mistake,' apparently referring to the Tom Daschle and Tim Geithner tax snafus. But he could have meant any number of screwups. Bill Richardson's withdrawal as Commerce Secretary over a federal corruption probe in New Mexico already seems like ancient history.   "...The running theme here that connects Geithner, Daschle, Richardson and Blagojevich is not a flattering one. Mr. Obama has not demonstrated the executive leadership Americans expect of their president. Two of his former opponents once questioned whether Mr. Obama was 'ready to lead' and whether the presidency should be an 'entry level' job. Perhaps John McCain and Joe Biden were on to something."   - Brendan Miniter, Political Diary, 2/4/09

Enlarge Image CIA Realizes It's Been Using Black Highlighters All These Years      CIA Director Porter Goss.      According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.      CIA Director Porter Goss has ordered further internal investigation.      "Why did it go on for this long, and this far?" said Goss in a press conference called shortly after the report's release. "I'm as frustrated as anyone. You can't read a single thing that's been highlighted.

Now that the glow of the campaign is over and the media starts asking questions his press secretary stutters non-stop, Obama has to call emergency interviews with all the anchors to admit his mistakes in order to try and salvage a massive pork bill he is trying to get passed.   For those who took the time to investigate this man-we found the most liberal senator in the Senate who hadn't even served one term.  A politician who voted "present" more than actual yes or no votes.  A politician who ran around with the sleaziest people in Chicago to form a political career.   What concerns me the most is his total lack of experience and his judgment.  Tax cheats over and over again show a true lack of conviction and concern for the people of this nation.

On March 3rd 2001, my grandfather passed away. He had a will that stated that he was leaving his stamp collection to me & my two cousins, the stamp collection was to be sold & the money that we got for it was to be split three ways & my cousins and i were to have access to the money when we were 18 is we were in school or 21 if we weren't in school (something to that effect). We were able to get $1500 for the stamp collection. Now since I was only 14 when my grandfather passed away, my part of the money was put in my father's name. My father filed for bankruptcy, but before doing so he put the money i was to receive in my stepmother's name to avoid any complications. I'd asked my dad for the money many times & it was always a lame story as to why he didn't have it for me. My father passed away in September of 08, & I can't get ahold of my stepmother. How do I go about getting this issue resolved, if I'm even still entitled to the money. I know it doesn't sound like much, but I'm out of work right now & any little bit helps.       Also, my grandfather said in his will that the things in his house were to be divided between his 3 children & three grandchildren. We were able to go into the house & pick out things that we wanted. I picked out a bed of my grandmother's and a chair of hers. Those things are still in my stepmother's posession, along with things of mine from when I was a baby.      Can someone please tell me what I need to do to get these things?      Thanks in advance.      Please, no rude answers. This is a difficult enough situation since my father passed away, I don't need any rude comments towards it.

They had done the same with eldest daughter inlaw, whose parents then bought a separate house for the couple for their daughter's peaceful life.....!!!!!!!!!!

Plus daughter-in-law should bring salary and son should give everything to mom.......and make wife dependent for everything.....to have her controlled by him and mom-in-law.      After 10 months of try to save the marriage despite torture and humiliation, the wife left inlaws' house and has been living with her parents since ONE YEAR.........she contacted him due to attachment of 10 months of togetherness through calls and sms in first 3-4 months, but he never replied......because he had NO PERMISSION to talk to wife!!!!!!!!! He didnt develop any affection or attachment ????? He slept together for 10 months WITHOUT ANY FEELINGS????????????????????      Now, how to get rid of such a jerk?

I requested a note from my doctors office to be faxed to my place of employment. After faxing a release form, authorizing my health care provider to release information that I was seen for an appointment to my employer, my health care provider faxed my entire medical record. There were several different boxes indicating what information I authorized them to release, and I checked "other" and wrote in "confirmation of appointment on Fri 1/30/09" I did not check the box which said "entire medical file" Since I work for a different health care provider, it was assumed I wanted those records transferred. All of my sensitive health information then sat in the fax machine for 3 hours available for anyone to see, this included information about depression and treatment etc. I work in a small office, less than 20 employees, I can hardly stand to be at work anymore because I feel like all of the information I shared in the privacy of my doctor, is now known by everyone I work with. My boss brought me the fax, because someone took it from the fax machine and placed it in his mailbox. I feel very embarrassed now.

I have a question..   my friend Carol's parents are going to the US because Carol's brother petitioned their parents. So they are going to America for good. The were approved already...   Carol has a multiple visa and was invited by her brother also for a special occasion/affair.   At first, the parents will go there alone and it was filled up in their DS230 form .   The question was :   1. who are you travelling with? of course the parents answered their respective names... the husband answered his wife and vice versa   2. Anyone following after?   they answered not applicable coz no one's really following.   Now the DS230 and other requirements were already submitted..So the visa was approved and they were asked to go to America asap as according to the sched of departure..      Question :   Carol, the daughter was invited to attend an occasion in the States, so she arranged going to America together with her parents.    Will there be any conflict on this since the parents earlier stated that no other children is travelling with them? it was a last minute change w/c of course cannot be modified or edited on their DS230 since it was already forwarded..   Will this be a problem in the immigration once the plane landed US?   Thank you so much

How is it possible that the Governor of Illinois was able to be "tossed" out of office due to "Allegations" of corruption, before even going to court on the charges?      Will he be reinstated as the Governor of Illinois if he is found not guilty in a court of law?      What happened to the "slogan" you are innocence until proven guilty?"

20090205150718AAmZCea	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Opinions needed--Is it employment discrimination to do this?	I am female.  My employer transferred me from my skilled technical position into a janitorial position, and trained a man who has made my life hell for nearly 5 years on the job, using the b word, into my job.        They claim they want someone who can work both jobs--his and mine (well my former job I should say).  And yet I was not offered a chance to crosss train for HIS position.      His department is all-male, even so far as to exclude having women's restroom and changing rooms.  It always did make me angry that men in my job could further their career and training while women were excluded from doing so.  (They have never had a woman work that department.)      I can give further details if you ask for them and yes I do have a lawyer and am about to file a state human rights complaint followed by a lawsuit.      I was want to hear the opinions of other people though.        PS.  I was told that the man, because had experience on one, single computer application that the technical job needs, was and I quote, a "natural" for the job. However this is about maybe 5-10% of the job, and he had to train for the job....it's not as if he somply "slid" into my position.      I guess I want to know is, would YOU stay on as a janitor or quit?  I was told that I would be expected to leave the janitorial position (which come July I couldn't expect a payraise for) from time to time if the place got busy again, but I feel like they are using me and that having me help this man do the job that I never needed any help on is incredibly abusive of my employer. My replacement is making like 5.00 an hour more than me, and his skills for the other job will only come into play perhaps 10 percent of the time if even that much.
20090205151012AAQtaUw	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Canadian Age of Consent?	Well I'm 19 years old, and my girlfriend is 17 years old. We've been dating for a month and a half now and I've read the Canadian Age of Consent, which used to be 14 has been bumped upto 16 years old. Now she's older then that, so I guess technically she's of appropriate age them, correct?      We're planning on spending a night at a Motel in Ontario soon and I'm wondering, since I'll be paying in cash for the night, whether the Desk person will question our ages, though we both have ID's. Is it illegal for a 19 year old to have sex with a 17 year old in a motel/hotel in Ontario? I believe the age of consent in Canada is 16 at a federal level, I don't believe there is a provincial law for it.

OR if you have any advice on how to come up with 800 bucks quick, let me know.       serious answers only, please.
