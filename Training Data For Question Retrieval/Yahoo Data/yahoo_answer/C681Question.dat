20090307102354AAoXAt6	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend said she was "to busy"?	Okay well I asked my best friend if she could come over (not for a sleepover) on saturday to hang and help me with my homework project. She said she can't cause she has too much homework to do. She had a sleepover last night with her other friend and i invited my other friends over and they said they can come. I am really offended. What should I do?      No mean comments please
20090307102308AAbYwRK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she like me????	There is this girl I like in my English class, and we just met this year, and we are friends/acquaintances. So she like this boy in one of her classes( I found out through a friend thats in her class). But the thing is, ever since January, she's been looking at me everyday in class. If I catch her, she quickly looks away or keeps on staring. We talk as normal friends, and she sometimes giggles and looks at the floor, and once, she blushed right in front of me. I asked her why does she always look at me, and she sad she's really random, but I dont believe her. She looks at me every single day, and will sometimes try to get really close to me if she has a chance. So does she like me?
20090307102347AAb2Uvg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do i like him, or should i forget it?	my friend wanted me to meet he brother Dominic last night. i really wanted to meet him because everyone said he was so cute. when i got with my friend and i saw him, i thought he was super cute, we started to talk and hang out a little more. then my friend saw her other friend and went over to talk to her, and dominic started to talk to me about going out to eat. i said yes and he told my friend we were gonna go. she sent us by ourselves because she wants us to hook up. when we got to the restraunt, he pulled out my chair and we began to talk. i think i like him but im not sure. the only thing is, he's going out with my other friend is going out with him and i think his sister just wants me to go out with him to break them up because she ( his girlfriend )   is kinda ugly. what do i do?
20090307102334AAU8pjP	Family & Relationships;Friends	What can i do to hang out with my friends besides go to the movies?

And parties here suck so thats not one either. Any suggestions?
20090307102351AAjNr1k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	SHE RESPONDED TO MY TEXT LIKE THIS...PLEASE HELP PLEASE!?	i said to this girl "hey i think im coming home this weekend, are you free at all to go to lunch or dinner?" she replied "uhhhm maybe sunday, i gotta double check tho"-that was thursday      then last night she text me saying "HAPPY L-DAWG DAY!!!!"...a holiday we made up last time she came up (which is on march 7)      at first i thought her response was avoiding me (she was supposed to come up and visit us at college but she said her uncle died and the wake would PROBABLY be this weekend)...so do you think her answer is her avoiding me or if she was avoiding me would she just say no or ignore me..(i sent her flowers for VDAY so she must know i like her)

20090307102409AAAXyfY	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ladies what would you do i need your opinion?	If you denied the good guy which was your friend because you had a bf who hits you and treated you bad (And is also a Drugi he does alot of drugs and still does as of today). She also lost virginity with him at 15 . Wanted to stay with the bad guy, and you stop talking because you tried to save her and she called you out for being jealous. So years later you see your friend that would have treated you like a queen rolling in a lamborghini and being rich.      So what would you do if you were that girl?      I em that guy, and i had not seen her in years but i know where she lives. She was my first loved one. I also heard she has a kid but i em not sure.
20090307102458AAao8ta	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What happened to the man I dated?	6 years and 2 kids later, I can't find the man I dated in my husband. Although I feel ashamed to complain when he's not cheating or beating on me, I think that we both deserve more out of life. I can go through a whole week without having an influence on his, and visa verse. The man who was so involved in my life, and attentive, and sure of the role he wanted to play in his children's lives has become a stranger to us all, too busy to spend time with anyone. I've tried telling him how I feel many times, and have suggested going to counseling, but he's not interested. Is it time to get out?

20090307102724AAYBNrI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why did he get annoyed?	There were feelings of love between me and this guy for years, but it's all over now. We still talk, but there is tension and abs no chemistry anymore. He talks to these two women in front of me, they are friends of his.He cuts me out completely so I move away a bit to let him at it, I notice him looking over and grinning to himself. One of them is very pretty, so when the girls are gone, I just say that she is a very pretty girl and dresses very nice. He gets pissed off with me? Hello? 'Yeah she dresses well, very artistic', he says but it obviously pissed at me. WTF? I couldn't have been more normal if I tried and did not behave in any way jealous. What gives? I cant agree with him now?
20090505130509AAS8bIP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I overreacting or jumping to conclusions?	Well, Today I was checking my husbands email,(he cheated on me through online, CL, a year ago, and since then he knows I look at his email once in a while) and I saw this email he had sent to what appears to be a female email address, he sent a pic of himself(the same pic he sent me after we met online!) nothing else in the email, just the pic. I text him about an hour ago asking him to just be honest to me and tell me what's up, no reply yet. Am I overreacting? I don't want to be hurt again, do you think there is another explanation for it?

20090307102803AA7aYs1	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Am I wrong for feeling bored when my boyfriend talks about computer/tech/geek stuff?	So my boyfriend is SUPER smart.  He is amazing with computers and electronics, and pretty much knows everything when it comes to technology and science.  He blows me away sometimes because he will tell me about something, and I just look at him and go, "How the hell do you know so much?"  I really am turned on by how intelligent he is, and how he takes it upon himself to researches a lot of these things out of his own curiosity.        Here's my problem.        Some times he is really excited about these "tech things", like about a new project he thought of, or something he learned in Java class, or something he was going to do to his MacBook or desktop, or something they were talking about on the Apple Podcast.  It is cute at first to see him so passionate and excited about stuff, but then I turn into the bad girlfriend and I start to get bored because as cool as these things are to him, I don't know too much about that kind of stuff.  The problem occurs when he starts explaining how he did something, like how to make Java code or how to fix a router or turn a Play Station 3 into a computer with Linux.  Don't even get me started on Apple stuff.  I can't help but start to feel bored and annoyed when he starts going into depth about how he does what he does.  To me he is practically talking in another language....computer nerd language.  Don't get me wrong, I love his nerd side.  I love that he knows how to do cool stuff and fix things all on his own.  I am not saying that I am not interested in him or the stuff he builds or does....it's just when he starts dragging on the conversation by telling me everything that he knows about it, and all the steps and how he did it exactly....by the time he is done, my attention usually gets diverted elsewhere.  I guess he's been picking up on this lately, so he told me that its really been annoying him because I will just try to change the subject or close my eyes if we are in the car, and that I don't care that he is talking to me about stuff that interests him.  I was honest and I told him that sometimes I just get bored listening to him talk about all the details when it comes to the "techy stuff".  Am I being unreasonable?  I get it if he feels hurt because I don't care about his interests...but it's not that I don't care about his interests.  If he just kept a lot of the details about it short and sweet, I might have a chance to develop an interest in it on my own.  A lot of the times, he just goes right into this "geek talk" mode and assumes that my brain can process all that information!  I don't mind hearing about it, I just can't always handle him trying to teach all that information to me when it is something that I do not care too much about or know much about.  That would be like making him listen to me talk about what Kim Kardashian eats for breakfast and dinner every day, or something completely girly and to him, stupid.  Am I being unreasonable, or can we still have a relationship where we talk about things that are interesting to both of us and not so much of the overwhelming nerd talk?

20060620201953AANHl8N	Family & Relationships;Friends	Guy Problem...HELP!?	Ok...nothing to do with love or anything, but I met this guy on a youth group trip to Ceder Point and we had fun talking so now we talk alot on I.M.  We would stay up till 1:00 talking, and I could tell he was staying up to talk because the instant I went away, he did too.  One of the things that got us talking alot was that he was training me to not be a noob (someone who doesn't play alot of video games).  Alot of girls are a "noobs" and I really didn't see the point cause alot of the non-noobs were REALLY wierd...not saying all are.  I kinda stopped the whole "training" thing.  Now he doesn't seem to interested in talking to me.  We still talk but is this guy only talking to me because I was the only girl who lasted in noob training?  (He said all the other girls didn't give it a chance.)

20060709050247AAkqW6W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is interracial dating such a taboo?	To give an example, Hollywood which boasts of the most liberal setting has yet to pair a black actor with a white actress in a main-stream movie. Go to imdb and list all the movies with Denzel Washington, Will Smith or any other leading black actors and see how many movies are out there where they have been romantically paired with a white actress. None!!! I have yet to see Denzel Washington kiss a white actress on screen.   Note that people are more accepting of a seeing a white actor with a black or minority actress than the other way around, since historically women have been viewed as possessions and it would be blasphemous to see a black man possess a white woman!       Please do not mention Jugle fever. It specifically dealt with interracial dating and was made more than 10 years ago!!

20060807002523AA9KTC0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I admire someone, I think I'm a year ahead from him. I don't know how will we be able to have a communication.	We are studying at the same university. I know his full name but he doesn't know mine. Somehow my face and nickname. We met each other when I borrowed his tennis racquet for a competition. I gave him a thank you letter. I wrote my nickname. We always see each other at the hallways but I'm always the one making the effort to him. But then, whenever he sees me, he smiles and I smile back. don't know if he has a girlfriend because I've never seen him yet with one. Though today, I saw him talking to girl on the corridor. Their not sweet or they don't show any demonstration that they have intimate relationship but they seem to be talking seriously. I realy really want to establish a communication to him either through phone or personal. but I'm heasitant to ask his number beacuse I don't want to be obvious with my feelings of admiration.How can i get his number without looking so desperate or how can I give him a good impression? What's the most charming thing I can do to get his attention?

Your touch feels so warm, your lips like a feather.   But I open my eyes and know our love can not be.   There are too many places to go, and too many people to see.   And though a shimmer of hope sais your love is in sight,   I know it's just me, saying that the false just might.

20061206154422AAWrkcp	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My question is what do you do when someone has your kids who are also there kids too and wont give them back?	I dont know where they are,their father is unstable and he is a drug addict. I know I have to trust in the Lord but I need other help too. The cops cant help and legal services cant help all because he signed the birthcertificate. I trusted him even after he went to jail to visit with our kids because I thought jail changed people but apparently only people change if they want to. I live in Kalamazoo Mi and Chicago is so bigthat he can be anywhere with our 3yr old son and 4yr old daughter. I have been trying to get him to return them for 7 months. I only talk to his mom and she is going to protect her drug addict son no matter what. My family went to the cops and there was nothing they could do about it either. I dont graduate for about 3 mths now and my school told me if I miss another day I will be dropped from the Medical Assisting program. I cant afford to do that because I want to be able to have something for my children. All four. I have a 9yr old & 7yr old at home also.

20090227141646AAVEc4G	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im curious....has anyone ever changed their life around completely after going through?	bad relationships.  I know a girl that went through numerous bad relationships, only to find out (her view) that she screwed up and it was all her fault.  She decided one day to just walk away from it all and completely did a 360, but not for the good.  She turned to alcohol and refused to date anyone, although no one ever bothered with her.  Her family and friends had abandoned her and made her believe that she was a bad person.  She couldnt forgive herself and eventually the stress killed her.  Isnt this a sad story?  And dont you think that it happens in real life?  This was a person that had a good life and because of her choices to divorce, she lost everything.  She spent all her savings and in the midst of it all met a guy that claimed to love her and he basically just used her.  She met other people that claimed to be her friends, but no one ever called her or bothered to ask how she was, not even her own mother.  Pathetic, isnt it?  But a true story.  My questions is, if you had a friend like this, wouldnt you have tried to talk to her and tell her she was worth something?  And if you were related to her, wouldnt you want to help her?  She did a good job of hiding it, but wouldnt you know by that, that she needed love and support?

20090227140759AAtmUAg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Playing Your Cards While Dating?	I've been seeing this guy for 3 months now and I do the unavailability thing. Sometimes I turn my phone off just so that I won't be tempted to answer when he calls and make plans to see him at the last minute.      Well Wednesday, I had my phone off the whole night and decided to do me.  A quiet evening at home in front of the TV.  When he called me last night he asked why I didn't answer when he called the night before.  I told him the truth that I turned it off and was in chill mode.  We did however spend the whole night together last night and he kept talking about how I didn't answer his call and he thought that I was maybe with another man.      He said, you not answering my calls, is that how you're playing your cards now?  What did he mean by that.  He doesn't always answer when I call him or jump to call me back and he hardly ever responds to my texts.  So why was he making a big deal out of me not answering his call one night & what did he mean by is that how I'm choosing to play my cards now?

20070407163358AADIQGO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do?!?!?!?!?!??!?	I am 14 and haven't started dating yet.  None of my friends have started dating yet either.  But, all around me in magazines and on tv I see girls around my age dating.  It makes me think that I am strange or weird because I don't feel ready to date yet.  Whenever I talk to my mom about it she says "There is no rush to start dating, I didn't even date when I was in high school."  What should I do?  It really bothers me though because I have NO experience with guys.  I haven't even kissed a guy yet.  When did you all start dating?
20070603200107AA1FRao	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Major relationship advice needed?	There's these two girls I really like. One lives in Ohio with me, the other in New Jersey.    I'm practically in love with the one in Ohio, and she really likes me, and the one in NJ loves me, and I really like her. I cant live without either one.       I've tried to keep the two from knowing each other, but now there's a huge problem. In mid-July, I'm going to NYC, the NJ girl is meeting me there, and the girl from here is also going to NYC with me. There is almost no way to avoid them two meeting. How can I break it to both of them about each other beforehand without either one getting hurt?       I should also add that, although there is two girls, there is a good reason for it. The OH girl stopped liking me for a while cuz she began dating another guy, so I started talking to the NJ girl. Now the OH girl is single and likes me again, and the NJ girl already loves me. I know someone will get hurt by this, but how can i soften the blow?

20070425081510AAryrb8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you prefer a large height difference in a relationship?	I'm a very active guy, like playing all kinds of sports. I'm 5'11, anything under 5'4, usually 5'5, makes it hard for us to do some activities together, so I usually prefer taller women. I see some couples with over a foot height difference, that is kinda weird: What do you prefer?      Though height is less important to me than most  women. Most shorter girls want to be dwarfed, and some guys are into that kind of thing.

20070325170426AAsl83X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I cant keep a relationship i NEED HELP?	every time i start a new relationship, or start looking at a girl with potential it almost stops immediately, because when i start one i always have a thought nagging me in the back of my mind and that is what if the girl i really like becomes available then i wont be, she is also my best friend, i love her to death i only want to care for her and hold her when she is upset, it just really bothers me because this has been going on for nearly 6 months, ive only had one relationship since then and it only lasted about a week before the little thought came back, plus the girl i was dating was i found out later basically a walking STD, and im glad i didnt do anything with her, but this is just killing because i want to tell the girl who im falling in love with how i feel, i just adore her more every day, and it is just killing me inside, please tell me what you guys think

20070504045531AA1SYYo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend got fat and doesn't care about his appearance anymore?	My boyfriend has gained quite a bit of weight since we started going out 3 years ago. Im not going to lie and say it doesn't bother me, because it does. I have maintained my weight and I put effort into looking nice for him by dressing up and wearing makeup. He on the other hand never puts effort into his appearance anymore and has let his weight go. It has also effected our sex life as well because he is not as physical or vigorous anymore. I love him to death and I would not leave him over this but I miss lusting for him and being so madly attracted to him. I have read some other answers on here to similar questions and many users criticize the asker by telling them they are superficial and they should not care about their partner's looks. That is just wrong. Physical attractiveness is important in a relationship. What should I do to let him know how he has become? He has been saying for about a year now he will lose weight and he has done nothing.

20090227141604AAngL0g	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I confronted my husband about his cocain use, he says he doesn't need it, he needs me.  He did not deny it.?	Says he will quit for me. We went to bible study 2 days later and someone called him out and prayed with him and rebuked the spirits of depression, anger and addiction out of him. This person did not know us or that we were going through this. I guess I just want to know if anyone thinks he will use again. This is my first time confronting him about it and I had left for 4 days, now I am back. What can I expect?"
20090227140436AA3xPr4	Family & Relationships;Friends	A gay friendly question?	I've been having some back pain, a slipped disc, a pinched nerve, i find it difficult to get around.  I posted an add in the platonic section of Craigslist, asking maybe someone lived in my area and wanted to come and give me some company, or any advice ect...I also clearly stated that I'm straight and single.  I got only two replies back... one from a man wanting to come to my house and perform falacio, to make me feel better.  I ignored this.. another from a fellow going to massage therapy school.  There were several emails exchanged as he asked about specifics and I explained what I was doing. These emails were spaced several days, up to 48 hours apart.  I'm not ready for massage therapy, as I'm still in the acute stage, but he suggested he come down and we meet for coffee, simply to alleviate my boredom.  He also said "but before we do that, i want to be upfront with you. i am a decent gay man. 90% of my friends are straight  if that helps to address any concern about you being friends/ acquaintances with a gay dude."   Well, I'm fairly gay friendly.. I live in Vancouver, which has a large gay population. I was brought up in an extremely liberal family.  So, naturally I wouldn't have a problem being acquainted with a gay man, and I appreciated his honesty.  I became a little concerned about his intentions, as the other fellow was upfront about what he wanted to do for me.  So, I pondered this for a day.  Keep in mind, we have a history of not replying to emails immediately.  24 hours later, before I chose to get back to him, I received this :   "i guess my being gay was an issue then. this makes me sad but you know what, people like you will learn one day that just because i am gay, it does not make me a bad person.   and as far as i can remember, i have been nothing but a decent person to you."      I'm more taken aback by this e-mail and accusation than by the fact he is a gay man.  I've since emailed him, told him this is not the case, and explained how it was slightly unreasonable for him to become upset that I didn't respond right away.  He's apologized and owned up to being sensitive and reacting too quickly.  But still, I don't know if I want to associate closely with someone who reacts so harshly, i'm a nice person, but I don't want to analyze what I do so I don't offend him.      I'm not sure what I'm asking... Should I have gotten back to him right away?  Should I be concerned about his intentions? Is it normal for a gay man to be so sensitive?  Should I meet him for coffee regardless of my concerns?  Do i even have a right to be concerned?      sorry for such a long winded explanation to the simple question. I know it took commitment to read through all of it.  It's just bothering me that I may have not been sensitive enough, and I'd like others opinions.

20090227135634AA65h8t	Family & Relationships;Friends	I want to repair any damage that has been done, but can I?	I have this guy friend and well we basically we have been through a lot, I mean a whole lot.    We about dated but he only wanted to be friend, he’s suggested we hang out but we never made official plans to, we argued but we always made up, it sometimes seems like he likes me cause he’ll act towards me the way he did when we were talking, but he says he only likes me as a friend.    I’ve tried to get over him, but I don’t know its like something always brings him back to me. And then me and him will end up texting a lot again and I’ll fall for him.   He use to smile at me with a huge grin on his face and his eyes would get huge, now we don’t have hardly any classes near each other and when I do see him we just look at each other, sometimes we I guess you can say we just stare at each other. He’ll look at me with a longing gaze.    I miss like how things were, now it seems like we hardly talk. I texted him yesterday but he plays a sport at school and they had a game so he didn’t text me back.   I want to repair any damage that has been done, but can I?    I know he probably cares about me but we haven’t spoken to each other in over a week.  He’s 17 and I’m 16.

20090227141644AA5F0Pr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help! My boyfriend is always texting some girl that he knows and sometimes up to 12 consistent hours!!?	We have been together for more than a year and we currently live together. Around 4 months ago I found out that my bf was texting a girl for like 10-12 hours while at work. When I confronted him about it he said they were just friends who had met at where he was working and that nothing was going on..I didn't believe him so I broke it off.  We got back together a week after that because he came back and said it was stupid he loved me and bla bla bla. A month later I found out that he had slept with her just 2-3 days after we had broken up!!! long story short....We are still together, but he's always texting some girl man...it goes good for a couple months and then a new girl I have never heard of (supposedely past friends) starts texting him...He even went out to lunch with one and lied about it.      He's great with me and I know he loves me but why does he have to keep texting girlfriends for soo long?? I would stop talking to any guy for him because I love him. why can't he do the same?      The problem here is that he doesn't text them for an hour or two..no he does it the whole freaking day nonstop. and then says there's nothing wrong with it.  I just found out that he's doing it again..he says there just friends...but seriously 12 hours of texting???

20070520120321AAuXHBp	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Close knit families...would you like one?	I am a pretty independent guy, and my family is not close knit.  We see eachother every couple of weeks sometimes months will go by.  And we never really get together.  I have found that the family is more interested in my on goings when I am furthest away, for instance when I was in the Marine Corps 1/2way around the world is the only time I felt like they WANTED to see me.         My last girlfriends family was just the opposite they were close knit...I liked it at first, but it became annoying after awhile because they were always in our buisness.  Always expecting us to go over for dinner and do stuff with them, Never left much time for me.      Which would you prefer?

20070505222038AA30oNM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I get back with my Ex boyfriend? [complicated?]?	My ex boyfriend and I were going out for about 10 months. i'm 17 he's 19. It was going great until maybe the last 2 months. We started having issues when we couldn't agree on some things. Like visiting times and how often we got to see each other & etc. [He lives about 40mins away] It was because of school that we started having some fights and some personal attributes we both had that we wanted to change, but didn't seem to have a serious significant change. The whole point is that, we broke up, but we both still "love" each other, sometimes he doesn't believe me cause i was the one who broke it off for school and such, but i guess i cant blame him when he says other people can juggle relationships&school&work&friends, but i guess thats something i have to work on after my junior year ends. There are things that we both need to change, but i want to know if i should take the trouble to get back cause i've had other relationships and for some reason cant let this one go...

A month ago the guy I was seeing came over and broke up with me, but the whole time he was telling me his reasons he would hug me and kiss my cheeks and forehead and rub my knee.

20070511023516AA0UMVz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do girls view guys that are their friends as dateable?	I seem to have this stigmatism about making a move on a girl. The only girlfriends I've had I became friends with first, and THEY made the first move on ME.      While I have no problem with that, I want to learn how to ask girls out myself, since that is the social norm. I just moved to college and I've made quantum leaps in socializing with girls; where I used to be almost unable to talk to them, I now hang out with many of them now and have fun. But my problem is that's all I can seem to do. Once I meet a girl, I talk with her, hang out, get to know her, and become her friend. And I just don't know what to do beyond that, because I lacked a lot of female interaction growing up.      So girls (and guys, your advice is welcome, too), this is my question to you: If your friend asked you out, say a good friend, would you take him up on it?  How can I learn to ask out women I'm not yet friends with if I don't know that much about them?

20070514111407AA3w0ib	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why Do I love Boys So much??	Hello, I am 19 and love boys from the ages of 11-16 with all my heart and soul! Ever since I was 11 years old I have felt emotionally, physically and spiritually attracted to them!! I care deeply about the needs, happiness and over all well being for boys. I feel like it was my destiny to work with boys. Using my vast knowledge to help protect them from the corruption, see things clearly in a brain washed society, and get ahead in every aspect of life. There cannot possibly be a more powerful love then the way I feel for boys! I have Asperger syndrome meaning that social and communication skills don't come natural to me, so in school I really had no friends. But what kills me most is I had many hot boys stare and wink at me in the halls. But I was to shy to talk or make the next move. I concluded there are 2 classifications of gay people. Type A boys who like other boys only 11-16 and will always only like that age group. Type B boys which are attracted to guys in general.(less common
20070515024619AAWL9sp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Racing questions in my head:?	If you were atracted to someone and you got along great, but realized that you had nothing in common, would you not see that person anymore just because of that? If you were way too atracted to someone and wanted to get rid of the atraction, would it help if you have a staring contest or would it just make things worse?

Come on guys this is your time to shine with honest info..... I felt confident enough to get the question out in the opn air.

After finding out that I moved to the suburbs, a couple months later he bought a property and recently moved there to. So what going on?

It sounds kind of fun but I dont really know what to do after I tied him up other than the regular bj etc, what else is there? And what's in it for me other than having fun and riding him?      What are some things that I can do to really get him rock hard and asking for it? I'm more submissive and kind of at a lack of ideas here. Also if you have any ideas how I should dress up. Maybe some lingerie? I really want to get him excited.      Thank You!!!

20070529232206AA8wz1W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do?	15 years ago I fell in love with someone.  We were both in high school at the time.  We never actually "dated', but we hung out together at school.  His family was better off financially than mine and his mother thought I wasn't "good enough" for him. At the time I was in several choirs and had dreams of being on Broadway some day so he used to sneak his mom's musical soundtracks out so that I could copy them.  When he graduated from school and went to college, he gave me his address and asked me to write to him, but I was afraid.  Every time I sat down to write him, I would start pouring my heart out about how much I cared for him and I would put it off - But no matter how much time goes by, I still think of him at least once every day.  I've had other relationships, but I always felt like I was settling for second choice because I couldn't have the one I really wanted.  Recently I found his address online - he's a college professor now. (continued below)
20070531124126AAcS94Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm separating from my wife, I have a close girlfriend that I dont wanna hurt?	Me and my wife, are studying outboard. Here I met a girl, she has been my friend, and in some way she has been the witness of how my marriage collapsed. We've never talked about love or something related. We've been just friends, good chats and coffees. However I am trying to be very careful to go onto a rebound relationship. I dont wanna hurt her promising things that I know I can't do now. I said to her that I will divorce as soon as I get back to my country. But I've never said " I will divorce because I love you". Yesterday we chatted and I said to her that I will need time to recover and clean myself from this earthquake, and I told her that I want to come back to study again to this country, but not letting her know that she is the reason to come back, because I also do not know if she loves or not. She is my friend and I think that if I open my mouth too much I will screw it up... what do you think .. am I doing right asking for space and time, and not promising anything???

20070601225403AAl2A1q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So should I flirt with him or just let him be?	OK weve been friends this whole year, really good friends. At the begging of the year it was more like I was picking on him calling him names just to get on his nerves cuz at the time I didnt like him, and later on as the year progressed, i kinda remember he was like always asking me who I liked or something but I didnt think much of it because..well I didnt like him. Until about the last quarter of the year we started to flirt alot like online, myspace and at school. But now im starting to find that this freshmen girl realy likes him and is always flirting with him and talking to him on msn, myspace and on the phone. And he doesent talk to me like he use to, but on the last day of school he added me to his top friends list on myspace, but im after that other girl and i dont know I always heard and could tell that he likes to flirt with girls so do you think i should just let him be or should i go for him?

They say if you've been dating a guy for a while (lets say 3-4 months and the dates are great) and he hasn't tried to get you in bed. Then he's respecting you and considering long term. Is this true? Also if my boyfriend is shy is it ok for me to make the first move and kiss me? Will I look desperate to him?

20070616135018AAbQpDh	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Como supero una infidelidad ??	Saludos a todos !!   Ya ha pasado mas de un a?o desde que mi exesposa me fue infiel y No he podido superar esa infidelidad femenina... entre mas sé de ella, mas he visto que me enga?aba y me mentia...    Lamentablemente muchas cosas nos unen, entre ellas 2 hijos y yo trabajo donde ella trabaja y donde la tercera persona tambien laboro... eso me trae recuerdos y cada que piso mi trabajo es iniciar el dolor interminable...    Actualmente ella esta con esa persona y yo he tenido parejas pero ninguna ha tapado el hueco que esta dejo... hoy en dia mi orgullo sigue lastimado y sigo humillado y desgastado de tanto pensar y ella aparentemente es feliz y eso me llena de rencor y melancolia.    Quisiera No ser tan desesperado en encontrar algun amor ya que sé que llegara pero todavia NO lo tengo... que puedo hacer para superar este estado de animo...?? he buscado amigos de la infancia y salgo con chicas pero sigo deprimiendome cada vez mas !!  el tiempo todo lo cura pero cuanto mas debe pasar ??

20090227141317AAWyfMF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	For my sanity, is my marriage over?	First off, I would like to say I do honestly love my husband.       My husband and I have always had a rocky relationship. In the past he (never hit me, but) would push me during intense fights, or hold me hold and scream in my face. He hasn't done anything like this in about a year in a half- and I don't think he will again. We got married young, I was 19 he was 20. We've been married over a year now. We fight, over stupid things. I even moved out for a couple months last year- but came back.       We get in HUGE fights were things almost end. We have these fights about once every 2 months. Last night, we fought and he threatened to kill himself (not his first time threatening). He was driving around and wouldn't tell me where he was. He also punched 2 holes in our doors.    I love him,but we can't seem to break the cycle. Plus, he doesn't fully support my future career path. I don't know what to do- and I know neither of us are happy. I don't know if I'm even still IN love with him.    Also, I know I'm young, but I'm a big girl. Don't tell me I was to young (I'm starting to realize that and don't need to be reminded), and please don't condescend me- I'm looking for honest advice. Thanks all.

I asked this question earlier and did not get much of a response, so I am trying again...please answer!         I lost my virginity to a close guy friend about a year ago.  I had never really thought of him as anything more than platonic, and was never interested in dating him. I chose to sleep with him because I trusted him and felt completely comfortable around him.  I never really thought much about him, nor did I feel any sort of attachment to him (other than platonically).   Now that we've slept together it's completely different. I miss him all the time and think about him constantly. I never thought I'd get attached. Why did this happen? He's still the same person, I don't get it. I don't understand my feelings...can anyone explain this?  Also, he doesn't talk to me anymore which really hurts my feelings and goes against everything I thought he was.  I don't understand why he'd pull away after something like this, he always seemed like such a sensitive caring person.  I don't understand.

20081105030147AAKmgRa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm confused ???Why would he do this?	I was in a 4 year relationship with the father of my children and discovered that he was being unfaithful.I found out who the girl was by checking his phone (she was always a missed call)I called her and she would cover for him saying they were just firends.Until one day she called his phone I answered it and she gave me attitude.She finally told me everything.  He told her we were together and how much he loves me (she said)but he was sleeping with her!!!(Odd) Why would he discuss our relationship with a girl he's cheating with she knew so much about ME.She told me how i put him down because he was struggling looking for another job because he was layed off (ok i called him a loser a couple of times in a heated arguement) but i don't he's just always been upset that i made more money than him.What's weird is she said she didn't talk to him anymore because he was always asking her for money this is crazy .Now he wants us to get back together and work it out...Should i give him a second chance???How can we possibly make a relationship work if he's insecure that i make more money than him he shouldn't feel less of a man for that.He should have felt less of a man for begging the girl he cheated on me with for money...Like i said i'm confused

He invades my thoughts.Everytime I see or do something that he likes,I remember him.   Coincidently a lot of things are have happened recently that remind me of him.   Every moment my eyes are open he's always in my thoughts.   This has been happening for 6 months now.   We communicate with each other regularly since he works overseas.We are from two different countries,and he has a girlfriend.      Three days ago,we had a long voice conference on the computer and he asked me if I liked anyone.I wanted to say no,but I never lied to him.So I said yes,but I can't tell him who he is,he kept proging me to tell but finally give up on me.He's giving me too many mixed signals.      I don't know how to react to this situation.      Any advice?I would really appreciate it.   Thanks.

20081101141237AAzfbXI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My wife is a bad mother.  What should I do?	She is fine with our two little girls but terrible to my step son who is almost 15.  It's like she resents his old man not being around since he was like 4 months old.  She constantly yells at him and does not treat him very fairly.        He has a lot of issues with the law.  He has been in a lot of legal trouble.  Yesterday she would not let him go out with his buddies on Halloween, which may be a good thing, but they got into it, and he pushed her (I was at work) and now he's locked up again.      I don't know what to do.  As soon as I get home from work, she will leave the house.  She drinks too much Crown Royal/Segrams 7 and smokes way too much Mary Jane.  No job either, yet put 17,000 miles on her car this year.  Repeat, 17,000 miles in one year.      I'm at a loss.  I need advice.  I'd tell me to take the kids and go.  Keep in mind I work 9-9 and I work Saturdays.  No daycare available at those hours, even if I could afford it, which in this economy, I can't.

Ok, so I'm 21 and this girl who I have been friends with for about a year is 19, and she is one of my really good friends. Over the past year or so that I've known her we really bonded and she has a lot of qualities that I look for such as she's attractive, down to earth, smart, easy to talk to, likes my sort of cynical personality etc. Anyway, last year when I was first getting to know her I basically made it a point one night to tell her straight forward that I liked her etc, and she basically just said that she wasn't interested right now etc cause there was someone else, but she wanted to be friends and thought i was great etc. anyway, this past sunday we were both at a party at my place really drunk and ended up hooking up and it got really intense, but it was nice. So the thing is right now I don't really know how to go about it. I mean i know we both sort of like each other, but at the same time I don't want to start pursuing her and lose her altogether. Any ideas??

I have this teacher for my second period class and he's kind of a pushover. Theres this student in my class who is kind of weird. I don't mean weird in a mean way, but he's not right. My teacher says he's not like us, so I'm guessing theres something mentally wrong. But he constantly bugs me. He sits across the room yet he constantly stares at me and he says things to other students like racist stuff and cuses at them. He always starts it and rather than him getting sent outside the other student does and hes gets absolutely no punishment for what he says or does. It annoys me. I understand he's 'off ', but hes not totally clueless.       Like today in my second period class he said something to me about me being a F****** W**** loud enough for most people to hear and I told him to shut the F up. I probably shouldn't have cused but still. My teacher yelled at me to get out of his class and he didn't say anything to the kid. Any Advice? The kid never stops, everytime I see him he says something.

20081106145839AAtM2Fv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Before marrying some one?	If your engaged to a man who lied repeatedly, broken promises ... and you decided to forgive him and forget (kinda) but then he made some more mistakes that could have been prevented had he really thought it out and used common sense ... (I'm not talking about cheating) would you forget those things even if he apologized even if it made you uneasy again from all the hurt in the past .... (the hurt from the past consists of him flirting with waitresses in your face, gawking at other women and plain lying about things - during the dating stages) he never cheated on me physically ....      would you still go ahead with getting married or would you be concerned that he would break yet another promise after being married.      How much forgiveness can you give some one.. should I just accept him the way he is even if it bothers me that he makes mistakes .. I know we are not perfect ... no one is. The problem we had recently was him being overly friendly with a lady 3 years older than me .. it is a friend of mine who is sorta smiley and stuff .. haha.. naturally and she is flirtatious but not really attractive (no offense) I've asked him to turn it down a notch a couple of times before with being that way with other women (older) because I was trying to heal and I couldn't take it ..      Any input would be greatly appreciated - thanks so much for your time!

Everytime I looked down and then up again I would see him looking and smiling at me.   A couple days ago, me and him were partners and we were working on math problems and he would ask me the answer to some problem and I'd answer him and he'd go and check to make sure, so I'd always say "don't you believe me" and once he said "Of course I believe you, I just thought it looked wrong so I had to check.", and then this other girl(in our group) goes "Ya, you're very believable" so then he goes "ya..you are"

Well, I was talking to my boyfriend on the phone and I was watching "David Blaine" and I was telling him how I think it's interesting... he then starts to put it down, stating "I know exactly how he does it. It's all about camera angles. It's not even real... you'll never know how he does it. Why would you even want to watch it? It's so dumb". Things along those lines.       It just upsets me when he says these things. I called him a party pooper and that if he doesn't like something, it's "stupid". He got mad and said I was defending the show.      This is a STUPID argument. He then said "It's late. You've kept me up late again. Goodnight". I said "I love you"... no response. He also told me he didn't feel like he loved me... because of this crap! I kept on saying I love you and he wasn't answering... he just hung up.      Who's in the right, here?! Thanks in advance.

A bit of history real quick, two weeks prior to the event I'm about to mention I found her texting an old boyfriend, it was about nothing though. and she lied to me when I asked who it was when I had saw his name.

But, I find out from my girl's best friend an ex named Josh was at her house. i confront her and she says that when she feels like shes losing someone she lies and she doesn't want to. Then she gives me her life story about her rough upbringing and how it affected her mentally and I'm the first person she actually wants to get help so she doesn't be "that person" anymore and lie when she doesn't want to. She says lyings worked in the past, but now she sees what how bad it made me feel and she wants to do whatever it takes to get me back. If she really goes through with help, should i take her back

20070921060836AAghMTB	Family & Relationships;Friends	My uncle Died - Who was more than a father to me?	Saturday morning at 2:00 AM, my uncle in Pakistan died from a heart attack. He was himself a doctor and had no disease or sickness, he just passed away in his sleep peacefully & quietly at mere age of 50. My uncle, late uncle was more than a father to me, my mentor, my best friend, my older brother, he was EVERYTHING to me, especially because it was only his hand that held mine after my father's death in 1991 and gave us all so much love & care. He was truly a remarkable, generous and exceptional man.   Its one of the biggest tragedy in my family that I am so poorly equipped to deal with being so far away to even pay my final respects. It feels like If I have lost my father once again.    dont give me any advice, since I am sick of losing people I love or hold so dear, It does not make any sense. There are no words that can comfort me. My pain is to have lost him, and I was not there, I was there to hold his hand, to comfort him and to be there by his grave. how can one define death?

20080521202111AAqruWf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like this girl but I don't know what to do! Help Me!?	My name is Elijah. I like this girl who's name is Francisca Weber and she is the top freshman at my school but I don't know how to catch her attention. Sometimes in class I catch her staring at my eyes and sometimes at (other) parts of my body, but I am not sure if she likes me. I love to sing, play guitar, piano and love to write music. She has all those interests like me except for the guitar and writing music. Sometimes when I am around her she'll push out her chest. Is that her way of trying to catch my attention and sometimes she'll bring up things that I am interested in that nobody has ever heard her talk about before. I am just so confused. I asked my friend to ask her what she thinks about me, her response was "I think he's really cool". But I don't think my friend asked her the way I wanted him to ask her because she didn't say more.

He hasn't been coming around like he said he would. I really miss him, and i tell him that all the time.We love eachother so much. I don't know whats going on, he talks to me all day on the phone, and acts normal, but he'll say he doesn't feel like coming around because he's lazy. However, he goes out with his friends and hangs out with them.    I know it sounds like maybe he's being unfaithful, but there are no signs that he is. (He cheated one time 2 years ago. I broke up with him but we got back together, and have been together now for 1year and 2 months.)   I was just wondering what things i should say to him in order to get him to change his ways and actually come around like he says he will. I'm starting to grow insecure and less and less confident.   Please just give me some suggestions and advice, its really appreciated.
20070907201415AA9PZg5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Kinda confused...love or infatuation??	So I've liked this guy for almost 3 years, and i moved, so we didnt see eachother for almost 2. I've seen him twice since I've moved back (which was 9 months ago!!!) and everytime...it was like total happiness.       The thing is though, he's REALLY hot! But I've seen plenty of hot guys, and I don't think about them everyday. This guy has the sweetest, and most outgoing personality. He was soo much fun when we went to school together! But now that I never see him...I STILL like him for some reason. idk why i havent gotten bored with him.       The thing is...idk if i would still feel as strong about him if he was bald (he has really great hair) so that's infatuation...but there are plenty of hot guys, and I don't feel this way about them...      so am I in love, infatuated, both? Is there a word for this?? I know if I hung out with him more, I'd like him more for his personality.

20070912113752AAUNRQj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	From a Professional womans perspective???	I am a guy who just moved to Des Moines, IA. In the past I have been around college girls. Now it seems that most girls I run into or meet are young professionals. I am pretty good about keeping my clothing and shoes up to date and in style. What are good casual clothes that professional women like to see men in? Button up dress shirts with jeans and nice shoes? If button up, what kind? Buckle style with embroydery, striped, solid? Unique and interesting tee shirts? What kind of shoes? Square toed black dress shoes with jeans? brown steve madden shoes? shiny or the tennis shoe kind? What kind a jeans? Dark with nice dye in them (stonewash)? What about watches? Silver watch or leather band (fossil style)? Just lookin for some pointers. I would appreciate anyones help. I am not under the impression that fassion only gets girls...personality is much more important, but I do know that if you have style it doesn't hurt.
20070915155220AA9K43h	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Has anyone ever tried one of those singles mixers things?	I am working on trying to get over ex-boyfriend whom broke up with me last week.  I know I need to just get out and meet some new people. Not necessarily to date, but just to hang out.  My heart is still in pieces, but I do think getting out could be good. So I am looking on line at one of these clubs for singles and they are having some thing at a local bar as a mixer event. I have never done anything like that. Sounds terribly uncomfortable.  But I know I can't just live on Yahoo Answers also.  So what are your thoughts?

20071030122551AAAaKVY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I keep my relationship?	I have an awesome girlfriend, but in the past 18 months I have screwed up by lying. When we first got together I helped my ex paint and told my girlfriend that I was at my aunt's house. Then a few months later she saw that I had been communicating with my ex. Now, the latest lie was that I came out to my mother. The truth is, I tried, but my mother did not want to hear it. I told my girlfriend that I came out before I spoke with my mother and when my mother told me that she didn't want to hear it, I didn't push the issue and I never told my girlfriend any different.      Now, my girlfriend says that she is tired of my lying and doesn't know if she wants to be with me, despite the fact that we have said that each other are "the one" and I want to marry her. I know my track record sucks, but I am done with lying. How do I show my girlfriend. Any lie that I could tell is not worth losing her. I love her and I am going to be honest, even when it is hard. How can I show her and keep her?
20080609150957AAXEZ2s	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I pay for my ex's lawyer?	Last week my ex and I got into a drunken argument.  To make a long story short, I got locked out and continued to knock on the door.  She said that she was going to call the cops and I said I would do it first.  She said do it and I did.  She ended up getting arrested because she was not calm when the cops came and the one officer got annoyed.  She was scared and asking why he was there and requesting to call her father (a cop), but the cop did not like that and the fact that we were gay and arrested her for so-called assaulting him.  I feel bad because she would have never been arrested if I had not called the cops.  Since then she has been angry with me and rightfully so and has broken up with me.  The problem is we live together and she needed a lawyer.  I know a great lawyer since I am in law school, she will not have the money until Sept.  She asked me to put up the money and she would pay back half in Sept (half cuz my fault)...problem is, she is treating me like ****. do i pay?

20071103235355AADeF1A	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friends question?	Ok I have made really good friends with this girl She is awesome. I am also a girl and I kind of felt guilty when she came for a hug I kind of shrunk back and told her nope and ran off. I was kind of scared mainly cause I do not make freinds easily and I dont know wat it is I just feel awkward around her. I get like anxious and I guess in her words skittish. I dont understand why I do this. Once she said something about keeping in contact with me once I graduate it kind of suprised me and I was actually really shocked since I am not use to hearing that from someone. I am the really quiet type so I tend to kind of push others away once they get close but I have even told her that I will do this and I am actually scared I will succeed. I always get quiet around her and tend to be very distant. I have told her some very personaly things before so I dont know if its that or if I am afraid I will get hurt. SInce it seeems thats all that has happened to me in the past. What do you think? Plz
20071108113853AAhDZ9v	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he over our relationship? I’m starting to think it’s not working out..?	One of my friends’s got married last Sun. Right before the weekend, my boyfriend got sick. So he didn’t go to the wedding with me. He went to the doctor again but is not getting better. He told me that he probably can’t come this Sun. to the wedding either.   I know that it’s not his fault that he got sick. It’s just bad timing. My question is, is this a bad sign? I feel like we try to work on our relationship then things happen outside of our control that put us two steps back. I’m not upset with him; I’m just disappointed with the situation and feel really lonely. Not sure what to think these days.      I guess I'm still bothered because he had said over a month ago that he was going to get me a promise ring but hasn't. We were supposed to go look last weekend but he got sick.

20071129205514AAT9q6D	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im confused about how to respond to a guy! This may sound lame but; I need advice on how to answer him back!!!	I have recently gotten out of a 5yr relationship & I am moving real soon, in a month, and I have met a guy through facebook; one of the surrounding colleges & we have been talking. He wants to hang out & so do I, He brought it up & asked if I would want to go out on a dinner date, movie, or go dancing.      I think dancing would be a great idea; that way we won't be tied down to stay and could leave if one of us just wasn't "feeling" it!  Im only 20 so Im limited to certain dance clubs. I told him that dancing sounded like fun! Well, he responded with, "we can do whatever you want; dancing was just an idea"       What does that mean?! He doesn't want to go dancing? That he'd rather do something else? I don't want to be the one to say what we should do! So how do I tell him that without actually telling him I want him to choose? Im no good at this! He also has to travel about 50-70 miles to hang out. What should I respond with?!      Any type of advice will

20080105005602AAfH2nz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I've fallen for a new friend. Should I tell him?	It's September.There's a new guy in school&he just happens to be good looking&in my class.Not only that,but he actually talks to me.Bonus from the beginning.      It's now January.Over the past few months,we've talked&hung out.He's not an overly social fellow,&tends to listen more than speak.He keeps himself closed in&is hard to get anything out of-but yet when he does,he's kind,funny,understanding,&totally loveable.      We flirt all the time,therefore giving the image that the feeling is mutual.He also seems like the kind of guy that, knowing I like him even if it turns out it's not mutual, wouldn't get awkward around me-but it's not a known fact.      I sent him a New Year's text confessing my interest,but he's unsure of whether he got it or not. The truth? Who knows. I may not know if he got it or not,but I do know that he's unsure of whether he wants any relationships right now.       Should I bring it up&retell if he didn't get it or would it be too much of a risk as new friend?

We were together for 3 years, it was an amazing relationship until she asked for some space then went with another guy! She then was throwing being with him in my face and constantly hanging up on me then I would get so mad I would keep calling her... I made a mistake right there but now me and her have been on and off for about 10 months now and she says that she loves me, and I tell her that back, even though she messed up. But yeah for her telling me she loves me, she hardly ever returns my calls, answers her phone, or calls me back when she says she will...I get the impression that her saying that she loves me isnt going with her actions and she's taking my love for granted! She seems really attached and the longest we ever went without talking was 1 week, she also says that guy isnt in her life anymore which I dont believe cause his # is still there! And if she says that she loves me, then why arent we together? It seems like she only talks to me when she wants...not when I want.?

20080918132646AAvdZ1B	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does being in a relationship sometimes make a person more appealing to the opposite sex?	I strongly believe that sometimes when a person is in a relationship that actually makes them seem more attractive to the opposite sex. This is because that person is officially unavailable and to some people they get a thrill, excitement and a drive from trying to take someone else's partner. They like the thought of sneaking around, being adventurous, without a full commitment. What are your thoughts on this?

He was very very sorry, and realizes he has to treat you better, and said mistakes have made him realize, he has then allowed you to keep tabs on his internet history and stuff, and he will do anything to make you feel better, but you scared...., he thought it was not much different then porn. It still hurtful for you tho, You know he was talking some one dirty to this people. What do you do?? It's hard to get over. is it worth working out? Do you think a man can really have a realization that he truly made a mistake and he needs to treat you better?

I'm 20 and my ex is 23 we broke up 3 days ago. he was my first love and it broke my heart when we broke up. next month will be our 1 year anniversary. we had some great times and some memorable moments, I recently caught him texting another chick and chatting her up, he said that he was single and that she made him happy and he can't wait to meet up with her all in the one day.(they haven't meet face2face) so i asked him if we could take a break not only coz of her which really topped it off (as i was the other girl texting him pretending to be some one else) we spoke about taking a break and he said he wants to think about us. It Still hurts and he still TXT the other girl. But he hasnt rang me not once. i don't want him any more and i don't trust him at all.   But why dose he want he's cake and eat it to. Why does he still want me when he's got some one else.   (He doesn't know that i know about the other girl)

20080927160328AA0R4pS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, Your Girlfriend kisses your friend...What would you do?	Please I know this is long but it is important to me.      My girlfriend came home today and told me she shared a kiss with my friend. Not only is it my friend but also the boyfriend of her best friend.   We will call him Steve and my girlfriend we will call Becky. Beckey's best friend whom we'll call Alison just had a baby with Steve they also live together and are happy. Alison being best friends with my girlfriend asked my girlfriend to be the God Mother of their baby. Steve and I know each other through our mutual girlfriends being so close. He is not my regular aquaintence but we get along and often talk about going out to the bar scene together to party it up.   Anyway My girlfriend comes home to me and says that Steve kissed her. She admitted to kissing back then says that she realised what she was doing and pushed him away.   She tells me that it killed her and she needed to tell me. I said it was selfish of her to tell me because if I didn't know I would not be hurting right now. I am 26 now and have grown a little old to be dealing with this with fists towards Steve. I must wonder how much Steve respects me to do this with my girlfriend. Part of me wants to give Steve a one punch knock out. When I say that, I don't mean beat him down and stomp on him. I mean just one nice solid to the chin K.O and even help him up after and talk to him respectfully and let him know my reasons. Does this seem to immature? Should I instead talk to him and have him explain and apologise? I feel like less of a man right now and I need to get to the bottom of this.   My girlfriend doesn't want Steves girlfriend to find out from fear of their friendship deteriorating. She also doesn't want their relationship to fall apart because of the baby and all.   I know this might be a little confusing and really long but I would really apreciate some input from some non biased sources.   So Should I earn my respect and Knock him out or should I just talk to him?   Should my girlfriend talk to her best friend Allison and let her know and possibly ruin their friendship as well as the relationship she has with Steve? My whole philosophy is that my girlfriend should live with the guilt and not hurt her best friend with info that will tear her apart just so she can be guilt free.   I told my girlfriend that I would have rather not known. That it was selfish of her to tell me just so she wouldn't feel guilty.   Please help.    Thank you for your time and I look forward to your say.

20081001235200AA6Gw7m	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I cope with being a step-mother?	I have been with my partner for nearly 3 years and up until 2 months ago we only saw his children every other weekend for 3 - 4 days. Two months ago, they asked to come and live with us as they were not getting on with their mother (their youngest brother died in an accident last December whihc has been incredibly traumatic for all of us and they can't cope with the way their mother is grieving). We of course welcomed them with open arms but now, 2 months in, issues are starting to arise and I am struggling with the step mother role. My partner had a huge go at me last night because I apparently "snapped" at his son when he asked me to help him with something. I don't feel this is true and that my tone of voice was misinterpreted. I feel that the whole thing was blown out of proportion but I am now the ogre and the baddie for what I see as nothing and my partner shouldn't even have got involved. His son is 17 in 4 months so not a baby although he is incredibly immature. I am only 29 and feel that this whole situation has been forced upon me and no-one appreciates what I do and what I have given up for them. I gave up my job last year to accommodate my partners life (he runs his own business and was reducing his hours so that we could travel as and when we pleased) but that has now gone out the window because we now have his children. I can feel resentment building and when he treats me like another child rather than an adult it makes it even worse. HELP!!!

How can I approach this with him if it is all innocent - it was also about 2 months ago  - I went trhough his old phone as he has now got a new one. We have been together 2 and a half years, living together since last December and I have also just taken on the role of looking after his kids as they didnt want to live with thier mother anymore.

20081010152542AAzOMax	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Wife went from conservative to kinky? Should I be concerned?	My wife has always been shy and modest. As long as I have known her she covers up and dresses conservative. With in the last few months she walks around the house nude with the windows and blinds open. She even walked out of the bathroom nude when the UPS guy was in the foyer who she didnt know was coming. But instead of screaming, covering up and going back into the bathroom, she just casually walked thru the dining room and living room right up to us at the front door, exhused herself to pass between me and the UPS guy and casually walked up stairs to our room like no big deal. He saw ever single inch of her naked body for like a solid minute. ( and she shaves so he literaly saw EVERYTHING). I we both just watched her the whole time both out of shock. To my knowledge no one until now has seen her nude other than me and her doctor since we got married 7 years ago.   Not sure what to make of this sudden change. Just not sure what caused it and where it is going. Her explaination was that once she walked out and he saw her there was no point covering up at that point and he had already seen her and she might as well act like nothing happened and walk normal.    Should I be worried? Upset at her for doing that?

And its like every picture too. Maybe 50-60. She looks pretty in one particular angle, when she stands in that model pose. But other than that, I just don't get why she is putting up those pics.

We had some issues lately and the intimacy was the first thing to go.  There is so little physical contact anymore even though we both agree to try to save the marriage.        I feel like I have to beg for even the smallest amount of physical contact.  I told him he does not hug me back or he does not tell me he loves me back.  He does not want to have sex.  I feel like he just accepts love from me and does not give anything back.        He says he shows it in other ways by going to the store with me, playing games with me, taking care of house things for me.  I told him these things are great, and I appreciate them but I'm also asking for him to act like he is in love with me.  He said he thought he was.  He totally acts like he is shocked by my statements.  He said he thought everything was fine.        I am so frustrated because I feel like he does not ever understand anything I'm talking about.

My new boyfriend Charles *sobs and remembers ex* has asked me out on a date. But he has also mentioned bringing a buddy along, an Italian fellow, a Pino Chio or something like that.   Charles asked me to get my friend Nasby to come along, too...he believes that out of all of my friends, she is more his new friend's style, more what he is looking for in a woman. (she does magic tricks with bananas and blow-up thingies that always get the gents' tails a-wagging)       So, do you think that I should ask her?   I'm sure she'd be able to find a baby sitter and sneak out of the house after serving her hubby drinks all evening till he passes out, like she always does.      In your experience, are double dates any fun?

I live in a traditional style dorm room with one roommate. His girlfriend sleeps over almost every night and they always have sex once i fall asleep. Most of the time i do not wake up but when i do it is a very awkward situation. To add to it his bed squeaks and is banging against the wall and his dresser. When they are finished he always puts his used condoms in a glass jar above his bed and keeps them there. There have got to be 3 dozen in there. Another problem is that they both walk around naked when they are finished and they refuse to sleep with blankets. What should i do to make this awkward situation not so awkward anymore and not ruin my friendship with my roommate.

Here's what happened: My two friends were meeting up with the rest of us, a group of about 4-5 people. The two friends go to another school. We are all 15. So where we were hanging out my friends brother (whos mom is a big active PTA person and such) was there, who is a few years younger.  Then the two friends show up, and I didn't notice anything different...but then they pull out cigarettes that they were smoking? I panicked and just walked off with one of the guys i was hanging out with because one of the girls (i think she's a ***** cause she talks **** behind everyones back) was even purposely breathing right in my face. we didn't want my friends brother to think were apart of it, because he'd probably tell his mom. now theyre all pissed at US because we "ditched" them. we told them our reasons, but they're mad we didn't "tell them" to stop and theyre calling us "immature" for ditching them.      and it was broad daylight, and there's 15 year olds smoking, we live in a really quiet and goody two-shoes neighborhood.      sorry it's long, but please help. this other school is messing them up, it's some private school where all the kids are and are slackers. their parents probably won't care. one of the girls who was smoking was actually my best friend and i'm worried about her.

I cant agree with him now?
20081109043501AAvBoa1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Friendship date. Suggestion? ?	I have this great friend, she's smart, beautiful, caring, generous. She is the champion! We mutually know that we only want to stay as close friends and not become boyfriend/girlfriend. But I want to take her out for a nice evening, dinner then just chat under the night sky at a nice place. So it's like a "friendship date". Do you think it's a sweet idea? I want to get her a friendship rose too, but I forgot what colour rose indicates friendship! Also any other suggestions?

20081229194955AAv0OtI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Don't you find it strange that there are so many girls on here saying...?	...that they won't have sex before marriage. In real life, i know one girl who wants to wait until marriage. The rest are happy to go with the flow and see what happens or they have already had sex.       I think most of the girls on here are very young and love the idea of waiting until marriage because they have never experienced true love where you love and want someone so much, you just have to be together in that way. I'm a 19 year old virgin btw who used to think i'd wait, but i'm in love right now and i can so see myself making love to my b/f in the near future because it just feels right and it feels like the ultimate expression of love and oneness.       Don't get me wrong, not criticising anyone, their body, their choice. I just think it's unlikely that all the girls on here saying that they will wait, will actually wait when they find a guy they love and desire.    Has anyone else noticed this and thought the same (or differently)?   Thank you for answering.

20090127212939AAXlvb7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I've been thinking about swinging..?	One thing I do not like about my husband is he is very traditional about our marriage. He doesn't believe in having threesomes, swinging, being open sexually...I tried to do these things when we were just 'dating' but he thought he might ruin our relationship.

20090307104840AAKH1Bd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I can't get this off my mind!  Please help me!  I can't stand this!!?	So, the other day I was hanging out with the girl I like who had been flirting with me a lot the week before. She wasn't talking much and then after a little bit of talking she laughed at me for something and I jokingly called her a jerk. Then she said that I was the jerk and named all these things I've said/done to her.       I didn't realise it before, but everytime I teeze someone I sound like a jerk. Now it turns out that almost everyone hate's me because they think I'm a jerk, which I was never trying to be. I thought I was just joking around with them.      Now, since it seems like the girl I like doesn't like me any more, I'm dying to appologyse to her, but I won't see her for another few days.       In the mean time I have nothing to do at all and this is all I'm thinking about. How big of a jerk I am and how no one likes me. This sucks, I hate it. What should I do? I'm going to try to be nicer, but right now it's Saturday and I'm stuck with this on my mind and time is going by sooo slow... Please help me!

Don't most you gals played this game before marriage?      You go around "hooking up" then something snaps in your head forcing you to crave marriage.

20090307104555AAesWSu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If you were fighting for custody of your child, what are some of the things you would ask for?	Our son is wanting full custody of his 21 month old daughter. The mother has denied him to see her for no reason but just out of pure selfishness. There is rumors that the mom and her new live in lover are doing drugs. Our son has never missed a child support payment. Our son was never married to the mom. We have not been to court for anything. The only reason he has been paying child support is because we had a DNA test done through DHS and when it comes out your the father, they automatically set up child support. We have found out that the mother hasn't even established that she is the one with custody of the baby. The only thing that has been established is who the parents are. Our son continues to ask to see his daughter but the mom continues to say no. It doesn't make any sense why the mom went to letting our son see his daughter to not seeing her at all. I think one reason maybe that the mom suspects our son or us of reporting her to DHS all the time. In fact, she has said that DHS has told her to keep the baby away from her daddy. Well, we have contacted DHS to see if that was true. DHS told us in writing that they do not and cannot tell parents that and the only way the mom can keep the baby from the daddy is if a judge has order him to stay away. In which, that has not happen.   There is no abuse of any kind on our son part that would allow the mom to continue to say no. The mom will not work and she lets who ever she is living with at the time support her 2 children. When we did get to see the baby, the mom would bring her over for us to take to the doctor cause she didn't have time to do it. Our son has a full time job and has been in a steady relationship.    I just don't think it's fair that a mom doesn't have to work and let the government take care of her kids while the daddy works his butt off and does everything that he is suppose to do and the mom still won't let him see his daughter.    I need to know what all do we need to ask from the judge if we do not get full custody. We don't want to leave anything out.

20081113213035AAmgYVj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you ask a girl out?	I'm a 17 year old guy and i've fallen in love with my friend. I fell in love with her the second i saw her 2 years ago. She is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen and she's really smart. Whenever I see her I get weak at the knees & get butterflies in my stomach. She takes my breath away and whenever i see her i feel like i have to use all my strength to keep myself from kissing her. I lose all rational thought when I see her. We're in stats class together and i can't keep my eyes off of her. I've tried to ask her out but i freeze up every time. I've tried to ask her out everyday for the last 2 years. I've even tried doing it over the phone but I just freeze up when I try to ask her. She would be the perfect girlfriend/wife. I love everything about her & when ever i see her i always get lost in her eyes. I think she might like me but i'm not sure she keeps telling me that i'm really smart and sometimes she teases me and she just asked me if i would come to her soccer games. I really want to be with her. I would b a good bf. I would adore her and shower her with kisses all the time. Her kiss has to be like heaven. I've fallen in love with her and I want to marry her. Meeting her was the best thing that has ever happened to me. I think about her day & night and not being able to ask her out is driving me crazy. I know that she is my true love I just know it. It's just so hard to ask her out and I need to know how. How do you ask a girl out?

I'm in high school and she is too but she's around 19 going on 20 years old. Her parents kicked her out of the house and she doesn't have any stable relatives to live with. She's barely graduating and she doesn't plan to go to college. I hadn't had a conversation with her in awhile but, I went to our high school's SADD meeting and she was there and afterwords my mom drove her up to the mall to get her cell phone fixed and she told us what has been going on with herself. My mom would offer her to stay with us but, that's a temporary fix and won't help her out of the path she's going down. We're in Ohio and she's in a shelter in Cleveland and she has to take 3 buses to get to our school. Is there a way we can try to find housing for her closer? And what programs are there that can help her out? Is there anything we can do to try to get her a stable job? She's not in any vocational programs at our school either. Please feel free to ask questions. And thank you for any help you can offer.

He always told me i was beautiful though. Now im in high school, people from my past who I hadn't seen in a few years, approach me and tell me how good i look and those type things. I want to boost my self esteem, but nothing ever seems to work. I alays feel ugly. I keep my head down at school usually. and walk in opposite directions of other girls who I feel are prettier then me.

Okay me and my yougest brother travel the 1 and a half hour journey to my mums house every friday after a long day of school my other brother lives with my mum permenantly Im 15 and my younger bro is 10. It seems like everytime we go there all my mum wants to do is NAGGG! which is really annoying me. First of all theres school work well i no she only wants to help but she already knows im a independent learner i dont like constant tuition i prefer to learn on my own at home than with others at home because i learn more.       Then theres the constant annoyance about cleaning the house we are supposed to be guests because were not there on the weekdays but no everyday its clean the house we didnt even mess it up in the first place. Then after that its go shopping, she gives us this arm length list of things to buy we have like 15 shopping bags to hold between me and my younger bro. And the funny thing is whenever she barks her orders it only concerns me and my younger bro not the 1 who lives there permenantly! Then theres cooking she expects us to cook for her and ourselves day and night its annoying i no we should cook but  not all the time as a mother she should cook for us sometimes right!      Then theres shes always right when i say why do i have to go shopping all the time she shouts. Then when i say why doesnt the person who lives there permantly come shopping she says dont question me! She uses my laptop to blackmail me shes constantly threating to convascate it and not give it back if i dont follow her orders.      I love my mum but i feel like she driving me and my bro away weve now become reluctant to visit her. What can i do about this situation?
20090307110323AATvbng	Family & Relationships;Family	Am i missing the point my mum is really angry at ME and said i betrayed her trust for a stupid reason?	Okay so i travel to my mums house on the weekends with me i carry my laptop so i can do work and go on the internet etc. Only my laptop broke down and stopped working so i phoned the manufacturer DELL and they troubleshooted my laptop to see whats wrong with it and to see if they needed to collect it.       Well they did and my mum said i should pick which ever house i want to pick out of my mums and my dads house for them to collect it. At first i chose my mums house, but after a couple of hours i realized that when they deliver it back after fixing it ill will be at my dads. So i phoned them up again and said can i change the collection location and they said yes so i changed it!      When my mum found out she had a hissy fit she went crazy over such a small situation she was ranting and raving and telling my sister how much of a bad child i am  after doing this. I explained to her that i changed the location because i thought because she goes to work when they deliver it she will not be in whereas my dad said he doesn't have work that day and will be in on the day of the delivery. She said i dont get it and that i betrayed her and am a selfish child this went of for hours. Then she confiscated my laptop and said its mine you cant have it anymore. I was just confused about how this came about she's had it for like 2 weeks now and is still refusing to give it back to me!!!!      Why would she do this and am i in the wrong because i dont see how my actions could warrant such a inraged outburst!!!
20090307103421AAEiBM3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If he says he loves me, does that mean he means it?	I've heard that even if he only means it just for that moment, if it came from his mouth, he meant it. Is it true?
20090307103432AAiCckW	Family & Relationships;Friends	I am so worried and confused! Please help?	This is hard for me to explain. I never used to talk to anyone, I was shy and a loner. BUT that has all changed now, I am a completely different person now and I can talk to anyone. My problem used to be that I didn't fit in in school and weekends, but that is slowly improving as time goes on. (but I still worry about not being like everyone else)Sometimes I don't fit in which causes me to lose all my confidence but at other times things are great and I feel part of the group. What I am getting confused about is WHO to talk to, WHEN to talk to them and WHAT TO SAY. An example of this is in some lessons in school I am not familiar with the people I sit next to so I don't say anything. I look around and see everyone else talking and I worry that I am the odd one out. Another example is at lunch I usually have to go up to someone if I want to talk to them rather than viceversa. I worry about what to say to who and when. I rely on my two best friends too much but I have now realized that they're not very good friends and I want to get away from them as much as possible. One final example, yesterday I went on a school trip by coach (It went ok by the way) I was sat next to my best friend (Nick) infront was the Girl I fancy. At one point in the trip Nick said her name in a really low and peodafilioac vioce to get her attention. I would have done that except for the fact that I would have expected her to think it was really weird and not take it as a joke.       I worry about this everyday. I start collage soon which is a chance to start over because everyone new that I come across will have a completely open mind. A good first inpresstion is vital to be like everyone else. I am afraid that I will c*ck it up. I have changed so much but I am capable of being so much more. Please help.
20081113222409AA4a0St	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys... Please give me your opinions on this...thanks! ?	Okay, so does it annoy you when a girl constantly talks about herself.. (in a negative way)    like: Omg, my hair looks terrible, I'm so fat.. my make-up is running.. look at my hips, they are huge..stuff like that..      Does it bug you, and you just feel like killing her, or do you put up with it, and look past that, if your say.. her boyfriend, guy friend..have a crush on her..etc...?      Thanks,    just curious! (oh and btw, I don't do that! :P)

Is this a hint? I mean, she a good looking girl and all, and I'm sure I'd be happy with her, but she just went through a break up, and I've never really thought of her that way...

We have been through hell together even though we have only been talking for 3 weeks. we have this bizarre connection its like he knows me inside and out and his known me since I was 12      we both feel like we have known   each other for so long. We have talked about marriage and having kids but we know that we have to take it slow and where both happy about that.

20081116111438AAtO6mF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do I do now with my husband?	Okay, this is hard to say.  I love my husband.  Very much in fact.  He's a hard worker, loyal, great father to our 2 year old son, and he's always there for me.  He has no flaws, but he's very - how do I say - dry?  He's got a great sense of humor, and will do what I ask of him, but there's no desire there, no drive, no passion.  It's hard for me cuz I feel like I'm getting in this monotonous whirlwind of same ol same ol.  It just seems we're in a rut.  It's not sex.  Sex is great, always has been.  It's more the sensuality is gone.  The hot desires for each other is gone, which I expected to a point, but I never ladies expected to have to almost beg him to rub my shoulders and kiss my neck you know......The tv has become more important, and his laziness has taken over, and I feel lost.  I don't wanna make him sound bad, because he's a fantastic man - just lazy.  Too lazy.  Lazy to the point I feel like I'm gonna pull my damn hair out.  I've told him this many times.  I've told him that I feel even lonely sometimes.  He feels bad, but he has no idea how to naturally do what I want without him feeling uncomfortable.  I'm not asking for anything sick or demented - just some feeling.  please please please help.  I can't stay in this monontonous life forever and not do something stupid out of pure desperation forever.  This scares me.

I'm not object to anything after '89 - or long term relationship stories. Please keep this to adult relationship stories only, I know how 14 year olds meet. My husband and I met when we were 16 and had german class together, and so on and so forth, but I was wondering how relationships went before I was born. I know my parents story, and that's about it.

20090307050726AAYyfK2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I just found out the guy i have been dating is my cousin, what do i do?	Ok.. so we haven't officially been dating, but we have been hanging out together and telling people we're just friends.. but really with benefits if you know what i mean.   The other day he picked me up from my house for a date and when i went outside he was talking to my dad. Thats when the penny dropped and dad introduced me to my cousin.   We both just stared at each other really shocked. I explained to my dad that we were friends from uni and we were on our way to a lecture so he let us go.   In the car it was really awkward and i think that we both were really disgusted. We had dinner and discovered how we were related.   My dad has 12 brothers and sisters who sort of took different paths once leaving home.. so i didnt really get to know my extended family. My cousin let's call him.. Mark.. is the son of my fathers sister. He took his fathers last name. So it wasn't obvious that we were related.. we don't even look similar.   I guess i would like to know if anyone else has been in this situation. I don't think i am a weirdo and i do realise that this is wrong. However, I have never felt such an instant connection with someone before.. he is so gentle and kind. My heart wants him, but my logic and reasoning tell me that we should never talk to each other again.

Ok, my family recently made friends with this other family my dad works with and they were over at there house twice before I was over there..anyways, when i finally was available so i could go over there, i found there son quite amazing :) he was really nice and floored me with manners, door openings, help with my jacket, and he did everything he could, without being immaturely ridiculous, to make me smile/laugh. i have only seen his dad recently because he was at work with my dad, but it's been nearly a month since i last saw him, mostly because i lost my grandma. other than what the adults say about me and him and how everybody at my dad's work and that knows us thinks were perfect, i think i might i have a sorta kinda crush..do you think it's reasonable this early? should I wait to get all head over heels? do you think he likes me? he is 16 and i am 13 3/4.. is age a problem? please tell me what you think?

Hi,      I'm seventeen years old, and y parents recently got divorced. My Mom, and I use to be very close - but now, she goes off periodically, and she had bad mood swings (in terms that she can be all nice, but then she can be so bitter, rude, jealous, disrespectful, and cruel). It's very hard to take because she's envious of my life, and the fact that I have a great Boyfriend. She has no one (no friends, she doesn't work, and she only has one male friend who I believe is using her for money, and sexual things). I use to never et along with my Dad because he never understood my creative side, and my art. But now, somehow we are somewhat getting along.       I can't take my mother anymore, and I need a break! My Dad is willing to let me live with him, and all. My question to you is; am I making the right choice by living with my Dad? Can I live with him considering that my Mom has full custody of me? Can my Mom stop me? PLEASE HELP ME.

I trust him (to some extent) I love him (I hope) and I see him everyday. However, despite knowing him so well, and him knowing me, we don't always get along. I get mad, and so does he, and we fight. Being young, I always won. Although, I look at recent stories of abuse and everything, and I feel ashamed, because I think I may be abusive to my little brother. When I think of all I've done to him, I realize that if someone else did the same things, I would have beaten them senseless. I don't want to be abusive to him, or anyone, whatsoever. My question is, how do I stop hurting him, and myself, and fix my past mistakes?

20090307110203AAGyKlP	Family & Relationships;Friends	I hate my ex-bff and I have a really hard time around her?	we used to be very close at one point of time until she started showing her true colors. well, i know she's a btch but still i don't know why i miss her.. but just looking at that face for once makes me very very angry and i feel like making her suffer a lot and make her realize that she's wrong and should apologize, and i even want to beat her up(well that's not possible at all coonsidering the size). and i want everyone to hate her. all of this is immature and i know its wrong(and sadly never gonna happen, even if it will i would want to help her then). i don't know how to deal with this kind of stuff. i'm even not sure about what i want. i am so confused right now.
20090307104028AAtJUwK	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this a real friend?	I've never had a ton of friends; I much prefer a smaller group of friends. At this moment, however, I'm wondering if I have any friends at all.      I have this one (straight) friend, and we've known each other for around 4 years or so. I came out to him 4-5 months ago, he was ok with it. Before I came out to him, I would always discuss with him whatever relationship type issues he'd have, be it a girl he liked, or problems he was having with a certain girl. Well anyway, one day, long after I came out to him, I mentioned how I was seeing an ex of mine on a much-more-than-desired basis. That was it. I didn't mention anything more than that. Of course I said I didn't want to see the guy anymore and that I didn't really want to say hi, even though I felt I should. That conversation with him (over AIM), ended with him telling me it was awkward and that we shouldn't talk about relationships anymore.      I didn't say it at the time, but I was, and still am very hurt by it. I mean, it's not like I started spouting out sexual details. I was just mentioning this important part of what was going on with me. We go out with other friends and guess what's talked about? You got it, his girl problems/issues/etc. Was I wrong in expecting someone who I figured was a true friend to at least listen to the said problem without telling me what he did? I mean, it sucks for me, because I'm going through something right now, and really wish I had that friend to talk with about it (it's actually kinda funny, not pouty/omg emo), but it does deal in relationships.      So I guess what I'm basically asking is, what should I do? I'm obviously very hurt by this, and it's been bugging me since it happened. I just unfortunately feel like I've pulled the short stick in choosing my short-list of friends, or in this case, friend.

20081112054309AATd6WH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do people realize that research in the last six years shows that females commit more domestic violence?	For the past six to ten years, evidence has shown that females use more violence in the household against men than men use against women... the paradox is that less men report violence against them.      And sometimes simaltaneous violence meaning she hit first he hit second is ruled against the male for hitting back... the police rule of thumb is .... you're strong enough to walk away.      Thus, many woman base their current beliefs about society upon males striking females when it is exactly the other way around, more females hit males in relationships.      I have three personal examples... my mother broke my dad's nose in front of me(he didn't press charges).... my ex-girlfriend stabbed me in the leg with a fork --- it sunk in one inch and hung there (i didn't press charges) ... the same ex-girlfriend threw a picture frame at me, which broke and sliced my leg open six inches, (again I didn't press charges)      But I don't know of any personal stories of men hitting women.

I should have said this in person,but i know it would be really awkward to hear these words from a stranger and better decide against it and even if i have met you in person i just cant say these things to you and i donno how to start.   I should thank you for the following things:   it showed me to what extent i can love a girl and the joy of being in love and at the same time curse you for:   being so beautiful,for giving me sleepless nights.   Whenever u read this just leave me a reply by mail if u respect my feelings.Thats all i can say and wish all ur dreams come true.I know its time to concentrate on my career and so am moving on but not without your thoughts.   So, this is goodbye. I will miss you , just as I have in every moment in the last 3 years that I have been away from you and I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone but though you're still with me"      Should i try to find who this guy is?

I am a rather shy teenager, and I suffer from emptiness ever since 2 years ago, where I found so many people, finding love. And Then, there's me. I stand in a life where I am bullied every day, for no apparent reason. Thus causing me to be sahy when it comes to making new friends.      I have quite a bit of friends, but whenever I find a happy couple, or I get bullied, I suppress my sorrow and anger. Now, I really don't plan on getting my bulliers back for what they did. In fact, I really don't care what they do. I just ignore them..but it still causes anger.      I can't find anyone. Anyone I just try to be nice to, they treat me with extreme rudeness. Now, I suffer emptiness when it's not even my fault...or is it?       P.S. All of this also seems to really take a toll on my self-esteem.

20090307060153AAyM2m7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend help? I'm not sure about this anymore.?	Alright, so i've known this guy since kindergarten when we were 5 or 6. Well I told him I liked him a few days ago, and he said he liked me since the fourth grade, and asked me out. I said yes. Well now he's way to clingy. He tells me he loves me but I don't feel "that" kind of way towards him...It's only been two days that we've been considered boyfriend, girlfriend. I'm already going insane though. This is also my first boyfriend.       Plus to make matters all worse, he calls everday at least twice, it's making my parents angry. And he keeps asking me to go to his house (right down the street from where I live) but I can't go places alone with boys until i'm 16, parents rules. Although I can't go places with boys they did say I could have boyfriends. And no i'm not planning on "giving" myself away to him like that either...(you know what I mean..) I'm only 13!!! Plus that kind of things is best to save for marrige (my opinion you don't have to agree).       But I have no idea what to do, he's nice and all. Cares about me, kind of protective, and likes me for who I am and not what I look like...But it's just all so weird for me because i've spent 8 years just being friends with him and now i'm his girlfriend. All my friends keep saying just give it time, and if things don't work out then break up with him. But you see he has terrible mood swings too. I hate them. Also, he keeps calling me sweetheart, but it's just so awkward and weird. I"m not used to this.       Now i'm really starting to think i'm way too young and i've just gotten myself into a big huge mess of issues. What on earth do I do? Break up with him because it's too weird for me? I don't want to hurt him though... I just don't want to date anymore it's really awkward for me.      help!

20090307094844AAftK0E	Family & Relationships;Friends	Everybody has this bad stereotype of me.How do I fix it?	Hi Guys,            So, I am 15 yrs old, a sophomore in high school and all my life but especially in high school everyone has always called me quiet, shy, doesn't talk much. But what annoys me the most is that I feel the opposite, I feel like im always striking up conversation and everything, but I guess no one else sees it and I am sick of it! I feel like what do I need to do, SCREAM when I talk? I mean I don't yell, talk about other people/teachers, and I am VERY self-counciouss but does that mean that I am quiet? I'm just tired of it, and I want to change, and now that everybody is always saying that, everyone is getting the idea that I am and aren't hanging out with me anymore :(          What should I do?   Thanks.
20090307103029AAUsdjU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I marry without love because I love baby daughter, if no marriage I loose contact, different countries?	I have a beautiful 2yr daughter, I am 50, mother 28. We are in Poland, mothers home, but I really dont like it here, dismal and difficult place. I am from California, and want to live there, its so much nicer. Mother prefers her country, but is willing to go for a year to CA. We have to marry to make that possible, 6 months is max without marriage and immigration, also to make work legal. Mother and I are very different personalities, but we do well at times too. She does not know how to drive, or even ride a bike, and has debts id need to cover. Differences from age, culture, and male/female views, lots of differences. Also 2 years ago she cheated secretly for months with a friend of mine, stole money a few times, and lied countnuously about many things, even when the lies were obvious. Since the child came she seems more dependable, claims she learned from mistakes, but I set a trap and caught her stealing again from me, then she lied more about that. I dont want to stay in Poland, but my child is the best thing that I have in life. Is like to find someone I can really love, but at my age it is late, plus leaving the relationship means becoming just a visitor to my child, even worse if mother stays in Poland and I in CA. I waited so long to marry, but now it would be with someone I dont trust much, looking again means lonliness and maybe not finding as I age.Anybody with any experience in similar situations? Please help, wedding is soon, yet we argue more each day. Neither of us feels sure about this, but I want to be a real dad, and feel lonely otherwise.

My former best friends have been excluding me lately. Friend one was my best friend in 3rd-6th grade and friend 2 was my best friend starting in 6th grade. But then in 7th grade they both met each other and became best friends, excluding me. Like they would go to six flags and friend two invited friend one to her summer birthday party when i wasn't invited! But friend one invited me to her birthday party. I just don't know if i should invite them to my party because they have been excluding me and I have met some true friends lately. I don't want to exclude them, but they exclude me and i only have a limit of 10 people coming to my birthday and I have to make the guest list a little shorter. Just to say friend one and friend two and me are friends still but not best friends like we formally were. So should I invite friend one and friend two to my birthday party? And i can't invite one and not the other because they will obviously tell the other friend and i don't want to start drama and they go everywhere together. Please yahoo community help me please...
20090307105454AAbwPX1	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I am in a divorce proceedings with my husband and he is unfit for custody. He also owes back child support.?	My husband left our family and home when I was four months pregnant. Before he left he for my daughter's entire existence was scarcely available. This is why I began a calendar journal of when he called and cooperated and took our daughter for visits. The visits grew more seldom by his choice. I called everyday at times. There also have been incidents involving my daughter being injured because my husband was not watching her. He wasn't paying child support which I filed for in Sep and was NOT helping pay any home expenses and took our car and would not share at all. My daughter and I had no transportation and he did not pay for food or anything. His visits dwindled down to a few times a month. My daughter was affected VERY much by this It was very sad and hard. Can I get back support when I go to divorce court in June? Can I get his butt for abandonment? Very frustrated in wi!

When I saw him today he was in tears...saying that he doesnt like how he has taken his life problems on me...and that he is suffering from depression. He said that he has booked an appointment with a doctor...and wants to try with me again....         I told him that I cant say that I love him anymore...but I felt really bad for him...from what I saw he is really depressed. He is not a bad person...but is honestly depressed....and I couldnt just tell him to ef OFF...I told him we can start off as friends...and he has agree to it...I dont know what else to do....         Please tell me what would you do...what is the best way to break up?? and also there is someone that I have been friends with for a long time...nothing has happened b/w us...but there is the chemistry...however I dont want to 'cheat' on my current bf .........       whats the best way to handle this?????

20090307111729AAcoICu	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do I do about him?	So there is this kid I really, really, really like. We've hung out a few times & sometimes I text him. But not too much because I dont want to become annoying or anything. Anyways, I was talking to my best friend online & she told me that he added her on facebook. Later on that day she was over my house & I was texting him. She wanted to know why he added her, because they have never met or talked ever, so I ask him. He tells me that he added her because he thinks shes really hot. Now I feel like a complete idiot for being so crazy over someone who doesn't think I am as pretty as my friend. What should I do? Does this mean i have NO chance with him ever?
20090307111705AATHrM3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm actually confused about things. reply please.?	I think i'm bi,   i am 17 and i go to college.    i recently broke up with my boyfriend because of how much stuff was going on, but i think i still like him. when i was with him it didnt feel right but it felt nice, its like i like him alot but i dont fully love him. he is an awesome guy but he is kind of like a best mate? when we broke up he said he would wait for me, it made me feel bad. but i think i love my best girl mate i know it seems wrong but tell me if i'm wrong.   we had this agurement like back in october and i said she should just leave me alone and she said i cant do that because i love you, but bye then. At that time i wasnt really bothered because i didnt think i was bi i knew i was straight because i was still dating my ex. but whenever i'm with her she will always give me a hug and a kiss on the cheek and when were sitting down she will say my name then lean on me and hug me. she smells amazing too. she always seems to look at me and i can tell by the corner of my eye. when were in class she will look at me for a long time then smile at me. sometimes she'd wink and say hello you, and kiss me on the cheek. she always holds my hand and stuff, we've had like 5 agurements and i always say we cant be friends then she'd end up begging but at first she always agrees.   i'm confused about who i like,   help please ?
20060615090010AAJBfgx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Who should I believe?	There's this guy who I know nothing about, his friends told me he likes me and asked for my phone number. My best friend also likes this guy although she said she doesn't like him anymore. She told me that one of his friends told her he doesn't really like me and that he probably wouldn't call...but he did.       Now I'm confused, did my best friend lie to me or the guy just called coz his friends persuaded him to?

20090307111259AALVHhs	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I prevent my boyfriend and I from arguing?	We been together for about 6 months and we been arguing to the point were we wont even look at each other. We both say no more arguing ever but we keep arguing any way. I don't want our relationship to end at all because we cant stop fighting. Im done with the mess and love isn't like this.
20090307111101AAWyJmi	Family & Relationships;Friends	Please help me figure out if my friend is lying to me?	Well when my & my ex boyfriend still had a "thing" for each other (and promised not to like/flirt with anyone else...we couldnt be together at the time, long story) there was this other girl who liked him & her and her best friend hated me.  Well recently my ex got a new g/f and basically said he's moved on.  Well the other girl's best friend and me became really good friends, and she said she's sorry for being wrong about me at first.  So lately she's been telling me about how he told her he liked her during that time and wrote her this note all about how he liked, maybe even loved her (said she lost it) then she came to school the next day and said she found it and gave it to me saying "Yeah, here it is, you can read it so you know i'm not lying."   Well, it looked like his handwriting.  He got confronted and said that's a bunch of bull crap, and he doesn't seem to concerned about it anyway since he has a new g/f.   How do I know if this girl is lying to me?
20090307111625AADlAM2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Cute girl's reaction in my class?	So I've always kind of admired her from afar. I don't believe she's ever noticed me looking at her or anything, so she probably has no idea I like her. Recently, however, I think she's been checking me out more. Sometimes when she's turning her head, I catch at the glimpse of my eye that she stops for a little bit and looks at me, then continues turning her head.      Well during class, I went to go drop something off in another classroom. When I came back, I caught at the glimpse of my eye (again, without eye contact) that when she saw me enter the room, she quickly turned her head the opposite direction. What could this mean? Is that like... instinct, or am I reading too much into this? Note that I've never talked to her before... I just find her attractive.

Within these few months, a western 50yr-old man met my friend's wife and started to go out together and stayed overnight together, also they sent sms and emails to each other saying very sweet words. Finally the wife moved out and  they divorced. Poor the little boy has no mother and the western man is a bad guy who knew that young lady has a family and he still breaks up her family. And later my friend found that this man actually has a few other women at the same time. My friend was very angry with that bad guy and really wanted to taech him a lesson. What should I tell him to do?

20060610163244AA8MkZm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I bi-sexual? Or is this normal?	I am 21 and have always had serious relationships with men. Since my early teens I have been attracted to other girls, but just in a sense where I "check them out". I have noticed that I like to look at others chests and legs, really nice legs are good to look at for me. I have never been emotionally attracted to others, or have ever cared for a relationship with one. I have thought about trying "adultfriendfinder" for another girl that I am attracted to and see if we have anything in common, or if I can get that feeling where I like to be around them. I do have a boyfriend of 2 years, but no one else knows.       What is your suggestion on this? Or is this normal in a weird Freudian way?
