I don't vote for anyone based on party affiliation or skin color, gender or anything else...I vote for their ideas!      I did vote for Obama because I believe our country needed a fresh new approach to problems and I had a problem with our general direction the country was heading and I still have those same concerns.      However......         I do not believe that adding this massive debt on the shoulders of us and our children is right...it was wrong when the republicans added their debt as well.      Rather than looking outside (loans) why don't we first look inward and fix what is wrong first THEN refinace or borrow. It's like filling a swimming pool over & over when the real problem is a giant hole in the bottom.         those are my thoughts         any questions and I'll answer right back...............

20090227104221AAM2zO9	Politics & Government;Elections	Why does Ken Dunkin, House Rep. from Chicago want a million $ insurance policy required of all gun owners?	Representative Kenneth Dunkin (D-Chicago Illinois) is proposing legislation that would require gun owners in his state to carry a million-dollar insurance policy to cover "negligent or willful acts" involving firearms owned by the individual. The legislation would also make the gun owner liable for any gun crimes committed if the firearm was stolen and not reported.       In the legislation, police would also have the right to confiscate guns if the owner could not provide proof of insurance.      Is Chicago (obama's town) trying to do this as a step toward eliminating the "right" to carry guns in all practical senses?        http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illino...

I don't know who to ask and whoever I have asked have given me various answers BUT all I want to know is when I will get Senior Airman.  It's 36 months time in service/20 months in grade (whichever comes first) or 28 months time in grade.  I want to make sure that my time in grade started from Jan 4, 2007 NOT from Feb 16, 2007...

20090309185754AABMIkD	Politics & Government;Politics	Former CNN correspondent running for Pres. of El Salvador on Communist Party ticket, are you surprised?	 http://newsbusters.org/node/28644/print       After a 12-year civil war and a peace undermined by soaring crime, leftists in El Salvador are on the verge of completing a remarkable journey from armed struggle to the presidential palace.      Their candidate is a veteran TV broadcaster and morning talk show host, Mauricio Funes [4], whose Facebook page [5] lists his political views as “other.” Funes, 49, a former correspondent for CNN en Espa?ol, was recently recruited by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), the revolutionary group-turned-mainstream political party that is favored by polls to win the presidency in a vote scheduled for March 15....      Funes considers himself to be El Salvador's Barack Obama -- an agent of change in a country beset by the highest murder rate in Latin America and an economy in free fall.      The comparison is overt: Funes and the FMLN use images of Obama in their ads (despite objections by the U.S. State Department), saying both candidates were smeared by their opponents as allies of extremists. The FMLN television spots complete the link by employing the Obama slogan in English and Spanish, vowing "Yes, we can!"...

20090309192927AArlS7c	Politics & Government;Politics	If we found a Chinese Navy ship in performing surveillance off the coast of California, how would we respond?	Not that you'd hear it from the "liberal" corporate media, but it appears that the US spy ship in question was violating China's territorial waters:       http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/i...       And frankly, given the massive air and naval superiority of the US Seventh fleet in the Pacific, the idea that China just began harassing an American naval vessel without cause is absurd.      Perhaps China responded more aggressively than they otherwise would have due to the new Commander-in-Chief. It's also possible that the vessel was sent into Chinese waters for just such a reason - to let them know we still have our eye on them.      Most likely nothing will come of this, but it is interesting to watch the international military and diplomatic ballet.      Thoughts?

There's a study out that actually show that places where attitudes toward sex are more liberal AND where abortion is legal and contraceptives widely available abortion rates actually go down not up.      "A comprehensive global study of abortion has concluded that abortion rates are similar in countries where it is legal and those where it is not, suggesting that outlawing the procedure does little to deter women seeking it.      In Uganda, where abortion is illegal and sex education programs focus only on abstinence, the estimated abortion rate was 54 per 1,000 women in 2003, more than twice the rate in the United States, 21 per 1,000 in that year.       The lowest rate, 12 per 1,000, was in Western Europe, with legal abortion and widely available contraception"      What these numbers show is that outlawing abortion is not the right approach to make numbers go down. Sex education and contraceptives are.

20090309194420AAVBoZ0	Politics & Government;Immigration	Can you believe the temerity of these Americans immigrating to Mexico?	Some Mexicans fear threat to way of life with rapid growth of American residents      12:00 AM CST on Sunday, March 1, 2009      Alfredo Corchado       Not everyone is rolling out the welcome mat to Americans. Many Mexicans complain about the rapid growth of the American population in their neighborhoods, the threat they see to Mexican culture and language, and the possible drain on Mexico's inexpensive health care.      In San Miguel de Allende, the group Basta Ya is protesting the erosion of the language and the rising cost of living generated by the infusion of dollars into the local economy.      "They think Mexico, especially San Miguel de Allende, is an extension of their country," group member Arturo Morales Tirado said of the Americans who call San Miguel home. "It's not and won't be, no way."      Others are fuming over what they consider to be the privatization of beach land. Under Mexican law, beaches are federal land and are open to the public.      A group of women in Nayarit state routinely demonstrates against posh hotels, some of which assign armed guards to keep all but guests away.       "We're not against Americans," said Marielza Izurieta Valery, president of United Women for the Banderas Bay. "We're against big corporations, many of them from the United States, taking our beaches away."      Some Americans, aware of the potential problems, are making an effort to participate more fully in their adopted country.      In San Pancho, Nicole Swedlow, a 34-year-old transplant from California and single mother of two, began a nonprofit organization aimed at building ties between Americans and Mexicans, with donations coming mostly from U.S. retirees.       "The last thing I want to see is an extension of California deep into Mexico, where Mexicans are priced out of their own communities," Ms. Swedlow said. "It's our obligation to ensure that we build bridges, learn their language and celebrate their culture. We need to learn to coexist."      ****************   What is up with these cheeky Americans anyway? Are they going to want to rename a street in San Miguel de Allende after Davey Crockett next?

My Fiancee is currently in BCT for the Army National Guard here on Fort Jackson, and just finished Red Phase, and is set to Graduate on April 24.  Before she left for Basic Training, she had been having issues for months where her her hip/top of her right leg where it connects with her hip would lock up, then it would make this loud pop/thud noise, and she would sit there in pain for a couple of minutes.  Well, she injured her hip last week and has gotten the x-ray and from what I was told from my mom's friend who works at the hospital on base, it is mandatory that she gets a Bone Scan to determine if it is a Stress Fracture, and if so she may be discharged depending on the severity or she may have to go through a rehabilitation program to see if it will heal.  Is there a chance that they could possibly tell that this may have been caused due to her prior medical condition where her hip would lock up, or will they be able to tell or find any other conditions based on her x-rays and Bone Scan?  If so, what will happen?  If she is Medically Discharged, how long will the process take before she is released to come home?  After her Bone Scan, will her file automatically go in front of the Medical Board for review, or is that only if the Injury is Severe?

20090309222952AAMJDu5	Politics & Government;Politics	War On Drugs - Deadly Mexican Cartels Entering U.S: Is it time for drastic measures? Please read...?	Please See Videos       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNaBtXS9M...        http://cosmos.bcst.yahoo.com/up/player/p...       Chemical dependence is a miserable reality. The destruction of families and businesses, the violence and crimes committed by addicts to support their habits and, now, militant drug cartels - fueled exclusively by the staggering wealth provided by U.S. users - continues to grow.        The government has undertaken countless, costly measures to combat the problem and, though there has been *some* success, substance abuse counselors and even officers in the War on Drugs admit that the problem is only getting worse.      Is it time to take it to the next level? To fight the root causes and even do things many people (including myself) regard as abhorrent (I also consider war abhorrent, as do most who've fought in them)?       ____________      The Next Level   ____________      The cartels can be killed - very quickly -by killing their market...withOUT legalizing drugs.       How? ... Consider This:      1) We set up "zones" with special jurisdiction (such as we do for embassies of foreign countries). Each would likely be just a few acres.       2) Secure their perimeters. I'm talking triple, parallel, 15', tilt-up, concrete walls with large "puppies" and barbed wire between.       3) Train pharmaceutical specialists to administer pre-counted, pre-labeled doses of the crud.       4) Users would be granted "entry and use licenses" (E&U's) upon demonstrating a solid understanding of the dangers of each substance and waiving their rights to any tax-payer assistance for conditions resulting from the use of that specific substance.     - - 4.a.) Each E&U card would list the substances that that user has been approved for.       5) Users can enter, party all they want or till they go broke, and then?     - - - > They can NOT leave until they are determined clean and sober (by specific legal criteria).      Results?       A) Cartels go broke   B) Users need no longer break the law by using.    C) Doctors and researchers studying addiction and addictive tendencies will have a much clearer and honest picture of the addict   D) Addicts and scholars of addictive tendencies could work together to find cures for substance abuse; e.g. study-groups pick up the tab for all the doses each addict uses - addict signs a release form permitting this specific group to compile his/her data, habits, usage, one-on-one discussions, etc.    E) Addict-slums disappear.   F) Jails would nearly stand empty   G) Addicts would only be hopped up and wild while voluntarily seqestered from the rest of society.    H) Addiction would almost certainly fall.       Long story short, we'd all be better off. For a while, there'd still be some addicts lost to their addiction. But far fewer than now.       Your thoughts?       ...

20090309231947AAUgM2f	Politics & Government;Politics	So why doesn't he stop it?	The New York Times interviewed President Obama the other day and they asked him "whether his domestic policies suggested that he was a socialist, as some conservatives have implied."        His answer?      "The answer would be no," Obama said, after defending his administration for "making some very tough choices" on the budget.      Later, he called the journalist back because he was troubled about his answer.  He added the following:       "It wasn't under me that we started buying a bunch of shares of banks," Obama said. "And it wasn't on my watch that we passed a massive new entitlement, the prescription drug plan, without a source of funding."      So, he's essentially saying, "Bush started it."      He has a point.  Bush did initiate the bailing out of the banks and other industries.  However, my question is this:  if Obama seems to believe that government involvement in the free market is bad as he implies, why is he continuing to bail out companies and unions?  Why doesn't he just abandon that idea and let the market right itself, as it surely will?      Thoughts?      Cheers!

20090309210741AA1wRtn	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	I feel like they are harrassing me and singling me out?	I live in public housing, just me and my daughter.  My Mom lives with my aunt in the next city over, about 20 minutes away, and my boyfriend lives in the next state over.  I am not allowed to have anyone living here but me and my daughter and that is what we are doing.  Where my mom is living, there isn't a phone and they don't have cell phones either... so when my mom got loans she gave them my number and my address.  She has had her loans for about a year.  I don't know the details about her loans, but she hasn't been paying them because these people from the loan companies have called my phone over and over, it got so bad that they were calling every single day 2 or 3 times.  At first I would tell them... "If I see her, I will let her know."  Then it got to the point that it was just ridiculous and I told them they had the wrong number.  The didn't stop and when it started to get to be 2 to 3 time a day, them calling me, I started telling them to stop harrassing me and would hang the phone up on them.  Seriously, its wasting my money, my time, and stressing me out!        They sent a man down serving paper to her that she needed to go to court.  I told the man that I hadn't seen her in a while, and that she had went to Florida before Christmas (which she did).  He clearly told me that he didn't believe me and that he was going to have an officer with him next time he came.  So, a week later he came back with an officer.  He hid behind the wall of my house while she knocked on the door.  I asked her several times what she wanted but she insisted on coming in my home before she told me.  I let her in and that is when that man came around the corner and jumped in the door too.      My boyfriend was over with me at that time, when they came, and she asked me where my Mom was and I said either in Florida or the next city over.  She said "well then you don't mind me searching your house then, do you?"  I said sure, whatever, and she went searching (alone).  She came back and that man said "shes too fat to be the same person I saw last week", implying that it was my mom... not me, which is funny because my mother is well over 300 pounds... I'm not even close!      Then the cop lady asked me how long my boyfriend has been living with me.  I said "what the hell are you talking about? He doesn't live here".  She said that she sees his truck here all the time and I said well of course you are going to see his truck, he is my boyfriend!      Since then I have been getting eviction after eviction after eviction... over the least little thing.  I have lived here nearly 3 years and they have never treated me this way.  I went to the Housing Authority office to talk to them about my last eviction notice (I have been getting out of them because, obviously, they were full of crap to even send them to me).  She asked me 3 times during the meeting if my mom or boyfriend was living with me and kept threatening me that if she finds out she will kick me out of my home.      How is this fair?  I have done nothing wrong, and I feel I am being harrassed and treated unfairly by both the loan comapanies and the housing authority.  Now I have another eviction notice that I just got TODAY... but was dated FEB 13, 2009...  This eviction was  typed up BEFORE the eviction letter they sent me last time (which was typed up on Feb 16th).  This time it is for 'poor housekeeping' which is a joke.  I got a violation notice when they inspected, and they give you 2 days to fix the problem, then they come back after those 2 days to see if it is fixed.  THEY NEVER CAME BACK.  They did the same to the lady across the street from me and she is still fighting her eviction.  She, however, got her eviction letter the next day it was typed up.  Her house or my house either one was messy.  We have kids, and kids have toys in the floor and that was ALL that was wrong with my house and my neighbors house.  (She is the only neighbor I talk to, I don't know if there are any other similar cases.)      Is there anything I can do?
20090309210829AApjsdl	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	What is the name of this law, and am I right about it?	I hope I have the first part right, and the second part TOTALLY wrong...      The law says that if 40% of the community is white, 40% black, and 20% Indian, then all the schools and jobs have to have ratios of 40/40/20, regardless of skills. I have hears that it even affects religion so that if a community is 30% Christian, 30% Muslim. 30% atheists, and 10% pagan, then again the schools and jobs have to have ratios of 30/30/30/10.          This means that is a town is 50% black and 50% white, but all the blacks were home schooled or already out of school, then the whites could not be taught because the ratios would be wrong so the school would be breaking the law. This is how I heard it explained by a national legal organization.   The part that terrifies me is that if this is true, Muslim terrorist found a town with Muslims in it, they could move in, get a job in demolition, steal all the explosives they want, and still be guarantied job security, just because there had to be a percentage of Muslims working there, and no others want to, or it would be illegal. Am I wrong?

You have just been elected president of a prosperous country.      Months after your election, your country is attacked by French terrorists.  They quickly claim responsibility and the French government offers little to no response to deal with these terrorists, so it's up to you, as president, to decide the next action.      After carefully looking at the intelligence, it's clear that France was largely responsible, so you choose to go after France and also Iceland, a country that had little to no involvement in the attack and there is little to no evidence to suggest they did.  Your intelligence agency is unsure, at best, what connection Iceland had if any.      So you decide to fully invade Iceland...what the...???????      This clearly doesn't make sense.

I need advice in regards to whether I should report the local theater I work at to the local health department? Personally I believe their operations concerning the hot dogs are extremely unethical and violate health standards. My initial concern is in regards to any remaining hot dogs during closing are unwrapped and stored in the freezer over night for the next day. By the next day the hot dogs have turned brown from freezer burn and have shriveled up significantly and our managers expect us to sell them in that condition. Also the theater is infested with mice. What should I do?
20090309211126AAUiNOW	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	UN - Restriction of free speech regarding religion? Some questions..?	A friend of mine told me recently that the UN is hoping to restrict free speech against religions - and from my understanding - specifically Islam.       Does this video adequately cover the issue? What do you think of it personally? Would you mind losing that aspect of your right?     http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=d68_12356...       For those of us who don't agree with it, is there anything to be done?      In the video, one of the men points out that Islam makes a claim in saying it is the final word from God -- and that with this passed, no one can challenge the claim. This is totalitarianism.       Do you agree? Would it be totalitarianism? What does this UN act (so to speak) specifically say?       Please be mature with your answers. I'm not out to offend anyone, nor do I want anyone being offensive to others here. I'm just trying to get the full scope of this.

Tell me if this sounds like a good idea? They take the 410 billion and buy up the foreclosed mortgages and give people free houses. In turn, they go out and instead of paying mortgages now they start investing there money and spending it to go out to eat more. Most people's mortgage costs the majority of their expenses, and taking that away, plus making sure they all have a place to call home forever.

20090309215525AAdqIvg	Politics & Government;Government	Does Democracy Really work?	Democracy is a system of government where “the people” choose the leaders correct? “The people” are in charge of plugging in leaders who later make large scale decisions influencing the world right? Now I love that idea but only if it were so simple. Isn’t that a little bit to much pressure to put on "The people"? And just who are these people? What do these people do in their own privacy, how much do they know about government or politics?       Should Apes, and monkeys have the right to vote since the average American knows just as much as an Ape does about politics?      What if all the people in America were gangsters and pimps what kind of leaders would they choose? Are the people in a democracy well enough educated to make these big decisions?       The bottom line is there HAS to be more regulations on something so important as voting. Our votes lead to life and death, war, and peace. We can keep the name the same but we need to be sure that well educated folks, that know plenty of government and politics are voting. Their should be some requirements like taking a certain class that will cover many areas and an exam that fallows for example. All of this should be a requirement and for free so the poor and rich can vote.      Do we really want Joe Shmoe the wife beating alcoholic to vote?       Other wise we should legalize voting for apes because at least they are unbiased and don’t choose their leaders on the basis of skin color, or their “personality.” I know many people that vote every 4 years for personality since they lack political knowledge.      Less then 50% of american adults can niether read nor write in some areas     http://www.uis.unesco.org/en/stats/stati...

Or is there another procedure there?      And secondly, how does a refugee enter an embassy of a foreign country? Can they get in and make their claim as a refugee, or will they get stopped at the door?       I know China has been deporting North Korean refugees they catch trying to get inside embassies, but I thought Embassies were considered foreign soil?       If a Chinese police officer removes a North Korean from an embassy have they not just violated the sovereignty of that country?

20090309221208AAkbJFC	Politics & Government;Military	What is the best path to AMRY JAG Unit? ROTC vs. USMA?	My name is Michael Brinkley and I am currently a senior in High School and I have aspirations to one day be an Army Officer and work within the JAG unit. Recently, I have been accepted to the 5-year West Point program as well as received the National ROTC 4-year scholarship for UCLA, UNC, Illinois, and Stanford.       I am very interested to hear about personal experiences within the JAG unit as well as the road that officers have taken to become members of the JAG unit. Also, I was interested in the differences in the way ROTC officers are viewed as apposed to West Point graduates.  As I come to the deadline for college decisions here in the next few weeks, I feel that an opinion form a person who has already accomplished some of the things that I aspire to do would be a vital part of my decision making process. I appreciate your time for reading this letter and am very eager to hear your response and any other advice you are willing to give me. Thank you very much.
20090309221736AADR8Mn	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Is it legal to pay to watch someone masturbate.?	I work in a warehouse and as is typical when you get twenty bored wage slaves in a confined area the conversation usually turns stupid lol.  In any event a couple of people began to argue as to what exactly qualifies as "solicitation" since a coworker recently got arrested for it.  Towards that end I'm wondering whether Jake was right that paying to watch someone masturbate is legal (as this is the most plausible circumstance they came up with).  Incidentally we work in Montana.

20090309231428AAktN5l	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Tenants rights regarding cigarette smoke coming in through air vents?	We already signed a lease for an apartment that smells kind of smoky. We assumed that the smoke was from the previous occupant and the landlord said that he would take care of it before we moved in. However, today we got the keys and it totally smells like an ashtray. We just realized the smoke is coming in through the air vents from the downstairs neighbors (who smoke!)      We already signed the lease and paid the deposit before realizing that the smoke is coming from downstairs. The landlord said he will change the filter but I am skeptical.      I have a one year old son, and asthma which is triggered by my severe allergies. I am worried about exposing my son to the cigarette smoke. I have an air purifier which is wonderful, but I am scared that it won't be enough if the neighbors are continually smoking like that.      The lease is with an individual landlord, and there are no other units available.      We are in Ohio, I am not sure what the laws are here. Oh, and the landlord is a lawyer.

Just curious, we know as a fact that a few well connected business men took down our country and the world economy. Yet we still "can't" find Osama Bin Ladin nor has the FBI bothered to put 9/11 on his Most Wanted poster. But 7 of the alleged terrorist of 9/11 were found alive and not charged with any crime.      Do you think instead of lying and spending all of those Trillions on chasing imaginary terrorist would have been better spent on policing our financial markets.

So I look up the the contract that was sent to me from ATT and it states "See our complete policy at:   att.com/ReturnPolicy"    When I to to ATT website for the return policy it states exactly ' You may cancel service within 30 days from the activation date to avoid the early termination fee of $175. Thereafter the fee will decrease by $5 each month for the term of the agreement'  But says nothing about having to have purchased the phone after May '08 anywhere on the site.

20090309191042AApSSqK	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do the wealthy pay such a great share of taxes?	Could it be because they've stolen all of the economy's productivity gains for three decades now? And yes, it is theft: the marginal wage rate is theoretically supposed to match per-hour productivity. When it doesn't, someone is taking something that doesn't belong to them.      The question is thus: why do people, when told that the wealthy pay most of the taxes, focus on the totally irrelevant red herring - the distribution of the tax burden - and not on the distribution of income, which is the relevant factor?

This country has had this huge debt for the most of Bushes term, I am living the same, what cost went up?   The price of gas maybe, but that's down now, Obama Just gave me a federal tax decrease , my local state taxes are the same as Always, what exactly are you fearing?   besides Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh,  those people are just ranting because they will pay more taxes.  Think about it....  average americans don't earn enough money to pay that huge debt, that is why they are squealing and trying to convince us average americans that WE will pay.....  it is all BS

20090227143854AAgAoF0	Politics & Government;Politics	Do Republicans understand the effects of higher taxes on the top brackets?	I know that Michelle Malkin has all the Republicans convinced that they are tax and finance experts, but do any Republicans really understand what happens when taxes are raised on the top brackets?      For instance, during the 1950's the tax rates on the top income brackets were 90% and HIGHER. Do Republicans really think people gave 90% of their income to the government? Do they think the economy was weak in the 1950's? Don't the Republicans understand what the real alternatives would be?      Alternatives such as tax free municipal bonds. They help rebuild our infrastructure. Another alternative is investing business profits back into the business thereby avoiding the taxes. Another option is to pay your employees more. That's right, money paid out to employees isn't taxed against the employer's income.      So higher tax rates on the top brackets will result in needed investment in infrastructure, needed investment in business growth and expansion, and needed growth in real wages. All of which we had in during the 1950's.      Why do the Republicans oppose all that?
20090309235024AAVBlPs	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	What kind of Conservative am I?	I believe in minimal government intervention.   I THINK ABORTION IS MURDER   I do not believe in progressive taxation. Taxes are way to high because the government cannot manage money efficiently and waste it.   I believe America should be able to have a stronger military and a strong foreign policy. There is nothing wrong with the war in Iraq.    I see nothing wrong with driving hummers since I live in a wealthier area and think Capitalism leads to a higher quality of life overall.   I think welfare should be drastically reduced. People that are just lazy get it when they should get a job.   I believe the strongest families are those with a mom and dad and very traditional. I think mothers should stay home with their kids for a long time as my mom did and not work.   I think religion in schools is a good thing and we should not keep secularizing religion out of public institutions.   I believe the space race should be a privatized industry as NASA bleeds money and government does not make great discoveries, but the private sector does.   I think torture is okay in extreme circumstances when american lives are at stake   I support capital punishment and believe sentences should be much, much tougher   I don't care about whether gay marriage is legal or not   I am against condoms being handed out in schools and think    abstinence should remain being taught.

20090309235219AAeJ4kM	Politics & Government;Politics	Am I Liberal, Conservative, Republican or Democrat?	Here are my views:      1)  I am very against abortion, because it is the innocent killing of a human life.      2)  I am also very against gay marriage.  Marriage is between a man and a woman with the purpose to pro-create and keep life going.  If everyone marriage was same sex, then the world would cease to exist.      3)  I am against a universal health care.  It will greatly decrease the quality of health care.  I believe health care should be assesed by each individual state, not the federal government.      4)  I believe the pulling out of troops from Iraq, and placing them into Afghan is a mistake.  If we pull out now, all we will see is going to be terrorist and extremist groups pop up over there.  If you use the excuse "well are you okay with 4500+ US soldiers dying?" compare those numbers to the numbers dead in different wars...      5)  Raising taxes for the wealthy is ridiculous.  I believe most wealthy people worked hard for their money and went to college and paid attention and did well in school.  Public education and loans are available to every person.  Harworking people do not deserve to be forced to pay more money than the rest just because of a college education.      Just some input would be great.  Feel free to say whatever you please :)

20090309235036AArnJzh	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Should my Family sue Super Wal-Mart?	The reason for this discretion , was from verbal harassment, that occurred in a local wal-mart from a secret worker pretending to be a regular shopper.       Around eight p.m my mom, brother , and I were just about to leave wal-mart after purchasing house requirements . When we went out the exit room , this asian guy walked up on my brother quoting, " GIVE ME THE PACKAGE" , repeatedly. We didnt know what he was trying to say ,because we did not know about a "package" . He told my brother not to lie , and that he knows my brothers has the package. Of course to my defense i aggressively told him that we don't have what hes looking for and stop asking cause it will get him no where. All of the sudden this tall african man came up and started accusing my brother with the asian. My mom pulled us back into wal mart , so people can witness what is happening. I looked at the cashiers and the workers around practicially yelling for assistance. No one even bared to look. So, here are the guys rambling about the situation , not even telling us what or why is the package so important. They asked my brother to pull out the stuff in his pocket . My hypothesis , was that since my brother has an iphone and just bought a guitar hero card while we were in walmart ,that they wanted to steal it and some how run away. My mom asked if they worked here , they answered yes , but they werent wearing any uniform. Obviously , it must have been a lie. I tried getting on the muggers face and say to leave because he has nothing he's looking for , but he says this doesnt involve you, no need to shout, just leave this to him [ my brother]. I wouldnt damn leave it to my brother . We couldve been mugged, or worse someone couldve gotten hurt. The muggers ended it with," get out of here , we saw the package of pencils, was that so hard?" . [that was stupid].      When we arrived home , i called the police and told them the situation . They looked for the recorded tape of the men and later informed me that they are secret workers. My dad later calls wal-mart asking them to speal to the manager, the person hands it to the manager , and while my dad was saying how stupid the workers treated us that he wanted a reason . They said  ," well thats our workers , and thats their job". They also said to go to wal-mart tomorrow and talk to the manager later on. My dad replied that this isnt the manager he is speaking to that they lied about that also .      SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

20090310021454AAY0gtI	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can I defend myself in a Credit Card Collection Lawsuit vs Discover?	I am in a unique situation that will probably become more common with America's failing economy.  Two years ago I lost my job and have since been applying for jobs everywhere with no luck.  At first I had high hopes of getting a job so I stayed in the area.  I then realized I had to start selling off some of my personal items/property to pay bills.  After a year of this I have sold off everything that I own, I have absolutely no money, and still no job.  I do have 1 Discover credit card with a balance of 4000 dollars that I cannot pay off because I have no money and no job.      In an attempt to collect my debt Discover sent me to a 3rd party "Law firm attempting to collect the debt".  They sent me papers saying they were going to file a lawsuit against me and after judgement is passed they would do the following:   1.) Garnish my current wages   2.) Take any personal property that was purchased with the credit card   3.) Put a lein on any property that I own      Heres my situation.   1.) I have no job, no income, no money in the bank, nothing to garnish.   2.) The whole balance is a transfer from another credit card, and the items purchased on that other credit card are long gone; sold to pay whatever bills I could.   3.) I do not own any property, no vehicles, no lawnmowers, not even a computer.  I have NO personal property for them to put a lein on.      So my question is, what is going to happen if I lose the lawsuit?      Does anyone know what will happen when they realize I have absolutely nothing, not even 3 dollars in a savings account anywhere?  Can they pursue anything further than the 3 things they listed or will they just accept it as a loss and write it off?
20090310021715AAtH2zd	Politics & Government;Military	I want to attend a basic training graduation at Ft. Benning, anything I should know?	I want to attend my best friends basic training graduation at Fort Benning.  I'm so nervous even though its about two months away.  I believe the exact dates are May 7-8th.  I am planning on attending with his family.  I wanted to specifically know what kind of id they accept at the base if they even ask for one.  Do they ask just the driver for an id or the passengers too? Im a student, can I just use my student/college id because I don't have my drivers license yet? Or can I use my Canadian passport? I'm not sure how serious they are and I do not want any problems at the gate.  It would be nice if someone could walk me through that day/weekend that has attended a graduation recently.  I really want to go because I do not want to let him down.

20090310022649AAK1T7s	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can a repo person force their way into my garage?	The former tenant in my home was not too diligent in paying thier bills.  Recently collectors and specifically a repo company has been trying to force their way into my garage, and tell us by law we are required to show them.  This isn't my vehicle they are after, it isn't my debt, and has nothing to do with me.        I keep a home office in the garage and I don't want the repo company or the "representatives" they send out sizing up my garage, I have a great deal of expensive equipment in there, and who knows what these guys backgrounds are.      Recently they showed up at 1:30 in the morning banging on the door demanding to see inside the garage from my wife.  How can this type of harrasment be legal, and what are my rights?
20090310023355AAhMal9	Politics & Government;Politics	Why Is Education Not Free?	I mean higher learning and education on a college level. I understand that it is a service provided by the government and thus has to be paid for somehow but how can you Govern The People if they are not aware? We pay taxes, education should be free to those who seek to better the lives of their fellow man.
