In my lyrical class a few years ago, we used this African music for our warm up, and I really want to find the songs/cd name or something.  One of the songs goes: "The boat goes to the water, down, down, down, to the water, the boat goes to the water, the people don't care, standing in the middle of the boat goes to the water [etc...]"      And then another song started out with people speaking French very fast. And then later, it sounded like, 'Shen drakuku drakuku shen shen, shen drakuku drakuku"       I don't remember anything else, but 10 points for the first right answer!! I've been looking for these forever, so if you can just point me in the right direction, that would be great!

20081012154725AAZiQrZ	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Comic preference: Marvel vs. DC?	I'm not a die hard comic fan, but I have stuck to loving mostly DC Heros and dated a die hard DC fan. One of my close friends, however is a Marvel fan. This creates major arguments, but I don't really think theres anything distinguishing enough to call one out over the other.       Anyway: Name your loyalty and give a reason--hopefully a good reason--for your loyalty.

Llegan a una isla en la que sólo hay un cocotero y el espa?ol, que está que se muere por cepillarse a la inglesa, propone un plan:   --Vamos a turnarnos para subir al cocotero para ver si se acerca un barco. Subo yo primero.   Se sube y se pone a otear. De repente mira hacia abajo y grita:   --?Eeeh! ?Dejad de hacer el amor, que no estáis solos...!   Los ingleses, que sólo estaban hablando, se miran extra?ados y se dicen    --Este tío está loco o ve visiones    Al poco, el espa?ol grita otra vez:   --?Que os estéis quietos, que esto no es ni el momento ni el lugar!   --Este está delirando...   Al cabo de un tiempo se baja el espa?ol y se sube el inglés. El espa?ol, rápidamente, se empieza a ligar a la inglesa y a los cinco minutos ya están en la faena. El marido, que está en lo alto del árbol, mira hacia abajo y se dice:   - ?Joer, pues es verdad, desde aquí arriba sí que parece que estén enganchados!

20080713102854AA97vbp	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Connaissez  ce regime amaigrissant  efficace?	Nous savons qu'il faut 1 calorie pour élever la température d'1 gramme d'eau de 1 degré.   Traduit en termes compréhensibles, cela veut dire que si vous mangez un dessert très froid, (principalement composé d'eau, en général), le processus naturel qui élève le dessert consommé à la température du corps pendant le cycle digestif, br?le littéralement les calories provenant de la seule source disponible: la graisse de votre corps.   Par exemple, un dessert servi et mange a une température proche de 0°C sera très rapidement élevé à la température normale du corps (37°).   Pour chaque gramme de dessert mangé le processus consomme environ 37 calories, tel qu'indiqué plus haut. La portion moyenne de dessert est de 168 grammes.      Dès lors, suivant les lois de la thermodynamique, 6216 calories sont soustraites de la graisse de votre corps (1 cal./gm/deg. x 37 deg. x168 grs) pendant que la température du dessert est normalisée.   Déduction faite des 1 200 calories latentes présentes dans le dessert, la perte nette en calories est de 5 000.   A l'évidence, plus le dessert est froid, plus vous maigrirez vite, si c'est votre but.      Ce processus fonctionne également si vous buvez de la bière dans des verres refroidis. 30 cl de bière contiennent 16 calories latentes, mais déduisent 1,036 calories (6,216 cal. pour 180 ci.) pendant le processus de normalisation de la température.   Aussi, la perte nette en calories par portion de 30 grs de bière est de 1 020 calories.      Il ne faut pas être physicien atomique pour calculer que 12 240 calories (360grs x 1,020 cal./30grs.) sont soustraites du corps pendant qu'on ingurgite une canette de bière.   Les desserts congelés, c'est-à-dire la crème glacée, sont encore plus bénéfiques, puisqu'il faut 83 cal./gm pour les faire fondre (amener leur température a 0° degré et 37 cal./gm supplémentaires pour les élever à la température du corps.      Les résultats alors sont impressionnants.      Malheureusement pour ceux qui mangent des pizzas, la pizza (lourde en calories latentes, et servie à une température supérieure à celle du corps) produit un effet inverse.      Mais, heureusement, comme tout lecteur astucieux l'aura déjà compris, la solution évidente est de boire beaucoup de bière avec la pizza, puis de suivre immédiatement par de grosses portions de crème glacée.

Cierto joven so?aba con tener una Harley Davidson, así  que decidió ahorrar lo suficiente y fue a un almacén  especializado y compró su moto. Luego de escogerla, el  vendedor le advierte que si la deja fuera mientras llueve,  puede oxidarse. Así que le recomienda que siempre tenga un frasco de vaselina a la mano para untarle a la moto.   Unos meses después, el joven se enamora de una chica y  ella lo invita a su casa para que conociera a sus padres.   Cuando el joven llega en su moto, antes de entrar ella le advierte:    En mi familia hay una vieja tradición, y es que después de la cena, al primero que hable le toca lavar los platos'...   Después de una deliciosa cena, el joven se fija en la inmensa monta?a de platos sin lavar, mientras todos se sientan en silencio, esperando al primero que hable, pues nadie quería lavar.

A pilot, Michael Jordon, Bill Gates, the Pope, and a pizza delivery man were all in a plane together traveling through stormy conditions.      Suddenly, the pilot ran back to the passengers and announced that lightning had hit the plane, and they were going to crash in a matter of minutes. “There are only enough parachutes for four of the five of us,” he announced. “Since I’m the pilot, I get one!” After saying this, the pilot grabbed a parachute and jumped out of the plane.      “I’m the world’s greatest athlete,” proclaimed Michael Jordon. “This world needs great athletes, so I must live.” Michael Jordon then grabbed a parachute and leaped out of the plane.      “I’m the smartest man in the world,” bragged Bill Gates. “The world needs smart men, so I must also live!” Bill Gates grabbed a parachute and jumped out of the plane.      At this point, the Pope began to speak to the Pizza delivery boy. “I have lived a long life compared to you, and you may take the last parachute. I will go down with the plane.”      “You don’t have to do that, replied the pizza delivery guy. Bill Gates just jumped out with my backpack!”      Star if you like!^_^

I don't really care, but imagine what the main stream media would do with this picture. Just think of what that tabloids would say. Well, I do not know what to do, should i send the picture to TMZ for some some money or should I let it alone. I do know for a fact that many of his fans would love to see the picture. Oh, and trust me it is not altered, edited or photoshopped  in anyway. It is 100 % legitimate. So, my question is what should I do?

On their way in one of the boys dropped the sack and two of the conkers rolled out. 'We'll get those later,' he said, and in they went to divide up the remainder. As they were counting them out a small girl happened to be crossing the graveyard, and to her horror she heard from behind a bush a voice say, 'One for you, one for me. One for you' one for me!' In terror she rushed to the gate and bumped into a policeman. 'What's the matter, little girl?' He asked, for she was obviously in great distress.      'Oh, Mr. Policeman!' she wailed, 'there's ghosts in the graveyard, and they're sharing out the dead bodies! Listen!' And as she held a trembling finger to her lips they heard a voice say, 'One for you, one for me. And we mustn't forget those two by the gate!'

20081027173941AAanFQO	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	?uno al paso           ?	weno en verdad no es tan corto lo utilizo  como una estrategia para q lo lean pensando q es peqe?o pero weno creo q una sonrisa pueda reconpensar el tiempo q pierden leyendolo   son 10 frases q usan las mujeres    para ustedes chicas no se molesten veanlo como una broma   1.- OK!!!!. Esta es la palabra que las mujeres utilizan para finalizar una discusión, cuando han decidido que ellas tienen la razón y ahora debes callarte.      2.- CINCO MINUTOS. Si se está arreglando, significa MEDIA HORA. Si tú estás mirando el partido, y ella te dijo “cinco minutos”, entonces significa que te ha concedido sólo cinco minutos.      3.- NADA. Es la calma antes de la tormenta. Significa ALGO. Y deberías estar totalmente alerta esperando casi siempre lo peor. Discusiones que empiezan con “nada”, normalmente acaban con OK (Ver punto 1).      4.- NO HAY PROBLEMA. También puede ser “adelante, hazlo” o “no me molesta. Es un reto, y para nada significa que te está dando permiso. Ni se te ocurra hacerlo!.      5.- GRAN SUSPIRO. En realidad, es una palabra pero habitualmente los hombres no la entienden. Un suspiro alto y claro significa que ella piensa que eres idiota y que no sabe de dónde más sacar paciencia, para no mandarte a la “remierdita”. Además se pregunta por qué está perdiendo el tiempo contigo discutiendo sobre NADA. (Ver punto 3 para entender el significado de NADA).         6.- MUY BIEN!!. Esta es una de las frases más peligrosas que una mujer puede decir a un hombre. MUY BIEN significa que ella meditará maligna y cuidadosamente antes de decidir cómo y cuándo pagaras por tu grave equivocación.      7.- GRACIAS!. Si una mujer te agradece algo. No preguntes. No dudes. Solo di DE NADA.      8.- DA IGUAL. Se puede reemplazar por “como quieras”. Es la forma femenina de mandarte a la “conchita” y que de una u otra forma, más temprano que tarde buscará alguna forma de venganza.      9.- TRANQUILO, NO TE PREOCUPES, DéJALO ASí. Otra frase muy peligrosa, que normalmente se oye cuando la mujer le ha pedido al hombre que haga algo en especial, pero como él no lo hace, finalmente ella termina haciéndolo. Esto más tarde empujará al hombre a preguntar ?QUE PASA?. Para saber la respuesta de la mujer, ver punto 3.      10.- AAAAHHH!. Cuando la mujer le pregunta algo y el hombre da una explicación tonta o no creíble. Ella solo dice Aaaahhh… pero sabe que la respuesta no la convenció y ten por seguro que seguirá indagando por sus misteriosas vías.

I stole your precious sign, those famous white nine,   And I’ve blanked your ox-blood viaduct at times.   The bygone Aztec would now see his Capital decline;   Its current manifestation, one of my favorites to malign.      Where the United States has failed on often an occasion,   I forced the Ayatollah to shut down part of his nation.    I’ve grown strongest of late, but I’m no new invention,   Centuries ago an Anglo-King aimed at my prevention.      Many forms I have, and I look to the sky   Misspell my name and Lonely am I.   But to defeat me, well, the whole globe will have to try   Now tell me this: who am I?

Bonjour,      Je recherche le nom d'un navet du cinéma américain : j'aimerais bien le revoir car je ne me rappelle plus de la fin.      Voilà ce dont je me souviens : c'est l'histoire d'une femme qui n'a plus que 7 jours à vivre. Tous les jours elle a des indices sur le temps qui lui reste à vivre ; par exemple elle entend à la radio : "il ne vous reste plus que 7 jours",      La fois suivante, elle voit le nombre de jours restants écrit sur son miroir embué à la sortie de la douche.      Et tous les jours elle re?oit un signe comme ?a, je me rappelle même d'un panneau de signalisation avec un nombre de jours à la place des limitations.      Désolé pour le résumé, c'est très flou...      Néanmoins je compte sur vos talents de cinéphiles!      Bon courage ;-)

I just don't get what the hype was about.  Sure it has some of the greats, Chevy, Bill Murray, Rodney, etc.  I love all the classic 80's movies, but this one, I think is just decent.        The comedy is alright.  Gotta love the one liners.  Bill Murray, what is he retarded or something?  And the kid was a selfish prick kiss ***.  Was it the blondy?  Is that what did it for you?  The puppet?       So enlighten me.  Why do you like it so much?  And I'm sorry if I offended you with my blasphemy.

Personne ne vous tuera si vous n'en buvez pas ou si vous en buvez une d'une autre marque   2. La bière vous fiche la paix au sujet des pratiques sexuelles    3. La bière n'a jamais causé de guerre majeure    4. Personne n'impose la bière à des mineurs incapables de penser par eux-mêmes, c'est même interdit par la loi    5.

Il n'y a pas besoin d'attendre 2000 ans pour avoir une autre bière    8. La loi oblige les étiquettes de bière à vous dire la vérité    9. On peut prouver que la bière existe    10.

I   have some great news for you! I am getting married to the most beautiful   girl in town. She lives a block away and her name is Susan.    After dinner, George’s dad took him aside, “Son, I have to talk with you.”   “Look at your mother, George. She and I have been married 30 years, she’s a   wonderful wife and mother, but, she has never offered much excitement in the   bedroom, so I used to fool around with women a lot. Susan is actually your   half sister, and I’m afraid you can’t marry her.”    George was broken-hearted. After eight months he eventually started dating   girls again. A year later he came home and very proudly announced, “Dianne   said yes! We’re getting married in June.”    Again his father insisted on another private conversation and broke the sad   news. “Dianne is your half sister too, George. I’m awfully sorry about this”

It shows problems with kids, or anything in that regards, a good Ritu Jatak would remedy that aspect...)

However, you can say both if you so desire. Try to keep it under like 6 guitarists.      My favorites:   1 Jason Becker   2 Randy Rhoads   3 Jimi Hendrix   4 Steve Vai   5 Blues Saraceno      Steve Vai is most definitely the most talented out of all of those five. Then I would be inclined to say Jason Becker, followed by Blues Saraceno, then Randy Rhoads, and then Jimi Hendrix.      Now, of greatness overall as a musician: First goes Jason Becker and Jimi Hendrix, then the other three are about equal after those two in terms of "greatness"      Now you go!

20090308003234AA6F18t	Entertainment & Music;Movies	When will slumdog kids get their new homes?	1. Isn't it awful to takea kid from a slum into Hollywood, Disneyworld, luxury, and then let it back in the slum? When are they going to move into the new houses the Indian govt. promised them?   2. The movie producers said they didn't exploit the kids, but paid them above Indian wages (like these are normal wages) and their school fees. The film made over $100 million so far. And these people became close with these kids. How can they still let them live like this? Shouldn't the producers have bought a couple of homes for them? If I was in their place, I couldn't live with teh thought of teh kids who glorified me living in the slums. remember, that the Indian govt. decided to give these 1bedroom houses to them after the Oscars. Until then, there was no such option!

20090308005720AAGA9Y1	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Comments appreciated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?	The 43-year-old father-of-five told doctors he and his wife didn't want any more children. Their obvious solution was to start using condoms, but the condoms  wife of that man bought were a bit 'roomy'.      The couples solution for this small problem was not to buy new condoms that did fit, but to make the big ones fit. One way or another.      They used superglue to glue the condom to the man's penis. This did not only solve the size-issue, but they could also re-use the condom.      After sex, the couple realised the condom was stuck and wouldn't come off. After trying everything they could think off (and these people are resourceful as you may have noticed) They went to the local medical clinic for help.      One of the nurses said: "The man even said that he thought the condom could be used several times and that he wanted it stuck on his penis so he could use it again later. We barely managed to remove it in the end."

20081104184244AACvqER	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Is this a cool idea for a trap in the "Saw" series?	A man wakes up in a room with bracelet around his left arm. The bracelet contains a stretchable wire connecting to an electrical generator on the opposite side of the room. The Generator is protected by hard glass so the man can not break it.      The tape then says to unlock the bracelet he must find the key. The key is in the opposite arm. Therefore, the man must either choose to cut off the arm with the bracelet, or cut off the arm with the key, get the key, and take off the bracelet. If the man fails to do so, the Generator will send electricity through the wire into the bracelet and kill the man by electrictution. The man has three minutes and the only thing he can cut off his arm with is a knife he is provided with. Do you like this idea?

Ok so first off I am from a little state called Arkansas there is not very many famous people from here but Billy Bob Thorton and Even Essence. I am and have been trying for the music industry for 4 years now. Rap/Hip Hop music is my passion I love it. It just seems as if it requires money to make money. $50 to $100+/hour in a music studio which I don't have that kind of money. I am growing up in a small trailer park. I am 16 my mom is about all I got she don't make much money at all. What I need is a good free program that I can download to create my own beats. That would save me countless hours in a studio and save big $$. I used to have Propeller Head reason. But when I got a virus on my computer I had to wipe it and I lost my copy of Reason. They way I got reason was a friend told me he downloaded it for free of emule-project.com but for some reason I cant find it and I would just like to know of a place were I can download a great music producing program for free. So I can get my stuff on the radio and get noticed by a big time label. If anyone that reads this happens to be in the music industry my style is kinda on the eminem style so im told I dont like to be considered like him even tho he is who inspires me alot I just dont want to be like no 1 else. But my stuff is good i can make peoples bodies move with out a beat. But I dont think any1 wants to listen to a song with no beat.. Please Help I promised my self I will not grow old and have kids grow up the way I did and I plan to keep that promis.

20090308013204AAWRsND	Entertainment & Music;Movies	OK FFF, here's another obscure movie...?	It'll be a miracle if you get this one.  It's from the mid-70s and it's about a demonic possession or a child of Satan, who is a young man in high school or maybe at a prep school.  The ads showed him trying to get over a fence in the pouring rain during a bad thunderstorm with a gang of other boys his age obviously chasing him with intent to do him harm.  The voice over said "so and so can't get along with the other kids".  I went to see the movie because the ad was good, but the show was actually pretty different from the ad.  I can only remember the end where a monk in a robe is holding one of those crosses with the circle around the top and is using it to either collect or disburse energy.  It was a pretty cool lightning/laser type effect for the time.  I've been wondering about this film for 20 years and I promise I'll faint if anyone comes up with a title.
