My husband plays drums in a rock cover band, so he's always burning CDs from downloaded music to play while he drives so he can get familiar with the music. Anyway, it just seems like a tedious process and then he's got all these CDs everywhere all the time.      I was wondering if I got him an iPod, if that would make better sense? I imagine you can connect them to a car's audio system somehow, right? I thought it would be nice 'cause then he can take the thing with him to band practice and somehow hook it up there, too... I think.      I have to admit, I don't know much of ANYTHING about these things and I'm hoping you can help me out.... explain how they work and tell me if you think it would be helpful in my hubby's case? It would be a surprise gift if I got it, so I don't want to ask him about it. Thank you.........

Recently, I've been having a lot of problems with my ps1 game, final fantasy 8. It freezes at the scene where squall dances with the asian-looking girl (sorry if this is offensive, I don't know her name because I haven't gotten to that part yet.) I've tried leaving it on for about 5 hours to see if it would just complete the CGI scene and be OK. However, it failed to work, and only got about 35 seconds through at an average of 1 second per hour. I am afraid to try the toothpaste cleaning method and screw something up really bad. It does not go faster on a ps2. It's actually worse.      I have heard that on the old grey brick ps1 (the one I have been using) you can skip CG/CGI cinemas by opening and then closing the disc cover. I have tried this multiple times during the cgi scenes but they just freeze. What am I doing wrong???      Can I save my game?      Note: let me know if my ps1 is the problem, I'm going to try it on a friend's old brick ps1 if so. It's about 1.5 years older than mine, I think.      Please help!      -Smartcomputernerd

Ciao,    So d'un accordo nella telefonia mobile che ciascuno paga una parte della tratta (se uno  all'estero). Chi chiama dall'Italia, dal cellulare, paga la tratta italiana e chi riceve tutto il resto fino a dove si trova, giusto? ma che accade se uno, dall'Italia, chiama da un fisso?     Non paga tutta la tratta? in altre parole, chi all'estero, se riceve una telefonata sul cellulare, da un fisso, comunque paga?     Grazie e ciao

I think that image quality is the most important for me; I really have an emphasis on nice sharp and detailed pictures. Having the ability to customize my pictures and play around with aperture and focus is also very important. Some sort of manual focus is great.

Is it worth it to spend more on the canon powershot?? I dont know, please help!!

20090205153043AAPJKzB	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	How can I get Verizon Wireless?  Parents w/ kids who have cell phones...?	Alright, I just got a pay as you go phone about a year ago.  It's not too bad, but the only problem is...I text a lot.  I'm on a plan where I get a limited number of texts (it's not a small number, but it's definitely not large) and everyone I know--EVERYONE--has Verizon.  So basically, I always go over.  Since it's prepaid, and I usually use up a lot of minutes, we spend about thirty dollars a month on my phone anyway...so is this a good argument to go on to convince my parents to let me get Verizon?  They could pay the bill, and I would pay for the texting myself because it'd just be ten dollars.  And is there some kind of family plan that could help also if maybe me and one parent joined or something?  We're not exactly short on money, but we're a bit stingy.  Not too much, but my parents say Verizon's too expensive, while I think it's actually worth it, considering how much I text.   Any advice would be appreciated (especially from parents with kids who use cell phones a lot, maybe...?) and I'm sorry it's so long!!    Thanks!
