I'm 17, I'm a junior in highschool, & school drives me crazy because it seems like I don't really have anyone there to talk to.. I have a few close friends that I can be myself with but they all have one BEST friend that they are always hanging with but I dont have that one best friend.. I have a boyfriend who graduated when i was a freshman weve been together for 2 years, without him, i would go crazy.   It just seems like when i try to talk to people, no one ever listens.   No one ever calls me, ever wants to hang out or anything.   I feel like people completely ignore me,   I try to hang out with my friends, but there all too busy..   I don't know exactly what it is about me,   but it just seems like no one wants to get to know ME.   but they all spend time with each other.   sorry if its confusing,   I know im a nice person, im fun to be with, i guess sometimes i have a little trouble being myself with people.   but it doesnt help even when i do..   advice, anyone?

20090307102730AAniwco	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Planning on getting married to my girlfriend?	My long distance girlfriend & I have been talking about marriage for some time now. We've been together 8 1/2 months & recently have been discussing getting a place & starting our family together. She has two children from a previous marriage & is getting ready to divorce her husband. Her mother & my father aren't approving of gay relationships, but her mother is acceptable to it (my father is completely against it as well as my twin brother). We've never been together physically, but know that we're meant to be. We both plan on visiting each other soon to decided where we're going to live (she's in Mississippi & I'm in Louisiana).       I work year round as a teacher & she's currently trying to find a stable job doing correctional officer work in a prison. My job pays for me to go to school & get my degree(s), so I feel like I should keep my job for that reason & her & her children should move here to Louisiana. She wants for me to quit my job & move there to take care of her & the children. Her children are going back & forth about moving , but in a way really don't care as long as they're with their mommas.       How can we make these important choices  about our future together (living arrangements, marriage, other children,etc.) without feeding into the negativity around us? Any advice given is greatly appreciated.       Thanks!!!

I have a question that I have been struggeling with for two years.   There is this girl i work for, and eversince she found out about my sexual orientation she has been flirting with me.  Winking at me, touching me and people even asked with if we were in a relationship.  About two weeks ago she came along to fetch some of her things, and she talked about her boyfriend for the first time.  The thing is I don't know if she is using me to do the work for her, because she might know that I like her.  And if she is bisexual and wants to try something with me.  Everytime we are alone, there is something between us, but i pull away because i respect her to much, and don't want to hurt her.  She is always trying to touch me and when i pull away she closes in on me.  I sometimes get phone calls from her and then she don't know why she phoned me.  I really don't know what to do guys and girls.  Would really like some help with this. Thanks so long.

Therefore, Jesus, through these miracles, merely manifests His Presence in a more tangible way.

20090227135817AACQcJW	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	A question for Black people (of all spectrums): The Paradox of 'Self-Hatred'?	Self-hatred is in its fundamental roots, the act of believing, adopting or changing one's cultural/aesthete in the hopes of being accepted by someone who is of another race. Self-hatred is primarily signature to Non-White groups (Asians, Blacks, etc), and is an inherently oppressive ideology that sets forth that individuals have to abolish their culture/distinguishing aesthete features to move to what is deemed as "normality".       The main question is, is the oppressive nature of Self-Hatred caused by the fundamental roots of Western societies (e.g. the ownership on the Media to proclaim what is "beautiful"), or is it an oppressive ideology that Non-White groups subjugate themselves into? I have been told often by several people that I speak in an esoteric manner, so I'm going to use an analogy so that you can understand what I'm trying to ask:       --   Take for example a Black woman named Woman X. Woman X watches TV 5 hours a day on average. With the constant adverts discreetly telling her that she has to adopt Western versions of beauty to look "beautiful", she embarks on a operation to reduce the size of her lips, thin her nose and lighten her skin.      She finishes the operation and she meets up with some friends of hers. Friend A, who happens to be Black, immediately notices the difference in appearance of Woman X. She instantly responds to such changes by labeling Woman X as a "Self-hater" and their friendship ends there.   --   As see in the analogy, Woman X decides to change her physical appearance due to the notions of the Media. Her friend destroys their relationship due to Woman X's self-hatred.       What form of oppression does the doctrines of Self-Hatred possess - that Non-White individuals have to succumb to the whims of the Media so that they appear aesthetically pleasing? Or  that whatever Non-White individuals do to their body is "constantly regulated" by fellow Non-White individuals - whatever they do to their body is deemed as a profession and act of self-hatred?       I don't usually say this, but if you're going to give a relatively rubbish answer, please pass this question. Not to be an elitist, but I've noticed the sharp decrease in the value of questions and answers asked in this category.       ~

20090227141257AA8M0wL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christian views on HIV?	A Colorado State Senator opposed a bill to require HIV testing to pregnant women on the grounds that it would prevent pregnant women from seeing the negative consequences to sexual immorality. Please note that the women already have it, for whatever reason; testing benefits the baby only...      As he is fully aware:  http://coloradoindependent.com/22746/sta...       More information here too:  http://coloradoindependent.com/22701/sch...       I thought this was pretty incompatible with a pro-life platform, personally, and can't imagine even a sizable minority of Christians would endorse these views, but I've been wrong before. While he was the only Senator to vote against the bill, the Republican leadership refused to criticize him on it either, which leads me to believe this thought (if only that women with HIV deserve it) might be more widespread than it appears.      Thoughts, opinions? Please denote your religion as well.
20090227141752AAp0frn	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Should conditional public apologies be unacceptable?	Plenty of previous conditional apologies have been utterred, here is a very recent one:       http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090227/wl_n...       Bishop Richard Williamson denied the existence of gas chambers regarding the holocaust, the Vatican demanded a public apology from the bishop, who responded:      "To all souls that took honest scandal from what I said, before God I apologize"      The Vatican did not accept this apology - which I fully agree with their decision. That took guts for the Vatican to do, then they banished this bishop from the church!      I do not follow any religion and have no jewish heritage, but this story really struck me as not following the norm of issuing a pathetic apology and everything is back to normal.

20070320093342AAhD6PC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is Christianity over?	I just confirmed with several sources that a Catholic priest discovered, in the vatican's vaults, early, pre-Church documents that showed how Christianity was completely invented!   He took the documents and fled the Church, and claims that the Vatican will stop at nothing to silence him.      a translation:   "...plans to construct a religion based on the ideas of one Saul of Tarsus. This religion will be used to unite the hearts and minds of people into a wholly committed political force.      ...This religion will be constructed via the prophecies of the Hebrew scriptures. We will select the scriptures that confirm our ideals and also the ones that will reinforce these ideals by convicting the individuals at their most fundamental insecurity... We will make love the primary objective, thus sealing the ideals in their hearts...   We will take the Christian myths and codify them into a continuation of Hebrew scriptures... Finally, we have in hand, a way to free the World of the bondages of tyranny"

Hi   My question is specific to people who know the laws for SCOTLAND only please.      My grandmother is in hospital and the doctors have told us we now need to find her a nursing home.      My grandfather is still living in the material home, can he be made to sell it to pay for her care?      Who pays for her care?  Family, the state?      I have searched for more info on this but unsuccessful.  if you could suggest any websites etc for more info I would be very grateful
20090227141208AASZXeA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Revision of last question?	When I said I want to live forever, I was using that as an example of wanting something so much, that it becomes true. "Because you can't prove he exists, then he doesn't" - "Because you can't disprove he exists, he does." I'm looking at the floor. You come along and tell me that there is a chair on the floor where I'm looking. I don't see it, but I say "If you can prove it, then I'll beleive you." He says "Can you prove to me it's not there?" This is what religion is like to me. People are convinced that god exists, but they don't know why they do. "faith" is an excuse and a substitute for a real explaination. Does any of this make sense to any of you?

People who live in the US (that were born here), but whose ancestors originated in Africa are now called African Americans.

20070705023014AA8ZskI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Vegan food and religious laws?	I'm not vegan or vegetarian, I would like to serve vegan food for my wedding because my guests are from different religious backgrounds (Jews, Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Taoists, Sikhs) while the others are atheists and agnostics.      This is also because I do not want to group them according to their religion and assign them to the same table. I want them to make new friends, feel safe about eating everything I serve at the wedding and enjoy. Of course alcoholic drinks, wines (kosher or otherwise), milk (in the form of ice cream or some kind of desert) will be served unopened if any of my guests orders for it.      I also posted this question under religion so that those of that religion can help out in giving me additional information about their dietary laws in case I make a mistake and offend someone.      Is this a good idea? Or do you have something to say to improve this? Thank you very much for your help.

20070218013654AAtp4tg	Society & Culture;Holidays;Other - Holidays	Why is Black history month in February?	I think it's VERY corrupted that Black history month is in February (the shortest month of the year) When MLK b-day is in Jan(the beginning of the year.) Let's face it, because of slavery African Americans really started this country and economy before it became abolished. Why should we not have a FULL month of our history! I read a similiar question to mine and it said because Abe Lincoln's b-day is this month and HE abolished slavery. Don't be fooled by my avatar. I'm NOT a dumb pothead.  For the record Abraham Lincoln really only abolished slavery in the North. To get more votes because he knew if some slaves were set free and became LEGAL citizens he could get more votes. He didn't push for freedom in the south. Did U know that slavery didn't offically end until 1928? Don't believe me? Well look it up:)  http://www.archives.state.al.us/thisweek...   Yet, we have Columbus Day and he was a idiot who didn't discover anything!!!! LOL. To me this country, is still RACIST

Last week when she was leaving church with her friends she told me we can have coffee to discuss anything. I took no notice at the time.      Last night I saw her at church gathering. We made about 5 silent eye contacts in which she keeps looking away. She started small talk with me again. During the night I notice we kept making silent eye contacts.

I was over my friend's home and was at the table to eat with the family.  There was a bowl of stew and a bowl of salad in the center of the table to serve yourself from and everyone had a plate in front of them.        The 16 years old took a roll and started dipping it in and eating out of the bowl of stew rather than put it on his plate.  He didn't do it once but several times with his fingers in the bowl.

20071207154207AASi78C	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A question about christianity and movies such as Narnia and Golden Compass?	It seems really silly to me that christians and the church are calling to boycott the Golden Compass Movie. I am an atheist, and don't really notice or care for that matter, if a movie has a religious theme or not. I enjoyed Narnia, and didn't notice that it had a christian theme.    I haven't seen the Golden Compass yet, but my question is this:   Why are christians more concerned with the Golden Compass depicting an evil church and souls in animal form, which is clearly FICTION, than with a movie that is also, clearly FICTION (narnia) that uses the story of Jesus? To me,  Narnia could create more questioning in the mind of a child... they could associate how fictional the story of narnia is, and that the story of Jesus is similar in many ways, so it may be fictional as well?   Rather than a movie where EVERYTHING is fictional, just as any other movie?

20081030183952AAW1g8m	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Do I owe it to my boyfriend to give us a chance?	Sorry about the length. Here goes... I'm 24, bisexual, I've been with my boyfriend for 4 and a half years. I thought he was the love of my life... until I met a woman 6 months ago, and my boyfriend suggested I could see her openly.. now I feel that I am in love with her.      It gets trickier. My boyfriend is 37, and has problems with self esteem and also a bit of a dependence on alcohol to escape from his problems. He relocated to be with me, and we live together. He has no friends here, or at home, since he is so shy. Since he moved here, he has been through 3 jobs, was unemployed between June-Sept, and it has just been a year of stress with house moves and other things going on.      I am worried that if I left him, he would fall to pieces. I know that he adores me and would be devastated if we ended. His longest relationship before me only lasted about 6 months. We have pets who I love to pieces and a mortgage and both of us felt that we would be together for the rest of our lives.       I just can't get this woman out of my mind. Everything has come to a head and, understandably, he doesn't want me to see her any more. I am being forced to make a decision and I really don't know how to make it.      I feel that I love him so much and he is such a sweet and brilliant person - but there is just no spark.       I am getting conflicting advice from friends and family. Some say I am wasting my time and his, and that I should leave him. Others say that we have been through such a hard time and he gave up a lot to be with me, so I should try to work it out for 6 months and see how it goes.      I just don't know what to do. I love where I live, my life, everything that I have. I can't get my head around the thought of leaving him. But now I feel that I've been shown something more and that what I have with my boyfriend isn't a relationship; but a very deep friendship.      I feel so guilty and hate the thought of hurting either of them. I feel that my boyfriend would fall apart if I left him, and that I am hurting this woman every day by not being with her. I really don't know what to do and I could really use some advice...

20070927194404AAaNsx7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Scary Question -- Does this Satanist care more for the Phelps Grandkids than their own Grandfather and Parents	In looking up a link on another question to a video "starring" members of the Westboro "Baptist" Church, I ran across an interesting pair of YouTube videos by a Satanist who is a member of what he calls the "United Satanic Empire".      After reading some Old Testament Scriptures to "challenge" the WBC he calls for people to contact the Kansas Child Protective Services agencies, especially in Topeka.  The reason for this is simply that the WBC has SMALL CHILDREN as part of their protests and the Satanist's contention is that these children are being used as "Human Shields".  He agrees that the adults should be allowed to picket, but he expresses concern that the children might be injured.

You have 12 people standing before a judge and they are all claiming to have seen a man that they knew and loved die a horific death, the public knowing of the claims, that this man will rise again in three days,sent an army of soldiers to guard his tomb in case someone wanted to steel his body, After 3 days these men all claimed that their friend came to them again alive and over came death.  Even the soldiers could not understand how this could ever happen.  but any ways these 12 men after talking to this person and knowing this person was confinced that He was the Son of God and even died for their belief.  They were tortured and all they had to do is say it was a lie and they would be set free but they all refused.  OK maybe you may get one insane person to do this but 12 people from all walks of lives were convinced of this man's resurrection. This isn't heresay they are eye witnesses.

20070914080840AA9T3Y5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does God tell you to do stuff?	Most Christians say that God has spoken to them, sometimes literally, sometimes through prayer.  When we hear about people who kill their children or other people because they say “God told them to do it,” we all (including most Christians) think they are delusional.  In the Old Testament, God told people to kill others on several occasions.  How do Christians know that God didn’t really tell these “crazy” people to kill their children or others?  For example, what if I said God told me to gather my friends and go into a neighboring town and kill every firstborn child.  How would you know he didn’t really tell me this?  I think it is because you know that no God tells anyone to do anything, good or bad.  When “God helps you,” it is not really a God that is helping you, but your own conscious.  You use your conscious to make decisions and then you call it God.  Did a God give you your conscious?  Maybe so, but all humans that have ever existed have had a conscious; people of all religions, people long before the supposed coming of Jesus.  If a God has anything to with consciousness, it is not any Christian God.  It is a God for all humans.  Your thoughts?

About 7% of caucasians in the u.s. could not smell the odor of musk.  If both parents could not smell musk, then none of thier children were abgle to smell it.  On the other hand two parents who could smell musk generally had children who could smell it, too, but a few of the children in those familes were unable to smell it.  if a single pair of alleles governs this trait, is the ability to smell musk best explained as an example of dominant or recessive inheritance?      please help....thanks.

20070907211700AAHbQ90	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Should fundie churches be required to place a statement in the front of their Bibles?	One that would be similar to the sticker that fundies wanted to put in the front cover of science textbooks.  This was proposed in the interest of 'fairness.'  So to be fair on the religious end of the spectrum, and for consistency's sake, the statement could read something like this:  We require that believers take the Bible literally.  However, this is just a theory.  It is still being tested and new evidence which decimates this theory is being found all the time.  Our theory is not fact.  There are other interpretive strategies that explain things differently.  Some strategies draw on the higher criticisms, original languages, and the history of other Christian groups of antiquity to arrive at interpretations that are more allegorical and metaphorical.  These interpretations are much more well grounded in antiquity that the literalist strategy, which is new in comparison, and therefore not original to the early church."      This way, all sides of the argument could be tested.

20070804123036AANWRlX	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why are westerners so attracted to atheism?	I discussed the issue with some friends and, other than the usual cliched answers, they gave some explanations namely:          1. Because of a gambler's principle which says that the richer you are the more likely you are to gamble. Therefore, people in western countries are more willing to gamble away their eternity.      2. Another gambler's principle which says that a person would much rather win a million dollars in a casino than to work for it. Therefore westerners like to think that the universe and life started just by chance.      3. Because they live in highly organized and regulated societies and it results in a psychological phenomenon that could be referred to as "beast envy". Therefore they eagerly embrace theories like evolution which IMPLY that humans are merely animals.      I think these theories have some truth in them, but I'd like to hear other explanations. But please not vain ones like "because they are more educated". That obviously has nothing to do with it.       Thanks.

When we first got together I helped my ex paint and told my girlfriend that I was at my aunt's house. Then a few months later she saw that I had been communicating with my ex. Now, the latest lie was that I came out to my mother. The truth is, I tried, but my mother did not want to hear it. I told my girlfriend that I came out before I spoke with my mother and when my mother told me that she didn't want to hear it, I didn't push the issue and I never told my girlfriend any different.      Now, my girlfriend says that she is tired of my lying and doesn't know if she wants to be with me, despite the fact that we have said that each other are "the one" and I want to marry her. I know my track record sucks, but I am done with lying. How do I show my girlfriend. Any lie that I could tell is not worth losing her. I love her and I am going to be honest, even when it is hard. How can I show her and keep her

What about the Qu'ran  and Muslims ? they have heaven and they have a holy book too , doesn't this make them "saved" too ( BTW Muslims know Jesus )       How is a bible ( a product of men ) be the word of God ?      Jesus never said "go ahead ,wright a book "  and it was written hundred of years later ?      They translated the bible many times , so how do you know it's the truth ? because the Bible it self tells so ?         Buddhism has Heaven too ( different but they have ) so not only Christians are going to Heaven because other religious people know Heaven too ?      Jesus is the only way... IN CHRISTIANITY but not in Muslim or islam or Buddhism or Hinduism or Pagans ...      What I'm trying to say ... is that Christianity is a religion like any other religion and all religions were man-made and you are free to believe in God , Jesus, Buddha .....      remember " all for one and one for all " well " God is all for one and one for all , not only Christians ) so the Bible isn't a word of God .

With just normal black heels.      And then I would have my hair either half-up spiral curled,or the whole thing spiraled.   And,of course the sparkles.Haha.   I was also thinking like gold-yellow colored contacts,for the full vampire effect ;)            So just tell me what you think of that,and any other suggestions you have.

20090307091146AAz6r0g	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why do so few black people from the United States come to Canada to stay?	I noticed that most of the immigrants to Canada of African origin seem to immigrate to this country directly from either Africa or the Caribbean regions of the world and that relatively few come here from the United States.  Apart from the descendants of slaves who came to Canada through the Underground Railroad, relatively few black Americans come here to stay.  If they arrive on a sports contract they tend to move back as soon as it expires.      I once believed the common explanation that they had an intolerance toward the cold and were particularly bothered by it.  However, tolerance to cold seems to be connected more to the amount of body fat carried by the individual than it does to racial origin.  Besides, the blacks who come here from Africa and the Caribbean seem to have no trouble adapting to the cold.  They often take up winter sports.  It must be taken into consideration that most people do not feel comfortable when the temperature drops to a really low level.      Is some other factor at stake?

Jhn 8:58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.        I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: 'I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept His claim to be God.' That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would be either a lunatic — on a level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell.       You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronising nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to." - C.S.  Lewis - Mere Christianity

I'm not calling out all Christians, but it seems whenever this issue gets brought up, they always go to the whole "Atheists have no morals" argument.      From personal experience, I have had Christian friends that have cheated on their partners, stolen, lied... Yet their morals are never questioned. As an Atheist, this upsets me because it's implied that just because I have no belief in God must mean I also believe I can live my life however I want and according to whatever rules I choose. However this is not the case at all. So why are my morals always attacked?

He was screaming at her alot before and cursing, she told me hes crazy and she wont put up with it.   I havent really seen him since them, he came a couple of times to pick up food, but not talked to anyone, my brothers girlfriend answered the door and he hugged her thinking she was me and she had to convince him she wasnt. He seemed mentally diturbed and homeless. Also during all these years My Mom laughs loud, smiles and acts like shes the happiest person alive, at family functions everyone laughs and acts like nothings wrong and jokes and laughs...   Its so fake,, my neighbours give me looks like they feel bad for me they all know he was kicked out..

20090307110602AAweKnS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Here's a question about Adam and Eve?	First off, I don't believe in God or religion in general. It's all too unrealistic to me, based on the history of mankind. Seems to me God should have known he was creating a race of devils, which we are.   I have a right to make my own decision and not to believe as you have a right to believe. I hate when religious people, especially overly religious freaks try to force their beliefs on me.    My question is, if the first 2 people on earth were Adam and Eve, and they only had 2 sons, then how did the human race continue? Did they have sex with their mother because that would be the only way a baby could be born? It would not surprise me if someone reports this question. Overly religious people like to report those who's views are not theirs. Another reason I hate organized religion.

20090307110309AAvcMpx	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How did God NOT create sin?	Colossians 1:16 "For by him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him."      This clearly states that God created ALL things.  With logic, please tell me how he didn't create evil.  Evil is here, a part of reality and we can all agree on that.       An all powerful deity could create anything w/ any possibilities right?  God could make intelligent life form w/ choice with out the possibility of evil right?  If he couldn't then he must not be all powerful.        Oh and also, before I get the answer "he created the possibility of evil, we just chose that", why didn't he create a reality w/o the possibility of evil but still w/ free choice if he is all powerful.      Remember to use logic.

And you know they are wrong, but you are in a group of people and don’t want to get into an argument, etc? But, at the same time remaining the dominant person in the group and maintaining a good image.      I would imagine, that if someone tried to argue with someone like a millionaire or a celebrity they would not want to get into an argument, that was beneath them and my harm their image, but at the same time would want to defuse the situation, shut the person up, but still remain on top!

20090307103238AAY1Dco	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I found out today I have worms why did god do this to me?	I cant belive this happened to me. I am a surfer from California. For like the last couple weeks I have had cramps and I lost like 20 pounds. I went to the doctor and he said I had worms. He said I would be fine. I am still upset though. Why would God give me worms? Why would God make worms? Is he trying to tell me I need to lose weight? I am not fat since I am a surfer from Cali. I wonder if it has something to do with sperm. Sperm are like little tadpoles you know. Since God makes sperm to make people maybe he has to make worms to make something else. Maybe worms turn into animals. Some animals eat poop so first god makes the worm and puts it into the person then the peson poops out the worm then the animal eats the poop then it can have another animal. Right?

20090307104102AAYUD4T	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is this a real friend?	I've never had a ton of friends; I much prefer a smaller group of friends. At this moment, however, I'm wondering if I have any friends at all.      I have this one (straight) friend, and we've known each other for around 4 years or so. I came out to him 4-5 months ago, he was ok with it. Before I came out to him, I would always discuss with him whatever relationship type issues he'd have, be it a girl he liked, or problems he was having with a certain girl. Well anyway, one day, long after I came out to him, I mentioned how I was seeing an ex of mine on a much-more-than-desired basis. That was it. I didn't mention anything more than that. Of course I said I didn't want to see the guy anymore and that I didn't really want to say hi, even though I felt I should. That conversation with him (over AIM), ended with him telling me it was awkward and that we shouldn't talk about relationships anymore.      I didn't say it at the time, but I was, and still am very hurt by it. I mean, it's not like I started spouting out sexual details. I was just mentioning this important part of what was going on with me. We go out with other friends and guess what's talked about? You got it, his girl problems/issues/etc. Was I wrong in expecting someone who I figured was a true friend to at least listen to the said problem without telling me what he did? I mean, it sucks for me, because I'm going through something right now, and really wish I had that friend to talk with about it (it's actually kinda funny, not pouty/omg emo), but it does deal in relationships.      So I guess what I'm basically asking is, what should I do? I'm obviously very hurt by this, and it's been bugging me since it happened. I just unfortunately feel like I've pulled the short stick in choosing my short-list of friends, or in this case, friend.

20081110224050AAkmR55	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Cashier mistakes - do you get very annoyed?	I've been only cashiering for only 4 days now. It's normal to make many mistakes on your first day on the job (let alone your first job). That I know. But I still feel very guilty. I do apologize to the customer sincerely. =(      But I'm just curious - if the cashiers are new, do you forgive them quickly (and they're very polite to you, even though you're rude to them on that particular day/in a hurry)?      1. You wanted to pay by check, and they accidently hit the "cash" tender button and can't reverse the mistake. It takes a long process/you have to go to an ATM just two feet away to take out money to get things done.      2. You exchanged your item for something and trust the cashier to turn it in (something that's about $13). But there was a mix up and your exchanged-item was picked up by an employee and they can't find the item in a large stack.      3. They can't find the barcode and have to run off to look for another item to scan for you.      4. They have yet to learn discount codes and have to take 10 minutes of your time to ask their trainer about it.         Obvious, that's my most common mistake/others that I've talked to about. Aside from giving the wrong change. *sigh*

I ask because recently it happened to me and I want to see if other peoples stories are as embarrassing as mine.      I'm 17 and play rep soccer, our team is really good and fun to play on. This happened to me last practice and im still embarrassed by it. We were having a fun game and we began playing shirts and skins, so to show off my muscular body I joined the skins side, then I went up to Devra (Devra was the only girl on the team, she is somewhat pretty and fun to mess around with, we loved pocking jokes at the fact that shes the only girl) so I asked her "why dint you join the skins side" and she said "because I dint want you guys watching me run around in my bra and panties" then as I was standing there talking to her, one of my team mates runs up and pulls my shorts to my ankles, what makes it even worse is the fact that when I play soccer I wear bikini briefs because they are way comfier, and on that particular day I was wearing this really small and embarrassing white pair. So I bent down and pulled up my pants but everyone saw my little underwear, including Devra who was laughing hysterically and said "wow looks like im not the only one who wears panties on this team". So then after the practice as she is leaving she comes up to me and says "see you later Steve, by the way your little undies made my night" and she still has not let it go.

Dear potential volunteers,      My name is Hakim Husein and I am a former employee at Best Buy. Currently I am an AmeriCorps volunteer working at the Arab American Cultural and Community Center. The Arab American Cultural and Community Center is a non-profit organization that is federally funded by AmeriCorps and the United States Government. The Arab American Cultural and Community Center brings together people from various cultural backgrounds and allows them to voice their opinions on matters and to be of service to the community.        The Arab American Cultural and Community Center holds various community service events each year. We try to be involved in the community as much as possible. We at the Arab American Community Center have an AmeriCorps National Service Day coming up on May 16th, 2009. After much consideration, my co-workers and I have reached an agreement on a worthy cause to support.   We would like to help the DePelchin Children’s Center on that day. We are currently holding a drive for various items i.e. hygiene products, clothes/shoes, and so on.       We plan on having this charity drive at a number of places including our very own Arab Community Center, various churches, local schools/universities and local business. I am pleased to report to be receiving a strong show of support from the community. This drive will remain open no later then May 13, 2009. On the actually National Service Day of May 16th, we will have a variety of fun and educational activities, at the DePelchin Center planned for foster teenagers of ages ranging from 13-17 years old such as basketball camps, martial arts, belly dancing classes, a magic show and so much more.    Requirements to be a volunteer will be included in the package I will provide you and if possible, we would also love to set up an appointment to discuss this opportunity further. If you have any concerns or would like to give me any advice in regards to our National Service Day, please do not hesitate to give me a call at my personal number at 832-221-5424. Thank you so much for everything you do and I look forward to working with you on this worthy cause.            Sincerely,      Hakim Husein

I thought so, I thought the difference was accepting Christ or not.  Muslims revere Jesus as a prophet, but not the Son of God   Muslims honor and respect Jesus, son of Mary (peace be upon him and all of God's prophets).  Muslims believe that he was one in a long line of honorable prophets, who taught his people to worship and obey the One True Lord, the Creator.  The Qur'an describes him:      He [Jesus] was no more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and we made him an example to the Children of Israel....           Soooo.... If they made Jesus an example they need to tend to those who are in need and show them Gods Love, if after showing them mercy and Gods grace they reject HIM, then shake the dust from your sandals and be on your way!!                Is the Muslim and Christian animosity not like “which child is loved more” syndrome?  If we both love and respect the same God wouldn’t it be in our best interest to work on our common ground?
