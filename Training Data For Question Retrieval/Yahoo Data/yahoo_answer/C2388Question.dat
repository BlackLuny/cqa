20090128143117AAwK6Z8	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Dorm room issues....Please help!!!?	Here we go again,    My room mates are being rediculous. They have made freshman year of college complete hell. I don't even know where to begin. After Winter Break, I brought back almost $150 worth of food. We didn't have classes on Monday or Tuesday, but I moved my stuff in on Monday. Tuesday night I came back and 2 packs of the 3 packs of soda I had were gone. It has been 2 weeks and almost half of the food is gone. Last weekend I said something to them that they could eat it, but I couldn't afford to feed everyone and their families. They give out food to their friends and the guys completely demolish it. They got completely defensive when I asked that they just replenish what they take. They think I'm frugal and should be able to "share" my food. I don't have a problem sharing my food with my room mates, but it's when they take complete advantage of me.    Then, when I was putting my stuff away, someone had slept in my bed over the weekend. My room mate denied it, although I made my bed before I left for the weekend. She even went to the extent to blame it on my friend, whom of which I brought home with me.    My room mates sit there and talk **** about me. They make it so awkward to be in there with them, and I know they talk to my suite mates about everything too bc it is just as awkward when I am with them too.    Today, my friend, who I asked to room with next year, told my current room mates something I had told her confidentially. This has made it even more awkward.    Everyone says just to make the best of it, but ultimately, Freshman year has sucked. It has sucked so bad that I have even thought about dropping out.    Am I being too critical about all of this, or should I just let it all go. I'm just sick of crying everyday and being depressed. More off, I am tired of doing everything on my own. That's not what college is supposed to be like

I realized that more than anything else, I want to go to stanford.   I am a sophomore in high school. Last year my gpa was a 4.0, and i was enrolled in 3 honors classes. This year I am in honors english, and honors algebra. I have an A in all of my classes, except for in math, where i have a B+.   Next year I will begin my 2 year IB career. Our school offers an international baccalaureate program, and I am planning on getting the diploma at the end of my high school career.   As far as extra curricular activities, I was on JV cross country in the fall [ and plan to continue cross country in the next 2 years]. I volunteer at the red cross several times a month, and I might have gotten an internship/science research partnership class type thing at OHSU. Also, this summer, I will be joining several other classmates on a month long exchange trip to Germany, where I will further study the language.      Anyways, sorry for talking so much, I was wondering what there is that I could do that would set myself apart from other applicants, and what your experience with getting into the school of your choice.   I know it's early to be considering this, but I'd love to be prepared.      Thanks!

The other day my substitute teacher would not allow me to go to the bathroom. I was in Honors Chemistry and the entire class was working on worksheets. Yes, the class was quietly talking but we were not being very loud or distruptive. When i asked my substitute, he said i was not allowed to go because the class was talking. Do you think this was right? I had my period and was so worried for the next 40 minutes that it might get on my pants? I find this ridiculous. How can any human being tell another human being they are not allowed to go to the bathroom? What are your thoughts on this?

20090128144245AAxBXEu	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Essay about Junk Food?	Tell me what you think. Its for my tenth grade english class.      Junk Food    Each year, schools all over the United States brings in thousands of dollars due to the distribution of junk foods. Ooltewah High School is definitely no acceptation. However, selling unhealthy foods at school is not the brightest idea our administration thought of. Students being able to purchase these snacks at school can cause obesity, make students hyper, and makes more of a mess around the schools premises.   Believe it or not, but the United States has the highest percentage of obese teenagers. The fact that schools sell junk food defiantly does not help with this dilemma. During lunch, most teenagers do not have anything healthy to eat. Most of the time, our school doesn't even have healthy food on the menu. Healthy food should be available at all times.    Most of the time when sugar is involved, it tends to make students hyper which probably isn't a good thing. This can eventually lead to violence during school hours. Also,  It can make students not focus during valuable class time. Students are either too busy eating their food or they are just so hyper, they cant concentrate. Concentration is a key factor in receiving an education.   Ooltewah High School is already nasty enough, why should we dirty it up even more by selling junk food. Students certainly think of creative things to do with candy. Whether it mean sticking them to ceilings or throwing them at friends, there will always be a mess associated with candy. For some reason, students dont know what a trash can is. They will just throw their wrappers everywhere.   In conclusion, Junk food should, with out a doubt, be banished from school. It can lead to obesity, make students extra hyper, and dirty up our school. If it were up to me, I would say that we only allow junk food to be sold once a week. The other four days should be something healthy like a salad bar. Ooltewah High School should set an example to other schools and stop selling junk food from school.

20090128092909AAsKnFf	Education & Reference;Homework Help	I am writing a Descriptive Essay and would like some input and corrections before I turn this essay in ?	My Bedroom      Do you ever wonder why certain places mean so much to certain people? When I think of my bedroom, I realize why some people are touchy about who goes in their rooms or who has been touching things in their home, it is because those things are important to them and may have some meaning. Places like my bedroom are places where we can relax and be comfortable and I think that is why it is important to people, because we can be ourselves and feel comfortable,we can also just sit down and rest our bones and relax. Another important reason is we can go there when we want privacy,we can just shut our door, maybe even lock it, and tell everyone in our household not to bother us. Also our rooms hold most of our personal belongings and those things are important to us and we do not want anyone else to touch them or in some cases go near them.              Bedrooms are a place where we can be comfortable and we can sit back and relax. When Whether we are tired or not, feeling the best or not, we can go to our room, shut our door, and lay down and relax. Maybe even turn on some music or read a book or magazine. My bed is where I like to retreat to when I want to relax. I have a queen size sleigh bed with six pillows and my favorite comforter. It is a horse comforter,I know it is childish but my mother made it for me. And of course, my teddy bear, that a friend gave me for Christmas, sits on my bed and keeps me company. A lot of times I just lay  down and close my eyes and daydream about places I'd like to see or think about things that make me happy. One thing we should not do is think about things we need to get done or anything that makes us feel stressed because then we'll never feel relaxed. I usually try to stay away from these sort of thoughts and it usually works out well.              The reason my bedroom is so important to me is because my room holds all of my personal belongings, which are very important to me. Also my room is a comfortable place to study or just to relax.             I can also have privacy whenever I want it by resorting to my room, this may be hard for some people if they share a room. Whenever my mom is nagging at me or when I'm stressed out with school or work, I like to go into my room and just be myself. All my belongings in my room surround me and make me realize everything is going to be all right. It gives me a sense of security.             The way my room is set up makes it kind of cluttered, but that is the way I like it and I don't care what anyone says. As you first come into my room, to the left is my dresser. My dresser is full of things like perfume, jewelry, hair ties, my television and just a bunch of junk, mostly things that come out of my pockets at the end of the day. The dresser itself is brown with nine drawers, sets of three side by side. Diagonally across from that is my computer desk which holds all of homework and my computer, the cabinet is white with wooden shelves. Next to my bed which is in the middle of the room is my side table which holds my alarm clock and pictures and just odds and ends. Everything is worth keeping.             I believe that other people feel the same way about their rooms and homes, it gives people a sense of security in a way that you can control what goes in your room and who goes in your room. It sort of gives people power which may mean a lot to some people. My room holds almost all of my personal belongings, which I think almost everybody's rooms do. I am sort of protective of the things in my room because a lot of my belongings have sentimental value. My most treasured items are my trophys from when i used to show horses, which are placed neatly in my closet. I have about fifteen trophies and if anything would ever happen to those trophies I would be extremely upset and very furious. Nobody, except myself, is allowed to touch them, not even my mother.             I'm sort of a pack rat so I keep everything from old clothes to my childhood stuffed animals which are all neatly sitting on my hope chest in my room. My hope chest is filled with things I will need in the future like towels, cooking utensils, blankets, old picture frames and other little things, these things mean a lot to me because a lot of these objects belonged to my late grandmother and I am honored to own them. I treasure all my belongings and do not like other people to move or to borrow without asking and I think that a lot of people feel the same way. When someone touches our things we get upset and I think in a way we are sort of honoring our possessions.             What my point is that everybody has something or some place that is important to them and has meaning and a lot of times it is people's bedrooms and homes because it belongs to us and we cherish these places. Bedrooms are a place of comfort and in some cases a sense of security. It is a place of privacy when we need to be alone or just to sit down and take a load off. We can just be ourselves. So the next t
20090128093010AAtbzlF	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Does this paragraph have a thesis?	I wrote an essay on the book "Savage Inequalities" for my Philosophy and Society class. I want to know if I state a thesis clearly. Why or why not? Thanks so much!      In his book, Savage Inequalities, author Jonathan Kozol presents an argument explicating the injustices of the United States public school system. Published in 1991 and based on Kozol's personal visitations to many inner-city public schools, the text attempts to prove that the national system of public education denies the children of the lower class fair and equal opportunity. Although Kozol provides that certain disparities in the quality of education can be expected in the private sector, he claims the quality of public education should be equal across the nation, regardless of the socioeconomic background of each individual school district. To Kozol, the system is broken, and three major repairs must be mad: one to fix the crumbling physical infrastructure and inadequate facilities of the poorest schools, another to restructure the existing system that finances their education, and, finally, to desegregate and re-integrate the separate social classes and races into a more unified school network.

Went to Uni when I was 18 and failed miserably, the course was waaaay to hard and I was way too immature.       Have been financially independent since then and now four years on I've been offered an unconditional place at a nearby Uni on a different course. (I live in Wales if this makes a difference, my LEA is Denbighshire)      I've obviously looked through all the stuff and I'd be assessed as an independent student fortunately so if al goes well I'd get some serious financial help.       I'm not planning on working part-time, that's the mistake I made last time.       So does anyone have experience of returning to Uni and how this affects the financial help you get? There's notes on various forms that says it 'may be affected' by my failing before but nothing more specific.       Has anyone gone through this process?

I'm a first-time FAFSA filler-outer, for my oldest son who is currently attending college.      I filed it and when I saw the EFC I almost fainted. Then I thought back on it and realized I never entered any of my debt (which is just my primary home mortgage) or other expenses.       I noticed one section about Living Expense Allowances, but I thought that was for federal, state aid (welfare, etc.) received, is that right?      Now that I've filed it I can't go in and click the little ? icons to see more.       I guess my bottom line question is: "Did I miss something by not finding a place to enter my expenses and debt?"      Also if the EFC is almost the full amount of a year of college does that mean he can't get any loans or work study?      Thank you.

Ok, the majority of people in my french class were messing about and talking, so our french teacher gave us all a breaktime detention. I seriously wasnt messing around, because none of my friends are in that class and i wouldnt of had anybody to talk to. Anyway the next day (when the detention was on) I forgot all about it because we were getting the pathways for our options and choosing them in the next lesson, and also i had just had my braces put on and i couldnt eat so i was starving, so i went to get an apple. So now my french teacher has given me a after school half an hour detention. Which im ok about, because i know i should have remembered. But thats not all. Shes putting me on report, and my parents have to have meetings with her and its going on my record. I have to get it signed in every lesson. I dont think its fair. I didnt even do anything to deserve the first detention, let alone go on report! There is this boy who mucks about in her lesson all the time, and is really cheeky, and even hes not on one.

20090128140611AAB56yB	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Please proofread my essay!?	Thanks so much in advance! This is for College English, and is my first essay! It is a narrative, and the question is: Why are you in college?".    Thanks so much!         I saw the tears form in my grandmother’s eyes, and watched them roll down her cheek. She wiped them away and said, “Kayla, you have to do something for yourself.” Then she grabbed me and pulled me close to her. I inhaled her sweet perfume. Never in my life have I seen my grandmother cry. I began to think that maybe my situation was worse than I had realized.     Two weeks prior, my mother finally gave up on my father, and moved out of our home, taking my little sister with her. I stayed with my father. The house I grew up in was suddenly unbearable to live in. I wanted very badly to leave, and to move in with my mother, but I found it very difficult to tell that to my father. He was already going through a really hard time, but at least he had me. I can’t remember what triggered it, but I finally told my dad I couldn’t bear seeing my sister’s empty room, or to be in the house at all.    Slowly, piece by piece, I moved my belongings to my mom’s place. With the move came a calming breeze of maturity and independence. I was no longer working with my father in his business, so I had to get a job in the real world. It turned out to be a lot harder than I imagined. I began thinking about my future, and I didn’t feel so good anymore. I knew I didn’t want to work a little job for the rest of my life, not getting anywhere, not doing something that truly interested me.    My father is a high-school dropout. He owns his own business, and is very successful. Not only is he able to support his family, but he loves what he does. He has always told me that I could follow in his footsteps, making the business even bigger, and be able to make a great life for myself. According to him, college is a waste of time, because I would just end up working for some jerk of a boss anyway.    I had always wanted to go to college, but was afraid to upset my father. Plus, we never really had that kind of money to pay for tuition. To be honest, at the root of it all was that I was afraid. I was home-schooled for most of my high-school education. I had become withdrawn and shy. Going to college terrified me. I stuck the thought in the back of my mind and continued looking for a job.    While visiting with my grandmother, she asked how things were going, and how I was coping. It was hard not to cry as I begun to tell her how badly I felt for leaving my dad. She just looked at me, and I knew some tough love was coming my way. Instead, she just kept repeating the same words over and over. She looked me in the eye and said, “It’s not your fault. It’s not your fault. It’s not your problem. It’s his. It’s between him and your mother.” She went on to tell me that it was time I start taking care of myself, start thinking of what was best for me. She told me I shouldn’t worry about my mom or dad that they can take care of themselves. It was time to do something for myself.    After speaking with my grandmother, I knew exactly what I had to do. I drove directly to Gordon College, and picked up the information needed to enroll. I completed all the forms and returned them. I did not tell a soul I had done so. A few weeks later, I was surprised to receive an acceptance letter. I immediately took it to my grandmother. She was so proud. I told her that I would not have done it if it were not for her. I told her that she had helped me realize what was important, and where my priorities should be. She believed in me, which is exactly what I needed in order to take that step.   “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step”             (I will find who says this before I submit!)

And I need to freaking hurry up and finish my historical paper.      My project is on the Islamic Revolution (Iranian Revolution) of 1979 led by Ayatollah Khomeini.     Ayatollah Khomeini's real name was Ruhollah Khomeini. Ayatollah is a title.      So here's my question:      How did Khomeini receive his title of Ayatollah?       Now, right now, my only easily accessible source is Wikipedia. Wikipedia jumps from naming him Ruhollah to Ayatollah all of sudden, and I don't know at all how he received it.

20090128121336AA4IGN9	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Speech Editing Help???????	Heyy Everyone! My school is writing speeches right now. Im in grade 8, and I was assigned the topic of "leaving my school"      So, Im kind of having a writers block right now, could you read it and give me comments/suggestions? That would be great. And any time you see _____ that means I just took out the name of my school.. for obvious reasons. Thanks!      Here is my speech::      Ever since grade 5, I have been so anxious to be in grade 8. I thought of it as “Top of the school” and I knew that grade 8’s literally ran the school. When _______ started the leadership program, I wanted to be in Grade 8 even more. But, the one thing I didnt think about was how little time I would have to do these amazing things. Now that I’m finally in grade 8, I realize my time is short, in about 6 months, I will have to say good bye to everything, and everyone. I will have to say good bye to the school, the teachers, and my friends, and this is something im not ready to do.      When You look back on your past years at ______, what do you think about? Do you remember certain people or do you think of the good times you’ve had? When I think about my past at _________, I think about a combination of all those things. I think about the first time I met everyone, I think about all the amazing times and inside jokes I have with those people I have met. I havent been a part of the school as long as most, but the time I have spent at _______ has been amazing.       My past at ________ is very happy. I have memories that are as good as gold. I remember going to the amusement park in grade 6. I went on my first “big” roller coaster with all my friends, and I loved it. In the same day I went on drop zone, the one ride I swore I would never go on. I felt safe with my friends there. In grade 7 we went to _______. I loved that trip. We had so much freedom and I learned a lot. I went for the first time to the Hard Rock Cafe with all my friends. We had some really fun times at one of the resteraunts, and in our rooms at night. Especially when on one of the nights we were there, the American Idol and Girlicious season Finalies were on, and the teachers let us stay up a bit later to watch them.      This year, there is one word that stands out among the rest. This single word now has more meanings then it has ever had in my life. Time. The little time we have left in ______, the little time we have to spend with those friends we won’t get to see next year, to lead, and to leave our mark on the school. Time. The amazing times my friends and I have shared. Laughing, goofing around, and those serious times where we were all there for each other, because we knew that those people needed us. Time. To look forward to the times ahead, such as our ______ trip, sleep overs with friends, SOAR activities, and even those times in school when your so happy you feel like you will explode. Growing up happens in a heart beat. One day your in grade 6, shy as ever meeeting your new classmates. The next day you are graduating from grade school saying good bye. Since we have so little time, we have to always live in the present. If we dont.. time will slide by so fast, and before we know it, we will be hit with graduation. The time to say good bye. So we have to focus on the present. Right now. This very moment. This year I have made an extra effort to do this. When I’m laughing with my friends, I laugh a little bit longer, to keep the moment. I want these moments to last forever, thats why I will always live in the present.       When you live in the present, its not bad to think about the future. High school. The topic everyone seems to be talking about. The second someone even says the word, everyone breaks out into conversation. But really, who can blame us? There are just so many things to say! Things like, what school we are going to, what courses we will be taking, who will be going to the same school as us, what our school offers us that others dont, and the list goes on. Everyone is so nervous, including me. On the first day of school next year, we will be stepping into the unknown, entering a whole new world, and this world is almost four times the size of the world we are in right now. But that is the least of my worries. There is also the pressure to succeed. High School is when your marks count. Universities will be looking at our high school marks to see whether or not they want us in their school. On top of all that, there is way more peer pressure, bullies, and drugs. The high school I have decided to go to is ________. This school has about 1600 people attending. This is a big jump, seeing as _______ has only 400. I will be leaving _______ as a senior, and entering _______ as a freshman. Whenever I think of that, I think of the start of grade school. All the way back in grade one. I remember seeing all these tall scary people, and I was so intimidated by them because they were so much taller and bigger then me! Now, I look down at the little grade ones and

20090128150804AAaVjBc	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	What do you think of my writing?	“Never cease loving a person, and never give up  hope for him, for even the prodigal son who had fallen  most low, could still be saved; the bitterest enemy  and also he who was your friend could again be your  friend; love that has grown cold can kindle”   Soren Kierkegaard      If I do this, will I regain what I had lost? It's a tedious,dull, experience but if I do it will I obtain what I once had in the past? I've been labeled, labeled a failure and in the words of Kierkegaard "Once you label me you negate me".If I tried harder would it work? Or would my effort be futile? If I were to suddenly become "successful" would things amend? Would I obtain mutual acceptance? If so, would it be like the past? Or would it merely be a shoddy illusion of it? Truth be told, I long for my previous indifference but it seems as if my friend, apathy, has left this world. Albeit my memory be a calamity, it denied my request upon it to forget.      This may be an incentive, the incentive, that will change things for the better.      "Face the facts of being what you are, for that is what changes what you are."      Soren Kierkegaard      "I see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations - one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it - you will regret both."      Soren Kierkegaard      I only kept the Kierkegaard quotes since they were originally in there.What do you think of the section I wrote? Criticism advice et cetera.
