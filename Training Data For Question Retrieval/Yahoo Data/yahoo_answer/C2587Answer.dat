I can reset a CEL in minutes, but it could come bad if there is a real problem.<br>  <br>  My understanding is that the CEL data is held in "non-volatile" memory, not "volatile memory" so disconnecting the battery and bleeding any capacitors will not do it.

When it did have an issue (caused  by my now ex husband forgetting to replace the oil filter after changing the oil, not a problem caused by the age/condition of the car itself) it was incredibly cheap to repair. The biggest problem we had was it was fairly b@ll less going up hills. Since I ski frequently and drive up into the mountains to do so, it was definitely noticeable. Everyone in the car would be leaning forward in their seats as we went up the steeper grades - almost like we thought it would help the car get up the hill. :-p|`|NarA0558aa	1996 Geo Prizm, easily.

ksFD7EoSaa	Your mechanic should not have introduced you to this potentially destructive habit. Yes it works, but that occasional grinding that you mentioned is taking lots of miles and life away from that transmission. Maybe that was the intent of your mechanic, job security.Use the clutch and the life of your transmission will be greatly enhanced.

8VpoH6Xoaa	Banks products are far from the best that you can buy for your truck.  They make decent products, but they aren't the end all of parts.

The only way to make a decent wage is to work for a place where the students get in trouble for not showing up.  That would be a university program, or perhaps an airline sponsored one.

You must stop the car completely the same as you would if you were stopping at a traffic light.
wBrPA1Dlaa	LOL, changing a beetle headlight is not as easy as these guys would lead you to believe!  In theory it is a piece of cake,  but in reality it is not always so simple.  <br>  <br>  At this point I have changed hundreds  (beetle h/l bulbs)  and i still get one from time to time that is just a booger.  Usually the tough ones are on the older cars(such as yours).<br>  <br>  FYI: VW factory warranty pays .50 hour to change a beetle headlight bulb.  <br>  <br>  Customer pay is generally 1.5x warranty which would be .75<br>  <br>  Dealership labor rate is usually over $100 hour.<br>  <br>  The quote you were given is the going rate for this job at a dealership.  (mabye a little high,  the place i work charges i think about $65 all together)<br>  <br>  One thing to watch out for in the headlight of your car is the wiring harness(inside the headlight assembly) gets hot and goes bad over time.  if you get some joe to toss in a bulb and he ignores this you will end up replacing a lot of bulbs.<br>  <br>  One good thing to know about using the dealership is they will warranty parts and labor for a year.  <br>  <br>  If this quote was given to you by anyone other than a dealership then yes, take your business elsewhere.  <br>  <br>  Feel free to look elsewhere anyways as you are sure to find someone to do it cheaper.  when he is done make sure the headlight is seated properly in the bucket.<br>  <br>  If you ask a friend or neighbor to do this job they will surely curse the day they met you!|`|3cf54b98aab3159bdd02ab505ad9368eaa	Sorry.. but I can not envision a headlight bulb that requires much more then a screwdriver (and maybe pliers) to change unless it is because of an accident.<br>  <br>  Go to a local auto parts store and buy the light.   While you are there take a quick glance at a service manual for your car and check out the headlight assembly page.  (Heck.. for $80 or less you can BUY the book!)<br>  <br>  Go home and do it yourself.  You will not only get the light fixed, but you will get that warm and fuzzy feeling when you have done something new and done it correctly.<br>  <br>  If you dont want to do it.. stop by a local station and ask them how much to swap it out (bring the new bulb with you).  Prob. run you about $5 or $10 bucks and take about 5 minutes.<br>  <br>  .|`|gsjjiRGFaa	to replace the headlight bulb, you'll actually have to remove the assembly. this isn't overly difficult, but on the first try, i spent an hour & change. now i can do it in just a few minutes. this shop may be charging you so their guy can cut his teeth. beware & shop a bit.|`|EmgiGg17aa	Why did you not ask them first?

rkGInM3waa	I agree with Andy. The train is required to "stop and protect" that crossing. This is customarily done when there are no signals or the signals are malfunctioning.

M79W3Ct9aa	That's a problem on several GM engines including the 3800.  The primary cause is the DEXCOOL coolant that GM requires, although the stock gasket is pretty weak if you ask me.  Really is one of the few things that goes wrong with a well-maintained GM engine.  It cost me around 700 bucks or so to get it replaced on my 4.3 Vortec and I eventually replaced that entire engine because a lot of that leaking coolant got into my engine (it failed 100 miles from home, I had to drive back).  Replace with a stronger gasket and do it ASAP.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	That is a common problem on the 3800.  A new design to fix it is available at dealers and parts stores.  Several hundred dollars is a good deal, usually costs at least $800 or more at a good garage.

946109a893be7ef89b872c04100dd058aa	Did it have this problem before you did the head? If not you must have done the head installation wrong. If the mix is in the crankcase it is most likely a head gasket or head problem. If the mix is in the heat exchanger then it is in the oil cooler if equiped, or another area where the higher pressure of the oil would allow it to mix with water.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	Does it have a oil cooler or trans cooler which i doubt>Did you have the head mugufluxed for cracks> seems it has a problem or wrong head gasket> > Best get it fixed and change the oil before rust happens?|`|UqsLUzSiaa	It may already be too late for the engine.  Your problem indicates a head gasket problem.  It's either split or misaligned. You mentioned that the engine doesn't overheat so the likelihood of having a warped head is minimal.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, you may have to tear the engine down and make sure that there has been no damage due to water incursion.  Not many things will destroy an engine faster than water getting in where it doesn't belong.|`|c091b98d514f4c5fbaf36dcd50097effaa	Did you have the job done or do it yourself? <br>  <br>  A big mistake many shadetree mechanics make is that they fail to follow the manual for torque and alignment of parts.  If either is wrong, problems such as you have described will occur.  <br>  <br>  As others have mentioned the engine must be torn down immediately in order to minimize rusting and other damage resulting from water incursion.|`|3adsDss7aa	Don't over look that the block could have a hair line crack in it and when the engine heats up the crack could be expanding causing water to get into the oil.|`|54wgMlSFaa	youre head gasket is leaking.the water could be leaking down the sleeves (if it has em.some dont).maybe the sleeves didnt have enough protrusion to seal the bottom of the sleeve|`|4QpY1hLraa	assuming that the head was refitted properly another possibility is a cracked liner or a faulty mixing elbow
L4AnlPzvaa	I don't see them as being beneficial at all.  Yes, they are fast and highly maneuverable, but they often rely on relatively calm seas.  <br>  <br>  If you are speaking in terms of commerce, there will likely never be a more efficient, safe, and reliable method than container ships, tankers, bulkers, etc.|`|RqKh8ztQaa	no because they aren't very efficient modes of transportation and do not use fuel very economically so they would not be very useful int he future. The only neat thing about them is that they can traverse both land and water. Something that could fly efficiently would be more beneficial since there is also more space for movement in the air. Movement on the ground is steadily decreasing especially in cities (that's why they developed sky scrappers since they have no more space to expand horizontally)

The first A380 was delivered to Singapore Airlines on 15th October 2007, with five more delivered to the airline in 2008. Qantas received three A380s in 2008, and Emirates four - the most recent of which was delivered on the 30th December 2008 from the Airbus delivery centre in Hamburg, Germany. I'm not sure which airports operate it|`|0s8uOZHCaa	Yeah it's been in service since 2005 and different airlines use them such as Emirates Airlines, Qantas and Singapore Airlines.|`|GPtAQXZPaa	Yes,Singapore|`|zlPAVkUBaa	No, it's still in the planning stages.<br>  <br>  v/r Rip van Winkle|`|fkHBVn7taa	Current people flying with the A380 in commercial aviation <br>  <br>  Qantas -  two are flying -- but with recent issues with they're fuel bays MOLD they have grounded both for a week or so.  <br>  <br>  Singapore airlines - six are flying right now <br>  Enmities has a 3rd coming here in a week but has 2 right now <br>  Air France is coming up here pretty soon within weeks.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Yes, its been in service.

b2444f35a7f9696e20acbb1687b47466aa	Good question.  <br>  Hovercraft are used to cross the English Channel, and can carry large payloads. <br>  However, it could be that there are obstacles other than flat wide open water and ice. I don't know how well hovercraft can climb a hill. <br>  ======================================...|`|Pr51yi8vaa	the same reason that hovercrafts aren't use to cross the channel, because there is a better alternative, trucks are more mobile and alot cheaper to run, also to invest in a hover craft to use only for the ice season would be uneconomical as trucks can be used for other jobs on land for the whole year and cost alot less.<br>  no it isnt anything to do with newtons law because a truck will put the pressure of "30" tonnes on 8 wheels on the ice alot more direct and intense than a wide hovercraft skirt that expands over the whole size of the craft|`|dWrjTs1daa	Newtons laws-'for every force there is an equal and opposite'-in other words if the hovercraft and load weighs for arguments sake 30 tons-30 tons of downward force (directed at the ice!!) or thereabouts would be needed for it to 'hover'-so you gain nothing.|`|n1cePblaaa	Likely due to the fact that hovercraft cannot tow 80-90 tonnes that some of this equipment weighs..|`|AA12334360	it would still exert the same downward force but it would improve the load distribution but (a) cost too much to run and (b) be too unreliable and dangerous in case of failure|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Costs to run them, and let alone the extremely low temperatures for jet engines, and the fuel they would waste.
lwOGOlY7aa	Great car and has some room to mess with if you like to add power to that car. It is way better than a 2006 mustang gt. Stock it has less power but overall the infiniti is a better car.<br>  <br>  Make sure you drive it around a lil and see how you like it. The mustang will handle better but the infiniti should have a nicer ride.|`|imiUpi6Taa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure.

v8TWvtQgaa	The OEM tire size on all 4 corners was what ='ed to 225/70/14 <br>  <br>  Now myself to help with handling, daily useage, and performance. <br>  <br>  I would use a 255/60-15 out back and something like a 225/60-15 up front.<br>  <br>  Maybe even a 275/60-15 and 235/60-15 combo|`|AXNkmdbKaa	They don't look all that small but I would be running 225/70R15 all the way around.

3cf54b98aab3159bdd02ab505ad9368eaa	Well because of the mileage I assume you are talking about a NEW beetle (you should say which in your post).<br>  <br>  The new ones are not as durable as the old ones (which are 40 years old and STILL running !).  But someone made a point about the durability is a function of the OWNER as well as the car.  <br>  <br>  BUT.. if you can not see the ownership records, then for ANY car <br>  <br>  1)  Take it to an independent mechanic for an evaluation<br>  2)  Take it for a test drive <br>  3)  Look it up on consumer reports or a similiar review to see how that particular model is rated.<br>  <br>  Having done that.. if your cars are still all equal, I would likely go for the Honda..<br>  <br>  (But MY first choice would be the OLD beetle.. !)<br>  <br>  .|`|tcUXitYJaa	its kind of up to the owner, as in how well you take care of the car but there are VW's on the road from the 1940's - 1970's and there is Honda's/Toyota's on the road since the 70's or so. I'm assuming you are tlaking about the older ones and not the new beetle?|`|S4soZUFCaa	Any german car can't compete with Honda or Toyota. You can maintain as much as possible, most things that break will break because of design/materials.|`|RiQA4Epraa	my mom owns a 2000 beetle<br>  70k<br>  <br>  spent so much money on it<br>  just put in 2000 bucks within the last 10k|`|hE4CXKX2aa	Don't buy, I say again, don't buy.<br>  Go to a better place and buy a recently used car that has less mileage.  Why, well you will have more room to work with on miles and maybe service if it is from a actually dealer like chevy, ford, or places that are licenced to do such deals.    You will most likey need to finance it and so forth.  But buying a close to new or brand new car is better than buying an old POS that will cost you alot to upkeep.|`|bzvA7ZP4aa	I agree with the 1st answer. Any car can last say a million miles AS LONG YOU KEEP UP ON MAINTENANCE. the only reason most americans dump their cars after 150,000 miles is because they don't maintenance them and they turn to crap.<br>  my 91 jetta just had its engine rebuilt and runs great.<br>  my 82 bmw runs great also had its engine rebuilt<br>  my brothers 82 volvo runs great with an engine rebuild<br>  our suburban needs a new engine b/c we tow more than its recomended weight but other wise it runs good<br>  and so on...<br>  maintenance makes any car last.<br>  and if you want my biased opinion. any german is good. that country knows how to make some amazing cars. bmw is #1|`|EmgiGg17aa	Don't rightly know as you did not give any reference as to the year.   Check Consumers Reports as they do an unbiased comparison of all vehicles  from new and back 7 years.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	Totally irrelevant.<br>  <br>  The thing that matters when it comes to a vehicle's reliability/longevity is the OWNER.<br>  <br>  If you maintain it, it will last as long as you want. That means, regular services, not going cheap on things, etc.<br>  <br>  Don't maintain it, it won't.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, is it's just a machine, It doesn't come with built in reliability. It's just a collection of parts that require you to keep them in good shape.<br>  <br>  I've got two cars with close to 300,000 miles on them each. They run great. My father's car breaks down about once a month; just because he doesn't service it properly.
TCINOEX1aa	Hi There,<br>  <br>  First of all, I am so sorry to hear about troubles with Mercedes-Benz. For the record, not all dealers will put you through this sort of grief.<br>  <br>  I can honestly say that threatening to buy a BMW, go to MB corporate etc might get you what you want, but people working in dealerships are people too and human nature response to that would be to put them off side.<br>  <br>  The best advice I can offer is to go to the sales manager and give him details of your situation. Give them the dates and times and the conversations held and let them know that you are disappointed that your salesman is now requiring more money.<br>  <br>  Go in prepared, though. Check your OTP (Offer To Purchase) and check Vin#, Stock# and the costings of the vehicle including what you were supposed to pay and what those costs included. If the vehicle (with the extras) has the same details as the vehicle on your OTP and there is no mention of the extras, then you are 100% covered. This basically means that any extras that aren't listed but the vehicle has, are at no cost to you. <br>  <br>  If the vehicle listed on the OTP is a different vehicle, then ideally you could tell them that you will only accept that vehicle and if they cannot provide that vehicle, then your contract is NULL & VOID.<br>  <br>  If you do choose to go to MB Corporate I would advise not threatening it first. Just do it and wait for the dealership to contact you... Generally, when complaining to MB Corp, they will contact the dealership and force the dealership to deal with the complaint appropriately. <br>  <br>  Good Luck - I hope you get everything sorted with the dealership :)|`|KuWLNfYbaa	Why isn't it aligned properly.Has it had a bump and been repaired?These things do happen.Even if you don't think this is so.Go to the service manager and tell him your concerns and check his response.If he is unrelenting then go and speak to your trading standards officer.However if it is only a matter of minor cosmetic adjustment and you are being paranoid because it,s a new car then give the garage a chance to rectify matters.We are all human at the end of the day|`|AA12334360	the car "materially" does what they said it would do. Your perception of quality is just that - perception and not measured.<br>  <br>  the car is"fit for purpose", sorry but one of the above answers that says it isn't "fit" is wrong.<br>  <br>  You have to give them reasonable opportunity to fix it.<br>  <br>  I had a new car where i noticed a dent on the bonnet. I did'nt even get off the forecourt, i couldn't just reject the car, they had the right to fix it.|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	Your consumer rights mean that you can reject any product (within reason) if that product is not fit for the purpose it was designed for. Personally I'd take the car back, demand your money back (if they resist then All you have to do is pull up the relevant bit of legislation (speak to a legal representative about it). Then I would buy a car from a company that doesn't employ muppets that can't build cars!|`|APtZhqAGaa	Take the issue up immediately, before taking the car to the body shop, with customer service, Mercedes - Germany.|`|PPA30E8naa	tell them that|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	look up your contract/agreement you have with them,i believe they should take the car back and demand your money back on the basis that  they didn't provide you a car that was legal for road use,they will be very arsey about this if i was you i would demand a full refund if not ask for some extras they could comp you with|`|HJWVd3cgaa	?

M7G3MZb5aa	Your deashboard lights and your tail lights, or one of your tail lights are on the same circuit.<br>  <br>  In addition to the dashboard lights, and tail light bulbs, you also have a fuse for the circuit,  a switch/relay, that turns it on and off, and a dimmer knob/switch on your dashboard.<br>  <br>  1.  Check fuses for tail light/illumination circuit<br>  2.  Check bulbs.<br>  3.  Remove dimmer swicth and check resistance over terminals to detect a short in the potentiometer.<br>  4. check applicable switch/relay<br>  <br>  If all of that checks out ok, then you have a broken wire, or contacts on connecting harness somewhere arnt fully in contact.<br>  <br>  Another possibility is that you have a trailer harness installed, and it is shorting out your brake light circuit by bridging current accross the connector to your turn signals, brake lights and running lights causing the fuse to blow.  This may happen in snowy, conditions especially where salt was layed on the roads, because the trailer hitch plug is exposed, and salt/water is conductive.<br>  <br>  Its most likely the fuse, and even though you claim to have checked it, you may have missed, it so pull it out and check it again.|`|dVQdswtTaa	I'm not real familiar with the Cavalier but, <br>  <br>  Your tail lights and dash lights are on the same curcuit. This is so when your tail light circuit fails, you will know something's wrong because you have no dash lights.<br>  <br>  Double check the fuses, there may also be a relay in the circuit that turns on the lights when the switch is turned on, that will have to be checked also. <br>  <br>  Here's where it gets really bad. If the fuses and relays are okay, then it may be the body control module. It is a little computer that controls the interior power and lighting. If it is bad, you will have to replace it. <br>  <br>  Here is a picture of one from E-Bay to give you an idea:<a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/00-01-CHEVROLET-CAVALIER-BODY-CONTROL-MODULE-BCM-OEM_W0QQcmdZViewItemQQ_trksidZp3286Q2em20Q2el1116QQitemZ120380615457QQptZMotorsQ5fCarQ5fTruckQ5fPartsQ5fAccessories" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/00-01-CHE...</a><br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|lEqHoHxHaa	Either the taillight fuse is blown(this isn't always visible), or you have a bad wire or connection in the taillight circuit. They are wired on the same circuit so that you know you have an issue with your taillights.  try swapping the fuse with another of the same amperage rating.  If the fuse is bad, remember it blew for a reason.|`|Z6CJApzJaa	Maybe the wiring? Or the light adjuster on your column? Go to autozone or advance and see if they can do a diagnostics.|`|G5zN12dbaa	Sounds like the headlight switch on the dash has a problem.|`|IICFEIE0aa	Check your fuses again, you missed one|`|AA11105664	The only way that this can occur is if you have an open circuit between your battery and the lights. This is most commonly caused by a blown fuse. Use a multimeter on the Ohm/diode setting and see if there is a direct short, which means zero or minimal reading on the meter. <br>  <br>  According to how the car is wired, they may have put the bulbs in line in the circuit so that if one goes bad, you lose them all. This is horrible engineering if that is the case but I wouldn't put it past them to do this.<br>  <br>  The easiest way to deal with it is to go to a parts store and act befuddled. Tell them that you think you need a new bulb but your not sure and explain the problem. Odds are, someone there will go check the issue for you for free. Ego, parts sales and customer service all add up to an easy fix.
oTwymgpIaa	Taxes. As much as government would like you to believe it is the greed of big industry, it is not, it is because our government taxes oil to death, just like they have so blatantly done with tobacco, they just aren't so open about the oil because too many people would be outraged. ;-)|`|hMF3kg3Baa	because people are greedy.

Call you local congressperson and let them know that you want the oil companies to give a REAL accounting for the high gas prices, and you want the oil companies to be nationalized so they cant rip people off anymore.|`|51jR2Lmlaa	It takes a while for the prices to affect the pumps. They gas stations already bought a large supply of gas at a higher rate so they need to sell that before they can sell the cheaper stuff. Gas stations are very regulated, meaning they don't have a lot of control over what price they sell gas at plus there are so many stations around that they need to keep the prices consistent with everybody else to attract business.|`|26Qb0cUjaa	Oil price has absolutely nothing to do with what the consumer pays|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	because big oil is organized crime|`|6LdCn0YPaa	the oil companies hate us ... they don't want us to be happy with cheap gas

It is just time consuming. I have yet to hear of a professional body shop respraying anything even with no damage for less than a couple hundred, especially if you want it to look right.|`|AA10620246	The repair is going to cost a good bit, especially since it is a late model Volvo. Someone backed into my truck (a 2006 Ranger) last Thanksgiving, and just made a dent in the rear fender. The paint wasn't scratched, and the metal wasn't creased. It was just a simple dent. That dent cost $700 to repair. Any body shop will remove the bumper to fix the scratches, and they will probably replace the plastic part.I imagine the repairs on your friend's car will cost $500-800.

I tested them with a meter and they are still working fine!  So I never replaced them, and car car still runs fine and still working at 168.583 miles and still gets good gas mileage. Do you notice any difference in the way yours is running? You can have them replaced with ones you buy on-line but make Sure they are for Your car. Just make sure that who ever looks at it shows you on there scanner they are not working. They should fluctuate between 0.3 & 0.8 volts when running at normal operating temp of the engine. I hope this will help you some, Good Luck Emily. :^)|`|G5zN12dbaa	Go to local Autozone and have them check the ECU codes.

gEw83TRTaa	First thing, yea, you gotta repair it.  There really is not a lot of choice on that one.<br>  <br>  Second - get some more estimates.  There are plenty of places you can get a used engine that is still in good shape WAY under that number.  Finding a qualified mechanic to replace it other than the dealer is a good idea too.  I dont know where you live, but I know I can get a used engine, and have it swapped into that van for about $2500 here.<br>  <br>  Shop around - get other estimates and opinions - then repair the van and drive it til it drops.|`|AA11914369	I'm not sure what you are asking here.  One really has nothing to do with the other.  Cars break, and need to be fixed sometimes.  You still owe the lender for the money you borrowed, no matter what.  The contract doesn't allow you to stop paying if the car breaks after all.<br>  <br>  And not being fixed you couldn't even think about selling it for anything close to what you still owe on it.<br>  <br>  You don't have much choice, you need to keep making the payments due or your credit will take a tremendous hit if they  have to repossess the vehicle.  And you also need something to drive, so decide if you want to fix what you have and are paying for with around $7 grand cash, or buy something else for about that same amount which would almost have to be smaller and not meet your needs.<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, I wish you well.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	First thing I would do is make sure about the extent of the damage done to the engine, and get more quotes from reputable shops capable of doing the repairs. You are "on the hook" to repay the amount of the original loan. You won't be any better off by trying to trade in this non-running vehicle on something else. Check to see if the shop could take payments for the work. Good luck.

TCINOEX1aa	Hi There,<br>  <br>  First of all, I am so sorry to hear about troubles with Mercedes-Benz. For the record, not all dealers will put you through this sort of grief.<br>  <br>  I can honestly say that threatening to buy a BMW, go to MB corporate etc might get you what you want, but people working in dealerships are people too and human nature response to that would be to put them off side.<br>  <br>  The best advice I can offer is to go to the sales manager and give him details of your situation. Give them the dates and times and the conversations held and let them know that you are disappointed that your salesman is now requiring more money.<br>  <br>  Go in prepared, though. Check your OTP (Offer To Purchase) and check Vin#, Stock# and the costings of the vehicle including what you were supposed to pay and what those costs included. If the vehicle (with the extras) has the same details as the vehicle on your OTP and there is no mention of the extras, then you are 100% covered. This basically means that any extras that aren't listed but the vehicle has, are at no cost to you. <br>  <br>  If the vehicle listed on the OTP is a different vehicle, then ideally you could tell them that you will only accept that vehicle and if they cannot provide that vehicle, then your contract is NULL & VOID.<br>  <br>  If you do choose to go to MB Corporate I would advise not threatening it first. Just do it and wait for the dealership to contact you... Generally, when complaining to MB Corp, they will contact the dealership and force the dealership to deal with the complaint appropriately. <br>  <br>  Good Luck - I hope you get everything sorted with the dealership :)|`|0449992e5db7c419a2aed6504f012c08aa	I cant answer mate but i have an interesting story that happened to me. I bought a brand new astra vxr ( not quite a merc!) and had it a year before trading it in. Several weeks later i got a call from a garage (not vauxhall) saying they had my car to sell on, and they asked me if i had been in any major accidents. I hadn't and told them that the car was as new. Apparently they had shone some sort of UV light over the paintwork and noticed that the rear end had been extensively resprayed. I was shocked and could offer no explanation to the chap. He then said that it wouldn't be the first time he had heard about a brand new car being damaged in transit and then a botched job done of the repair, just so the customer gets his car on time. I couldn't believe it. Just goes to show you the corners they cut in the name of a sale.

AA10255483	This is not a difficult repair, if you have the proper tools, ie air compressor, impact gun, a big hammer, and probably a 35mm impact socket.  In order to replace the hub and bearing, which is serviced as one unit, you need to first remove the wheel, the brake caliper and mounting brack, the rotor, disconnect the tie rod from the knuckle, remove the lower ball joint nut, separate the lower control arm from the knuckle, remove the axle shaft retaining nut(this is the part where if you don't have an impact gun, 35mm socket, and an air compressor, you will have a very hard time).  Next grab your bfh and pound on the end of the axle shaft to get it to come out of the hub.  be careful not to damage the threads on the end of the axle shaft or you won't be able to get the nut started.  sometimes you can spin the nut on a few threads and hit the nut instead of the end of the axle shaft.  I've actually had to cut a 1/4" off the end of the threads and start over.  There are 3 bolts that hold the hub onto the knuckle.  Remove those and disconnect the abs wheel speed sensor connecter.|`|IJduG1Nyaa	Well if you haven't done this before then I would suggest to take it to a shop it will be worth the money! <br>  If you really want to do this your self then go out to the public library and get a Chilton's manual and follow the instructions.

CUI8tL8saa	I do agree that the A5 is DROP DEAD GORGEOUS! I especially like those racing seats Audi has been putting in their latest S models, like the S6 and S5. However, I may have to side with the A4 on this one only because I am a sedan type of guy. Sedans are more classy and practical whereas the coupe style on the A5 screams sport. That doesn't mean that the A5 isn't classy though, you can easily imagine a sophisticated guy getting out of this car in Monte Carlo wearing a Prada suit. It would be an extremely close duo though if I had to choose just one, so if I ever came across the money, I would just have to get both to suit my mood of the day :)|`|pGP3gKSOaa	Love them both, in S Line and 'S' versions.<br>  <br>  My next car would be A5 Coupe 2.0 TFSI (211) S Line.

rBATSpC5aa	Because of its lower pricing and longer list of available options, Honda considered the new Civic Si to be a more viable choice for performance minded young men, who were the most common buyers of RSXs<br>  <br>  Basically, the car was marketed to people who liked performance. But, for a way lesser price tag, they could get a Civic Si with around the same performance and different options, so people went for that.<br>  <br>  Then, when Acura was expanding, they deicded that the RSX wasn't a viable alternative to the Si because of the latter's price, mostly, and it was replaced with the TSX.|`|N4qbp3vNaa	I had one for a while.

KZC1hdBXaa	Since your brakes get hot (can get REAL HOT) if you drove throught water with them theres a better % chance that your rotors can get warped if that happens you'd have to get either all new rotors or rotors to the side that got warped...rotors aren't to expensive about $25-30 dollars for the average car|`|wpgRMjgraa	Yes it could.............the colder wet water can hit the hotter brake rotors and in some cases warp them, its always best to drive slowly through standing water...|`|DV4xyeChaa	not really...maybe hard to stop when you come out of the water but should be ok in 5 to 30 secounds...no lasting damage.|`|KtQdOqHKaa	Due to the way brakes work, it's very unlikely that the brakes themselves would be affected by going through water (unless you try to brake while you are still in the water, then it's most likely that the car will aquaplane).  If for some reason the rotors are still wet when you go to apply the brakes, the friction and the heat caused by said friction will dry them off probably within about a meter.|`|03fiqGJwaa	The answer is no.  Now if your brake pads, shoes, rotors or drums get wet then they will cease to work properly until they dry off, which should only be a few seconds.<br>  <br>  Rotors will NOT "warp" if submerged in water while hot. Rotors seldom "warp" at all. Rather, this so-called "warping" is actually deposits left from brake pads.|`|jM6xUrrRaa	If you are worried about the brakes after going through standing water, you should GENTLY press them after the water to dry them out before continuing on, just incase you do need to brake hard a little way down the road.|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	if your brake is not a disc brake yes but the old model usually a brake drum yes it will ruin your brake temporarily|`|8OnSOfCXaa	Greetings Judy, <br>  No you won't ruin your brakes but they won't work properly until they've dried out. If it's safe to do so, i.e. no traffic close to you gently apply your brakes  a few times to clear water from the discs & pads. Your brakes should then work as normal.<br>  <br>  Don't do what I did many years ago and go too quickly through deep water or you'll suck in water via the air intake and wreck your engine. Yes it was expensive.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|leM6fQRmaa	If the rotors are hot, they can warp when they cool down too fast
1bYITsABaa	tkauestion is right.Keep the vehicle running, because your thermostat opened and the engine is taking in more water. BTW, you won't have to let any water out. It will be just fine|`|4fe4fa0093052951c5515ef2f32cefffaa	Where did you put in the coolant?  Into the radiator or the overflow tank?<br>  <br>  Typically, putting in too much will result in overflowing when hot and stink because it will burn on the hot engine.  But, usually, it does no real harm.  The pressure cap will regulate the pressure just the same.<br>  <br>  Please be aware, anti-freeze is highly toxic.  If it overflows and pets lick enough amount, it will kill them.<br>  <br>  I'm somewhat confused when you said, "I started the car and it went down."  That means you have air trapped in the system.  You might want to let it run for a while and see what happens.  It may "burp" itself out to the correct level.  Otherwise, you might want to remove the excess, just to be on the safe side.

Sell the short ram on Ebay to some dumbass.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	Your vehicles currently have a cold air intake.<br>  <br>  Go take a look at your intake piping.

EmgiGg17aa	Yup.  The mechanic just wanted extra work.   You will be back with a broken hydraulic system pump.  You do that in emergency situations.  It is not meant to stay in there.   The whole system has to be flushed out and cleaned.  that means parts taken apart and washed clean of oil.  Brake fluid(hydraulic fluid is not oil).   Oil will harden seals and neoprene causing them to leak even more.  Also oil is corrosive to  flexible hoses and they will crack.  Oil will also burn.|`|AA10191024	I'm no hydraulics expert, but I've learned over the years that doing things like this (cutting corners to save a buck) usually has a bad outcome.<br>  <br>  Motor oil has certain additives specifically designed for auto engines, is not designed to be pressurized to the levels hydraulic systems need.<br>  <br>  I say: clean, flush the system, install new HYDRAULIC oil, and hope you haven't caused any damage.|`|dNrR8sJGaa	Hydraulic oil is only 10 weight the heavier viscocity will blow the seals and eventually ruin it|`|54wgMlSFaa	it should be flushed and new filters put on.the regular oil cause gunk and deposits to get into all the parts.it also causes carbon to build up.and it breaks down with the temps that hydraulics reach.flush it and put the correct oil in it and new filters

And chrysler doesn't like Fram either for filters, I have found the factory filter works the best and you can try Wix.<br>  And a little note on the oil. People complain about the engine burning oil. The factory and what they taught me at the Chrysler  Ontario, Calif training center is that it is normal for all gas chrysler engines to use 1 quart of oil every 750 miles. That is for every 99 and older gas engine. From '99 and current I don't know, don't work for chrysler anymore<br>  Hope this helps

AA10164889	It is a complex process that varies considerably from one locomotive to another.  For a simple locomotive that has a hand operated water pump, the first thing you do is pump up the water in the boiler to the correct level on the sight glass.  Others may have a fitting to allow you to add water through the blowdown pipe from a hose.<br>  <br>  When you have the right amount of water in the boiler, you pre-heat the firebox with a propane torch.  Just light your torch and use it to heat all the interior surfaces of the firebox until the backhead is almost too hot to touch.<br>  <br>  Next open the cylinder cocks and light the fire.  This varies widely depending on the fuel used.  Some burn coal, some burn oil or alcohol, and some burn butane or propane gas.  Get the fire going and keep an eye on the steam pressure gauge.<br>  <br>  Make sure the pop valve opens at the right pressure, and then reduce the heat of the fire to a running fire.  Test the whistle and other appliances, and you are ready to roll.  This applies very generally to most locomotives.  The one you are working with may be different.  So check with someone who is familiar with the engine.<br>  <br>  Remember to close the cylinder cocks after clearing off.|`|CGr6EtRUaa	Methinks you are dealing with a coal-fired loco so first of all, you need to make sure the boiler tubes are clear. Open the fire door and the smokebox door and look down the boiler. Any obstruction in the tubes should be cleared by using a tube brush - spiral metal spokes on the end of a long rod.<br>  <br>  Check the smokebox for ash residues. Any remaining must be removed by a miniature shovel or a spoon.<br>  <br>  Now as our last contributor says, check the boiler water level. This will show in the glass. If the glass is empty then operate the pump until it is about 1/2 - 2/3 full.<br>  <br>  Edit: check that the lubricator and oil pots are topped up.<br>  <br>  To start the fire: pieces of charcoal soaked in paraffin. Into the firebox, then when that is well alight, pieces of crushed coal.<br>  <br>  Watch the pressure gauge. Typically, a 7.25" loco should have a working pressure of around 90 psi.<br>  <br>  A suction fan attached to the chimney will assist the draft as the loco fires up. Normally these are powered by a 12 v battery.<br>  <br>  When you have full steam the safety valve will lift, then it is a matter of topping up the boiler with water and keeping the fire going to maintain that head of steam.<br>  <br>  It is a matter of skill to learn how to control the loco using regulator and cut-off, speed versus load versus momentum.<br>  <br>  When your session is over you still have the task of blowing down (i.e. emptying the excess water and steam from the boiler), cleaning the smokebox and raking out and cleaning the ash pan.<br>  <br>  One more thing: if you are intending to haul members of the public you must have a boiler certificate, proof of test by a qualified engineer.<br>  <br>  Do you love steam engines? I do!<br>  <br>  Edit: LOL, why the thumbs down? I've driven and maintained a 7.25" loco and all above I write from experience. If you're cross because I left out the bit about oiling round and the ticket, why not say so?

AA12261615	id also check the fuel pump relay on it when its the idle air control solenoid they will give a warning when they start to get dirty or need replaced,if the fuel pump relay is failing on though it wont give no warnings at all,they go bad all the sudden and even though you can hear the pump running doesn't mean its staying kicked in when it should be,and the throttle position sensor will cause one to do whats yours is doing also,yours sounds like an aic or a bad throttle position sensor gone bad in it,these are just guesses at what it may be, have the computer scanned to see if it will give any trouble codes, this will help you more than i can tell you ,good luck.|`|N7LlOAcOaa	yeah the idle air control valve is cheap and a cheap fix.

XsZsk55Jaa	Actually it is an excellent idea which would save lives.  It doesn't need to be a full face helmet which is what the other responders speaking about reduced visibility and hearing are referring to.  Just a bicycle or skateboard helmet would be a big lifesaver.  Airbags are great but people still die of head injuries in a collision.  A helmet would  add some extra protection. I wouldn't mind seeing 5 point harnesses either.  <br>  <br>  The reason car drivers don't wear helmets is the same reason many don't wear seat belts; they think it can't happen to them.

CGr6EtRUaa	Here's a rough guide:<br>  <br>  Steam:<br>  Iron and steel for the frames and superstructure. Wrought iron or steel plate for the frames, and high-grade steel for the boiler.<br>  <br>  Copper and brass for the pipes, fittings, etc.<br>  <br>  Diesel, electric:<br>  Steel for the frames and bogies, pressed steel or possibly aluminium for the outer body shell, fine grade steel for the mechanisms, copper for the electric wiring<br>  <br>  Railways revolutionised transport and transformed society, making journeys over long distances much shorter and opening up markets for goods in ways that could never have been possible in the age of horse transport. Locomotives were the engines that powered this transformation.<br>  <br>  Pollution. Steam locomotives generate smoke and combustion gases, and in the early years of railways many people protested against this. Similarly, a diesel train generates exhaust fumes. However with the advent of road transport many people have realised that trains, forwarding a given number of passengers or load of goods, generate less pollution than road transport.<br>  <br>  Effect on the landscape. Once the railway had been established, the landscape would never be the same again. Massive earthworks, tunnels and bridges transformed the look of the countryside and towns and cities alike. Coal mines and foundries sprang up everywhere to feed the insatiable appetite of the railways for fuel and materials.<br>  <br>  That's why it was called, 'The Industrial Revolution'.|`|2dacea660561bddc5e448a614dd7f5efaa	Sounds like a homework assignment to me... ;-)<br>  <br>  My best suggestion is go to Wikipedia and start there.

lwOGOlY7aa	The yz125, kx125, and cr125 are great bikes if you haven't been riding for very long. If you are strong and looking for more power use a yzf series bike.  2 strokes are nice for power but eat up a crap load of gas. Dont look at bikes older than 2000 unless you know how to work on them and you are tight on money.<br>  For your height and size the 125's will work the best but you can get a bigger bike if you know how to ride, and ride well.<br>  <br>  Most 2 strokes dont work the best for offroading like in dense areas where there is a lot of up hill and loose gravel or dirt because they have a lot of power and tend to kick the back end out.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have good tires will a good amount of grip. 2 strokes are made mainly for tracks but the 125's seem to work the best all around in offroading and tracks.|`|dSzUaxpcaa	I would go Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki, Kawasaki, or KTM. Look for bikes that don't have a lot of modifications such as race suspension or big bore motors. Stay away from bikes that have been raced. Also I wouldn't suggest a bike that has had a recent top end rebuild. That means they have ridden it hard and if they are selling it after the repair means the rebuild wasn't too good.|`|moLMPoVqaa	YZ250 will not disappoint! I'm 6'7" at 250lbs.

If you will be riding any trails a 125 is a bad choice and depending on how good of a rider you are a 125 might not be the best choice for motocross either. These bikes can be a little tricky to ride if you do not have experience. A 250 2 stroke is much easier to ride than a 125. If you will be just riding MX and feel you are aggressive enough to keep a 125 wound up it would be a fine choice. If you are just riding woods a KTM 2 stroke woods bike like the 200 or 250 XC/EXC (depending on the year) or if you can find a Kawasaki KDX200 or 220 any of these bikes would be awesome for woods riding. The YZ 250 is a great all around machine. It works good for motocross or woods riding.|`|wdecGP36aa	Hello well id get a yz125 or kx125 or cr125 or sx125 just get a mate who has a bit of experience with motorcycles and get him to look over it i wouldnt get anything older than 2003

qGpD9ntNaa	No cold air intakes are a scam they do not give you any more power or any better gas mileage than a stock air intake. The only thing that will change is the truck will be louder because you will be able to hear all the air getting sucked into the intake. They are a complete waste of money. The filters do not flow any better than a good wix air filter. and most every car made in the last 20 years comes factory with a cold air intake they have air duct that suck air from outside the engine compartment which strangely enough is something that most cold air intakes do not do. Spend the money on a good ignition upgrade you will be much happier with the results.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK
Yjzbh3sKaa	I just did this replacement on my 1999 Forester. The device you're looking<br>  for is mounted very high up on the front wall of the area under the dash<br>  about six inches to the left of the steering column. It lives between a<br>  couple of others. I had to remove/loosen quite a few other components, as<br>  well as lay upside down in the driver's seat with my head on the floormat,<br>  in order to access the flasher.  Its sometimes called a flasher relay, its black and small and has three prongs, some have four.  Any auto parts store will sell you one for around/less than $5 and they can look up the one you need!!<br>  <br>  It was my experience that actuating the hazard lights button would get a<br>  single click out of the flasher relay. I could then identify the correct<br>  part by touch while using my free hand to repeatedly actuate the hazard<br>  button.<br>  <br>  I finally found it and, after removing the<br>  keyless entry box (rectangular, flat box about 6x3 inches) I was able<br>  to remove the plug from the flasher with no problem. Took me less than<br>  20 minutes to disassemble, replace and reassemble, even though it took<br>  me several hours of just searching for that little black box. I didn't<br>  bother removing the old piece.<br>  <br>  The flasher was to the left of the steering column and directly behind<br>  the fuse panel. I had to remove the keyless entry box to see it, but,<br>  then, it was in plain sight. I had to go buy a long shank 10mm socket<br>  to remove the keyless entry box, since my short socket didn't work.<br>  With just a little knowledge, it was an easy job. <br>  <br>  I was not able/willing to go through the difficult process of removing the<br>  original part. I was able to remove the connector from it and run that down<br>  and install the replacement flasher on its end. I then tied it down to<br>  other non-moving components to avoid rattle.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Apparently, Subaru is calling this module something else - perhaps a GEM or Generic Electronic Module or some other weird name. <br>  If you know the location of the module, the Subaru parts department should be able to pull up a picture.|`|7QpKAanBaa	Sounds like Eric F knows what hes talking about good job.
XLXncQu9aa	I see your point here.  I believe that if you are going to obey the law, you should obey all of it.  You can't be a complete driver if you observe some laws and ignore others.  Its either do everything correct or don't do it at all.  As it relates to running stop signs, I believe many don't speed through stop signs because they realize that speeding through stop signs would almost certainly involve an accident.  Cars usually are awaiting each person that stops at a stop sign.  If you blow through one, then you are likely to broad side someone causing a major accident.  However, the same can be said for speeding in general.  There have been driver's I have seen that have blown right through red lights.  Red lights are similar to stop signs with the exception that you must wait until the light is green to go, unless you have a "turn right on red" sign.  Anyway, my point is speeding in general can cause an accident and you should obey every aspect of the law.  Both speeding and blowing through stop signs is wrong.  Every driver should observe each law as it is, and not try to make it convenient for themselves.  But the penalty will be an increase in fines and accidents.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	red light is a more serious issue.|`|VYHcYB4yaa	because a stop sign is there to control traffic when there's a potential conflict,  a speed limit is a guide for traffic to safely drive on that particular road.  Would you like someone to blow off a stop sign and cause an accident?  How don't you get it?  It's not about the law as much as it is common sense and how the public carries itself.  Why don't you ask the police  why they don't ticket every car if every car breaks the speed limit for that matter?  You are being rediculious.|`|JKQhSGEEaa	i stop at stop signs because i dont want to get slammed by another car and it only takes 3 sec's to look. i do speed anywhere from 5-15mph over the speed limit and im not afraid of getting a fine cause i got a great radar detector that has been working for 3 years and never let me down. i speed cause im a great driver and if you are doing the speed limit at 55mph and everyone else is at 70 you are putting yourself more in danger that everyone else that is doing 70|`|03fiqGJwaa	Excellent point. Why the hell would someone break the law to supposedly get to where they're going quicker, then stop at a stop sign, when no one is coming??? It's borderline schizophrenic, seriously.<br>  <br>  I speed. I do not stop at stop signs unless someone is coming or I see, or detect, a cop nearby. Occasionally I will run a red light that is pointless to stop at.<br>  <br>  I will also pass in the turning lane, over double lines and sometimes go around someone at a red light, then run the red light.<br>  <br>  If you're gonna do it, do it right.<br>  <br>  However, it could be that they're just spaced out on their cellphone not paying attention to anything else and don't realize they're speeding.  That is the less fun, entertaining answer but probably closer to the truth.|`|2VVU7gNfaa	There's a difference in danger between going 8-10mph over the speed limit when everyone else is also going 8-10mph over the speed limit and travelling in the same direction and running a stop sign where people are crossing your path perpendicularly, even though both are obviously illegal.<br>  <br>  "Moderate" speeding doesn't usually kill anyone if everyone else is going about the same speed and the road conditions are good, even if it is illegal.  Running a stop sign has a much greater potential to injure/kill other drivers and/or yourself because if you do hit someone while running a stop sign chances are you'll be hitting someone going perpendicular to the direction you're travelling in and they won't be moving nearly as fast as you are when you hit them.    <br>  <br>  I don't think most people are worried about fines for speeding because although once in a while you might get caught and get ticketed, most of the time you won't get caught especially if everyone else is going the same speed you are.  It's a lot easier for a police officer to pick out one car running a stop sign (since so few people run them compared to the number of people who speed) than it is for a police officer to pick out one person speeding from everyone else speeding.|`|0K4ylh5Uaa	It's not how fast you drive but how you drive fast. Keep that in mind. Speeding per se is not inherently unsafe. Where you speed is the problem. Going 35 in a school zone posted at 20 with kids present is not the same as doing 80 on an interstate posted at 65. Which do you consider more unsafe...driving 40 on that 65 MPH highway in traffic or speeding at 80 with no traffic? Running a stop sign is worlds apart from speeding. The consequences of breaking one traffic law are not the same as breaking another one. Don't you agree? Not everything is black and white.|`|QfIxlKAjaa	Choosing to speed (Driving well above the limit) and stopping at stop signs is not so much about the cost of the fine. People seldom think of the monetary penalties when choosing either of these. Be it a stop sign, railroad track, traffic light etc. This is a conscious decision based on risk vs consequence. Its called behavior or at risk behavior. here is why, on a daily basis, people speed, this is primarily due to the fact that we are either following the traffic flow an patterns on the feeways or country roads. Therefore, we evaluate the risk of either keeping up with the flow where the risk would seem to be at its lowest for accidents, and certainly even less for a violation or we slow down to the posted limit and perceive that this is dangerous because other drivers impatience will cause me to have an accident or they will cause an accident. so the risk is low and the consequences are low for this type of speeding.<br>  Now, about stop signs. Risk vs consequence? we dramatically change or behavior when it comes to stop signs (well at least most of us do). The risk and consequence for not stopping at the stop signs or intersections are much greater. the risk of accident is great and the consequences are or can be extreme (death). Our ability to evoke fear within our behavior is primal. so the bottom line here is Risk vs consequence. the higher the risk-consequence, the more no risk behavior. Slow down and stop to think.
zhJOZhKEaa	*Any* passenger is said to be 30% more likely to be injured or killed in the front seat.*<br>  <br>  There is an excellent chart on page four of this document: <a href="http://www.chop.edu/traumalink/download/2005/pcps_cpsrprt_05.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.chop.edu/traumalink/download/...</a><br>  Showing the statistics for children under age 16 with different seating positions and types of restraint from a recent study.  The article alongside verifies that up until at least age 13, children are much safer in the back seat in an appropriate restraint for their size and age.<br>  <br>  In fact, at age 8 many children do not yet pass the '5 step test' to safely fit in an adult seatbelt.  Your daughter may very well need a booster seat!<br>  <br>  The 5-Step Test. <br>  <br>  1. Does the child sit all the way back against the auto seat? <br>  2.

Is the lap belt as low as possible, touching the thighs? <br>  5. Can the child stay seated like this for the whole trip?<br>  <br>  If you answered "no" to any of these questions, your child needs a booster seat to make both the shoulder belt and the lap belt fit right for the best crash protection.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|31Ttgqlbaa	You are right, 11 or 12 is the age that they can start sitting in the front sit.

There will likely be one in under the dash and one under the hood.

pTSk4O8Aaa	the RS cars are Audi's hyped up cars!!! Audi only produce one RS model at a time due to them being so powerful. like the RS6 has just replaced the RS4. you can no longer buy a brand New RS4 from the factory!! the S versions of Audi cars are the slightly less powerful cars of the RS. The only reason car magazines compare the BMW's and Merc's to Audi's S range is because the power output of the RS cars are way over the top of the M3/M5/C amg/E amg. like an Audi RS6 has 572BHP, the Audi S6 has only 485BHP. now the M5 has 507BHP, and the AMG E-class also has 507BHP, if you think about it, the S6's stats are closer to the M5/E AMG stats. <br>  <br>  You only buy a Audi RS car if you either have loads of cash and want  a fast, big car, or, if you want to out run anyone prancing around a ugly BMW M3/M5. and make them look like a fool!!!!|`|S01zIagOaa	The RS4 and RS6 are not really in a league of their own performance wise. BMW's M's and MB's AMG are in the same league.<br>  <br>  Audi and MB can not tough the handling of the BMW's.Mercedes Benz AMG cars are basically German hotrods and tough to beat in a straight line. Audi's fall somewhere in betwen.|`|tKWwZpOAaa	The RS series are made to compete with the M and AMG series since its clear the S series doesn't. Older RS variants were similar in performance to the M and AMG class, however its just recently that audi has been producing these cars with massive power that out-preform the competition as you noted. Im guessing the S-line is there for people who dont have the money for a RS.|`|RRw1bpI5aa	The RS models compete directly with the M and AMG models. Few years ago the S models could compete with the M and AMG models but the horsepower wars between the big three german companies have changed the lineups. The RS6 might just be the last edition to the horsepower war because now that all brands are focused on efficiency instead of pure horsepower. The M brand has always been the most agile and driver oriented while the RS is considered the allrounder.|`|g24NZnjNaa	Yes. The S-models are suppose to have a performance edge over the regular BMW and Mercedes cars. The new S4 has 330hp, but an equivilant bmw 335xi has 300hp. The RS models compare to the AMG and M models. Some cars like the S8 can compare, and the S6 isn't too bad, but it all depends..here is a list....<br>  <br>  RS4<br>  <br>  M3<br>  C63 AMG<br>  <br>  RS6<br>  <br>  M5<br>  E63 AMG|`|784fbac22b2c480483b2cedc7dbbf3ebaa	I think the RS is a low volume car so most car magazines do not do comparisons on them.

lwOGOlY7aa	Best way is to add a cold air intake it will boost performance and makes that car burn that fuel nice. Also a turbo or supper-charger is great if you tend to spend a good amount of money. A super will look better than a turbo but one thing is a turbo is FREE power while a super takes power to make power. A good engine chip changing the fuel mix and output can always bump up your ride to a higher level and you can always change it to get the perfect match that you want. A replacement of the stock cams and through on a performance header and exhaust will make that pony sound like it is a muscle car and not just a pony car.<br>  <br>  If you want to go from cheapest to most money it would go like this.<br>  1.

f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	Well, first off the police do not determine fault unless they witnessed the accident first hand. Second you have an independent witness that backs your story (worth their weight in gold). If the other driver does not have an independent witness to back them up (or a photo from a red light camera) then they are going to be 100% at fault.|`|2BrVDPa8aa	That is crazy.  I had something very similar happen to me when I was 21.  I was in the middle of the intersection waiting to turn left.  The light turned yellow and I still couldn't go , I started to go since it was clear and as I started to turn it was red, and just as I thought I cleared the intersection, this lady smacked right in to me.  She told the officer the light was yellow and he actually cited her.  He told her that yellow means slow down and stop, not to go through or try to go through.  If she would have been in the middle of the intersection while it would have turned yellow, she would have been okay.  We went to court after I sued her, and she lost.  For the reason of her going through a yellow light instead of slowing down to stop for red.  Plus I had a witness.<br>  Good luck|`|AA11914369	If the light was yellow before you entered the intersection, you are guilty of running a red light.

sbxSdcZEaa	Hey Max it's best not to connect the speakers you removed, the purpose is to get a good front stage meaning you want the sound to be focus like it's  right in front of you. Make sure the rear is used for fill to give you that wrap around experience. On the amps you install make sure you use the electronic crossovers set the door and rear on high pass filter I would set the crossover point around 100hz and the sub amp on low pass at the same Hz freq. One big flaw with audio systems is mixing up different speakers brands. You want your front and rear speakers to be the same maker that way it will sound balanced, and if you add sub don't get subs that are to big,  the largest I would go is 12 in dia. because the larger you go say 15 to 18in. the sub will only produce really low end around 20- 50hz  you want balance  bass note in songs are usually between 50-150hz. anyway  unless you are listening to bass music you can go down in the 30hz range you don't even hear it, just feel it. good luck|`|8n3NvYQwaa	No but unless you had them right next to your ears you probably would not hear them....   Grant M|`|MUaUMAycaa	All depends, I would not hook up front door speakers with the sub also. I would put the sub on an amp. & hook up the speakers else where with new wiring. I don't know how many speakers your supposed to have, but just don't hook it with the sub.|`|EMC7JwVBaa	You don't need to complicate things. Use either the sub or the old speakers. Also, if the  old speakers aren't "up to snuff" the whole system will suffer- you only have to have one bad speaker to make things sound bad.

WMnaQaJiaa	SDI means "stratified diesel injection", which is basically the non-turbo normally aspirated diesel from VW.<br>  <br>  Legendary engine.|`|mKVFIklaaa	As above, the SDi is the standard, non turbo diesel. Good car, but look out for a full service history: They need regular cam belt changes, and find a good local independent garage to do your servicing - a VW dealer will charge up to ￡800 for a cam belt & tensioner renewal, many garages will do this for around ￡250.<br>  The biggest problem is the price: As a private sale with 105k in first class condition with a service history, the car's worth ￡1,150. Don't pay over the odds, there are thousands of used cars for sale. It's the base model too, so use that to haggle. Personally, I'd go for the 'E' or 'SE' model unless the seller will drop to a reasonable price.|`|sR8mN143aa	SDI means that there is no turbo or special injection: Its a normal engine.<br>  <br>  It is a very reliable car, but the mileage is quite high for such a car, a usual 'run around car'. As said above, they do need regular attention with the cam belt.<br>  <br>  ￡1500 is quite steep, and the top book for this is around ￡1000. A polo is the mystery for me though.<br>  <br>  If you want a polo, then go for the 1.6 diesel, it will be as potent, but more frugal and easier on the insurance and tax, especially with the new tax bands.  The high mileage will mean that the engine would be knackered and the emmisions high. <br>  <br>  If you want a 1.9 diesel, go for a Passat or a Golf.  Exactly the same engine, and they are better, more comfortable car. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and you should get a 2001 Passat or Golf  for about ￡2000 with about 90,000miles|`|X16keVc1aa	It is a normal diesel injection engine.<br>  <br>  I would not worry too much about buying a diesel car with 105K.

If your car uses Distributor-less Ignition than your ignition module is probably bad its what controls your ignition system and it sends voltage to the coils telling them when to fire. It controls when to advance or retard the ignition. If your car does have a distributor than I would look for an oil leak around the distributor oil is not conductive and it will kill your electrical connection. Their is a gasket that is at the base of the distributor and it prevents oil from riding up the distributor and getting on the points.

jMqaBDdWaa	An accident investigator or forensic engineer should be able to determine that, had the truck stopped, it would not have done that much damage to your car.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	By the damages to your car, if the truck hit you at a fast speed, then he should be at fault. Basically if the truck stopped at the stop sign and then proceed to move starting at say 15 mph and speeding up, then there wouldn't be that much damage. If the force of impact forced your car that far of a distance (in a parking lot), then it sounds like he was going fast enough to do that and it's unlikely he stopped at the stop sign. I hope that the location of where your car ended up was in the police report. Basically without witnesses, accidents at 4 way stops or traffic light intersections are hard to prove who's at fault because both drivers can claim they had the right of way. <br>  <br>  And if he had this same insurance for say 20 years and you've been only using this insurance company for a few years, that may not be good for you. I don't know if insurance companies would likely believe a long time customer or not, but you see where I'm going. <br>  <br>  Insurance companies normally do their own investigation of determining fault. They should look at the damage to your car and his truck to determine if his truck was moving at a fast speed to do that damage. And also don't forget to mention where your car ended up after the accident and be firm with what happen.|`|BUPiXrxVaa	The fact that you both have the same insurance company is a very, very important fact that you almost left out. <br>  <br>  Since the same insurance company will have to pay on two claims, they don't care who is at fault here. As long as they can say they can't determine who is at fault, they can charge two deductibles for the same accident. That is exactly what is going on. The insurance company is trying to re coop as much money as they can on the accident.|`|EMC7JwVBaa	Now it's time to start getting your money's worth from your insurance company. They can protect you with their lawyers in fighting this.  I have seen so many times cops writing their report to match the liar instead of assuming what the best evidence shows. The truck hit you. That driver  is more than 50% at fault, so the cause and blame all falls on them.
RWjvcCYoaa	There's a lot more involved than just annual income. Even when making $150,000/yr, you could still be turned down. If it's your first car purchase, no lender will take a chance on you. If you've financed expensive cars in the past and the loans were paid off in good standing, possibly. But there would have to be at least one previous car loan of $75,000 or more on your credit history.<br>  <br>  Next is insurance. A car like the R8 isn't something you can get insured with most insurance companies. And the ones that will cover it charge a huge exotic car surcharge in addition to your sports car and possibly age and/or driving record surcharges. If you're under 30 or never had an exotic car before, you could easily be turned down for coverage. No insurance = no R8.<br>  <br>  Now assuming you can afford the insurance and you've financed a high priced car before, the next step is your credit history and current credit situation. Is more than 34% of your monthly income going out to monthly bills such as rent/mortgage, credit cards, revolving charges, personal loans, student loans, car payment and insurance, etc? If so, you're a TD (turn down). <br>  <br>  Do you have any 60 or 90 day late pays? Or 3 or more 30 day late pays? You're a TD. Collections, liens, bankruptcy, repo, behind on child support? TD. And if you haven't been at your present job making $150,000 annually for the last two years, you'll get TD'd. <br>  <br>  As you can see, there's a lot to qualifying for a car loan. Especially on an exotic car like the R8. It's a great car to aim for. But it takes quite a lot to get it.|`|WxV9P9NQaa	do you get that in a month a year or wat. btw that is a really nice car but if you got that type of money. why not get an aston martin?|`|gEw83TRTaa	If you really are in a position that pays $150k / yr, you shoul dhave the basic skills necessary to figure this out.|`|jERevyR8aa	only you can decide that|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Lucky you.|`|UjLyPj4laa	In my opinion, i love audis, but with that kind of money u want to spend i would go with a nissan skyline GTR. you get more bang for your buck.

On the pro bikes they are oiled before and after every ride.  If you wear motocross boots and riding pants when on your bike then you can take if off.

VEIkVDtIaa	the odds are very high that the connector for the sensor is loose or that the terminals are pushed back and making poor contact.  the sensor is a magnetic induction sensor and they just don't fail.  <br>  <br>  if the condition only happens hot then typically what happens is that as the connector warms up it expands and when the metal terminals expand they break contact and  the sensor goes open circuit and you lose the signal.  when that happens the PCM doesn't know where the #1 piston is and it puts the engine operating system into "fail safe" or "limp home" mode.  when that happens you won't go over 2500 rpm and the car will run like you have a governor on the engine.<br>  <br>  the first thing to do is check the connector and grommet at the front of the timing belt cover to make sure its tight on the TDC sensor.  if its not damaged then the covers will have to come off to fix the connetor for the CKP sensor.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't pay the labor--its a comeback on the tech who did the belt replacement.<br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|ksSAPbMaaa	yea your crankshaft isn't sensing at all i would say it wasn't even put back in there designed to control the rocker roller system and if its not sensing crank they will not go much past idol and as for the engine shutting down the computer over rides a Major problem with the engine shutting down. good luck ...max|`|a01OSTTRaa	I had the same problem with my 2003 Civic SI. It happened after I had the oil changed at one of those oil-change-in-a-jiffy places, if you catch my drift. <br>  <br>  Before replacing the sensors and bringing the car back to have the timing belt checked for a jump, fix the most common sources of this problem first. <br>  <br>  1. Pull the crankshaft and cam sensor electrical connections and spray them down with brake cleaner. Empty out all the fluid and let them dry for a while... at least 30 minutes to 1 hour. DO NOT get this stuff on any painted surfaces. It will run the paint instantly. Also, just pull the plugs out. Do not pull the inside portion of the sensor out unless you plan on dumping your engine oil everywhere.<br>  <br>  2. While you are waiting for the sensor plugs to dry, check your oil levels. Honda K-series engines will throw these codes this if they are low on oil. If so, top it up. I was shorted 1.25 quarts by the oil change shop and my car went into limp mode when I warmed it up. <br>  <br>  When you are done, pull the fuse for the ECU inside the engine compartment, so the codes are cleared. Try driving again. If it works, check for oil leaking from the drain plug, oil pan, and anywhere near the sensors. Fix as needed.

This is not the only time I have heard of this type of problem with bus drivers. In the last few years I have heard of bus drivers caught on meth, and crack, as well as several who tested positive for alcohol and other substances. School systems have to fight for every dollar and buses and bus drivers are at the bottom of the totem pole. The pay is bad and the equipment is usually not very well maintained to begin with.

JNvjPoCSaa	normally i would ask:<br>  <br>  does it have cruise control?<br>  <br>  when did this problem first occur?<br>  <br>  what work had been performed on vehicle just before the problem and since the problem?<br>  <br>  How many different people drive this vehicle?<br>  <br>  Did the speedometer exhibit any problems/inaccuracies prior to failure?<br>  <br>  Does your odometer function? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  However the most common type of response for this question:<br>  <br>  If you have cruise control:<br>  cable housing threads to left side (drivers side) of the transmission tail housing, over to left frame rail, heading up the back of left inner fender where it screws to the transducer (mounted to the top of inner fender well). A second cable from transducer then heads into firewall near steering column and into back of speedometer (just pushes into it and retained with attached spring steel retainer).<br>  <br>  If no cruise control:<br>  After transmission tail housing, heading forward of vehicle on left frame rail, into firewall at same location.<br>  <br>  If it is still stock, it should have a fold over retainer on the firewall.<br>  <br>  Check to see if your odometer is also not working, most often if the speedometer head has problem it is only with one or the other.<br>  <br>  The push in spring lever at back of speedometer also releases the cable by pushing in on it and gently pulling the cable out. It is accessible by braille reaching up past the brake pedal support toward back of speedometer housing but that should be the last course of action.  <br>  <br>  Assuming both speedometer and odometer not working, un-thread cable from transducer to firewall (if cruise) and spin cable by hand with someone watching speedometer for any reaction (try both directions for a bounce). If that works, reattach and move further back, to transmission and re-perform.<br>  <br>  Most often the transducer fails and takes out the lower cable. At times this will cause the need to replace the ‘driven gear’ which is not hard to replace: behind same point speedometer attached to transmission. The color of it dictates what you replace it with (color specifies a ratio).<br>  <br>  Obviously many will hook up a drill to spin the cable for diagnostics and that does work. Crushing the cable is not difficult so carefully chuck it up if you do so, and do not feel you need to tighten as if it were a drill bit... or else then you will need a cable.<br>  <br>  In either the the cruise or no cruise application the cables will pull out of their housings at top end(s) if inspection desired and or lubrication. <br>  <br>  <br>  toad|`|ehJ45unqaa	on the drivers side of the transmission is where it goes in, and goes up through the firewall, and up into the back of the dash.

9ee6572e98b952a4bf68a1e6e6c2b500aa	The big 3 upgrade is always good to do but it won't help your battery from dying.  It is mainly used to help prevent headlight dimming issues and to allow the alternator to deliver more current to your car's electrical system.<br>  <br>  A yellow top battery will only be good if you plan on listening to music with the car off for periods of time.  It is a deep cycle battery which means it can be drained and then recharged.  If you do this with a regular battery it will die in a short amount of time.  <br>  <br>  Yellow tops are good if you listen to music with the car off or possibly if you have a large system.  Other then that I would not recommend one as they are not ideal for starting an engine.  They can start engines just fine but they are not going to be as good as a regular style battery (or red top optima battery).<br>  <br>  One reason your battery could be dying is that your alternator is possibly failing.  If your alternator doesn't completely charge your battery when the car is running it will slowly kill the battery.  This is due to the same reason as said above with a regular battery not being able to be discharged and then recharged constantly.  In this case a yellow top battery would help.  It may only help for a short amount of time as your alternator may eventually fail.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|RiQA4Epraa	battery has no thing to do with it<br>  <br>  alternator is what the system runs of off while the car is, not the battery|`|tLilNlptaa	Big 3 upgrade is always recommended with cars with aftermarket amps and subs. The reason is that they put in wires that are only get buy with the equipment on the car itself, adding extras add more strain, and causes light dimming. Thicker wires moeans more current available.
JXWC0fxPaa	First, I hope that you're feeling better. Don't re-schedule your test until you get the bug behind you.<br>  <br>  Here's the secret. The parking space should be at least one and a half times the length of your vehicle. If it is smaller, it will take some back n forth to squeeze it in.<br>  <br>  Pull up next to and about 2 feet away from the 'vehicle'  that will be in front of you. Activate right turn indicator. Drop trans in reverse and back up slowly all the while checking the rear and right side mirrors AND looking back. Yeah, you gotta be a bit of a contortionist for this exercise. That's why you back slowly. As the back of your vehicle passes the back of the 'vehicle' next to you, turn the wheel right and aim the right rear corner of your vehicle at a point about 3-4 feet in front of the right front corner of the 'vehicle' behind you. Straighten out. As the front of your vehicle passes the back of the 'vehicle' in front of you, slowly turn back to the left. As you straighten out, you should be within 18 inches of the curb. A pass. Have a go at it a couple of times to warm up, then nail it for real.<br>  <br>  All the best.<br>  <br>  p.s. I don't know why parallel parking is a pass/fail item. Points off, yes, but not fail in itself. I never failed anybody on it unless they showed me that they were homicidal behind the wheel.|`|ei9k2ehuaa	ok..This is the best suggestion i can give you.<br>  <br>  First pull up to the back tire of the other car ( is there isn't a car, just imagine you are pulling up to the back tire of a car) then look through the side mirror that's facing the curb to guide you, so you don't hit the curb. Turn your wheel to back up into the curb and..........you can pretty much take it from there. <br>  <br>  If you see you are about to hit the curb, just back out and start allover. They don't take off points for backing out and trying again, they only take off points when you hit the curb.|`|Us0XGMwfaa	Pull along side the car in front of you about 36 inches away from it.<br>  Start to back up, turning your steering wheel  to the right when your front tires get even with the car next to you back tires turn the wheel the other way.

G9fTHtJfaa	You can purchase any amp that has 600 watts rms at a 2 ohm load.  The lowest resistance the subs can handle is a 3 ohm load and remain stable. When dealing with car audio never focus on the peak wattage or the max wattage and such. Thos wattages are only for advertisement purposes. They don't reveal how powerful the amp, sub or speaker really is. The RMS wattage tells how powerful the product is or how much power a roduct can take without pushing the risk of blowing or frying your equipment.<br>  <br>  A 600 watt rms mono amp will split the wattage giving each of your subs 300 watts each, which is the rms rate of each of the subs.<br>  I suggest the Alpine mrp-m650 amp. if not that then Rockford Fosgate, Pioneer, Kenwood, MTX, and Hifonics have good amps.|`|kiaO8AaQaa	with personal experience i would use 1000 amp punch and split it between the two it should sound pretty good

Stop it right where you are at, call someone to bring some coolant, let it cool and add some. It is that,Oh I can make 1 more mile or to the next exit that will cost you every time, and it did. Ok , as for the car now, you can try to get it going again but it does not sound promising. If it is blown you will need to replace the engine, Cost? More then what it will be worth if you do it. So I think you should start looking for a new car. If it was rattling, grinding lacking power, won`t go any faster, BOOM! It`s gone. (R.I.P.)|`|i5lk5eN2aa	I suspect that your engine may now have severe warp damage and that the engine no longer has enough compression to start. A junk yard's bread and butter is the overheated cast aluminum engines which sends thousands of otherwise perfectly good cars to their junk yard because the engine was destroyed by someone who did not immediately pull over and shut the engine off when it overheated. The cylinder head and piston cylinders of a cast aluminum engine can reach destructive temperatures within a couple minutes after the temperature warning indicator light comes on. That engine should be shut off at the first instant it is safe to pull over after that temperature warning indicator light comes on and people who insist on running it to the next service station or the next interstate highway exit almost always pay a high price for the damage they do to their engine.|`|8duiF4YZaa	from your story, it does not sound good, to me it sound like you blew up the motor, you probably blew a intake gasket or a head gasket, allowing the oil and coolant to enter the combustion chamber. when this happens, the motor is now junk and will not run again<br>  <br>  never over heat a vehicle, it just makes things worse, always watch you temp gauge, if it gets way hotter then normal or in the red area, stop asap and let it cool<br>  <br>  you are going to need to find a new car, replacing the motor on yours would exceed the value of the vehicle<br>  <br>  sorry about your luck
jUuYMVqiaa	personally i think buying cars off ebay is a bad idea. i personally know someone who scammed a bunch or people over ebay who thought they were getting a hummer, sent him the money, then never got their car. needless to say, he was in jail for a long time.<br>  so dont trust it!|`|gYDBdsWRaa	ya tht is a scam. i sell alot of stuff on craigslist and sell alot of stuff on craigslist and people send replies like tht all  the time.|`|608129845852d8321ae30c2a2d0febb8aa	It is scam, It has been for a while in all the states. They are in military and have been called on duty..... even paying through ebay will not get your money back, nor get you your car..... so just buy something that you are sure you are getting. <br>  <br>  i currently have nissan altima 2003 for sale... if interested.<br>  <br>  lprimakov@yahoo.com
r1D9P4Vyaa	You will never have to change the brake fluid, just add & bleed when necessary.(when brake parts are replaced other then just pads or shoes) Also after a brake job, when done right, it will not make any squeaking, creaking noises or have any brake pulsation/vibrations. I suggest you bring it back to who ever did the brake job and tell them to fix the problem, For free of coarse. Good Luck.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	Brake fluid gets acidic after about 3 years. Most manufacturers recommend replacing it, before it begins to cause damage to the piston and wheel cylinder seals. It eventually turns to muck. It its designed to absorb moisture. After it has done it's job, it gets dark and thick. REPLACE IT!!! Use ONLY the fluid from the manufacturer, not the parts store. Not all chemicals in dot 3 or dot 4 are the same!! Many different fluids are NOT compatible with each other. Have your technician "exercise" your pistons with the new fluid before the last bleed out. Any restrictive muck should work itself loose, and return your stuck (probably) pistons into good working order. Good Luck!!|`|ehJ45unqaa	did the person who did your brakes replace the rotors or just resurface them? If they didn't resurface them and only changed the pads that would explain it. As for brake fluid, most places usually bleed the brakes after doing a brake job. You need new fluid when the brakes feel really soft, or spongy. Not hard and responsive.|`|KhbjVIx7aa	Noise is mostly due to vibrations between the brake rotor and caliper. Many times when replacing brake pads, shims are put in place to resolve this issue. Take your car back to the shop and let them know about your complaint.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	The brake fluid will never, ever be the source of any noise. <br>  Have the shop that did your brakes check them out.|`|AA10516006	First Look and see if your brake master cylinder is low
frQdMtHMaa	well heres the deal man...the subs sound like the best deal in the world but just be sure to read customer opinions on the website, and you can do this by searching it in yahoo.  Now a 1800 watt amp will be more then enough to power that dope...so you good on that, just make sure the website is good by searching it on yahoo.  Because if your going to pay for some subs, then you dont want to get ripped off, because they are nice things to have.
tLilNlptaa	I have order 2 alpine type r subwoofers and kinetic battery from onlinecarstereo and service and shipping is great. Best buy marks up their inventory big time. For example the type r sub is 132 on onlinecarstereo and 229 at best buy. But when I got my sub it was perfectly packaged just like I bought at best buy. You do have to wait for product to be shipped, but saving 100 dollars is worth the wait. A lot of time they offer free shipping as well.|`|frQdMtHMaa	best buy is always over priced and at the same time you get the product right off hand vs. ordering it offline.  Now dont get me wrong, if you buy subs online, check out the website and make sure you dont get something from a website that has been ripping people off for years now.|`|71thHKZAaa	This is a very good question, to answer it, most car audio sites have some kind of way of screwing you in the end! Some have knock off equipment and sometimes the crap they sell is used or generic, so watch out! <br>  <br>   The best place to buy audio equipment is <a href="http://www.crutchfield.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.crutchfield.com/.</a> They have quality products and you could never beat their service!
