mlAwNRWhaa	Every Acne Sufferer has to face acne. Including myself, I'm a long time acne sufferer, and I have faced this disease. So I can tell you confidently, short of going for treatment at your local cosmetic clinic, there's not an awful lot you <br>  <br>  <br>  Waters healing power <br>  Water is probably one of the most important things when it comes to acne. Water can help prevent and heal acne, and scars. As well as having a general positive impact on the overall health of your body. Drinking plenty of water should be top of things to do.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stress and its effect on acne <br>  I think we can all relate to stress. Everyone at some point or another in their life has had to deal with a stressful situation. However, research has found that people, who are less stressed, heal quicker? So take a breather, and just relax, and your acne scars should take care of themselves.<br>  <br>  <br>  Zinc Supplements <br>  Probably one of the most over looked supplements, however zinc has a major role in the skin rebuilding process, so it’s important to stock up if you want to keep your skin clear. Zinc also has an anti-oxidant property which is good for cleansing the body of harmful bacteria, and its harmful bacteria that cause acne in the first place.<br>  The number one key to keeping free of acne scars though, is to treat your acne quickly, and prevent it flaring up (this is when scars are created). For this you'll need a good product.<br>  I personally get wonderful results with Andesine|`|WI8qeyJmaa	get a TCA peel...you can order it online but research it well before trying it yourself and don't use more than 35% strength......ever!!|`|R7hqAj5Paa	Acne free in 3 days or less, here is how: <a href="http://nomoreacne.notlong.com" rel="nofollow">http://nomoreacne.notlong.com</a><br>  Featured on TV

That's why you will notice he may have cold after cold over the next year or two (whereas, when he was younger, he spent most of his time at home where he was more protected).

6ecc210754a6de7e9d52b2bd7326c6b9aa	Do you have a gym with a pool where Aqua aerobics classes are taught? Because swimming and aqua aerobics are ways to exercise without putting stress on your joints. You can get a pair of hand weights and do some exercises with them for upper body strength. A popular thing here is something called chair aerobics. Don't laugh, it's damn hard! Your thighs and legs get the work even though you are sitting in a chair. It really tones you up as good as any walking. I know you don't want to do this always, but until your fractures heal you might want to think about these types of exercise. Don't forget to stay hydrated with water and sports drinks if your exercise makes you sweat a lot.  Keep your potassium levels up by including oranges (or orange juice), yogurt and bananas, all good sources of potassium.  By all means, start that diet as long as it is a healthy diet that includes veggies, fruits, and whole grains! <br>  <br>  Be careful about the those "free" offers for pills.

Very carefully! What can you eat? In the beginning, try lots of softer foods like macaroni-and-cheese, rice, pasta, steamed vegetables, broiled fish and chicken, soups and stews; anything that is easy to put in your mouth without a lot of biting and hard chewing. Avoid foods that are very hot or very cold. The “glues” used on your appliances and braces take a few days to really harden well and temperature can affect that.<br>  <br>  Let's talk about what you shouldn't eat! All foods must be cut or broken into bite-size pieces and chewed in the back of your mouth. Avoid tough meats (like steak, fried chicken, hamburgers), crusty and hard breads, and vegetables like carrots and celery or corn on the cob. Even good-for-you fruits like apples have to be cut up before the pieces go in your mouth. And of course, all those hard, sticky, gooey candies have to be put aside for the time you are in braces. Peanut butter sticks to braces like you wouldn’t believe!! You have to be protective of your orthodontic appliances for as long as you are in treatment. Before you know it, you'll be able to bite a cucumber again and chomp down on an apple. <br>  <br>  Avoid:<br>  * Chewy foods: bagels, hard rolls, licorice<br>  * Crunchy foods: popcorn, ice, chips, tic-tacs<br>  * Sticky foods: caramels, gum.<br>  * Hard foods: nuts, candy<br>  * Foods you have to bite into: corn on the cob, apples, carrots<br>  <br>  Chewing on hard things (for example, pens, pencils or fingernails) can damage the braces. Damaged braces will cause treatment to take longer and result in costly repairs.<br>  <br>  General Soreness<br>  <br>  When you get your braces on, you may feel general soreness in your mouth and your teeth may be tender to biting pressures for three to five days. This can be relieved by rinsing your mouth with a warm salt water mouthwash. Dissolve one teaspoonful of salt in 8 ounces of warm water, and rinse your mouth vigorously. If the tenderness is severe, take aspirin or whatever you normally take for headache or similar pain. The lips, cheeks and tongue may also become irritated for one to two weeks as they toughen and become accustomed to the surface of the braces. You can put wax on the braces to lessen this. We'll show you how! You might experience this every time you have an adjustment, but usually within a day you’re feeling like your regular self again.<br>  <br>  Loosening of Teeth<br>  <br>  If you sense your teeth feeling loose, don’t panic. They’re not falling out (unless it’s a baby tooth.) This is to be expected throughout treatment. Don't worry! It's normal. Teeth must loosen first so they can be moved. The teeth will again become rigidly fixed in their newly corrected positions.<br>  <br>  CARE OF APPLIANCES<br>  <br>  To successfully complete the treatment plan, you - the patient- must work together with us. The teeth and jaws can only move toward their corrected positions if you wear the appliances exactly as instructed by us and his staff.<br>  <br>  The first and most important instruction is to brush your teeth often.<br>  <br>  It's more important than ever to brush, floss and rinse regularly when you have braces, Food loves to attach itself to all the brackets and wires and if left there, it is guaranteed that you will develop plaque, swollen gums, possible cavities, and really bad breath. We encourage you to come to the Oral Hygiene class and practice with the staff on correctly brushing your teeth. We want your teeth and gums to be healthy after you complete your orthodontic treatment.<br>  <br>  Follow-up your brushing with flossing and rinsing every single day. That will keep 95% of the bad bugs out of your mouth. Not keeping your teeth clean will result in more frequent visits to your regular dentist for professional cleaning. It may also delay your orthodontic treatment and may cause gum disease.<br>  <br>  Wearing Specialized Appliances<br>  <br>  You may be required to wear certain other appliances besides braces. Headgear, expanders, removable biteplates and tongue thrust tamers all come with specific instructions for you to follow. How well you keep those instructions will determine how long you have to wear them and that really is up to you. <br>  <br>  Initially, you may find it difficult to speak or you may slurp a lot. The slurping usually stops in a day or so when your mouth stops making the extra saliva. As for talking, the best way to get over the hump is just to keep talking, reading aloud, or even singing in the shower.
mlAwNRWhaa	Most infections are not serious and can be easily treated with antibiotics. However, if left untreated, some infections can result in kidney damage and even death. This is why it is so important to seek appropriate medical treatment if a UTI is suspected. <br>  <br>  UTIs are treated with antibacterial drugs. The type of drug used and the duration of treatment depend on the type of bacteria and severity of infection. <br>  <br>  Infections complicated by urinary obstruction (e.g., kidney stone, BPH) and other risk factors (e.g., spinal cord injury) may require surgery to correct the cause of UTI. Kidney infections may require hospitalization and as many as 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment to prevent serious kidney damage. <br>  <br>  Follow up urinalysis and urine culture is performed after treatment to make sure that the urinary tract is bacteria free.|`|yQdA5rHnaa	the infection will spread and cause you harm.

The reasons for that included the fact that it immediately made me tired and my moms opinion was that it made me emotionless. lol. Also, I had a lot of difficulty waking up in the morning. If I am not mistaken, Trazadone is something of a tranquilizer. It calms the nerves, but it also makes you want to take a nap. lol.|`|UcJPRhu3aa	i haven't tried any of the two but i am taking Vilift, it really works for me, i am more in control of my thought, emotions. my mood improved a lot.
2RzEaod9aa	Well, doing 3 sets of 10 everyday will soon become too easy. For any exercise to be effective, you must constantly challenge your body. Doing the same exercises for the same number of set/reps and still expecting to see results is like reading the same chapter in a math book over and over and expecting to learn something new. <br>  <br>  Results depend on:<br>  1. How well you do the exercise. Half-hearted attempts don't get you anywhere.<br>  2. How much you challenge the muscles. Again, don't just do the same thing over and over.<br>  3. What you're eating. If you want your muscles to firm up, you need to feed them properly!<br>  4. Genetics. Some people take longer than others.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps! And I sure hope you're doing way more than just squats and lunges if you want to see results...there are more exercises to work your legs, butt, and your glute-ham tie-in!|`|2U0zfDIkaa	well what would you want to see?

It is not decay and therefore the dentist usually won't mention it unless you are having problems. The tender spot on your gums might very well be an aphthous ulcer (canker sore) Good Luck, I hope things get better for you dentally.

Xt3N0fvAaa	Medicaid is for people on welfare. Medicare has 4 parts. Part A, the hospital, and Part B, and the doctor. They will take usually $96.40 out of your SSI check once a month for part B,  Part A is free.  In 2003 they created Part C. also known as medicare advantage plans. All this means is they combine Part A and B together, so instead of the government paying for 2 insurance companies, the one that handles your part A, and the other one that handles your part B. They just pay one company about $750 a month, and, they handle all your medicare.<br>  <br>       Medicare part C has 3 different ways to go.<br>  1.HMO is managed care<br>  2.PPO is managed care<br>  3.Private Fee for Service is not managed care because you don't have to go to there networks of doctors, but some, usually hmo doctors wont take a private fee for service, not because Private Fee for service is bad, but because it doesen't fit into the doctors little sceam of things.<br>  <br>  Medicare advantage plans can be as low as 0 cost after one pays the $96.40 a month for there medicare. One can also get there medicare Part D. "drug plan" included in a all in one plan with a medicare advantage plan insted of paying for a seperate drug plan.  Medicare advantage plans generally cost less, but, you have to pay copays.<br>  <br>       Alot of people think medicare pays 80% of the bill.  After medicare's deductables it only pays about 62%.

C[1]<br>   <br>  Legal status Prohibited (S9)(AU) Schedule III(CA) Class A(UK) Schedule I(US)<br>   <br>  Routes Oral, Sublingual <br>  MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine), most commonly known today by the street name ecstasy (often abbreviated E, X, or XTC), is a semisynthetic member of the amphetamine class [2] of psychoactive drugs, a subclass of the phenethylamines.[3].<br>  <br>  MDMA's experiential effects are more consistent than those produced by most psychedelics, and its euphoria appears to be distinct from most stimulants. It is also considered unusual for its tendency to produce a sense of intimacy with others and diminished feelings of fear and anxiety. These effects have led some to suggest it might have therapeutic benefits to some individuals. Before it was made a controlled substance, MDMA was used to aid psychotherapy, often couples therapy, the results of which are poorly documented. Studies have also recently been initiated to examine the therapeutic potential of MDMA for post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety associated with cancer.<br>  <br>  MDMA is criminalized in all countries in the world under a UN agreement,[4] and its possession, manufacture, or sale may result in criminal prosecution. MDMA is one of the most widely used illicit drugs in the world[5] and is taken in a variety of contexts far removed from its roots in psychotherapeutic settings. It is commonly associated with the rave culture and its related genres of music.<br>  <br>  There have been debates within science, health care, and drug policy circles about the risks of MDMA, specifically the possibility of neurotoxic damage to the central nervous system. Regulatory authorities in several locations around the world have approved studies administering MDMA to humans to examine either its therapeutic potential or, more commonly, its basic effects.[6]<br>  <br>  This article discusses the effects of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine, commonly known as "Ecstasy") on the human brain and body. More general information on MDMA, such as history and legal status, can be found in the main entry for MDMA. MDMA has complex effects, interacting with several neurochemical systems. It induces serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine release, and can act directly on a number of receptors, including a2-adrenergic (adrenaline) and 5HT2A(serotonin) receptors[1]. MDMA promotes the release of several hormones including prolactin, oxytocin, ACTH, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (which may be important in its occasional production of water intoxication or hyponatremia).<br>  <br>  It is not fully understood why MDMA induces these unusual psychoactive effects. Most explanations focus on serotonin release. MDMA causes serotonin vesicles in the neurons to release quantities of serotonin into the synapses. From studies using pretreatment with an SSRI to block the ability of MDMA to release serotonin in volunteers, we know that serotonin release is necessary for most effects of MDMA in humans.[2] Released serotonin is believed to stimulate several receptors that contribute to the experiential effects of MDMA. Laboratory rodent experiments have shown MDMA to activate oxytocin-containing neurons in the hypothalamus by stimulating 5-HT1A receptors.[3] This appears to contribute to some of the social effects of MDMA: upon administering a drug that blocked brain receptors for oxytocin, the effects of the drug on social behavior were reduced.[4] A second serotonin receptor, 5-HT2A receptors (which are important for the effects of hallucinogens), makes mild contributions to MDMA effects. When the receptor was blocked, volunteers given MDMA reported decreases in MDMA-induced perceptual changes, emotional excitation, and acute adverse responses [5]. In contrast, blocking these 5-HT2A receptors had little effect on MDMA-induced positive mood, well-being, extroversion, and most short-term sequelae. One possible explanation for some of these 5-HTA-mediated effects is that 5-HT2A stimulation induces dopamine release.<br>  <br>  Although serotonin is important to the effects of MDMA, other drugs that release serotonin, such as fenfluramine, do not have effects like MDMA.[6] This indicates that other neurochemical systems must be important for the MDMA experience.

Do you know how much bleach they use to get those things white? A by-product of the bleaching process is dioxin. Dioxin is a toxic substance linked to cancer and other health problems, and trace amounts of that dioxin is left in tampons. You want that kind of thing inside you? That's a big enough of a turn-off for me.<br>  I don't use that disgusting stuff. Bleached paper and viscose rayon and dioxin... Ew, not for me. I'd rather use something that isn't going to get tossed in a land fill and just hang around for years and years and years and years.<br>  Though if you still would like the convenience of tampons, you should definitely try looking into menstrual cups. They contain no bleach or dangerous chemicals, and guess what? They hold a lot more than tampons. They are many different brands to choose from which all have slightly different shapes and almost all brands have different sizes of cups, and some even come in colors.

In 04 I had to get back surgery for a herniated disc.  Nearly 2 years after surgery I STILL had painful and crippling sciatica, weak legs and pain.  A friend of mine turned me on to inversion therapy and I have been hanging upside down ever since.  what I've learned through treating with inversion therapy is that although we feel pain in  our backs, the pain really originates in the core, stomach or ab muscles.  As I inverted I felt my abs start to loosen as the spasms were stretched away.  As my abs relaxed they loosened their grip on my hip muscles, thighs and of course my back muscles.  Once these muscles were also relaxed my lower back and pelvis were free to go back into alignment and as they did my sciatica disappeared.  I have been virtually pain free for 3 years now because of inversion therapy and I want the world to know!  Inversion therapy has literally saved my life.  Do some research yourself and see if you think inversion therapy can help you as it did me.  All my best.

If you have no money then walk into an ER and tell them you have gone blind for a minute and then tell them the truth about the rest of it.

BLFduvnpaa	Short wait. I waited for 3 years to get mine.<br>  Well when I first had them, it was quite uncomfortable to have metal things in your mouth. But I got used to them.<br>  <br>  Sooner or later my dentist started to tighten my braces and I couldn't eat anything that was not mashed potatoes or soup for an entire month because it was so painful (it varied for my friends though, their pain lasted around a week to 3 weeks). As time went by, I got used to the fact that I had to endure some pain after my braces got tightened.<br>  <br>  And then, I got introduced to elastic bands to be put onto my braces a year or so into my treatment. They were also painful but you can always take them out for a little while if the pain gets too unbearable (but it's never that bad). They snapped quite often and without me realizing it, I would have swallowed them but it's not going to cause any damage or anything so don't worry.<br>  <br>  Then came retainers. I took wearing my retainers lightly and my teeth moved back a little so I had to wear ultra tight ones for quite some time. I ate with my retainers too which caused them to break so don't do that. Right now, I'm still wearing my retainers and I'm more or less used to it although with it on, I can't pronounce my 's' properly and my voice is muffled when I speak.<br>  <br>  But when using braces, always check after eating that you don't have disgusting bits of stuff stuck in between. And always brush your teeth properly with the braces on, especially around the area of the teeth not covered by braces. If you don't practice this often, the area not covered by the braces may turn slightly yellow and when your braces are taken off, the color difference can be seen clearly and it's really awful.<br>  <br>  Oh and also, after going to the dentist for your monthly or bimonthly braces check up, make sure you don't have any pointy bits of metal jutting out in your mouth and if you do, TELL YOUR DENTIST. I used to keep quiet about the jutting metal and I was always getting cuts in my mouth because it would scratch my gums and stuff.<br>  <br>  Best part of braces? You get to choose the color of the border thing they put onto your braces.<br>  <br>  The sad thing was, after I took out my braces, I kinda missed them because it felt like something was missing in my mouth. I wore them from 2005-2007 before I was all set to wear retainers.|`|LkfW1B24aa	well i like my braces......<br>  and you cud change the color too [so cool] lmao<br>  but youll get sick of em, so ive heard. i havent yet so....|`|7898793fc936ea9652a9eda7d5b7da81aa	Braces...:( <br>  Nothing much fun about them. The process of getting them on take a long time, your mouth might get sore from keeping it open for so long. The process of putting on the braces is usually painless but there is normally blood. The glue does not taste good at all, the dentists hands are in your mouth the whole time (remember to swallow your spit a lot)<br>  once u get them on, it's not bad at all. you can pick out your colors and go home.  Over the next few days the pain will start to kick in as your teeth begin the process of becoming straight.  Every 4-6 weeks they send u back in for a check up that usually last 15-30 minutes. They tighten your braces and allow you to change the colors of them.  There are a variety of wires and bands that they put in your mouth that close certain gaps and areas of your mouth. Depending on how bad your teeth are it can take anywhere from 1 to 2 years.  When u get them off, the normally take off your back braces(the ones that go onto your molars) then they make yours retainer and take the rest of the braces off.

Inversion therapy uses the effects of gravity to weight down your spine and stretch it out.  As this happens your spine is allowed to decompress and as that happens it relieves the pinched nerves in your spine.  Inversion therapy causes your muscles of your core (the hips, thighs, buttocks, back muscles and most importantly the stomach muscles) to stretch out.  As they stretch the knots and spasms leave and when these muscles are all relaxed they loosen their grip on your lower back muscles, your spine and most importantly your pelvis, allowing them to go back into natural alignment.  As they align this will cause your sciatica to vanish.  It's like if your car is out of alignment it pulls to one side and screws up the tires, it's the same with your back.  Inversion therapy will help align your spine and relieve your pain.  Hope this helps.|`|0be02e8cef9338abd273c570d77b584aaa	Hello Amy-Answers you have received like posture, pain killers, hot showers may help with the pain. You didn't mention your age, the longer you've had the problem could make a difference- some people try an operation when suggested by the doctors. I'd like to suggest Spiritual healing, this isn't Faith Healing, Spiritual healing can help no matter what IF any faith you may or may not have. Miracles and cures are always a great thing-but no Healer can ever say what will take place in a healing session, I'm sure you will feel  benefit, you may feel some benefit after one session, but it may take more sessions everyone is different both patient and healer. A plus point there are no ill side effects, you have nothing to lose. If you go to www.google.com and put in NFSH (National Federation of Spiritual Healers) they will assist you with a healer near you- If you have a Spiritualist church in your area-they too could help. Healers do not replace Doctors, but some GPs in the UK have recommend their patients to Healers. I hope you will soon be out of pain. All the very best.|`|9DF9GVPEaa	YOU CAN NOT MAKE SPINE STRAIGHT AGAIN ( I HAVE THE SAME)<br>  HOT SHOWERS AND PAIN KILLERS MEDICINE IS THE ONLY THING CAN HELP YOU.

Basically you do something till your muscles are physically unable to go any more. This creates "tears" in the muscle. these tears are NOT bad. When the tears heal they make your muscles grow and become stronger. It takes 48 hours for muscles to heal. The best way to get a 6 pack is to do as many sit ups as u possibly can. take a breather. and start again. do this about 3 times always going to the point were you cant pull yourself up again. The next day, take a break and dont use that muscle. then your tears will heal and start up again the next day.<br>  i alternate between push ups and situps.

They are all a form of bleaching your teeth.  Bleaching, however, may not correct all types of discoloration.<br>  <br>  Discoloration can occur for many reasons. The most common reason is the typical yellow stains you see as you grow older and consume too much tea, coffee, cola, red wine & tobacco. Tobacco in particular can cause teeth to quickly develop unsightly yellow stains.  The good news these yellow stains are easy to get rid of with bleaching products.<br>  <br>  Quick Summary of the Main Bleaching Methods:<br>  <br>  Chair-side bleaching – Your dentist can provide expert advice on how to achieve the best professional results in the chair. You will be able to use the latest technology which uses a bleaching system combined with a special light or laser which speeds up the bleaching and allows the dentist to achieve the best results very quickly.  The cost of the treatment averages out around $475 for the laser whitening. The great advantage is that you can walk out an hour later with white teeth. The disadvantage is that people with sensitive teeth report burning sensations and "twinges" from the bleaching compounds. The shorter the treatment time, the stronger the bleaching action. The heat caused by the light causes the bleaching agent to act faster, but can increase the sensitivity.<br>  <br>  Initial treatment followed by at home Treatment<br>  <br>  Some dentists do an initial in-office whitening with a very strong bleaching solution, then give you a kit with a weaker bleaching solution to use at home over time.  Your dentist will take a mold of your mouth and provide you with a custom set of mouth trays. Your dentist will then show you how to use the bleaching gel in the trays, and decide on the right level of the active bleaching agent for your gums and sensitivity. You are paying for an initial in-office treatment, a set of custom mouth trays, and your dentists expert help. Your dentist will likely use a 22-45% carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide solution which is a relatively strong solution while in the chair, and will give you a 16-22% solution for use at home. However, this can vary greatly according to your sensitivity and the actual whitening agent used.<br>  <br>  <br>  Do it Yourself at Home– Many online web sites and over the counter bleaching agents are now widely available. The major problem with the do it yourself kits - is frankly - you. Many of them require you to make your own custom trays by dipping plastic molds in hot water until they become malleable and require you to spend 45 minutes  to an hour wearing the awkward trays for several sessions.  It takes a least a week to see a noticeable difference, and most people will need 2-3 weeks.  However, the active ingredients are exactly the same and you CAN get professional quality dental whitening treatment for an absolute fraction of the cost. For example Maximum Teeth Whitening (just one of many suppliers) <a href="http://www.maximumteethwhitening.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.maximumteethwhitening.com/</a>  has a tooth whitening kits, including the trays, and 40 applications of 35% Carabide Peroxide for $30, which is pretty much an unbeatable deal. (We are not affiliated with this web site in anyway) The biggest problem with the do it yourself kits is the trays. Your dentist will give you a professional custom fit set of trays that do not expose the gum tissue. This is difficult to do with the do it yourself kits, although you can certainly painstakingly cut the molds to shape the exact profile of each tooth using scissors. Make sure the product that you buy has thick gel which stays in place. You should also look out for additives and fillers added to the gel which may cause additional sensitivity.  A good middle ground would be to have your dentist make you a set of custom mouth trays. You can then often just buy the bleaching gel direct and save money that way. <br>  <br>  Strips – Whiten teeth without a liquid component at an affordable price and minimal tooth sensitivity. The problem with the strips is that unless you have perfectly aligned teeth, they may leave unsightly gaps where they are not in contact with the tooth<br>  <br>  Brush-on whitening: formula or toothpaste – Many toothpastes advertise themselves as "tooth whitening". Some of the these products may help, but in general they don't make much of a visible difference.<br>  <br>  At home - baking soda, salt and Hydrogen Peroxide - this tastes foul but is cheap and does work.  Works well especially to maintain the colour over time when you have either a professional or DIY bleaching at home.|`|BLFduvnpaa	If it's really bad, go to a dentist to get it professionally whitened.<br>  It may be slightly costly but it'll help you get back a set of white teeth.<br>  <br>  Do you drink a lot of coffee?

In the most severest case survivors may develop pancreatic insufficiency and/or diabetes.<br>  <br>  The other complication is inflammation of the testes (ochitis) possibly resulting in sterility.

In my opinion, since you are still you, you should not start with some "special program" to lose weight.<br>  <br>  Instead, you should try break bad habits.<br>  <br>  Something like...<br>  <br>  Wake up: Ablut 7 - 8 am (It is never good to sleep until 11am...at that time, you are gaining fat.<br>  <br>  Eat Breakfast after you wake up, latest at 9am.

Do some jogging?<br>  <br>  About your diet: It is easy to check what is good and bad. But as everyone knows...vegetables and fruits are very good. Avoid candies, icecream, fast food...<br>  <br>  Tip: When ever it is difficult to "stay away" from those unhealthy food, think before you act. Ask yourself: "Ok, what would happen if I did not eat this candy? What do I have to lose and what do I win if I eat it?"<br>  <br>  It does work well for me. :D<br>  <br>  Make all this a habit, I know it is difficult, but you have to believe in youself!<br>  <br>  You might not lose weight very fast, it all depend on you, But if you do as I told you, you will feel better in the long run.|`|fPbjSNEHaa	Diet - see what you are eating and what you are not eating ... make an appointment with a dietician, they are specialists in your field and can help suggest things to help control your weight plus keep your energy levels up<br>  <br>  Exercise - you will need to do some form of exercise.

What you need to do to look good AND feel good, is eat right, exercise and be disciplined.<br>  I'm not sure what your eating habit is, but if you're eating too much, then you need to cut down the portions. Better yet, try eating 5 small meals a day, instead of 3 times a day. If you're eating lots of junk food, substitute them with something healthy! veggies maybe? Do you exercise enough? You should exercise at least 3-4 times a week, doing weight training and cardio. Do you like exercise classes? Like step classes or yoga? If you like yoga, try hot yoga as well.<br>  And lastly, you need to discipline yourself to keep your eating / exercise routine going. <br>  Good luck!

NSKimt1Qaa	Ironically, water retention can be caused by dehydration, as well as poor diet, not enough exercise, and certain medications. <br>  You could try cutting down on your salt intake. Salt dehydrates the body and makes it grab for any moisture it can hold onto.  <br>  By maintaining a healthy exercise regimen, you can increase both respiration and transpiration to help stop water retention.  <br>  Although drinking water leads to temporary weight gain, you should not stop drinking water to eliminate water retention. Water is vital to the body, hydrating the organs and helping to remove waste and toxins from your system. Dehydration sends your body into crisis mode and will cause additional retention.<br>  <br>  Some experts suggest swimming as a way to lose water weight. In addition to the exercise it will give you, water pressure can force water out of the body’s tissues and push the body to eliminate through urination. However, make sure that you drink additional water after a long or strenuous swim, as chlorinated or salted water can cause dehydration.<br>  <br>  Insufficient nutrition can also lead to water retention. Be sure to eat foods high in protein, potassium, and amino acids. These nutrients have been shown by scientific studies to relate to water levels in the body. Ensuring you are getting proper nutrition will not only help your overall health, but will also help you lose water weight.<br>  <br>  To help your body eliminate extra water, certain foods and herbs can aid you naturally. Dandelion root and green tea are both natural diuretics, although they may not be to everyone’s taste. One of the easiest ways to increase elimination is to add pure lemon juice or unsweetened pure cranberry juice to your daily glasses of water. These additions are excellent replacements for flavored or sugary drinks, can make your water taste colder and more refreshing, and help you stop water retention.<br>  <br>  Unlike fat, water weight is easy to get rid of and can take only hours to achieve. If you notice the scale suddenly jumping a few pounds for no reason you can think of, water is normally the culprit.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	If you think you're carrying excess water weight, get your blood pressure checked, as it usually gives you high blood pressure.  To prevent water retention, eat less salt and drink more water.  Your body will hold less water if it gets a constant supply of it.  Also check out the DASH diet.  It's recommended for people with high blood pressure but is also a healthy eating plan in general.|`|DJMPQlFDaa	As a medical assistant we are taught to lose excess water weight you need to drink more water because this tells your body that it does not need to retain more water because you will replace the water it loses.|`|OhYE3GhKaa	if it is truly excess water, you would not dehydrate by eliminating it.|`|DMhAPurkaa	I would suggest keep the water, because your body is 70 % at least water.Your brain needs it to function<br>  Water is a good electrical conductor, and you won t have optimum synapsis on low fluid..you can get headaches too.<br>  Green tea is very good.<br>  Also try this - sometimes there s a lot of weight in the colon.<br>  There have been cases of dropping 5 pounds, and up to ten<br>  cleaning out the plumbing down there.<br>  There are lots of colon cleanse teas, supplements..you can get these at @ GNC, whole foods store, the health food section of your supermarket. Also I suggest getting an enema . Use these in conjuction with each other.<br>  If you ve never used one, there s all kinds, but you can get a cheap two pack @ WalMart.<br>  It has 2 small bottles, with a salt solution in it, and if you don t do them regularly, it can be a clean up issue, so be aware of that.<br>  After you do them regularly, it won t be bad at all. This weirds out some people, but they only take 2 minutes, and you will feel so much lighter and better after.<br>  Now I advise not to use the saline ones so very often, because salt is an astringent, and you will get dehydrated. You can get unused bottles and fill them with just plain warm purified water, or water+sesame oil, or water+an herb when you are sick.<br>  The premise is your intestines are like plumbing that gets a bulidup and that inhibits vitamin absorbtion and harbors illness.<br>  That s the holding tank for "unwanteds" <br>  so get them out and help the colon heal and it will work better.<br>  If there is a bulidup, unfriendly bacteria can have food to live on and cause sickness. There are good friendly bacteria in there also.<br>  So much to tell you, not enough room here. <br>  When you have time, check out some sites and decide if you want to try this for your wellness.
6XEakY8daa	Imagine not knowing what is reality and what is in your mind. Music and voices that you hear you have to frequently second guess because they could be hallucinations, and voices you hear often tell you you are better off dead. Things you see can be completely imagined--yet you think that they're there. And thoughts could be completely out there, but you have no idea because they seem so real. <br>  I am twenty one years old and have had to sleep in my parents' room because I was sure that there were cameras watching me sleep, a delusion that I have had since I was five. I almost have to "double check" any thing that I think, hear, or see, because I'm rarely sure if it's real or all in my mind. <br>  <br>  I am pretty sure that one with schizophrenia is born with it, but it is possible that it doesn't manifest until later in life. But any age can have schizophrenia. I was diagnosed at age 19, but there have definitely been earlier cases, and later cases.<br>  <br>  One for sure way to make it worse is not taking medications that were prescribed to you. Though there is some controversy, if you were diagnosed and prescribed medication, you *must* take it, if you want to be free of delusions and hallucinations.|`|3AFuRMo5aa	My boyfriend always hears so many people saying things, but he can't hear them clearly.

It is unlikely that there is anything you can do to enhance your likelihood of getting it if you were never going to get it, but some people seem to have a latent disposition to the disease which can be worsened by drink, drugs, brain injury, etc.   It seems to be not one specific disease, but a family of related conditions all having roots in biochemical problems within the brain cells.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	I suggest a web search on this as you're only getting stupid answers here.

I have found since my accident that i hate the outside world an have no wish to venture out any more but have to force my self to go out at certain times. When the weather closes in an the rain comes in I find these days really hard to cope with an get very depressed. I hate the sound of the telephone ringing in the house an find it n intrusion in my life. I like to be on my own in the bedroom as it is the only room in the house that i can retreat to an call that space my own.<br>  I would suggest that you try to hang on in there as who ever you are talking about will come to you an talk when they are ready to do so an not before. suggest they get some form of counselling to help them get well but other than that please just be there ready when they need you.|`|Uac9AXmDaa	Yes i will go thought a cycle.

When someone is depressed, I think that they are living in a vicious circle, which disables their normal abilities, so they cannot function fully, which decreased their chances in getting better.<br>  I believe that life is all about balance and its what you put in life is what you get in return.. So if we focus on the negative then that's what our live will incorporate.. but if we focus on the positive .. well that just changes everything.. You become better focused, your energy level increases, you have more self acceptance and self worth.. there is so much more that I could say.<br>  But you need to be there.. often an individual cannot do it alone..Be determined and if she/he isn't then tell them that you will keep on pushing them, until they start living..

Hope that makes sense.<br>  <br>  If you miss a pill do not take two to make up for it that will make it worse. If it's within 12 hours take it straight away if not you have missed it and just take then next one like normal but you will not be safe to have sex for around 5-7 days unless you use other methods of contraception. Same if you are vomit within 12 hours of taking it.

ed71a2e7f354d346a0ff1de177befe5faa	Good on you for realising that it is unhealthy for you to spend so much time watching tv and on the computer.  That is the first step to doing something about it!  Next step is to get someone to support you in your need to change these habits, and thats what they are, just habits.<br>  <br>  Write  down a strategy to wean yourself off so much time on them.  Allow yourself so many hours per day (say 2 on the computer and 2 watching tv?) but this has to be treated as if it is set in stone so make it realistic.  Work out how many hours a week you do these things now and then work that into hours per year and you will be frightened at how many this works out as. <br>  <br>  Next step tell your support person how many hours you have set down to do these things and ask them to give you reminders about coming off.<br>  <br>  You will find that a lot of time you spend on these things you are doing virtually nothing and watching nothing that enjoyable, so plan what you want to do on the computer and turn it off when you finish that.  Same for the tv - plan what you really want to watch, watch it then turn it off.<br>  <br>  You also need some alternative things to fill up the time.  What about meeting your friends for a chat and a coffee, game of bowling, tennis, football etc.  Fill you time with things you really enjoy and it will not be so inviting to go back to your old ways.<br>  <br>  Look at yourself in the mirror each morning and tell yourself you are going to spend just 2 hours doing this, 2 hours doing that and all the other things you are planning to do.  Also add in study time and tell yourself - I am going to study for 2 hours this evening and that will help me get good grades in my exams and therefore I will be able to get the job I want later on.  (These are all examples, pick your own times etc.)    <br>  Be positive with yourself.<br>  <br>  Even though you say you have no friends, think hard and you must know people who could become friends.  Have you no friends as you never make the effort to contact them.  Well, make the effort.<br>  <br>  Decide to change today - be determined - and you will have a better life.  It's up to you and you alone, no-one can do it for you.<br>  <br>  Take care and good luck!|`|jHyDO7rcaa	Read, hear music, sing, dance, do any school activities, play an instrument.

wypaLDm0aa	usually the reason for procrastination is that this is how you view things<br>  <br>  i got school homework my job, test quizes and this new Business and you think about it all at once. When you do this is brings you down it intimidates you because you think have to do them all at once and it's so discouraging the only appropriate time is at the last minute because at the last minute everything else you don't think about no more because now this is the quickest thing you have to do therefor you get it done.<br>  <br>  so instead of thinking about the full load do what the navy seals do. Think about each siutation one at a time. so think about studying for your quiz before you think about your homework job business and only focus on that. you can tell the difference in how willing you want to get started on something if you pretend thats the only thing you have to do all day. then after that pretend your business is the only thing you have to do all day and so forth.|`|M58bB7RLaa	well you've must of done it for a long time.

reAtqf0Maa	that is definitely a BAD idea. doesn't sound like a good diet to even try! here is what i would do.<br>  <br>  well you could start out simple first. like for the first few days cut back a bit. maybe don't have that dressing on the salad. or have water instead of soda. stuff like that. start simple. then slowly go to the diet part. where you have a apple instead of a brownie. or yogurt instead ofice creamm. then start exercising and dieting. this is a slow process but much simpler because you can adjust easier.<br>  <br>  <br>  now for fast weight lose )like what your doing to keep motivated) do this. take ten exercises you can do at home and crank you favorite tunes while doing this. like this<br>  <br>  1.sit ups<br>  2. jumping jacks<br>  3. squat thrusts (squats but push your arms out when you squat then pull them back in, basically getting arms in volved in squats<br>  4. crunches<br>  5.push ups( on your knees if you have to but fininsh the set)<br>  6. on your hands and knees and kick a leg back (for the but)<br>  7.elbow to knee crunches ( for obliques)<br>  8.side leg lifts<br>  9. stand up and kick a leg forward while puching arms out forward<br>  10.get on back with legs in air then bring on leg to the stomack to the other.<br>  <br>  do eack of there for one minute and DON'T take breaks in between them. the only break you should take is switching from each e xercise. it should only take a few seconds to switch though. do these for as long as you can. after you do all ten have some water and start up again. i recomend this you do this 3-6 times a day which will give you a 30 - 60 min workout. do it longer if you can! <br>  <br>  <br>  whenever you feel like eating some junk food you have to get your mind off it. play a computer game. watch tv. read a book. exercise. if the craving is so bad then have something healtthy and you will feel great after knowign you stayed strong! this will keep you motivated.<br>  <br>  know you need to learn to love dieting. for instance, strawberries are very healthy for you. if you love them then keep them in the house more so you can have more yummy healthy food to eat from when you are hungry. <br>  <br>  know besides diet and exercise i recomend you drink green tea. it helps me lose weight while i am dieting and exercising! also eat celery. it is has lots of vitamin and minerals and it will keep you full! also it has water in it so it makes it a great diet food!<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  :)|`|q84KT11saa	well . . from my own personal experience . . I have Addisons Disease.  I take salt on occasion to balance out my needs in order to retain water.  If I do not . . I pee a lot.  So from my understanding if you were to take less salt, you would not be able to retain as much water, therefore you would get rid of some of it.  Also, if I take too much salt, I can do the opposite to myself by putting on more water weight.  I'm no doctor though, just my personal experience with water weight.<br>  <br>  I would recommend however you consult a doctor if it's a problem.  This is just something I learned from my endocrinologist and geared towards myself.  Your situation is likely different.|`|mWaNEiixaa	Foods high in sodium cause water retention.  Foods high in sodium causes weight gain.  The best way to lose weight is to stay away from salty foods or processed foods.<br>  <br>  Don't soups, dressings, processed or packaged foods, white flour, sugar - as these all aid in water retention.  Certain medications do as well.<br>  <br>  If you are using artificial sweeteners they may also cause an allergic reaction in your body that is causing you to hold on to water.  Alcohol consumption, lack of exercise, and stress are all reasons why you can be holding on to water.<br>  <br>  So eat every three hours, exercise, increase your fiber intake, drink at least 2 liters of water a day, and stay away from salty and sugary foods.

mlAwNRWhaa	They are floaters: A blurry spot that seems to drift in front of the eyes but does not block vision. The blur is the result of debris from the vitreous of the eye casting a shadow on the retina. The spot is the image formed by a deposit of protein drifting about in the vitreous, the clear jelly-like substance that fills the middle of the eye. Floaters are often described by patients as spots, strands, or little flies. Floaters are usually benign (not serious). They can, however, occasionally result from a separation of the vitreous gel from the retina. This condition is called a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). Although a PVD occurs commonly, there are no retinal tears associated with the condition most of the time. No treatments are available for floaters although they tend to become less annoying over time. Remember also that floaters are usually not associated with serious eye problems. Permanent or recurring white or black spots in the same area of your field of vision may, however, be an early warning sign of cataracts or another serious eye problem. If you experience a shadow or curtain that affects any part of your vision, this can indicate that a retinal tear has occurred and has progressed to a detached retina. In this situation, you should immediately consult an ophthalmologist since time is of the essence.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh... Yeah.. The Poem... LOL!|`|DPi4bTnuaa	Those "worms" are called floaters...it's all good though nothing serious..they appear if you're near sighted; have had inflammation inside the eye; have undergone cataract surgery;have had YAG laser surgery of the eye. <br>  <br>  So there!|`|Yz1pzloSaa	It's a floater.

( a long way off)!!<br>  As far as your Mum is concerned, She needs to eat little and often and include more healthy stuff in her diet. As for exercise if she can do a bit more vigorous aerobic type exercise and include a bit of resistance training as well, then she can certainly do a lot to maintain and slow down the effects of getting older.<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  UK Personal Trainer|`|SeIN4Yhdaa	It is inevitable to slow down with age.  The 'Ferrari' becomes a 'Chevy' and the only way to maintain that girlish figure is to stay as active as possible while watching caloric intake.  If you slow down, you have to consume fewer calories.  Watch those fats and carbs and focus on lean proteins and lots and lots of vegies.  Add fresh fruits to top off your diet.  If you adopt a diet with very limited artificial ingredients, it will be easy to maintain a good weight and healthy lifestyle.|`|gMpHvGq6aa	yes....

wOecmtrzaa	When I got my wisdom teeth out over christmas last year I was really scared too.  I had never really had such a big oral surgery, and I didn't know what to expect because of all the scary stories. (PS I'm 18, if you care:)<br>  <br>  Let me tell you what happens to you during getting them out.  This is what happened to me, and mine were partially boney and fully boney impacted, similar to yours probably.  I was not put down but just had nitrous.<br>  <br>  You will be taken back by your dental assistant and get set up with nitrous.  MOST IMPORTANT PART: tell your assistant that you are nervous and scared.  She will sit with you the ENTIRE time you are on NOx, and she can help you feel less scared SO SO much.  Listen to your assistant and breath deeply, you will get pretty floaty and high feeling.<br>  <br>  Your dental assistant (or DDS) will put some orajel around the areas that you will get injected.  AFter there numb, you will get injected and that will set in and you will be underway!  Your DDS will get at taking your impacted suckers out!<br>  <br>  You shouldn't really care about whats happening much around you once you get onto the gas.  If you are feeling anxious, you probably need a bit more, ask your DENTAL ASSISTANT! to raise the gas if possible.  If at any time you feel pain, raise your hand and your dentist will re-inject you.<br>  <br>  Twoards the end of your surgery you will be weaned off the NOx.  You will be okay, though, just be aware that you will feel less floaty and more grounded.<br>  <br>  After care: do EVERYTHING your DDS tells you to do, and you will have a great recovery.  Do stay on top of your pain pills, and reallly do make sure you eat *something,* because you will feel so much better.<br>  <br>  Be aware that on pain pills you could have side effects like nausea and vomiting, or auditory defensiveness and/or headache.  Just take the time to relax and catch up on a season of TV you missed (get it on DVD).  Good soup is pretty easy to eat, and will really make you feel much better.  Applesauce and pudding is great, too, on the cold side.  Just no straws for smoothies!  (the sucking is bad)<br>  <br>  You will do fine! I know because I was in the same position you are in now (except a few more friends of mine had gotten theirs out, which may have been a bad thing because of all the horror stories people like to tell, even if their experience wasn't bad.) The best thing you can do, really and truely, to have a better surgical experience, is to TALK TO YOUR DENTAL ASSISTANT.  I can't stress that enough.  She will help you get through it even though its scary by distracting you or telling you everything that's going on, whichever you perfer.|`|jPBO4ABPaa	There is nothing to be scared about, most dentist will numb the area before the shot, which is not so bad, it's pretty quick. You will not feel a thing after wards.  Just keep the gauze on the area and do as your dentist says and you'll be fine. <br>  People make out root canals to be so painful, the worst part is keeping your mouth open that long...lol<br>  Good luck, and relax|`|1cec78892e2912eecfe0874cf01092afaa	its ok.

I know exactly how you feel. We had conditioning and agilities for the past 3 days and even though I have been running my thighs and butt are sore. Pretty much everyone goes through this during preseason and it will go away once you get used to doing the exercises on a daily basis. However for now there are a few things you can do to temporarily relieve the pain. So first I would suggest ice. You should have iced your arms and legs right after practice as soon as you got home, this can prevent a lot of soreness. For now I would say try some icy hot and take an advil. Drink a lot of water as dehydration can cause the soreness to worsen. Lastly, relaxing and taking a nice warm bath can help. Good luck with your season!

At the same time drink at least 2 litres of water a day and always use the stairs whenever posible. Eat at least 1 apple and 1 banana a day and increase the amount of milk you drink. If you want a quick burst of weight loss you will need some help. I got some Acai Berry free at <a href="http://linkbee.com/ITRR" rel="nofollow">http://linkbee.com/ITRR</a> and I used that and saw about 20lbs come off very fast using all these thngs together. Good luck!|`|ljZ2yvdTaa	I think weight watchers is the best dieting option. it is a lifestyle change not a diet. you can still eat anything. It's just portion control. And you don't stop, so you don't gain the weight back. Go to weightwatchers.com for more info.|`|4d8QwNQGaa	Losing weight is definitely an endeavor but doesn't have to be a hard or strict regime if you make it fun. Finding others who are dieting and having a weight loss per week or month competition can keep you motivated. <br>  Weight watchers is a good way to go as it works on a points system and won't have you choking down foods you don't find appetizing or leave you with that hungry feeling. Replace snacking with healthy choices  like drinking water with an apple instead of eating chips. Celery and peanut butter is a good protein snack (and tasty!!) and the celery actually has negative calories. <br>  Personally, I am fond of cleansing. A good cleanse can eliminate stored wastes (pounds of it) in your system while cleaning your system so that it absorbs what it needs instead of retaining more waste to leech out water and nutrients. The one I use is very gentle and you can use it free to decide if you like it. I cleanse every three months and have never felt better. I will leave you the link. <br>  Don't forget the movement!! Dancing around the house to good music just while cleaning up can energize you while dropping pounds, joining an aerobics class, (again- the people motivator) is fun, as well as the Wii Fit, if you are so lucky to have a Wii! <br>  <br>  Good luck. Make it an adventure. Picture yourself as you want to be instead of worrying about not being able to get there!|`|zNn9VfRyaa	to lose weight u need to eat right and have a workout plan 5-6 days a week.u have to want it. <br>  ***try this u need to change ur diet. <br>  eat six times a day. ea of ur 3 main meals needs to combine a lean protein such as chicken breast ground turkey turkey bacon egg whts also combine that with a complex carb such as a baked potato or sweet potato wild rice brown rice oatmeal or girts. also add fresh fruit and vegies to lunch and dinner. pick fruits low in sugar like pears and berries. if u get canned vegies get ones with low sodium. eat every 3-4 hrs keep ur metablism moving.<br>  ***also the most important part is WATER drink at least 64oz. no soda or juice. water will curve ur cravings. <br>  u need to hit cardio 3-4 times a week running outside it great workout if u can hit a gym and cardio machine is great at least 30mins***<br>  also add weight/strength training 3 times a week.u can google free weight traning guides anywhere. its not hard to find things for free.<br>  ***plan ur meals ahead of time.always have a healthy snack with u so u wont be tempted to eat fast food. also if u wait to late to eat u will get so hungry u will eat the world. make time to work out start out with 30 mins then increase.its ur body treat it right. ur diet alone can help lose weight but working out makes ur body look good. shows muscles and tight skin which is sexy and beautful. stick with it ur body will amaze u!!! to be healthy and look great u need both in ur life. good luck email me if u have further questions

SeIN4Yhdaa	Ask her to join you for a daily walk or dancing.  Suggest that the 2 of you should try to get healthy together and join a gym of you can afford it. Help her with meal planning and grocery shoppng.  The key is to get her interested and to make sure it is about both of you and your health and not just about her.  Weight loss is so much easier with a partner that works with you.  Compliment any tiny little improvement such as: your face looks a thinner, are those new jeans...they look baggier than the ones you usually wear, look at her face and say "your skin is looking great...healthier".  Most important, keep it real and never tell her she should work harder, eat less, etc...  Those are negative comments so just stay positive, initiate activities for both of you and if she wants privacy to exercise, make sure you don't intrude, peek or input your thoughts.  If she wants you to comment after asking for privacy, she will ask.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|reAtqf0Maa	well you could start out simple first. like for the first few days cut back a bit. maybe don't have that dressing on the salad. or have water instead of soda. stuff like that. start simple. then slowly go to the diet part. where you have a apple instead of a brownie. or yogurt instead ofice creamm. then start exercising and dieting. this is a slow process but much simpler because you can adjust easier.<br>  <br>  <br>  now for fast weight lose )like what your doing to keep motivated) do this. take ten exercises you can do at home and crank you favorite tunes while doing this. like this<br>  <br>  1.sit ups<br>  2. jumping jacks<br>  3. squat thrusts (squats but push your arms out when you squat then pull them back in, basically getting arms in volved in squats<br>  4. crunches<br>  5.push ups( on your knees if you have to but fininsh the set)<br>  6. on your hands and knees and kick a leg back (for the but)<br>  7.elbow to knee crunches ( for obliques)<br>  8.side leg lifts<br>  9. stand up and kick a leg forward while puching arms out forward<br>  10.get on back with legs in air then bring on leg to the stomack to the other.<br>  <br>  do eack of there for one minute and DON'T take breaks in between them. the only break you should take is switching from each e xercise. it should only take a few seconds to switch though. do these for as long as you can. after you do all ten have some water and start up again. i recomend this you do this 3-6 times a day which will give you a 30 - 60 min workout. do it longer if you can! <br>  <br>  <br>  whenever you feel like eating some junk food you have to get your mind off it. play a computer game. watch tv. read a book. exercise. if the craving is so bad then have something healtthy and you will feel great after knowign you stayed strong! this will keep you motivated.<br>  <br>  know you need to learn to love dieting. for instance, strawberries are very healthy for you. if you love them then keep them in the house more so you can have more yummy healthy food to eat from when you are hungry. <br>  <br>  know besides diet and exercise i recomend you drink green tea. it helps me lose weight while i am dieting and exercising! also eat celery. it is has lots of vitamin and minerals and it will keep you full! also it has water in it so it makes it a great diet food!<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  :)|`|gGP8FqzPaa	hi, the best way to lose weight is to make a little diary and take notes of everything you eat each day for a week.

Limit saturated fats to less than 4 grams per serving, and avoid all trans fats. Don't buy foods where high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), or another simple sugar, is more than 4 grams per serving, or one of the first five ingredients. You're avoiding simple sugars in foods not just because of the calories but because they induce highs and lows in blood sugar that put you into a cycle of craving more high-calorie foods.

373aa613c0008fa4b49c5a5fadc039c0aa	If you're not a virgin don't tell him you are. Starting a relationship off with lies will only complicate things in the future. If you are a virgin then I guess you would just act like you've never had sex before. You can't really define virgin behavior except for the stereotypical innocent girl that takes things slow and does not do anything remotely close to sexual.|`|44BEm1Uhaa	I bet he will know,as soon as he falls into it.|`|cjaEHwEvaa	Yeah her confidence gives it away, but most guys don't particularly want a virgin, just not a slut. You have much more fun with someone who knows what they're doing :)|`|HdzKRlsiaa	Yes?  Just let him do all the work.  And also, stop hideing it from him.  Your relationship is just gonna go downhill|`|7xc8jgLXaa	not accurately...|`|epD0VxFkaa	well yea most of the time they can tel becuse when your a virgin you bleed and your vigina is real tight|`|l34DJE2Gaa	I have no idea but I'm sure when you start whipping out certain moves and such he will get a little suspicious. Anyway, why do you need to pretend or act like a virgin, you should be honest from the get-go about not being a virgin. You don't need to spill every detail all at once but be honest. You shouldn't start a relationship out based on a lie, he'll eventually find out.
9zLhZHRCaa	do 7 minute abs every other day|`|XA7BfZikaa	i heard belly dancing works|`|E14cuDlZaa	Crunches. Lots and lots of Crunches. Trust me they will get you abs in no time.

Check out the Internet or Youtube how to do them properly!|`|czB9nABWaa	sit ups<br>  rollovers (point your toes in the air while lying down, hands in the air and move your body)<br>  lay on the ground with some one standing above you. they push your legs down, and you bring them up.<br>  wall sits <br>  run up the stairs a few times|`|y6hR10Kqaa	jogging, swimming, biking, sit up.<br>  <br>  Avoid from eating taco, nacho, burrito, enchilata, burger, pizza, hotdog, all you can eat buffet.|`|Azww28cvaa	lay on your back on the floor. lift your legs and body up so that you are only on your butt.|`|WUxMliGjaa	i dont know whether it's actually possible but laughing a certain number of hours a day<br>  <br>  why do you want abs anyway ... =/ so manly.. maybe you should reconsider and get "toned" instead|`|2SScKK2Gaa	You can just excersize like even if you just run alot, you can also do situps.

qWPLDgPiaa	Go to the doctor, if you can't then here's what you do:<br>  keep you leg straight, and lie down. Apply icy hot on it, wrap it tightly with any type of cloth, then rest! :)<br>  don't try to bend your knee, just keep it straight, and rest! :)<br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|AA11332588	Tell your parents.  I fell on the ice and had the same symptoms as you and did nothing for a year.  When it got bad enough I finally told my Dr. and I had an MRI and it showed a torn meniscus.  I had arthroscopic surgery and am good as new in 3 weeks!  I have no arthritis either.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Tell your folks right now, they may have to take you to urgent care for xrays!
ed71a2e7f354d346a0ff1de177befe5faa	It's all about balance.  There's nothing wrong with having online "friends" but you need real friends too.  You sound like a friend to him.  Can't you invite him along to places with your other friends so that he gets out and gets to know more people?  This would be really good for him if it's possible.<br>  <br>  He's lucky to have you as a friend anyway.

Think about not doing it when you sit down ans sooner later you will stop.
ZzdurUuLaa	That happened to me once, but i found out it was just my hair ^.^ <br>  Heheh!!!!!!! Well, i guess maybe its a rash, an itch, or just like, an EARACHE??|`|H7L66ynJaa	It sounds like ear wax but I would advise seeing your doctor.|`|VSQYLWt6aa	Might be a buildup of pressure that could result in a earache, that might or might not result in leakage from the ear.<br>  That should only happen if you have problems with the inner ear, like me, though...<br>  <br>  If I'm right, I'd make sure you have cotton balls available, as if the leakage happens, the best way to be able to walk around, is to tape cotton balls to your ear.|`|GAHFiIqSaa	It is quite possible that you are feeling a ghost/spirit. They often chose one of the ears to attach themselves to a person. <br>  <br>  Try the following: Think (you need not say the words) to the possible spirit, "I can feel you, will you please move." If it is a spirit, it will immediately be obvious. You may hear its responses in your mind as if they were your thoughts (telepathy).|`|A1lVrI8Yaa	You might have a earwax block that is touching it and causing that feeling. You should get it checked out by a doctor in case that it is worse than you think it is.
oTmylEGUaa	Yes unless if they have cold sores or they are sick.|`|ZvWDWvA1aa	People get sick from smoking packs a day for 20 or more years. I can't believe how paranoid people have gotten lately. The answer is YES! And tell the person your sorry for all the crap smokers are getting in society!!!!!!|`|AA12256470	Um yeah. You won't like get addicted to smoking if you share a drink. Relax, people get really paranoid these days...|`|0OpKpEbEaa	Uhh...what are you expecting to get?
bKZo9ssPaa	Quit.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	I'm been smoking for over 45 years, and I only started to think about quiting in the last few years, but so far I can't. And I still swim over 3  hours a day, none stop.<br>  take care<br>  dave|`|FN8meC6taa	You can quit.  I smoked longer and quit cold turkey.  Just think about how much younger you will look and how much healthier you will be.  I have not had one for over two years now!  Also, no one believes that I am my age.   They always guess I am ten years younger.|`|adLSRFrZaa	I quit a year ago.  I just up and quit.  I've done it many times before that, but I was just sick and tired of being sick and tired.  It has worked so far.
S7Q3fRvoaa	Actually, the calorie amount is ok.  You are actually supposed to have a good amount of calories at breakfast because it jump starts your metabolism.  The foods you ate weren't  terrible, however you could have made better choices.  You had too many starchy carbs for breakfast and not enough other things.  You should always aim to have protein and a serving of fruit in addition to some carbs.  Here are some good healthy breakfasts that are filling as well.<br>  <br>  -oatmeal made with milk and topped with almonds and berries<br>  -3 egg whites, 2 slices toast, apple or orange<br>  -slice of peanut butter toast, piece of fruit, glass of low fat milk<br>  -fruit/yogurt parfait: low fat yogurt, topped with a bit of granola and some fresh fruit<br>  <br>  Hope i helped :)|`|AA10363258	Yeah if you already consumed that many calories that is a lot.  How about next time having one piece of bread and a small bowl of cereal or even better skip the bread and have some fruit?|`|H2uAJoeMaa	The calories depends on what your weight is, and whether you are trying to move up or down in weight, but it's probably about right.<br>  <br>  Either way, you basically had nothing but simple carbs. Skim milk generally has more sugar than the full-fat stuff, and because it has little to no fat, that obviously increases the GI.<br>  <br>  To improve it a bit, go for complex carbs and include protein and fats.|`|6dff9c8d78f35f9cfa54823794d13d08aa	well, if it equaled that many calories, im guessing yes it was a bad breakfast. but, have a small lunch, like maybe a sanwhich.|`|Y42J2P2Naa	Probably.|`|jD1xacNbaa	I'd say alittle.
20DkFIQ7aa	yes you will get a free eye test and a bit of help towards the payment of glasses!
6w7FKrlfaa	yeah this has worried me as well.. i have lost half the weight that i want to.. but the thought of saggy skin scares me... so yeah i heard that losing it slowing can help.. eating right.. exercising... and apparently massaging the belly gets the blood pumping through it....|`|eU2Hg0Deaa	you need to tone up to prevent this, so the only answer is to exercise regularly aswell.|`|PwxmrBm9aa	Well done on your weight loss so far! I have only seen really bad saggy skin on people who have been very obese and have gone down to a normal size. Maybe use a firming lotion daily will help to tighten skin just in case you did get any excess skin, also doing toning exercises may help. Swimming is a good toning exercise and burns lots of calories, it works most muscles in your body. Also rowing is the same, burns lots of calories, tones and uses most muscles in the body. <br>  Good luck.|`|M0PW6LZTaa	Creams can help to keep the skin nourished, keeping the elasticity and strength, providing vitamins etc. I think this would help you, a friend used it with great success. Look at this website <a href="http://www.how-to-reduce-stretch-marks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.how-to-reduce-stretch-marks.c...</a> and see what you think.:~}
j182UjnMaa	i kno im a girl but with boys ive told i hav they seem closer and more comfortable talking to me <br>  they also dont mind discussing it tho we never use the actaul word (periods) jst like a secret name|`|MbdXS5Nqaa	doesn't really make a difference if you don't freak out, but I had a friend that would grab, and squeeze me when she got cramps from it.....don't suggest doing that to other people. I didnt' like that mutch|`|l8cl8Ww6aa	i wouldnt mind being around you as long as you are not extra moody.|`|Y6a7K4apaa	I don't mind :)
TC21ao0Paa	The Alcohol may have irritated your stomach. Black stools can indicate a bleeding ulcer. Does your black stool have a " tarry" appearance ? It may just be a fluke but, if it continues ( persists or worsens) then call you Doc soon.<br>  Hopefully, things will return normal on their own.<br>  <br>  I hope that this helped.|`|AA11762642	do u take vitamins, this could cause it. trust me pot dont cause it, but drinking will if u got posion from the vodka. dont worry just eat bland foods all day n u should be fine.
Ow0mduGEaa	In between 18 -21
mjC5XldXaa	You can go to the drug store and buy an emergency dental filling kit.  There are several on the market and they a kind of zinc oxide and eugenol (oil of cloves) paste that you can place in the cavity as a temporary measure until you get the permanent filling.  This should also ease any pain or sensitivity you may be having.  Good luck|`|dNGbZQx4aa	dont chew any gum, and after you eat anything brush your teeth or rinse your mouth so you dont decay the tooth
6gJODqqdaa	you should never stop them because of the spotting. it will go away. if you are new to the pill the spotting is normal and as i said will go away just keep taking them like you are supposed to and do not stop. because once you get your period and then start taking them again you might just spot again until your body gets used to them. if you have been on the pill for a really long time then you should ask your doctor to maybe change pills or something because you shouldnt still be spotting although ive read that some pills can take up to 6 months to stop the spotting. just keep taking them!!!!!! good luck with it.
AA11434633	Insulin is produced by the Beta cells (Islets of Langerhans) in the pancreas.<br>  <br>  I would disagree with - [alex] -.  Type 2 diabetes does not destroy beta cells until much later in it's development and, even then, what happens is that the beta cells 'wear out' or simply become too exhausted to produce enough insulin.  It's type 1 diabetes mellitus, an autoimmune disorder, where the beta cells are actually destroyed.|`|9TyEDcRzaa	beta cells of pancreas produce the insulin it is a ductless gland like organ|`|Ve6RAuq3aa	the beta cells in the pancreas<br>  <br>  anyone that suffers from diabetes means that the bodys own immune system has attacked the beta cells and killed them, meaning that the body cant produce insulin and therefore diabetics need to inject insulin and have a properly managed diet etc|`|EdB0ghKwaa	Have a look on Wikipedia (see below), it has a good explanation!
gD9JlpPFaa	No...it's quite dangerous to do that. Consult your doctor before to increase the dose.
GGlFHz7waa	That's impressive for a 14 year old. I bench 215 atm and im 21. I've been working out for years though. Keep working out as you progress through high school and onward, makes the stress go away :)
ewHmUtT6aa	Since its not your eating i wouldn't consider it an eating disorder, although the junk food thing could be considered part of one.<br>  The exercise seems like an addiction
jkTZHT2iaa	ADD or ADHD does not tend to go away, you just learn how to control it I myself have ADHD and the last time i took any meds for it it messed me up badly. ADD or ADHD is not a BAD thing, it can be controlled without any medication if you are able to work through the hard parts of it can be useful in some situations.
AA11631634	Under exertion or exercise, the slower the pulse means your heart muscles sufficiently pump enough blood to your body without strain. If you are out of shape, the body needs mre oxygen to keep up with the stress therefore the heart has to work harder and pump faster.|`|aEJVlxKiaa	ah well i can answer your first question....the truth is that when your heart beats too quickly...HEART ATTACK or you die from your heart beating so fast. slower pulse rate has less danger...and unless you are going into cardioacular rest...you will feel a lot better. Also, rapid recoverry rate, that is how much you can recover from just resting for like a couple seconds and you can start running or whatever again. A slower pulse rate means you're relaxed, and your heart doesn't get tired out.|`|9zLhZHRCaa	rapid recovery means your heart is used to it, and its healthy and you'r e fit.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	A slower pulse rate means your heart is less stressed when pumping blood.  A rapid recovery rate means your heart is good at adapting to the stress of a workout.<br>  <br>  The more you work out, the better your pulse and recovery rates.
QGbmXzvGaa	I think there is a problem with your alveolar, or periodontal, or gum, or development process, I suggest you soon see your dentist|`|JPa0GzDjaa	You could have a small hole somewhere that you aren't able to see. Put a bit of vinger on some cotton wool and put it on the molar. Vinger does relieve pain, though MAKE SURE, you brush your teeth afterwards as Vinger will erode them. <br>  <br>  (It doesn't sting either.)|`|IXKaj6Xhaa	Slice an onion and chew on it with that molar. I t really works. If that doesn't help you need to go to the dentist.|`|12wzsJg4aa	u may have an abcess get to a dentist|`|AA11403032	Paracetamol.<br>  <br>  Or get some Difflam oral rinse from the chemist and gargle with that.|`|ffxqr6wFaa	Well you need to see a dentist asap.  In the meantime try gargling in either warm salty water or warm diluted TCP.<br>  <br>  Try placing a hot water bottle or equivalent near the affected area.  Have you any oil of cloves? That's also good.<br>  <br>  Paracetamol every 4 hours will help.<br>  <br>  Try avoiding hot or cold drinks and eating on that side.

gSo4dR7oaa	HIV is the virus that damages the immune system and can lead to AIDS.  HIV is a sexually transmitted infection, and it can also be transmitted through sharing needles for drug use, or it can be transmitted from a woman to her child during delivery or breastfeeding.  You do not have to have another sexually transmitted infection first before getting infected with HIV.  However, having any other sexually transmitted infection makes your body more vulnerable to HIV infection.<br>  <br>  All of that said, you can not get HIV from someone who does not have HIV.  You can not get any sexually transmitted infection from someone who does not have a sexually transmitted infection.  The problem is that most people do not have symptoms soon after infection, so you can not tell if someone has HIV or another sexually transmitted infection just by looking at them.  The only way to find out if you have HIV or another sexually transmitted infection is to get tested.|`|9TyEDcRzaa	STI is  Sexually Transmitted Infection --please understand the HIV is  a STI--- ---and also the infected blood transfusions also spread the disease ---where all accidental contact of infected blood there all some chances of infection present --so your STI  is imaginary you think|`|LrGmpacOaa	HIV/AIDS is an STI.

Do you jog or ride a bike? Both good ways to lose weight. Running will lose even more. You could also try just eating cereals with skimmed milk for a week. They are low in fat and are fortified with minerals and vitamins so you should still get a balanced diet. Add fruit to you menu too. Obviously lay off the pop and sugar. Kellogg's corn flakes, or special K are good.  Special K suggest you do that anyway in their adds.

Life is often painful and lonely.... and that's just the way it is.  Do the best you can to enjoy what you do... and do not feel badly about the loneliness, but rather enjoy it as a gentle and often constant reminder that who one is, is a Perfect Soul that is exploring Life.  Each of us is simply fulfilling the Purpose of Life, and occasionally doing that is less than enjoyable.<br>  <br>  Peace|`|38852752ccd0ae855afeb5b23f504950aa	So it seems that you have took on some good responses such as being able to act happy,giving up the thought of suicide...Yes,time does heal depression.I have dealt with a personal issue for over 4 years and only recently did I let it go but not fully.I can't answer the question fully since I have never heard of anything like this before but what I can tell you is a few things.try making new friends and conversate with them as if you knew each other for a long time.Ask them about them and let them as you questions but in anything you have to be honest.Otherwise it will "undertone of depression" may be around forever but you have to learn to trust people that you feel is the right people to trust who you can build a good friendship with.Have you seen a dr and try taking meds?Meds can be a pain but if you want to get better you have to do the work.|`|Z12yoRu2aa	I sent you an email|`|WHK6q2aeaa	When i am alone i do not think of anything negative always positive.The reason i had a depression few years back but some times you can get out of it by yourself and sometimes can't.First thing you have to do is to have a good friend the is going to listen to you and hears what isw bothering you.What is best is to go to a counselor<br>  somebody that is not going to judge you and somebody that doesn't know you.But what i am saying you live once and you have to have faith and don't  never give up!

Why would you want to continue like this if you know you can be treated? While I certainly am against handing these pills out like candy, there are people such as yourself and myself that do benefit from the treatment.There may come a day when you will not be able to stop spiralling down hill and my friend I would not just sit and wait for that to happen. I did and it cost me many years of heartache, and not just to myself. Don't wait any longer. Isn't it worth a try if you can have your life back and one that you don't even know exists yet. There are many people who do need medicine. A diabetic would not hesitate to be treated, why should you? Think of yourself for a change and not the stigma of all this. This is your life to live, so live it!  Good mental health

nAp688tZaa	Neurontin does not cause weight gain in most people. As long as you remain as active as you were and eat the same as you did prior to the medication being started, you should see no weight gain.  I take this med for my seizures, along with another, and have not noticed any weight gain.  I have been on it for nearly 10 months now, so if it was going to happen, it would have already.

zNn9VfRyaa	to lose weight u need to eat right and have a workout plan 5-6 days a week.u have to want it. <br>  ***try this u need to change ur diet. <br>  eat six times a day. ea of ur 3 main meals needs to combine a lean protein such as chicken breast ground turkey turkey bacon egg whts also combine that with a complex carb such as a baked potato or sweet potato wild rice brown rice oatmeal or girts. also add fresh fruit and vegies to lunch and dinner. pick fruits low in sugar like pears and berries. if u get canned vegies get ones with low sodium. eat every 3-4 hrs keep ur metablism moving.<br>  ***also the most important part is WATER drink at least 64oz. no soda or juice. water will curve ur cravings. <br>  u need to hit cardio 3-4 times a week running outside it great workout if u can hit a gym and cardio machine is great at least 30mins***<br>  also add weight/strength training 3 times a week.u can google free weight traning guides anywhere. its not hard to find things for free.<br>  ***plan ur meals ahead of time.always have a healthy snack with u so u wont be tempted to eat fast food. also if u wait to late to eat u will get so hungry u will eat the world. make time to work out start out with 30 mins then increase.its ur body treat it right. ur diet alone can help lose weight but working out makes ur body look good. shows muscles and tight skin which is sexy and beautful. stick with it ur body will amaze u!!! to be healthy and look great u need both in ur life. good luck email me if u have further questions|`|9zLhZHRCaa	eat healthier and make sure you workout everyday because your body is used to it
e962QoBTaa	err... You DON'T need fat in a specific area to grow muscle there (I have NO idea at all how the heck you reached that conclusion, the only thing you get then are "manboobs" at the most). If you want your chest muscles to grow, work them out to the limit (until they feel sore) on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. When they feel sore it is because the muscles have been slightly damaged because of the training, and they will then rebuild themselves next time you sleep, to become healed, and stronger, for the next time you exercise (Do not make the mistake of exercising them everyday. The muscles will grow while you sleep, not in the gym).<br>  <br>  Also, where the fat will place itself is completely genetical.
249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|CDbzfSGhaa	Eat well, no pop/soda, no cakes,candy or bad foods, walking, walking, and walking up steep hills can help too.

AuVdMXbkaa	i would recommend one of the GNCs either protein formulas or plain weight gainer. If you don't normally eat a ton i would gradually increase the amount of the shake. Working out is a great way to gain weight and it is a lot easier to burn fat into muscle than just gain muscle so the weight gainer probably will aid in burning down to muscle.  One very important thing is that if you regularly eat snacks during the day in between meals you need to stop or at least limit that. It may seem that this will make you lose weight but just eat the snack later with your meal, by eating many snacks in between meals your body is constantly working at the food all day giving your metabolism an easy long time for it to work at the food, if you eat your 3 meals and a lot at each one your body will have less time and your metabolism should be slow enough where your food can be burned into muscle at a good rate. Also it is very important to take the GNC weight gainer ^after^ you work out otherwise working out can be painful.<br>  Hope that helps =)|`|6dff9c8d78f35f9cfa54823794d13d08aa	well, first don't get protein stuff, that won't help you gain weight. <br>  get junk food. lol

AA12166503	I have done Weight Watchers as well and you have to pace yourself.  You can overdo it.  Doing too much won't produce result you want.  When you first start out you sometimes lose a lot at once and then level off for a while.  Your metabolism has to adjust to your new weight and eating plan.<br>  <br>  One thing you can do is find how much calories certain exercises burn versus how many calories you eat in a day.<br>  <br>  WW is a great plan and so much more flexible now.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|Vygr0YqYaa	Hi its not just exercising you need to do, its healthy eating also.

XGsuxRR2aa	200 does seem high, I'd more worry about what your heart rate is normally at when not exercising first. If you're out of shape and your heart is normally beating at a higher than average rate, it's having to pump extra extra fast when you're exercising. If you are pushing yourself too hard, that might be it too. I'd suggest cardiovascular exercises if your heart usually beats faster than what is normal for most people, just to get it in more shape-- so it pumps more efficiently.

AuTmKSjVaa	Just use what you've got man!<br>  A little imagination and sex toys will bring you more fun than struggling with your anxiety and small portions.|`|AA11785060	Buy some Dark chocolate M&Ms if they are available in your country. If not, just eat lots of regular M&Ms.  They will have as much effect on penis growth as anything else you can buy, and at least taste good. There are no known drugs that actually cause body appendages like your  penis to grow. But loads of pills are available to gullible people willing to part with their money. Most are just some harmless filler products that have no physical effect on your body, but some have been known to actually have harmful chemicals in them.  Stick with the M&Ms.|`|vY0ScgeXaa	i dont think their known penis enlargment pills.<br>  <br>  penis can only be enlarged thru a small surgery, to remove 3 ligaments attached to your testicles, so that your penis could be fully exposed, this will normally enlarge your penis by 1 to 2 inches.<br>  <br>  but do try CVS, walgreens, etc, if they don't have it and it's not OTC, obviously you have to consider the enlargement surgery.|`|ZkwtldYlaa	You should be happy with what you have.<br>  <br>  However if you really feel the need to increase your penis size,then you should try out these :<br>  <br>  Here are four good natural penis enhancement techniques I recommend for rookies. Done properly and consistently, they should add close to an inch or two to your penis in six weeks.<br>  <br>  1. Penis stretches. This one is very simple. Just take your flaccid penis and stretch it as far out in front of your body as it will go. Do it gently and gradually and hold it there for thirty seconds. Rest ten seconds between sets and repeat this at least ten times.<br>  <br>  2. Jelqing. This is another great technique for rookies. Get your penis halfway erect, apply lubrication, and grip it tightly at the base with the thumb and forefinger of one hand. Slowly slide that hand up the shaft toward the tip, pushing as much blood into your penis as possible. When you reach the tip, immediately grip the base the same way using the other hand and repeat. Do this nonstop for ten minutes.<br>  <br>  3. Ulis. This is a great exercise to increase girth. It is also very easy and does not take much time. Achieve a full erection and grip the base of your penis the same way you would if you were jelqing. <br>  <br>  Squeeze as hard as you can without causing discomfort. Your penis shaft should swell and your penis head should get big and shiny. Hold for ten seconds and rest for ten seconds. Repeat this three or four times.<br>  <br>  Do this routine every other day and make sure you warm your penis up before each workout by wrapping it in a hot washcloth for five minutes.<br>  <br>  4. A larger penis can be achieved with the use of penis enhancers. There are many forms of penis enhancement products such as pills, patches and topical oils. However, one unique natural product that can produce significant results and makes use of the body's natural abilities comes in the form of a liquid called super-vir <a href="http://www.super-vir.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-vir.com</a><br>  <br>  Always remember, if you are not satisfied with what you were born with, it is never too late to do something about it!|`|4IC78le4aa	Are you kidding me? Things like that dont actually work. They are a rip to get your money and nothing to show for it (sorry about the pun, lol).<br>  <br>  Look, I am a 35 year old female and I have seen penises big and small. Its not all about size (although I wont lie and tell you that girls dont get excited when their guy is hung) but it is more about your skills and what you do with what you have got.<br>  <br>  I have dated some "small" guys who were wonderful in bed - because they were lacking in size they made extra effort in other areas and taking care of the female's needs with their hands and mouth  - get my drift?  I didnt once wish they had a big dick!<br>  <br>  Just accept what you have and learn to be a better lover and knock those big boys out of the picture with your skill and enthusiasm!<br>  <br>  If after what I have told you, you are still bothered then go see a doctor who specialises in penis enlargement - they can add a few centimetres on to the length for you but its kind of a drastic way in handling what God gave you.|`|nhJo81Kpaa	best buy?
mTSYemNgaa	I just had a decompression and fusion last month. It did alleviate my pain. I had sciatic pain 24 hours a day since last July. I had a few of the shots that didn't work.<br>  I think that mine was L5, S2... I think.<br>  I have a really good doctor. I think that's key. He specializes in spinal surgeries. <br>  I'd suggest that you talk to other doctors or former patients or surgical techs about your doctor to see if they know if he's a good doctor.<br>  Prayer wouldn't hurt either.<br>  Take Care|`|3jFm0rWdaa	I have treated many people with these conditions with excellent results with diversified chiropractic care, plus stretching and massage.<br>  If you haven't, try it before surgery.  Surgery can relieve pain, but make you even stiffer, and sometimes the pain doesn't decrease at all - use it only as a truly last resort.

Life is good... Speak up!|`|yWRZDGfcaa	Are you afraid of saying something bad, as in mean or rude?  or are you afraid of saying the wrong thing, and that people will laugh or judge you for it?<br>  <br>  If you're just worried about talking and drawing attention to yourself you might have social anxiety.<br>  <br>  I had moderate social anxiety in high school and was afraid of being called on in class and reading aloud.  The reading part was especially silly because when I was younger I loved showing off my reading skills.  It would come and go but the main fear was that I would say something idiotic or unintentionally rude and that people would end up judging me or gossiping about it. There were other symptoms too, but these are the ones that are similar to your question.<br>  <br>  If you feel like that could be it, then try to see a psychologist about it if you can.  If that's too pricey, a family practice doctor can rx anxiety medication.   Make sure you discuss anything you're taking like medications, vitamins, or even illegal drugs (your doctor won't rat you out to anyone if you are over 18)  ADHD meds can especially be the cause of anxiety.<br>  <br>  IF YOU ARE SIMPLY WORRIED OF BEING UNINTENTIONALLY RUDE OR MEAN (sorry but I did the caps in case my first part was inapplicable and you're skimming) I would suggest thinking through things like opinions carefully before you say them.  Some people are more sensitive emotionally than others.  Sometimes just a tone of voice or way something is worded can offend some people.    Also, if you just find yourself being accidentally offensive frequently, just tell people that before you have a serious conversation with them! I know it sounds a little silly, but then they will be prepared and hopefully not jump to conclusions.   A reasonable person will at least try to accommodate that.<br>  <br>  Remember though that some people are just waiting to be offended, and no matter what you say to them they are going to react like you just called their grandmother a whore.  If you're just offending one person frequently and not everyone else they might be one of those people.  <br>  <br>  I hope one of those questions I answered was the correct one, and good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and I'm sorry if I offended anyone with promiscuous grandmothers or that may be one etc, etc! ;)|`|bBBcbFmWaa	I know what you mean 100%. My first reaction to stress is to isolate because I don't want to share the "crazy" thoughts that ALWAYS seem to slip out and offend and scare people.  So here are my thoughts:<br>  <br>  Maybe think  of your breathing as good clean air that comes in and neutralizes the bad energy inside you and then you breathe out and blow it all away. Kinda like air fresheners or  like the tide at the beach. Breathe in. Let the Air Mix In and Clean Bad Engergy. Breathe Out.  Even if you don't think it will work, just thinking about your breathing is a good way to slow down and calm yourself before you react. <br>  <br>  Try something like this because hiding in your house with the phones unplugged and no outside contact until your family calls the cops because they think you are dead is a real drag. Believe me, you do not want to have to explain that situation; they will not think it's funny and will bring it up again and again at family gatherings. <br>  <br>  Best to try the deep breaths.|`|HdzKRlsiaa	Every night, when you're alone, scream all the bad things and words you can think of into a pillow.

JO7jPJPhaa	You should get yourself a sextoy. It should be something reasonably sized and that uses standard batteries (AAA,AA,C). A needed accessory to any sextoy is lubrication.

AA10450066	Those are probably your adenoids.MRSA means that at some point you were on an antibiotic for a long period of time, or had the same antibiotic for allot of infections.You can also get it if you were written antibiotics and never took the full amount, stopping because you felt better. Anyway your body has built up a tolerance to regular antibiotics so that when you get an infection the doctor has to write a stronger one for it to help.Once this happens you are then considered a carrier and all health care people should be told.It's the same as if you had something like hepatitis C.It's something that antone taking care of you needs to know.

YCmvBc05aa	Just brush and floss your teeth as you would normally.<br>  <br>  Also, rinse with luke warm salt water (1 pinch of salt in 1 glass of the water). <br>  <br>  The slightest amount of salt kills germs. So, you'll be fine until you see the doctor.<br>  <br>  You don't want too much salt though because it will be too caustic to the tissue.<br>  <br>  Also, don't use water that is too hot.<br>  <br>  Good luck !!

CnGR2xeoaa	Nausea is a typical symptom post surgery when a general anesthetic is used. However the nausea usually only lasts a day or two. <br>  Nausea is also a typical side effect of many prescription pain killers, especially if taken on an empty stomach or if the dose is too large.<br>  Try taking the meds with food next time, since your stomach is a bit weak right now try sticking with something light. Also be sure to take lots of fluids. If this doesn't help then call your doctor to see if he can change your prescription or if the nausea is caused by something else.|`|AA11813527	You really should call your doctor. You could be having a reaction the the anesthesia. Plus pain pills can often cause nausea and vomiting. Often doctors prescribe promethazaine or a similar medication for nausea associated with nausea and vomiting that comes with pain medications like narcotics. I work as a Nurse Practitioner in the emergency room. And more often than not I will order phenerghan-promethazine along with pain medications to cut down on the nausea. It can also help them to work better. These medications come in tablet, suppository, and injections . If you can not call your doctor on the weekend. Go to the emergency room, they will help you. But have some one else drive you as these medications can cause you to become drowsy and you should not drive.<br>  <br>  I hope you feel better!<br>  Kali :-)<br>  Nurse Practitioner|`|bvYPr0Cvaa	It could be from not eating anything with the painkillers, or it could be the painkillers themselves making you sick. I know when i was in the hospital having my daughter, every painkiller they gave me made me vomit. Finally about the time i got discharged from the hospital they gave me hydrocodone, that was the only one that didn't make me sick. You might try eating with the painkillers and see if that helps, if it doesn't then check with your doctor and see if they can prescribe something else. Best of luck to you!!!

fk9AvB25aa	Cold sores are contagious and they can be passed to the genitals when you have oral sex with some one that has cold sores. That happened to me so it's possible. Cold sores don't cause genital herpes (HSV2) but they are caused by HSV1 and they are very contagious while they are active. Even if he just had an out break just once, he still has the virus in his body all the time (he will have it for life) and has a small chance of passing them when there are no symptoms. There is more of a chance of passing them on if he gave you oral sex when he had any signs of an out break.<br>  If he lies constantly then don't trust him when it comes to things like that.... You can try to get tested for herpes at planned parent hood or at a free clinic.|`|dtzlrB9Faa	Cold sore can be transferred to the genitals during oral sex.  You would then have HSV1-genitally.  If this is the case your outbreaks would be less than if you had HSV2.  It's possible you have a mild case of hereps-which usually happens if it's HSV1 genitally-because it is NOT the site of preference-the mouth is. <br>  <br>  The only way to be sure is to get tested.  Good luck!!!|`|LrGmpacOaa	Even if he did have cold sores, it's unlikely he gave you herpes.<br>  <br>  Cold sores are caused by herpes 1, and genital herpes by herpes 2. They don't usually cross-infect each other's territory. It does happen, but it's uncommon.<br>  <br>  It also doesn't sound like herpes. Herpes lesions don't just disappear. They hurt and hurt and slowly disappear over a couple weeks.<br>  <br>  If you're worried, try and find a free clinic. They are around. But I think you're probably fine.
1NK1hK1Taa	You sound like you are mad. Acting isn't just down to facial expressions. There are plenty of people who are very successful actors and actresses who are fat and have fat faces. What you lack is confidence and belief in yourself. Your 'chubby cheeks' are part of you. Accept it. I'm sure the people around you have. Why not ask your friends what they think. I'm sure they will tell you the shape of your face doesn't enter their minds. They will think of you as a whole, not a chubby face. Confidence comes from within, not what is on the outside. If you just concentrate on the outside, that is being superficial, and you don't sound like that sort of person. <br>  I don't think you can lose fat from your face as part of a diet, but just diet and lose it from wherever it drops off. You can tone up your facial muscles by making those 'eee' 'ooo' 'uuu' faces. Try the site below. Just remember, the shape of your face is just that. You can be confident whatever the shape!
vWm1l9nuaa	Because that is the best treatment available today. A few years back rectal cancer had a very poor prognosis.

It's a very normal practice.<br>  <br>  I hope it goes well. My thoughts are with you!|`|HfBLQ4sQaa	listen to the doctors, they know best!!<br>  If they do surgery, that removes part of the tumor/cancer<br>  insted of doing another surgery they put you on chemo and raidiation.|`|AA10176134	I know how scared and confused you are right now. This is a normal feeling. I was daignosed with stage 3 colon cancer July 2007. Colon cancer doesn't require radiation. Rectal cancer is different because the doctor needs to shrink the tumor before operating. Then once you get the surgery your rectum can be saved and you wont need a permanent bag. I am assuming they want to give you chemo first so the cancer cells do not have the opportunity to travel to other parts of the body. <br>  This is not going to be easy physically or emotionally but you will do it and feel like your old self again. <br>  You are so fortunate to catch this at satge 2! <br>  They will probably give you the 5fu chemo treatment via a port in your chest. Make sure you get genetic testing and the KRAS test.<br>  I will pray for you! Hang in there. BTW, I don't smoke, drink or drugs  either, that is why I was so angry too!
lkIcWsT3aa	The muscles that you want to develop are your pectoral muscles. Common basic exercises are push ups and bench presses. However don't just focus on these two exercises, make sure you work out your whole body over the course of 3-5 days so that your body will develop more muscle. When you develop more muscle overall you will burn your weight off faster.<br>  <br>  Keep working out consistantly and in time you will see changes. I would say at least 2-3 months of regular exercise and you should see some results.|`|BGRaT8jTaa	Your man boobs are going no place because you fail to understand the meaning of proper cardiovascular...ok....dude...walking around is a waiste of time.

d3VV4b6vaa	black skin is actually MORE susceptible for melanoma, the deadliest type of skin cancer.  sunscreens are not an 100% effective measurement in dealing with this. in fact many studies are now showing sunscreens do nothing against melanoma, and in fact may increase cancer risk becuase of all the other harmful ingredients in them...but they may help with benign cancers.  <br>  that doesn't make sense to use a suntan lotion (one that assists in getting a tan) and a sunscreen (used to block the UV rays)  I personally think suntan oils are best, as they usually consist of ingredients that will not make you burn, as healthy skin DOES tan. its your bodies way of protecting you. they usually contain natural ingredients too, like coconut oil which filters out the harmful rays. skin that does not tan, or just burns is not healthy skin/body.<br>  please read this:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/019428.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalnews.com/019428.html</a>|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	Black skin can STILL burn, and must be protected...the lighter the skin the higher the risk.|`|pmlg4GAsaa	Yeah, it sure seems like that, seeing as the melanin in black people's skin protects them from radiation and prevents sunburn and skin cancer.  But maybe there's a risk for you too, albeit a smaller one.  I would research it more.

0TT5q0cUaa	An anal fistula is an abnormal communication between the anal canal or rectum and the perianal skin. This communication is formed by a tract, which in lay terms may be likened to a tunnel. This tract extends from the internal opening in the anal canal or rectum to the external opening in the perianal skin. The most common cause is infection of an anal gland resulting in a perianal abscess. This abscess may drain or rupture externally and heal. Alternatively it may rupture externally as well as internally into the anal canal or rectum and form a fistula. The fistulous tract is continuously infected by faeces from the rectum and therefore does not heal. However, the external opening may close from time to time resulting in abscess formation and is the cause of pain. This abscess subsequently ruptures with the relief of pain and the reformation of the fistula. Unless treated this may recur over several years. <br>  <br>  Very rarely anal fistulae may be due to tuberculosis, diverticular disease or other inflammatory disease of the colon. A fistula may be either 'low' or 'high'. In a low fistula the internal opening is below the anal sphincter while in a high fistula it is above the sphincter. The anal sphincter is responsible for faecal continence. The vast majority of anal fistula are low and are easy to treat.<br>  <br>  Treatment is by surgery. A low fistula can be laid open or cut open so that it can drain freely and heal. However, a high fistula cannot be laid open as the anal sphincter will be damaged and will result in incontinence. Here a nylon thread is passed through the tract and tied and left for several weeks to allow free drainage and eventual healing of fistula. More than one operation may be necessary for the cure of a difficult fistula-in-ano.|`|44BEm1Uhaa	Anal fistulas are fairly common in people who have had an anal abscess.

Xa9wiUnXaa	I had to get a mole removed due to the questionable size and growth of it (it wasn't really that bad mind you, it just was slightly raised from the skin) and it was actually just above my butt. As much as you say having a doctor look at it isn't an option, its the only option. Something like that you're not going to find the answer on the internet if its okay or not. Growths or developments on the skin are not something that should be ignored or left as they can worse before they can get better.
dN1d8cuNaa	The currently approved NuvaRing regimen specifies insertion of the ring into the vagina for a three-week period, then removal of the ring for one week, during which the user will experience a menstrual period. The break week with NuvaRing is comparable to the placebo week for combined oral contraceptive pills ("the Pill"), and the contraceptive effect is maintained during this period. Extended use regimens (7-week, quarterly, or annual) involving back-to-back use of (2, 4, or 17) rings have been studied in clinical trials, but are not currently approved.<br>  <br>  Insertion of the ring is comparable to insertion of other vaginal rings. The muscles of the vagina keep NuvaRing securely in place, even during exercise or sex. Women can check the contraceptive ring periodically with their finger. In rare instances, NuvaRing may fall out during sexual intercourse, while straining during a bowel movement, or while removing a tampon.<br>  <br>  Contraceptive efficacy is not reduced if the ring is removed or accidentally expelled and is left outside of the vagina for less than three hours. If the ring has been out of the vagina for more than three continuous hours, contraceptive efficacy may be reduced and a backup method of contraception must be used until the ring has been used continuously for a subsequent seven days.|`|MoK5vTjWaa	It is birth control that your doctor inserts once a month.

ZjhQ6PL8aa	I've heard of this for some colleges all though it's more prevalent for things like online classes.  Often times when you take a leave of absence it's more designed for when your in a specific career program where you can pick up when the next class gets to that part.  Best thing to do would be to contact student services and ask them as they know more about your specific college.

YCXxP43Laa	The racing and scattered thoughts could well be indicative of bipolar, but the mood swings seem a little to quick to change for that.<br>  <br>  When I first saw a psychiatirist they thought I may have a personlaity disorder due to the fact that I had an eating disorder when young, and cut myself when depressed... but before I could have further assessment I suffered a breakdown, was hosptialised and diagnoses with bipolar.  I've just seen the first psychiatrist who reviewed my diagnosis and agreed it was bipolar.. due to the fact I have been very manic this week.<br>  <br>  I live in England too, and was in hospital with people who have BPD, they are quite obvious to spot, an even my original psychiatrist agreed that I don't fit the criteria for it, though I recognise a lot of the symptoms.<br>  <br>  You've been giving wrong advice regarding the lack of facilities for BPD, there is help available. Obvioulsy it depends how badly it affects your life. It is the mental condition most likely to cause admission into a mental hopsital... far beyond bipolar and schizophrenia. But two people I know very well are treated differently.<br>  <br>  You should be sent to complex needs; it is a long process but would help you. You can also get something called direct payments; these are set up by your CPN or social worker or whoever is dealing with yoru case. They are payments that allow you to undergo classes or activities that help you to have structure to your day.<br>  <br>  DBT is a therapy specifically desgined for BPD, but in England it is not available in all health authorities, although cognitive behavioural therapy is, and should be offered to you... or demand it; you are entitled to it.<br>  <br>  You are suffering from psychotic features, and these should be explored further. You can have BPD and bipolar at the same time, sometimes one leads to the other.<br>  <br>  Keep pressing for help, you are entitled and it is rubbish that they don't help those with BPD, it used to be the case but isn't anymore. They are fobbing you off. <br>  <br>  Mention the racing thoughts as they are similar to bipolar; and if your sleep patterns vary greatly it is more likely.<br>  <br>  Good luck and demand further evaluation

p2iLuTyVaa	remind yourself why you are doing it, and that you will get results<br>  <br>  also, you could give yourself a realistic target say, every week, about how much weight you want to have lost, or something? this will help you stay motivated and on the right track<br>  <br>  people sometimes eat because of boredom, and the hardest thing to change on a diet is eating habits<br>  try to snack less by distracting yourself, or doing something everytime you want a snack. obviously if you feel really hungry and have to get something, make it healthy like fruit, yoghurt, or nuts. green tea is also really good as it makes you feel full and your not intaking many calories.<br>  <br>  its hard to stay to an exercise regime, but if you start doing about 5-10 minutes a day it wont feel like much, and you can gradually increase it. exercise triggers endorphines in the brain which means you actually start to crave exercise so its less of a struggle the more you do it<br>  some exercises you could try which are easy to begin with are: step ups, press ups, sit ups, light jogging, yoga, squat sits<br>  <br>  but please remember, you dont need to lose a lot of weight as being skinny isnt perfection <br>  i hope these help and you find it easier<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  :)|`|reAtqf0Maa	well you could start out simple first. like for the first few days cut back a bit. maybe don't have that dressing on the salad. or have water instead of soda. stuff like that. start simple. then slowly go to the diet part. where you have a apple instead of a brownie. or yogurt instead ofice creamm. then start exercising and dieting. this is a slow process but much simpler because you can adjust easier.<br>  <br>  <br>  now for fast weight lose )like what your doing to keep motivated) do this. take ten exercises you can do at home and crank you favorite tunes while doing this. like this<br>  <br>  1.sit ups<br>  2. jumping jacks<br>  3. squat thrusts (squats but push your arms out when you squat then pull them back in, basically getting arms in volved in squats<br>  4. crunches<br>  5.push ups( on your knees if you have to but fininsh the set)<br>  6. on your hands and knees and kick a leg back  (for the but)<br>  7.elbow to knee crunches ( for obliques)<br>  8.side leg lifts<br>  9. stand up and kick a leg forward while puching arms out forward<br>  10.get on back with legs in air then bring on leg to the stomack to the other.<br>  <br>  do eack of there for one minute and DON'T take breaks in between them. the only break you should take is switching from each e xercise. it should only take a few seconds to switch though. do these for as long as you can. after you do all ten have some water and start up again. i recomend this you do this 3-6 times a day which will give you a 30 - 60 min workout. do it longer if you can! <br>  <br>  <br>  whenever you feel like eating some junk food you have to get your mind off it. play a computer game. watch tv. read a book. exercise. if the craving is so bad then have something healtthy and you will feel great after knowign you stayed strong!  this will keep you motivated.<br>  <br>  know you need to learn to love dieting. for instance, strawberries are very healthy for you. if you love them then keep them in the house more so you can have more yummy healthy food to eat from when you are hungry. <br>  <br>  know besides diet and exercise i recomend you drink green tea. it helps me lose weight while i am dieting and exercising! also eat celery. it is has lots of vitamin and minerals and it will keep you full! also it has water in it so it makes it a great diet food!<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  :)|`|2RzEaod9aa	Well, Niki, the way to stay motivated is to focus on health, to focus on seeing things YOU want to see in your body. Your goal relies ENTIRELY on other people. Your only goal is to have people compliment you next year at school. Think about it...do you really want to place your happiness in the hands of total strangers? Of course not.<br>  <br>  For me, I fell in love with weight training. Even though people like to discourage me because I'm a woman, I still pursue it. I absolutely love it and I do it for ME, and that's what keeps me going. That's what has me in the gym at 4am before work. That's what keeps me eating properly. That's what got me to quit smoking (nicotine inhibits muscle synthesis). That's what makes me excited when I throw up in the middle of my workout. That's what has me flexing in every mirror I pass. I do this for ME, and that's what keeps me motivated.<br>  <br>  <br>  Until you're doing this for YOU, you'll never be motivated. You know why? Because your mind doesn't like to rely on others for satisfaction.

Your Obgyn is a doctor and a proffessional, so there's nothing to be embarassed about. She may insert a finger into your vagina. This does not hurt and is done in a very professional manner. Nothing that happens at the Ongyn should hurt. If it does, tell her immediately because it could signal that something is wrong.

When I got my braces, they gave me a little mouth piece to wear, it wasn't a full mouth piece, but it was just something to bite on, it helped with the pain.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped :D|`|Cq1Qsg8Vaa	Unfortunately, the only real thing you can do for the pain is Motrin or Tylenol.

LxqM6j7jaa	Yes you need antibiotics. If you do have a strep infection it may well go away by itself however there are reasons we give antibiotics to patients with strep infections even if they are healthy. Strep is a nasty little bug that can cause a host of other syndromes and diseases if allowed to sit in your system for a period of time. Rheumatic fever which can affect the heart and your bones as well as acute glomerulonephritis which is a kidney disease. While these are uncommon in the U.S. today they are easily prevented by limiting the time the strep is in your system. However if they do develop there is little in the way of treatment. Most antibiotics are safe and inexpensive. I would go to your physician.|`|cdd57d1b18b8d82168928705079633ecaa	With symptoms like those I would visit the doctor's.

Have a strep test done to see if it's really strep throat or something viral. If it's a virus antibiotics won't do any good anyway, and you shouldn't take them unless you really need to. If it's bacterial then an antibiotic will help you to kick the illness. But you won't know for sure unless you have a strep test done.|`|0psCy0XXaa	I would have the anti biotics if i was you.

This is good news, and will be easy to treat.<br>  <br>  An doctor can better advise you to what you need to take. There is no point in self medicating as you'll often over, or under dose or take the wrong medication for ssomethingyou don't need to take medication for. The last thing you need is to build up a tolerance and then really need it when your 80.|`|2COaydcfaa	yeah I know what you mean I always avoid medicine if I can, however from what you have said I think you do need antibiotics.|`|JPa0GzDjaa	They'd probably give you a weeks worth of antibiotics to clear the infection. <br>  <br>  It would be a good idea to go to the doctors.|`|u3CEObEMaa	yes you have strep throat i had it more than 6 times you need a doctor and penicillan fast becasue it can spread throughout your body quickly if you dont get medicine its not a cold.|`|ho0JgShXaa	i think you should take antibiotics go to the doctor he will give you some,if you wait it could become worse and you could end up having surgery|`|KxqV7CM7aa	I think you need to go to the doctor. If your throat is really sore and you have muscle aches etc. it could be flu which is viral and antibiotics will NOT help. Only a culture can really tell if it is strep or a bacterial infection. If it is viral it will run its course in 7-14 days usually. <br>  <br>  That said if you are able to see white pustules on the back of your throat then get on antibiotics. Penicillin is best for strep as is amoxocyllin and many other broad spectrum antibiotics. If you do not have insurance, like me, then one option is online consult/prescription. I recently used www.netmedorders.com to get antibiotics and they are filled in a US pharmacy and shipped FedEx and cost me less than it would have cost had I gone to a doctor and paid for that and a prescription. <br>  <br>  BUT I know a lot about medicine. If you need advice about which antibiotics also look on www.drugs.com before buying any meds from a site like www.netmedorders.com though the site should only sell safe drugs. I am still awaiting more feedback on the site but so far it is a great site for those of us who need any medications but do not have insurance BUT do know exactly what we need. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you in either event and remember a doctor is always the best bet but if you do not have insurance then by all means I would recommend a place like www.netmedorders.com and checking any interactions with other drugs you may have on www.drugs.com|`|MxZy5cOWaa	well i just recovered from strep throat so let me tell you what to do....i had the exact same symptoms as you did. and when strep throat isn't cured by a doctor it becomes deadly. when you get sick your body produces more antibodies to kill off the bacteria. so when you get strep they start to kill off the bacteria. the only problem is that the strep bacteria look very similar to your heart valves. so once all of the antibodies are done killing off strep they start to eat away at your heart valves because they think it is strep.  so as a result you can develop a disease that is called rheumatic heart disease or Rheumatic Fever.  which can only be resolved in open heart surgery....<br>  <br>  <br>  so to answer your question yes...go to the doctor immediately and get a strep test

xfgVGqvXaa	My understanding is that other people can smell ketones on your breath.  You can't detect the smell on your own breath because you get used to it.  I don't think you notice a distinctive taste.<br>  <br>  It's a bit like alcohol.  If you drink alcohol, other people might notice the smell on your breath, but you can't detect it yourself.  Similarly, there will be alcohol in your saliva, but you don't notice the taste because it will be there for several hours--until you've sobered up.<br>  <br>  If your body is producing ketones, they will be present in your urine and can be detected chemically.  So, if you really want to know whether you are experiencing ketosis, you could buy some urine test strips.  I think that's about the only way to be sure.<br>  <br>  Why do you want to experience ketosis?  If you want to lose weight, you'd be better trying to do it slowly and steadily.  If you starve yourself, you'll end up feeling ill, and you'll be more likely to put the weight back on later.
iw9yogtMaa	Yes, it is the right thing to do.<br>  What a waste it would be to discard these stem cells because of the incorrect religious conclusion that to use them in any other way would be to waste a potential life.<br>  <br>  First of all, the embryonic stem cells in question are those that will be discarded - thrown away - if they are not used for research.  They are the ones that will NOT be used in any other way.  Which means that the only wasted life would be that of the person who must suffer or die because the potential treatment never developed.  Because the research was not allowed/supported or because the FDA wouldn't get around to reviewing the submitted documentation, many people have already died or progressed beyond a point of return.<br>  <br>  The stem cells will be used for research, whether or not they will be successful for Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease remains to be seen.  They may be very successful for at least one form of Diabetes and a host of other diseases and conditions including some cancers and some cardiac conditions.<br>  <br>  By allowing this use, universities no longer have to keep separate labs for separate funding sources etc. which they have had to do since 2001.  This in itself will be a huge savings of often difficult to find money expecially in the light of the Madoff financial collapse.<br>  <br>  I think it is a mistake to confuse pseudo religion with medical ethics. <br>  This is not about misuse of tissue but about the potential to develop methods to save many lives.  Since 2001 the Bush policy has been to throw out the baby with the bath water in order to play footsie with the religous right.<br>  <br>  It's time to get our priorities in order.  The right thing to do is to recycle those embryonic stem cells for good and not to thrown them in the trash as has the old policy dictated.  <br>  <br>  Although Congress attempted to overturn the executive orders on at least two occasions, the bills were vetoed.  On Monday, President Obama is expected to sign executive orders which will permit the (salvage) use of embryonic stem cells for research (to save lives.)<br>  <br>  Be aware also that only some areas of research were restricted.  Privately funded research, companies with no federal funding could do that research so we have not been set back as much as it might seem.  The problem is, I have heard, that the FDA informed those companies that it would be a cold day...before their proposals would receive approval.<br>  <br>  Scientists are probably pretty decent medical ethicists...far better than politicians.<br>  <br>  Good question.|`|AA10301974	Yes, I don't have any problems with the use of embryos for medical science.|`|Pld2h24Aaa	If this was allowed, No one would die of diseases, just age accidents and violence.  This would be AWESOME!!!<br>  Stem cells should have been legalized the second they were discovered to make organs that may need replacing.  <br>  But no, the government has to be a bunch of tight wad prudes that won't let stem cells be funded by the government.
krgtMHx7aa	I have never heard of a woman having hair in her vagina, maybe you should see a doctor.  Now if you are talking about the hair on your vulva many times if you shave and don't use a good shave gel you will get the little pimple things.  Usually they are ingrown hairs.  Waxing can solve that problem.|`|J4W68owgaa	It's probably ingrown hairs and irritation, not actual pimples, although they look similar. I've been shaving for years and believe it or not, it does get better. There are some tricks to it though:<br>  <br>  1. Go slow, I mean really slow.<br>  2. Get a really good shaving cream<br>  3. Shave first with the hair growth, then go the opposite direction.<br>  4. Go to Target/Wal-Mart/K-mart and get some Bikini Zone. It's by the shaving cream. Apply that immediately after shaving.<br>  5. Use a super sharp razor<br>  <br>  I wouldn't recommend waxing, only because it hurts like a b****!! Also, you have to let the hair regrow roughly 1/4 inch before you can wax again. In a few days, those bumps should go away, don't try to shave again until they do because you'll probably irritate them and make them worse. <br>  <br>  Good luck and hope that helps|`|RHCUtrxnaa	You have ingrown hairs. You can call them pimples if you want, but in reality they aren't. I'm a male and I shave too. I do not use a razor because of what you have experienced. I would suggest using a beard and mustache trimmer. I use one and it gets very close, but without the bumps.<br>  <br>  If you're doing this for guys, you don't need to get skin-close. The vast majority of guys do not care if you're shaved (skin-close). On the other hand, the vast majority of guys like a trimmed girl. If you personally do not care whether you have hair or not, just trim so it show good hygiene. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you choose to use a razor again, when you're done, apply a hot washcloth to it for a few minutes after. It will help with the bumps, but it may not prevent them. FYI, DO NOT put aftershave, rubbing alcohol or anything like that. You will cause pain you will wish you never felt.|`|dazBEG9waa	Waxing is better and last longer, but if you want to shave don't shave it when it's still very short because it erritates the skin.
pjYQhPPBaa	Sounds like TMJ. This has been happening to me for years, until recently when it really started actually hurting. I spoke with my dentist about it (though I haven't seen him because I'm at college) and he said it sounds exactly like TMJ. The most likely cause of this pain is you grinding your teeth at night.<br>  <br>  Since this has been happening for a week, you should make an appointment to see your dentist. There is a good chance he'll say TMJ and you'll have to wear a night guard for a while.

L3Tc39cuaa	hi, firstly i totally understand how u feel. you answered one of my questions on the same subject. Where  you are now is the worst kind of pain imaginable. you have lost the most important person to you and on top of that they are all conspiring against you and making it out to be your fault and that you are lying.  i think its shocking. but thats 'professional' care not 'care'. i agree with hope that you should  keep pursuing your complaint - maybe you are already using pals although theyre not the best as they all seem to stick up for each other. try advocacy.  i did some voluntary work with a mental health advocacy agency and they should be on your side and at least demand answers from the managers.<br>   i'll tell you what i found in my situation. my keyworker stopped all contact with me- it transpires the reason she gave was that i was sending inappropriate txt messages although she gave me her number and she was txting me also. it was all professional and nothing personal about her but she refused to see me then reassigned my case.  she was the closest person to me i'd ever had in the world and we got on so well.  they tried to give me a male worker and i literally screamed the building down. then i got another worker who said she would treat me as a personality disorder- which actually ment she didnt treat me as a human being. i made two complaints about her in two months but never got anywhere with them. i was assigned another worker and basically told that my support was to be greatly reduced from twice a week to once every three months. I looked on all this negatively and my mental health was horrific for awhile. then i decided to re-evaluate my situation.  Maybe you could try and do this.  I do feel that I am emotionally dependant on services and specific people and this just ends up with you getting hurt in the long run.  So I’m  trying to have a different relationship with this worker and use her to get things put in place for me to help myself such as dbt and courses etc rather than investing all my emotional energy telling her how i feel and what I have been through.  I am trying to look more positively and at what other things I could be doing with my life like going back to college. this has given me some sense of hope and strength and independence.  And when they turn round maybe quite soon and say we are discharging you completely from services it wont cause me the pain I felt when I lost my worker.  I guess its self-protection and self-preservation. Maybe you could think about this – and if it looks like youre doing things to help yourself they’ll be less likely or able to apply the bpd = too dependant label- and it will be better for you in the long run even if it feels like a lonely mountain to climb. I still cry every day because I miss my worker and it hurts so much. But theres no going back. Only forward. and in your situation I think it would be extremely unlikely that they will let you work together with this person again as she obviously has an issue with you or your label.  Try and grow strong from this experience.  But still follow through with your complaint as you are in the right and haven’t done anything wrong-and they need to acknowledge that.<br>  I hope some of this helps. Hang in there. All my best wishes and hugs x|`|P6fVoXb1aa	I honestly think its terrible that the department your with have done this, and i do not see the reason for them doing so. <br>  You have two choices, trust them and forget about your old key worker, or make them feel extremely guilty. <br>  If i was in your situation id go with the guilt. <br>  Refuse to talk to any of them, cry, tell them how much you miss your old Key worker - because she was the only one you could trust. <br>  Maybe they will get her back, who knows. <br>  I can't imagine how your feeling, im depressed also. <br>  But if you ever need to talk to someone im always here. Good luck.|`|T64zP6fgaa	They sound screwed up, really.   they obviously have prejudiced you in that group, and I would not want to see someone there, anyway...<br>  I have seen this happen to people .... someone says something about them, they believe them, make it into something it is not, and pretty soon everyone believes there is something wrong with you,, etc...<br>  It really hurts, and there isnt a lot you can do about it the way the law is right now, maybe you could vent where it might do some good, or even file a formal complaint to their professional licensing agencies, eg psychology, social work, or whom ever funds the place... etc...<br>  You arent a criminal,   and I think you should keep trying to find people you can trust, who communicate better, and who dont throw you into some impossible category, like you are a hopeless case, etc...<br>  That is ridiculous...<br>  If you dont need a counselor, then dont see them, and find one in a church or something else....  If you have to see them, or a counselor, then maybe you could see someone in a near by town, or get some help on line...<br>  Do you know what they diagnose you as?  It sounds like you have been dianosed as something they dont think they can help....<br>  They sound incompetent...<br>  I am giving you a resource you might like below, and it is free, i use it and it helps a lot...<br>  Take care,  people like this hurt a lot of people, and there needs to be laws to stop it|`|tVF9O1Olaa	I am so sorry what happened to you, you need to keep up with your complaint. As some things do not make sense, what did your old key worker say about the drawings etc. This should be stated when they are accusing you of being a liar as at the moment there is no proof.<br>  As you are feeling your voice isn't being heard and this may be due to your disorder (BPD) you need to look into advocacy. This is where someone will speak to them on your behalf and make your opinions and voice be heard. You can get paid ones or volunteers i think 'rethink' do advocacy for mental health or look or the 'mind' website. Good luck|`|AA11280073	You need more help than anyone on a chat board can give you. Talk to your psychiatrist. You have an obsession.
uC75y83Taa	No. A part-time nurse is not common.  If you want one, and find one, grab it!  As long as you're a licensed RN, that should be all you need for part-time.<br>  Good luck!  :)|`|7pxJdyRcaa	If you mean do RN's work part time rather than full time, yes they do generally by choice.  It is not  a matter of experience as an RN has to complete the studies as dictated by the college she attended and then pass the State Nursing Exam.  That does not depend on her experience before she becomes an RN.
gKrx66pnaa	They have an activation fee and various programs depending on what  your personal goals are...I started today for a little over $200 but I also did a jump start program (personal trainer which is voluntary) If you have the time ask for a trial membership which lasts about a month and talk to some of the other members. As far as student discounts I am not sure.
RP2QQXbjaa	I wouldn't trust going anywhere that says they will do blood work for you without being associated with a doctor.  <br>  <br>  The stress you have from the loss of your job (as well as other factors in your life) could be causing hormonal changes in your body, which could lead to an abnormal cycle and/or weight loss.  Stress produces hormones such as coritsol, which helps you in times of stress but can also be bad for your body.  Try to do some relaxation activites that will lower your stress.  Also, you should probably speak with your doctor (I realize that's hard sometimes without insurance) as soon as you can.|`|TCVKpfeJaa	I've had two periods before.  I wouldn't worry too much.  A lot of it is probably your eating habits.<br>  <br>  As far as going to get blood work done, it is basically going to cost money.  But if you got laid off, you might have government assistance available in your area or you can check around to see if there are reduced price medical clinics in your city.

You will then be injected with a local anaesthetic into an area of skin covering the space between your lower vertebrae. <br>  <br>  The Doctor will then insert a needle  between the two vertebra into the area around the spinal cord which is filled with CSF. You shouldn't feel any pain as the area is numb, the only thing you may feel is a bit of pressure as the needle is inserted. Fluid is then collected and sent away for analysis. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

UWTkdG6uaa	they're all going to give you the same weight (give or take a few pounds)<br>  but i would definitely suggest digital ones as they are more accurate and i LOVE weight watchers scales as they tell you you're body fat body water and bmi and some can even record your start weight, goal weight and progression. <br>  i know there are other scales that probably do the same but i've got weight watchers ones which is why i mention it, they're quite pricey though - mine were ￡49 from argos|`|cku5S9WLaa	Any, it really doesn't matter. I saw a really cheap one at Argos which is about ￡3.89|`|Rk46lIBwaa	It doesn't matter as long as you spend enough to get a decent set.|`|OuOOy8v3aa	It doesn't really matter.<br>  Digital ones are better though, because it is easier to tell your weight.
b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	Well, if you want to conceive tell the dr and he will prescribe something other than the "pill".  I was diagnosed with PCOS and my endocrinologist prescribed metformin.  I take 500 mg 3 times a day.  I have had one healthy daughter and two miscarriages.  So although metformin is a "diabetic drug" it helps with the insulin resistance most women with PCOS have.  Do try to avoid any processed, greasy sugary foods and exercise whenever you can, this will help you tremendously.|`|I8lFqyyFaa	You've only been trying 2 months.  Clomid runs the risk of a multiple birth, which increases the risk of loss and problems to all fetuses.  Additionally there are smaller risks like hyperstimulation of your ovaries.  I'd try the metformin first to see if that helps you ovulate normally, and try for a longer period of time before I moved up to clomid.  Twins sounds cute and all, but the risk of multiples to the health of the babies, and the complexity this adds to your pregnancy should not be played down at all.|`|H3giw4QHaa	Metformin is a diabetic drug|`|sGP6s7uraa	If you're over weight, loosing just 10 pounds can increase your chances for conception.  My cousin (we're really, really close) has PCOS and she was on bc for about 6 months.  They put you on the pill so that your periods can become regulare.  Once your period is regular, the better chance that you will ovulate when you get OFF the pill.  She is pregnant now and is due June 15th with a baby girl.  Just practice patience, ok?  You and your husband will get there. <br>  <br>  BTW - He did NOT have to be tested for anything.
2VO4dc30aa	you tested to soon didnt you read the instructions? <br>  if you get first response it can only give you an accurate <br>  reading about 3 days before your period and then it tells<br>  you if its negative to wait 3 days and take another one<br>  thats why they come in packs of 2s and 3s.

LPO8RlVdaa	Okay, it just sounds like you need some basic information more than anything. The good news is you are half way there so keep it up, just add these tips into your new healthy lifestyle.<br>  <br>  For a healthy diet, you need to be eating small to medium meals regularly. 4 or even 5 times a day. Each meal (apart from breakfast which should preferably be fibre rich), should contain a balanced ammount of carbohydrates for energy, (from potatoes, rice and pasta, etc) protien (from fish, chicken, occassional red meat is fine, soya is good too) and plenty of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants (simple fresh fruit and veg). Eat like this and make sure you are well hydrated (fruit juice is as good as water, any fluid counts, but some fluids have negative effects too, such as alcohol or caffiene rich drinks.)<br>  <br>  Now for the science bit: Protien is essential for repairing muscle and keeping the muscle you do have healthy (this includes your heart, lungs, brain etc). You naturally lose the ammount of protien you have throughout the day (through urine etc) so this needs to be replenished regularly on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  Carbohydrates are essential for energy. You won't be able to function without it. It also regulates body fat and glucose etc.<br>  <br>  Vitamins and minerals are obviously essential for a variety of reasons. For normal growth and development, for the healthy maintenance of the cells, tissues, and organs that make up our bodies, and also to let us efficiently use chemical energy provided by food.<br>  <br>  You can have a wide range of healthy meals with this, from Thai, Chinese, Italian, British, Indian, etc. Just make sure each meal contains balanced ammounts of these three. On the bright side too, fresh veg and rice and pasta is a lot cheaper than crappy junk food!<br>  <br>  This doesn't mean you cant have chocolate or pizza/takeaway/etc, just save them as very occassional treats.<br>  <br>  The big secret to keeping a healthy weight and staying healthy is EXCERCISE, particularly cardio excercise. <br>  <br>  Cardio exercise includes any form of excercise such as running/jogging/swimming/cycling etc that gets your heart rate pumping and you sweating and out of breath. It will not only burn calories and reduce your body fat levels, therefore making you 'slimmer' by having less fat on you, but will also improve your resting heart rate and lung function, making you healthier. <br>  <br>  I cannot understate the importance of cardio excercise. It is this which will basically burn the body fat off you. <br>  <br>  But you have to remember that once you have shed a bit of fat you have to have a nice toned body underneath the fat to show off. <br>  <br>  Strength training will help you strengthen and tone your muscles. This is done with the use of weights or by free training.<br>  <br>  There are essentially (without getting overly complicated) two types of strength excercises based on different types of muscle fibres depending on wether you want to build size, bulk and power, or just 'tone' up the lean muscles an get more muscle endurance.<br>  <br>  Heavy weights with short reps/sets will build your fast twitch muscle fibres and build size, power and strength. Imagine big guys at the gym lifting heavy weights. <br>  <br>  But if you use light to medium weights with lots of reps/sets you will excercise your slow twitch muscle fibres, you wont build size, but you will tone up your body and train muscle endurance. This will obviously make you 'look' healthier and more toned, but will also increase your metabolism (as your muscles demand more energy) so you will burn calories faster. These muscles are also excercised a lot with cardio workouts (i.e your leg muscles when running).<br>  <br>  Your arms for example, will need bicep curls and tricep dips using weights and reps of your choice (heavy - low reps, light - lots of reps) and also shoulder excercises such as holding the weights at your waist and lifting them perpendicular to your side or in front of you, etc etc.<br>  <br>  Your stomach will need excercises that cover the entire torso. Leg raises for your lower ab wall, crunches, sit ups and planks for your upper and all over ab wall, oblique twists for your sides and superman stretches for your lower back for example.<br>  <br>  These are just basic examples, there are literally hundreds of excercises, but it is impossible to show you on a site like this, get a trainer at your gym to show you some but remember the basic rules of muscles and weights. <br>  <br>  As far as excercise goes, you should aim to strike a balance between cardio training and strength training, this way you will build good strong and toned muscle, but also keep your body fat levels down and increase your heart and lung performance, making you much fitter and healthier.|`|piQw9Ffuaa	man try this proteins <a href="http://all4nothing.info/Health/?p=75" rel="nofollow">http://all4nothing.info/Health/?p=75</a><br>  and heres some ebooks how to work out<br>  <a href="http://all4nothing.info/Health/?page_id=149" rel="nofollow">http://all4nothing.info/Health/?page_id=...</a>

sKTmxnx1aa	Yes!  Definitely press charges against him!  Don't let him get away with doing something that horrible!  And honey, if you want to keep the baby, than you keep it!  No one has the right to force you to get an abortion if you don't want it!  Talk to your parents.  Tell them that there are people who get abortions and never recover from the guilt of what they have done.  Tell them that you know you can take care of the baby well, and if they don't listen, stay with your sister.  Hope this helps, and good luck!|`|ildgJVJoaa	It honestly doesn't sound like you were raped - why would your parents say this was your fault, and why would you want to keep the baby when you didn't willingly have sex with the father? I don't know what a "rape kit" is, but if you are keeping the baby, do not press charges, because you will most likely lose. If you are not keeping the baby, you can press charges, and he will most likely have to pay for the abortion.|`|YHvKLeilaa	First of all I'm sorry for what you have been through,your parents are just trying to help you,have you thought about once the baby gets here will you hold against it the fact that its father raped you? Their  trying to look out for you, 16 is very young to be pregnant, I know I was there myself, And hell yes you should press charges no matter who's bf he is. Again I'm sorry your going through this. Good luck.|`|dN1d8cuNaa	( I'm a male ) Well, I would press charges and make him pay half the baby fund. So I think, it would be fair to press charges and ask him to pay for a house and half the baby fee's. Put in the meantime live with you're sister.|`|4gC38fKsaa	it depends how long ago the rape was. there is a statute of limitations that limits how long you have to press charges. but if you still have the baby right now, you can definately press charges, and you should. don't let another guy get away with rape.<br>  <br>  also, your family is nasty and despicable. For one, when they said, "Though it is your fault." they are saying that they don't belive you that it was rape. which is not ok. and your little sister should get over herself and stop being a sefish little bitc*. <br>  <br>  if you want the baby, i would reccommend asking your sister if you can live with her till the baby is born, so you can be out of your parent's judgemental environment. <br>  <br>  press charges against that bastard!|`|oiB4KATuaa	Have the baby if you want the baby, you know what is right in your heart. If your sister is willing to look after you then I suggest you do that. I know it was conceived under a horrible circumstance, but the positive side to being a young mother is that when your child is olde enough to be in school etc you will still be young enough to use that time to study etc so your life wont be ruined or wasted, and yes definitely press charges, because next time it will be someone else and you owe it to yourself and to the next person to tell this guy that this is not acceptable!! Good luck:)|`|KLlz9gehaa	Yes, press charges.  Even though you have decided you want to keep the baby, it still is not right what he has done. Until he is stopped, he will continue to do it to more and more girls.  Have you told you bff?  I would let her know first before she finds out from the police.

Make sure they are good calories and not junk food. So lean protein and good fats.
Up1MrXI3aa	the majority of cancer is caused by an overload of toxins in the body causing your healthy cells to go crazy. cigarettes obviously have a lot of toxins in them and therefor have many cancer causing agents. your question is the first time i heard oxygen listed as an ingredient of cigarettes, lol, the term carcinogens literally means cancer causing agent. i think you were looking for a more detailed answer than carcinogens so essentially anything considered toxic to the body that is inside the particular cigarette would be a cancer causing agent.|`|XGsuxRR2aa	The term carcinogen refers to any substance, radionuclide or radiation that is an agent directly involved in the promotion of cancer or in the increase of its propagation. <br>  <br>  Basically everything can, since there is so much stuff in a cigarette, the nicotine may not though, but that's just the reason people smoke, the small rush... besides maybe trying to look cool.<br>  <br>  So carcinogens.|`|ou2vZnkqaa	carbon monoxide, tar, arsenic, lead, nicotine.  nicotine is the one that leads to addiction.  i read somewhere before that arsenic causes cancer and it causes damage to your heart.|`|ML3PGUPYaa	what is not* a cancer causing agent in cigarettes|`|QI6rR2bTaa	None.

In addition, many of these substances, such as carbon monoxide, tar, arsenic, and lead, are poisonous and toxic to the human body. Nicotine is a drug that is naturally present in the tobacco plant and is primarily responsible for a person’s addiction to tobacco products, including cigarettes. During smoking, nicotine is absorbed quickly into the bloodstream and travels to the brain in a matter of seconds. Nicotine causes addiction to cigarettes and other tobacco products that is similar to the addiction produced by using heroin and cocaine (9).|`|16HN5H3Maa	I think it's nicotine?

When you have to urinate, you relax your inner core muscles and allow the urine to pass.  If the muscles constrict again while peeing, the flow stops.  This may be voluntary or involuntary.  It might be because you have been holding your pee too long before you finally go.  The internal muscles may be 'spasming' tight/loose from the sudden release of tension they have been under.  Try this.  As soon as you feel you have to pee, go right away.  Do not hold off. (find an appropriate place of course)  See if it happens when you do this.  Then try holding it for as long as you comfortably can, and see if it happens more then.  It may take some experimentation.|`|EtbPhdhLaa	i don't know dude. i do the same thing and wonder if it is normal or not. i guess its okay. doesn't hurt or anything.
a7364c50b7e6712ee3c77218a3232b45aa	It can take a few years for things to settle down - remember you are still growing and undergoing a lot of hormonal changes at 15!  Some people seem to be lucky and not have much bother with periods and others have to put up with what you experienced - but usually only now and again.  Just take Tylenol/Paracetamol when you have the bad cramps and go to bed with a hot-water bottle if really bad!|`|xWYKqcDjaa	I went through that a few months ago. When I got my job, I worked with all girls. Now our periods sycronize with each other, we all get them the exact same day. That caused me and my friend Jamie to just about skip a month. It was bad :(<br>  You can either blaim it on a bad diet, losing weight or gaining weight, stress, or hanging around with lots of girls! (which i didnt know could change your period, but it does!)<br>  I think it was just sore because it kinda had time to... 'build up'.<br>  As long as your not sexually active, its probably nothing to worry about.

Tk4C0kh8aa	You need to go get that checked out. You may have a disease called Tinnitus. Tinnitus can be perceived in one or both ears or in the head. It is usually described as a ringing noise, but in some patients it takes the form of a high pitched whining, buzzing, hissing, humming, or whistling sound, or as ticking, clicking, roaring, "crickets" or "tree frogs" or "locusts", tunes, songs, or beeping. It has also been described as a "whooshing" sound, as of wind or waves. Tinnitus can be intermittent or it can be continuous.

PPwsaeUxaa	Willpower, common sense, statistics. <br>  <br>  1. You have to have to have to have to have the stones to just get in the elevator. I would try to force myself to ride an elevator without getting out. Just take it up and down. Up and down. After a while you will probably just start to realize that nothing life-threatening is going on. I'm deathly afraid of deep water, but I can swim in a pool with a deep end and even in the ocean. Why? Willpower. If I really wanted to get over the fear I would probably go scuba diving. Fortunately, it's expensive and it's not a terribly crippling fear.<br>  <br>  2. How many elevators are there in the world and how many people take them up and then back down again every day? How many of them fall crashing to their death? You put yourself in more danger just getting into a car and turning the engine on.<br>  <br>  3. Educate yourself about the statistics of elevators. I'm sure you could find some on the internet if you searched for it. I'm also sure you will find that they support the good chances of surviving a ride in an elevator. However, it does have the chance to have the opposite effect if you don't read the statistics correctly. I've already done a quick search and can see how if you read it wrong you could just end up strengthening your fears.<br>  <br>  But consider this statistic:<br>  <br>  """There are about 63,000 pieces of elevating equipment in the world's tallest city - that's lifts, escalators, dumb-waiters and amusement rides - more than in Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and Dallas combined. Altogether, New York's lifts make around 30 million journeys every day. And during those billions of trips, last year there were just 139 "serious" accidents, which either required a passenger to see a doctor or caused more than $100 of damage to the lift and its passengers' property."""<br>  <br>  But there are a lot of stories that might discourage you; they might encourage you to be careful though.

For some reason the muscle in the area is damaged, either due to an unknown injury or an overstretched/overcontracted muscle.

AA10299265	I've found that the best way to burn off the extra pounds is less about workouts and more about diet. I walk briskly for at least an hour a day to just to keep my metabolism up. More importantly, though, I eat a very healthy, low refined carb diet rich in natural nutrients from a wide variety of raw natural foods.

If you don't eat breakfast you can end up feeling ravenous all day and end up eating anything and everything throughout the day to satisfy your hunger. Not a good idea! If you're not used to eating breakfast this may not be easy for you to do. The thing is to just do it. It all depends on how motivated you are. A solid, healthy breakfast will actually help you keep your diet on the right path. Something like muesli, oats or even a banana and low-fat yoghurt will be more than adequate.<br>  <br>  The next thing to ensure is that the calories you eat are from healthy foods. Eat plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables,whole grains, lean meats, poultry and fat-free selections of dairy foods. Also cut down or omit salt and sugar. Salt helps to maintain fluid retention.<br>  <br>  Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Experts recommend drinking about 5-8 tublers of water a day. Water is essential to maintaining a healthy body. It is essential for all your cells and will also help to flush out the toxins from your body. Don't be surprised if you are paying more visits to the bathroom - this is good!<br>  <br>  Eat smaller portions at regular intervals during the day. Instead of 3 meals a day, eat smaller amound 5-6 times a day. Have your breakfast, luch and dinner and also have 2-3 snacks. A snack can be as little as an apple or other piece of fruit, or a handful of nuts or dried fruits.<br>  <br>  The other essential aspect of your weight loss plan is to exercise. you don't have to join the gym or go jogging every day. Get more active throughout the day.|`|kklh2A8baa	book in to my local hospital (wirral), i caught a bug while in there and lost a stone in 20 days but i would not recommend it|`|HXILtO0Gaa	EXERCISE MORE<br>  EAT LESS<br>  DONT SNACK<br>  DRINK GREEN TEA.|`|piQw9Ffuaa	<a href="http://all4nothing.info/Health/?cat=10" rel="nofollow">http://all4nothing.info/Health/?cat=10</a><br>  check here some loss weight products|`|Rk46lIBwaa	You are going to fail FAST, unless you develop a sensible attitude to weight loss.

The answer is of course always the same!|`|249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?

09Y8F6hQaa	Yes it is as beneficial.  There is the thought that you have to keep your heart rate elevated for at least 20 minutes, but think of this logically?  Kids, who are active, are healthy, and they aren't running around for 20 minutes straight.  They are racing, stopping, sitting, jumping, etc.  Its really a mix of athletics, don't you think?  Take a hint from kids, do it all and keep it interesting.  Any class that I've taken at the gym, that I really like, involved a mix of activities.  Cardio, weights, etc.  Try it?

SpnUwHVGaa	Any pro hormone like Methyl 1-D is a testosterone booster and Methyl is rather strong. I have personally taken Methyl as well as others like it. I will say this...I would not recommend it to you mainly because of your age at 16 you are still developing and messing with your testosterone levels would not be smart. I took it when I was 24. I did Notice strength and size gains but when I came off the cycle I had side effects like depression and extreme lack of energy. I know messing with your test levels doesn't seem like a big deal at your age but it catches up to you later on. While on the supplement I also was experiencing it messing with my sex life when I started my sex drive went up, but when I got a couple weeks into it I had absolutely none and had problems getting it up. I did keep some of the weight, but I stopped taking it because in the end it wasn't worth it, I am still an avid body builder but have since stopped using testosterone boosters because I was tired of all the ups and downs when I was on it and off....I still stick by what I am doing now and thats staying away from all the pro hormone supplements out there and only taking protein and standard other products, as well as eating *** loads of fish, chicken etc. Get what you can from your food.

GOOD LUCK ! hope this helps|`|ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|LywVUxsTaa	Here is a really good, really busy, web forum with all kinds of support, info and tips on losing weight and being healthy:  <a href="http://www.3fatchicks.com/forum/" rel="nofollow">http://www.3fatchicks.com/forum/</a>|`|MWEPNhqkaa	Easy! the answer is sport, and careful eating.

AA11088528	Could be any of a number of reasons,but likely 1 of the 2....you either have injured deep tissue at one time or another and it causes pain when held in unnatural positions because it is weak now, OR and this is the most likely answer...Even though you are 24, you have arthritis in your knee. Age means nothing when it comes to Arthritis. I was diagnosed with Severe OsteoArthritis when I was 15 years old. The knees and hips are commonly the first places that you will notice Arthritis,and from the circumstances that you describe your pain to show up under it sounds like Arthritis to me.<br>  For instance if you have your legs propped up on an ottoman or the coffeetable for a while and then go to bend to put them down, it hurts like "you know what" thats arthritis!!

HpJ4wwC7aa	Yes, inflammation from ulcerative colitis damages the colon and increases the likelihood of cancer. It also makes more puss and bleeding. So you take Remicade and you still have constant flare ups? I have UC, and was on Asacol and on and off prednisone and I wasn't able to get my flare ups under control until I started the Remicade. Now that I'm on the Remicade (I've been on it almost two years) I haven't had any serious flare ups. You should see your specialist to see what else can be done because constant inflammation in the body is bad for any type of cancer. Have you tried altering your diet and stuff? Sometimes slight food alergies can trigger a flare up. I'm really sorry that your treatment isn't working for you. I know how frustrating and debilitating this disease can be.

Check close to the scalp and make sure you see either live eggs or lice before you treat yourself.<br>  <br>  Before you listen to anyone advising you to use a chemical treatment (over the counter shampoo) please consider the following:<br>  <br>  No chemical head lice treatment is legally allowed to be labeled as 'safe' as every insecticide is a poison. Every pesticide preparation has the potential to do serious damage depending on the individual. If a lice treatment does not work once it is not going to work twice, in fact the lice that live will breed into a whole new batch that are resistant to that chemical.<br>  <br>  Read these articles and try to find a natural remedy containing Neem oil as this renders the lice unable to breed therefore making it impossible for them to build up a resistance.<br>  <br>  Feel free to check out the articles at the following sites for more advice.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11631715	explore the hair behind your ears very carefully, looking for actual lice or white eggs glued to the hair shafts.

UmX58lC0aa	HAHAHHHA FATTY!!!!|`|wGTisY1aaa	My workout routine<br>  <br>  I do a push pull workout on most days. 3 days a week i do strength training and the other 3 I do  65 minutes cardio moderate speed (3.5- 3.7) on an incline of 10-13. I take Sundays off to rest and relax. Push pull for example is doing triceps extension with or without a break then doing biceps curls and adding reverse or regular crunches in there to make sure I get abs in and it cuts down on time. I do abs a lot to keep my core strong. I try to get all of the muscles in that area to work together on the same day. Do the amount of weight for what you want to accomplish. Say for toning, lightweight and high reps (15-20) and 3-4 sets. To build muscle, 2-3 sets and 10-12 reps. All beginners need to start with 1-2 sets and 8-10 reps with lightweights.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL.

So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info.

2RzEaod9aa	1. Based on how much junk was in there (preservatives versus real ingredients), I can't tell you how much damage you've done. Honestly, you just need to move past it and not dwell on it. You don't have a time machine, so there's no point in thinking about the past. What's done is done. Learn and move on.<br>  <br>  2. The mindset you need to be in is this: "Life sucks, so I don't want to add to that." You're already dealing with stressful sh*t on a daily basis, so why add to that misery by punishing your body and emotional state? You need to stay strong because you'll otherwise just make yourself more miserable...and really, who wants that?<br>  <br>  3.

I should've.. Maybe If I)<br>  D- epression (.....)<br>  A - acceptance (alright, I lost my .... I accept defeat)<br>  <br>  People have different ways of reaching the second A (acceptance). It is by preference, by culture, or subconsciously..<br>  <br>  Anyway, my advise to you, is that try to get through the Denial Phase.. This is usually the hardest part. Try to think thoroughly about your problems. And try to see the reality if you are able to.. This is the part where you distinguish what you would have wanted, and what is there now..<br>  <br>  Once you've started facing the facts of your problems (even just a bit), try talking to a trusted friend, or family or bf/gf.. It helps if you are able to verbalize what concerns you THE MOST with regards to your current problem<br>  <br>  Most people that insulates (does other things so they'd forget they have a problem), supress (intentionally forget a problem like by not mentioning it), or other unhealthful defense mechanisms, it usually takes them a longer time to reach the Acceptance phase..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  talk, talk, and talk to the people you trust... It helps...

F5op0aWLaa	Excellent question, I had always thought it was caused by lactic acid build-up, but upon reading up on your question, I just learned that that is a misconception. The cause of Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness, or DOMS, is still unknown, but Shayla already said the popular belief of today.|`|pOaS9P38aa	A muscle is able to perform work by using nutrients introduced by the bloodstream, a key element of which is an oxygen rich environment. <br>  <br>  In a heavily worked muscle, glucose is being acted upon by pyruvic acid to release energy, oxygen is being pumped in to allow this to take place, the bloodstream removing waste products, the main one being lactic acid. <br>  <br>  Problems start when the oxygen supply is reduced, usually during the compacted part of the muscle cycle, (a muscle has an oxygen reserve of about six seconds). Then, in the oxygen depleted environment, the pyruvic acid turns into lactic acid, which no longer can be removed due to the restricted blood flow. The muscle starts to ache, which is a low-level pain, and is the body's early warning system. <br>  <br>  This is a simplified explanation, the reality is a lot more complex involving a chain of organic chemical processes known as the 'Kreb Cycle'. The disruption of which by the anaerobic state causes waste products such as carbon dioxide and negative hydrogen ions being produced in the muscle and lymph system. The resulting acidity further irritates nerve endings causing more muscular pain.<br>  <br>  If the muscle is not allowed to recover there is a further build up of lactic acid, resulting in extreme pain in the form of cramp. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hopefully, rest and recuperation will allow the problem to be solved.|`|CmPvZ6Ucaa	its called lactic acid, when our cells respire (make energy out of sugars and oxygen) it gives our body the energy and what it needs to function but when we exercise, we cant always give enough oxygen to our body ( causings to breath more heavily) and when the cells don't have oxygen to make energy, one of the products it does make is lactic acid which causes our muscles to ache and feel sore/tired <br>  <br>  once you exercise more and the activity becomes easier, your body will be able to use more oxygen, and stretching helps too!|`|G7k9HTQNaa	it is just because you don't do it very often. our muscles aren't used to it, so they get sore while they are building muscles. do make it not hurt as much after a while, stretch in the beginning, and more importantly, AFTER to help get those muscles|`|67JXdC7Gaa	your tearing your muscle which in turn breaks them down and rebuilds them making them stronger and usely lactic acid buildup in muscle tissue!|`|Y9Sj56D5aa	your just using muscles more then you use to it's normal|`|LzPhdri5aa	There is a build up in muscle tissue on exertion called Lactic Acid.  It is a natural part of the body's process, but when you exert the muscle beyond its normal function, the lactic acid builds up causing the burning sensation.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	A common belief is that it's related to the release of lactic acid, I would add that muscles which were not used would ache, after exercise, until homeostasis is achieved and the pain recedes.|`|H2bFiDNAaa	lactic acid<br>  <br>  When we exercise, we use lactic acid fermentation to produce the energy needed. As a result, lactic acid is also formed. To get rid of lactic acid, we pay an "oxygen debt". In other words, our body uses oxygen to get rid of it; that's why we breathe heavily when exercising so it's important to pace yourself and take long, deep breaths.|`|zWo03iLNaa	Our muscles ache because when you use them a lot the muscle breaks apart and then builds back together and creates a bigger mass. This is why muscles get bigger and why it hurts when they do so.|`|G2LJ0Zhyaa	Its blood veins boring through your muscles like worms, to take blood to places in the muscles where it wasn't needed before.  So the muscles can operate more effectively.|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	Your muscles secreate waste when you use them pretty intensly. That soreness is the byproduct.

If you're not in the habit of intentionally cracking your joints, it might just mean your joints are naturally a bit loose, nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  And as far as "making your bones weak"?

10r8cXezaa	Autism - Symptoms<br>  Core symptoms<br>  The severity of symptoms varies greatly between individuals, but all people with autism have some core symptoms in the areas of:<br>  <br>  Social interactions and relationships. Symptoms may include: <br>  Significant problems developing nonverbal communication skills, such as eye-to-eye gazing, facial expressions, and body posture.<br>  Failure to establish friendships with children the same age. <br>  Lack of interest in sharing enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people.<br>  Lack of empathy. People with autism may have difficulty understanding another person's feelings, such as pain or sorrow.<br>  Verbal and nonverbal communication. Symptoms may include: <br>  Delay in, or lack of, learning to talk. As many as 40% of people with autism never speak.1<br>  Problems taking steps to start a conversation. Also, people with autism have difficulties continuing a conversation after it has begun.<br>  Stereotyped and repetitive use of language. People with autism often repeat over and over a phrase they have heard previously (echolalia).<br>  Difficulty understanding their listener's perspective. For example, a person with autism may not understand that someone is using humor. They may interpret the communication word for word and fail to catch the implied meaning.<br>  Limited interests in activities or play. Symptoms may include: <br>  An unusual focus on pieces. Younger children with autism often focus on parts of toys, such as the wheels on a car, rather than playing with the entire toy. <br>  Preoccupation with certain topics. For example, older children and adults may be fascinated by video games, trading cards, or license plates.<br>  A need for sameness and routines. For example, a child with autism may always need to eat bread before salad and insist on driving the same route every day to school.<br>  Stereotyped behaviors. These may include body rocking and hand flapping.|`|8ryoShBpaa	I also want to add that my children no longer have autism after treating them for pathogens and toxins.|`|OleVPkJgaa	Symptoms typically appear before a child is 3 years old and last throughout life.

reAtqf0Maa	remeber you can only burn what you eat. less then one thousand isn't very healthy . you should do this while exercising and dieting but getting all ur calories<br>  <br>  <br>  well you could start out simple first. like for the first few days cut back a bit. maybe don't have that dressing on the salad. or have water instead of soda. stuff like that. start simple. then slowly go to the diet part. where you have a apple instead of a brownie. or yogurt instead ofice creamm. then start exercising and dieting. this is a slow process but much simpler because you can adjust easier.<br>  <br>  <br>  now for fast weight lose )like what your doing to keep motivated) do this. take ten exercises you can do at home and crank you favorite tunes while doing this. like this<br>  <br>  1.sit ups<br>  2. jumping jacks<br>  3. squat thrusts (squats but push your arms out when you squat then pull them back in, basically getting arms in volved in squats<br>  4. crunches<br>  5.push ups( on your knees if you have to but fininsh the set)<br>  6. on your hands and knees and kick a leg back (for the but)<br>  7.elbow to knee crunches ( for obliques)<br>  8.side leg lifts<br>  9. stand up and kick a leg forward while puching arms out forward<br>  10.get on back with legs in air then bring on leg to the stomack to the other.<br>  <br>  do eack of there for one minute and DON'T take breaks in between them. the only break you should take is switching from each e xercise. it should only take a few seconds to switch though. do these for as long as you can. after you do all ten have some water and start up again. i recomend this you do this 3-6 times a day which will give you a 30 - 60 min workout. do it longer if you can! <br>  <br>  <br>  whenever you feel like eating some junk food you have to get your mind off it. play a computer game. watch tv. read a book. exercise. if the craving is so bad then have something healtthy and you will feel great after knowign you stayed strong! this will keep you motivated.<br>  <br>  know you need to learn to love dieting. for instance, strawberries are very healthy for you. if you love them then keep them in the house more so you can have more yummy healthy food to eat from when you are hungry. <br>  <br>  know besides diet and exercise i recomend you drink green tea. it helps me lose weight while i am dieting and exercising! also eat celery. it is has lots of vitamin and minerals and it will keep you full! also it has water in it so it makes it a great diet food!<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  :)|`|tw3Uzn1Caa	I'm not sure of your reasoning but it definetely isnt good to eat less than 1,000 calories that just shuts down your metabolism and slows down burning fat butttt you could possibly lose that much from loss of water weight but it will go right back on after you stop doing that!

Im not sure if you workout or excercise but you should consider doing cardio for 30-60 min 3 times a week and weight lifting that helps burn calories and raise your metabolism.  Im not sure exactly what a soyjoy snack is but for breakfast it is always good to start the day off with fiber! not only is it good for you but it helps you feel fuller longer so anytime you can eat more fiber do so.  and 3500 calories equals one pound so you want to have a deficit of 3500 calories a week if you want to lose one pound a week and 7000 for 2 pounds and so on. That is why not only eating well is important but excercising as well! drink LOTS of water and stay away from fast food and it will help also

yWRZDGfcaa	Don't worry about your likes and dislikes as far as colors and nonsexual activities go, that stuff generally doesn't have much to do with sexuality.  Also, don't hate yourself!  That isn't going to make the feelings go away, it will probably just cause you more weird confused feelings.  Also, that's just not good for anybody!<br>  <br>  Weird thoughts and puberty: I remember when I was around puberty age being afraid that my dad and grandpa would be attracted to me.  I've never been sexually abused (which is the conclusion people would jump to if i had told them that) by anyone, and they never acted like pervs around me.  The feelings went away after a year or so, and I can honestly say I do believe they were caused by strange raging hormones.<br>  <br>  Most trans people say they've felt the wrong sex since they were very young children, so if these feelings are new you might just be a confused "normal" adolescent :P<br>  <br>  If the thoughts don't go away it's okay to be a little scared, but I hope you won't try to change who you are.   Remember that 1/10 people are gay!  So even if you aren't sure what's going on yet, remember that a few of your other classmates are going through something somewhat similar.  They're just not talking about it because they are scared like you.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with being gay.  Don't ever let a parent, religion/faith, or classmate tell you that.  Almost all psychologists that thought it was a disorder died a long time ago.<br>  <br>  To me it doesn't sound like you are trans or gay, but that isn't up to me.  Especially since I am not a psychologist, or even gay or trans for that matter.  I do however love to study and understand psychology, felt like an alien as a teenager, and have always asked my gay/trans friends lots of questions.  I hope you feel that makes me qualified enough for you to take my advice  :D<br>  <br>  Whether you end up gay, bi, trans, or straight, go easy on yourself!  And cut it out with the worrying :P  that never changed anyone's anything.   Puberty and the teenage years can REALLY SUCK sometimes and you should try to make them as easy as you can.  But there's really exciting times too, and I promise life is much easier after this stage.<br>  <br>  There is so much more I want to reassure you with, but I'm afraid if I don't shut up now you won't read any of it since it's starting to look like an essay.<br>  <br>  I hope everything works out as easily as possible for you <3|`|NKmmqjWFaa	if you don't want to be "trans" you don't have to be. It is okay for a girl to like guy things it doesn't mean you are a guy. It probably just means your interests are changing. You may be kinda a tomboy, or if you know these thoughts bother you sometimes it makes you think them even more because that's just how our mind sometimes works. You are not  a lesbian because you say you like when guys look at ur butt so, just relax and take a deep breath. you are perfectly normal. i promise|`|ccbf2f73aa9091e420a8c51732cd0415aa	i wouldn't worry.  we all feel a little mixed up sometimes.  if feeling like a man seems to become more prevalent maybe you could speak to a counselor confidentially but i think you're ok.   there's a little masculine and feminine in all of us...some are more equal..some are more predominantly one.
Wzws8v8daa	hey girl,  i answered one of your other questions and told you how sorry honey that i have irregular periods and found out that i have a hormonal imbalance and am not ovulatng....  well i read these other questions that you've posted and i just wanted to let you know that this is most likely NOT what's going on with you, because i see that you said you had blood work done for your thyroid before.  if you had a hormonal imbalance, they would have noticed it in that bloodwork.  <br>  if you want to know if/when you are ovulating, you should try the basal temperature thing.  do you know about that?  you take your temperature every morning first thing as soon as you wake up and then right it down.  the day that you ovulate, your temperature will spike up (at least a 1/2 degree raise) and it will stay up for a few days.  if you keep track of this for a cycle, then at least you will be able to tell if and when you ovulated.  i tried this out and my temperature never spiked so that's how i knew i wasn't ovulating.<br>  good luck!!!!!!!!|`|9pLdhuBnaa	To find out if you have a hormone imbalance you would need to have a doctor run a series of blood tests to check for other things besides thyroid issues.<br>  <br>  Because you don't have health insurance check with the city health department to see if they offer a free health clinic that can evaluate this further for you.

e2e426c7412c57bd7f104afda806b223aa	The sensitivity is not permanent, but it won't go away if you keep consuming artificial sweeteners. You can use all the sensodyne you want, but you have to cut down on the sweets to see results.<br>  <br>  There are foods that can help increase the health of your teeth. Use a mouthrinse with fluoride in it like Plax. Eat more dairy like milk, cheese. Eat foods that make your bones stronger like bok choy and celery. It might take a week of consistent eating for these veggies to help your sensitivity go away but it's worth it. They don't work instantly.<br>  <br>  If you must eat foods with artificial sweeteners one strategy is to substitute the food with one that has real sugar in it. I use Honey Sweetened fig bars from Whole Foods Market. These taste almost as good as chocolate but are all natural.<br>  <br>  You can also brush your teeth immediately after drinking the cola or whatever sweet you are eating to help remove some of the sugar and it's deleterious effects.<br>  <br>  Cola is not the only food that makes your teeth sensitive. Chocolate is one of the worst. Also, citrus like Oranges, lemons, grapefruit, etc. red wine, anything acidic can make your teeth sensitive. Salsa is another bad one as well.|`|oojO4WAraa	Get some Sensodyne toothpaste.  It really helps.|`|6D8BI1ffaa	Did you see 20/20 a couple of weeks ago about the kids in Appalachia?  They drink Mountain Dew and have the worst teeth you've ever seen (or no teeth at all for some adults).  You don't want to end up like them, I'm sure.  Take your doctor's advice and cut back on the cola.  In the meantime, you might want to brush with Sensodyne and rinse with a little peroxide in tepid (just barely warm) water until your teeth become less sensitive.  Also, try to stay away from very hot or very cold foods.  If you must drink cold beverages, use a straw.|`|YQhYJyNaaa	Sensodyne toothpaste works great.

AA11332588	Do you have alternating bouts of constipation and diarrhea? If so,I would consider IBS.  However, I would ask for a urinalysis to rule out kidney infection.  You do not mention age but it could also be cysts on your ovaries.  Maybe you should see a Gyno.  Get the ua from him/her and have your ovaries checked.  In the meantime try Motrin or Alleve and drink lots of water.

qpmGLd7laa	Yes, you most likely do.  I've dealt with it my entire life, but the last year or so hasn't been so bad.  You should try to stay active, and force yourself not to give in to your feelings.  I know it's the most horrible feeling ever when your feet feel like they're doing something terribly wrong, but you should do your best to fight the urge to "fix" whatever problem you have.  For example, if you move your left foot a little, and you begin to do the same with your right, stop yourself!  It's going to be more difficult to give up your more time-consuming routines, and those that involve safety (like checking electrical objects), but that's why you should begin by subduing your urge to do the simpler things.<br>  <br>  What happens is that you respond to occurrences as if an error has occurred, when one really has not.  The front part of out brains are overly active, and this portion responds to error.  Everything can "feel" wrong to us, and it can be debilitating, but you can overcome OCD with enough effort. Seek counseling if you're having trouble correcting your behavior alone; the fact that someone else will hold you to your efforts will be an incentive not to give up.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wKUst6Xyaa	I would say yes. I have experienced OCD myself. It can be frustrating but you can get better. Go see a therapist who treats disorders. They xan help.|`|TraU6JFUaa	I think that you may have.

fAFXkikAaa	Actually, most people with herpes don't have any symptoms at all.  This is how 20% of the population can have herpes, yet it still be considered a disease that only "dirty" people get.   Most people who have it don't realize that the've caught it - even though they can go on to infect other people. <br>  <br>  If you are going to get a "classic" initial outbreak - not just sores, but also a fever and body aches - then it will likely come between two days and three weeks after infection.<br>  <br>  But many people go weeks, months, or years before they have their first outbreak.<br>  <br>  For more information on herpes, include how to best protect yourself if your partner has herpes and you do not, I recommend the website below.<br>  <br>  Good question.|`|AAnjMkKKaa	Following infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV), symptoms typically start within 10 days. The first sign on the skin may be an area of reddening. This is often followed by the development of blisters or ulcerations (often grouped together as ‘lesions’, which describes any irregularity of the skin). The blisters, which can look like small pimples, burst to form an ulcer and then crust over. <br>  <br>  In women, the lesions in a first episode can occur on the lips of the vagina (the vulva), urethra, cervix, upper thigh and around the anus. In men, lesions can occur on the penis, urethra, scrotum, upper thigh and around the anus. The lesions are often painful for an average of 9 days and take 2–3 weeks to heal. Some patients may experience general symptoms such as fever, muscle pain/tiredness and swollen and tender glands (lymph nodes) in the groin

5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	The problem faced in this kind of matter is simple, EDUCATION. Or rather LACK of education. The government, actually local health authorities, WANT to teach people about this subject and they would if they COULD. The roadblock is the parents, parents who think sex education is BAD, for religious or other reasons. Idiots. Ignoring a problem does not mean it goes away. These people teach abstinence, which does NOTHING to tell people about the RISKS they face, nor what symptoms to watch for. Kids will have sex no matter what parents will say or do, at least SOME will. My parents recognized this and my mom, a registered nurse, taught all of us kids very well with all the details. I learned virtually NOTHING in school because of the idiots that restricted the school from providing any information that was accurate and of any value. It really helped that I grew up in a rural farm area of Illinois and saw biological reproduction first hand from an early age. I am FOR complete, accurate sex education. I am FOR supplying birth control to teenagers if they ask for it, anonymously even. If we teach kids HOW to be responsible and WHY it is important, in my opinion they WILL be responsible.|`|tG1vTi0Daa	The government does do some things.

reAtqf0Maa	you might be eating more junk then you realise. here is what you should do <br>  <br>  well you could start out simple first. like for the first few days cut back a bit. maybe don't have that dressing on the salad. or have water instead of soda. stuff like that. start simple. then slowly go to the diet part. where you have a apple instead of a brownie. or yogurt instead ofice creamm. then start exercising and dieting. this is a slow process but much simpler because you can adjust easier.<br>  <br>  <br>  now for fast weight lose )like what your doing to keep motivated) do this. take ten exercises you can do at home and crank you favorite tunes while doing this. like this<br>  <br>  1.sit ups<br>  2. jumping jacks<br>  3. squat thrusts (squats but push your arms out when you squat then pull them back in, basically getting arms in volved in squats<br>  4. crunches<br>  5.push ups( on your knees if you have to but fininsh the set)<br>  6. on your hands and knees and kick a leg back (for the but)<br>  7.elbow to knee crunches ( for obliques)<br>  8.side leg lifts<br>  9. stand up and kick a leg forward while puching arms out forward<br>  10.get on back with legs in air then bring on leg to the stomack to the other.<br>  <br>  do eack of there for one minute and DON'T take breaks in between them. the only break you should take is switching from each e xercise. it should only take a few seconds to switch though. do these for as long as you can. after you do all ten have some water and start up again. i recomend this you do this 3-6 times a day which will give you a 30 - 60 min workout. do it longer if you can! <br>  <br>  <br>  whenever you feel like eating some junk food you have to get your mind off it. play a computer game. watch tv. read a book. exercise. if the craving is so bad then have something healtthy and you will feel great after knowign you stayed strong! this will keep you motivated.<br>  <br>  know you need to learn to love dieting. for instance, strawberries are very healthy for you. if you love them then keep them in the house more so you can have more yummy healthy food to eat from when you are hungry. <br>  <br>  know besides diet and exercise i recomend you drink green tea. it helps me lose weight while i am dieting and exercising! also eat celery. it is has lots of vitamin and minerals and it will keep you full! also it has water in it so it makes it a great diet food!<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  :)|`|MYhQqeV7aa	Write down everything, I mean everything, you eat or drink.

DJGxBzIvaa	To reach an excellent level? Could you be more specific?<br>  <br>  I would recommend doing a total of 300 push ups every other day. If that's too hard, make it 200. If its too easy, make it 400 (or maybe more). So, for example, if you're doing 300, break it up into 6 sets of 50 push ups. Be sure to vary types of push ups. Do some wide arm, some diamond, some plyometric (i.e. jump/clap push ups). Sometimes do as many as you can, and when doing a normal push up feels like lifting a car then drop down to your knees and keep going until failure.
2OO9U8o9aa	It differs across guys , with some the semen just flows out at ejaculation but with others it squirt quite a distance . It is the same muscle you use for peeing that controls ejaculation so you c an try and build up strength by when you go for a pee , stop in mid flow , restart , then stop again . It might be difficult if you are at urinal with other guys , or at home might splash !!!  but I am sure you can find a way . The main thing anyway is that no matter how your semen ejaculates , when you are inside a woman the sperm will swim toward its target|`|Nq4FWEIcaa	I guess to experience a more intense orgasm.  It also depends on how you ejaculate.  Some guys have their semen squirting out of the head of their penis while others have semen that kind of flows out of the head of their penis sort of like lava flowing down a volcano.  The more intense orgasms would more than likely have your semen flying out of your penis and thus be coming out faster.|`|tiMBJogRaa	prolong orgasm .it often helps increase ejaculation flow and increase pleasure.

(make sure your left inner thigh is facing the cieling). support your head with your left arm. lift your left leg straight up toward the cieling, keeping it in the same position. Do 4 sets of 25. Then switch legs. This really helped me. For outer thighs and hips, you lay with both legs extended (one on top of the other..you're on your side) so your right hip is facing the cieling, then lift that leg straight up then lower it. again, 4 sets of 25 for each leg. <br>  <br>  :)|`|1UJ8LiyEaa	Try doing squats and lunges using weights.

The mind is very powerful. With a chemical imbalance it can create a very unpleasent climate. I myself deal with the same issues often, compounded with other anxiety disorders. I have panic attacks often, though not as often as before, as well as other stress related issues. It is very difficult for an electrician to concentrate with ADD. I am beating it although it is taking everything out of me. I am also taking online classes at the time. I figure, if I have issues remebering a new aquaintance's name, I might as well push myself futher to better myself. I have fewer problems with school than everyday life. I have also dealt with this issue many times. Relaxation exercises help a bit combined with a healthy diet. Meditation and the will to be stronger help as well.<br>  <br>  WE SHALL OVERCOME!<br>  <br>  Not that strong, but trying to be!

People with immune disorders or with certain chronic illnesses are discouraged from taking the flu shot.|`|cnnu1IFtaa	No, absolutely NOT. The vaccine is a killed vaccine, which means there are no live bugs in it, so there is absolutely no way that it can cause flu.<br>  <br>  The main problem is that people get the flu shot during the winter months, when coughs and colds are much more prevalent, and people catch a cold and decide that it is flu and blame the vaccine.|`|vRcgv2fzaa	yes it can make you sick, because they give you the virus to make you immune.

Zw1rFaaUaa	I had PRK and the pain was excruciating for the first 2 days. After that, your vision will become horrible for about a week, then slowly you will see it improve. Do you remember how it felt if your contacts were turned inside out and in your eyes? Your eyes will feel like that for about a week, and being exposed to too much light will hurt. I had PRK 2 years ago and my vision is PERFECT now. PRK requires a longer recovery time than Lasik, but overall it lasts longer and is better for your eyes. Trust me, its totally worth it... just hang in there!|`|un0C52G8aa	I was scared off from getting this procedure years ago when I heard people describe some of the side effects that can occur. They can include seeing star bursts, halos, and having extreme sensitivity to light. The worst was hearing how some people had to constantly wear sunglasses, even at night.
zNn9VfRyaa	to lose weight u need to eat right and have a workout plan 5-6 days a week.u have to want it. <br>  ***try this u need to change ur diet. <br>  eat six times a day. ea of ur 3 main meals needs to combine a lean protein such as chicken breast ground turkey turkey bacon egg whts also combine that with a complex carb such as a baked potato or sweet potato wild rice brown rice oatmeal or girts. also add fresh fruit and vegies to lunch and dinner. pick fruits low in sugar like pears and berries. if u get canned vegies get ones with low sodium. eat every 3-4 hrs keep ur metablism moving.<br>  ***also the most important part is WATER drink at least 64oz. no soda or juice. water will curve ur cravings. <br>  u need to hit cardio 3-4 times a week running outside it great workout if u can hit a gym and cardio machine is great at least 30mins***<br>  also add weight/strength training 3 times a week.u can google free weight traning guides anywhere. its not hard to find things for free.<br>  ***plan ur meals ahead of time.always have a healthy snack with u so u wont be tempted to eat fast food. also if u wait to late to eat u will get so hungry u will eat the world. make time to work out start out with 30 mins then increase.its ur body treat it right. ur diet alone can help lose weight but working out makes ur body look good. shows muscles and tight skin which is sexy and beautful. stick with it ur body will amaze u!!! to be healthy and look great u need both in ur life. good luck email me if u have further questions|`|tw3Uzn1Caa	If you have a problem of constantly eating just simply try to eat things that are better for you like fruits and vegetbles!  Or just things that are healthier for you and if you can eat things with more fiber or protein while your snacking they help make you feel fuller. drink alot of water after every meal or if you think about snacking try grabbing a bottle of water and drinking it that will help you feel full and maybe not want to eat.|`|088k8bRYaa	I think that when you are stressed bored you should do something you enjoy but not eating|`|d5d3d49e305b06c6f5252e0d0508cd4baa	Link up with a friend and do things together that help keep you mind off of food.|`|HUbIzvf5aa	try to eat less and rather close together|`|F8EnH6JQaa	Get out and do something, go shopping, go for a walk, do stuff with friends when there is no food around for temptation.<br>  <br>  if you do have the munchies grab a piece of fruit.|`|AA11227341	join the club--many find themselves in the same boat so not a biggie; get all the bad stuff out or better yet don't buy it.  I saw this guy saying the "you don't have to workout"  and I said wow! so what he meant was that if a person does not like ( okay, hates, I mean really hates working out) just don't eat the bad stuff so you--or the person he was directing himself to don't have to.  <br>  so go from here, throw all the bad stuff or don't buy and set yourself a limit on the amount of calories you are going to eat for the day.  not sure of you BMI so I would say start at 1200 cals.  and count the calories(it has been proved that the best diet is that---just count the calories) and the weight comes off.<br>  <br>  Now for the overeating, there has to be a reason--some eat to comfort some inner hurt; ry to search inside of yourself and ask what is causing you to overeat--boredom--keep yourself buys; stress--what is causing the stress and try to resolve it; happiness--reward yourself with something better--put money away so you can buy something special.<br>  The idea is to avoid overeating and just try--that is all you need to ask of yourself.   And just think, how nicer you will look.   <br>  Best of effort to you .  :D
AA12239227	The ranges you quoted are right.  The main difference is the level of service you get and where the procedure is performed.<br>  <br>  For $250, you are generally going to a "clinic" that only performs LASIK procedures.  You may or may not have a doctor perfrom the procedure and most likely they are not equipped to handle any serious complications that might come up.<br>  <br>  For more money, you are likely going to get a doctor.  At the very least, you are probably going to be in a medical setting that has procedures in place to handle a wider range of complications.<br>  <br>  In general, the more money you spend, you are more likely to get a high level of care.  Going low budget should not be an option when dealing with your vision.  Do your research as to the people performing the procedure and what previous patients have to say about them.<br>  <br>  I had this done a few years ago at the UCLA eye center and I haven't had any issues with my vision at all.<br>  <br>  You can see more questions and answers about this and more at experts123.com  (<a href="http://www.experts123.com)." rel="nofollow">http://www.experts123.com).</a>  Good luck.
HK30PzNraa	A test  like this is very normal and usually very easy.Calm down,pray for GOD's blessing and everything will be fine.|`|PXnn6LoPaa	because of the law of attraction, what you focus on the most is what you'll get.  you are attracting bad luck to yourself!  change your thinking, change your world.  repeat "I am safe and everything will go perfectly"  Imagine how you will feel when it is over and it has gone well, and you feel fine and great and relieved!  think about how experienced the Dr. is and how sure of himself he is because he knows what he's donig.  think how everything will go fine.  a positive thought is more powerful than a negative thought.  if you feel a scared thought creep into your head, have a motto ready to smush out the bad thought.  something like "I am safe.  I am health.  I am calm."  Just repeat something positive.  you control your own thoughts.  quit saying you're scared and say "I am safe.  I am health.  I am calm"  And soon you will really become those things!|`|tiM2q3C9aa	I to was scared when I had an endoscopy done a few months,s ago. it was amazingly simple and fast, I was truly surprised.

SBCq2lhfaa	This sounds like pretty normal discharge although I don't think it should be itching and I think you might be suffering from thrush. This is associated with wearing tight clothing especially tights. You do get a dishcarge and can smell sometimes. You will be very itchy and have a burning feeling. It is treated with a pill to get rid of the infection and a cream to help the burning and itching. It can be bought over the counter but I'd see the doctor again and ask if it could be thrush.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	The vast majority of women who are of reproductive age, get discharge. Some women get more, some get less. Normal physiological discharge is white or clear (can be a little yellow or creamy) with a non offensive odour. If your discharge smells foul and/or stains, this is generally an indication of infection.<br>  <br>  If your Doctor took a HVS and sent it away for bacteriology and it came back clear, then there is no infection. Why do you wear two sets of underwear in bed? Tight clothing can cause thrush, the symptoms of thrush are redness, itchiness and sometimes a white lumpy discharge, there is usually no smell and quite often no discharge. <br>  <br>  I would recommend wearing cotton loose underwear and certainly not two pairs in bed- TBH you really don't need to wear underwear in bed at all, let the area breathe!<br>  <br>  I disagree with feminine washes, it won't alter discharge- you are not getting a discharge because you are in any way unclean. If you use lots of soaps- specially perfumed soaps, you will increase your chances of getting BV. Just use a MINIMAL amount of non perfumed soap twice daily and always rinse well. Never wash internally/douche.<br>  <br>  If your discharge is quite yellow, the only other possibility is cervical errosion/Ectropion. This is basically where the cells that cover the cervix are womb cells instead of cervical cells. Sometimes the surface can be treated with cautery.This is commonly seen in teenagers and in women on the oral contraceptive pill. Your Dr can determine if this is the case, on examination a red ring around the os would be visible. Have you had a smear test before? Did they come back as normal?|`|6gJODqqdaa	some people just have a heavier discharge than others. i am not sure if waering tight clothing would make it worse or not but i guess you could try sleeping with no underwear and see if it makes a difference but as i said i do not know but i dont know how that would make it worse. just try it and see. i hope that the problem goes away though but it might just be a normal thing for you unfortunately.|`|VYGViBb6aa	could be yeast infection if its yellow thats not normal white is normal itchy not normal if it hurts to pee thats not good either <br>  if the above is happening you cuold have a yeast infection id see your doc again and suggest it to him/her

rz6ePHPXaa	You're not going to die! I hate it when people say that kind of stuff about marijuana. They are usually uneducated and don't have a clue what they're talking about. Did you know that there has never (never means that since the beginning of time it hasn't happened once) that a person has overdosed or come close to dieing due to smoking marijuana? Were you drinking as well? This usually happens to me when I combine the 2, even if it's just a little of each. It could have been anything. I wouldn't worry too seriously about it unless you continue to be sick. I really doubt that just smoking made you sick. There has to be something else involved. <br>  Sorry...had to edit this one! "Gives you cancer"? wow...that's why they give it to cancer patients? That's why all of the potheads of today and yesterday have lung cancer? Smoking processed tobacco gives you cancer...the sun gives you cancer, but pot? Come on...wake up and educate YOURSELF and don't rely on what our wonderful government has pounded into your head!|`|fuQH62V1aa	dude i dunno.. i was gonna say maybe it was laced with somethin.. but if it was laced.. the other people who smoked it with you woulda felt the effects too.. so i dunno. <br>  <br>  sorry cant help ya here.<br>  <br>  but i agree with you on it being illegal only cause the govt cant profit off it. <br>  <br>  i dont see a problem with smoking weed.. as long as you can still function normally and it doesnt take over your entire life. like you go throughout the day/nite looking for your next fix.. like harder drugs make you do.|`|K6fasl6kaa	the pot may have been laced with another drug.  please quit. its illegal and causes you to make bad decisions.  greedy people sell altered drugs all the time.  they don't care if someone dies because of it.  it sure sounds like you were poisoned. it is possible that all of the contaminant in the pot was released when you hit it or you may have been the only one affected by it.  take it as a sign.  pot is not healthy, so don't rationalize.  neither are cigarettes or anything you burn and inhale. the rare medical  use of marijuana has nothing to do with its recreational use.  the legality issue of pot and tobacco and alcohol are highly based  on politics and greed and count for nothing if you get busted.  i am not closed minded and have done many things i wish i had not.  the best mistakes to learn from are someone elses.  i read the answer that another  gave, claiming to be educated and experienced while encouraging a young person to do drugs that are illegal and making excuses for the dangers.  berating those who give caring advice saddens me as does the rationalization that this person has.  i hope you are intelligent enough to see his error.|`|uQkLo6ZTaa	Weed is illegal in some/most states.

BdlGBdE5aa	First, 90% of bad breath comes from the tongue, not the teeth.  Bacteria live on the tongue and produce those bad smells.  You can see this bacteria as white stuff, especially on the back of the tongue. This must be cleaned off to control bad breath.  Brush and floss your teeth and then clean your tongue.  I use OraBrush because it is the very best tongue cleaner:  <a href="http://www.orabrush.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com</a>|`|jIccV2sOaa	Stop breathing, of course.|`|jCeylLsIaa	First of all, go have your teeth checked for dental carries and cavities. If that's not the problem, take your meals strictly on the time they should be taken (and watch those smelly foods like garlic, onions, cummin...other spices...). If that's not the case, buy a tongue scraper. Scrape it (including the inner walls of the mouth BEFORE brushing. Then have the habit of brushing your teeth after every meal (and gargle with a good mouthwash before sleeping and when you get out of bed).|`|2d754b54e0bc6a7aa248e0c6612ab6a8aa	well, I have heard that chewing parseley after dinner can help, do you brush your teeth before you go to bed? that and mouthwash will help, and if you've tried that, drink more water, it washes bad breath germs down into your stomach sometimes.<br>  I hope this helped|`|nocxxts9aa	honestly brushing your teeth 2-3 times a day and rinsing with mouthwash is a good way to keep your breath minty fresh also mints or chewing gum helps if you dont have time to brush|`|088k8bRYaa	brush your teeth 4 times a day and always have a pack of mint gum in your purse

bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	a hemmorroid is a varicose vein of the rectum, they rarely go away forever, internal or external once you have them unless you lose a lot of weight (like in pregnancy) they are pretty much there forever.<br>  It's caused by straining when going to the bathroom add, more water, and fiber to your diet it helps. They don't make you go.<br>  Anal fissues don't make you go either. <br>  You just might have a case of diarrhea and the hemmoroid is more felt and hurts during that time.
cJRFbZUaaa	Laxatives don't make you lose weight.  They just help clear your gut if you're constipated.  Before trying them, drink more water, eat more roughage fiber (the kind you find in whole grains and fruits and veggies), and exercise to get your gut moving; that's also better for helping you lose weight.

mlAwNRWhaa	Dependent personality disorder (DPD), formerly known as asthenic personality disorder, is a personality disorder that is characterized by a pervasive psychological dependence on other people. The difference between a 'dependent personality' and a 'dependent personality disorder' is somewhat subjective, which makes a diagnosis sensitive to cultural influences such as gender role expectations.<br>  <br>  <br>  Dependent Personality Disorder is a condition characterized by an over-reliance on others that leads to submissive and clinging behavior and fears of separation.
0vF6WM7Eaa	You're only fifteen. Depending on when you started your period you've still got time for your breasts to grow. Breasts also come in several different sizes and vary from person to person obviously. Girls develop at different rates so you should wait until you're older and done growing to decide whether or not a boob job is right for you because they might not still be an A cup when you're 18. Trust me. I used to be self conscious about my chest size before I started my period and even a little after but it takes some time before your body kind of gets in check and starts growing in all the right places. So give it some time!|`|jdfwP7Uoaa	everyone has things they dont like about their body but thats the body you've been given and you should be happy with what you have. i think you should leave it a few years before you decide whether to have something done, you might grow on them, or rather they might grow! :) <br>  Be happy with yourself, if you've got good health thats the main thing <br>  good luck :D|`|NxzYdoh5aa	Dont get a boob job.<br>  You shouldnt want big ones.<br>  THey usually hurt your back, jiggle all around, and a lot of guys prefer them smaller.<br>  And i really dont think you can breastfeed with a boob job.<br>  <br>  Just be happy with what you have.<br>  <br>  I am 14 and am 36A and i wish mine were smaller.|`|qqSMCeaqaa	you still have time to grow don't worry about it. you dont want big boobs.  they hurt you back sometimes and you cant wear certain fabrics cause they dont strectch and it hurts. also when you get old theyll get really saggy|`|bOaqWNxRaa	There are some advantages to being your particular size.

You need parental consent and I doubt that any sane parent would be okay with that. There's still time for you to grow; at 18 your boobs will reach full size.

GGmaSpHDaa	Lifting weights will not hinder your growth. This is just an unfortunate myth that keeps being repeated. <br>  <br>  Doctors recommend strength training for youth.  It improves athletic performance and helps prevent injury. <br>  <br>  Various medical websites have articles on this.  For example, see the following statement linked from the Cleveland Clinic: <br>  <br>  “Despite the previously held belief that strength training was unsafe and ineffective for children, health organizations such as the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) now "support children's participation in appropriately designed and competently supervised strength training programs."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.infosports.com/clvclinic/strengthtrainingforyoung.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.infosports.com/clvclinic/stre...</a><br>  <br>  NSCA position on resistance training for youth.<br>  <a href="https://www.nsca-lift.org/Publications/YouthforWeb.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.nsca-lift.org/Publications/Y...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/download/Youth%20Hot%20Topics.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/downlo...</a><br>  <br>  While you won’t stunt your growth lifting weights, you can be injured.  It is very important to get instruction in proper lifting technique.  If you don’t have an adult to instruct you, get this book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Strength-Power-Young-Athletes-Faigenbaum/dp/0736002189/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1225944504&sr=1-3" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Strength-Power-You...</a>|`|wevao7Jeaa	Lifting weights stunts your growth if you lift to much,I mean its fine to go jogging with 5 pound dumbells, but you can do as many sit ups as you want and nothing will happen.|`|6ecc210754a6de7e9d52b2bd7326c6b9aa	Absolutely Not True.

reAtqf0Maa	well you could start out simple first. like for the first few days cut back a bit. maybe don't have that dressing on the salad. or have water instead of soda. stuff like that. start simple. then slowly go to the diet part. where you have a apple instead of a brownie. or yogurt instead ofice creamm. then start exercising and dieting. this is a slow process but much simpler because you can adjust easier.<br>  <br>  <br>  now for fast weight lose )like what your doing to keep motivated) do this. take ten exercises you can do at home and crank you favorite tunes while doing this. like this<br>  <br>  1.sit ups<br>  2. jumping jacks<br>  3. squat thrusts (squats but push your arms out when you squat then pull them back in, basically getting arms in volved in squats<br>  4. crunches<br>  5.push ups( on your knees if you have to but fininsh the set)<br>  6. on your hands and knees and kick a leg back (for the but)<br>  7.elbow to knee crunches ( for obliques)<br>  8.side leg lifts<br>  9. stand up and kick a leg forward while puching arms out forward<br>  10.get on back with legs in air then bring on leg to the stomack to the other.<br>  <br>  do eack of there for one minute and DON'T take breaks in between them. the only break you should take is switching from each e xercise. it should only take a few seconds to switch though. do these for as long as you can. after you do all ten have some water and start up again. i recomend this you do this 3-6 times a day which will give you a 30 - 60 min workout. do it longer if you can! <br>  <br>  <br>  whenever you feel like eating some junk food you have to get your mind off it. play a computer game. watch tv. read a book. exercise. if the craving is so bad then have something healtthy and you will feel great after knowign you stayed strong! this will keep you motivated.<br>  <br>  know you need to learn to love dieting. for instance, strawberries are very healthy for you. if you love them then keep them in the house more so you can have more yummy healthy food to eat from when you are hungry. <br>  <br>  know besides diet and exercise i recomend you drink green tea. it helps me lose weight while i am dieting and exercising! also eat celery. it is has lots of vitamin and minerals and it will keep you full! also it has water in it so it makes it a great diet food!<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  :)|`|yxRGDjs2aa	Hi, I looked at your photo, a bit difficult to see the inner thighs, but couldn't see many problems with your shape at all!<br>  However, to answer your question, the problem with fat loss, nobody can predict where you will loose it from and how much, it would make somebody very rich if they could.  By the looks of things you are certainly moving in the right direction.  The stuff you are doing is all good. and presumably you are following a healthy eating plan?  I will advise you to try this to really work the inner thighs.  After a proper warm up and active stretch, do these squats. Stand a lot wider than normal hold a stability ball at arms length and then start your squat. Take about 3 secs to go down and 3 seconds to come up. don't let knees go over toes, go down as far as the thighs are parallel with the floor. after 10 reps when you go down hold at the bottom for 5 seconds, then do 5 small mini squats, not coming up very high. hold again for 5 seconds rest and repeat.  Don't hold you breath.  If it is too hard reduce reps. but gradually build up.  The trick is to do them really slow.  They WILL have a good toning effect on your inner thighs.  But don't neglect a good cool down and full stretch at the end of your work out.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

0be02e8cef9338abd273c570d77b584aaa	Most doctors don’t ask you about your regularity. They may think it is not important to have a bowel movement every day. In fact, some doctors think its ok when you have 2-3 bowel movements a week. some say one a day is OK. Every ones system may act differently.<br>  <br>  If you have one, two or more bowel movements a day, you may still be constipated. So the ache you have may be caused if you are straining. If  fecal matter remains along your colon walls because you don’t eat enough fiber this may be  considered constipation.  As for seeing your GP-that's always a good idea, You may wish to keep a record of the time of day you have your bowel movements, how long they are after eating, and if the movements are hard, soft, loose or what you think is normal. Once you see your GP and explain the aches and the frequency of the ache, don't be surprised he or she may request you return to the surgery with a sample on your next visit, that would be quite common.

saG3rgnzaa	The first and the most important thing to stay healthy is to eat, sleep and exercise regularly. In my opinion, since you are still you, you should not start with some "special program" to lose weight.<br>  <br>  Instead, you should try break bad habits.<br>  <br>  Something like...<br>  <br>  Wake up: Ablut 7 - 8 am (It is never good to sleep until 11am...at that time, you are gaining fat.<br>  <br>  Eat Breakfast after you wake up, latest at 9am. (You should eat so you have the energy to carry out the morning until lunch.)<br>  <br>  Lunch at 11am - 1pm (Eat alot!)<br>  <br>  Eaxtra meal (If you need, some fruit.)<br>  <br>  Dinner at 5pm - 7pm (Soup is good!)<br>  <br>  Bed time: 9pm - 11pm<br>  <br>  Never eart before bed time! Eat fruit 1h after dinner is ok. Avoid tea(makes you sleepless, or anything with high sugar, fat...)<br>  <br>  Even if you are hungry before bed time, do not eat! You should eat a proper dinner.<br>  <br>  Try to exercise daily if you want to lose weight fast. About 20 min each time. You could exercise 2 times a day. But don't over do it. Start softly.<br>  <br>  About your diet: It is easy to check what is good and bad. But as everyone knows...vegetables and fruits are very good. Avoid candies, icecream, fast food...<br>  <br>  Tip: When ever it is difficult to "stay away" from those unhealthy food, think before you act.

yxRGDjs2aa	Hi, I wouldn't get too worried about weight, but why not think about actual body fat?  Weight is an indication of health but only a guide.  But body fat % is the best way to tell if you are healthy.  A simple test is to pinch the flesh just above the hips. If it's about an inch don't worry, just follow a good healthy eating plan and moderate amounts of exercise, but if it's quite a bit more then quite clearly more attention is needed.<br>  Get back to me if I can help some more.<br>  UK Personal Trainer
rJRyVZhvaa	When a woman squirts, she expels her lubricant from her vagina.<br>  This lubricant is used to keep her sensitive tissue moist, and even wash irritants out. Her glands are hyperactive if she squirts a lot, but you shouldn't be too concerned about it.<br>  <br>   It will smell, from the hormones in the lubricant.<br>  Sometimes, it may smell very strong, from either her period, an imbalance in her hormone levels, or even from the different type (and amount) of food she ate.<br>  Hope this helps you.<br>  All the best to you.|`|44BEm1Uhaa	Because it is pee...duh!|`|OsT64mqMaa	Yessss.

87756LlTaa	A three level spinal fusion will reduce your flexibility.  You can expect that.  This kind of surgery works wonders for some, but most have residual pain.  Be sure to follow your recovery and physical therapy plan to a tee to keep as much mobility as possible.  Keep in mind, that you will have three levels which will not move.  The area will transmit normal stress to the spinal levels above and below it, causing faster wear in those area.<br>  <br>  Side note:  you mention you have fibromyalgia and osteoporosis.  There are studies showing a link between low levels of vitamin D and fibro.  Vit D deficiency also contributes to your osteoporosis.  Be sure to have you levels tested.  You don't want to be just barely in the normal range, but solidly in the center to the upper limits of normal.  This may help for fibro, and will help your recovery from surgery.  You can take Vit D and calcium supplements in the same tablet.  Be sure to have your doctor check before starting new treatment, however.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck. You are facing a tough surgery.|`|NSARVXkMaa	Inversion therapy helped me even after I was forced to have back surgery.  Of course inversion therapy is not for everyone.  It is for folks that have had and continue to suffer from back and core pain and of course painful sciatica, although I truly believe that if folks would start an inversion therapy routine prior to injury that their spinal health and over all flexibility would be improved, their spines would not have the chance to get decompressed and then pinch those nerves of where the discs are compressed.  Inversion therapy is nothing more than stretching muscles that are harder to reach and stretch without using inversion therapy.  I think just about everyone has agreed that stretching is good, right?  All I know is that my sciatica and back pain, before and after my back surgery was eliminated once I started doing inversion therapy.  I have had laser eye surgery, ear infections, spinal surgery, broken bones, the list goes on and inversion therapy is the ONLY way I have found to keep my back, core, hips, thighs and abs pain free, loose and flexible.  Like anything new that you work into your life you have to acclimate your body to the change, go slow and work up to a point where you can invert longer and for more time.  Anyone can spout facts and figures that they cut and past from some other site and talk negatively about the benefits of anything but I am a living, breathing back surgery survivor and inversion therapy, as I have said and will continue to say has saved my life and made me vital again in my life, with my family and gave me back so much freedom that had been taken away with my back problems that I had for over 20 years.  As with anything, do research and see if it's right for you.  You can visit    OnlineHealthmart dot Net    to read my personal story of how it worked for me.  Inversion therapy saved my life, I know no other way to say it.
mlAwNRWhaa	1.Wash your hands with cold water and moisturizing soap. After rinsing, fill a small bowl with warm water. Soak your hands in the warm water for about 5 minutes. <br>  2.Put about 2 tablespoons of sugar and a few drops of warm water on your hands. <br>  3.Rub hands together, as you would when applying lotion. Do this for a few minutes. <br>  4.Take a small soft washcloth and put some moisturizing soap on it. Rub each hand all over, starting with small circles on the front and back. Rinse well in the warm water. <br>  5.Pat hands gently with a clean, dry towel. Leave hands a little damp. <br>  6.Apply lotion to hands and wipe off excess. Look for brands with macadamia nut oil in them. This oil is readily absorbed by skin, and doesn't leave a greasy feel. <br>  7.Take some rosewater (available in specialty body and bath stores) and massage this gently into your hands. This softens and smooths skin tone, and gives your hands a beautiful scent|`|8466ee3d8aec016c639737d732471435aa	Try using a cocoa butter gel (Vaseline Intensive Care) makes a great one - and a lufa in the shower.

AA11332588	You could have bursitis in your hips.  Ice and anti-inflammatory pills will help.  Rest as much as you can and if you don't get relief in a couple of days, see your Dr.|`|AA11088528	It sounds crazy, but try icing your lower back between the spine and your right hip. You have likely inflamed your sciatic nerve.<br>  When the Sciatic nerve is compromised it usually causes what is called "Displaced Pain". That pain usually goes to the hip and if the Nerve doesn't get relief in a timely manner it the pain will travel down the course of the nerve which is along your thigh to your knee and across your shin to your big toe.<br>  I always alternated ice and heat 15 min each about every 2 hours and it is best to rest as much as possible until healed.<br>  Hope this helps!!

What I saw was  unsubstantiated testimonials - no way of knowing if these people had ever had the conditions they claimed, and certainly no way of knowing if they'd been 'cured'. <br>  <br>  But I'll accept they had those conditions. And as I've had cancer, the ones who'd had cancer were the ones to whom I paid most attention. And you know what? - they'd had conventional treatment too, but had chosen to credit the hemp oil with the improvement in their condition.<br>  <br>  This often happens with 'alternative' treatments - a patient has chemo and feels crap, because chemo makes you feel crap. After the chemo is over, s/he takes some 'alternative' medicine; soon s/he begins to feel better. Well, that's no surprise, you do begin to feel better when chemo is over. But s/he chooses to give the credit for feeling better, and for subsequent improvements in her/his condition, to the unproven alternative rather than to the conventional treatments, which have been rigourously tested and proven in double-blind clinical trials.<br>  <br>  And that's what's happened here.<br>  <br>  I had surgery, chemo and radiotherapy five years ago for an aggressive, advanced cancer; I am fit and well, with no sign of cancer at my last routine check-up. Chemo and rads aren't perfect, far from it; but we know because they have been tested and proven in double-blind clinical trials that they save many lives and prolong many others. The cancer patients in the film are fit and well following conventional treatment too.<br>  <br>  And anything that claims to cure everything from cancer to weight problems to insomnia has to be regarded with suspicion at best

I also had a bit of extra bleeding after the procedure which I found out was normal to have for a time and then it cleared up.<br>  <br>  When you have your procedure in the morning make sure to let the doctor know that you still have some questions that you would like to ask before they get started.

y4SUDnpaaa	I agree with Kiba, it does sound like self harm, which is only a symptom of something deeper. Do you bite yourself so that the physical pain deflects you from emotional pain? My daughter was a cutter and that's how she explained why  she did  it. Since then I've heard the same thing from mental health specialists. What ever the reason is for you doing it if you don't get mental health care it will only increase. It's dangerous, not because you're suicidal, but over time you need more and more pain to cope. Please go see a psychiatrist to make a diagnosis and give you meds that will help. Then get a therapist to talk to. It's nice to talk to someone totally objective and who will not make judgments or think you're crazy for doing it. My daughter stopped cutting and that's the way she did it.|`|85vDqn6naa	that all depends on how many times you have to bite yourself|`|tdqD9DcSaa	It could also be considered self-injury depending on how many times you do it and how often!<br>  <br>  If it is Self-Injury please get professional help before it turns into something worse like cutting.
49szVi0Eaa	Poliomyelitis is still a "virus" which can be passed around from one individual to another.  Polio is spread primarily by the feces of an infected person getting into the food and/or water chain.<br>  <br>  My wife is a polio survivor from the very early 60s and we do a lot of research into polio and post-polio syndrome.  I am also webmaster and editor for our polio group's website, ppbga.org.<br>  <br>  I read a recent article where Kenya has just announced its first polio infection in 20 years!  That's right -- Kenya has been polio-free for 20 years until recently.<br>  <br>  Kenyan children have not been recently immunized due to the post-election violence in 2008.  Although it is true that last year, polio was only endemic in four countries: Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan; those countries still have the potential to re-infect anywhere in the world, including the US and other western countries.<br>  <br>  Here is one reason:  The young parents of today are on a slow rise to reject the injection of polio and other vaccines to their young with the fear the vaccines will cause an outbreak.  Today, some vaccines are NOT required as they were some 30 years ago before children were allowed to enter the public school system, thus increasing the chances for the diseases to return -- maybe not in the near future, but if changes are not made, these viruses will return to haunt us and others in the western hemisphere.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps to answer your question and feel free to visit our website.|`|wtdic2w7aa	Of course you could, but nearly everyone in the western world is vaccinated against it as part of standard vaccination programmes.<br>  <br>  Since 1988 a global effort has been made to eradicate it and has reduced the number of cases by 99%. The Americas were declared polio free in 1994. Europe was declared polio free in 2002. As of 2006 it remains endemic in only four countries, Nigeria, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.|`|5lsqWoAqaa	"donrhan" is quite correct with all his information.  In addition, for every case of visible paralytic polio there are about 200 other people carrying the virus with no visible symptoms.  We will not be free of the polio virus until "the last child" has been vaccinated.  This also means that 3 shots of the vaccine must be administered for proper protection.  <br>  <br>  In 2007, a student returning to Melbourne from a holiday in Pakistan, was diagnosed with Polio.  Great efforts were made to contact all the other passengers on that flight.  Another epidemic is only a plane ride away if parents do not get their children vaccinated.<br>  <br>  Susan K (polio survivor)  <a href="http://international-post-polio-support.org" rel="nofollow">http://international-post-polio-support....</a>

ZkwtldYlaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop.

I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .|`|Z51fjE2Raa	How tall are your parents?<br>  <br>  You should be about your father's height... if your mum is taller than the average for a woman you may be a little taller than your dad... if your mum is waaay shorter than average you may be a little shorter.<br>  <br>  It all depends on parentage- mainly dad's height. <br>  <br>  If you are wwaay off his height- go to the GP and ask him why. <br>  <br>  He could suggest you have this thing done to stimulate bone growth- they cut the bones, and held them apart with metal plates... and the bones grows together- adding about four or five inches on... and then your bones will be raring to go- and will grow.|`|gfxJ7T4taa	weeeell......if you were younger then i would say "eat your vegetables"......but your muscles are too far developed to do anything now. sorry dude i feel for you, im 15 and im 5, 11|`|d59940d88cb243925d59f301eb2f8710aa	not happening buddy!! only plastic surgery!|`|yYtiRytEaa	Hi xuz,<br>  <br>  <br>  I was your height when I was your age. I am much older than you today. When I was 21, I noticed that my height was increasing each year. I did lots of swimming (which I did not when I was a teenager) when I left home to further studies. I have increased half an inch each year and today I am 5'9, which is not a bad height for an asian :) So I am sure you can increase your height by doing more exercises.<br>  This is what I had been through, it might work for you too!<br>  <br>  kc|`|LKyH46eHaa	What all these peopl;e are saying is not true. there is no way to actually increase your height. there is no yoga positions or anything. i knoiw it sucks being kind of short but you will grow, and there is no way that you can change your height. There are many pills and tablets you could take, but i dont recomend it because they are soemtimes very dangerous. If you really are concerned about thios problem, then you should talk to your family or your own docotor, because they actually know whats best! i hope i helped!!!!|`|SjFiTnmdaa	I don't think so you are the height you are.

And don't do stretching too much.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	You can't, sorry.<br>  <br>  Some people get an inch or two out of stretching the spine - with professional coaching and supervision of course.<br>  <br>  That's not truly adding height to your body though, it's just adding a bit more space between each joint of the spine, and they will go back to the normal size if you stop the exercises.
S2ZEikPwaa	You have to make sure you take something for pct(post cycle therapy). Because once you stop taking the steroids you body will not be producing much of it own test. That is why many people loss all there gains. Try getting your hands on hcg (pregnyl) and clomid for pct.

AA10299265	Yes. Many carbohydrates are converted to sugar. Plus, sugar is stored in the liver and other parts of the body as glycogen. Sugar is essential for life.|`|EeTs9DqUaa	The body converts starch into glucose (a form of sugar) during digestion.  Starch is in any plant based food in the form of carbs.  Sugar is only one form of carbs that you eat, there are very few foods that have no carbs at all except meat.|`|9TyEDcRzaa	YES for the simple reason that what ever we consume will be converted into sugar--protein --farts  by digestion ---depending upon what we eat --- may be the not consuming sugar may led to less sugar value in the blood  and urine in a diabetes|`|jgjZV7Ddaa	Yes, the body converts glucose from food into energy. Glucose comes ready made in sweet foods such as sweets and cakes, or from starchy foods such as potatoes, pasta or bread once they're digested. The liver is also able to manufacture glucose.|`|wjGj6uU3aa	yes your body produces glucose with is made from the starch in the complex carbohydrates you eat such as potatos and bread|`|9YCmiewRaa	Starch is broken down into sugar, but if you were on a no carb diet, the body would still produce sugar from other sources, a process called gluconeogenesis. Certain cells in the body (brain cells, for instance!!) can't get by on other energy sources, and if your blood sugar falls too low it would lead to weakness, coma, then death. Therefore, the body will try very hard to keep the blood sugar level within the ideal range.|`|FocBqCqlaa	mostly a bit, not much, but i think it does, if diabetic people dont have sugar they could have a turn (which is like a fit) so make sure that when their bloods go low take (dextro tablets) or something with energy in e.g. lucozade/lucozade tablets. to get the sugar level back up. If their sugar goes low, you will tell that:<br>  there beggining to shake. (expecially their hands/fingers)<br>  hp it helped ;)|`|lLzPfMg3aa	If a diabetic doesn't eat sugar, still body can produce sugar from  carbohydrates which he is going to eat.<br>  Read links|`|T3dbweQ6aa	Sorry but I would have to Google that one....|`|Rk46lIBwaa	Yes, basically everything we eat can be converted to glucose as this is the only was the body utilises the energy.

h3HjLZ4daa	The urge to eat non-food things is called pica.  It occasionally happens with pregnant women, and clearly with others as well.  While soap isn't toxic (no it's not going to give him polyps or cancer!) it'll cause diarrhea and stomach upset and this is not a good thing.  Also chronic diarrhea can lead to malnutrition of a sort because it moves things through the digestive tract too quickly for nutrients to be absorbed.<br>  <br>  The cause - well it could be a nutritional issue, stress, or a chemical imbalance in the brain.<br>  <br>  Strangely, soap eating isn't unheard of - a search on google got me plenty of hits!  Who knew?<br>  <br>  Your friend seriously needs to see a doctor.|`|AA10458195	He will eventually end up with colon polyps, at the least. He could end<br>  up with colon or stomach cancer. The stomach & colon has good bacteria that keeps the system healthy. This soap will destroy the<br>  good bacteria.

LPO8RlVdaa	You cant really lose fat just in one area. What you can do is lower your overall body fat percentage and tone up the muscles around your stomach, sides and back (basically your whole torso).<br>  <br>  You need a combo of a healthy diet, lots of cardio and some strength work (all over, but concentrate on your torso).<br>  <br>  For a healthy diet, you need to be eating small to medium meals regularly. 4 or even 5 times a day. Each meal (apart from breakfast which should preferably be fibre rich), should contain a balanced ammount of carbohydrates for energy, (from potatoes, rice and pasta, etc) protien (from fish, chicken, occassional red meat is fine, soya is good too) and plenty of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants (simple fresh fruit and veg). Eat like this and make sure you are well hydrated (fruit juice is as good as water, any fluid counts, but some fluids have negative effects too, such as alcohol or caffiene rich drinks.)<br>  <br>  Now for the science bit: Protien is essential for repairing muscle and keeping the muscle you do have healthy (this includes your heart, lungs, brain etc). You naturally lose the ammount of protien you have throughout the day (through urine etc) so this needs to be replenished regularly on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  Carbohydrates are essential for energy. You won't be able to function without it. It also regulates body fat and glucose etc.<br>  <br>  Vitamins and minerals are obviously essential for a variety of reasons. For normal growth and development, for the healthy maintenance of the cells, tissues, and organs that make up our bodies, and also to let us efficiently use chemical energy provided by food.<br>  <br>  You can have a wide range of healthy meals with this, from Thai, Chinese, Italian, British, Indian, etc. Just make sure each meal contains balanced ammounts of these three. On the bright side too, fresh veg and rice and pasta is a lot cheaper than crappy junk food!<br>  <br>  This doesn't mean you cant have chocolate or pizza/takeaway/etc, just save them as very occassional treats.<br>  <br>  The big secret to keeping a healthy weight and staying healthy is EXCERCISE, particularly cardio excercise. <br>  <br>  Cardio exercise includes any form of excercise such as running/jogging/swimming/cycling etc that gets your heart rate pumping and you sweating and out of breath. It will not only burn calories and reduce your body fat levels, therefore making you 'slimmer' by having less fat on you, but will also improve your resting heart rate and lung function, making you healthier. <br>  <br>  I cannot understate the importance of cardio excercise. It is this which will basically burn the body fat off you. <br>  <br>  But you have to remember that once you have shed a bit of fat you have to have a nice toned body underneath the fat to show off. <br>  <br>  Strength training will help you strengthen and tone your muscles. This is done with the use of weights or by free training.<br>  <br>  There are essentially (without getting overly complicated) two types of strength excercises based on different types of muscle fibres depending on wether you want to build size, bulk and power, or just 'tone' up the lean muscles an get more muscle endurance.<br>  <br>  Heavy weights with short reps/sets will build your fast twitch muscle fibres and build size, power and strength. Imagine big guys at the gym lifting heavy weights. <br>  <br>  But if you use light to medium weights with lots of reps/sets you will excercise your slow twitch muscle fibres, you wont build size, but you will tone up your body and train muscle endurance. This will obviously make you 'look' healthier and more toned, but will also increase your metabolism (as your muscles demand more energy) so you will burn calories faster. These muscles are also excercised a lot with cardio workouts (i.e your leg muscles when running).<br>  <br>  Your arms for example, will need bicep curls and tricep dips using weights and reps of your choice (heavy - low reps, light - lots of reps) and also shoulder excercises such as holding the weights at your waist and lifting them perpendicular to your side or in front of you, etc etc.<br>  <br>  Your stomach will need excercises that cover the entire torso. Leg raises for your lower ab wall, crunches, sit ups and planks for your upper and all over ab wall, oblique twists for your sides and superman stretches for your lower back for example.<br>  <br>  These are just basic examples, there are literally hundreds of excercises, but it is impossible to show you on a site like this, get a trainer at your gym to show you some but remember the basic rules of muscles and weights. <br>  <br>  As far as excercise goes, you should aim to strike a balance between cardio training and strength training, this way you will build good strong and toned muscle, but also keep your body fat levels down and increase your heart and lung performance, making you much fitter and healthier.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	Eat a little less and do a lot more regular vigorous exercise.|`|tw3Uzn1Caa	I'm sorry to say but it is impossible to lose spot fat reduction. meaning you cant lose just fat in your stomach area. You need to just simply do cardio workout for 30-60 min 3 times a week or so.  Doing sit ups, crunches, leg raises and all that will give you a set of abs but does nothing to burn the fat away.|`|elY5vkVyaa	Brock is right; no matter how many times this question is asked the answer must always be the same: you cannot remove fat only from one specific place on your body without surgery, in your case your body happens to prefer to store fat around your belly.

mlAwNRWhaa	Scabies is a common skin infection that causes small itchy bumps and blisters due to tiny mites that burrow into the top layer of human skin to lay their eggs.<br>  <br>  The burrows sometimes appear as short, wavy, reddish, or darkened lines on the skin's surface, especially around the wrists and between the fingers. A child who has contracted scabies can also develop a bumpy red rash.|`|AA10558731	Scabies is a contagious skin infection characterized by superficial burrows, intense itching and secondary infection. It is caused by a mite called Sarcoptes scabiei. The word scabies itself is derived from 'scabere', which is the Latin word for scratch. It is most likely to be found in smaller dogs.<br>  <br>  Contracting scabies has nothing to do with being dirty or not bathing on a regular basis as one responder suggested, because anyone can become infected. Scabies is highly contagious and can be spread by scratching, picking up the mites under the fingernails and simply touching another person's skin. They can also be spread onto other objects like keyboards, toilets, clothing, towels and anything else that the mite may be rubbed off onto, especially if a person is heavily infested.|`|4xOXiZcNaa	It's caused because the person with the scabies IS A FILTHY PIG.. because it COMES FROM FILTH... and people who are too LAZY or TOO STUPID to TAKE A BATH or a SHOWER tend to get those buggies in their filthy skin.|`|paLqZBMMaa	Scabies is a disease that is relatively common and can happen to anyone. This disease, scabies can happen to anyone regardless of their status or their race. Scabies is a mite that lives on a host, human or animal. Scabies lay their eggs on this host, in small channels they have created under the skin and in a few days the eggs will development into mites. There are various treatments to kill the eggs and adult mites. However,   scabies will return again if the person is exposed again to the mite, or the treatment is not effective.<br>  <br>  Scabies has many symptoms, some of which are more obvious than others. If you have scabies you will experiencing a feeling of itching, especially at night and you will notice red dots or blisters on the skin. These are just some of the symptoms of scabies. In adults, scabies live mainly in the armpits, the wrists, teats, elbows, stomach, on the fingers and the genital region. Children are much more of the susceptible.   Your whole body can be changed with scabies. In almost all cases of scabies, patients develop an infection first and then begin to scratch, damaging the skin and causing further harm. Once you become infected, itching begins in two weeks. But if it is not the first time you have been infected, then the symptoms of scabies may appear as soon as five days.<br>  <br>  Another important thing to become aware of is how the disease is transmitted. Mites, or scabies can be transferred from one person to another only by a simple touch of the hand. Sexual contact may also be another  way to contact scabies mites. Scabies mites can not live more than a few days without a host, their survival is dependent upon a number of factors, mainly temperature and humidity.<br>  <br>  Diagnosis of scabies can be a very difficult task for the doctor as scabies symptoms are similar to many other medical conditions. For the diagnosis of scabies, the doctor must first take samples of skin of the patient. Placing the skin under a microscope to determine whether a sign of the scabies mites. Another type of scabies diagnosis is the application of the ink on the skin of the patient.<br>  <br>  The treatment of scabies is not very difficult or costly.

IMPvzBk1aa	Call your doctor.  Enemas stimulate the vagus nerve and if your heart condition is such that the heart tissue is irritable, that stimulation can trigger an arrhythmia.  Often a small fleet enema is considered fine, but not without the okay from the doctor who knows your case.|`|ZjhQ6PL8aa	Regular treatments should be avoided by people with heart disease. It also may stimulate the vagus nerve which can result in arrhythmias like bradycardia.

AA11088528	This is a tricky question. It depends on your age and the extent of your shoulder injuries on what would help you. If you have rotator cuff problems now then exercise will be detrimental to them.<br>  If it is just tendonitis (arthritis) you can take Aleve which is Naproxen. It is likely what a doctor would prescribe for minor arthritis pain at first. If your damage is too painful with exercise and you are I would say older than 35, Celebrex may be something that your doctor could suggest to help your mobilty along. <br>  Like I said it is a tricky question because there are many elements that would have to be considered before a correct treatment could be determined.<br>  Hope this helped some!

It can't hurt, and is inexpensive and easy to do. You can buy the box of salts at any drug store and a small plastic basin and follow the direction on the box.

Purging only gets rid of one third of calories taken in so it really does not work. You know it's not OK because you're aware enough to ask the question, find some good psychological help that teaches you how to accept and love yourself - then looking after your physical health will follow.

VWNiOxcvaa	My Natural Eyesight Improvement teacher has had many students who have improved their vision enough to have their lens requirements removed from their driver's license. The minimum requirement for driving is 20/40, but sometimes this isn't strong enough for some to drive comfortably at night.<br>  <br>  I believe that even people with lasik should still have something on their driver's license to indicate their handicap. They still have blurry vision habits and blurry vision habits reduce our complete vision dramatically. They reduce our brain speed, our 3D vision, and our whole picture awareness.|`|RgwJ1PNnaa	I guess that unless your eyesight improves enough you'll always have the restriction on your licence.

xvey8ixPaa	Actually, this is a normal part of the definition of 'health" for your type of plan. "vision care" is separate from "eye health"   So, you would need to have a separate vision car plan that covers your refraction and eyewear. This is not a new thing and has been in existence for many, many years. the typical comprehensive eye exam consists of about 76% eye health tests and exam and about 25% vision (refraction). It is not that it has been "taken out" only separated, and different types of plans cover different things. With most of my patients that have UHC, they hav eeither a Medical Eye Services, or a Vision Service Plan, or Eyemed Vision plan that they have separately, just like you would have a separate Dental plan, like Delta Dental. see what I mean?|`|LV75kgwraa	Yes I agree, both dental and vision are extemely important for your health. Most insurance's will add these to your plan for an extra fee. I would call them and find out. <br>  <br>  An eye doctor can do an eye health check without giving you a refraction.  Refracting is seperate from the actual examination. Your insurance will cover the actual exam, but if you want the refraction and written Rx you will have to pay for that part. The charges are itemized and broken down for billing procedures.
vwm0uFoCaa	Eat a large green salad daily - large 1-2lbs of greens.<br>  <br>  Eat plenty of fruit - Have a large banana smoothie after workouts to replenish you.<br>  <br>  Protein is not used directly as fuel for the body and neither is it for muscular activity.  Despite many bodybuilders, if not all (with a few exceptions I have come across), consuming large quantities of protein and upping their percentage to 30 or even 40% of total calories, they do not need to – they are misinformed.  It is quite easy to be misinformed in this day and age with the amount of junk science shifting about and not being able distinguish fact from fiction for the most part.<br>  <br>  Mike Benton in Proteins in the Diet [2] states:<br>  <br>  “Protein is not used directly as fuel for the body or for muscular activity. In muscular work, excretion of nitrogen as a result of protein usage increases only very slightly. Instead, it is the excretion of carbonic acid and absorption of oxygen that increase. These changes indicate that an expenditure of energy is derived mainly from non-nitrogenous foods (such as carbohydrates and fats) and not, from protein”.<br>  <br>  So protein isn’t used directly as fuel meaning there is no use in consuming lots of protein for muscle growth.  <br>  <br>  Mike Benton goes on to say:<br>  <br>  “It is true that the body can use protein to generate fuel for physical activity, but it does so by breaking the protein down into a carbohydrate form. Protein is used as fuel only when there is either an excess of proteins or a lack of carbohydrates. When this occurs, the body splits off the nitrogenous matter from the protein molecule and uses the remaining carbon contents to produce fuel. This process not only involves a net loss of energy, but it also places an unnecessary strain on the liver, kidneys and other organs to eliminate the unusable nitrogenous wastes” [2].<br>  <br>  Animal versus Vegetable Protein  <br>  <br>  No one fruit or vegetable contains all 9 but animals do.  This has led many to believe that vegetable protein is inadequate and animal protein is necessary for a healthy diet.  However, this is simply untrue because we now know that we don’t need to consume all the amino acids together or even on the same day, meaning that if we get a variety of greens and vegetables we do not have to consume animal protein.<br>  <br>  However is animal protein better than vegetable protein?  Surely it would be easier just to eat animal because at least then you don’t have to worry about variety.  Yes, for efficiency animal protein is much more efficient, however efficiency doesn’t mean that it is the best choice.  T Colin Campbell explains this in The China Study as follows:<br>  <br>  "The concept of quality really means the efficiency with which food proteins are used to promote growth. This would be well and good if the greatest efficiency equalled the greatest health, but it doesn't and that's why the terms efficiency and quality are misleading. In fact...there is a mountain of compelling research showing that "low-quality plant protein, which allows for slow but steady synthesis of new proteins, is the healthiest type of protein...Plant proteins may be lacking in one or more of the essential amino acids, as a group they do contain all of them." <br>  <br>  On top of this, as mentioned before, when rats were fed over 10% protein with aflatoxin they developed cancer.  The protein they were fed was animal protein.  Campbell went on to test plant protein on rats in the same way and discovered that plant protein did not promote cancer like animal protein did.<br>  <br>  So therefore it is important to get our protein from plants as opposed to animals if we want to maintain our health.<br>  <br>  Animal is also much higher in fats, which can also cause a problem for our health.|`|AA11579568	Tofu is a great way to go.|`|i5fmUugNaa	soy and tofu both contain protein I believe.<br>  <br>  they even have this tofu that you blend in a shake.

If you are in such a hurry it is better to BURN the fat, not starve it.<br>  <br>  To explain it to you more throughfully, Lots of muscle burn lots of calories. If your body notice that you aren't eating enough, it won't answer by burning more fat. Rather, it will burn the muscle instead to save the fat for as long as possible. Your body enters the starvation mode. What then happens when you eat again, is that the body will truly savor every gram of fat you consume for a long time, until it is certain that the starvation is over.

ULTRJJ6waa	Hi Trisha. It takes about 6 to 8 weeks for your body to adjust to a dose of thyroid medicine. A week is nowhere near enough time. Unfortunately thyroid medication is not a quick fix. Sometimes it can take many months to feel better. You have to have a lot of patience when dealing with a thyroid problem. I've been on meds for 9 months, and i'm still sick ( can't seem to find the right dosage ). My symptoms have improved slightly, but i still feel bad most days. Give it a few more weeks, hopefully you will have better results then me. Good luck. Feel better soon :-)|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	You should feel the full effects of any dosage change in about 6 weeks. <br>  <br>  So you need new blood tests in 6 weeks to see how much the medication did or did not help. Then you have the dosage adjusted again. Keep repeating until you are stable any symptom free. Then you can reduce the frequency of your blood tests down to about every 6 months.
Vp1Wzu07aa	I have "suddenly" become overweight. A couple years ago I broke off my 20 year relationship and stopped a serious drug habit (meth)...no rehab. This took a huge toll obviously and when I started gaining weight I thought it was naturally due to the stress and depression and lack of the drug. <br>  <br>  I gained 60 pounds in 3 months and I got more depressed. Another few months went by and I gained another 30 pounds and got severely depressed before my mom convinced me to go to the doctor. I agreed and found out that I have a thyroid problem. My thyroid is practically non functioning. I am on meds now but the weight is still there<br>  <br>  In my mind I am still the skinny girl who wears a size 9, but every time I pass by my reflection I see myself at size 20 and I am devastated. I honestly don't know what to do with myself. I too wish there was a pill to make it all go away. Or at least a time machine so that I can go back and stop the gain in the first place. <br>  <br>  I have to admit I am lazy. I always have been. If I could workout and not sweat, that would be great. lol. I hate to sweat. I just feel so trapped in this body. I do not overeat and for the most part eat wisely. I work in a warehouse and get moderate exercise daily. I just can't seem to lose the weight and get my life back.|`|cxip3nA8aa	Well, I'm definitely not overweight but I can say: stop feeling sorry for your self day and night and decide to do something about your weight.

vxpxHl6daa	Eating a big breakfast won't necessarily speed up your metabolism. Eating breakfast at all starts your metabolism, which is why breakfast is the most important meal of the day. You should probably eat a normal breakfast, lunch a bit larger, and then dinner a bit smaller. Try not to eat after six, but if you must, don't eat after eight. The later you eat after six, the more weight you put on.|`|2rG7rYOWaa	ur right on track|`|dJuEtGxraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|3je7nsJYaa	people say to eat a big greakfast becuase it stops you getting hungary before lunch time. but the breakfast has to be healthy, healthy foods fill you up more and a load of rubbish for breakfast is no good for you. stick to cereals with maybe one of your 5 a day use low fat mlk abnd stop the snacking good luck.<br>  tip- every time you fell hungary make your self a warm drink like tea or coffe without loads of sugar and just sip on that|`|zNn9VfRyaa	yes to lose weight u need to eat right and have a workout plan 5-6 days a week.u have to want it. <br>  ***try this u need to change ur diet. <br>  eat six times a day. ea of ur 3 main meals needs to combine a lean protein such as chicken breast ground turkey turkey bacon egg whts also combine that with a complex carb such as a baked potato or sweet potato wild rice brown rice oatmeal or girts. also add fresh fruit and vegies to lunch and dinner. pick fruits low in sugar like pears and berries. if u get canned vegies get ones with low sodium. eat every 3-4 hrs keep ur metablism moving.<br>  ***also the most important part is WATER drink at least 64oz. no soda or juice. water will curve ur cravings. <br>  u need to hit cardio 3-4 times a week running outside it great workout if u can hit a gym and cardio machine is great at least 30mins***<br>  also add weight/strength training 3 times a week.u can google free weight traning guides anywhere. its not hard to find things for free.<br>  ***plan ur meals ahead of time.always have a healthy snack with u so u wont be tempted to eat fast food. also if u wait to late to eat u will get so hungry u will eat the world. make time to work out start out with 30 mins then increase.its ur body treat it right. ur diet alone can help lose weight but working out makes ur body look good. shows muscles and tight skin which is sexy and beautful. stick with it ur body will amaze u!!! to be healthy and look great u need both in ur life. good luck email me if u have further questions|`|M58bB7RLaa	well if you eat a big breakfast its said that you wont go for another small snack quickly.

2KC467tFaa	It's bothering you because you have trust in your boyfriend. You've been betrayed and hurt in your past. You're feeling extremely vulnerable right now. He should have said something to her. Just talk to him, let him know you need him to be patient, and ask him whatever it is that you feel like you need from him. I would be extremely uncomfortable if that happened to me. I know my husband isn't going anywhere, but keeping his distance from other women is a "respect" thing. I have a male friend who said I was "hot" and "pretty". I told my husband during a conversation. It made him extremely uncomfortable. I haven't talked to my friend since. I'm not dropping my friends because of my husband, but I will keep a distance until my husband is comfortable with me being friends with him. My husband never asked me to do a single thing. I'm doing this on my own because I love and respect my husband. I will not do anything that hurts him or makes him feel uncomfortable. Just talk to your boyfriend, and keep that communication open. He won't know how you're feeling or what you're thinking unless you tell him. Good luck, and know that there is nothing wrong with you feeling like this. It's natural.|`|AA10169678	You are experiencing "fear of abandonment" which is related to your emotional history. It has nothing to do with your partner.<br>  Find a psychotherapist.

Talk with him.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.<br>  <br>  PS:  you are way better looking than her.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	just make it clear to him on how uncomfortable it makes you feel. he needs to know so that if something else happens that you don't approve of, he can't come to you with an excuse.

Draw backs include exposing delicate breast tissue to excessive germs (like the MRSA - the really scary, deadly germ).  Also, lack of support for the breasts can lead to permanent damage, the least of which is droopage.  That will make you look smaller.  <br>  <br>  Besides, 34B is a good size.

Major benefits of an exercise bike is that you are not hostage to the weather and you will not suffer orthopedic injuries.  The belly fat will be reduced as a function of overall weight loss.  If you decide to buy an exercise bike, you should be mindful that the heavier the  weight of any exercise equipment, the better and more durable your equipment will be.  Quality equipment is needed to assure that you will use it regularly.  The key to success.

What would you get out of it. The therapist gets the same pay whether you are stoned or straight.

I would say if it was a counselor that you were seeing for addiction they would end the session. God Bless Reggie|`|9pDEhA1Xaa	It happens all the time!

There is really nothing that can be done about this. <br>  The other cause that most people know about is a deficiency of growth<br>  hormone, which is produced by the pituitary gland situated at the base<br>  of the brain. If a deficiency of this hormone is discovered early<br>  enough in life, it is sometimes possible to give treatment with<br>  injections of growth hormone to increase height. However, by the time<br>  you get to 17 years of age, your bones may not respond to the effect<br>  of the hormone. The only way to find out if you have this condition is<br>  to discuss it with your doctor. Blood tests an X-rays to see how your<br>  bones are growing can usually make the diagnosis, but for treatment<br>  you would need referral to a specialist. These investigations should<br>  also show if there is any other cause for your short stature. <br>  But you should not think that it will definitely help you. Medical<br>  science can not make you the way you want to be - and it is true not<br>  only for height - so it's better to accept yourself as you are. Tall<br>  people are not necessary happier than short people - look at the<br>  tallest man in Ukraine, who was stripped of his title, lives alone<br>  with his mother, and has constant legs pain!<br>  The exercises they advertise on-line may increase your height<br>  temporarily for 0,5 - 1 cm, it's hardly noticeable and does not worth<br>  the trouble: your height varies during the day on its own.<br>  Very occasionally, surgeons will try an operation to lengthen the<br>  bones in the legs. This is very difficult, and takes many months or<br>  even years, and a series of operations. It is a dreadful operation,<br>  and I mentioned it only because you may have heard of it. Never<br>  consider mutilating yourself for a miserable increase in height, and<br>  be happy as you are.

That is the safest, shortest and best way to solve this problem immediately, safely and harmlessly.<br>  If you start experimenting with potions and quick fixes from people you don't know, then you are putting your life in their hands.<br>  <br>  STOP! DO NOT DO THAT!<br>  <br>  If you are not sure on what to do in your condition and you are feeling dizzy or feel faint, then call a doctor office or 911 and have a ambulance respond. Do not wait! Swelling can restrict your breath ways and blood sources that could cause you harm if you decided to drive somewhere.<br>  <br>  But generally, once they have found out what caused the outbreak, most people are treated and released within 24 hrs.<br>  <br>  But never take medical advice over the internet!<br>  Even if it is a doctor you are speaking with, they can not diagnose your problem over the internet safely, because you are not there for you to examine and you may not be able to define the right symptoms to them to get you good advice.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps<br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  Be safe!<br>  <br>  Ex-First Responder<br>  <br>  Kitty Hawk Fire Dept, NC
zzSEtUvBaa	You can take an OTC antihistamine to get rid of them temporarily.<br>  <br>  An allergy test would be helpful in determining what is causing the hives. If you're allergic to a food, then you have to stop eating it. If it is something else, then you should try to avoid the allergen as much as possible. <br>  <br>  Sometimes, it is not an allergy that causes hives. They could be caused by a viral or a bacterial infection or stress. In this case, they would last up to six weeks.

Depression doesn't need a big to be triggered, the little things can pile up and feeling bad about yourself is a sign of depression.

9YMLsk7Taa	Flood it with saline, using sterile technique apply an antibacterial agent, cover with clean sterile 2x2's or 4x4's depending on the size, cover the 2x2's with a large flat pad like a abdominal pad and tape making a square. Depending on drainage this should be replaced at least daily maybe 1-2 x's a day. You can get everything you need at Walgreens or CVS pharmacy. Also you may need an antibiotic (oral) from your doc. Watch for fever, redness, warmth to the touch as these are all signs of an infection. Good luck...|`|P0WyZU8Uaa	After my kidney transplant they had to reopen a large portion of my incision.  It had to be cleaned at least twice daily with long Q-Tips and saline fluid.  You must make sure it is cleansed thoroughly because pockets can form (happened to me) and get neglected if not seen right away that can turn into very serious health problems.  I'm sure your doctor has given you instructions on how to do this.  Just follow to the letter what he has said to do.<br>  <br>  Depending on the size of the wound, your dressings should be size appropriate.  Gauze needs to be packed into the wound after moistening it with saline fluid (not dripping just moist).  Don't be afraid the patient is fairly numb and won't feel that much.  If any pockets, make sure they get packed ... very important!  Once the wound is packed then lay a topical dressing to cover it and seal it with an appropriate tape (some people are allergic to latex and use the paper tape).  Above all ... make sure your hands are clean, put on a pair of surgeon's gloves, lay out all the necessary  items (beforehand) and don't touch anything else until you are finished dressing the wound.<br>  <br>  You'll be in my prayers ... hope all goes well for you and hubby.|`|AA10729675	Go see a doctor.<br>  Once the doctor has cleaned it, I would suggest you find someone to do Reiki on it.

Speedy recovery!|`|c981080a505c06221f237c3acf97f037aa	This sounds very iffy to me.A deep wound needs to be cleaned and disinfected,has a Dr.seen it?

Deep open wounds are not meant for you to just treat like a plain cut. Doctor needs to check it!|`|t1zlbOURaa	To really be able to answer this, you should find a doctor to examine it. There are many different kinds of structures on the back. (is it over muscle or bone? which muscle or bone? what kind of movement happens there, etc.) "Deep" wounds should also be examined by a doctor and cleaned, because an infection in a deep wound could turn out to be life-threatening.
oiNkygNtaa	i kinda know how you feel its really hot here to and im stuck wearing long sleeves as well, not to mention they keep touching me making my wounds hurt even worse. honestly though i don't care as much as i should. id rather suffer though this then give up the only one thing i have left that brings me happiness.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I read recently in a newsmagazine or on yahoo health that virtually all people who cut have a serious underlying psychiatric disorder, or a personality disorder (which is still a psychiatric disorder, but you usually get counseling for it instead, I think is the main difference).  So I'm going to say, you cut because there is something the matter - you need professional help.  Try seeing a counselor & if you make no progress after a few months, then consider you may have a mental illness, such as bipolar or major depression, that would require meds.  Especially suspect this if mental illness runs in your family. If you have been sexually or emotionally abused, that is another cause of emotional dysregulation, and therapy can help a lot.<br>  <br>  You won't get better without professional help of some kind.|`|bBBcbFmWaa	Have you tried wearing open stich long sleeve sweaters? The crochet yarn has loose holes, but still gives coverage. Also sheer and mesh long sleeves can cover without being hot and heavy.<br>  <br>  I totally understand. It's like finally you feel good enough where it might be possible to enjoy your day, to do something that would make you feel better, but the anxiety over people seeing your scars and making comments or asking questions ruins it. The irony is that if you're interacting with people, you feel so much better than you did when you were alone and cutting. Little do they know that their big freak-out should have been yesterday when it was worse! Of course no one ever seems to be amused by the irony. I can't make it better, but I appreciate your situation. Not being able to enjoy your day is like putting pink sugar icing on a cake made out of poop -- so much worse because for a moment you think that it might be good after all. <br>  <br>  I hope you feel a bit better soon and have a fabulous day when you go out.|`|g22GoipQaa	Arrh yep I feel ya pain!<br>  <br>  The only things you can do is try and feel more comfortable...<br>  I wear shorts/ skirts- bare legs, and loose sleeves... (if possible with sleeves that are loose down to the wrist and then get tighter so that your sleeves don't flap down your arms...) and then it's still light and airy.<br>  <br>  But yep I know it's horrible!|`|3reHk4I1aa	i think that you might feel upset with yourself and you just want to hurt yourself but dont cut whenever you get the urge to cut snap a rubber band to your wrist until you dont feel like you need to cut any more|`|qRJztNNZaa	hey <br>  thats is proably just ur way for getting anger out. i would suggest maybe hitting a pillow or getting something like a dummy to cut? idk<br>  hope i helped:)|`|yWRZDGfcaa	Whether you're cutting yourself as a distraction from emotional pain, or hoping someone will notice and offer help, or just because you feel like you deserve to be hurt, it's dangerous and you need to be careful when you do this.  Stay away from your wrists and never cut horizontally (down the length) on your arm.  Neosporin ointment, peroxide, or iodine is good for cleaning your cuts and will reduce scarring.<br>  <br>  I'm not encouraging you to cut AT ALL but I'm being realistic in case you decide to wait before seeking help.  DON'T WAIT.  But if you do please be careful,  I had a friend in high school rushed to the hospital from cutting too deep.  He had no intentions of dying from cutting and was horrified that it got that close.<br>  <br>  This is a sign of something wrong inside you emotionally.  Lots of "normal" people need emotional help, yours just happens to leave evidence on your body.  It doesn't mean you're a freak or anything like that, and by getting help a doctor can reassure your parents if they don't understand.<br>  <br>  Honestly the thing for you to do today might be to wear short sleeves, because it would probably would result in someone offering help pretty fast.   But I know you probably wouldn't feel comfy with that, and your peers (I'm assuming you're in jr high or high school)  probably won't understand.<br>  <br>  I suggest you go to an adult you like and trust, like a teacher, a friends mom, a school counselor, nurse, or even your parents!   The adult you tell will have to talk with your parent/s, but if you're afraid to tell them yourself this is a good way to avoid confrontation and get the right help.  Cutting is the most common in teenagers, and most teachers etc will probably know immediately whats going on when you show them.<br>  <br>  Another idea I've thought of is going to the nurse when you are wearing long sleeves on a warm day, and telling her you think you have a fever, or maybe you're just hot and removing your shirt or jacket to expose your arms and hope she says something and offers help.  If she doesn't it doesn't mean she doesn't care, it just means she didn't know what to do.  This isn't the best solution, but it could be easier if you're simply afraid the words won't come out of your mouth.  But you'll need to work up the courage to talk about it with someone if it doesn't work.<br>  <br>  But please tell somebody and ask for help as soon as possible.  This is a sign of more serious things going on inside you and the emotional scarring could end up much worse than the scars you leave on your arms.
lPO4D8PLaa	If your mother had strep throat, its quite possible you got infected.  A physican can do a Rapid Strep test (they will swab the back of your throat and then run a test on the sample) to see if you have strep throat (in which case you will need antibiotics prescribed).|`|hVvhrc0haa	It is possible you have strep considering your mom did, but if you did have strep I'm sure you would know. Strep throat feels much worse then the common "sore" throat. Maybe it's just the beginning, but the best thing you could possibly do is to go get that checked out asap.

83b41af6e9dad5161f377d8dd731e945aa	Humm. I can't say that I have heard a specific instance of what you describe, but while trying to investigate what happened, I make these observations:<br>  <br>  You equate the feeling with one associated with Ecstasy.<br>  <br>  Ecstasy works by making your brain use massive amounts of serotonin.. so much that it actually depletes your brains reserves. (The next day low)<br>  <br>  So- Look at Serotonin related situations.<br>  <br>  New studies have shown that even mild use of Ecstasy can change your brain chemistry <br>  <br>  They do prescribe serotonin uptake inhibitors for social anxiety.<br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/selec..." rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/selec...</a><br>  <br>  Serotonin uptake inhibitors work by not allowing your brain to re-absorb serotonin as much, and forcing more of it to be "on hand" to do it's day to day work.<br>  <br>  Long term use of Ecstasy has shown to permanently reduce the available serotonin in the brain.<br>  <br>  Look into St. John's wort.<br>  <br>  St. Johns wort is a Serotonin uptake inhibitor. It has the same chemical compound as Zoloft (Prescription Serotonin uptake inhibitor).<br>  <br>  St. John's wort is an herbal suppliment available in healthfood stores.<br>  <br>  Many studies have been done, and it has been confirmed to assist with mild depression.  (I have not heard about social anxiety tests)<br>  <br>  doctors are not going to recomend St John's wort.  I ask my doctor about it (for use with PMS) and his response was:<br>  <br>  >There are no industry standards for the people who produce the capcils- so the TRUE concentraiion can vary from brand name to brand name.<br>  >There are other chemical compounds that we dont' know what they do.<br>  <br>  Well. not wanting to pay for Zoloft, I took St. John's wort anyway.  It was as if my doctor was trying to convince me that it wasn't strong enough.<br>  <br>  So- following posted studies, I took the same amounts as those in the studies... (which happens to be the commerically available dosage)<br>  in 3 weeks, my moods leveled out.. WAY out.  It really DOES work.<br>  <br>  BTW- have you ever heard that you can't get high from Ecstasy if you are on Zoloft?  Guess why?  A seretonen uptake inhibitor.. stops the drug from working... so, if you decide to take St,. john's wort, and try to take E, You will not be able to get high.|`|irbHUmx4aa	You probably feel guilt from taking Ecstasy in the past and you imagined this feeling to make you feel good about yourself.|`|da334b25d8115d3095d58f9aff385833aa	maybe it was the holy spirit, or maybe it was a flashback on ecstasy, you never know,  I have heard of flashbacks from people on LSD but not ecstasy, but I know what you mean about people saying oh its the holy spirit, but like i said that is a pretty big sign i so maybe it was.  at least you dont dance around with rattlesnakes and touch ur forehead and fall over and say you are healed!!!

Y4ogWjHOaa	You are certainly no moronic little girl and you have a lot more sense than your father obviously does.<br>  <br>  I know why your father thinks his brain is banging against his skull, it is the force of the cough making his head throb and indeed that does feel as though your brain is falling out of your skull, it is a horrible feeling.<br>  <br>  However, the brain is encased in cerebral  fluid which prevents the brain hitting against the skull.<br>  <br>  The only way that can happen is in a baby or young child if it was shaken or in an adult if the fell to the floor banging their head hard on the floor or against a hard object. Even then it would more likely just shake a bit (concussion) If it does hit the skull for whatever reason ( and this really would have to be a severe bang on the head or a very hard fall) it would cause compression. This is a serious medical emergency. He would be confused if not unconscious, his pupils would be unequal and not responding to light, oh I could go on and on.<br>  <br>  There is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT IT IS POSSIBLE for your father's brain to be hitting against his skull as the result of a cough.           <br>  <br>  You are obviously the sensible member of the family and never allow anybody to convince you any different darling.<br>  <br>  Lots of love.<br>  <br>  Mel.XX|`|74d22a359a13b539bf60f128a3450a53aa	I would think so. <br>  Sounds like your Dad has more problems than just his cough. <br>  I'd just laugh next time he says it & say Ok Dad, if you think so...Anything you say..<br>  But then I have been called disrespectful on occasion.|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	If his brain were 'hitting the inside of his skull' he would be losing consciousness at the very least. Tell him that his brain is encased in fluid, which serves to cushion it so it couldn't just 'hit the inside' of his head.<br>  <br>  F.Y.I. - When a person is struck in the face, their brain shakes around inside their skull and causes the electrical signals running up and down the nerves to short-circuit, this causes a 'knock-out'.

AA10450066	This is a real disorder.It sounds like you've done as much as you could for yourself, but the deficiency's you've mentioned all cause fatigue, for the vitamin d, and iron you can take the OTC vitamin D and ferrous sulfate,but ask your doctor on the potency and dosage times per day.Also the B12 can be a symptom of pernicious anemia and if you do have that you'll need to get a b12 shot every month.The only way for them to know for sure is to have a bone marrow test.That would also explain the digestive problems.The fatigue and digestion factors are all in line with it.For more information on it go to www.webmd.com and see if anything else looks familiar.Hope this helps and good luck.|`|al1pyamIaa	RED BULL<br>  <br>  actually dont drink redbull its bad.

p0Xw8hLZaa	Yes, eat a healthy breakfast, and add some fruit and drink milk, oj, or water with it.  It's also better to be active at night, not the morning, I don't exactly remember why but my dad told me and he's really into being physically fit.  I think it's because you will burn off the fat and calories you ate during the day.<br>  Eat the majority of food in the morning, and eat more small meals instead of only a few big meals a day.  Get enough aerobic exercise each day.  Drink lots of water!<br>  Good luck, and I hope I helped!!  Any other questions you can e-mail me!|`|IvDjOOXkaa	exercise can give your metabolism an immediate boost from the point your workout ends up to 3 hours post workout. a smaller boost continues to your metabolism approximately a day or so beyond this. this is why that exercise must be  routine to continually be effective.
p0Xw8hLZaa	Eat when you feel that you are hungry.  If you find something that looks really good (say cookies, ice cream, cupcakes, etc.) but you really aren't hungry, then don't eat it.  If you eat when your not hungry, you will just feel sick later, and maybe feel guilty for what you ate.  If you think you'll get hungry and not be able to eat when you are (say your in school or an event) then eat something small before it, like an apple or a banana.<br>  Hope I helped  =)|`|3je7nsJYaa	sounds good to me<br>  basically your body is telling you when to eat <br>  other wise your not really hungary

A9sLvVDxaa	autism or aspergers, in it's adult forms can be difficult to diagnose, because it is still a new condition within the mental health world.<br>  <br>  I know the symptoms, but I don't know the specific effects. I have adult autism, I do the counting, if you count things all the time, and it gets very distracting, or a song or word will get stuck in your head and it won't stop. Like fior the past hour I've had the Ode to Joy ringing in my head. If I don't focus on it, I can do other things, but even as I type this, I still hear it.<br>  <br>  Umm, repetitive actions or routines bring comfort. I like to plan things out, I don't do well with unpredictable situations. I like Ask Yahoo, because I can control how I interact with people. I like helping people, but on my own terms.<br>  <br>  It's hard for me to be social, I have lots of friends, but I don't socialize very often, I forget to call them or email. Sometimes I like to be alone, to seclude myself for weeks. <br>  <br>  I really don't like leaving the house unless I have to. I try to avoid people when I'm out in public and I don't like loud noises. A smoke detector going off drives me insane.<br>  <br>  I get into these rages over simple things.

So check in with another doctor, there are ways to get tested.
RXI8ImdIaa	There is no diagnostic test for Autism. If you want to be evaluated, you go to a psychiatrist who will ask about your symptoms.<br>  <br>  Clusters of specific symptoms lead to a diagnosis of autism, other symptoms lead to other diagnoses. It's probably difficult sometimes to get a really correct diagnosis, due to the nature of this sort of interviewing.<br>  <br>  If you think you have the wrong diagnosis or an incomplete diagnosis, go back to the psychiatrist. You should be having regular appointments anyway, right? <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that if you are truly schizophrenic, you may be predisposed to think that your doctors are wrong no matter what they tell you. In your situation I'd suggest getting a second opinion if you don't like the first one, however if multiple doctors tell you the same thing you need to trust them even if you don't believe it.|`|3MM64geHaa	There is not an "autism test."

A woman going through menopause needs 1000 mg to 1500 mg of calcium a day. And avoid excessive amounts of salt to reduce bloating associated with hormonal changes.

Let's face it, if someone is committing suicide then they probably didn't have a lot of people close to them in the first place. <br>  <br>  People will be sad sure, but their short period of sadness probably doesn't match the depression that the person committing suicide went through.

Many people say that the person who commits suicide is being selfish, but let's say that that person has constant pain, terminal illness, or mental illness.  Isn't it selfish of others to expect that person to be in constant physical or mental pain?|`|W5qZ1NKGaa	No, this is my opinion, because when you commit suicide you then put stress on everyone around you.

You can't lose fat in a specific area, the body just doesn't work that way.<br>  <br>  If you want to lose body fat, cut your calorie intake and do cardio for 30 minutes a day, at least 4 days a week.  <br>  <br>  I recommend cutting out all the sweet stuff, especially soda.  That way you're cutting the maximum number of calories in the smallest possible quantity of food.  You won't be as hungry.  <br>  <br>  Reducing your sugar intake is more effective than reducing fat intake because sweet foods generally have the highest concentration of calories per serving and not all fats are bad for you.  So if you absolutely have to have some McDonald's, go ahead and eat the fries, but skip the soda.|`|2owUaw1paa	turn into the hulk

bBBcbFmWaa	I have bipolar moods and took depakote, but it didn't help stabalize my moods. Depakote can have some tough side effects and if it isn't working, see if you can switch ASAP.  I gained a lot of weight and had some pretty big cognitive problems and was still unstable - talk about insult to injury! For some, depakote is an actual life saver and the tradeoff with the crappy side effects are worth it. My advice to you is let your body get used to it for a month or two. If you don't see improvement push hard to try something else.

Try jumping at least five times a week, 20 minutes a day to start.  Increase from there.  Work hard and vigorously.  If you're not sweating real good, you're not going hard enough.  Work at it!

vkE3qFSGaa	People have different opinions of what is virginity. Most people agree that the loss of virginity occurs when (in a woman) she has sex in the vagina. So, a tampon won't cause you to lose your virginity. <br>  If you mean breaking the hymen, tampons are generally small enough not to tear the hymen (hymens have  a small hole to allow for the discharge of menstrual blood). However, it is possible to tear or stretch it with a tampon. just not likely. Some girls are born without a hymen, and some lose them without sex, so it isn't a sure sign of virginity.|`|VUfT35UQaa	NO NO NO NO NO!<br>  <br>  YOu only lose your virginity if you have sex!

AA11286786	Whatever you weigh, that's what you weigh at the moment.  Your weight will fluctuate throughout the day. If you are weighing to track weight loss (or weight stability), just weigh the same time every day.  Without clothes, because different clothes weigh different amounts.  If you are weighing just to see the lowest number you can see to make you feel good somehow, weigh first thing in the morning after you go to the bathroom.

It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/reducebodyfat.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...</a>|`|AA11191856	The best thing you can do is eat healthy and eat often, but it has to be healthy food! You should be eating 5 times a day, 3 normal size meals, and small, healthy snacks in between meals.  Think of your body as a furnace, the more fuel you put in the fire to burn, the longer and hotter it will burn.  Same thing with your body and your metabolism, you have to constantly feed and stoke your fire so that your metabolism is constantly working to burn calories.  Also, you have to be working out, but most importantly doing alot of cardio work.  Running, biking, sports, anything that gets your heart up and keeps it up for a period of time is going to force your body to work, and your body runs by burning calories.  Now that your eating right and working out, lastly, you need to make sure that you are actually burning more calories than you take in on a daily basis.  If you take in 1500 calories daily, and burn 1800, your body is forced to find those 300 calories somewhere other than the food you are taking in, and they find those calories in the stored fat in your body.  Your body will break down the fat to use the calories stored in that fat, and you will ultimately lose weight!  You can focus your work out on certain parts of your body, but your body will lose weight from all over your body, so it can be difficult to focus on one specific area.  The best thing you can do is do alot of ab work that focuses on your obliques, which are the abs on the side of your torso.  You can do side bends, twist crunches, or plank exercises, and that will help to tone the area around your 'love handles'!

Do as many as you can, rest for two minutes, then do as many as you can again, even if that is just 2 or 3.  Doing lots of pushups will also help you lose weight.  Good luck!|`|BQQ5fAXtaa	dips and pull ups....<br>  <br>  begin with three sets of as many reps on dip bars then six sets of max reps push ups...<br>  <br>  that's the easiest way in my experience to build reps....<br>  <br>  but don't forget cardio and ab workouts...<br>  thirty to forty minuets running and 150-200 sit ups every other day<br>  <br>  the best way to loose Weight is to swim.....

I mean you don't have it at all. why are you so worried about it? yes diabetes can be hereditary, but your only 180lbs at 6'1, and it's apparently not caused by diabetes because you don't have it yet. so your weight suggests a very low chance of getting it.<br>  <br>  there's nothing wrong with eatting bread. if you really really wanna try something different, go chinese, try panda express or something, they have those chow mein and fried rice stuff that completely rule out bread. we all know the chinese is thin and they don't eat bread. so yea that might be an option for you if your really that trying to avoid bread.|`|68edad4826bc75b2b9f39ed5a85d8cf5aa	A person your age needs carbs to grow and get energy.<br>   Go to another doctor.<br>  <br>  He never said you have diabetes.Try an endocrinologist.|`|AA11707529	I suggest you do an online search of "adult diabetes" and take it from there.

Good things to eat, salads/veggies, chicken, cheese, lean red meats, good oils like olive oil and fish oil.  per your doctors instructions you need to drop the pasta, bread and mostly those soft pretzels.  As I said in my other answer your doctor needs to do an OGTT because with the results you have gotten so far you are not considered diabetic, a high A1c is not part of the diagnosis criteria.  Before a major change in your diet he should run more tests.  This will also be good because then you will know what is going on.|`|e0d08c2181048633322f70afd6634965aa	The trick is to eat everything in moderation. Eat bread but only 2 slices a day. Have pasta, but only twice a week. On the other nights have two with meat and 2 with fish and then do whatever with the other one. Make sure and have a full protein intake of 45g per day, this can be made up with glasses of milk if you don't get enough through the meat or fish you are eating. <br>  <br>  Then exercise. At least half and hour a day but try to do a hour as that is the recommended amount. And make sure and drink plenty of water, 8 glasses a day. That'll help with digestion and shizz.

Some of the other uses include, cross-eyes (yes really), uncontrollable blinking, Cervical dystonia, moderate to severe wrinkles, frown lines and crows feet. It generally lasts 4-6months. The cost of botox varies depending on the area being treated and the amount of botox needed. See a licensed botox professional and they will be able to tell you how much it will cost you.|`|AA12266052	Botulinum toxin type A injection (Botox) is used to relieve the symptoms of cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis; uncontrollable tightening of the neck muscles that may cause neck pain and abnormal head positions), strabismus (an eye muscle problem that causes the eyes to turn inward or outward), and blepharospasm (uncontrollable tightening of the eyelid muscles that may cause blinking, squinting, and abnormal eyelid movements). Botulinum toxin type A injection (Botox) is also used to control severe underarm sweating that cannot be treated with products that are applied to the skin. Botulinum toxin type A injection (Botox Cosmetic) is used to temporarily smooth frown lines (wrinkles between the eyebrows). Botulinum toxin type A is in a class of medications called neurotoxins. When botulinum toxin type A is injected into a muscle, it blocks the nerve signals that cause uncontrollable tightening and movements of the muscle. When botulinum toxin type A is injected into a sweat gland, it decreases the activity of the gland to reduce sweating.<br>  Botulinum toxin type B is used to relieve the symptoms of cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis; uncontrollable tightening of the neck muscles that may cause neck pain and abnormal head positions).

UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/reducebodyfat.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...</a>|`|MF9YknDYaa	No|`|wGTisY1aaa	You cannot just do sit-ups to help get rid of love handles or make your stomach flat, and you cannot get thinner thighs by just doing workouts for your thighs. If you were to look at a muscle anatomy picture, you will find that what we call love handles are simply our gluteus medius which goes up and connects to the external obliques and goes down to and forms the gluteus maximus which is connected to your lats. Doing the following will help with the entire area to tighten and tone up your muscles and help burn the fat around them. Hope all of this helps do lunges, step-up kickbacks, walking downhill, running, leg raises without weight or very light weight, yoga, push ups, lat pull downs, pull ups rowing, and deadlifts. All of this combined with a proper diet full of lean protein and carbs, and you should be in business. If you need anymore help email me.

I take Sundays off to rest and relax. Push pull for example is doing triceps extension with or without a break then doing biceps curls and adding reverse or regular crunches in there to make sure I get abs in and it cuts down on time. I do abs a lot to keep my core strong. I try to get all of the muscles in that area to work together on the same day. Do the amount of weight for what you want to accomplish. Say for toning, lightweight and high reps (15-20) and 3-4 sets. To build muscle, 2-3 sets and 10-12 reps. All beginners need to start with 1-2 sets and 8-10 reps with lightweights. Remember to stretch after your workout to keep from cramping up.10-15 minutes of stretching is optimal.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.

dJuEtGxraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|wOcJ60Jxaa	at this point please what ever you do go slow. you can really hurt your self. i am someone who has weight lifted for 4 years now and trust me going slow is the only way. you are a little to young to weight lift so my best suggestion is to run in moderation and do sit up and push up pull up etc. do not starve yourself but do not over eat. again slow and steady don't expect results right away because trust me they probably will not be there. it takes work and time/patience. everyone is different good luck|`|M1vvXIdvaa	Eat healthy and boost your exercise.

AA11048920	The vast majority of us who have MS live a relatively normal life. I have had MS for 20 years. I work, own a home, have an advanced degree, visit the gym at least four times a week and enjoy my social life. Most of us get the relapsing/remitting form of the disease, meaning that the disease comes and goes. <br>  <br>  While medical research does not know for a fact what happens to those of us with this disease, they theorize that the immune system begans to attack the coating on the nerves which is called myelin. Consequently, the messages between the body and the brain get interrupted. This can effect just about every body function with the exception of the major organs. Hence, the disease is not fatal. <br>  <br>  MS can effect swallowing, talkiing, walking, standing, hearing, balance, and seeing as well as other motor activities. Since the nervous system is also involved in cognition, decision making and short term memory can also suffer. Lastly, MS can effect the emotions. No person ever gets all the symptoms. There are 50 in all. <br>  The most common complaint of people with MS is fatigue, tingling in the extremities and numbness.<br>  <br>  Modern medicine has an arsenal of weapons to use against MS. Some drugs either stop or halt the progression of the disease and others are used to treat the symptoms. There are also quite a number of exceptionally promising  pharmaceuticals on the horizon. While the progressive form of the disease is devstating, those cases are the exception not the rule. The truth is that there is plenty of life after a diagnosis of MS.|`|Sofk2yO8aa	check wikipedia|`|SQLSOeHcaa	<a href="http://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/guide/multiple-sclerosis-causes" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.msactivesource.com/msavProject/msas.portal/_baseurl/twoColLayout/SCSRepository/en_US/msas/home/What-Is-Multiple-Sclerosis/causes-multiple-sclerosis.xml" rel="nofollow">http://www.msactivesource.com/msavProjec...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  "Multiple sclerosis represents a disorder of the central nervous system and implies the interruption of the communication between the brain and the other parts of the body. It is a chronic, unpredictable and autoimmune disease that evolves from an initial benign state to a disabling and devastating condition. The assumption of auto immunity – process that implies the attack of the immune system against the body's own healthy tissues as if they were damaging external agents – comes from the assault of the organism over the nerve – insulating myelin. <br>  <br>  This terrible disease attacks over one million people around the world and it two times more frequent in women than in men. The majority of people are affected between the ages between 20 and 40 by the symptoms. The first symptom is represented by blurred or double vision, the distortion of red and green color or in some cases blindness of one eye may occur. Then, the extremities of the muscles are weakened, which generates muscular coordination and balance problems. For the affected people, both motion and standing become real problems. The most severe situations imply partial or complete paralysis. <br>  <br>  Other possible symptoms may be represented by paresthesias, sensorial abnormalities such as prickling, numbness, difficulties of speech, tremors, dizziness, hearing loss or even pain and depression. <br>  <br>  50% of the affected people also face cognitive disturbance as a hard time to focus, to pay attention, to remember things. These symptoms are usually neglected because they are rarely severe. <br>  <br>  Multiple sclerosis implies an incorrect attack of the antibodies and leucocytes against the proteins contained in the myelin sheath that goes around the brain and spinal cord. This attack generates inflammation of the sheath and in time, of the nerves and it results in multiple scaring surfaces (sclerosis). The harm is enormous: the signals emitted by the brain to control the muscle strength, sensations and visions are now slow or blocked"<br>  <br>  **************************************... <br>  <br>  The proper time to address a doctor

q40toPNOaa	I have very poor vision and have been wearing glasses since first grade. I got contacts in fifth grade and I love them.  At first, when you are being taught how to put them in you might be like ugh, this is ridiculous, I'm not getting these...but I put my contacts in my eyes in about 30 seconds every morning. They never hurt. However, they do bother me sometimes. For example, if it's really dry out or if the heat is on really high my eyes kind of get irritated, but it doesn't hurt though, it's just annoying. But this only happens like a few times a year if that.  I do wear my glasses at night though.  When I do sports, I never wear my glasses just because I have never been comfortable. But everybody is different. It really depends on you and what you are comfortable wearing. And btw, I have never heard of contacts causing blindness.  Think about what would be better for YOU to use.  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped you! <br>  Good Luck!<br>  =)|`|XwV1bar5aa	contacts don't hurt at all they may sting a little when you put them in but blink hard and you won't feel them, the only time they really hurt is if you were to put them on inside out but i doubt you'll do that. and i believe what whoever told you about the blindness meant is that in time your vision will worsen with contacts but it'll do that with glasses too so uhh yeah...get contacts|`|SONPeyAqaa	I had glasses for a long time and then got contacts they took me awhile to get use to but i love them now!!!!!!|`|SAGnmOAKaa	id say glasses they are more convenient^^

UBxylFAuaa	Hi :) <br>  <br>  I had the same exact problem when I first started my period. Sometimes it takes a while for your body to adjust to the hormonal changes your body is going through. <br>  <br>  What helped me regulate my cycle was birth control pills.

It helps regulate periods, alleviate cramps, prevent cysts, and helps prevent pregnancy as well. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps you :) good luck!!|`|vkE3qFSGaa	It's because you're a young girl so your hormones are changing and hormones control your periods.

It causes recurrent headaches and sometimes other neurological symptoms, such as numbness, tingling or weakness on one side of the body. The first sign of a migraine may be an "aura," or a premonition that an attack is imminent. There may be visual disturbance, such as bright spots or zigzag lines before both eyes.    The typical migraine headache is unilateral and pulsating, lasting from 4 to 72 hours; symptoms include nausea, vomiting, photophobia (increased sensitivity to bright light), and hyperacusis (increased sensitivity to noise); approximately one third of people who suffer migraine headache perceive an aura   visual, olfactory   announcing the headache. The aura is caused by temporary narrowing of the blood vessels supplying part of the brain. Minutes later, when the blood vessels, which had been tightly constricted, suddenly open up to allow a gush of blood to the brain, a severe, one sided, throbbing headache follows, often with an aversion to light, and vomiting. Symptoms may last from a few hours to several days.  However, not all migraines follow the same pattern and in some cases only the headache occurs. This can make it difficult to cure a migraine headache. Typically, migraine occurs after, rather than during, times of stress for example, after an examination or important interview. It may also be related to sensitivity to certain foods. Women are prone to migraine during menstrual periods. The oral contraceptive pill can also cause migraines particularly during the pill-free week.  What the Natural Doctor Recommends for a natural migraine headache cure:  Acupuncture, especially when combined with aromatherapy.  Be sure to have your treatment in a darkened room as the migraine headache can cause light sensitivity.  Practitioners ascribe migraines to a blockage of Qi energy in the yang channels of the head. Individual treatment depends upon the location of the pain, but the stomach and the large and small intestine meridians would probably be treated.  Reflexology Massage is given to the reflex areas relating to the head, and to the spine, eyes, sinuses, pituitary, thyroid and reproductive glands, the digestive system, liver and solar plexus.  These are just a few ways of handling migraine pain management and getting the relief you need. Here are some more options to getting rid of your migraine pain.  analgesics for the head-ache, an anti-emetic for the nausea, and the avoidance of triggering conditions. The cause of migraine headache is unknown; the accepted theory is a disorder of the serotonergic control system, as PET scan has demonstrated the aura coincides with diffusion of cortical depression consequent to increased blood flow (up to 300% greater than baseline). There are migraine headache variants, some originate in the brainstem (featuring intercellular transport dysfunction of calcium and potassium ions) and some are genetically disposed.  Studies of twins indicate a 60 to 65 per cent genetic influence upon their developing propensity to migraine headache. Moreover, fluctuating hormone levels indicate a migraine relation: 75 percent of adult patients are women, although migraine affects approximately equal numbers of prepubescent boys and girls; propensity to migraine headache is known to disappear during pregnancy.|`|lhpatvLjaa	You shouldn't be "suffering" from bi-polar disease, you might just be feeling depressed, which is perfectly normal.  Last weekend, I was going through the same thing where I was dizzy when i got up, you might just be exhausted, and the headaches on the other hand may just be from dehydration, or a lack of essantial nutrients in your diet.  The same thing happens to me where i get migranes and my body feels cold and gets goosebumps, I just drink water because I'm dehydratd, it sometime helps if you throw up, but don't go anorexic.  Hope this helps. (:

6uYVRaebaa	Headache with nausea is the most common complication; it often responds to analgesics and infusion of fluids and can often be prevented by strict maintenance of a supine posture for two hours after the successful puncture. Merritt's Neurology (10th edition), in the section on lumbar puncture, notes that intravenous caffeine injection is often quite effective in aborting these so-called "spinal headaches." Contact between the side of the lumbar puncture needle and a spinal nerve root can result in anomalous sensations (paresthesia) in a leg during the procedure; this is harmless and patients can be warned about it in advance to minimize their anxiety if it should occur. A headache that is persistent despite a long period of bedrest and occurs only when sitting up may be indicative of a CSF leak from the lumbar puncture site. It can be treated by more bedrest, or by an epidural blood patch, where the patient's own blood is injected back into the site of leakage to cause a clot to form and seal off the leak.<br>  <br>  Serious complications of a properly performed lumbar puncture are extremely rare. They include spinal or epidural bleeding, and trauma to the spinal cord or spinal nerve roots resulting in weakness or loss of sensation, or even paraplegia. The latter is exceedingly rare, since the level at which the spinal cord ends (normally the inferior border of L1, although it is slightly lower in infants) is several vertebral spaces above the proper location for a lumbar puncture (L3/L4). There are case reports of lumbar puncture resulting in perforation of abnormal dural arterio-venous malformations, resulting in catastrophic epidural hemorrhage; this is exceedingly rare.<br>  <br>  The procedure is not recommended when epidural infection is present or suspected, when topical infections or dermatological conditions pose a risk of infection at the puncture site or in patients with severe psychosis or neurosis with back pain. Some authorities believe that withdrawal of fluid when initial pressures are abnormal could result in spinal cord compression or cerebral herniation; others believe that such events are merely coincidental in time, occurring independently as a result of the same pathology that the lumbar puncture was performed to diagnose. In any case, computed tomography of the brain is often performed prior to lumbar puncture if an intracranial mass is suspected.<br>  <br>  Removal of cerebrospinal fluid resulting in reduced fluid pressure has been shown to correlate with greater reduction of cerebral blood flow among patients with Alzheimer's disease. Its clinical significance is uncertain.<br>  <br>  Im pretty sure that your pain isn't linked to your spinal tap though so I would recommend a doctor :) or at least an ER visit
AA10169678	Taking an SSRI (Zoloft, or its generic equivalent setraline) can induce mania in patients with bipolar disorder.<br>  You are cycling and should see a psychiatrist IMMEDIATELY before the manic symptoms get out of control. <br>  Any psychiatrist would know to put you on a mood stabilizer to even out the effects the sertraline is having.<br>  Learning to "control" bipolar disorder depends heavily on the type (bipolar 1, or bipolar 2) and the severity level. I have friends who have bipolar 2 and have managed well without medication for many years. On the other hand, I and several others I know who have bipolar 1 MUST take medication every day to keep the symptoms and our lives under control and to avoid psychiatric hospitalizations (or worse).<br>  Combination treatment (meds and cognitive-behavioral therapy) has been shown through legitimate research to be the most effective in the management of mood disorders.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	You need to work with your psychiatrist on this, because everyone's situation varies so much.  It isn't normal for someone with bipolar to be on an antidepressant without a mood stabilizer such as lithium, depakote, or lamictal on board also.  It is almost malpractice to give someone with bipolar an antidepressant in this manner (unless your case is an exception for some reason, like you can't tolerate those drugs, they didn't work, etc).  You need to see a PSYCHIATRIST not a family doc.  You need a mood stabilizer, that is the problem. You lose the manias with a mood stabilizer, but you will still have happy days etc. - if the drug leaves you too flat, the dose is too high, or sometimes you just can't take that drug & need to try another. <br>  <br>  I trashed my life when I was misdiagnosed with depression & given antidepressants. I went bankrupt, did computer & phone sex when I was married, etc.  Really bad.  This is common for severe mania, which the antidepressant has a good chance of doing that to you. You may even break the law if it gets bad enough.  You need to get on a mood stabilizer right away. Call up your doc monday morning, and have him/her call a prescription into the pharmacy right away.<br>  <br>  PS Most people with bipolar who think they are keeping it under control without medication "lack insight." They think they are fine, and their relatives are BEGGING them to go back on meds. Those who make it without meds are the ones with the MILDEST cases, who have very few relapses in their lives (some people only have a couple episodes ever).  I would take what people say with a grain of salt. I have run across many folks with bipolar who say they are fine when they are off meds, but they have loads of self-destructive behaviors that are clearly caused by bipolar. I even see this when they are forced into the hospital!  They are still saying they are fine, and they are having sex with strangers etc. & they are married!

LKqbrHNnaa	This is something only you can answer for yourself my dear, we can't possibly know how you feel about this or what your circumstances are.<br>  <br>  You say you feel ready but if you could read your question in another person's shoes, you would agree that you are actually far, far from ready.<br>  I was ready for my first time - 16, was with my boyfriend for over a year, used protection, did it in my house in a bed - and I STILL regret it. I wondered what all the fuss was about!<br>  My point is though, that I knew I was ready because I had no doubts, I just knew what I wanted to do and how to do it. I didn't need to ask anyone any questions or felt any pressure.<br>  <br>  My advice is - wait until you are mature, at the legal age, and with someone you can trust 100%.

But before you get to that point, ask your doctor for a referral to a specialist in knee problems.

The largest and most complicated joint, the knee is used for everything from standing up, sitting, to walking, running, etc. It's a weight-bearing joint that straightens, bends, twists and rotates. All this motion increases your risk of acute or overuse knee injuries.<br>  <br>  Acute knee injuries (including torn ligaments and torn cartilage) are often caused by twisting the knee or falling. Sports that involve running and jumping and sudden stopping and turning, such as soccer, basketball, volleyball, tennis, and baseball, as well as contact sports such as football, wrestling, and hockey increase the risk of an acute knee injury.<br>  <br>  But more common than sudden knee injuries are injuries caused by overuse or overload. <br>  <br>  Overuse knee injuries (including muscle strain, tendonitis and bursitis) may develop gradually over days or weeks. Pain is often mild and intermittent in the beginning and worsens over time. When muscles and tendons are stressed even slightly beyond their capabilities, microscopic tears occur. (Inflammation, which is part of the healing process, is what causes the pain). These tears must be given a chance to heal before subjected to the same activity to avoid overuse injury. Treat overuse injuries early to prevent chronic problems.<br>  <br>  Knee pain is commonly caused by doing too much too soon when you haven't exercised for a long period of time - especially high-impact aerobics; walking, running or jumping on hard surfaces or uneven ground; excessive running up and down stairs (When you walk upstairs you are putting pressure on your knees that is equivalent to four times your body weight, when running up the stairs it can be eight times your body weight). <br>  <br>  Knee osteoarthritis is a common cause of knee pain. The risk increases with age. Osteoarthritis is a form of arthritis involving degeneration of the cartilage. Exercise is vital to maintain strength and flexibility of muscles supporting the knee, which reduces the stress on the knee joint.<br>  <br>  People with knee osteoarthritis may also need to take pain medications and/or other complementary pain treatments.<br>  <br>  Runners knee (also called patellofemoral pain or anterior knee pain) is a common cause of knee pain in young people (not just in runners). The pain is usually diffuse pain behind the kneecap. Symptoms often worsen after climbing stairs, jumping, running, or after a period of sitting. Caused by poor tracking of the kneecap, appropriate exercises prescribed by a doctor or physical therapist is the main treatment in correcting runners knee. Stay away from high-impact activity if you have this condition.<br>  <br>  Prevent knee pain by keeping the muscles that support your knees strong and flexible. Start out slowly. Walk before you run - before you engage in a strenuous high impact activity such as jogging or running, try walking for a week. If walking causes knee pain, you shouldn't be running. Warm up and stretch before working out. Give your body a chance to recover from exercise. If you do high impact activities take every other day off. Avoid running up and down stairs and full squats. Doing knee exercises to strengthen and stretch the muscles that support the knee are vital for knee pain and injury prevention. Proper footwear is also important, especially if walking or running on hard surfaces. Keep your weight under control. Reducing one's weight reduces stress upon the knee.<br>  <br>  Most knee pain is treated conservatively, but there are situations in which surgery is required. Athletes are at an elevated risk for sudden injuries that may require surgery, such as torn ligaments in the center of the knee or certain types of fractures. People with advanced knee osteoarthritis may need knee replacement surgery if they are severely limited in day-to- day activities because of their condition. This is optional surgery and is a last resort. <br>  <br>  Most knee conditions respond to a combination of non-invasive treatments such as applying heat or cold, temporarily restraining from activities that aggravate pain, and medications that target pain and inflammation. Exercises to strengthen the muscles that support the knee help reduce stress on the knee joint and prevent re-injury". <br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  <br>  *Always get a proper diagnosis from a qualified medical professional*

Especially dangerous side effects include vomiting, loss of appetite, fever, or dark urine. These suggest a possibility of liver damage. People taking this drug should also call their doctor if they experience other serious side effects. Some serious side effects are unusual bleeding (especially in the urine), hallucinations, and complete drowsiness. Some people also experience constipation or diarrhea from use of this drug. 1% to 10% of people report weight gain and increased appetite. The same percentage also reports abnormal dreams.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|dJuEtGxraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ?

Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|yxRGDjs2aa	Hi in 8 weeks you can certainly do a lot.<br>  I am a UK personal Trainer, I will if you want, provide you with a full programme to loose weight in the fastest possible time, to get the best possible results, in the safest possible way.<br>  I won't be actually working with you so don't worry no charge, just happy to help. get back to me, we will take it from there.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  take a look at my web site www.srpersonaltraining.co.uk|`|3je7nsJYaa	yes ok this might sound mad but read carefully, this WILL work if you do it and remeber its not forever.<br>  1. get off your computer now, go for a run, walk, bike ride, swim or jump about for 1 hour<br>  2. stop eating now see how long you can go without eating<br>  3. cut out the snacks<br>  4. reduce portion sizes<br>  5. if cant resist temtation to snack eat fruit or veg<br>  6. drink lots of water<br>  7. do this untill you lose a bit then STOP, dont go over the top and lose loads<br>  good luck|`|zNn9VfRyaa	to lose weight u need to eat right and have a workout plan 5-6 days a week.u have to want it. <br>  ***try this u need to change ur diet. <br>  eat six times a day. ea of ur 3 main meals needs to combine a lean protein such as chicken breast ground turkey turkey bacon egg whts also combine that with a complex carb such as a baked potato or sweet potato wild rice brown rice oatmeal or girts. also add fresh fruit and vegies to lunch and dinner. pick fruits low in sugar like pears and berries. if u get canned vegies get ones with low sodium. eat every 3-4 hrs keep ur metablism moving.<br>  ***also the most important part is WATER drink at least 64oz. no soda or juice. water will curve ur cravings. <br>  u need to hit cardio 3-4 times a week running outside it great workout if u can hit a gym and cardio machine is great at least 30mins***<br>  also add weight/strength training 3 times a week.u can google free weight traning guides anywhere. its not hard to find things for free.<br>  ***plan ur meals ahead of time.always have a healthy snack with u so u wont be tempted to eat fast food. also if u wait to late to eat u will get so hungry u will eat the world. make time to work out start out with 30 mins then increase.its ur body treat it right. ur diet alone can help lose weight but working out makes ur body look good. shows muscles and tight skin which is sexy and beautful. stick with it ur body will amaze u!!! to be healthy and look great u need both in ur life. good luck email me if u have further questions|`|hZ9m6ekEaa	i think runnings meant to be best sport for weight loss|`|YCxZQfI3aa	replace all ur liquid intake with only water

Dreaming is very important, it is the deep sleep that helps regulate our bodies.

It is not a stand alone diagnosis or disease. By definition, insomnia is "difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or both" and it may be due to inadequate quality or quantity of sleep. It is typically followed by functional impairment while awake. Insomniacs have been known to complain about being unable to close their eyes or "rest their mind" for more than a few minutes at a time. Both organic and non-organic insomnia constitute a sleep disorder. Here is more information that might help. Exercise may help too.

The first time I had sex (it was not with my current boyfriend) it hurt so extremely bad as well that I had to tell him to stop. He didn't even penetrate me all the way, that's how bad it hurt.

TsjqzanQaa	I've been using the TLC Tugger for two years, and have achieved great results.<br>  <br>  While I lost more than the usual amount of sexual sensitivity because of the mutilation of circumcision, I had a small amount of loose skin, so I could start restoration with a device right away, once I found out about it.<br>  <br>  Others, who were cut more tightly will require some taping restoration methods first, to grow enough skin for a device to "grab onto."<br>  <br>  While there are a lot of devices, I researched it and found that the TLC Tugger is the best for the money, and is the most popular, as such.<br>  <br>  About 200,000 guys are restoring their foreskins.    It isn't easy, nor is it fast, but the end results are worth it, a more natural feeling during sexual activity and a more natural look, also.<br>  <br>  If you have enough skin left on your penis to pull some up when flaccid over the edge of the glans, then you may be able to use a device.<br>  <br>  There are also a lot of support groups and sites for those of us restoring.       A lot of guys are finally waking up to the fact that the best part of the sexual experience was stolen from them along with their foreskins.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|K4zsztkRaa	No it's not a good way to START if you don't already have a very good amount of skin. The best ways to start and mannual tugging and taping methods. I know a lot of guys rave about T-tape. I never liked it. I wear the leg strag that looks like the one from the TLC tugger and I clip it to some tape that is attached to my shaft skin. <br>  It works very well.<br>  <br>  I would exsperiment with some tape, and mannual stretching before doing to a device. A device like that isn't the best idea when you are just starting out because you might not have enough skin for it to be comfortable. <br>  Try cross taping, there you cross tape your skin over your head all day. <br>  <br>  www.restoreforeskin.org is a great site with a bunch of guys who are restoring or who have restored. There is a forum with pictures and how to videos and you can post questions or concerns. It's a great site that has helped me a lot.<br>  <br>  You want to find some buddies to help you with this journy. Honestly it's tough and takes a lot of determination and it's nice to have friends that will help keep you on track because you might need them. Just stick to it once you start and you'll do no wrong.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also the problem with starting out with a device right away is that if you have to force your skin into it and it's painful then you are hurting your skin cells and they won't grow. So you'd be wasting your time. Also what can happen is that your shaft skin tugs on your scrotal skin and the tension is really tugging on your scrotum and that's the skin that's going to grow. I see a lot of restored men who now have scrotal skin going up into the bottom of thei shaft cause they put the tension in the wrong place. So just be careful about that aswell.<br>  <br>  If you have any questions fill free to email me off my profile. I'm up to helping anyone I can with this.<br>  <br>  Goodluck and welcome to the foreskin restorers club. lol<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|CNW6eAjoaa	I have a variety of devices that I use regularly.  I like the TLC because of the simplicity.  It is one of the 'tape less methods'  Some people (like myself) prefer tape on devices, and others prefer not to have to deal with tape.  It also depends on your lifestyle.  Are you at the gym a lot where it is better to have a tape less device you can remove quickly?  Tape is easily and painlessly removed under warm shower water.<br>  Lots of guys start out with manual foreskin stretches to get them a bit of looseness, and then spend a bit of time taping for coverage and some passive stretch. Google this and you will find information on stretches.  You should experiment a bit and find out what will work for you.<br>  Congratulations, by the way, on starting out restoring.  It is the best thing I have ever done for myself.<br>  Just do a lot of reading on the internet and select a device that you think will work for you.  Remember, this is a time commitment and too much tension will not fast track your restoration.  It will end up tearing the sensitive skin, and slowing down the restoration.  <br>  Good luck with this.  I see a few fellow restorers have already responded, so you have some good sources of information.<br>  Please feel free to write to me through this site if you have more restoration questions.  I am very motivated to offer support and encouragement to others for this worthwhile effort.  I cannot tell you how much good it has done for me, on many different levels.|`|AA11170501	don't bother i got cut at 18 for medical reasons and ended up with all the same old problems.<br>  i have just been re-cut to sort my self out<br>  <br>  as for loosing any feeling you don't i dident|`|23HS8B9waa	i can imagine why.. it is the best,<br>  i dunno what to say really, just go to a specialist for this type of thing, after all it's such a delicate matter..|`|Pm9Q3yM7aa	I believe it is, ive looked into many options and i ended up getting a tugger|`|dM9pHrQIaa	Depends on how much skin you have left.  The TLC requires a decent bit of skin to work properly, but you can use some different tape methods and just manual stretching (pulling on your skin a few times a day for like 10-15 second periods, 3-5 times in a row) to get yourself started.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.restoreforeskin.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.restoreforeskin.org</a> has a lot of information from other users of all kinds of devices and<br>  <a href="http://www.foreskin-restoration.net/forums" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreskin-restoration.net/foru...</a>  -- you can read up on all the devices on those forums<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!

Do some squats or try jogging a little. I jog for about 45 mins a day sometimes. You dont have to run fast, jogging shows results fast..as long as you stick to it.

It's the ultimate lift, look up the propper form and technique and find a routine that challenges you.

87756LlTaa	The increased sensitivity is caused by minor damage to nerves.  This usually goes away when a person uses a recommended dose of the drug in the strip.  If you use too much, you can cause permanent damage to the nerve, the sensitivity can be permanent.  Nerve damage in teeth can also lead to eventual tooth breakage, permanent (bad) discoloration, and tooth loss.  <br>  <br>  If you want really white teeth, see your dentist.  There are stronger formulas that are more safe and will get your teeth really white.  It costs a little more, but the whitening effect lasts longer.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.

I use inversion therapy which is hanging upside down and using the effects of your own weight to stretch out the muscles of you back, hips, thighs, abs and legs.  When these muscles get damaged and knotted up they can cause painful sciatica, bulging discs can result, and other painful problems like you are feeling right now.  Teeter hang ups make a great inversion rack that comes with gravity boots and a door way mounted bar.  You can hang up side down whenever you like if you have one at home and each session is kinda like giving yourself a massage by gravity.  It has made all the difference in my life and has taught me that I can fix my sciatica and muscle tightness by myself with out having to pay a massage therapist.  If you're back is really hurting inversion therapy will totally help you.  You can google: online health inversion therapy and read some good info. there.  Hope this helps.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	Yes I do

b8a51f5098090ab33a464a74631f3bd9aa	Oh yeah... worrying too much leads to stress. Stress not only affects how your body performs and feels but it will also affect your sexual performance and it's all because of how your body is reacting to the stress. Stress will affect us mentally, emotionally, physically and at times spiritually. So if you stop and think about what all is being affected when you stress, it's kinda scary and leads to some illnesses. Your sexual performance will not be at it's best if your body is ill, weak, worn out, etc.  When a guy is very stressed out, he'll be lucky to get it up and even then, more than likely he will not perform at top peak or last as long as he used to and should.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Yes it can.<br>  <br>  Stress and depression can also cause impotence, or any number of sexual performance problems.

ULTRJJ6waa	Hi. When i had frozen shoulder, i went to a physical therapist who showed me the right exercises to do everyday. I didn't have insurance, so i only went once just to get the list of exercises so i could do them at home. It is important to do the right kind of movements or you can make your shoulder worse. There was about eight of them i had to do everyday, and they helped the pain somewhat ( not as much as i would have liked them to ). You can find some of them on the net also. I just went to a therapist to make sure i was taught how to do them the right way. From experience, i can tell you that only time can heal a frozen shoulder. Mine took about a year to stop hurting, and another 8 months before i could lift my arm all the way up again. Best of luck to you. Feel better soon :-)
XBy7am73aa	You can catch an STD at anytime, period or not. The silent STD for women is Chlymidia which is rife among young people and can affect fertitlity issues.  If shes that worried you can buy STD testing kits or most hospitals have GU clinic where you can go in confidence and have the tests done.  If you have both had or even one of you has had unprotected sex with another person an STD is a possibility. Having sex unprotected when she is not on a period is dangerous, if you worried about STD's you need to wear a condom every single time. STD's can be easily treated if caught early but for her peace of mind I would both get tested and dont worry you are 2 of thousands of people who have same concerns,|`|mIC6zebSaa	why in this day and age would anyone have unprotected sex. are you not worried about her getting pregnant!!!!|`|R7mnEUOZaa	You should be more worried about her being pregnant if you are having unprotected sex.If neither of you have an STD then neither of you can get one this way|`|wjGj6uU3aa	the question is why is she so worries now that you will catch an STI has she been cheating? does she know something you dont?<br>  if You have been having unprotected sex alot then yeah i would be more worried if she gets pregnant.<br>  but if none of you have STIs including slient STIs like chlamydia or HPV then no you cant catch anything.
AA11020187	Sure a CT can show all of those things on starlight’s list, but what does it have to do with your grandfather? None of them explain the findings.<br>  <br>  It’s hard to answer your question without knowing what was found and that comes from the report. “Abnormal” doesn’t indicate anything but more tests. When was your grandfather’s last colonoscopy? Was it normal? What symptoms lead to his having the CT? Did he have any lab work? Has he had any surgeries in the past? These are other things that need to be answered in order to give you a meaningful answer.<br>  <br>  It is possible the findings in the colon and the liver are independent and not very serious, but colon cancer often presents this way.

I have been hoping and praying everyday for someone to come up with that cure for the past 2 years. <br>  <br>  There are four different grades of brain cancer:<br>  <br>  Grade I- The tumor grows slowly, has cells that look similar to normal cells, and rarely spreads into nearby tissues. It may be possible to remove the entire tumor by surgery. Treatment may be needed. Responds to treatment and cancer usually goes into remission<br>  <br>  Grade II- The tumor grows slowly, but may spread into nearby tissue and may become a higher-grade tumor. Usually responds to treatment when caught in this early stage.<br>  <br>  Grade III- The tumor grows quickly, is likely to spread into nearby tissue, and the tumor cells look very different from normal cells. Possible response to treatment.<br>  <br>  Grade IV- The tumor grows very aggressively, has cells that look very different from normal cells, and ususally does not repond to any type of treatments.<br>  <br>  The chance of recovery (prognosis) and choice of treatment depend on the type, grade, and location of the tumor and whether cancer cells remain after surgery and/or have spread to other parts of the brain.<br>  <br>  My husband has Grade IV Brain Cancer "Glioblastoma" and we have been battling this cancer for the last 26 months....every single day. My husband was originally diagnoised with a Stage II Gangliomaglioma, however within 5 months it developed into Grade IV. It only took 5 months to go from "curable" to "terminal".<br>  <br>  Don't waste to much time thinking, and trying to figure things out. Get yourself or whoever your question is for, in to see a Neurosurgeon right away. Make sure you do your own research on the doctor's you choose, and don't be afraid to speak your opinion with your doctors. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you! Always remember one thing...your mind is a powerful thing. Always stay positive, no matter how hard it gets. Negativity will only slow you down, and make it hard to recover.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best!|`|bdN3sTBxaa	My mothers oncologist does not say that the cancer is "curable" but rather that it has gone into remission.  That bothered me for a long time until I began to understand what she meant.  Since the doctors do not know what caused the cancer in the first place, it is not possible to say it is "cured",  they can only say it isn't there now.  <br>  <br>  MANY people who have had cancer of the brain have gone on to live a completely full life, dying at an old age of things that have nothing to do with cancer of any kind.  As with any part of the body, "brain" cancer merely tells where the cancer is, not what kind it is, how large it is, etc.  <br>  <br>  Your doctor (or the doctor of the person with cancer of the brain) is the one that can give the best answers about the current state of the patient.  It is much better for the patient and the family/friends to ask the doctor all questions rather than to "fret" about it.  Worrying not only doesn't help, but it delays recovery.  <br>  <br>  As with all people with cancer, I pray that it is and remains in full remission!|`|SQLSOeHcaa	No one knows the exact cause of primary brain cancer. One possibility is that as the brain and spinal cord were forming, a problem with the cells occurred.<br>  <br>  Treatments vary depending upon the type and location of the tumor.

Some patients receive chemotherapy as well.<br>  <br>  The chance of surviving a brain tumor depends on its type, location, and treatment.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/reducebodyfat.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...</a>|`|wGTisY1aaa	You cannot just do sit-ups to help get rid of love handles or make your stomach flat, and you cannot get thinner thighs by just doing workouts for your thighs. If you were to look at a muscle anatomy picture, you will find that what we call love handles are simply our gluteus medius which goes up and connects to the external obliques and goes down to and forms the gluteus maximus which is connected to your lats. Doing the following will help with the entire area to tighten and tone up your muscles and help burn the fat around them. Hope all of this helps do lunges, step-up kickbacks, walking downhill, running, leg raises without weight or very light weight, yoga, push ups, lat pull downs, pull ups rowing, and deadlifts. All of this combined with a proper diet full of lean protein and carbs, and you should be in business. If you need anymore help email me.

I take Sundays off to rest and relax. Push pull for example is doing triceps extension with or without a break then doing biceps curls and adding reverse or regular crunches in there to make sure I get abs in and it cuts down on time. I do abs a lot to keep my core strong. I try to get all of the muscles in that area to work together on the same day. Do the amount of weight for what you want to accomplish. Say for toning, lightweight and high reps (15-20) and 3-4 sets. To build muscle, 2-3 sets and 10-12 reps. All beginners need to start with 1-2 sets and 8-10 reps with lightweights. Remember to stretch after your workout to keep from cramping up.10-15 minutes of stretching is optimal. This workout can be done all at once or like you would do 2 a days.<br>  <br>  Monday- biceps triceps and shoulders/ cardio for 65 minutes <br>  Tuesday – cardio 1hr and 15 min/abs<br>  Wednesday - chest back and abs/ cardio for 65 minutes<br>  Thursday cardio 1 hour and 15 minutes<br>  Friday- legs/ cardio for 65 minutes <br>  Saturday- cardio hour and 15 minutes/ abs<br>  Sunday- off<br>  <br>  This routine has helped me lose 70 lbs of fat and 16 inches off my entire body and gain 45 lbs of muscle after having a baby. I was 180 in March of this year and now I am 140 lean and solid at 5'1"(do not look it though). Still losing fat and gaining muscle.
iBsdnNDXaa	The most effective way to burn fat is to consume less and workout more often, the problems appear when we actually aim to put that into practice! There are lots of opportunities to fail out there don't you think?!

stCyrS4Eaa	The human papilloma virus (HPV) is an extremely common infection among the general population. The HPV virus is believed to affect an estimated 80% of the population. There are about 100 known strains of HPV.<br>  <br>  HPV Symptoms<br>  More often than not, people infected with HPV are not even aware of it. This is because the virus often does not cause any symptoms. Although HPV infects women and men equally, men are much more likely than women to be asymptomatic. However, even without any symptoms of HPV, you are still very contagious and can infect your partner.<br>  <br>  Symptoms for Genital Warts<br>  If you are infected with a strain of HPV that causes genital warts, you may develop symptoms of genital warts anywhere from a few weeks to a few months after exposure. If you have an outbreak of warts, then you should see your doctor about genital warts treatment. In some cases, though, the virus may lay dormant in your system for a FEW YEARS before you develop any genital warts symptoms.<br>  <br>  I would not be so quick to say she cheated.

So you both need to be tested...|`|ezT7xruoaa	First of all: polygraphs are very unreliable, and can be cheated. They cannot be used to prove something like this. <br>  Second, yes you can develop the warts years and years after exposure as the annoying thing is they can lie dormant for years. <br>  The other annoying thing is, you could have given them to her as some people carry the virus but have no symptoms, then infect their partner and suddenly its like, hey you cheated! when its not.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	Hmm yeah it can be hidden for a long time - but 5 yrs is a long a$$ time.<br>  <br>  It is possible that she cheated.

AG9msdUDaa	It is bad to go over 100% for fat, saturated fat and sodium, but not necessarily for carbs (if they are from fruits and vegetables) or fiber, the more fiber the better. Sugar and excess sodium should be avoided at all costs. Sodium can cause you to retain water, making you look puffy. Sugar is what causes you to secrete insulin and it is insulin that packs the sugar away into fat cells in the form of fat.

The quality of sleep patterns can be affected by the things we do an hour or two before bedtime. Are you exercising enough earlier in the day? Are you eating healthy?

6uYVRaebaa	Well whatever it is...an ankle brace can be very helpful for the treatment and prevention of a sprained ankle injury. Walking is inadvisable, as it may cause the ankle sprain to become worse - with increased pain, and possible further damage to the compromised tissues. Braces and crutches give the leg exercise, yet keep the damaged part from moving and becoming further injured.<br>  <br>  Ice can help reducing swelling. Cycles of 10-15 minutes on and 10-15 minutes off are recommended. Icing an ankle too long may cause cold injuries.<br>  <br>  Compression bandages provide support and compression for sprained ankles. Wrapping is started at the ball of the foot and slowly continued up to the base of the calf muscle, pushing the swelling up toward the center of the body so that it does not gather in the foot. Bandages are kept tight, but not so tight as to cut off the circulation in the foot.<br>  <br>  Its probably a Metatarsalphalangeal joint sprain. The injury can be debilitating for athletes who need to accelerate, quickly change direction, or jump. Use of the toes is not possible during the healing process. Since the toes are necessary for proper push-off when accelerating, those sorts of athletic activities can be almost completely curtailed. A healing period of one or more months is often required.|`|qRJztNNZaa	She may have broke it or sprained. MY dad fell and hears a pop in his leg.

87756LlTaa	There are several things that can cause low white cell counts.  Certain medications and drugs are one.  Others include problems with the bone marrow, such as cancer, fibrosis, toxins, or vitamin deficiencies.  Each has a different treatment.  Some are not curable.  There are chapters in medical books that are 100s of pages long on this topic, so I can't get into too much detail here.  A more specific diagnosis or symptom list would help.  <br>  <br>  Effects can range depending on how low the count is or by which kind of white blood cell is low.

If you were to look at a muscle anatomy picture, you will find that what we call love handles are simply our gluteus medius which goes up and connects to the external obliques and goes down to and forms the gluteus maximus which is connected to your lats. Doing the following will help with the entire area to tighten and tone up your muscles and help burn the fat around them.

I take Sundays off to rest and relax. Push pull for example is doing triceps extension with or without a break then doing biceps curls and adding reverse or regular crunches in there to make sure I get abs in and it cuts down on time. I do abs a lot to keep my core strong. I try to get all of the muscles in that area to work together on the same day. Do the amount of weight for what you want to accomplish. Say for toning, lightweight and high reps (15-20) and 3-4 sets. To build muscle, 2-3 sets and 10-12 reps. All beginners need to start with 1-2 sets and 8-10 reps with lightweights. Remember to stretch after your workout to keep from cramping up.10-15 minutes of stretching is optimal.

6qsocyK3aa	No, hun, when you get your period you loose blood. <br>  <br>  The blood is the lining of the womb leaving your body when the egg inside you has not been fertilised by the man's sperm. <br>  <br>  The white stuff is discharge and you usually get it for a while before you get your period. Have your breasts started to grow, are you getting stomach cramps and is your face spotty? All these are signs your period is just round the corner.<br>  <br>  Take care. :)|`|bmWKETgWaa	It sounds like very early puberty to me.  Your periods, which are a flow of bleeding that lasts four or five days, are probably at least a year in the future.  What you are experiencing is probably the beginning of normal lubrication from your vagina.  <br>  <br>  Ask your mum or another female relative about it, or your school nurse.  If the "stuff" has a noticeable odor, you should find out what's going on right away.|`|vP3Tu9SVaa	I do not think it is. You might ask your mother.

I'm not a girl but we did learn about the female system in Health Class yesterday. Periods happen when the female eggs aren't fertilized (Which since your ten, I'm sure they aren't) Then you bleed out of your (you know what) and you shed the non fertilized egg with it. And periods are red, since it is blood so I'm sure it isn't your period. Your only ten and usually periods start when you get a little older. I would ask your mom about it though.|`|Gu2E2guZaa	No darling, you are probably experiencing discharge which is very normal, and is a sign that you're going to start your period soon :] Call it a countdown to womanhood. <br>  Start using pantyliners such as Bodyform or Alldays, just in case honey.|`|Y6K9jwXzaa	it's not a period. your period is blood. it's most likely discharge. it's harmless unless it's green or yellow which means you have a vaginal infection. as long as it's clear or white then you're ok.

Muscle soreness that occurs directly after a workout is known as acute muscle soreness. Acute muscle soreness may last up to hour following exercise and may dissipate soon after. The cause of acute muscle soreness or inflammation may be due to a reduction in blood flow to the muscle and an accumulation of metabolic byproducts like hydrogen ions or lactic acid. Recovery follows when enough oxygen gets to the muscle. Post-exercise muscle soreness (PEMS) or delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) happens when the muscles are sore 12-48 hours after exercise. Some soreness is alright, but excruciating pain is not. If you experience slight discomfort from soreness, you can help alleviate the pain by placing ice on the sore area and stretching while you have the ice pack on. Stretching with the ice pack is on will help relive some of the tightening of the sore muscle the next morning. This is nothing to get freaked out about. Our bodies undergo the processes of inflammation, repair and remodeling in response to the stress imposed by training. This will occur even when you use right form and technique. If you do feel excruciating pain you may need to; call your doctor right away.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Recuperation tips<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Pre-training<br>  <br>   Before we discuss aspirin, I have to stress to allows follow your doctors orders before taking any medications. Aspirin is not something to take all of the time. If you know that you are not supposed to take anything like aspirin then this tip is not for you. Don’t feel like you have to do this, this is only a tip for those who can take aspirin. <br>  <br>        Aspirin operates on a variety of levels. It helps to improve blood flow by reducing the body’s output of thromboxane, a natural which causes blood platelets to become stickier. Research has proven that smaller doses of aspirin are as effective as larger doses with less possibility of stomach irritation. To protect your stomach lining even better crush of the aspirin between two spoons and add them to a glass of milk. Aspirin also reduces edema (swelling) after hard training. You should try to only take aspirin on the heavier training days if you can take aspirin. Once again< I cannot stress the importance of following your doctors orders first. I cannot be responsible for you not doing so.<br>  <br>        Leg elevation is another way to help the blood flow to our legs. Many people today spend eight or more hours sitting at their desks and their legs become swollen. Spend 20-30 minutes a day, both during the work day and prior to your leg and/or your lower body workout with your back on the floor and your legs up against the wall or up against the side of a couch or chair. The gravity helps to return the blood back up to the heart, restoring optimum circulation. Doing so will help promote an important physical and psychological transition between work and training.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Recovery during training<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>           Time between sets is important. You must always take no less than a minute break between sets. You can also follow your heart rate. Everyone is different in this area. Usually when you “feel ready” it is alright to start the nest set.<br>  <br>         Movement between sets is important. It is not a good idea to sit down or do as little as possible. The movement could be considered the cool-down from the previous set and the warm-up for the next set. This practice aids circulation and helps reduce swelling of muscular tissues.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Post-training recovery  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>          Contrast showers are done immediately after training. Expose your lower lumbar area to alternating hot and cold water- as hot as you can stand it for two minutes followed by progressively colder water, almost to the point of discomfort.<br>  <br>            Cryokentics is another way to help ease any discomfort. Immediately after leaving the shower, construct an ice bag by placing crushed ice in a Zip-lock bag. Lie down on the floor with your feet propped up on the couch and place the bag under your lumbar spine. To improve the effect of this procedure threefold, try stretching your spine while on the ice. Gently perform side to side flexions alternated with pulling your knees to your chest. Mobilizing your spine this way will help counteract the stiffness that you may have experienced icing your back in the past.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   ISSA-CFT Certified Fitness Trainer<br>  <br>  National power lifting champion/ 101 weight class (high school)<br>  <br>  shannon_du@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mineandmyonlinefriendspicssharin.shutterfly.com/" rel="nofollow">http://mineandmyonlinefriendspicssharin....</a> to see my weight loss results|`|W6wamWLLaa	Sports massage and stretching out plus walknig|`|SyvQXqqgaa	rest is the only thing that will fix it...thats y im always sore..i never rest my body|`|PcuYA37aaa	I have absolutely no idea where they're getting their information from about taking cold baths and showers to get rid of muscle soreness. Think about it: Cold + Tight and Sore Muscles = The Worse Muscle Cramps And Spasms Of Your Life! Here is what I recommend: Take a warm to hot shower or bath and relax into it. Take as long as you need or want to before getting out and toweling off. Have someone you trust to massage you, either full bodied -full back, thighs, legs, arms, and shoulders- or only where you hurt, with Icy Hot. I would say while wearing a pair of gloves so that he or she won't have to worry about getting it in their eye or something even after washing their hands thoroughly, but not everyone has a box of medical gloves handy 24/7. Take something for pain and get a good night's sleep after clothing. If you're wearing something that doesn't cover you fully and you don't want to get the icy hot on your sheets -depending on if he or she rubbed it in or not- then lay down a towel or two so that you can sleep with no worries. ^^ I hope that helps.|`|oHKipNjxaa	Well when you first start getting a lot of exercise, your using alot of muscles in areas you have never used that much before.

oQcrq39Eaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  I like Savannah's answer above but would add the following:<br>  Most novice meditators are often frustrated by wandering thoughts.  This often leads the meditator to become less relaxed and a bit stressed as they try in vain to clear his/her mind.  So whats the solution?  It's simple really - as your mind slips away from concentrating on your breathing (for instance) and perhaps you become aware of a bird chirping nearby, instead of getting angry for allowing your mind to slip from breathing to the bird, simply allow your focus to shift to the sound of the bird thus staying relaxed and still meditating.|`|689efd040f7aee45255236da1af351baaa	You can try online guided meditation at <br>  <a href="http://clicktomeditate.com" rel="nofollow">http://clicktomeditate.com</a><br>  <br>  It is free and you can give it a try, there is no email/name asked for.<br>  <br>  It is a site that is getting new meditations of different types each day.|`|cob5nbCwaa	Hi,<br>  You can start with the basics of just concentrating on your breathing to start with.

Secondly, if you do not have that requirement, you will simply need to find a neurologist who does not require a referral.  Some do, others allow a patient to "self-refer".

If you need a referral depends on your insurance coverage and the doctor.  If you don't know if your insurance has referral free specialist appointments, call the number on the back of the insurance card and ask them.  Also check with the appointment person when you call to make an appointment with the neurologist.  Some doctors insist that you have a referral but that is a small number of doctors that do that.  Best of luck to you.

AA12145338	No it will not affect your literacy, comprehension,etc. Since your OCD revolves around reading, or an occasional slip of grammar which happens to all of us, it affects you differently and is more noticeable to you. It then in return, feeds the obsessive thoughts of your fear. It reinforces your worst fear=OCD. I truly wish you the best in this disorder, but I will reinforce that you will not lose your intelligence, your ability to read, etc.
6uYVRaebaa	Rest: The sprain should be rested. No additional force should be applied on site of the sprain.<br>  Ice: Ice should be applied immediately to the sprain to minimize swelling and ease pain. It can be applied for 20-30 minutes at a time, 3-4 times a day. Ice can be combined with a wrapping to minimize swelling and provide support.<br>  Compression: Dressings, bandages, or ace-wraps should be used to immobilize the sprain and provide support. <br>  Elevation: Keeping the sprained joint elevated above heart level will also help to minimize swelling.|`|JBuNJJbkaa	Ice it to reduce swelling, then tape it with sports tape to keep it from moving as much. you will still be able to move other parts of your hand.
wGTisY1aaa	You cannot just do sit-ups to help get rid of love handles or make your stomach flat, and you cannot get thinner thighs by just doing workouts for your thighs. If you were to look at a muscle anatomy picture, you will find that what we call love handles are simply our gluteus medius which goes up and connects to the external obliques and goes down to and forms the gluteus maximus which is connected to your lats. Doing the following will help with the entire area to tighten and tone up your muscles and help burn the fat around them.

I take Sundays off to rest and relax. Push pull for example is doing triceps extension with or without a break then doing biceps curls and adding reverse or regular crunches in there to make sure I get abs in and it cuts down on time. I do abs a lot to keep my core strong. I try to get all of the muscles in that area to work together on the same day. Do the amount of weight for what you want to accomplish. Say for toning, lightweight and high reps (15-20) and 3-4 sets. To build muscle, 2-3 sets and 10-12 reps. All beginners need to start with 1-2 sets and 8-10 reps with lightweights. Remember to stretch after your workout to keep from cramping up.10-15 minutes of stretching is optimal. This workout can be done all at once or like you would do 2 a days.<br>  <br>  Monday- biceps triceps and shoulders/ cardio for 65 minutes <br>  Tuesday – cardio 1hr and 15 min/abs<br>  Wednesday - chest back and abs/ cardio for 65 minutes<br>  Thursday cardio 1 hour and 15 minutes<br>  Friday- legs/ cardio for 65 minutes <br>  Saturday- cardio hour and 15 minutes/ abs<br>  Sunday- off<br>  <br>  This routine has helped me lose 70 lbs of fat and 16 inches off my entire body and gain 45 lbs of muscle after having a baby. I was 180 in March of this year and now I am 140 lean and solid at 5'1"(do not look it though). Still losing fat and gaining muscle.|`|jL0Y27g2aa	you were probably doing excersizes that bulk the muscle, now try lengenthing workouts (try taking ballet!) or look for excersizes that will lenghten|`|1vycD2EOaa	Start running marathons.

f8mLpPXlaa	Sure, you can take a hot steamy shower for a long time breathing in the steam. Then put your face in the water stream and snort into your nose.I know this sounds crazy but just do it. Then go make yourself a nice cup of hot chocolate and sip it. Go to bed, curl up with a good book and rest. Repeat as often as needed until you feel better. <br>  Are you taking the RobitussinDM? Or try Mucinex DM. Both should work well on your cough. The DM part is the important thing. Dextromethorophane. Good stuff.<br>  God bless and help you feel better soon.|`|eFs3BUVkaa	Best suggestion is to see a doctor if you haven't already done so. 3-5 weeks is way to long to have a cough without making sure it's not a sign or symptom of something else. If the doctor doesn't see any big problems or put you on an antibiotic try Mucinex. It works WONDERS at clearing the mucus (which will eliminate the cough)<br>  <br>  P.S Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant which is secondary. The most important ingredient would be an expectorant that would clear the mucus out and as a result eliminate the cough|`|04833260a508ecf8d2a4938012444526aa	Is it yellow or green?It could be an infection.You may need an antibiotic.Go to the doctor.|`|122BF25zaa	it could be bronchitis, you should definitely see a doctor|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Any cough persisting more than a week,should be evaluated by a physician. Here are a few simple home remedies that will help to overcome cough. Use a infusion of ginger thrice a day.  Suck a whole clove without chewing it to soothe a cough.

JsiELu6xaa	No it does not. But drinking to much alcohol makes it impossible to get high off weed. alcohol is definitely the more potent of the two buzzes. But they do cross well when you just drink enough to get a small buzz. Mixing them has never made me sick at all.|`|CkIeCNS4aa	Too  much of either will make you feel pretty gnarly, but there's no chemical reaction or anything that will make you "really sick".|`|FgPZ8Sl8aa	I've gotten the spins from being very drunk and then smoking.

c14d3b5cbe3c5671fb48605311d2e82caa	yup. its called obsessive compulsive disorder .<br>  <br>  Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental disorder most commonly characterized by intrusive, repetitive thoughts resulting in compulsive behaviors and mental acts that the person feels driven to perform, according to rules that must be applied rigidly, aimed at reducing anxiety by preventing some dreaded event or by resolving a more nebulous sense of tension. However, the likelihood that a dreaded event will occur, or the causal relationship between the performance of compulsions and the reduction of this likelihood, tends to be imagined or exaggerated.|`|ldpDzaolaa	Nothing to worry about, just accept your self. You could try to be 30" early instead of an hour. you can have an anxiety disorder about anything, even being anxious.

If she is truly overweight, her doctor would tell her and she would have a plan. She might just be norma, but it is nice for you to care. If you find out she does need to loose some weight, just support her. Say nice things like"your pants look good" or "you look happy today" to make her feel more confident. Also, you can invite her over to go swimming or ride bikes or whatever else. Maybe you can do one of the dance video things like Wii, B-you, or the Alyson Stoner project. They have all been hits! It might also be fun to make your own healthy meal together or sign up for a yoga class together!|`|fvf9IKlKaa	If u really think that u should intervene then try to do something that makes exercising fun.

I can see in them the worriness, even so, i try to cheer em up a bit just to ease their burden. <br>  <br>  For me, as a best advise, have a personal relationship to God. Talk to Him. Tell Him all that you have in mind. All those thoughts. All the sufferings.

CbtoOaT4aa	When you eat, a lot of your blood is diverted to your GI (gastrointestinal) tract so that you can digest and absorb the meal. All the nutrients from your meal pass into the blood, so the more blood you have there, the better the absorption process.<br>  <br>  Therefore, if you are anemic, and a lot of your blood goes into your GI, there is not much blood left for other organs and you get tired. Or, if your heart is not working so well, there is less blood to pump and it gets worse, also making you tired.<br>  <br>  This can be normal (though I have to say it doesn't ever happen to me), maybe you're getting sick with the flu or something (I can't eat when I'm sick), or maybe it's your heart or your blood. If you have insurance coverage, go the doctor and get a blood test (CBC) - this can show if perhaps you are anemic. Many, many things can make you anemic - if you are anemic, it MUST be investigated further.<br>  <br>  If you can't go to the doctor, try eating more iron. It comes either as supplements (tend to make you nauseous) or just red meat, and lots of green leafy vegs. Try vitamin supplements, too - you may be missing a vitamin (especially if you are vegetarian) and they might help. Give the vitamins at least a month.<br>  <br>  However, if you can, do check with your doctor and get a CBC (complete blood count).|`|ml3myrM7aa	Your body is just digesting your food. It's normal.

Roll up a towel place under your neck several times a day till you no longer feel the numbness. <br>  Also ice placed on the neck will reduce the swelling.<br>  Try for a chiropractic pillow. it did wonders for my numbness.
