obPSaYf3aa	It's basically a double standard because sports medicine dr's. and physical therapists administer steroids to athletes when they suffer traumatic injuries to their extremities or have infections that affect the body by inflaming tissues and organs.    What about those times when Barry was prescribed steroids and received injections of the stuff during and after surgery for the injuries he suffered in the late 90's and early 00's?  Is that not when some of the positive test results surfaced?  After that, I believe that he may have taken PED's in a recreational manner, but it's not for the fans to judge, because it's his body and his career getting affected, and not ours.    Anyways, if he gets a chance to play as a DH this season, I would not be shocked because he's still in playing shape and that the teams can be sued because of collusion between the owners against Barry, so I'd say he has a 50/50 chance of playing this season.|`|gnRiLwSxaa	It matters because he broke homerun records that should belong to someone else.   Also, it matters because steroid use should be curtailed and this might help to do that.|`|0YuchbL8aa	Yes. b/c he holds the all-time home run record ,and they will probably take that away and it'll be open to be broken to other great studs like Ryan Howard/A-Rod/Albert Puhols and plenty more chasing it.  Yes to me that's a big one if he lose out on it. I really hope not b/c it was awesome watching him go deep with balls landing in 3 River Stadium+Da Bay Area!  He's innocent till proven guilty, and he's the man for now that's why,and also he's an automatic Hall of Famer!Plus he still has great skills to play DH a few more seasons with his awesome swing!|`|lBhkWpDoaa	white people seem to love this story|`|v7TXEzYhaa	It matters because he is a cheater.|`|iPWKzzQtaa	It does make a difference to the integrity of the game of baseball and the effectiveness of the American justice system.    You can't just drop a legal case in the middle of proceedings. That is worse than ignoring the offense in the first place.    People like Bonds and Roger Clemens do need to be pursued on charges of perjury......like Bill Clinton...sorry joke, I couldn't resist.|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	but now the government is involved & made it a higher priority than finding Bin Laden|`|UxSF3Doaaa	Good word you are quite a trip!

I would LOOOOVE it if I can fly! :)    Does it matter at this point? This is so touch-and-go, a saying he could be using for medical reasons....|`|UGAr0M3laa	well some people wanna figure out if he did or not (which he did)|`|7zfcYRqwaa	I know, you know, every baseball player knows, Bud Selieg knows, Donald Fehr knows, my mom knows and your mom knows that there was some kind of performance enhancing drug used by Bonds.  Its dragged on too far now and it is a personal grudge between him and the DA and is a total waste of tax payers dollars.  He wont get in the hall, he is shunned by almost all of the baseball fans, so what if he broke some records, in 20 years that record will be broken again, maybe twice (Arod and Pujols maybe someone else).

His TO and FT i cannot tell you as it is hard to find a boxscore from 1986.    yuo probably would have heard if it had happenned as it would have been the single greatest game by any player ever    the answer to your question is No

I didn't get much (any) playing time, but I was pretty good.  I think I was just too quiet, and didn't stand out much in practice.    I am glad I played all 4 years though, and I'm proud of myself I stuck it out for all 4 years, and didn't let others get the best of me.  I would have regretted it if I hadn't played all 4 years.  If you really like basketball, stick with it.  Learning to fit in with a certain coaching style and a certain team is just as important as your actual skills.

1uSoU8Lpaa	It looks okay plus or minus a few games for some of the teams.  Brewers are never given enough respect, as usual.   Who knows, it's all on paper now, I can't wait to see how the season goes.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Remember that odds are set based upon two things: actual assessed chances of the given team, AND (and this is important) the book's interest in attracting bets to a given line. The book wants bets to be well-balanced so that, when it comes time to pay out, they don't lose money, or lose very little.    There's going to be zillions laid on the Yankees no matter what, so in the event that the Yankees do win (won't, but let's think about it), the book needs enough money laid on the other 29 lines to make that payout as painless as possible (and for preference, make some profit). And they're not going to cover all of that on just the Cubs and Red Sox, so there has to be odds tempting enough to get some money laid on the Royals and Nationals as well.    Nothing here looks delusional. Best line, at a glance, is probably the Cardinals. The NL Central is up for grabs, even with the Cubs there, and the wildcard berth isn't that inconceivable. Make it to October and, as we often witness, anything can happen. Yeah, I could see putting down $10 or $20 on St. Louis.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	Yes I agree 100%    Those are the odds.|`|5xIroQjMaa	I'd say the Cubs, Mets, and especially Yankees are incredibly overrated. There'll be alot of money lost on those teams this year. I don't know how the Braves are so high either. They should be closer to 80-1.|`|414b7351b200219e50b4bef935b60195aa	So you are saying that the Yankees have the best chance?

I remember the Mets were 100-1 in 1969, and a few people "cleaned up."|`|ivbnPxSKaa	indians way to high|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	Jack Brickhouse said any team can have a bad century..... well that century is over!

IMu3wBu8aa	To be honest, I want to see Austin vs Taker at Mania 25. The only bad thing is that Austin would have to lose in order to keep Taker's streak alive. Unless, he breaks it! Goes out with a bang. Austin vs Taker would work though. It's unpredictable because Austin is big enough to break his streak. Plus, the match would be awesome. If Austin is willing to lose, it would be awesome. Like I said though, I wouldn't want him losing his probably last match. It does happen though. Flair lost his last match in the WWE.     If I only had to choose out of your two options, Taker vs Shawn. I'd rather this match wait until Mania 26, 27, or 28 though. They could retire Shawn like Flair. Taker could be his last opponent. It's fitting. Then Taker could retire soon after. Having the two biggest Legends retire the same time. I think Mania 25 isn't the right time. Right place, but not time. By the way, Kane would be Taker's last opponent and retire him. Then Kane can stick around a while more. Take care of the young talent and himself, then when the time is right he too can retire (not anytime soon though)!!! :)    Austin vs Hogan...not interested in that one. Hogan and Austin are both injured. That match wouldn't work. Plus, I would rather see Austin go up against anyone else. Like Taker. Even Shawn.|`|2KIRdfIcaa	Undertaker-Shawn because they are definite HOF of wwe, major rivals from the past, and these two men competed in the first ever Hell in a Cell.       I don't have anything against Austin-Hogan, it's just that I prefer Undertaker-Shawn more.|`|U4NaCjbCaa	I rather see Maria vs Mcool for the world champion|`|8fn5bKVtaa	How about neither!

Honestly, Austin vs Hogan. Sure the match work rate wise would probably suck, but its the match that NEEDS to happen. The two biggest names in WWE history finally going at it. They never had a match before.|`|ePvvGUu3aa	If I can only pick on, I'll pick the Undertaker and Shawn Michaels match instead. Undertaker - Shawn Michaels: These two are long overdue their re-match from Royal Rumble 1998. I believe this match will be another classic added to both of them and to the WWE. As they are aging and everything, their still able to make the best of it. Both are nearly active, so we wouldn't see a very slow match and both have already bonded chemistry throughout all their years together. That's my choice, but honestly wouldn't mind seeing both.     I rather not want Hogan or Austin to risk getting a serious injury or making a current injury worse. Besides, both of them will have a heavy amount of ring rust due to the years not in the ring. If we were talking about when they were healthy, then count me in with Austin and Hogan.
Sqz8V76yaa	There is no substitute for talent!  With that said, you need to play the game.  What position do you play?  Are you quick?  How is your arm?  Can you throw well for your position?  Can you hit?  Can you hit for power?  Are you consistent in hitting, fielding, throwing?  And, are you playing right now?  The one thing I can tell you is this....lift weights and get stronger, especially your upper body.  Talk to your high school coach about lifting specifically for baseball!    Having been a college and high school coach in southern California, the kids there play all year round and they have a definite advantage over the kids who live in the midwest like you do.  Unless you can move to a warmer climate so you can play more, your chances to play Division 1 will take some doing.  However, you are only limited by your persistence and dedication to become that player for UCLA.  Work hard, find places to hit, throw and run in the off season and never lose sight of your dream.  It is a worthwhile goal!    Best of luck!|`|t3hrq6qyaa	be really really good at baseball     GOOD LUCK|`|l0iCqzlQaa	heres a tip, wake up

Here's why it would make them a dynasty:    If Lebron is making the players on the teams that he's on now imagine what he would do if he was on the lakers.Big Z is nowhere near as good as Andrew bynum or Pau Gasol.  Gasol and bynum already are good players,imagine if they having Lebron making great passes to them setting them up for easy shots.Lebron is a better passer and clearly better overall.Kobe is the better scorer and is more clutch.  back to what I was saying Lebron could basically do what he wanted cuz the lakers also have a lot of good 3 point shooters,so if he drives he can just kick out.they would also have 3 shot blockers which would be Lebron,Bynum and Gasol which would make there defense better.Lebron is also versatile and can play almost any positon.    Just think about it.I the lakers would win the next 4 or 5 championships if they had lebron.Dont get me wrong the cavs would be good with kobe but not as good as the lakers with lebron.what do yall think?"    copy and pasted from a question I posted not too long ago    edit:WHY NOT? people are always saying Lebron needs help.Mo is the only other all star on the cavs.imagine if Lebron had an all star team like the lakers.he would average a triple double with no problem    ANOTHER EDIT:if thats the case then why couldn't the cavs win a game without lebron last year.none of those guys can create there own shot.all those guys you named live off lebron feeding them open passes.why you think they needed to get mo for?|`|HDbMh2YBaa	I think that would be silly for both sides. Brand isnt even having a better year than Odom. So why would the Lakers want him? And who's to decide if Brand goes back to his old self? Usually when a team makes a long term commitment to a guy they dont just trade him after a half a season. How would that make them look? Dont buy into all the rumors.    There arent many big men out there the Lakers could trade in exchange for Lamar Odom. There best bet is to do like last year and survive without Bynum. But at least he has a good chance to come back this time.|`|kNwaM3VWaa	Both would be a waste...Odom was a double double guy and what is he doing now besides passing to Kobe...anyway...Odom runs the three and Brand is more confortable at the four...and that where Pau is...and either way...Brand would no longer be a double double guy...wait...who has actually gotten a double double on that squad consistently besides...wait...wait...I know this one...|`|WUzgGtAAaa	Brand is gone for the year, but if he was healthy I think he would be a good fit for the Lakers. He is much more consistant than Odom. Brand is almost always a 20pt 10 reb kind of guy and gets blocks. Odom is a good rebounder, but his jumper is on and off.  Brand is money from 15 feet in, I think he'd fit in the triangle.    That being said, he blew his achilles last year and has shoulder problems this year. I dunno if he'll be as good as he used to be in his Clipper days.|`|DDmFQU7raa	I say -- DO IT!    We need a physical presence, and Elton Brand would fit the mold!|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Brand just signed a huge contract this past off season and Odom is a free agent. Please explain how their salaries match?|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Brand is out for the entire season anyway.|`|RvI1gGbDaa	That would be a great trade because he could start while Bynum is out and I think he'd be okay with coming off the bench if the Lakers were winning championships. He would also be great with stopping the penetration if Gasol or Bynum were on the bench and would provide some toughness that we need.

I think Triple H will win the SmackDown Elimination Chamber (eliminating Edge last), but I would most like to see Undertaker emerge victorious.    I'm liking Randy Orton's odds against Shane McMahon.    The way the HBK-JBL storyline is being set up, it's almost as if WWE is announcing weeks in advance that HBK will win, even though I want JBL to win.    I don't know nor care who wins between Finlay and Jack Swagger.

Id4OLpIZaa	Lol. Definitely not those sausages in Milwaukee (I'm not 100% sure if it's the Brewers mascots...please correct me if I'm wrong).      What about our founding fathers in Washington (Presidents mascots). Again I'm not 100% sure if they are the nationals mascots.     However, I'll go with Mr. Met, since I am a met fan (biased opinion). Hopefully nobody will confuse his head with a baseball and attempt to take a swing. Lol.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Mr Met|`|IPy8h0VVaa	The Phillie Phanatic, hands down.  ESPN even ranked him as the greatest mascot in all of sports.

7oHt9fTkaa	true  no one talk about cricket.everyone talked about their own team.  specially Arun Lal,i thought he will be one of the best commentator in future.but he is dumb.  he is very capable only for birds and animal watching.not for cricket watching.he always appreciate Indian batsman,if it was a wicket.and when Indian batsmen batting,there will be two or three "magnificent""awesome""brilliant" in a one over.|`|AA11088802	i  ve not heard it mucch|`|G8jYlPqSaa	I totally concur.    It has been very very boring. Most of the Lankan commentators (except maybe Ranil Abeynayake) talk on something which is not related to cricket like King Coconuts and Massages (a couple of Indian Commentators). Arun Lal has been going on and on about the Indian team, Sunny has been a lot better given that he's more diplomatic.    Overall, id say we're lucky since Ranjit Fernando is missing! If he were here, then things would be worse.    PS-Hearty congrats to team India for playing some great cricket, and dont let a couple of drunk Idiots throwing stones at your players put you off from coming into Sri Lanka.

As a Yankee fan, I know what a bad reputation my teams fan base has. I hate when I see people feeding into that perception and acting exactly the way people would expect.|`|LRvjfQyhaa	Mets fans.  All they do is talk up a big game when their team hasn't done anything worth bragging about the past few years.    I dread when they come to town because that's when all the trouble happens at the ballpark.  Trust me, I'm one of the people who have to deal with it.  We never have as many problems with fans of other teams as we do with the Mets.|`|sBeZWl35aa	In my case, im a huge cubs fan.  So i am the first fan in Milwaukee a.k.a. Wrigley North.

Carl Pavano.  He has a chance to make the Indians rotation, he's healthier than he has been latley, he doesn't have to pitch under the pressure of New York City, and he'll probably still be available in the last round in just about every draft.|`|9d9b8b9e4972c1f3e7d9b9e80936b200aa	cal ripken jr.|`|OJHO52UJaa	going in by fielding pos  -Rick harden great strike out pitcher, just a lil injury prone  -Ricky nolasco, marlins, great year, went completely unoticed  -Ludwick, had MVP style year last year and will be under the radar  -placido polanco, great average hitter, hardly ever strikes out, great fielder surrounded by a great team will get lots of runs  -Mark Derosa, some what above average numbers, but can play every position  -Brandon Inge same thing   but you should get me on your team|`|geih5vR8aa	LOL!!  How much money we talkin here?    Max Scherzer and Joba Chamberlain aren't exactly sleeper picks, but they shouldn't go too high... that being said, try and draft these guys. Max is a fireballer, and Joba is on the Yankees, with an awesome lineup. He could have an ERA of 5.00 and still get 15 wins.    The Giants just signed Randy Johnson. If you're in a serious league, he'll go early. Yeah, yeah, he's not a sleeper either, but he looks to be healthy again, and he can still throw at a high level.   -- that being said, keep an eye out for the Giants, and if they can pick up a good hitter. Then Cain, Lincecum and Johnson should be considered candidates for your team.  -- Also, Zito has started working out? NO WAY! He has gained strength this off season... a good deal amount too. Look for him to actually rebound this season and turn in a decent year, worthy of maybe half of what he gets paid... lol.   -- Giants also have Travis Ishikawa penciled in at 1st base. He seems to have made strides recently to make the Giants think he found his power stroke.      Ok, none of those guys are real "Sleepers", because Joba and Max were sought after players last year.    The Giants do have Fred Lewis who is a speedy outfielder, and will steal you 30 bags if he's healthy. He has the potential to hit .300 with 20-25 HR's.   -- but the real sleeper on the Giants is PABLO SANDOVAL. The dude can rake.    Look at the corner outfielders on the Dodgers and D-Backs. They are young and starting to come into there own. Conor Jackson at first, Mark Reynolds at 3rd and Upton at Center for the D-Backs. Eithier and Loney are good sleepers for the Dodgers. BUT the guy you really want is MATT KEMP. In his first full season, .290 BA, 18 HR's, 76 RBI's, 93 Runs and 35 SB, which is the stat that jumps out at you. He has tons of potential, and speed is just icing on the cake.   --too bad I'm a Giants fan... i have to hate this guy.    JAY BRUCE on the Reds is the real deal too. He came up last year too, but he might be pretty low on everyone's radar still, unless you're in a serious league.    Later in the season, look out for Bumgarner or Alderson.... top notch pitching prospects... and Villalona and Buster Posey are great hitting prospects.        And to the guy above me, retarted is spelled retarded. Use your spell checker before you talk **** about someone's spelling.|`|B5BWocvZaa	matt wieters,adam jones,david price|`|NDFxaLq9aa	Rick Harden?  I think your looking for Rich Harden, and if you think harden and ludwick are 'sleepers' and can be drafted in the late rounds, you are retarted....I'm not real good at picking sleepers, but harden and ludwick wont be around that long.  A couple of sleepers that I think might do well that you can get in the late rounds-Mark Buehrle, he is a work horse, but does not get many k's....look for around 16 to 18 wins this year.  Willy Tavares (not sure thats spelled right) great speed, will get a lot of stolen bases....should comeback this year
Ar5IuU2Uaa	I would struggle to name ten - Camp of Champions (COC) is certainly not the best ski camp, best snowboard camp in Whistler - but its ski coaching infrastructure simply isn't up to standard - for skiers Momentum Ski Camps is a different league.|`|dcfVXO43aa	I don't know all ten but i think that the Camp of Champions is definitely up there.

The Tigers signed him! That's an example, I really don't like rumors like what happened with CC and the Brewers and Johan and the Mets.|`|R0sfdiNeaa	I am sick of hearing about what he won't take.  I hope he ends up without a team this year!|`|fQIxah8laa	Yeah this is getting dull and boring. Sign Already!|`|B5BWocvZaa	not as old as tex. you wait for brett favre's stories on his decisions on retiring.....great|`|Id4OLpIZaa	Yea I agree. He just hurt himself when the Mets told  the press that they are pretty much done with all of the off season moves. So now his value will go down since he is in less of a demand (dodgers don't have to compete with the Mets to sign him). I'll be surprise if he gets an offer more than $25 million again from any other team. So basically he should of accepted that previous offer.|`|lBhkWpDoaa	this time of year is considered down time    when spring training kicks in there will be more news to report|`|2wgEsVmsaa	That's just the Manny story being the Manny story!|`|utTFiz3gaa	i say all the teams should get together shun him out of a job lol    that's mean i know but that would be funny.. baseball being baseball XD..

WZvny7mMaa	Jordans was more impressive|`|csKyqot0aa	Michael Jordan.|`|98wFqBwSaa	Michael's by far.  If Kobme is a guard and he had 40 touches, then he should have more than 2 assists.

What did he do sleep with you mom or something?|`|DkwgogXZaa	Kobe's....dropping 81 on a pro team, that's just embarrassing|`|N2177Ameaa	Kobe may have the edge on points, but it's not all about scoring. Jordan achieving a career high on boards and points is much more impressive and the game was even on the road against a rival playoff team, unlike Kobe with less assists, boards & steals and the game was at home against a team that was nowhere near as good as the team that Jordan faced.|`|Mi3rHjcYaa	Whats your point? We get it... Jordan is better than Kobe, why do you keep stating the obvious.    You really need to get a life, Laker fans admitted that Jordan is the GOAT.    edit: You have way too much time on your hands to research all these pointless Stats. Get a job.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Jordan's in my opinion.
16846f69e9f2c7715f01b43ed1707e57aa	Elton Brand is overrated. Also, they were a worse team when he played because he slowed them down. He wasn't a good fit to begin with. He only went to philly because they offered the most money(smart business decision but not for philly). I am puzzled as to why people think he's so great.

Hopefully his surgery is successful and he's back to playing the game like he used too.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	is he injured again? how is that not a surprise? he is starting to look like yao or arenas, always getting hurt and staying hurt. well the team seems to play well without him so there is no change really. i haven't put that puch attention to them though.|`|7RmIWxFzaa	The Sixers will be fine without him. He really hasn't been a great addition to the team anyway.   The Sixers will still make the playoffs. Hopefully, next season Brand can play better.
AA11322117	Unlike the previous two answerers, the correct answer is yes... hypothetically.    The MVP is voted on by the media.  Theoretically, if two players both got the same number of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th place votes for season MVP -- then, yes, they could be named MVP.    It's highly unlikely, but it could happen.|`|N2177Ameaa	No it's not possible.|`|98wFqBwSaa	No, it is not possible to have two MVPs in the regular season and it is not possible to have two in the post season either.

jHJ0W9QNaa	i don't think so... the Suns will ask too much for Amare Stoudemire and i don't think the Pistons would want to give up Stuckey. the Pistons would be better off waiting for 2010, when all the top free agents are available.|`|fuYYRJXtaa	They just got to wait till 2010...

There is no way that the suns would get equal value back if they were to trade him.    If the suns made that trade there roster would barely put up a fight against the Thunder at the end of the year.    Once they decide to finally build a team around him, then the suns will finally have an identity.|`|AA11488609	I like the guy who put the Antawn for Amare trade.  Kerr is a high GM, and at least they have a class act in Jamison, but we need a big man, and Amare will be that guy if we get him in a trade.  Also getting Amare removes us the burden of "what if we don't get Griffin AND Thabeet".  They could both stay in college next year and we could be the  1 team in the lotto and that would be close to the worst case scenario for us besides getting a bad lotto pick.|`|3teWTOPqaa	lol, maybe the Lakers can get him for Odom + Walton + pick. With Brand out of the picture, Amare is probably the best PF for the Lakers.
aDKVJJ7Maa	High five for trying something new! I'm fifteen and I started taking tumbling classes about five months ago. I absolutely love it, and I am learning back handsprings already!    Anyway, the first step would be to find a gymnastics club in your area. Google it, I'm sure you can figure out how to do this for yourself. :)    Once you've found a club, you need to decide what kind of gymnastics you would like to do. A lot of this decision will depend on what kind of programs your club has, but you should also think about what kind of things you would like to focus on. What about gymnastics excites you? If you like the idea of learning tricks on beam, vault, or bars, you would probably like a traditional gymnastics class most. If you also like dancing, you might want to look into rhythmic gymnastics. If floor sounds fun, but you don't really want to learn tricks for the other appendices (beam, vault, bars), try to find a tumbling class. Different gyms are organized different ways, so you might start out in a beginner's class with little kids, but you might not. My gym has a teen/ adult session that is open to all levels, so that you can be in a class with people your own age while you're learning the basics.    Don't worry about starting out late. Like I said, I started at fifteen with no gymnastics experience and five months later I can do cartwheels, one-handed cartwheels, round-offs, front and back walkovers, front handsprings, and back handsprings with a spot. Stretch well and often (especially your back! Because 1. If you have a flexible back, everything becomes inordinately easier and 2. Back injuries suck, trust me), do simple strength exercises like push-ups and crunches, practice everything often, don't be afraid to ask your coach questions, be brave, and have fun! Good luck, and hope I helped!|`|FXczaymzaa	I started doing regular gymnastics, but moved over to trampolining a few years later.. You will start in a beginners class, which does tend to be little kids so you'll have to work hard to move up quickly.   Though I quit for a while, and went back to trampolining when I was 16 - I was the oldest in my class, but it's really not that bad. You can have fun even if everyone's younger.. After a while they just know you as 'you', not some older scary person. And, admittedly the conversations aren't as good, but you can definitely have a laugh.  Besides, you could always drag a friend along with you.    Any questions about training, feel free to email me (=  laura-jane-17@hotmail.co.uk|`|i1NOSmI6aa	HI, I've been doing gymnastics since I Could walk, I'm also 14 now, What type of gymnastics are you interested in? RG (hoops balls and stuff) or WAG (floor, beam bars and stuff) Well I did RG for a few years wasnt my thing, So i treied WAG, and to me its the BEST ever! lol, Being a beginner is ok, alot of the coaches are very suportive and paitent, But doing gymnastics also comes with its injury's, I've knocked myself out with a club, broken both my wrists (not at once, lol) But i'm just accedent prone, but still, Gymnastics is a lot of fun, and a great choice, Good LUCK!|`|UOZGLCfNaa	RELAX everyone starts as a beginner its okay|`|1e214dda0bb6a3cf454196f01665db75aa	you should contact a local gym in your area (if you dont know any just search in google "gymnastics near city, state") just give them a call and tell them you want to do gymnastics for fun......If i were you, i would think about doing one on one lessons, or else you will be put in a class with 5 year olds, just because you are a beginner. Gymnastics is very fun, but it can also be kind of expensive. I was a cheerleader in high school, which required us to do gymnastics, I am now a freshman in college and Im not a cheerleader anymore, but I still do gymnastics, because i like fell in love with it haha Good luck with everything!
AA10297143	Height is not an overwhelming factor, and 5'1" at the age of 14 is OK too.  You want to be a tad taller I think if you want to go into Collegiate ball or higher.  Just my take.  You will grow more, don't worry.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Height can be helpful in certain positions, but its not really that important. First basemen are usually tall with long arms so they can reach to catch a bad throw without taking their foot off the base, or reach out and catch the throw a split second sooner.     At pitcher, longer arms act like a longer lever to generate speed, plus longer legs mean more power, so most of the hard-throwing pitchers are above average height.     Height also helps get better bat speed and power at hitting, but the great thing about baseball is there is always room for someone who can hit singles for a high average.     Think about fielding. If someones legs are 8" longer than yours, and his arms are 6" longer than yours, it increases his range by 14" in terms of diving or reaching for a ball. But if you are only slightly faster in reaction speed you can make up for the 14" of range (plus a lot more). Plus, it doesn't matter how far someone can reach to catch a ball if they can't actually catch it when they get their hands out there.     The bottom line is that if two players had exactly the same amount of talent, the taller player would have a very slight advantage, but a tiny bit of extra talent is more valuable than a big height advantage.|`|mcE9C06Saa	no|`|sBeZWl35aa	If you have good fundamentals and you're a good player size should not matter.  Look at some of the MLB players, they're not all 6 foot.|`|kY6v1C7Naa	height doesnt mattter, look at chone figgins, hes only 5'8 and hes a badass|`|ZKyqU6RDaa	Height can help in certain situations like jumping for a ball, you typically have longer reach and could potentially hit outside pitches easier, you would have more leverage pitching etc. but it's nowhere near as important as height in basketball, or even football.  Also you are only 14, you will grow until you are 21. If you enjoy baseball, keep playing.|`|4tynRVpzaa	If you're Dominican or Puerto Rican you're fine.|`|8yrIvPFOaa	it varies depending on position; almost all pitchers are really tall because it really helps to create power with their legs and provides for greater arm extension. being tall is helpful because it (usually) allows for greater range on the field and more power.    but, this is obviously not the case for everybody. look at tim lincecum: he just won the cy young in the national league and is only about 5 feet 9 inches. or dustin pedroia, m.v.p. and former rookie of the year, who is not very tall but has a big swing and makes up for lack of size with good technique.    dont worry dude, youll grow, youre a freshman.

0TuWYaneaa	If you want to hit anything I suggest a pellet gun only no bb. I have a breakdown that you load 1 at a time its really accurate and has enough power to make long shots if you want.

fvMv1DT3aa	I like them all but probably Raw's and ECW's a little bit better than Smackdown's. I liked ECW's because it was the first one to ever happen and it was just really fun to watch. And, seeing Matt Hardy win a good singles title was worth it. I liked Raw's because Chris Jericho won it and I loved him being the champion. Plus, he wasn't originally scheduled to compete in it so it was a great unexpected surprise. I actually did like the concept because anybody had a chance of winning and the audience was left guessing up until the end about who was going to win.|`|X9iZA9svaa	the smackdown one was the best when triple h won it and yes i did like the concept i thought they were all good actually|`|9CLRMnhSaa	LOVED THE WWE CHAMP|`|OGPW7xZ2aa	i was like wtf is this i like the smackdown one coz hhh was the only one to keep hes title|`|ePvvGUu3aa	Out of the three, SmackDown was my favorite.    Yeah, I thought it was a very good concept. The only problem was them using that match for all three brands. The match is good at the point where it will go left and right from who holds on to the title at the time being. Also the shockers the match can bring, last minute wins and "surprise entrance" (e.g.: Chris Jericho). The match even helps to better of story telling. That's my opinion on the match and I would like them to use it again, but not use three in one night.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	I thought they were ok. I liked the concept, and I think WWE dropped the ax on Mike Adamle too quickly since I thought he was improving. They should of turned him full fledged heel instead of making him a tweener.|`|hL3eS2zKaa	...|`|P3g2Gz2Yaa	adamle was a ***** !! glad he left hahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa|`|HvnFTNmCaa	The only one that I cared for was the ECW Scramble.

AA11482019	March 17, 2002 at WrestleMania X8 (18) in Toronto, Ontario.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMani...|`|0ylaEVtraa	WrestleMania X8 (18) in Toronto, Ontario  The match between The Rock and Hollywood Hulk Hogan, dubbed "Icon vs. Icon"[29], was next. Despite the portrayals by Rock and Hogan as the face and heel for the match respectively, the Canadian crowd chose to cheer Hulk Hogan over The Rock instead.[24][25] During the match, The Rock locked on the Sharpshooter, causing Hogan to tap out. However, the referee was down and unable to acknowledge the submission. The Rock let go of the hold and tried to revive the referee, but Hogan gave him a low blow followed by own version of The Rock's finisher, the Rock Bottom for a two-count.[26] The two tried their respective finishers, the Rock Bottom and the leg drop but each kicked out. After two more Rock Bottoms and a People's Elbow, The Rock pinned Hogan and win the match. After the match, the two shook hands in respect. As The Rock left the ring, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall came and attacked Hogan. The Rock returned and saved Hogan from further attack. As a sign of respect, The Rock stopped Hulk from leaving the ring and asked him to pose for the crowd, turning Hogan back into a face aga|`|7ACBEowxaa	Wrestlemania 18, and backlash   2003 no way out    rock won both|`|WuIMANnMaa	they faced in Wrestlemania 18, in Houston, for the WWE championship.

The knicks used to be a powerhouse in the late 90's early 2000's. The had ewing and he was a great help. They are not even a .500 team now and it does not matter who they beat once in a while because the playoffs don't let you in for beating teams who are over .500. The playoffs are for teams who are consistent and win almost all games. Maybe that's why people are saying that.

It's true, your team's defense is horrendous, and eeven though Kobe and Lebron are the two best players in the game today, they shouldn't be scoring more than 50, unless you put only David Lee to guard them.    To even think you guys are possible 6th seed is just unimaginable. Just because you've beaten good teams, doesn't mean that your elite. any team can beat the other team any night. The Heat have the better record and don't face you guys 82 games a season. They have other games that keep them ahead you in the standings.    That being said, the Knicks are a good team, and it's just that they've been laughing stocks for the past 6 years, it's hard to get out of that reputation.    You guys havea great coach, and got some great players. But playing just 8 guys in a run an up and down game for 82 games a season in tiring.    You guys can compete for the 8th seed, but the 6th seed is very VERY highely unlikely.     You guys can score, but you've got to defend.

AA11322117	I think Marion would be great.  He could run the floor, and not clog up the lane for Bosh and Bargnani (assuming O'neal is traded).

50bEHtYfaa	Don't listen to all these comments. Yes it is true that Gilbert has not played a game this season due to his recovery. What people don't realize is last year, when in recovery Arenas checked himself into the game without Eddie Jordan knowing. He went out there with the knee brace on and drained 1 3 pointer and was 4-4 fg, until Eddie Jordan made him come sit. Gilbert is a great player and is deff not overrated. He hasn't played a game this whole season, how is he overrated? People don't realize how much he means to the Washington Wizards team. I am a huge fan of Agent 0, he is my favorite player. I can't wait till hes completely recovered so people can stop hating on him, and the Washington Wizards. When Arenas and Haywood are back in the lineup, the Wizards will be in the top 5 in the western confrence. They all will see. But to answer your question, I would not call him the best in the NBA I would say Michael Jordan is the best of all time. Gilbert Arenas deffinently ranks in the top 10 of current NBA players in my opinion.    Gilbert Arenas  Brendan Haywood  Caron Butler  Antwan Jamison  Deshawn Stevenson    = Unstoppable Washington Wizards team in 2009-2010.|`|UIi7B3UDaa	hahahahahahahahahaahhaahahahahahahahahaa...|`|fuYYRJXtaa	Who's that?

I once fell in love with Gilbert 3 seasons ago, when he averaged 2 steals and 2 threes... but those days are long gone.    Kobe, LeBron, Wade, Nash, Paul, Howard have all had equal or better seasons for longer durations.    Arenas has the talent... but he has to show he has the health to be in the top 3.  He's similar to McGrady in that aspect.|`|5ViCDwf0aa	maybe when he plays. actually no. thre'es  lebron kobe and wade in front of him. they are the top three|`|AA11488609	best in the NBA for doing nothing this season.    He is probably a top 3 three point shooter and top 3 for clutch scorer, but that's the pre injury Arenas here.|`|3teWTOPqaa	There is no doubt in my mind he is the best ever, his stat this season proves it.|`|WZvny7mMaa	He is completely overrated. I put him in my top 3 most overrated players now.|`|Mn97YDIyaa	His stats this season:    0-0  0-0 on threes  0-0 on free throws  0% shooting for everything  0 seconds played  0 points  0 assists  0 rebounds  0 steals  0 blocks  0 EVERYTHING    G.O.A.T....|`|tY3rZSsiaa	hes probably the best at collecting huge amounts of money for writing on a blog.

HlEU7lNGaa	The best way is to be on a club team that plays in "college showcase" tournaments. You can even guest play for a college shocase tournament. You will have limited exposure in high school. Club teams are the best way to get noticed. Also, put your profile up on websites like: berecruited.com  Good luck!|`|z7JsVzcnaa	First thing you need to do is register with the NCAA Clearinghouse.  After that you should start looking at the schools you want to go to and contact the coaches and send them a hilight video of you playing so they can get an idea of what kind of player you are.|`|MzOmEFQNaa	Try googling "soccer scholarships" for starters. Maybe you'll strike gold. You might also find in a soccer magaizine which colleges have soccer programs.
oAjbBLDpaa	First, I'm not an all of a sudden Kane fan, I've been a Kane fan for over 10 years now.    Anyway, I would love the WHC to be put on Kane but I completely understand that he doesn't want it for himself personally because he would rather put over younger talent. But wouldn't he be able to do so by winning the championship and then dropping it to Orton, who can legitimately be predicted to be carrying the company for a long time, and then having a short feud with him?    The IC Championship would be great for him and a program with Punk would be great as well. Punk can alone carry a match and with Kane added to it, it will be an amazing program that could, quite possibly, outperform the main-events of whatever PPV that battle would be on.    I think he really needs some gold on him before his credibility is completely gone even if it's just a short reign. Whether that be IC, WHC, or any other title, most will be content because he makes himself a legitimate opponent.    If they had a good program for him that went back and forth without a title, whether it be with CM Punk or anyone else, that would be amazing as well.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	You posted this and in an interview Kane said about the same thing. I hope this settles the Kane issue. Everybody loves Kane but he is the one who chose to push younger talent.        Kane himself , DOESN'T Want to be WHC.  He Doesn't Want all that Pressure.  He Doesn't Want to Carry the Company  He's a Team Player.  He does What's Right for the BUSINESS.  If that means Jobbing & putting Younger Talent Over - So be It.|`|3cQx8ZFSaa	Kane's a ***** now and he's become boring to watch anyway so its not like it matters what WWE decides to do with him.|`|mDuiiVN7aa	I can see him as I.C or U.S champion, maybe even as ECW champ again.|`|4THkC6Pgaa	people including me are starting to feel sorry for kane, he deserves much better and we don't want to see the likes of rey mysterio and kofi kingston beating him. WE WANT THE OLD KANE BACK! and by the way, there is no reason why kane shouldn't be in the hall of fame in the future. he's a legend.|`|QQyWUDI8aa	WELL HE WANTS TO BE WHC I THINK HE WOULD LOOK GOOD WITH IT HE WOULD MAKE A GOOD WHC THEN HE WOULD BE BABYFACE (THAT IS IN BETWIN FACE AND HEEL) HE WAS A GOOD IC CHAMP     WELL THATS WHAT I THINK|`|wx649tsuaa	Did you know Kane runs a poltical blog under the name of Citizen X ? He is a Libertarian. You can read his ideas here http://adventuresofcitizenx.com/|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	Nothing they do will make up for the fact a great talent like his has held the title a shorter amount of time than people with little talent like Khali. The Undertaker didn't really want the title again either but he has had it because of injury's and for me that's the only way Kane does get the title, if he is one of the few people not out injured. I'd just be happy if Kane was in a good feud, him and Rey on paper sounded good to me but they just didn't gel so it wasn't that good to watch. I've always been a Kaneanite and i understand his role, respect him more for it if anything because unlike some wrestlers he is happy to use his legacy to launch someone else. Not bothered about title's just a good feud to showcase the man's talent would keep me happy.|`|fmUGHvgHaa	cooooool|`|7f2GSDmqaa	That was exactly my question a few hours ago. I asked where all the sudden popularity for Kane came from? Its been very sudden. I guess fans just respect him, and the rumors about him doing good business (ex: turning down title runs, putting over younger talent) has gotten him in the good graces of the fans.
7ACBEowxaa	By January 1998, the WWF began broadcasting more violence, swearing, and more edgy angles in its attempt to compete with WCW. After Bret Hart left for WCW following the Montreal Screwjob incident,  Vince McMahon used the resulting backlash in the creation of his "Mr. McMahon" character, a dictatorial and fierce ruler who favored heels who were "good for business" over "misfit" faces like Austin. This, in turn, led to the Austin vs. McMahon feud, which, along with D-Generation X, officially began the Attitude Era. It also featured the established Monday Night Wars, where both WCW and the WWF had Monday night shows that competed against each other in the ratings. Many new wrestlers came into the WWF such as Chris Jericho, The Radicalz (Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero, Perry Saturn, Dean Malenko) and the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, Kurt Angle, whilst the characters of The Rock (renamed from Rocky Maivia), and Mick Foley (as Mankind, Cactus Jack, and Dude Love) were successfully re-invented to compete at main event level. This era also saw the evolution of more brutal matches with different stipulations to increase viewership, mainly the furthering of Hell in a Cell (notably its 2nd appearance from The Undertaker and Mick Foley) and the Inferno match (introduced by Kane against The Undertaker).        On April 29, 1999|`|7f2GSDmqaa	It didnt start and end on a particular date, it was over a period of time it began and ended.

UWctMa0Taa	The best chance you would have would be the 2004 lakers.  I know our 2004 pistons had 4 players.  I don't know if they all started.

tY3rZSsiaa	lol that would be bad for the lakers.  as much as i like shaq, i dont see him playing as a 3rd/4th option on the lakers with kobe and gasol.  plsu, if bynum comes back, what happens then? will shaq give up his starting job and minutes so he can play 4th/5th option?|`|AA11488609	Combined with an Amare for Jamison trade, a Suns team with Nash, Barbosa, Odom, and Jamison will be kind of fun to watch, though I don't know how far they can go.|`|0gWxnY0Gaa	Haha no!  We keepin Shaq!|`|fuYYRJXtaa	Only for Odom!!     Lakers give up nothing.|`|N2177Ameaa	First of all Shaq's contract is worth $20 million which isn't near as much as Odom's.    Second is that why would the Lakers trade Odom when he's doing great in L.A.    Last but not least Shaq isn't worth Odom, he's getting old and he's not as good as Odom as of now.|`|WZvny7mMaa	Shaq is better than Odom but I don't think the Lakers should do it. We already have Bynum and Gasol so why would we need Shaq. Shaq is a great player but it wouldn't work out for the Lakers.|`|25dae56825b91363788a0a201af05595aa	Heeeeeelll no!    You've got ******* Bynum, AND Gasol, and you want Shaq???     WTF?    Odom is a solid 6th man, which is hard to find!!

It's going to be a wrap for the rest of the contenders... Although I think the Lakers can still get it done without Shaq.. Check this trade out!|`|Kf1i1JGDaa	I think that it would be incredibly stupid to trade Lamar Odom for Shaq. As you probably already know the Lakers just traded Vladimir for Adam Morrison andShannon Brown. Now they are considering trading Lamar Odom, Chris Minh, and D.J. for Shaq. I would never trade these players for Shaq. Especially not Lamar and Chris.
wnZ0N3wjaa	Hopefully they dont tell Smith too much =]    On another note, Phil Hughes is in awesome form at the moment plundering 230 odd runs in his previous match and is the 2nd leading run-scorer in the Sheffield Shield, Bryce McGain has just come back from injury but he did pick up wickets in his last match while Marcus North is a handy all rounder batting at 6 and bowling his offies.|`|AA11088802	i think that happened when SA goes to Aus|`|k2y36hPkaa	If Warne or Berry can give some info on these newish players that would be great!

AA12182122	~If you are planning to tryout to throw the discus, running marathons won't help much.  If you plan to try to run distances, wind sprints won't help.  If you want to run sprints, bench pressing 25 reps at 250 isn't going to do you much good.      It depends on your event and a lot of other things.  In any case, if you want to do well at your chosen event, the key is warm up first, then PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE.  Until it hurts.  The push a little more.  Then cool down properly.    If all else fails, you could always ask your prospective coach (or your gym teacher) to give you a workout regimen.  I ran the 100 and 200.  I'd generally do about 5 or 10 400s to warm up, then I'd work on getting out of the blocks for awhile and go maybe 20 or 30 meters.  After 20 or 25 reps, I'd do half a dozen wind sprints at 100.  After walking a few laps, I'd do some 200s, then mix some 400s with 100s.  I'd do about 1 1/2 to 2 hrs a session.   I'm not saying the routine helped me get to the states, but it didn't hurt.  It also didn't hurt that I had a runners frame and legs.   I only used weights a couple times a week, generally leg lifts with between 75 and 150 pounds, or squats with 100.    I really don't think a treadmill will do you much good unless you plan on running serious distances, like at least 5k.  And yes, diet and rest are important.  Take at least 1, if not 2, days off per week.  And work on your running posture and gait.|`|gGRccjlVaa	it depends how heavy u r   first of all eat meat  some people eat candy before they run which gives them a boost but then later expect crash...|`|nBayWj8Faa	Lifting light weights (maybe ? of your body weight) probably couldn't hurt.     Alternating exercise and rest days is your best bet. So, maybe three days a week of good, solid, intense workout followed by a day of rest should be fine.    Be SURE you see a doctor first. Undiagnosed heart or.blood sugar issues will put you in the grave. DON'T think you're too young for that to happen.    Also, remember that if you start feeling dizzy to stop what you're doing or your body will do that for you. You really don't want that.    I hope this all helps. Good luck and bring home the big one!|`|ycNt74yyaa	Give yourself one day of rest a week. Also, Eat c-l-e-a-n. The rest allows your body to heal. It will create stamina and power.

xsCIdBCmaa	maldini is the legend for Italy. one of the best defender that italy ever have. that match will become very good match to dismiss maldini from his football career.     MALDINI you're the legend we'll miss u when u haven't played football again....|`|0pMdqEnaaa	He is still and still a great player. He will perform very good I must say because Legends are always legends. I think hes not playing against Brazil but some other country that's for sure before he ends his career.

He is going to do well when ever he plays for Italia.|`|QUIrETvAaa	This is thanks to Goal.com's campaign to honour one of the greatest defenders, Italy have ever experienced. I personally believe this is a fantastic idea to celebrate what has certainly been one great career.

(Although I am quite fond of Davide Santon)    Forza Nerazzurri for life.|`|VpiYSQVnaa	from what i understand, Maldini has agreed to play a final match with the Azzurri, however Lippi has already confirmed that he will not be playing in the friendly against Brazil. In whatever match he does play in, I think it's a wonderful idea and the perfect way to end his career and i'm sure he feels the same way.|`|c4GykfVkaa	He's a great player and I hope they'll win the match. BTW, when will it take place ?|`|ipznrSQyaa	Maldini is a great player that nevers give up. He is valuable because of his courage and resistance. He is very good attacking and defending.

In late November, Tomko reportedly resigned a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment: His first match back in the company was a dark match before the December 15 episode of Raw in a winning effort over Paul Burchill. However, he competed in the match with an injury and was taken off the road in order to heal. After recovering, Tomko began wrestling dark matches again.|`|zhH36xEHaa	Lol, I just got Rick roll'd!

QQyWUDI8aa	WHY DOES EVERYONE HATE MAT COME ON IT IS JUST THE "STORYLINES" PERSONA LY I LIKE MATT HARDY HE IS STRAIGHT UP WITH PEOPLE BUT THERE STILL IS THE HARDY BOYS SO THATS WHAT I THINK       I WANT XP TO LOOK LIKE MAC HAS JUST TALKED IM OUT|`|7f2GSDmqaa	I like him as a heel. He's much better that way, since as a face he was getting very stale and boring|`|hL3eS2zKaa	You shouldnt hate him, it was kayfabe. Didnt you see the look on his face when he said "Jeff, I no longer consider you as my partner, and I no longer consider you, my brother"? It looked like it was torture for him to say that.    I think his heel turn is finally going somewhere. But I before I learned it was fake, I hated him too. But remember, he would never do that to Jeff, I bet you a million dollars that he's somewhere right now having a beer with Jeff and laughing about it. It was scripted, he actually hit Jeff, but not from cold-blood. Wrestlers have to learn how to take a chair shot to the head. But remember, Matt wouldnt do that to him. :-)|`|PyJ3PMRnaa	Same here.|`|qt7QcmtPaa	i love matt and jeff hardy. its just a storyline trust me. in real life matt wouldnt just randomly go turn on jeff. matts awesome and loves his younger bro. and on smackdown when he was talking about jeff he has to keep stopping. the was choking up, u could tell he didnt want to be saying all that stuff.|`|mJvZhdAuaa	I'm a huge fan of Matt Hardy, I have been for, it seems, forever.  He has done so much, he innovated the Twist of Fate, and he was 1 of 6 people to be in the first TLC match, ever!  Hardy is living his dream, and is doing so responsibly, he has taken care of Jeff (on-screen, rescuing him during matches, and off-screen, taking him in after his home burnt), he dropped out of college where he had a full ride scholarship so he could be home with his ill father, and is an inspiration to many, many people.  As far as what he did to Jeff, that was storyline, get over it.  Shane and Stephanie have turned on each other before, hell, both Shane and Stephanie have wrestled their own father at WWE ppvs.  Triple H and Shawn Michaels have been described as "as close as brothers," by some people, but yet they have had some of the bloodiest matches the WWE has ever had.     So, I like Matt Hardy not only for what he has done professionally, but in his personal life as well.  I judge Matt by who Matt is, in entirety, not by what the Creative Department at WWE came up with for him.|`|AA10731562	I HATE that idiot matt. hits his own bro with a steel chair . WHAT A LOOZA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|gispvL2aaa	I like it, Matt is technically the better wrestler, Jeff just did all the high flying flashy stuff.  Like em both tho|`|gVCZlEPIaa	That was  brutal for whacking him with the steel chair like that. You don't do that to a brother in the first place.|`|mDuiiVN7aa	Matt is a good person in real life, he loves his younger brother. And his turn is just a story line, it has nothing to do with the real life.    Matt should be a great heel, hopefully this direction will lift up his career to new heights, he is much deserving of. Matt has a great heart for wrestling but was newer recognized by Vince, that is SAD.|`|25dae56825b91363788a0a201af05595aa	The only reason you hate him is because he turned on Jeff.
cvNdVDMiaa	I have been playing high school lacrosse for 3 years already, and for the months when I am not playing lacrosse or working, I am woefully inactive. So, I've had to get into shape around 3 times, the fourth time started yesterday. So far, at least for me, this method has worked.  You don't want to strain, and then injure yourself, so don't begin with an intense workout regimen. Take it slowly at first, like a mile or two every other day for about a week. Then, begin building up your endurance by doing more distance. Lacrosse is mostly sprinting, so it's a good idea to try to do ladders/suicides at full speed as far as you can go. Just push yourself past the limit. After you do this for about two weeks, and you'll definitely notice a difference in your breathing capacity and ability to run without getting out of breath. It's also a good idea to lift weights occasionally (maybe 2-3 times a week), and stretch EVERY night. (The stretching is especially important, because it increases flexibility, and prevents spraining and soreness.) [Just do all of this until the season starts.]  Also, since you're a freshman and haven't played a sport in about five years, I'd recommend finding somebody who already knows how to play show you the basics (shooting, passing, defending, the different positions and rules of the game).  You can also bounce a ball off of the wall, if you have nobody to pass with, which helps a lot. Once you get good enough, you can try switching to your non-dominant hand to practice.  Also, don't be afraid to approach the coach at your school. Usually they can't begin coaching until the season officially starts, but I'm sure the coach would be happy to find a varsity player to help you out.|`|1FTFCtaNaa	start running about a mile every day and then start runnning a little more and doing sprints. Also throw the ball against the wall with both hands to get better.|`|4YObAmyGaa	Run and run get you lungs used to oxyegen of pain you will be inhailing  run   run   run more every single day   start out 5 minutes   then 10   and keep going until you are about 60 minutes a day  eat fruits and eat a lot of protien|`|JpXiKJ8Aaa	Honestly, most people play either all sports or no sports that way they are physically fit for all of their sports and all year. Thats what I do volleybal then basketball then track and field.

gGRccjlVaa	just do like a hand stand and flipover!!!here how:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7Z_BOnxS...|`|aDKVJJ7Maa	First of all, do this in a gym with someone who is qualified to help you, please. :)    All right. You can break a front handspring down into a few steps:  1. Running start/ hurdle. In your hurdle, it is important that you take about three big steps, and on the third step, your knee (right knee, if you're a righty) goes up, like you're going to knee someone in the chin (this slightly violent visualization was brought to you by my coach.) When you start to hurdle, pull your arms up so that they are hugging your ears. The tighter you hold your arms, the easier it will be to "pop" in your handspring.    2. From your hurdle, reach and throw yourself into a handstand. Make sure that you're hitting handstand with straight legs.     3. Push off the ground with your hands. This is where the popping comes in. The tighter you have your shoulders, the better you will pop off of your hands and into the handspring.     4. Arch through your handspring. Make sure that you're watching your hands (it will help with your arch.)    5. Land with bent knees and arms up by your ears. You should have enough momentum to force you to run forward in order to keep your balance. Imagine that you are being pulled up and forward from your belly button.     Drills, etc to help you out:     Handstand pops: To do a handstand pop, go into handstand with tight shoulders and practice popping off of your hands.    Backbends: Practicing backbends, bridges, or any other skill that requires back flexibility will help you arch in your front handspring. Make sure that you always arch through your shoulders so that your lower spine doesn't absorb all of the pressure.    I recommend that you use gymnastics barrels if you have any available to you. You also may want to practice on a trampoline. Personally, I find front handsprings on tramp incredibly frustrating, but many people find that practicing on tramp helps them with their technique.    Good luck with your front handsprings and varsity! Hope I helped!

ZTwGmiwwaa	you would have to do a lot more classes. it can take people monthes just to get a back handspring. you must have a back handspring before you can get a back or front tuck. and you need a lot of abb strength to do tucks and handsprings so you need to learn how to get up from your backbend. i suggest you get your walkovers first though. it will be alot easier to do handsprings and tucks if you have those. i think if you tried really hard you could have your handsprings by April. if you really committed yourself and did more than one class a week you might be able to get your tucks. but once again this depends on your athletic abilities. good luck (:|`|4E14gkmKaa	No way.|`|UOZGLCfNaa	u have to be able to do a back handspring before u can do a front and back flip. it took me 2 months to do a back handspring so good luck plus y do you need to learn it by april oh you can learn a front and back flip on a trampoline
2ZcEepyAaa	They will drop in the standings a little, maybe more then we all expect. I am a huge Duke fan and i was soo dissapointed in the loss. I mean Clemson...really....i know they are usually good but come on. Coach K will tell them that they need to get there act togeather before the big Duke vs. UNC game. They will probably slip to  7 around there. I bet that coach k does not care about what ranking he is in right now. He especially does not want to be at  1. Everyone looks to beat  1 so he would probably perfer not to be at that seed. He will start to care towards the end of the season to get that top 4 seed for the NCAA tourney.|`|Z0AE7eHiaa	They didn't just lose, they were decimated. Booker blocked and dunked on every blue devil that played last night. Duke should have to go to the bottom of the rankings and work their way back up after this showing.    Irregardless they will still likely get a  1 seed because of name recognition. I hope the selection committee places them in our bracket so we can get our lickings in too in the elite eight game.    edit    to Dr. Love,    It is no secret that louisville is a poor shooting team and relies heavily on the inside game which the 7'4" monster at UConn succesfully took away from us. I don't see any giants on dukes team and they too will get dunked on when they play the cardinals, just like ND, WVU, Pitt, Syracuse, Villanova and anyone else that has a center avering less than 4 blocks a game. The fact of the matter is that duke has not beaten a top 25 team outside of cameron indoor this season.|`|0gWxnY0Gaa	Sit and sulk until they play Carolina, think they r gonna win, and get KILLED by the Tarheels!    Ranking: Where Tarheels r now, which is like  6  Title Contenders:No freakin way!  Do well for the rest of the season: Maybe, maybe not, pretty much no!|`|fuYYRJXtaa	They drop big... But hopefully that embarrassing loss motivate them to step up their defense & win against non-ranked teams!!|`|gkSfxNQJaa	i think that they have a chance to make it to the elite eight|`|6fl7RrJMaa	As much as I hate Duke I have to say that theyre a great team. Of course theyre gonna drop  bit in the rankings but they will be contenders all the way through the season. Should be atleast an elite eight team.         GO UNC!!!!!!!|`|GmYM3CLwaa	I belive duke should not feel embarsed for a 20 game win streak against clemson that snapped it happens alot to good teams, but they have to know heres still many more games left and just have to get their heads straightened together and gear up.|`|UIi7B3UDaa	to the Louisville fan, they got TRASHED by UCONN at HOME, Louisville has like 4 or 5 losses already, some against bad teams, DUKE lost to Michigan,Wake,And Clemson.all were at least in the top 25    To answer the question DUKE just needs to get back to basics

NXktxy8jaa	Im going on a limb and choosing Kurt Angle. Sting has been ignoring the actions of The Main Event Mafia lately and I think that The Main Event Mafia will help out Kurt Angle in this match allowing him to win the title. Because of this, Sting will leave The Mafia and possibly join The Frontlines. I Can't see Bubba Ray or D-Von winning the title that fast even though they decided to pursue singles careers.|`|PsGNDuJ8aa	I hope its Sting as i want him to keep the title for longer but there is a chance it will be Kurt Angle.

AvxMhVGmaa	I know that game is at the AT&T Center, and if you look for tickets to that game in the lower lever, you will find that those tickets are sold out! So I think that if you are going to pay $200 for both, that's is a good deal. If you are going to pay $200 each that is $400. I think is too much, the seller is making a good profit with your money.

1jmXT4Vvaa	I shoot an x7 with a e grip.  I have it turned up to 20 bps.  I have never had any problems at all.  I would blame the paint.  It might be the barrel as well.  I hate flatlines.  Tried one on my x7 and returned it the next day.  Loud, inaccurate, and hard to clean.  The same can be said about the apex, only it is more accurate when you dial the spin off.  I have switched to the freak barrel and couldn't be happier.  The one day I did use the flatline, it never caused a barrel break, though.  Try the stock barrel first, if you still break paint, its the paint, if you don't, its the barrel.|`|QTd8MVDjaa	The flatline is very picky about paint. I've heard only expensive paintballs like Marbs will work well with it. It's probably not the R/T's fault because it's breaking in the barrel, not the actual gun. I would try to buy some really nice paint and test it with that. The A5 isn't made to shoot real fast, so I would take it easy and shoot slow when testing the more expensive paintballs. Or take the paint you usually use and test it on your gun with the stock or a regular type barrel on it. If the paint isn't breaking with a regular barrel, it's the flatline.|`|iErG6IToaa	Your chopping paint and that is not good for the gun. It could be crappy paint, but any "ACS" for a mech gun is gona chop paint if your shootin like crazy. I'm not sayin tippmann makes bad guns but they are kinda like the AK-47 and will shoot with anything which is a good thing. But, where you loose is accuracy and cleaning your gun. Also tippmanns are heavy and alot slower then electric guns. I would suggest checking the barrel size and ball size because barrels and balls do come in different sizes. I would also suggest looking into "speed ball guns". A spyder electra, and vs2 will be better and cheaper. Lighter, faster, more accurate, and probably won't chop as much because of laser sensors within the gun called eyes. A much better gun that is about $100 more than the spyders and about the same as the X7 is a smart parts Ion. The ion, electra, and vs2 are gona be automatic, more air efficient, and more upgradable (no props tho).    PS: "woods ball guns" are gona last longer and probably wont break when you hit it off of something, but i can almost garuntee that "speed ball guns" can hold up to what even the roughest player can dish out.

The Heat only have one player that can get his own shot and be a playmaker (chalmers is more of a shooter than playmaker). I think Miller would be excellent as a high post and low post option. He'd be a great pick and pop guy for wade and is one of the best passing big men in the game. Plus it allows them to move Beasley to the starting 3 where I think hes best suited. Then you start miller and haslem as the bigs and give more minutes to james jones. For Sacramento, Marion fits their free uptempo style of play. They can trade Salmons for a pick or young player and give more minutes to Hawes at center.
q0rDcTSRaa	I think you should run the pick & roll with you and the PG on the team to throw off their defense. I also think you should stay out of foul trouble in this game, don't yell at the ref's just keep playing.     Focus on defense-I don't know how good you guys are on defense but defense wins championships.    Force their best player to shoot jump shots-Whoever is your teams best perimeter defender is should be guarding the opponents best player.    Good Luck|`|fcWpaUnWaa	Try to attack the basketball early in the game and hopefully that will open up your game.|`|A0JEBnnWaa	Milk the clock.  Do what you can to stay close in the first half and try not to get worn out - spread the offense and play a zone defense (man-to-man will get you tired with lack of a bench).  Also, substitute often and early, it will keep your team more fresh and could frustrate the other team.|`|l0iCqzlQaa	i used to have a mercedes.

XnhJZQvfaa	If you really want to improve your Vertical jump, first you need to figure out what type of Jumper you are, a power jumper or a leaper, as using optimal biomechanics is just as important as having explosive muscle power. Next you need to figure out what type of power or strength you are lacking. The three basic types of strength are: Base strength, transitional power, and explosiveness or "Reactive" power, they are all different and must be trained in different ways. Now I know a lot of you are wondering what's the difference between the three. Well in short Base Strength is how much weight you can move, Transitional Power is how fast you can move said weight and explosiveness is the maximum speed and distance you can move said weight with each single movement. A good Vertical Jump training routine will include the following exercises:    Base Strength   1: Traditional Squats and Pistol Squats   2: Deadlifts/base building olympic lifts   3: Lunges   4: Core Work (Functional Performance Core Strength= The ability to make your pelvis and spine "lock" and work as a single stable unit, not simply having a 6 pack or being able to do 100 crunches)   5: Stretching    Transitional Power:   1: Box Squats/Tempo Squats   2: Power Cleans   3: Push Press   4: Core Work   5: Stretching    Explosiveness:   1: Ballistic and jump squats   2: Traditional and Compound/Hybrid Plyometrics   3: Sprinting   4: Core Work   5: Stretching    You'll also want to figure out which individual muscles/muscle groups are working inefficiently. You can figure this out by completing a full vertical jump test progression and a baseline fitness test to diagnose any muscle imbalances that you may have. Remember no matter what type of training program you do you must make sure that opposing muscles are strengthened and balanced (e.g. Quads and hamstrings, abs and lower back) so don't skip the quad extensions and hamstring curls. If opposing muscles are not strengthened they will lead to weak links, energy leaks and imbalances will result in poor poor or slow improvement and raise the risk of injury significantly. Do a routine that combines plyomertic/bodyweight, free weight and or acceleration routines. Make sure you are consuming lots of protein to aid in muscle repair after tough workouts You'll also want to replenish your bodies ATP and glycogen stores as they are the fuel for those type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers you will be (AKA FG and FOG) shredding during your workout. In order to gain inches you'll need to tax your central nervous system and force your body to create new motor pathways. If you train correctly you should gain at least an inch a week. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTy...    Jump 20 inches higher in 10 weeks:  http://www.program51.com|`|BGcSbdFNaa	Your question is kind of general, but i ll try to include as much as possible.    Jumping high is a matter of power, speed and technique. I'm going to help you with the first 2 aspects. Technique is something that differs from one to the other and needs personal help and observation by a coach on the spot.    Enchancing strength and speed entails fast twitch muscle fibers exercising. That will be achieved by explosive plyometric workouts, like depth jumps, squat hops, thrust ups and more. Backward sprints, deadlifts and reverse toe raise are the KEY workouts of the whole program. What happens is... For every contraction a muscle makes an oposing muscle must lengthen. Take the biceps for example, as you contract it, the tricpes must lengthen. The key is not to strengthen the muscles that we normally associate with increasing our vertical jump like the calf muscle or quad muscles, but to strengthen their opossing muscles like the shin muscles and hamstrings. The reason for this is the major jumping muscles will not produce their max capable power unless they know their oposite muscle is strong enough to handle it - If your oposite muscles can't handle the opposing muscles power they would simply lengthen to much and SNAP!    So, here is some good drills to execute with sets and reps prescribed. If you see that after weeks, you can perform them more easily, start to add reps easy. Add 3-6 reps every 1-2 weeks and after adding about 15 reps, make a new  set.    a)Step ups - Get a chair and ensure it will remain stable(e.g.put it against a wall). Begin with one thigh on the chair parallel to the ground. With all of your strength, push off of the elevated leg and leap off of the chair as high as you can. Crisscross or switch your legs in the air. Land with the opposite leg elevated in the chair as in step 1. Repeat the procedure until you are back to step 1. This completes 1 repetition. (3 sets x 12 reps)  b)Burnouts - Elevated as high as you possible can on your tiptoes to assure that you work the high end of your calves. As quickly as you possibly can, jump repeatedly no more than 1/2 to 1 inch off of the ground making sure to keep yourself elevated as high on your tiptoes as possible ensuring that you are working the upper calf muscles. (2 sets x 200 reps)  c)Calf raises - step on a book or stair step one legged standing on toes, heel below the step, raise yourself up only with your calf, (4 sets x 20 reps)  d)Leap ups - bend down to a 1/4 squat position and jump back into the air to a minimum of 8 to 10 inches, (3 sets x 15 reps)  e)Thrust ups - Begin with your legs straight, thrust (bounce) yourself up as high as you possibly can and when come back down you thrust at once back up trying not to bend your legs. (5 sets x 20 reps)  f)Squat hops - Squat down into a sitting position while hugging a ball for balance.Make sure that you are looking straight ahead, with your back straight,  that you are elevated on the balls of your feet (half tiptoed) and most importantly that your thighs are parallel to the ground. Hop or bounce in the seated position between 3-5 inches per hop. (3 sets x 12 reps)  g)Depth jumps(maybe the most important exercise) - Get a chair or a box and ensure it will remain stable. Watch the cushioning. Get on the chair (2 to 3 feet high), drop off with both feet and as soon as you land, explosively jump back into the air. (4 sets x 10 reps)  Do not overtrain. Do not train two days in a row. This will cause an injury or a burnout which will leave you behind.. If you feel any strain or sharp pain in the first days, stop at once, massage, ice and stretch the particular muscle group.  Warming up, stretching and cooling down is of the utmost importance.    In different days, you will perform the following "reverse training" session.  a)Deadlifts(barbell or dumbells needed) - Stand with feet about hip-distance apart and hold weights in front of thighs. Keeping the shoulders back, abs in and the back straight, tip from the hips and lower the weights towards the floor. Lower as far as your flexibility allows. Lift bar by extending hips and knees to full extension. Pull shoulders back at top of lift if rounded. Push into the heel to go back to starting position.  b)Reverse toe raise - Grasp dumbbell in one hand to side. Position heels on forward edge of platform. Grasp support with other hand for balance. Pull the forefoot of both feet up toward body as far as possible. Return by extending feet until toes are pointed downward. Repeat. Keep knees and hips straight throughout exercise.  c)Backward sprints - Just sprint going backwards. Try to push yourself using the ball and toes of your feet. Keep knees high.|`|HiuNSScLaa	bend ur knees and spring them up the harder you try the higher u go

BiMkowVMaa	No excuses... at least not from me. it just means we lost a regular season game.    I don't get why you say all Laker fans though. Yeah some are delusional, but not all.    I just want the game to be competitive.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	True Laker fans won't.|`|WZvny7mMaa	I won't. If we lose tonight I won't give excuses. That would mean that the Celtics just played better. I believe giving excuses is for sore losers. Although I have to admit some fans will.|`|Xcd8ZGu3aa	Nah|`|XLv4hhAnaa	No Bynum is the excuse.|`|IAnT8aGsaa	Probebly, but even with bynum, celtics will sweep the lakers 137-91|`|EKF2HdZKaa	only some fans....|`|YrXXh9ltaa	yes    but the players will act as if it shouldn't have mattered even though bynum is the **** and they all know it    kobe for life is an idiot up there, without bynum kobe would think that he is the team and has to take every shot, like he has been lately|`|FUoKu13Daa	there is always an excuse for losing,    if the lakers lose tonight then people will say if Bynum was playing then we would have won,    If the celtics lose then they probably will say because KG did not play or he still did not feel well,    in either case injury and sickness is part of the game so live with it.|`|ExVTrokAaa	of course NOT!    most Laker fans don't make excuses like YOU ROCKETS FANS do!    Rocket Fans-"umm umm i still believe that a healthy Rocket team will beat the Lakers in a series and go to the finals"|`|2ZcEepyAaa	Yes. I am not a Lakers fan, i am a celtics fan but listen to these guys after they lost in the Finals. That is all you heard out of them. " Its because Bynum wasnt there.......Lakers would have destoryed the celtics if Bynum was there.....so on so on......" its what these laker fans live for. Making excuses to why they lost to the Boston Celtics. I bet in the Bird era, that is all you heard as well. I know that every fan has to make excuses of why they lost, i do it too, but not to the extent that the Lakers fans do. They say they wont use it as an excuse, but they will. TRUST ME.........|`|kFcdwVwdaa	to be honest with you its the dumb *** bandwagoners who say all that stupid ****. they will just say or repeat whatever the media says, we true fans know how good the celtics are and how physical they are and if they beat then so be it another loss in our column boo hoo. big deal, just like when the celtics lost on xmas wow ok another loss lets keep going. thats all that happens.   the media will first say that we needed bynum to win and then you are going to hear it from all the b-wagoners.|`|wWLcOn40aa	no i'm a lakers fan and if they lose i'll just say that we did not do our best!!!!|`|BGcSbdFNaa	Why would they make an excuse?  this isn't even that big of a game so it doesn't matter its the regular season save excuses for the playoffs.|`|7t7XzXsVaa	well it's an excuse just like lebron if hes injured the reason cavs lose is cause lebrons injured that the similarity except lebron better|`|3teWTOPqaa	We are not physical enough, that's our excuse.

Also phil wont play kobe|`|YrXXh9ltaa	Referring to when the cavs will play boston:    yah. do as the lakers did on christmas. it should work since the cavs have an even better bench than LA did in that game. if mo and the gaurds can pull through and play well, the cavs should be fine     by the way mike is the coach of the cavs|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Hahahaha at MC!!    I don't know about the entire 48 minutes, but he should wear them out! I'm still pissed that Ray Allen is going to the All-Star game, instead of Mo Williams.|`|8sqOVMvNaa	yeah i agree  i was at EVERY atlanta home playoff game last year    gotta be physical with KG like ZaZa was in Game 4    gotta stop Pierce like Joe Johnson did     Gotta gaurd the perimeter like Mike Bibby did on Ray Allen    thats what MY HAWKS  did in last years home playoff games    but it didnt work in Boston lol    but LeBron vs. Pierce should be a great matchup i see LeBron getting the best of him just bc LeBron has been on fire and when he gets like this NO STOPPING him  just like Kobe    but sooner or later the "Big Three" will get wore out|`|EKF2HdZKaa	Lol great idea!  i wonder is phil jackson will wear out tony and tim...|`|7t7XzXsVaa	lol but Mike Brown would not do that cause he could get suspended from that if they find out the reason. We can still own celtics anyways.|`|khbLZQHIaa	Yes.  Yes.  Yes!    Great idea!    Seriously, that should kinda play into Coach Brown's plans for the game.  No joke.    It should only be 2 out of 3 of the Big Three though.... Mo really deserved that spot....
fuYYRJXtaa	Lakers are the underdog since they play on the road... And without Bynum.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	well according to betting its boston....|`|bPnmavjZaa	Without Bynum, Boston should definently be favored|`|8sqOVMvNaa	Boston  only because there playing the the Garden    Nuetral Court=LA favored probaly|`|uj6v5MWBaa	boston because of bynum's big injury AGAIN|`|2ZcEepyAaa	Boston is. Bynum is out. The Celtics dominated the Lakers in the playoffs last year and they had the same squad that they will have on the court tonight. The Celtics will be looking to dominate them tonight after the Lakers snapped there 19 game win streak on Xmas. Garnett is also expected to be back tonight, and if the Celtics can win without him, they can deffently win with him as well. It will be an excellent game, tune in.    GO CELTICS!!!|`|AA11017423	According to me I think Boston should have the edge over the Lakers because of looking at their impressive home record but we're talking about the lakers here who came off two game win streak plus 61points from Kobe who surpassed Micheal Jordan on the all time list and have a chance against them!|`|Zo0QMB8xaa	Boston
tY3rZSsiaa	this turned out extremely horrible for the sixers, i dont see them wanting to keep brand, but no one would want him and his contract.|`|fuYYRJXtaa	They had hope.    Eventually he's out for the rest of the season.|`|6e2c3f79b5d1c7c11ce3cfa9d37906e4aa	he is a great player, and Iggy was threatening to leave. He is just having a horrible injury plagued season.    next year for him.|`|HDbMh2YBaa	I dont know where you get on calling Brand injury prone. He hasnt faced many injuries and last year's injury was the longest he ever was out. While he was healthy he was averaging close to a double double as well.     Another thing is the 76ers would be garbage without Brand. The 76ers stink so bad because they dont have any shooting threats. This makes it hard on post players like Brand because players can cheat and not worry about paying for it.     The 76ers need shooters since they rank last in 3 pters made. I think their lack of shooting ability is hurting Brand's production. Right now they have a fast pace style mostly about getting easy buckets and layups while forcing turnovers. However their halfcourt game stinks because of lack of shooting ability.     Brand could be a run and gun guy but you need shooters to play that sort of game. Get the 76ers some shooters and they should be fine. So he's out for the year huh? Must be new news. Thats sad for the 76ers then.|`|n6514FLVaa	retarded to the max!|`|KZOB5cghaa	me and my fellow sixers fans expected talent coming from brand....we have seen him as nothing but a 7th man if that.....we play much better w/o him and i am actually glad he is out and hope we get rid of him......and dont hate on philly sports you fag|`|aaKYVMk2aa	It really wasn't the management's fault. Brand at that time was a force, maybe not a dominant force, but still one of the better big men. Who knew, that he would be trash and get injured so easily now in Philly? Give him a little more time.    I still think it was foolish he tried to played through his injury though, what's the rush? Now look what happened.

He wants out of Phoenix and he's looking at Toronto, Washington, Chicago, New York & Miami. Personally, I would like to see him go to Toronto.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	New York knicks or some other team in the East. No way Kerr trades to a team in the west. Kerr is an idiot, but he won't go that far.|`|50bEHtYfaa	we need him to come to washington!!!!|`|csKyqot0aa	Maybe Dallas or Miami?|`|XLv4hhAnaa	I don't think so.|`|wuDplG1qaa	When you learn grammar.|`|IAnT8aGsaa	Possibly toronto or miami, I heard maybe knicks but i doubt it|`|AvxMhVGmaa	To New York, and join D'Antonio.|`|uj6v5MWBaa	I'd like to see him go to the Bulls    they need the most help inside|`|qq1fSV2daa	miami would be awesome .. but they would probably have to give up alot to get him .. as long as beasley and wade stay i'm happy .. i'd say they'd have to trade marion and haslem for him|`|dDhTMacAaa	Well, Dallas will have more cap room after Kidd's contract expires at season's end, but according to reports, Amare is on the block now after things in Phoenix went downhill. Clearly a sad situation for Amare, even Nash, and others because they want to run, and the Coach (Porter) and GM (Kerr) want to use Shaq most of the time and slow it down.    Amare, I believe, has the option to opt out at season's end or enter the free agent market the season after which seems less likely in most analyst's eyes, so he could be a rental, which noone wants.    I think possible options are:  - Toronto  - Dallas  - Portland (less likely)  - Miami (attractive option)|`|6Efhd6lNaa	I dont think Phx will trade him. Even if they are struggling he is just too good and too young to let go.|`|BGcSbdFNaa	I dont think so with that contract also he is getting paid alot and teams are saving up for kobe etc so no i dont think he will be traded but alot of crap can happen in a weeks time. He also has a lot of stock meaning that his trade value is gonna be too high and teams most likely wont want to trade their 1st or 2nd pick and a superstar hes really young too so that helps out phoenix and hes a superstar in the end Phoenix decides his fate until hes a free agent he has no say whatsoever.

661f4675fd3e48dcb06c904c410644daaa	Hmmm your quartebacks are the tough decision in my mind, but i'd play Romo in a shootout against the falcons terrible secondary. Hasslebeck is going to be without D>JAX, and they have a short week (play on thurs.). Tom Brady has not been tom brady of old, and can not be considered a must start anymore ( 8ints-6 tds last 6 wks) , his line and recievers just areNOT what they were the last few years. Maybe he'll bounce back against a terrible team like the texans, but i think i'd rather wait and see with him. Romo has a good match-up, a better line , and way better recivers, Start Romo.    Start Bush , he is finally showing us all the potential we knew he had, wahington has a good Run D, but terrible Pass D, and we all know what reggie does best!  Another reason is that the Saints still have something to play for, while the Packers are done, and you may see more and more Morency,  as a result.    Wide Reciever- Start Johnson and Henderson.  Johnson will likely be the focal point for the texans next week,  I expect the texans to be forced to throw to him ALOT.   Start- Henderson, because Horn is hurting still pretty bad, and henderson has played well the last 6 or 7 weeks.  Drew Brees has the uncanny ability to make stars out of any reciever, and henderson is a prime example, play him!    Sit Moss, campbell can't get him the ball.    Sit Evans, Miami's Defense is very very good, third i'd say behind the bears and ravens. But Evans is another decent play because he will probably get alot of looks .    Good Luck!|`|4b7a1d3375158a38235c966ee7c970adaa	Brady is your main at QB; everyone puts up points on the Texans.    Bush is playing awesome and plays in lots of situations; he'll find the endzone more than Green and also gets all the receiving points for catches.    Go with Andres Johnson and Henderson as your WR; Moss and Evans are big play only guys.  Evans will not get a sniff this week against a tough Miami defense.|`|41a325ac3c7e9a44f30b472dfc86b4beaa	Romo  Green  Johnson - Henderson (i hate Moss...can't stand the 30 one week and 7 the next week)      good luck|`|c4b1b88fcf64c724d941069d9544891caa	Hasselback  Bush  Lee Evans|`|7497f7be7e0fda7dd55a633c697f0d23aa	QB- easily Tom Brady. Romo is hot, but ATL is good... Hasselbeck can't handle SF... and HOU has no pass rush. Easy money. Tom Brady of NWE.    RB- Depends... Do you want to win? Ahman Green will only run about 10 times before DET obliterates GB. Bush should rack up 120 rec yds, 1 TD. Not great for RB, but better than "Ah, man I lost" Green.    WR- Santana Moss is majorly hit or miss... Lee Evans is a weak play, he'll be MIA this week... Henderson is a weak play with Colston healthy again... AJ is a must start. Go with Santana Moss against an average NO secondary and hope he gets bombs.    Good luck, hope I don't mess you up.|`|4966f7f51a268843dc7cbb355558e7baaa	start Brady he can carry a team out of the dark when things get a little tuff a besides he has supper bowl rings on his fingers for RB Green he has experince and has good break away speed WR Santana Moss hes the mann to count on

Si es por su contribucin a la Educacin, River tiene una escuela secundaria donde se cursa el Bachillerato con orientacin deportiva y sus ttulos son oficiales.

This season he's been playing more unselfish team ball being that he has one to use, and right when Bynum gets hurt the next night he goes and drops 61 letting us know the beast still lives inside of him. Sure LeBrons a godly athlete and can drive at will, yet his rebounds and assists can be credited to the lack of team and the fact he is always touching the ball. He still shot 2-7 for three (one being a half courter at the buzzer) and poor from free throws. Those threes are unnecassary. The knicks couldnt stop him all night why not drive those possesions instead of pulling up? Just doesnt have the right mind set to be the best yet...    suchi T is ridiculous.. the aged all star team of payton and mailman that lost to one of the best defensive teams of the decade in a well coached (larry brown) and ben wallace and rasheed playing well is no way to compare the two.. kobes numbers may be worse but hes been in a rougher west with a team to pass and rebound around him.. thats ridiculous.|`|F3gt6Tjlaa	This is actually an opinion question, But since u want us to answers your question, I will go with Lebron, in the past? yeah, kobe was better, but Lebron is actually having better stats and also, is doing pretty much the same thing with less help from his teammates if we talk about team record, so, overall Lebron is better.

The Lakers (payton, kobe, mailman, shaq) could not beat the pistons(ben wallace, rasheed wallace, billups, hamilton, prince)The Lakers had to cheat to acquire Gasol... so Kobe would stop being a crybaby... he couldn't get past the first round against the suns and didnt make the playoff one year...

Si analizamos lo que Hugol ha declarado, hay muchas cosas ciertas. Hay que tener mentalidad de campen. Basta con saber de que nadie que quiere que triunfe mxico seria capaz de echarse la chambota que esto trae consigo. Es decir, alguien que pelea el puesto de DT, es porque quiere dejar marca en ese puesto, de otra manera de que le servira. Hugol es Hugol pese a quien le pese, y si quera tanto el puesto es porque har todo lo que este a su alcance, pero tambin debemos tomar en cuenta que tambin tiene que ver mucho en los jugadores, por que si despus sale un Omar bravo, que sale de labiscon queriendo tirar penales y los falla, la culpa no es del DT.|`|a46ab4664b553bc9f67db1e6360d9b26aa	Por el bien del futbol mexicano ojala qu s, pero siendo realista, no creo que Hugo vaya a trascender en la seleccin.

61e448fc5245b744f6744c2a5cec05fbaa	Me parece muy bien que los equipos mexicanos jueguen las copas de sudamerica tanto la libertadores como la sudamericana porque sus equipos estan al nivel de los equipos brasilero,argentino,uruguayo,chileno,el nivel de la concacaf es muy bajo,ademas le quiero contestar al que escribio que para los mundiales si jugaran en sudamerica clasificarian facilmente,no lo creo,mexico no gano ningun mundial,y hoy esta detras deportivamente de las selecciones de brasil,argentina,uruguay,colombia,paragu... peleando la clasificacion con ecuador,chile,colombia,no crean que es lo mismo que jugar con costa rica,estados unidos,jamaca,honduras,guatemala,seria interesante tenerlos cerca,nos vemos en la copa america,ahh no se olviden de la final del 93 o mejor del mundial de alemania...|`|26f3d54873bc660134ec1aee02b5f2ebaa	Para mi que se enojaban mucho porque siempre veian que Mexico ganaba todo en la concacaf, y dijieron pues si los invitamos a participar nos van a traer mas dinero y ademas no van a tener oportunidad con nosotros, pero ha buena sorpresa, ya conocieron al Atlas, Chivas, America, Cruz Azul y anoche como te parecio el partido del Pachuca.|`|535a6103240f0bd6be8096d0f4281b1daa	No aprendes que Mexico es el gigante de Latinoamerica?|`|749e2051a0eddb83ed4154635e1ce2a8aa	bueno sabes porq segun mi opinion es porq televisa oelcanal mexicano y su federacion corre el billete y es por eso q los hacen participar e incluso cuando ellos hacen sus campeonatos como la conkaka no nos invitan para participar|`|78dd15504e2403e79cc63c3072b15a3daa	Porque dices que era mejor cuando no estaba Mxico en los torneos sudamericanos?

Los equipos mexicanos actualmente son los mejores economicamente, futbolisticamente y materialmente. Esa invitacion de equipos mexicanos ha aumentado el nivel de sudamerica, por que muchos futbolistas chilenos van a mexico y suben su nivel y regresan a su pais y aumnetan el nivel de sus ligas, se nota que estas ardido y creeme que a mi me pasaria lo mismo si las CHIVAS perdieran como perdieron en la libertadores contra SAO PAOLO que ha la postre fue el campeon mundial, yo creo que los equiposmexicanos van a seguir ganando todo en SUDAMERICA o si no casi todo.  ME gustaria que mexico en vez de 3 cupos a la libertadores tiviera 6 como argentina o brasil que tienen 8, eso si seria una humillacion para sudamerica!  se imaginan en la libertadores ha:  CHIVAS  AMERICA  CRUZ AZUL  ATLAS  PACHUCA  TOLUCA  MONTERREY   ojala y asi sea algun dia!|`|56439faf14d39c3dbffd166f65c158d2aa	No conoces el dicho: "con la plata baila el mono" ?    Mexico trae mucho dinero a la competencia, comenzando por los derechos de television que paga Televisa.    Obviamente que si ellos juegan en Sudamerica deberia jugarse una sola eliminatoria para el Mundial con Sudamerica y la Concacaf pero no les conviene porque alla clasifican de manera muy facil.|`|AA10664023	Pues mira... si es por la situacin geogrfica nicamente... pero en realidad si crees que Mxico no calificara al mundial entonces ?porque cada vez que se hace la Copa Amrica esta por lo menos en 4to lugar?    Y si... el asunto es que el ftbol se sostiene con dinero y no era tan buen negocio hasta que entraron equipos mexicanos...    ?Sabes que los partidos de libertadores y suramericana se ven solo por tv de paga? ?sabes cuanto representa eso a Conmebol  en derechos de TV?...    En fin... pues si gan un equipo Mexicano y te aseguro   que si Colo Colo gana ayer no estaras preguntando esto. Claro que si le tienen miedo a que equipos invitados sean mejores pues deberan de mejorar ustedes tambin ?no crees?  Yo creo que a los equipos les ayuda medirse con equipos mas fuertes para poder mejorar.|`|1214a37c6a6c1608a9ef2bf67aae321baa	pues mira, de las 6 copas america que hemos jugado hemos quedado en 2 como subcampeones, en 2 en tercer lugar y en 2 en 5 lugar. Sudamerica da 4 plazas directas al mundial, y considerando que seria a visita reciproca en eliminatorias, pues seguramente estariamos en el mundial cada cuatro a?os.  Quien nos ganaria? Uruguay? no hemos perdido con ellos en el centenario, y eso que jugamos en la copa america de uruguay vs ellos en ese estadio. Bolivia? a nosotros la altura no nos afecta. Chile? a nivel selecciones en partidos oficiales no nos ganan desde 1930. Ecuador? se vio en el mundial del 2002.  Venezuela? no creo. Colombia? solo nos ganaron en su pais.  Brasil? puede ser, pero te quiero recordar que si ves la historia de brasil, el pais que mas veces lo ha vencido en torneos oficiales en la ultima decada ha sido Mxico. (2 veces en copa america, dos en confederaciones y 3 en copa de oro) a cambio de solo 3 derrotas.  Argentina? en Mxico no podrian. Peru? jaja. mejor fuimos campeones del mundo sub 17 en peru. Paraguay? ese para que veas si nos tiene tomada la medida, pero es el nico.    Ojala Mxico jugara las eliminatorias vs ellos. As Mxico podria reclamar todas las artima?as que le hacen a los Mxicanos en los partidos de la copa america y de la libertadores. Pero como somos invitados nos tenemos que quedar calladitos, no importa que los colombianos corten los cables del alumbrado general en un partido de copa america en la que ellos estaban fundidos para evitar una derrota (machala). No importa que al boca le perdonen la tarjeta roja al portero en una final de sudamericana.  No importa que al portero del santos de torreon le repitan los penalties parados disque porque se movio, y al portero argentino le aguanten que se haya movido hasta medio metro. No podemos quejarnos que nunca nos dejan entrenar cuando va a haber un partido de libertadores en el estadio donde se va a jugar el partido por pretextos varios, como el de antier en santiago, que inventaron que no habia autorizacin para prender la luz. etc etc etc.  >Sudamericanos acepten algo, menospreciaron al futbol mexicano y les est costando caro.  Para mi lo mas justo es que se unieran la concacaf y la conmebol. Segn tu punto de vista calificarian 8 de los 10 sudamericanos al mundial, entonces porque no aceptan la unificacin? no sera porque mexico y estados unidos (si estados unidos) son superiores a casi todos los futboles de sus paises?.  Como olvidar la copa america de colombia donde Honduras elimino a brasil y costa rica quedo en tercer lugar y Mxico en segundo.|`|c07a0a19bddae8d9453f0d13c9afed15aa	CLARO IMBECIL.....ANTES NO TENIAN QUE ENTREGARLE EL TROFEO A UN EQUIPO MEXICANO, Y LUEGO LUEGO SE TE VE EL ARDOR Y LA IGNORANCIA YA SE DEMOSTRO.....MEXICO ES SUPERIOR....ASI O MAS CLARO?|`|1341099fc48c3cee6763696a982242ffaa	no se|`|869de4c6d3d7172fa99ec60d9e257fbbaa	PORQUE NOSOTROS MANTENEMOS A SUDAMERICA ??DE MXICO COMEN!!|`|e67292d1223faa8455506d7c86f6e823aa	Desgraciadamente el futbol mexicano est muy mal manejado.

HDbMh2YBaa	Work on your shooting. If you want to stand out you have to be able to shoot the ball. Shooting is about repetition. Work on it everyday or every chance you get. If you want to really be good then buy a shooting dvd or watch the NBA guys and copy what they do. Kobe did with Michael anyway.     Like shooting dribbling is developed simply by practicing. Its easy to develop if you practice everyday. Also you need to do pushups everyday or every other day to get stronger.     Im not going to type all this but look stuff online about how to eat the right foods. A nice protein balanced meal plan would benefit your strength. Also always play with competition. Play against people better than you to get better. If you play against scrubs you'll fool yourself into believing you're good and then get embarrassed. AAU is a good start.|`|im4PuUSvaa	Just practice.  No substitute for practicing.   For ball handling, dribble a ball everywhere you go (with both hands).  For shooting, whenever my shot gets off, I'll step in and shoot 100 shots from about 6 feet from each side of the lane, just to get my form back and to focus on fundamentals. You could try doing this every day over the summer.   And passing is something that you just get better at the more you play. You learn to read defenses better, and you learn to anticipate what the defense will do.     Also, with your shooting. Whenever you warm up or are just shooting around, don't just immediately start firing up three pointers and long shots. Stay inside of 15 feet until you get warmed up and get your form in a repetitive rhythm.    Hope this helps.|`|61L9P2tQaa	you kids always come up with the same question. and there will always be only one answer.

Also, continue playing against better competition...Nothing beats real game experience|`|gb8JpBLtaa	Only one way: Practice.    When I say practice, I don't mean shooting in your driveway.  95% of the game is not based on shooting the ball.  Do drills over and over until your perfect them and when you do play, play against players that are at your level or better than you, don't play with a bunch of kids.    Workout, run, eat right, and learn from other good players what you should be doing.

c04a8996e415524300eae2628eaa01cfaa	Este es un fenomeno local norteamericano que debido a la difusion comercial televisiva y de videos que tiene el basquetbol de la NBA nos invade.  A que se debe? ... pues a que en los barrios de gente afroamericana les gustan estos ritmos (rap,hip hop) y cuando se reunen a cascarear basquet normalmente la acompa?an con esta musica.    Porque el basquet???, pues porque la mayoria de los barrios realmente carece de areas deportivas y lo que alcanzan a tener es a veces solo  una jaula encementada y con tableros de basquet.  Hay que reconocer que debido a la enorme habilidad de esta raza para destrezas fisicas destacan mucho en este deporte.  Muchos jugadores salen de barrio y siendo ya grandes fuguras proyectan sus gustos personales a traves de la difusion comercial.  Quien no ha visto al Shaq rapeando?  Aunque tambien hay que ser objetivo y este fenomeno Basquet-Musica Hip Hop no se presenta como tal en Europa, u otras partes del mundo.

dbfd2d65de22f07fd7a0dcb2b71af7d7aa	The offensive line needs to be renewed. They were allowing in too many games this season, the defense to get to Big Ben. Defense is good and I don't think anything needs to be changed. We need to get some star talent at Wide Receiver but if Holmes can mature faster, we already have it.|`|1efd0b9793fa691a19514c50c3e30e1caa	Whoever is the best player left on the board out of  these posistions: CB,OLB,C,OT|`|817fa97251b90db20c61b1a18d79e2b1aa	i think they need another randle el type of player.  i know these are rare finds and i'm not so sure they'll be lucky enough to find one this year, but i still think that's what they need.  a nice compliment to hines ward.  even if he's not the kick returning/former qb/deep threat that randle el is.  they need a similar type of something to bring that threat back to their game.  he added so much to their offense last year and was an intricate part in their super bowl run.  they probably aren't champs if it wasn't for him because of the trick play they ran that permanently shifted momentum and put the game out of reach realistically.|`|AA11324074	definitely a DB...|`|2ab9d6b4b760a7967f4fecfea86f66d1aa	They need major help in their defensive backfield. They need someone to compliment Troy Polamalu in the backfield.  I guess it really will depend on who is on the board when it comes their turn to pick.|`|9074478db0544852db1911805014119aaa	First round I think they need to go out and draft a real sure bet offensive lineman.  As great as Hartings Faneca and those guys are the O line needs some help.  Marvel Smith and Max Starks have played awful this season.  There has been so many times where that offensive line has not given Roethlisberger any protection.  After that I wouldn't mind seeing them draft a corner.  We have gotten burnt by the pass too much this season.  Spotty play by guys like Ike Taylor and Bryant McFadden tells me we need someone else at that spot.  Also wouldn't hurt to get a big back as well.  Someone to more less compliment Willie Parker.  Parker is good just needs a big back to help punch it in because there was many times the Steelers drives stalled out in the red zone this year.|`|7ead0c0816fe4aebe55c29b572b0dfdbaa	Either a defensive back or a kick/punt returner. These are two areas that need major improvement.

The Celts are gonna win. For one, its in Boston which means Eddie House, Perk and other role players will step up while Farmar, Walton and others will disappear. Two, the lakers are on a road swing and 2 games in 3 nights or something, while KG's been in a bathroom all week, should be rested and is due for his once a week 20 and 10 performance. Celtics win 106-102|`|kFcdwVwdaa	Lakers can win tonight and they might. sure they are without bynum but they are going to send a message that although bynum makes a difference, they can do it without him. besides KG is a probable for tonight so he might not even play. and did we forget who ended the crytics last streak?|`|1ieKW07Naa	Lakers

First off, I've been a diehard Magic fan since 89 (one of the few left). I dont believe in the "who can we acquire?" aspect of fandom. This aint NBA 2k9. The Magic are 37-11 and one of the top 5 teams in the game. Their success is based on the inside-outside game and trading any of their 5 starters would disrupt their established roles and team chemistry. Second, theres something called bitchyness. Boston was a horrible team that traded for two allstars and won a title. Orlando has grown as a unit and has gradually become a force. They've groomed two allstars. That's respectable. As a fan, I'd rather them lose in the 2nd round with this team than win the title with Bosh or any other major acquisition. You younger guys will never get that concept. Youre not a real fan of a team if youre always looking for an allstar they can acquire.
fuYYRJXtaa	Suns are willing to trade anyone, BUT Nash... They released that earlier.|`|21J0IIZbaa	The Suns needs to keep both players.|`|0gWxnY0Gaa	No freakin way! I ? Steve Nash with a passion, and I ? The Suns with a passion!|`|Xcd8ZGu3aa	Nash + Amare is like Kobe + Shaq|`|X7Yt4qo3aa	I would definetely trade him. He has not improved at all and I can see him suddenly going downhill from now on. I think they might be able to trade him for young Josh Smith, vet Chauncey Billups, Rajon Rondo (combination), Derrick Rose. etc.    Josh Smith- The Suns would gain Al Horford and Josh Smith for Steve Nash and the Tower of Lopez!    Chauncey Billups- The Suns would get Billups and Martin for Nash and Hill or Richardson.    Rajon Rondo- The Suns would get Rajon Rondo, Leon Powe, and Kendrick Perkins for Steve Nash and Lopez.    Derrick Rose- The Suns would get Derrick Rose and Luol Deng for Steve Nash and this time not Lopez but Barbosa.      To AirGuitar, if Nash and Stoudemire are like Bryant and O'Neal, why don't wither of them have any rings? And they do have O'Neal, too, don't they?|`|HDbMh2YBaa	I dont think Nash is the biggest problem. They should trade Stat and Barbosa to see what they could get for them. Nash will probably bolt when he's a free agent but they shouldnt trade him now. They have to sell tickets.     They need some defensive minded players. Keep Shaq, Nash, and Richardson for offense. But trade for a defensive small forward and power forward. Bell was a good defender but he had questionable shot selection. They need a solid defender at the 3 position and a better defender at the 4.     Shawn Marion wouldnt be bad to have back at the 3. Haslem wouldnt be either. A young guy like Josh Smith could be a good fit. He's defensive minded and can rebound and block shots. Josh Howard is pretty solid on defense as well. Loul Deng is another example of the type of player they need.     David Lee would be solid at the 4 spot. Anthony Parker would be another option. Guys like Joe Smith or Mikki Moore would be good fits at the 4 spot. Bottom line is they need some more defense and less scoring. Shaq, Nash, Hill, and Richardson is plenty of scoring in your starting lineup. When you have Amare Stoudemire whining about his touches and the Suns getting killed on defense its simple common sense.|`|IAnT8aGsaa	Nash is the only good player, trade nash and the suns are screwed|`|kFcdwVwdaa	naw they claimed him untouchable a couple of weeks ago.|`|8sqOVMvNaa	no way  thats there two "Franchise" players  theyre nothing without them two|`|cu67LPb0aa	I think without either of the two on the team, it would be hopeless. It's not that great of a season for them, but it could be worse.|`|UaSFuT59aa	You gotta understand the business. Kerr is not trading any of the big three this season. He's only been gm for a year and a half and he hastily traded the most beloved Sun in Shawn Marion. Now he has to justify that move by giving this team a legit chance to succeed. Thats why he made the JRich trade early in the season. Most teams sell their pieces when they struggle but they acquired more talent in JRich (arguably) and are trying to win now. But to answer ur question, the piece that doesnt fit is Shaq, because its killed their identity offensively and has wrecked Amare's confidence to be able to dominate a game. Truly though, theyre screwed because they can't see the 2nd round this year and, if they cant trade Shaq next season, Nash might bolt as a free agent.

bSxEfkZQaa	I myself always considered straight edge to be no drinking, smoking, abuse of/illegal drugs, and casual sex. I am straight edge but don't refrain from the legal drugs, obviously because of health reasons. I don't think it's the best choice not to have legal drugs, if you are referring to stuff like painkillers or subscribed drugs, as long as they're not abused I consider it okay.      But again, it is your choice. I'm straight edge but I try to focus on the basics that I mentioned earlier. I think whatever works for you as long as it has the basic principles of straight edge is fine.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	right now i think your straight edge lifestyle has left you very confused because you posted this in the WRESTLING SECTION!

AA11488609	Yes he is a great coach.  He resurrected Kansas and UNC to new heights when they weren't so great when he first got the job.  Bill Self may have had all of his guys win last year's ship but the Jayhawk job wouldn't be so attractive if Williams didn't get them to several Final Fours, led by guys like Kirk Hinrich, Nick Collison, Drew Gooden, and Paul Pierce.    Quagmire:  Yes, I know that they had Phog Allen, Naismith, and Larry Brown.  Though Brown got them a title, the Jayhawks got a postseason ban in the 88-89 season thanks to Brown's recruiting violations.  That could've turned KU into a mediocre team for the next 10 or more years but it didn't happen.  Michigan had the same thing in the early '90's, and the men's team is STILL paying the price nearly 20 years later.|`|Z0AE7eHiaa	yes good, not great    I think he should have won more than one championship considering the teams he had at kansas. He should win the championship this year as well.|`|0gWxnY0Gaa	Yea he is a great coach, the stupidest choice he's made this year tho is suspending Will Graves for the rest of the season...|`|7dPm35LYaa	are you kidding me? he's very good one of the best coaches.|`|1ieKW07Naa	He wouldnt be my first pick. But he's alright.|`|4yiH5TiQaa	No, he's a bad coach! He can't win with any of his own players, the last time he won something big was the NCAA championship(which some people say he bribed the refs) in 2005 with the last coaches players. He is not a good coach people think he's good because he's on a overrated UNC team.    Edit- Aclexx, Kansas would still be a job everyone would want even if  Roy never went there, because it was at Kansas where Basketball was invented, ever hear of Phog Allen or James Naismith? They were there wayy before Roy and they made KU a basketball school!    Michigan is doing alright now.|`|0ylaEVtraa	perfect example the kansas jayhawks game in the final four  he did not call a timeout until unc was down 25 to 7  he sit there like a idiot|`|2dF53Qfjaa	Tom Izzo!!!

OfNTLq3Qaa	I guess it depends on who the two wrestlers are. What I mean is if your going to have a major upset then it's fine.   However, if it's a bitter feud at a PPV then no. The feud should end with a finisher. A roll-up would cheapen the victory in my opinion.  I hate DQ finishes at PPV's, I think there should be a pin or submission. Save the DQ's for regular TV.  I have not really thought about this so this is the best I have right now.|`|BglekVnQaa	Why have a finisher and you didn't finish your opponent off with it.|`|RlZvWkSIaa	Whats the point of having a finisher if your not going to use it.|`|3nN1vTTuaa	i think it ruins a match when they win with a cheap roll up. A finisher gives a match a meaningful ending.|`|6E16tR6xaa	Um no. I understand your idea. But, I think the only way I want to see a match end is like a pin from behind or someone pulling off something dirty when the ref's not looking. Other then that I want to see their finishers. I feel like the finisher  is closure to the match. It's especially exciting when they kick out of a finisher. But, that's just me.|`|TAPBWPJLaa	I think they're fine with me.    They also lessen the chances of wrestlers being buried as well and make endings to matches less predictable. Matches don't have to include "hit the finisher" endings all the time to be considered anything good.|`|XMXuJSPWaa	Too much emphasis is placed on finishing moves anyway. I know its entertainment, and it gets a pop from the crowd, but I would rather see some decent grappling (a la Dean Malenko, Benoit (minus the crossface), early Kurt Angle, Taz). A small package or backslide pin is fine in my book.|`|bagXMU7oaa	I guess it's ok but I really love it when someone get in position for like the Batista bomb or the 619 I get to jump up and yell "Yes! Yes! That's how it's done".    But i haven't really noticed that.|`|037d26fcff528b19e4939c529e6ccad8aa	well these types of endings should be used in ethier   A) a heel escaping with the win therefore keeping belt  B) the end of an epic match with one face/heel outsmarting the other. look at hart v bulldog at summerslam  C)an distratcion in a tag tea match    these endsings are ethier cheap or can really surpirse the audience during a match where the finsheres didn't finsh the guy off, howevere in a long standing fued with haterd it shouldnt be used as the person didn't finsh him off.    plus look at brett hart, he didn't always use the sharpshooter, he liked using roll ups to win his match's|`|E7TkNO00aa	No, you should enjoy watching the matches and get what you paid for, It's only fair.

LzkujA3Faa	Bravo Clarkey!    I don't care for what reasons he had opted out. If Bingle has a hand in it then i want to give her three cheers. At least she talked some sense into him and made him understand where his loyalties should lie. I wish the spouses of our other players will also follow the example. . I was a bit sad when clarke went back on his words and decided to join IPL. But  it is good to see finally  at least Mitch and Clarkey said no to the filthy money making business|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Hey Ange, I think it was more Bingle pressuring him that he dropped the idea. She is already causing problems in the team with her demands on Clarke & she needs to be put in her place or Clarke will have the shortest captaincy in history. But having said that, I am glad he did opt out, as he really needs to focus on his team if he plans to replace Ponting as captain.I wish CA would ban the lot of them from going. Ange, you have been asking some great Qs lately. Keep up the good work mate!|`|AA11088802	good one|`|0QBKiP2naa	good to see Clarke is doing it hopefully he will become fulltime captain as Ponting has no idea and is useless as for Johnosn i wish he would go and stay right away he is so OVER RATED  should NEVER EVER be picked for Aus|`|5GUjFJjkaa	Poor Phil.  Love is worth much more than money, obviously you don't know that.  You remind me of people who save all their lives and live a tightwad life style so that they can "make up for it later", as if they will go mountain climbing when they are 65.    Stay at home Aussies. The IPL is all rigged anyway.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	its good decision|`|gfxXikenaa	you are indirectly pointing out that the other aussie players who joined the IPL , are not loyal ~  quite interesting,    ~ Clarke wanted to get the team song over and done with so he could go and met Lara for a drink but Katich took umbrage to this and grabbed him around the throat and had to be forcibly restrained by other players.  and it doesnt matter much if he joins IPL or not ~  because after Roy , its now clarke who is showing lack of commitment for the team by not wanting to wait for the team song  ~     interesting to see "2 sides" of clarke.|`|e4roTumKaa	Are you suggesting that all the others players in IPL are traitors ?? These blokes need to make hay whilst the sunshines, I have no problems with them making a extra 500,000 here and there, they are Professional sportsmen, I like most other aussies work  5 day 40 hour week, If I can do it so can these finely tuned athletes, I will wager with you that before they have hung up there baggy green, both Clarke and Johnston have joined the IPL|`|1ayvDGcLaa	It is interesting to see you bandy around with words like 'loyalty'. Perhaps your dictionary is different to the usual ones. It is hard to tell from here seeing I have no evidence of your loyalty to the nation.   Is there anything in the contract that prevents people from participating in other tournaments when they are not playing for Australia?  Are you jealous that Ponting, Warne et al can make more money than what the contract with CA provides them? or is it merely that it is related to the Indian crowd that bugs you?  Regardless, I agree with the money man- these folks have a small window to make money and they should when they can. They have talents that can be transalated into dollars. Why should we grudge them that.  Clarke and Johnson have made an individual choice which in no way puts them in a better light than others who will play in the IPL|`|cy16ihq1aa	nope as someone said Clarke's agent told lalit modi that he pulled out because he though no one will bid for him...  so to avoid the embarrassment he came back to oz...    i dont think it was smart on clarke's part to make his base price so high....  i think he thought he was better than he actually is...|`|9582065979547eb3aa0bbc08ea22af5daa	Yes - when I first heard about it, I thought "wonderful news!!"  I am a little worried about the IPL business, it would appear that the contracts are very restrictive to the point where some Aussie players had to ask the IPL if they could have permission to play in Aus . .     Lots of players complained about this - but, really, they should have read their contract before they signed it and not just concentrated on seeing big dollar signs before their eyes.    It is a good move for him to follow Pontin's lead and give the IPL a miss - but I really hope that he is doing it for the right reasons and not simply because he wants to be around Lara more . .    I am very concerned for Pup - I think he is quite infatuated and is losing his grip on the game.  Lara needs to loosen the leash a little and let Pup breathe and Pup needs to realise that other players have wives and girlfriends and keep the balance right.    I hope he comes through this one - he's a great player.|`|tz7JEqstaa	Any Aussie player who whines about the cricket schedule and then plays in the IPL is a whinging hypocrite.   Clarke is not playing for exactly that reason. He prefers to spend the short period of time that they are not playing International Cricket with his family, same applies to Mitch Johnson.   I agree with Bingalee,  I wish none of our guys would go...money means more to some than others I guess.|`|yeb7fyHsaa	It's good that Clarke understands where true happiness lies. As opposed to money-hungry players like Mascarenhas, Clarke understands that he needs to be with his family and is intent on being as fit as possible to represent his country. It's good to see players like him, Bopara, and others who take more pride in playing for their national team instead of being a part of the IPL franchise.|`|Mfi84xBQaa	Can't say anything .  Though , Good Point ...........................................|`|zjhSe5PCaa	aww come on you have it all wrong. the only reason pup is not going to IPL is so that he can chase his girl friend around. He lives in that mortal fear of loosing her keeps showering her with gifts. I am sure she must have turned a snotty nose if he had mentioned IPL lol    Mate you got it all wrong his love and loyalty lies with his girl friend and rightly so too|`|6niE3wSCaa	I think Lalit Modi, the IPL Chairman, got it spot on. Clarkey's base price was $1 million. He was scared that no one would pay that much for him and that would be really embarassing for him. So he pulled out to avoid that embarassment.    Why else would he pull out like the day before? It all makes sense.|`|4QVDXBS8aa	I think Michael Clark as a sportsman with a short "shelf life" should commit himself to his earning status. Don't wait for burn-out and early retirement due to injury. Go for the earnings now, plenty of time for family and with a reasonable degree of wealth a much more stable family life.    Prestige is short, compared to income. I feel there is a "little" immaturity if you don't elect to sign up for IPL......it will also make you a much better sportsman and cricketer. Best of luck!|`|ResOYx5Naa	johnson and clarke are both idiots not playin in the ipl cuz of girlfriends hel johnson just moved states for his G/f. a cricketers career only last about 15 years about 35 years less than the average person so seriously common they can make up for lost time wid da family in those 35 yrs.  the funny thing is that johnson and clarke only have g/f not familys they r just puppy love fools. ponting hayden gilly warne mcgrath all had kids wen they signd wid IPL im sure there wives understood that cricket is there job
ujMsLUcNaa	Kobe and LeBron both put up great stats but it was against two teams that offered zero defensive pressure.  The Toronto team that Kobe torched for 81 points, gave up an average of 104.1 points per game to it's opponents during the 2005-06 season.  The New York team that LeBron messed around with and pulled a triple double this season, is currently giving up an average of 106.5 points per game to it's opponents.  Kobe probably could have scored another 81 points against the Knicks if he wanted.    Nevertheless, I think both performances are impressive because each player has mastered the part of the game that makes them unique.  In LeBron's case, it's never easy to obtain a triple double and score 50 points.  People don't realize how hard it is to score that much while keeping your teammates involved.  With LeBron's size, the rebounds may be a given but the 11 assists puts him in Oscar Robertson and Nate "Tiny" Archibald territory.  LeBron has worked on the part of his game that has been holding him back in recent years - his free throw shooting.  Once he perfects his 3-point shot (2 for 7 in that game), he may be able to challenge Kobe 81 points mark.    Kobe's performance against the Raptors was not only a display of scoring power but it was also a trademark of efficiency.  I'm not a Kobe fan (I'm sure you know that) but I can appreciate a near perfect game when I see one.  Bryant made 60.9% of his field goals (28 out of 46), 53.9% of his 3-pointers (7 out of 13), and connected 18 out of 20 free throws in that game.  That is about as efficient as you can get.  The fact that Kobe isn't a big men who plays close to the basket, really makes the field goal percentage thing special.  Plus, it takes a considerable amount of focus, training, and precision to make that much 3 pointers and free throws.    Now does that mean these performance carry any weight towards measuring a player's Hall of Fame status or where they rank among the Legends?  Certainly not.  Kobe's 81 point performance was a great individual display of his athletic ability and basketball IQ.  Elgin Baylor, Bernard King, and Dominique Wilkins has some pretty memorable high scoring games and one day, I'm pretty sure we'll remember Kobe for his scoring forte as well as his ability to put on a show just like the previous names I've mentioned.  However, until Kobe wins a championship as the leader of his team and obtains an NBA Finals MVP award(s), he shall be remembered more as the Scottie Pippen or Jerry West of the modern era as rather than Michael Jordan's heir to the throne.    LeBron also  has a knack for putting on a great show but he's looking more everyday like the next Oscar Robertson instead of the next Jordan.  LeBron's 50 point triple double performance was a great display of his well rounded ability.  There have been quite a few players in NBA history who have exhibited these great all-around attributes.  Oscar, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Scottie Pippen, and Grant Hill are some names that come to mind.  LeBron still has more growth in him but until he takes his game to the next level either by averaging a triple double or leading his team to a title, he'll probably be remembered more as a Grant Hill rather than an Oscar, Magic, or Bird.    These games you mentioned are only one game out of their regular season rotation and certainly not defining moments in their career.  LeBron put up a great performance on the road but Kobe displayed an unparallel efficiency at home so both performances should level out at some point.  Let's not forget that both players put on a performance against teams that don't play defense.  It's funny how both Toronto and New York have some kind of personnel ties or affiliation with the happy run-n-gun only Phoenix team of a few seasons ago.  Jerry Colangelo was the former owner of the Suns and then moved on to take over the front office in Toronto.  New York's current coach Mike D'Antoni used to guide those Phoenix Suns all offense team.  Well, the bottom line is, I think both performance were equally impressive.    Just my 2 cents.|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	Kobe Bryant's 61 points... because it shows that his head is okay... i thought Kobe suffered a head injury or concussion when he crashed into Bynum's knee!|`|i6uzNQcJaa	James...look he has 11 assists and 10 rebounds...kobe had 30 more points but only had 2 assists...hes a ball hogger|`|WLXFAeSnaa	LeBron James easily|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	I'd have to go with the 81 point night.|`|dOelpoecaa	Kobe's man. I dont see how you can beat that|`|98wFqBwSaa	James was more impressive.       How does a guard get 40 touches and only 2 assists?  That's awful.|`|2OoSK35xaa	To Me is Kobe's 81.  As much as its almost standard for LeBron to get the rebounds and assists and 25-30 points a game, the numbers aren't that much better than normal.  Also, the cavs don't have that knockdown shooter who can constantly make jumpers.  Lebron is always hyped for a game at MSG, and the Knicks play a fast uptempo game allowing much higher numbers in transition defense and easy hoops.|`|NALuet7Zaa	Kobe's 81 was better... But Jordan's seven straight triple double is above all of that...|`|9cwBAGOsaa	Lmao....hahahaha...you officially have the honors of stupidest question on yahoo answers....the 81 point performance is still being talked about by everybody...dumbest qustion ever...kb's performance against toronto in 06 was the best single performance ever in history...that is a fact|`|VxLGmZU6aa	Lebron james 52 points is better between the two because Kobe's 81 came against none other than the raptor's (and they are my hometown team :( Even though the raptor's weren't as bad that season as they are now, it must of done something to them, whereas the Knicks are playing fairly well and James scored quite a bit on them. I would have to go with Kobe's 61 points at the garden though (even though its not one of the 2 options).|`|45e71bc8ca903cd0b9c0e4294eff6f04aa	kobe's 81    did you see skeets post about them adding stats to lebron??    yeah yeah  you  cant top 81 with any performance|`|BIoZnAgoaa	Definately Kobe's 81, it's the second highest scoring performance in NBA history. If you score 81 points in a game regardless of your assists or rebounds, you deserve alot of credit. LeBron's performance didnt even come close to that.

That man is a great man, as is Cena. Look how horrible people are trying to make them look. It's not fair. Nothing can be done, the only thing that can be done, is change the media.

People judge Pro Wrestling on what they think. And sadly, almost everyone thinks its a fake sport. They cant really do anything since its scripted. ESPN and other major sports networks always decline to show coverage of Pro Wrestling because its scripted. But honestly, does that really make it fake? Just because its scripted does that really mean that the injuries, submissions, fighting, and weapons are all fake as well? False. These ARE Real, Professional Wrestlers put their bodies on the line every week just to entertain us, and yet people still disrespect them. Its a shame, even for major networks to think that. But to answer your question, Its just a matter of thought, we can't tell people what to think of it, they just go by what they think.

Once the media finds outs they are just being used to promote a PPV as in the case of the TODAY Show being made a fool of with the Billy & Chuck "marriage" they will spin everything and make the wrestling company look bad.   So instead of getting positive promotion the wrestling business takes 2 steps backwards and the stereotypes of being nothing but "circus carny" is reenforced.  This happened once again with the movie "The Wrestler".....this was a once in a lifetime opportunity to gain some positive publicity but WWE screwed up again as usual.  By thinking that a match between Jericho and the actor from the movie was a good idea and started shrilling it on movie award shows.....Mickey Rourke backed out of it once the "Hollywood" people told him it was a huge mistake for his acting career which is in comeback mode.    The simplest way and most beneficial way to "get the better of the media" would be doing charity events.  Put a positive perception out there instead of always "being on" and always "being in character".|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	To start get rid of Vince McMahon and Vince Russo. Well, maybe McMahon can stay but Russo has to go. Banish him from the business forever.    Save hardcore and specialty matches for bitter feuds, not have them every other show.  Push the younger talent.  Have storylines that the casual fan will believe. After all they make up  majority of paying customers.

q4v9lO6Laa	Ya this is rediculous, if they're dropping bras and pantie matches and the playboy photos, then they should also drop the eye candy. If the WWE is focusing on the younger generation, then have some divas that dont look like they're going to die from an eating disorder. I think the whole PG thing is so that superstars can be role models, the last time i checked, my parents didn't want me looking like maria for when i grow up, they would rather see me as natalya being a strong women and succeding in life|`|4OCcsDeTaa	mos def. natyla melina beth mickie are some great divas. beth is in a good spot but not the others i listed and they all deserve it. they ruined victoria and she was really good at wrestling.|`|2rJwgk40aa	I agree.i think it spit in the face of all the women who work so hard to get where they are|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	You say that but look at the past few champions in the WWE for the women and you see that they are making moves in the right direction. they are trying to fade out the models, it takes time but unless they just cut all the bad wrestlers we just have to deal with them being around. By product of the attitude era, Talentless women in a wrestling ring.|`|GJsIZeUIaa	The diva division is all about looks not skill. Beth Phoenix does get alot of time on RAW, though. Melina too. It's getting better.|`|P3g2Gz2Yaa	they put $luts first than proper divas that can acctually fight like mickie james and beth phoenix|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Yes, but thats WWE for you. Looks over talent. I hope Natalya starts getting used better soon.|`|BglekVnQaa	That's cause they actually know how to do the move. If you're doing a move like Kelly Kelly or Maria there's now way you're going to hurt yourself cause the move wasn't effective.|`|IzgJpVgBaa	i think there should b 2 divas matches a night not 1|`|geMe9kSNaa	Yeah I know what you mean but I think that some of the diva's are too concited for there own good.|`|mDuiiVN7aa	I agree with you 100%, Vince just Wants an eye candy and nothing more. Look at Mickie, Jillian, Maryse, Michelle, Melina they all can wrestle a decent match, but they are stucked with some stupid gimmick (Jillian), or are barely seen in ring any more(Mickie). While Kelly and Maria are overrated just because of their looks and get all the t.v. time in the world. I mean some divas can actually do something in that ring, but they do not get a chance to prove it!!!

New York by far has the better players...    Tampa by far has the younger better futured players    Boston has both of those and has the best coaching         So, in my book i would say Boston just because the yankees have always had the better looking roster but cant pull it out. So why would that change this year? Secondly, Tampa before this last season was at the bottom of the MLB. This season they may be able to pull out the AL wild card and maybe do some playoff heroics but i dont think they will win the east.    So I think it will turn up like this...    1. Boston ( 101-62 )  2. Tampa ( 95-67 )  3. New York ( 93-69 )  4. Toronto ( 72-90 )  5. Baltimore ( 64-98 )    [ regular season prediction ]    I also think boston will win the east and have tampa win wild card.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	Well since they haven't  played any games  yet, none of them(LOL) but the Yankees do look good & picked up some key players in key positions & will be a contender as always & be tough to beat so I say the Yankees win AL East

Id4OLpIZaa	I don't think its as high as most people will think. Believe it or not, a lot of people have reached the summit and returned without dying. The second question you  should ask is what % of the climbers get injured and how seriously. I don't know that answer.    the mortality rate of those who tried to climb Mt.Everest is roughly 1.3%. Out of more than 28,000 people who attempted to climb Mt. Everest, only 212 people died.     Check the link below (if your like me and lazy to read, just skip to the last paragraph which is the answer to your question). The article seems correct, but try doing more research to prove the validity of this article.|`|paVoq3Psaa	if you are willing to train train and train and learn about surving skills  then its abot 50 out of 100 that  you will be able to make it but if your not fit then 20 out of 100 chance  good luck if you decide to climb it hope you make it and hope you like the cold like the cold|`|tWcsDDDJaa	the chances of you dieing is very high.

It depends on how fit you are, the weather conditions, there is ALWAYS a chance of accident. I really cannot tell you the chance you may die because this depends on a number of things. It's more dangerous if you're not ready or if you're climbing Everest yourself, having a team shall help. Be sure you have a lot of food, first aid kits, water, and emergency equipment if anything goes wrong.    Mount Everest is tough. I assume there would be a high risk|`|n5NltZVGaa	Mount Everest isn't keeping track of percentages, sorry.  Neither should you.  Years of hard work getting ready for the climb is a good pursuit, but understand that numbers don't apply and if you're ready to give up everything, prepare your family for your highly probable demise, then surge ahead.  You climb Mount Everest because it's there.  No numbers, no percentages.  It kills you or it doesn't.  Remember this and good luck.

BvO91rHBaa	i don't like them NEARLY as much as when they were PRE-SHIMANO.  Shimano now owns Loomis.  Gary Loomis (hence the G in G.Loomis) sold it to them a while back.  He stayed on for a while, directing operations, but I believe he is now gone permanently.  Shimano lowered the quality, in my opinion, and I can't defend them like I used to.      With that said, I still like the rods, but not to the same extent as I did before.  I have some older Loomis GL3's that have been compared to newer IMX's, and they're ACTUALLY MORE responsive and sensitive than their more expensive, newer step up.  It's all in the way they're made.      Like the other answer said, you're paying for a name that HAD been sysnonomous with quality....now you're just paying for the name only.      As for the warranty, there are two options - one is to send it back, they'll examine it and determine if it was manufacturer defect or user error that caused the break.  Whatever their "specialists" determine, they let you know.  If they find it was "their" fault, they either make the repair, or ust replace the rod with another - that's relatively cheap....maybe $20 I think?  The other option is the "No Questions Asked" warranty.  You give them $50 and not matter WHOSE FAULT it was, they just give you a replacement.  Some authorized retailers will handle this "over the counter" for you.  Other's won't; you just have to check with them.    I've called G Loomis about warranty issues before - let's just say, I've had some INTERESTING conversations with the person on the other end....|`|EmU83DRZaa	I always thought that G. Loomis rods had a lifetime warrenty on them.|`|p9RS2Wh6aa	The ONLY brand of rod I have ever had break was G.Loomis.  There are a lot of brand rods out now that are just as good if not better in my book.  Yes they have a life time LIMITED warranty, if you like spending $50 - $70 for a replacement, even if you do a expedited exchange threw the dealer you bought it from.  A couple of fishing stores in my area have stopped carrying them and put Shimano Cumara rods in their place.  To each there own tho, just like with cars, trucks, boats everyone has their own preferences.  But for myself I will never buy another rod I pay $250+ for and have it break on the first hook set.

HQR71OhVaa	Movies like Cliffhanger get climbers groaning because they realize how unlikely such events are. Such scenes however are integral to the plot. OK so back to reality - climbing equipment is tested and certified by a couple of international organizations and rarely is it equipment that leads to accidents. Mostly it is user error or equipment abuse. I don't believe standards are any different now but even back then harnesses can take huge forces and loads. Typically a harness will hold somewhere in the region of 4000 lbs. Buckles are designed so slippage as seen in the movie simply doesn't exist, and even if one component failed, the whole harness isn't going to fall to pieces as the movie portrayed. To further that point, take another look at the scene. You'll notice the harness failure shots are all close ups and there is a reason for that. The buckle you see seemingly ripping apart had to be physically cut on the back side. It was then loaded out of camera view with a couple thousand pounds before it failed. So now knowing that, do you weigh more than 2000 lbs, and would you agree climbing gear is safe.  Personally I put both my trust, and my life in climbing gear every week and I've been climbing a dozen years. I've swung on ropes hundreds of feet above the ground, even hung from underneath helicopters thousands of feet above jagged rocks. The short answer to your questions - climbing gear is safe and what you see in movies is rarely representative of reality.|`|eEhG1aSWaa	lol, i love the part where stallone hammers in the ONE piton to "secure" the safety line.  It looks like its about to pop right out.|`|918cMmVnaa	that would never happen these days..  and they were stupid to be doing that without proper equipment...(and it waasnt proper equipment because if it was then that wouldnt have happened)  .. you are very safe using climbing gear these days... as long as you dont use dodgey stuff and go with people who dont know wat they are doing...|`|SBBnWsJJaa	OK...it's a MOVIE.  In fact, if you watch the credits, the company that makes the equipment that was shown in the movie (I believe it was Black Diamond) states the impossibility of this event taking place.    Let me just say this about another climbing movie - Vertical Limit.  There is NO way I would climb with any of these people.  NONE of them knew how to construct a proper anchoring system or place protection.  BUT...it's just a movie.|`|mMFJrPbvaa	Dude its a movie...that scene makes the majority of the plot. All gear is certified by the UIAA and CE.  Even the ratings printed on the equipment is on the conservative side.      my friends and I love watching those movies...Cliff Hanger and Vertical Limit just so we can find all the climbing mistakes or impossibilities.  Like in Vert Limit when he lunges from one mountain to the other and uses his ice axes to stick the landing....never happen you`ll bounce right off.  How about this one- In The Matrix (I cant remember which one it was) When someone jumps from a helicopter to catch Neo when they are on a roof top..or maybe it was when they were going to save that Black dude in that building. Eitherway, when they "rappell" out of the helicopter the carabiner anchoring the rope to the inside of the Copter is loaded on its gate.  Its in a wierd position to the bolt and they jump out shock loading the gate.  We all caught it immediately and werent even looking for it.    You want a real outdoors movie watch "Touching the Void" Its more mountaineering than climbing and its a true story.    I dont think twice when I go climbing.|`|iRKV3j6Gaa	its absolutely safer...climbing equipment is made to wthstand all sorts of stress...TV and movies lie and try to make it seem cooler or more dangerous to climb than it really is.  Its like the openin scene of Vertical Limit, where the Cam breaks...the company who makes Cams was furious about that, because it was a blatant lie, and really hurt that company's reputation.  It is safe...I mountain climb, so does my Uncle(he does it professionally)...its perfectly safe if you know what you're doing.|`|Mv1F4Ooyaa	Is she 120 stone?|`|EoPRTJr4aa	as a long time climber I can tell you when I watched that scene from cliffhanger I was laughing. they made that buckle look like soft lead. if threaded back through properly no harness will come apart like that. the climbing portrayed in cliffhanger was pure hollywood, there is very little fact in that movie.|`|DOB4tbquaa	That's Hollywood for you, the biggest danger on the mountains is human error not equipment. And of course avalanches, but that's pretty self explanatory.

Your 52 and 10 does not count when you give up 39 and 13! Real legends don't get torched like that by underachieving journeymen on the other end. His whole goal was to one up Kobe's game and in the process he got his @ss torched on the other end. Secondly LA had another guy with 30 which means Kobe was not really dominating the ball Lebron had 10 assist but not another guy with more then 15 points. Which shows me he totally took the ball out of the hands of the other guys so that he could pad his stats. 20 team assist on 37 field goals is a terrible stat and when you take it next level you get 9 assist on 20 field goals made split between 11 players.

Stay away, please.|`|wX5xoAN8aa	Trust me, unless you are hunting with it, or using them competitively, ( like paintball only with airsoft) they will get boring FAST.
hL3eS2zKaa	Chris Jericho is a wrestler. He is very skilled in the ring and one of the best. Actually, it's the other way around. Micky Rourke is scared of him because he doesnt have respect for Rourke's "kind". He also said he has to watch his a$$ if he appears at Wrestlemania. All of this happened cuz Rourke said that he can beat Jericho. But its not true, unless he has a gun.|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Who gives.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	We've never heard of Chris Jerico? Who is chris Jerico? We know Chris Jericho who has wrestled for wreslting promotions in canada, Europe, Japan and the United States. Chris Jericho is afraid that were he to cripple Mickey Rourke, which he is easily capable of doing, he would be open to a multi-million dollar lawsuit. You are referring to a storyline and you have it all wrong. Mickey Rourke is afraid that Chris Jericho would hurt him and cripple him for life.|`|P3g2Gz2Yaa	i just saw a picture of Mickey Rourke what a junky freak chris jericho can kick his @ss any day|`|9CLRMnhSaa	Dude   GET A ****** LIFE!

CHRIS ISN'T!|`|mJvZhdAuaa	Chris Jericho is a WWE Superstar competing on the Raw brand, who has held numerous titles in the company, including the Intercontinental Championship, WWE Championship, World Heavyweight Championship, and others.  (Jericho is also the front man to the group Fozzy.)  And, he isn't scared of Mickey Rourke.  Rourke basically called Jericho out when he was on the red carpet at the SAG awards last month, Jericho simply told him that that was the wrong thing to do.  When Rourke was on Larry King Live, Jericho also appeared, and Rourke backed out.    If anything, Rourke is afraid of Jericho, and he should be!|`|DPSadeFjaa	because Mickey Rourke is better than Chris Jericho at wrestling!!!|`|VxLGmZU6aa	Chris Jericho is one of the best wrestlers out there today and its the opposite. Mickey Rourke is afraid of Jericho (he stepped down from the challenge he originally made with Jericho).
1ea9371ed9b8927bf562834c578805c1aa	It could be because he had 2 matches yesterday.

cb9KqrUyaa	Yes IMO he was way out of line,what gives Katich the right to grab another member of his team around the throat?  I don't care if it was 2 hours after the match or 5 hours.Simon had no right to physically touch anyone..  Yes Clarkie may have wanted the song sung so he could go and hang with his Mrs,but gee after 5 hours in the dressing room i would want to get out of there too.  Yes i agree the song should be sung when they get into their dressing room,not hours later.|`|AA11088802	is it happened|`|gfxXikenaa	i didn't know that but its shocking that katich grabbed clarke around the throat  and had to be forcibly restrained by other players. ~|`|ikDtDL7Vaa	who would have wasted 5 hours when you have a bird like lara.|`|iIe763Rjaa	I think he was!|`|tsolKgv4aa	clarke is the one at faulr here, he had roy suspened from team for not following team rules in darwin, so he wanted to b with laura instead of team. the team rules are it up to huusey wen the song sung and all team to stay for it. katich grab him for not being following of team rules and remined him of roy so far as im concerned he is in the wrong and nothing but a two faced show pony just wish it was roy that grabbed him by throat
jHJ0W9QNaa	yes, that is a good trade. Pau Gasol's knee will be safe when Kobe Bryant leaves. we don't want another torn MCL for the Lakers!|`|lMDy8W0Raa	LOL. The stupidest question of the day.|`|RBdy17Ahaa	Then KING would hate Wade.|`|jKOB7n35aa	It would make them better, but the Heat aren't retards. Therefore, it will never happen.|`|ED7bwcdnaa	No, it will not benefit Kobe and LAL|`|Nuj1eScCaa	It wouldn't be a bad trade for the Lakers because one thing would remain the same....they would remain major title contenders even with Wade and Marion.    Kobe is a great player, but the Lakers are still a very good team without him, so I don't think losing Bryant for Wade would kill their chances off a title. Plus, maybe Marion could revive his career as a starter in L.A.    None of this would ever happen, but it wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing for L.A.|`|Rhk35LUcaa	wade or marion would not be able to run the triangle.    any time you trade bryant you will never make the lakers better.

4maLlESdaa	The Moskito is sort of a hybrid between a touring boat and a racing kayak. It's long (18'5"), narrow (17.3"), and fast. Whether it's a good kayak for you depends on what you're into and what your experience level is. If you're new to paddling or have only been in recreational boats, the Moskito is going to feel extremely tippy and there's a good chance you'll be upside-down a lot at first. On the other hand, if you've been paddling sea kayaks for a while and are looking to move to a "go fast and straight boat" then it might be a fun boat for you.    I'm not certain on the price. It depends on the construction (fiberglass, carbon kevlar, or something more exotic?) and the condition. A carbon boat in good condition would be a steal at that price, while a patched up glass boat might not even be worth half that.

There is a small dugout store at the Stanford mall, another on Steven's Creek boulevard in Santa Clara that I have never been to, and another at Serramonte Mall in Daly City. You can find a few around San Francisco of course also. I usually just go to the dug out store at AT&T Park.

wmWrcN0faa	Kidd claims he wants to play until he's 40.  If he does that and raises his assist per game average a bit he could.  But realistically probably not.  I don't think anyone will catch Stockton for a long long time.|`|Ga11Abmzaa	Chris Paul!|`|s2gRgCZvaa	the game is much different now. stockton averaged over 12 assists a game for like 9 years. nobody even comes close to that now. i think he averaged over 15 one year. today's point guards are more scorers than stockton was. you don't find pass first point guards anymore.|`|21J0IIZbaa	Paul has a good chance to pass Stockton in assists and steals.|`|e8urANFTaa	ahah|`|8ph53q0Qaa	nash maybe depends on how long he plays. or maybe even lebron cus he does average 7 a game and he still has another like 12 years to play

Kobe Jockers get a life KING JAMES IS THE BEST|`|ST6O0oXsaa	Ok People. He wasn't even in the game at one point because he injured his ribs. Clearly that is impressive that he didn't even do while playing the entire game.  Lakers fans are just jealous.|`|jKOB7n35aa	It should have been Wallace's, but it can't be changed now.|`|CHdQqxM4aa	Yes it should as rebounds are credited to the first player that gains clear possession. Ben wallace did not have possesion, the ball technically speaking only touched him, although i understand your point of view|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Ummm... it's obvious it is!|`|VKhfrKP6aa	No but who really cares, it was about the points that night and he couldn't even pass Jordan's record when he played like the whole game and kobe only played 36 minutes and pass Jordan's and Kings records. The NBA is just trying to cover James failures.|`|WtcTBlccaa	dude give respect were respect is due you know if the numbers wer switched you would take Kobe's numbers but they're not so yes lebron had the better game you know it i know it so stop trying to find reasons|`|3teWTOPqaa	Yeah, but even without that rebound that was still a hell of a game by LeBron. But he took some bad shots in that game that could have cost them, and also the fact that the CAvs blew the Knicks out two previous times, but not on the night LeBron went off proves my point.|`|7ES4xMloaa	games over so yes

3Twg9Uuuaa	Long bows can be ambidextrous it depends on if it has a fixed arrow rest. Compound bows and most recurves have fixed arrow rests and therefore shoot only right or left handed. You need to find out which eye is the dominate eye for sighting to find out if you should get a left or right handed bow. A way to do that is to hold an object out away from your face and then bring it closer and closer following with the dominant eye will reveal which you have.|`|nMzzwrtUaa	Well a bow can be both right and left handed all you have to do is change the Components around. If you hold the bow with your right hand and draw the string back with your left that's a right handed set up and the sight and arrow reset should be on the left hand side.    If you hold the bow with your left hand and draw the string with your right that's a left handed bow set up and the sight and the arrow reset should be on the right side.|`|wVU4FpPZaa	a right handed bow is one you hold with your left, and draw with your right.  a left handed bow is one you hold with your right, and draw with your left.    if you get a right handed bow, you will need right handed accessories.

0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	Practice makes perfect, and perfecting a shot is hard at first. Here are 10 things I recommend you doing for basketball to get better.    1. Get down the form, without the form you have no chance of ever getting down, look at sources for the biggest the greatest way to shoot a good follow-through will bring good shots.    2. Take 100 shots from the same place, averagely take 2000 shots in a full practice. It might be tiring but it works well.    3. Free Throw shooting, free throws are probably the easiest shots to make but will help you make shots from that part of the court. Taking those shoots could increase your accuracy about 110%.    4. Watch the NBA, it's the perfect time and the league is heating up. Learn through watching a few games to see what they do and how they play it.     5. Basketball isn't always about shooting. Always work on the fundamentals for sure, shooting isn't the only thing you will need to work on. Do Dribbling, Jabs, lay-ups, run in between chairs while dribbling, do whatever you can to get those fundamentals down. Getting them down will increase how good you play and the way you play. (Good Dribbling workout, do a lot of two ball dribbling it helps both hands, may be difficult at first but will work. Trust me).    6. Familiarize yourself with the game, it's related to watching it but make sure you know what things mean. Look up some of the basic things you need and probably reading the Wikipedia page on basketball will blow your mind, it really helps to familiarize yourself with the game.     7. Play with other people you know, family, friends, coaches, anybody who is willing to play. One on One or a full team game, it will help you learn what you need take the shots that you need under pressure and that you can take willingly and unwillingly.     8. Know the positions, You will want to know what a Post/ Center is or a point guard. It's accordingly based on different things and the link is posted on the sources of all the positions and it will help you familiarize your self.     9. Challenge yourself with shot selection, you want to take difficult shots so that easier shots are nothing to you. Take three point shots from difficult places and you will later be guaranteed to make easier shots.     10. Don't give up, getting good at basketball takes time and exercise. It's nothing that will happen overnight, but practicing will make perfect and if you familiarize yourself with all this you won't get disappointed. Basketball is a fun sport, but when not understood it's like algebra to a Kindergartner.|`|0gWxnY0Gaa	PRACTICE    Like hard core      Running 2 or 3 miles a day, shooting 1 or 2 hours a day and practice dribbling an hour or 2 a day|`|dOelpoecaa	umm i dont know....practice lol.

If Im Phoenix I dont want Wallace or Hamilton. You dont want Wallace because he's not having a good year as it is and he's not going to help your rebounding because he stays around the 3 pt line too much. And the Suns already have enough scorers so they wouldnt need Hamilton.     The only player I'd like on the Pistons roster is Prince. And he's not good enough to trade heads up for Stat. So they'd have to include Prince and another player which I doubt they'd do. So this trade would never be worked out.|`|AwSoV5Ffaa	Sheed, Rip, and Afflolo for Amare, Tucker, and Barbosa.|`|7sEjoYvCaa	Phoenix send Shaq and Robin Lopez to Detroit for;    Rasheed Wallace  Kwame Brown  Amir Johnson|`|TrfDfpV0aa	incrediblelank-your not answering the question we don't want shaq  but anyways they should trade sheed sharpe and money with picks for amare stuckey, prince, rip and amare would be incredible in the open court

AA10228017	Shaq  Yes i do think he should have been an all star|`|SANNBvxHaa	Shaq. Wallace doesn't play as good with the Bulls. so no.|`|APyqQnfRaa	Shaq hands down, I don't think Wallace has never had a 30 point game in his life.  Granted he's the master at defense but Shaq can score, rebound, and block shots|`|9hBAfOUMaa	Shaq is so much better. HE has been having more than 20 points a game since Wade was out because of injuries. He has been having around 4-5 assists per night and about 10 rebounds per game along with a block in almost every single game. i suggest you rethink your question. Ben is a totally defensive player about 2 and a half blocks per game and good rebounds but slowed down in both categories. Doesn't score that many points per game but has been doing good without Nocioni as the Bulls center.|`|Bl3P6z3Laa	shaq because he is dominant at both ends of the floor. he is the type of player who doesnt need to touch the ball a lot ot make an impact. him simply being out on the court already makes the opposing coach sweat!!!    wallace WAS a great defensive threat when he was playing within the Detroit system. at the defensive end both in their prime were fantastic rebounders and shot blockers. let us not forget that shaq was a regular double digit rebounder to go with 2 swats a game.    wallace didnt deserve to be an all star this year. i mean, comparing him to the other big players in the eastern conference, he doesnt deserve merit over them...shaq, bosh and howard have all had better seasons then Wallace.    hopefull he wallace comes alive in the post season and shows why he was once commonly known as the Beast|`|AA10841318	ben wallace do you see him today he be up and down the court like a lamborghini|`|ca4c14cf7c84f7e2cd2bfa5c322362a0aa	Shaq is better, but he didnt deserve to play in the allstar game.

oHJ0ZEFqaa	As good as the Eagles Management have been in drafting and grooming the O and D line, they have been terrible with the skill positions. The problem with them is they got spooked with TO. Pre-TO, the Eagles were hesitant in getting people through FA with the fear that a big name will just cause problems. Then the TO controversy happened and they felt as though "I knew something like this was going to happen". Yeah they are still as uneducated as ever about providing weapons to the franchise QB.    1. Housh is a stud. He is a great possession reciever who can do some damage. He will command more attention than any of the Eagles recievers and this will also open up Westbrook. At this point any big reciever could do that. What makes this Offense run smoothly is Westbrook. But when you have small recievers who are not that physical, you don't have that go-to reciever.  Yeah they are speedy and if they get open, they can get a lot of YAC, but they need that big WR that can actually go up for catches and can out jump the coverage.    2. Will Lurie get the point? Maybe? But if I know the Eagles, they'll probably get someone like Lance Moore or Devery Henderson, another number 2-3 reciever. All Eagles Fans, including me, will be disappointed and angry that we still don't have a No. 1 reciever. Reid and Lurie will say "We are confident in this recieving core's ability to win us games". Then the Eagles will have another inconsistent season, make some type of run near the end either winning their way to another low playoff seed or barely missing it because of 1 or 2 losses earlier in the season that could have easily been won if they had that Go-to No. 1 reciever, and in the off season look back at the failed season and/or post season thinking, we just needed 1 or 2 more pieces to make it work (surprise surprise a big reciever!). (you have to agree, in the past decade, aside for maybe 1 or 2 seasons, this is the synopsis of what has happened)    Yeah it is a pretty pesssimistic outlook but after 4 failed attempts to getting to the big one, and 1 loss at the big one, it's kind of hard to think otherwise of this team. I love the emotion but I hate the sheer stupidity of the organization.|`|XLXncQu9aa	I think the Eagles would be best served to trade or pick up Houshmanzadeh.  The thing is that the Eagles haven't had a dominant WR since T.O.  The only WR they have that can draw away the coverage from other receivers is Desean Jackson.  That is one thing the Eagles have lacked and that is a go to receiver in 3rd and long situations.  I think T.J is a great WR that can win in the right atmosphere.  The Eagles are a few steps away from winning a championship.  T.J has a right to going where a team is actually winning.  The Bengals lack accountability and they aren't anywhere near being a playoff berth.  They will probably be 7-9 next season.  My point is I think Jeff Laurie should sign him if he knows what is best for his franchise.  They need a big play receiver and they need to address the issues on defense.  If they get T.J and get their defense back to playing tough then they will be ready to win a championship next year.|`|a6EndAPiaa	I think it would be a great idea for the Eagles to get him.  However, there will be competition for him.  The Redskins need a receiver and when the Redskins are involved in a free agent the other teams had better pry open their wallets -- no I have no information that suggest the Redskins are going to go after T.J. other than the fact that the Redskins need another WR.|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	They probably should. Basket's probably gone in free agency, Curtis is more of a  3 WR, and they need someone to start opposite Jackson. Also, if they don't sign T.J., it's rumored that the Giants may be interested in him.    Another name I'm hearing about going to Philly is Tony Gonzalez, who supposedly wants to be traded out of KC. That would give McNabb another reliable target, as L.J. Smith hasn't been getting it done, although they'd have to give KC something in return for him.|`|4kdlE54Paa	TJ Houshmanzadeh would be good for the Eagles.  He would deflect attention away fro DeSean Jackson and vise versa.  He could definitely be the key piece to help the offense.  This would even affect the running game in a positive way too.    Will Jeff Lurie get the point?  Hard to say.  To him, the Eagles are successful where they are at.  For the most part, the Eagles have been successful, but have just fell short in the playoffs many times in the last few years.    I know that many Eagle fans believe that it is win it all or nothing so I can understand your frustration.  Houshmanzadeh would be the key piece as long as they keep the same team minus a couple of WRs to breathe some cap room and roster spots.    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	I would do what I could, if I was the Eagles organization, to try to obtain Houshmandzadeh and at the same time keep my 1st round pick. If such a deal couldn't be done, I wouldn't look further into him. The Eagles receiver situation was poor this past year but that had more to do with injuries than anything else. They have bigger areas of need.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	I think it would be an incredible fit.    But knowing them they'll try to nab another cornerback when they're already ridiculously stacked at that position.|`|MbcvI1A9aa	housmandzadeh is what the eagles need. if they can pick him up he would make a major impact. if houshmandzadeh signs with them losing the nfc championship game would be a disappointment.|`|B8sJEBxTaa	He also said that he liked Rex Grossman. He obviously does not know what he's saying.|`|tNerdFYsaa	They NEED to get him!!! First of all, Mcnabb is still great! the guy gets blamed for everything and they gave him a "real" receiver for one year and look what happened? as you said a super bowl apperance. What was his second best receiver? Todd Pinkston? They need to man up and finally understand that all they are missing is that one little spot, a dominant WR. I think they will try to go out and get him but im not sure if Cincy won't try with all there power to keep him. He's the real deal, better than ocho cinco|`|5etFAmrsaa	No, Their the Eagles they never want to give DMac weapons for some odd reason.|`|qJaM0AY8aa	yea that would be good, but Boldin and chad johnson will possibly be on the trading block this off season, and i beleive both of them (expecially boldin) are better than tj. (even tho chad had a bad season, so did every other bengal)    just my 2 cents

A couple seasons ago when he was healthy and had a good team around him, he was a top 5 quarterback. This year I don't think he was even in the top 20.    The Rams need to fix the offensive line for Bulger to be successful, as the problems they've had there not only limit his effectiveness, they also limit his ability to stay healthy.

He can barely move these days and his arm is on the decline. Its not like he makes the best decisions ethier.....  He has only played 16 games once, and his career will be shortned by that swiss cheese line. Hes a very generic pocket QB that doesnt wow you with anything.    I think these guys are better personally    1. Peyton Manning (if you dont think so, your clueless)  2. Tom Brady (if healthy can give peyton a run for the top spot)  3. Kurt Warner (if he comes back he can dominate)  4. Drew Brees (hes on the right team to throw for 5,000 again)  5. Phillip Rivers (accurate as hell)  6. Tony Romo (if he stays away from Cabo)  7. Donovan Mcnabb (more of a pocket qb now, still good)  8. Carson Palmer (if healthy)  9. Jay cutler (young brett favre)  10. Aaron Rodgers (this guy is legit)  11. Ben Roethlisberger (slightly overrated look at his D, but good)  12. Eli Manning (he should be in his prime now)  13. Chad pennington (i hate him but he wins games, no mistakes)  14. Matt Ryan (matty ice has superstar potential)  15. Jason Campbell (solid qb, makes few mistakes, can run)  16. Brett Favre (if he comes back healthy)  17. Joe Flacco (best arm in the league sorry cutler, tons of upside)  18. Matt Schaub (good if he can stay healthy)  19. David Garrard (good arm, legs, could make better decesions)  20. Matt Cassel (havent seen enough of him to believe that hes really that good and its not just the fact he was on the patriots last year)|`|4kdlE54Paa	As of right now, he ranks between the top 15 to 20, but that has a lot to do because of the poor protection from his O line.  The O line is just not giving enough time for the WRs to get open and for Bulger to throw.  People quickly forgot how well he did in 2006 with the proper protection.

z6JExf0faa	All AFL clubs take the pre-season competition seriously.  However not all want to win the event.  The most important thing is to test untried and/or younger players against quality opposition in close to match conditions.    As for injuries, they can occur at any time.  It could be in a pre-season game or even an intraclub trial game.  It could happen in training or as in the case of Graham Polak out on the town.  You can't wrap the players up in cotton wool.|`|YcvKwRqiaa	The majority of teams will see the NAB cup as a chance to give the younger players some match practice. The few that take it seriously will go far and may even end up winning it. Carlton was one of those teams that took it seriously, although I don't know if they will this year. I'm hoping they focus more on the regular season.|`|kJhZx5Mcaa	They should just scrap it. The NAB Cup is a waste of time. Because a team like Melbourne West Coast or Fremantle might win it and they are all going to finish the season proper in the bottom 4.|`|94d210326a19c672cd98b1a32e43da78aa	Without the pre season comp teams would still be playing each other in what they call 'trials'. Every team needs to experiment and get match fitness and the NAB cup provides this opportunity. It is not a waste of time but no team other than maybe the Demons would risk 4 points in the real comp just to win the NAB cup.    Great organised comp to test your squad but no team other than the really bad ones take it seriously.|`|mXFOru11aa	kangas:3/10 seriosness carlton 10/10|`|2s244jGgaa	West Coast have never really taken it seriously at all.

Im so excited to see the likes of Will Sullivan and Lewis Stevenson, Sullivan is a great ruckman and is just 2cm shorter than Cox and stevenson is an explosive midfielder.

And give them some game experience (=|`|WifhQyD4aa	I think all teams take it more seriously now than what they used to, as the money is quite good for those teams that progress each round.    I also still feel it gives the teams a chance to see the young players and how they handle themselves in tougher competition against other sides. I agree that injuries could be harmful to a side but all teams want their players to be match fit for the start of the season.|`|4wRyTY9Raa	The NAB cup is a waste of time, the only good thing about it is if your team keeps winning they get to play on the best grounds and you get to see them on tv.|`|7Ek9YkUhaa	Not very seriously, just game time for the younger ones.    Sam Butler  Brad Ebert  Andrew Embley (?)  Ash Hansen  Adam Hunter  Jamie McNamara  Mark LeCras  Matt Rosa  Adam Selwood  Beau Waters  Tyson Stenglein  David Wirrpanda    Most of these players, if not all, would be in our best 22. Not one of them is listed to play in the clash with the pies today.  It doesn't bother me if we lose, we going in against a very stong Collingwood side, just want to see the young boys and the competitive spirit they show.

Kej0WbA5aa	My best friend and I have these discussion every week. He hates. He is a die hard Clemson fan, and hates tommy Bowdem. HE and I swear the only reason he beats Florida State is 2 reason 1. His job is in trouble, and 2. Florida state sucks that year. Clemson has 2 of the best running backs , and a offensive utility player in Jacobe Ford. the quarterback isn't bad, and the Offense isn't bad. the Special teams is awful, and when for some reason when Clemson has a lead they go to a Zone defense, and blow games. As far as recruting goes, South Carolina is recruiting a lot of the same people, If we lose it's because we got beat by a better team Tommy Bowden is just getting out coached.|`|x58OSYyaaa	He has done a great job with what he has to work with.|`|ea133ef3da2315aab8f63cce7701c216aa	Perhaps it's not him but the pool of local talent surrounding him now.

En cierto modo es cierto, los jovenes hoy dia no le ponen entusiasmo, pero creo qq hay otivos acerca de esto. Antes el practicante de artes marciales lo hacia porq en realidad lo sentia como necesidad espiritual. Hoy dia los chicos (muchos de ellos) lo hacen por una necesidad, por seguridad, o porq un amigo empezo entonces el va a ir a ver q es eso... y asi dejan tambien.  Pero es cierto tambien q hoy los jovenes no tienen entusiasmo por NADA, sino mira cuantos terminan el colegio (si es q terminan) y cuantos van a la universidad a estudiar y convertirse en profesionales...   O sino fijate cuantos "trabajan"... Si agarran algun trabajito y les dura lo q aguan entre los dedos. PEro no creo q sea solo culpa de ellos, sino q fueron educados de esa forma, eso es lo q les inculcaron ser en la vida. Y no van a cambiasr esto para apunarse en un arte marcial.  Esa es mi humilde opinion. Pero se que aun somos muchos los jovenes q realmente nos interesamos en las artes marciales, en explorar nuestros limites y capacidades. Lo digo yo, con mis 18 a?os...  ADIOS!|`|UjWblu1Jaa	y mira hay mucha violencia y los chicos utilizan las artes marciales como provocacion y no como defensa como lo era antes y por eso los padres o no los mandan o no quieren ir|`|qCHIoxQmaa	me parece que estas viendo todo alrevesk, uno no aprende artes marciales para pelear, todo lo contrario lo hace para dejar de hacerlo o mejor para no hacerlo nunca, ese no es el fin,no es superar a los demas, uno no le tiene que demostrar nada a nadie, lo que haga se lo tiene que demostrar a s mismo, autosuperarse dia a dia, miedos, temores debilidades, etc etc.  "el que supera a los demas es fuerte, el que se supera asi mismo es poderoso",  lo otro queda para ultimo recurso, cuando esta en peligro nuestra integridad. Pero no por eso hay que exponerla al da?o para poder pelear.

nZbPpuOoaa	Amigo Raul,    Esta vez no voy a coincidir contigo.     Asdasda hay de ambas, el TKD que conocemos normalmente hace uso solamente de la piernas y esto lo pone en desventaja frente a otras Artes Marciales, es por eso que los practicantes conjugan las Artes Marciales, por ejemplo el TKD lo complementan con Judo, por poner un ejemplo. Aplicar la tcnica correcta en el momento correcto es lo ideal, el problema esta en que el TKD que conocemos no tiene ni proyecciones ni luxaciones, y como sabrs la mayora de los combates terminan en el suelo, por lo que el TKD tal y como lo conocemos esta en desventaja.    Estamos de acuerdo, verdad?|`|f4f8ee0c61bd85316490c6cf5ad04815aa	El Tae sirve y sirve muy bien yo practiqu desde los 5 hasta los 15 y aun sigo aplicando lo que aprend que es disciplina, constancia y control de las emociones ese es el fondo verdadero de  un arte marcial no el andar golpeando gente.|`|QhNhWTEiaa	sirve como toda arte marcial,pero tambien como cualquier arte marcial deben ser bien utilizadas sus tecnicas.

Saludos|`|2be02b3440bbadb725c4dc8e865e5656aa	El TKD es como toda arte marcial, diciplina y tecnica de combate, el inicio del TKD es muy remoto pero es asta el siglo pasado que pudo ser aprovado y considerarce como un deporte y un arte marcial, cuando Corea obtuvo su independencia, pero retomando el tema, el TKD es una muy buena arte marcial, no solo para defenza sino como una diciplina, ya que se aprende el control de las emociones, el control del cuerpo y de las tecnicas. Pero en verdad te dire que hace tiempo no se realizan muchos torneos abiertos a las artes marciales, porque son diferentes reglas y tecnicas, y si es como un deporte se tiene que tomar en cuenta que lo que se busca es aprender no lastimar, cuando existe un seudodeporte en el cual lo que se hace es lastimar al oponente este deja de tener sentido, porque esto ya no es deporte, recuerda las maximas de las olimpidas, citius, altius, fortius y lo importante es competir en armonia.  Bueno para dejar el rollo existen campeones mundiales de TKD en categoria abierta es decir en torneos mundiales de artes marciales, como ejemplo Ramiro Guzman e Isaias Due?as, pero en el momento en que el TKD se diversifico y se convirtio en un deporte olimpico, los torneos por lo general solo se hacen dentro de la diciplina entre diferentes asociaciones.  Como ultimo comentario yo practico TKD desde los 10 a?os, pero dice mi tio que cuando el lo empeso a practicar hace ya mas de 25 a?os los torneos eran diferentes, no se utilizaba ninguna proteccion como ahora, y habian golpes que desaparecieron a raiz de que el TKD entro en las olimpiadas como deporte, es decir que no es la tecnica sino la adecuacion a un deporte lo que cambio el TKD, pero si se utiliza bien sigue siendo letal, como para los antiguos soldados coreanos.|`|DnYPhPYVaa	Esta vez no estoy de acuerdo con mi amigo Raul M.  Yo practiqu Taekwondo y ahora practico el metodo KEYSI que es la suma de Jeet kune do, Thai boxing,Brazilian Ju Jitsu,artes marciales filipinas(incluyen armas blancas) y varias ms.  Es efectivo el Taekwondo en la calle si tienes espacio para lanzar las patadas preferentemente a los genitales y a las rodillas,pero contra otras artes marciales carecen de repertorio (corta distancia o suelo).  En el muay thai trabajas mucho la corta distancia y los golpes de codo y rodilla son muy efectivas,pero no trabajan el suelo,as que si se caen estn en desventaja frente al Judo o el Jujitsu.  A mi juicio un arte marcial debera ser efectivo en todas las distancias y lo ms real posible,sin adornos,pues en la calle llevas zapatos,vaqueros,el suelo resbala y lo ms importante..ARMAS   Si aprendes a utilizar por ejemplo un bolgrafo o un cinturn como arma tienes clara ventaja.|`|b075fb0d50b225eca178fe56ce72693eaa	Esto ocurre mas por su proyeccion como deporte y la "pasteurizacion" que en consecuencia se dio en el takkion, que es su origen, pero la eficacia de una disciplina esta en la mente del practicante, no en el arte.

Si uno hace un anlisis de los pumse ver la multiplicidad de tcnicas que pueden combinarse empero muchos memorizan esas tcnicas simplemente como una coreografa, necesaria para aprobar un examen y as quedan limitados a un Bandal Chagui con lo cual, evidentemente, muy poco pueden hacer fuera de un torneo bajo el reglamento de TKD|`|cde69ce736eb308fdb6c14cfa41eb015aa	Hola     Tendria que ver que campeonatos hablas yo difiero contigo yo lo he visto al reves de lo que tu comentas.    yo tengo conocimiento de campeonatos mundiales de artes marciales donde el Tae Kwon Do sale mejor librado de todas las especialidades marciales.    creo que el Tae Kwon Do ha evolucionado mucho como arte marcial y en el aspecto deportivo es de mayor aceptacion  tenido en los ultimos a?os por lo tanto ha tenido muchos exponentes buenos.    tanbien hay que ver que campeonatos hablas por que igual yo he podido tener la oportunidad donde hacen torneos donde se concentran escuelas patitos que nada que ver y se ponen a competir entre si por que no tiene invitacion a grandes torneos y de prestiguio    yo he estado prensentes en los abiertos de estados unidos no te imaginas el numero competitivo de personas.    ahi es donde se puede definir quien es quien y salir triunfador si que cuesta,solo los mejores y mejor preparados salen triunfadores.    solo lo mejor preparados y que lo hicieron con responsabilidad.    eso si te lo digo cualquier arte marcial es buena y cualquiera que practiques te dara una satisfacion plena.    sobre cual es la mejor arte marcial cientificamente no puede ser puede ser el practicante el arte marcial esta ahi y si lo practico mal podre ser el mejor claro que no   yo creo que todas las artes son buenas un ejemplo claro es Norris fue campeon mundial de artes marciales y practico lo que es arte marcial Coreano donde quedo las otras artes marciales pero les digo depende mucho tambien de los exponentes   otra cosa casi todos los artes marciales utilizan casi todas las partes del cuerpo como arte marcial no como deporte     saludos

And what side are you taking Lebrons or Jordans?|`|A2XI4m0Aaa	The problem with this is that you have no argument at all. MJ was  clutch. He made the shots he needed to make. If the Bulls  were losing by one point in the final seconds, and MJ had the ball you knew the Bulls were going to win. Lebron is not capable of hitting big-time shots. Also, his jump shot at any time is not consistent. Also, Michael Jordan played on both ends of the court. Lebron has no defensive intensity. So Michael Jordan>Lebron on offense. Michael Jordan>Lebron on defense. No contest.|`|6UDgnVgXaa	if it was lebron vs. mj in a 1 on 1 game, mj would win like 21-12.  lebron is great now and will be forever, and probably one of the top 10 players of all time. but mj is and always will be the best.      i would use that as some type of conclusion thing. i dont have any stats|`|okb8418Eaa	You have no speech.

He also plays in a more talented era, came strait out of high school, was rookie of the year, 1st overall pick, and the youngest player to win the all star mvp award.  Hope I help!|`|b5efksjkaa	Well, he did say he has to write on something MOST people will disagree on. With that in mind... I also disagree with your point, so you've picked a good topic. Unfortunately, it's pretty hard to make a case for anyone ending their careers better than MJ's. The guy is only the most coveted athlete of his time. You can say that James is bigger and stronger than Jordan. That he has the body of a power forward, but moves like a 2-guard. That he signed some crazy deal with NIKE before he even entered the league. That this shoe contract is bigger than any other basketball player in history. You can say that he had a better body than most NBA players when he was a senior in high school. That most critics picked him to be the successor of Jordan. Yea, I know they've picked a ton other guys to succeed Jordan. You can say that James have Magic's passing skills in addition to Jordan's explosiveness. That he can play 3 positions not just 2 (like MJ). Good luck!|`|7mOp8teNaa	lebron would win i love the cavaliers

Sheed, Rip, Chauncey and Tayshaun did a great job covering for his lack of offensive ability with thier talent.     that's gone now, and he's on a very young team. the Bulls are talented, but not matured enough to play at the level the Pistons do. youth and passion are no substitution for years of experience and knowledge of the game.

I'm sure him losing has something to do with it, but even then, B Wallace was very close to his team mates, making jokes on the court, laughing, and that will make him to better. It doesn't look like he's having too fun on the court when he's playing with the Bulls.

twP5G2g1aa	Hola Uno  esta pregunta es muy comn mira las artes marciales son como un llamado yo mas que decirte esta disciplina o la otra te recomendara que siguieras tu instinto te gusta el Capoeira acude  algn entrenamiento pero ese da esfuerzate si es lo tuyo te sentirs feliz si no sigue buscando eso si no le quites el tiempo a tus condiscpulos y el maestro no hay nada peor que alguien que asiste a un dojo con falta de espiritu e indiciplinado se siempre respetuoso y observa, nadie de nosotros podemos aconsejarte bien ya que no estamos en tu circunstancia solamente podemos hablar desde nuestra experiencia suerte :-)|`|DnYPhPYVaa	Para practicar la Capoeira tu fisico no debe ser un impedimento, otra cosa seria que este arte no te satisfaga por completo.  Dadas tus caracteristicas (alto y flexible) el Taekwondo se te deberia dar bien.Las clases son muy dinamicas y aunque sin llegar al Full  Contact  tambien tienen contacto.  Es importante que tengas un buen maestro en el arte marcial que elijas.Hay maestros con muchos titulos que no son capaces de transmitir su arte,simplemente es que no se les da bien ense?ar.  Yo te recomendaria que visitaras varios gimnasios y que primero veas una clase para saber si te puede gustar o no.  Otros artes marciales que te puedo recomendar (a mi gusto) son:  -Brazilian Jujitsu o Judo (de suelo)  -Kung fu o Karate (tradicionales)  -Hapkido y Aikido (luxaciones)  -Jeet kune do y Keysis fighting metod (evolutivos)  Yo particularmente practico el Keysi.  Suerte.|`|nk87LqDdaa	Bueno... a mi me llamaba mucho la atencin el kempo; me parece que existen dos corrientes (la oriental y la occidental) y tengo entendido que la occidental es ms explosiva.    Creo que podra gustarte porque es un arte marcial muy rpido y te ense?an a golpear, a usar armas y a hacer agarres.    Por otro lado, yo practico aikido. Es un arte marcial muy fluido y armnico (de hecho 'ai' viene de armona) que busca tanto la cuestin de la defensa personal como el balance mente-cuerpo-espritu. Es muy interesante, pero en vez de ense?arte a golpear, te ense?an a estar en balance contigo mismo y a defenderte sometiendo a tu oponente sin entrar en batalla.    Espero que encuentres algo acorde a tus gustos. Saludos!|`|sXKSUdJnaa	practica kung fu!|`|5N0k55Pxaa	EN PRIMER LUGAR, NO TE PIERDAS EL LIBRO DEL NINJA DEL CANTANTE DE LOS MOJINOS ESCOCIOS.

Yo tengo menos edad y soy mas bajito que tu, todavia me queda bastante por crecer, pero mi hermano mayor mide 1'87 y la altura no le dificulta para nada hacer capoeira, aunque pesa bastante menos (78 kilos) Pero todo es probar, quizas tu tienes fuerza necesaria para manter tu peso y como dices si eres flexible eso facilita mucho las cosas.

ZRYk4Qosaa	Hola  Si las considero artes marciales, o si no por lo menos artes de combate (que para mi son lo mismo, artes de guerra) y aunque muchos fanaticos tradicionalistas se empe?en en llamar artes marciales solamente a los sistemas orientales, a manera personal me parece que es tanto como decir que solamente la escultura o la pintura de origen oriental son la unica forma de arte que existe, y francamente no es asi.  Todas las disciplinas que mencionan tienen un metodo, una disciplina a seguir, formas de ejecucion correctas y aplicaciones practicas en una pelea realista, asi que por tanto se merecen ser designados como arte marcial, aunque en el caso del Kickboxing sea mas como una reglamentacion y adaptacion moderna del occidente  del arte original del Muay Thai, que en nuestros dias se practica siguiendo algunos de los metodos tradicionales pero ya no tan encaminado a la guerra como en sus origenes, en cuanto a las otras dos disciplinas indudablemente que las considero artes marciales, si no solo basta rastrear su antiguedad.  Suerte|`|NxLWsSj8aa	no. son deportes de contacto|`|AA11481777	Tecnicamente lo son, ya que son un estilo de peleas un reglas   definidas y tecnicas, lo que las diferencia de una pelea callejera  y aunque muchos lo contradigan por no enfocarse en la parte   espiritual y no tener una vasta historia, estos no son verdaderos  requisitos para que sean llamados artes marciales, o al menos en el verdadero espa?ol, no en el que ellos creen saber, busca en wikipedia y veraz|`|cb9274dac4712df6c1f001c7213582beaa	claro que si!! son hasta mas importantes que otras, dada su antiguedad!    yo en lo personal practico mma, y las 3 que nombraste son bsicas y definitivas.|`|xbJzWTg5aa	de esas solo el kick boxing, los otros son solo deportes de contacto, para ser art marcial se necesita cierta cultura detras de ellas, ademas d q son algo mas de estudiadas que esas dos, yo digo q para ser arte marcial necesita cierto esquema|`|f93ba6acaa1716bf0daadba0bd90c9bbaa	Boxeo y Lucha Grecorromana s entran en la categora, en el entendido que son derivacin y/o evolucin del Pugilato ( el Boxeo) y del Pancratos (la Grecorromana). El Kick boxing es una adaptacin que hicieron los gringos para que se puedieran hacer competencias como deporte de Artes Marciales muy complejas para calificar tcnica y contacto, cosa que luego se hizo. Apenas el domingo pasado lea en un peridico que el Kick Boxing no es un Arte Marcial ni un deporte, sino una manera de hacer ejercicio de alta intensidad, y de paso aprender a defenderse, cosa con al que no estoy de acuerdo. El punto es que al no haber una serie de rituales, jerarquas, graduacin sistematizada, no entra en las disciplinas. Adems, lo que hace que no se considere como Arte Marcial, para finalizar, que ellos mismos se consideran deportistas antes que artista marciales, y eso es algo de mucho peso.|`|a54ac3de2c14da047ffdd77867c80711aa	No porque carecen de un sentido etico-filosofico que todas las artes marciales tienen, son solo deportes de contacto.|`|iyG9FfxBaa	hola amigo  en mi humilde opinion:     el kick boxing, el full contact, el savate, el box, la lucha grecorromana, etc..... las consider? unicamente como DEPORTES DE CONTACTO, ya que aunque tuvieron sus raices en las artes marciales (karate japones, taekwon do coreano, kung fu chino, muay thai tailandes, etc...) son solo un conjunto de tecnicas combativas para poder estar arriba de un ring y dar espectaculo al aficionado    En las escuelas de kick, boz o full, solo entrenas una serie de ejercicios tanto de golpeo, como de pateo, resistencia, elasticidad, combate en ring, pegarle al saco etc.... unicamente para poder rendir arriba de un cuadrilatero y ganar bolsas de dinero o algun otro premio en ese espectaculo parecido a los de boxeo.    OJO.. PERO NO ME MALENTIENDAS AMIGO... QUE TAMBIEN LOS DEPORTES DE CONTACTO  SON BUENOS AL IGUAL QUE LAS ARTES MARCIALES PARA ADQUIRIR DICIPLINA, AUTOCONOCIMINETO, SUPERACION PERSONAL, ETC.... pero con las diferencias que ya te aclare.    nota: si escribo con desconocimiento de causa y eludi algun punto importante por favor haganmelo saber para asi poder estar mejor informado sobre estos deportes de contacto.    gracias y abrazo con palmada.

Bien, en ese video puedes apreciar que el boxeador no se sabe parar las patadas bajas asi que, por mucho que lo supere en tecnica de boxeo al no poder defenderse de lo que le tira el oponente no consigue acercarse a una distancia en la que puede usar sus pu?os. Saca tus propias conclusiones.      P.D.: hablamos de una pelea en un ring no de una callejera, asi que sobran esas alusiones en las que se afirma que ganaria el que antes le pegase un tiro al otro, o el que tuviese mas amigos, etc, etc...|`|ZRYk4Qosaa	Hola  Yo creo que ganaria el que tenga mas resistencia para los golpes, que este mas preparado, que tenga mas experiencia y que tenga mas actitud a la hora de combatir (suponiendo que ambos son del peso), porque dificilmente creo que un peleador de ningun arte marcial se va a poner a pelear contra alguien excesivamente mas pesado (los dias del autentico UFC acabaron) y para cada combate existen reglas, (incluso un combate sin reglas lleva una implicita)  Ahora hay algo que muchos de los que respondieron no tomo en cuenta, en realidad va a ser igual de agil un hombre de 95kg aunque los dos fueran del mismo estilo? (box o arte marcialista oriental) porque muchas de las tecnicas que yo conozco de Kung Fu estan practicamente dise?adas para alguien esbelto y agil, o con muchisimos a?os de experiencia  y las tecnicas del boxeo son facilmente ejecutables por cualquiera sin importar peso y talla, ademas de que mucha gente tiene la falsa imagen de que un boxeador solo sabe usar los pu?os, y nada mas lejos de la verdad, un boxeador es un peleador tan completo como cualquiera, por que el trabajo de piernas que realiza esta enfocado en hacerlo mantener el balance correcto y golpear con maxima potencia a la vez que le permite esquivar los posibles ataques, ademas que un boxeador experimentado puede aprender a patear y defenderse de patadas mucho mas facil que una persona promedio y entonces las cosas cambian notablemente. Si es verdad existe una ventaja para el peleador que domine el combate a ras de suelo y las patadas, pero no crees que el boxeador tiene la misma ventaja si llega a conectar de lleno a un peleador de cualquier estilo? y teniendo en cuenta lo adiestrados que tienen los pu?os no seria raro si esto ocurriera.  Al final de cuentas no creo que dependa del estilo ni los antecedentes de cada peleador sino de sus caracteristicas personales y las circunstancias particulares de la pelea.

Mira todas son buenas segn la situacin, pero hay que ver que es lo que estas buscando tu, segn tu pregunta no creo que ests pensando en pasar muchos a?os aprendiendo y mucho menos dedicarle la vida, as que no te voy a recomendar ningn Arte Marcial las cuales  invierten mucho tiempo en prepararte para que puedas estar en un nivel adecuado para que te defiendas en la calle, yo te recomendara cualquier tipo de Defensa Personal, en la que con solo algunos meses de entrenamiento ya estas mejor preparado para repeler alguna agresin.       Suerte y si puedo ayudarte en algo mas estoy a tu disposicin.|`|c278b712ce63d95a527817b15a9cd740aa	Lo mejor para defenderse es salir corriendo lo ms rpido que puedas, siempre hay que evitar cualquier situacin de peligro, el hecho que sepas artes marciales no te hace invensible.  Cualquier arte marcial que decidas practicar es buena para la defensa, despus de todo ese es el objetivo con el que fueron creadas, no? Cada una va a darte habilidades diferentes, slo depende de vos hacerla realmente efectiva o no, es decir, vos pods practicar el arte marcial que consideres ms efectiva o completa, pero si no sos constante en la practica, no te va a servir de nada.  Yo practiqu muchos a?os karate y hace 2 , aikido asi que si me peds una opinin sobre cual me parece que es la mejor (para m) es el aikido, pero porque me encanta y yo la encuentro efectiva, eso si, requiere muchisima prctica y constancia. Pero la practica en el dojo no es la vida real, por lo tanto no s si ante alguna situacin podr aplicar lo que s de forma efectiva.  Por eso mi recomendacin es que practiques el arte marcial que a vos realmente te guste, y vas a ver que cualquiera que elijas va a ser buena para defenderte en caso que necesites hacerlo.|`|7806020d114491c88ed1d129bae85b00aa	tai kuando,muai tai|`|xbJzWTg5aa	todas las artes marciales son buenas, no hay ninguna que sea mala, si lo fueran simplemente ya no serian artes marciales pues estos deportes todos son considerados para pelear y hace mucho tiempo para la guerra, escoje el que mas te llame la atencion, y veras que sera efectivo solo asegurate de que el lugar este certificado y registrado en alguna asociancion, por ejemplo el karate en la federacion mexico-japon de karate o cosas asi|`|sXKSUdJnaa	kung fu ya que esa es su base principal! si necesitas mi ayuda mi msn es donandres69@hotmail.com|`|AA11481777	ninjitsu, copiaste mi avatar :P|`|jSbmxRFgaa	PARA MI EL MEJOR ARTE MARCIAL PARA DEFENDERSE, ES SENCILLAMENTE: la inteligencia, saludos|`|NRoHoV7faa	para mi el taekuondo, ya que se utilizan tcnicas simples donde rapidamente (o sea sin tanto tiempo de prctica) pueden ser utilizadas para defensa personal.

Me temo que no fuste especfico con tu pregunta.  Pero hay una gran cantidad de formas de ataque y defensa.  Slo debes saber a que te refieres.  Supongo que ests hablando de la vida real, de esos momentos en donde tu integridad depende de que actues de alguna forma en especial ?no?   Pues como vers, en este foro es muy difcil que encuentres lo que necesitas, aqu la mayora creen que haber entrenado con tal o cual, ser portadores de una cinta o distincin "honorfica", y haber ganado algunos "combates" con personas bajo un ambiente controlado, les hace invencibles y una especie de sabios combativos.  Llevo casi dos meses buscando cordura y seriedad en este foro y lo nico que he encontrado son fantasas, faltas de respeto por las verdaderas Artes Marciales, auto enga?o, debilidad mental, un par de retos concretados de fulanos practicantes "serios" (que para mi terminaron siendo un par de payasos) y muy molestos porque ofendo a sus dignas "Artes" y un par de nuevos amigos que entienden a lo que me refiero al verdadero significado, origen y uso de las Artes Marciales, incluso uno de ellos vendr a Mxico y tendremos el gusto de tener un encuentro entre verdaderos practicantes.  Ahora que... si lo que quieres es unirte a la comunidad de las fantasias y te gusta vivir al "lmite".  Comprate un cinto negro y pntelo en la cintura cuando te encuentres en peligro, parece que a muchos de aqui les ha funcionado.  Yo te invito a que busques la manera de ilustrarte un poco ms en el tema, las Artes Marciales comprenden una ENORME cantidad de disciplinas, de las cuales todos tenemos facilidad para desarrollar algunas cuantas, no todas, no existe nadie capz de hacerlo.  Una vez que las habilidades por las cuales tienes una mayor facilidad de desarrollo hayan sido reconocidas en t.  Bueno... pues haz todo el esfuerzo posible por aprender y explotar tu potencial.  Por desgracia ya no soy maestro, de lo contrario te invitara a mi Dojo antes de que aquellos parsitos te laven la mente.  Pero en verdad te invito a que empieces por aprender el significado de Artes Marciales, literalmente.  Ya que tengas el conocimiento necesario para diferenciar entre las Artes Marciales y las Tcnicas de Pelea, entonces busca aquello que vaya de acuerdo a tu personalidad, a tus deseos, tus habilidades y a tus metas.  Yo te deseo xito y espero que busques entender y razonar, antes de envolverte en prcticas que slo benefician al que te imparte las clases.  Es muy importante que aprendas a diferenciar entre un verdadero maestro y un excelente charlatn.  La mejor de las suertes.

He conocido a diversos instructores que han aprendido de maestros chinos y ciertamente mantienen un sentido marcial de las cosas porque el deportivo es relativamente nuevo (la sanda, modalidad deportiva del wushu o kungfu tiene 30 a?os de haber sido creada) por tanto a lo mejor en 50 o 60 a?os se crean estilos ligeros de kungfu, lo cual en mi opinion es vlido, pero no como para suplir 3,000 a?os de sabiduria en defensa personal y arte marcial.

Hay que aclarar que el Kung Fu no es un Arte Marcial, esto es un error, si gustas mas informacin al respecto puedes ver en estas direcciones http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_F%C3%B...  http://www.galeon.com/jlgarcia/KungFu/ke...  http://www.habana.jovenclub.cu/santacruz...  http://www.kungfu-kehsiao.com/  http://ernesmena.spaces.live.com/  Para no entrar en detalles.     Retomando tu pregunta, el mal llamado Kung Fu como todas las Artes Marciales han sido victimas de la mercadotecnia perdiendo su esencia, por culpa de maestros inescrupulosos. El tal Kung Fu ya lo puedes encontrar deportivo y ahora lo hacen llamar Kung Fu-Wushu cuando son dos trminos completamente diferentes, pero eso es materia para otra pregunta.     Para estas en vigencia y ganar adeptos una milenaria Arte Marcial que se mantuvo en secreto por miles de a?os, en nuestros das anda en minifalda por la calle y ense?ando sus pechos, para ganar clientes y aceptacin popular, ya los tiempos de hacer correr la sangre pasaron, muy violento para los miembros del comit panamericano y olmpico, por eso le ponen guantes y mil protecciones mas.     En realidad la culpa no es de ningn directivo, al final estos solo buscan llenar sus bolsillos, la culpa es de los falsos maestros que por alcanzar nombre y admiracin difaman, mienten y deshonran a tan excepcional Arte Marcial.    Mi maestro siempre lo dice: El Kehsiao duele    El peligro lo veo en los alumnos que deseosos de aprender la novedad acuden a seudo escuelas, con flamantes seudo maestros, que les ense?an resplandecientes saltos y volteretas que no son ms que una falsa, debido a su escaso conocimiento tcnico e histrico.

Suerte y si puedo ayudarte en algo mas estoy a tu disposicin.|`|BGT7IAKiaa	esta considerado una filosofia|`|hdLDbojBaa	No se porque te quejas el Kung Fu es muy buena arte marcial proveniente de China y es muy deportivo el karate y el tae kwon do tambien no entiendo porque quieren estar dando marometas y volteretas en el aire a lo tonto ese no es el punto de las artes marciales.  Y si hablas de campeonatos no se el Kung Fu es muy buen arte marcial.|`|KgtXjEsVaa	Saludos:  Hasta donde tengo entendido el Kung Fu ha dejado de ser parte fundamental del combate cuerpo a cuerpo de las fuerzas armadas de China.  ?Ellos ya han buscado actualizarse, que esperas para hacer lo mismo?|`|iyG9FfxBaa	Que hay Roland.... antes que nada gracias por darme tu opinion en la pregunta que formule anterior a la tuya.    Bueno, tengo que decir, que desgraciadamente el kung fu o wu shu tambien ha perdido parte de su gran repertorio marcial al igual que el karate y el taekwondo, pero eso no es culpa del kung fu mismo .    Pienso que es culpa de aquellos maestros que solo se dejan llevar por las ganancias vanales que dan el convertir la practica verdadera de las artes marciales chinas a transformalas en combates deportivos y exibicion de keuns  o taolus.  Estos maestros, en sus escuelas, solo fomentan un entrenamiento dirigido a los torneos, o sea, supliendo riquisimo arsenal tecnico de las artes marciales chinas y su correcta aplicacion , a solo ense?ar tecnicas que sirvan para puntuar en los combates deportivos, o en el llamado "SANDA", el cual tambien va con un  reglamento totalmente deportivo y hasta con protecciones para la integridad de sus participantes.    En el caso de tao lu,(katas chinas para los no entendidos), no puedo opinar, creo que por tradicion china, si habia torneos de katas de kung fu desde la antiguedad, pero no se como se manejaban.    Pero lo bueno es que todavia hay escuelas y maestros de kung fu que no se han dejado llevar por dicha corriente deportiva, y sus clases creeme amigo, son de una calidad indiscutible en cuanto a filosofia y ense?anzade artes marciales chinas tradicionales y modernas, e inducen a sus alumnos al verdadero espiritu de las artes chinas.    SALUDOS Y GRACIAS NUEVAMENTE .
AA10269684	This article answers your question. It doesn't matter how much weight you must gain.    Characteristics of a Wide Receiver  There are many athletes who have the ability to run fast in a straight line, but to be a top wide receiver, the athlete must have the one quality that cannot be coached: quickness. He also must be able to change direction without losing any speed, run at full speed the minute he comes off the line of scrimmage, and continue to run flat-out throughout his entire pass pattern. You can almost always pick out a receiver who has great speed by his average yards-per-catch figure for the season.     However, if a player has a desire to be a wide receiver and he does not have tremendous speed, he should not automatically give up on his dream. With a great deal of hard work and dedication, there can be an opportunity for him to make the team at the receiver position. Even though all coaches would like to have receivers with great speed and quickness, there is a place for the receiver who, lacking speed, makes up for it with precise pattern execution, complete focus on the ball when it is thrown his way, and the ability to get away from defensive players or to find the hole between zone coverages.     Along with a thorough grasp of offenses and defenses, another important trait found in any successful wide receiver is concentration. First, he must concentrate on getting off the ball on the snap count. As he releases off the line of scrimmage, the receiver must concentrate to recognize the defense that is being used. While still running at full speed, he must concentrate on running the pattern called in the offensive huddle, running it in the exact manner that will allow him to be in the best position to defeat the coverage being executed by the defense. Finally, as he moves into the final phase of his pass pattern, the wide receiver must be able to shut everything out of his mind, focusing his eyes and all of his attention on the ball as it moves toward him. He must be consumed with total and complete concentration on making the catch.     This ability to focus on the catch and the understanding of the importance of the catch are demonstrated by great wide receivers every time they walk on the field to practice or play football. They know that if they practice with intensity and dedication, attempting to catch any pass that they can touch, their performance in a game will become automatic.     Conditioning, the ability to run on play after play without slowing down, is also a vital characteristic of any great receiver. All football players should be ready to run when practice begins, but the very nature of the job of a wide receiver requires that they come to the practice field in the very best physical condition. Fatigue and a lack of conditioning will turn a good receiver into an average pass catcher faster than anything else that might happen to him during practice or a game.     Playing as a wide receiver on a football team can be exciting for any young player, but he must understand that it is not an easy position to play. He will be required to run continuously during the entire practice session or game when he is on the field. Prospective wide receivers also must realize that while they may not be required to block like an offensive lineman or even a tight end, they will be involved in contact. They should be prepared for this, and especially to "take a hit" after a catch, accepting this inevitable collision as a part of playing the game as a wide receiver.|`|TSEqHvS4aa	someone said "do not lift, it'll stunt your growth", bullshit. i started lifting at the age of 12, i'm 31 years old now, 5'11", 215lb japanese guy. yeah, maybe i would be like 6'5" or taller if i didn't lift. anyways, practice should be starting soon (or has already). ask your coach what you need to do. he'll give you hands on experience and can teach you more than you can read here on yahoo! answers. best tip for a receiver, catch the ball.|`|MRLt9i3naa	do NOT LIFT. it'll stunt your growth. eat right and run and jsut play football. your 12....you got a long ways to go. trust me on this DO NOT LIFT YOU'LL BE A MIDGET.|`|PuUjphHraa	Look up LT's Work out he does some odd looking but effective drills.

Si lo haces, y levantas mucho la patada, corres el riesgo de que tu rival "sepa" como bloquearte y no slo eso, tirarte al piso y sacar tu fmur de su posicin en la cadera, lo cual es harto doloroso y te dejar fuera de combate. O bien, tambin pods encontrarte con un muro de ki (energa) de tu rival, el cual te tomar y te lanzar al piso de espaldas. Una vez que ests en el suelo as de golpeado, el que te pateen la cabeza o algo peor, es slo cuestin de tiempo, como sabrs.    Es de especial importancia, a menos que se est en una pelcula de Hollywood :), mantener los pies bien agarrados al piso para mantener el equilibrio y potenciar la defensa o el ataque. Esto es bsico. Slo en las pelculas, o si peleas ficticiamente (en la prctica de artes marciales) o contra ni?os :), a alguien se le ocurrira dar patadas altas. En un combate callejero es muy peligroso alejarse tanto del piso.    Por eso lo mejor es "evitar el combate callejero" siempre que se pueda, salvo que a uno lo acorralen y no tenga otra salida. Y si a uno lo acorralan entre varios, la mejor posicin es estar contra una pared, para tener la espalda cubierta y no recibir golpes desde all. Si te hacen caer al suelo, ests casi perdido, as que hay que mantener el equilibrio lo ms posible. De hecho, huir ante la menor oportunidad, al zafar del acorralamiento, es la mejor medida a tomar an si eres Bruce Lee en persona. Uno nunca sabe lo que traen los otros en los bolsillos ni tampoco su habilidad en combate.    Si persistes en buscar pelear en la calle, puede que te cruces con alguien que sepa ms que t sobre peleas y te dejar lisiado o muerto incluso. Tambin estn las armas de fuego, recuerda. Cuidado aqu, jovencito, porque el que vive por la espada, muere por la espada, como dijo alguien hace mucho tiempo.|`|QbBjsy8Qaa	das lastima...|`|jWywnF7faa	hoy en dia existen sicologos muy buenos para tratar estos temas que sin duda alguna en una enfermedad muy grabe|`|hF3c1UoHaa	pues depende, si quieren matarme o hacerme da?o realmente, lo mas seguro es que si.

Prq1R8S4aa	first of all you need to make sure that your pectorial(chest)muscles and your back muscles are balanced.  Your back muscles prople your legs so they are very important.  One way to figure out whether or not they are balence is to lay down on the ground with your hands directly behind your headand elbows out.  the side of your arms that is closest to the ground should touch the ground.  if they dont then you need to work on your back muscles more.   Another thing is to work on your thighs and hip reflexors.  for experience play some flag or touch football to work on your elusiveness.  For speed jump some rope for ten minutes straight then rest for no more than two minutes and jump rope agian for another five.

rseD4OG2aa	I know that he has indeed signed a deal with WWE. I think that the original plan for his re-entry was to have him be the one to interfere in the Jeff Hardy-Edge match at the Royal Rumble. However, it's well known that Vince and WWE management pay a ton of attention to the internet wrestling forums and chat stuff, so when everyone kind of figured out that Christian was coming back he most likely held it off.  I agree though, the Christian hype was getting a little big. I really like Christian and he is a fantastic wrestler, but I think that most people thought it would be this HUGE storyline and that's why they pulled it from the Royal Rumble. It would have been too obvious. Vince likes to be as unpredictable as possible, even when it results in a negative decision and he's got a long history of making major storyline changes on the fly.|`|QQyWUDI8aa	WELL IF HE IS NOT IN THE WWE BY WM25 HE IS NOT COMING BACK TO THE WWE|`|3G2kI3Vqaa	AS of today 02/05/09 he has NOT signed a contract.|`|uiRkBwa9aa	hey ima good story writer and i could think of stuff that no1 else will. 15 but the WWE shoulld employ me in 5-7 years cause they got big show hugging vickie from me!!!!!!!!!!!|`|VlsaWHebaa	It was never actually confirmed that he signed the contract. He left TNA, WWE send him papers for him to sign so he can be on Smackdown and be part of the whole Jeff feud but it never happened. I'm sick of all the rumors too, people these days go way over board with their predictions.|`|4yDBsSv4aa	Hope he comes.|`|kDAmNqt0aa	Yes he has signed they are just waiting for the right time to bring him in, the thing is the crestive team are crap nowadays and should all get sacked, they are so predictable in there storylines. But yes he is on his way back and lets hope he gets a big push because he;s proved that he's much more than a mid carder which they thought of him before.|`|9bry2rXyaa	he is supposed to make a comeback soon,yes.he agreed to the WWE deal,and now it's just a matter of time before he makes his return.|`|NYuoB1IQaa	Christian has not appeared on WWE television because he is not signed and the original deal between him and the company broke down. One source told WrestlingNewsWorld.com earlier this evening that Christian agreed in principle to a deal with a downside guarantee worth $150,000 per year. Right before the deal was signed, WWE lowballed the offer to a $75,000 downside guarantee and Christian backed out.    As of this writing, WWE and Christian are still negotiating but the last offer on the table was the $75,000 downside. Due to the contract not being signed, Christian is currently not included in any creative plans for WrestleMania 25. Obviously if a deal is reached, creative will resume plans for his return.
xNsJqTgaaa	try creating little suspendors for it, kind of like a bra strap.  if you just want it tighter, a safety pin will do the trick.    Or you can secure it in place by safety pinning it through your shirt|`|MfxHpLVWaa	Duck Tape haha|`|kDshEkXraa	On the inside of the strap I would put a line of rubber cement, let it harden but when it does it stays rubbery and sticks to your skin more.  If that doesn't work gain some weight and your gut should keep it in place.
tpZwcYLQaa	My friend wants to be in the olympics, and hes doing track, and he tells me form is always important.    as for training do mild-intense workout of your legs. if you go to a school that has a fitness centre with weights etc, use those if u can. Like my school has somthing called "fitness club" and you can do w/e u want.    if u don have those, do stutter steps as fast as you can on one spot, do squat jumps, do lunges, jump rope. do this every day for about 1-1.5 weeks, 30 minutes (find the time that best fits your daily schedule) and keep doing that.     after 1-1.5 weeks, rest up, eat, stretch out the major muscles, and test out your mile run, the 4 mile run. see if u've improved. improving by 5 seconds is even good. improve your time with small increments. cut off 5 at first then 10, 15, and so on.    after that if ur not satisfied, go back to ur leg training, rest up eat.... u get the idea, repeat until u've seen a big change.    Remember this may not take about a month, it cud even take up to 3-5 months. My friend whos on the track team, trains like a pro and yet he still gets around 5:40 seconds on a mile run|`|l1p5M0Q8aa	just run and time yourself, everytime it hurts dont stop until you cant move no more.  i am in the same position as you.
xGLyp2TOaa	All of your Major Brands of shoes (Nike, Reebok, Adidas, Asics, New Balance, Puma, ect) Have running shoes... to find the best price your going to need to shop around a bit.

The Steelers lost longsnapper Justin Hartwig and punter Daniel Sepulveda and countless other key players, but we didn't let that slow us down. If you're going to be a threat in the playoffs, you can't make excuses on why you didn't make it last year.|`|598ef79a48401775d80cde19c2c14471aa	I wouldn't be surprised.  the Cardinals made the Super Bowl.  What were they last year?  The Giants won the year before.  By the way things are going it could be the Lions and Raiders next year.  Well, maybe not the Raiders or Jags.  The AFC is actually pretty consistent.|`|MbcvI1A9aa	defiantly. i thought they had a SB run this year,but like u said the injuries really affected them.|`|B8sJEBxTaa	No, they won't make the postseason.|`|I2wqc5rBaa	The Jaguars have to have a good draft, and must come out of the divison first (Colts, Titans, and Texans)

Haha Rivers is the better QB. You said the Broncos O line sucked? That was the Chargers O line not the Broncos.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	as a person, Cutler.  As a QB, Cutler.  You cant argue with Rivers numbers this past year though. He was a machine.|`|qq1fSV2daa	rivers hands down .. anyone who says otherwise obviously didnt watch football this season .. cutler has better receivers and rivers still puts up better numbers and is a much better leader .. cutler looks like he doesnt even care out there .. at least rivers shows some emotion .. who cares if they are nice or not off the field.. this is football damnit !|`|aOx2hovgaa	cutler|`|gfB5VNXTaa	Cutler by far.  He is doing so much with so little and he was the offense last year.  Cutler is turning his recievers into stars.  He is a better person, too and has a lot more class.|`|d0c38f1aaab70e366c43164878682f34aa	Jay Cutler    He has  1 character,  1 talent, and is top 5 QB    Philip Rivers is  1 at something, though.  He's  1 overrated douchebag|`|yqC51KXOaa	easily rivers. he turned one of the positions mainly used for blocking into his main receiver with antonio gates. plus rivers did it on a run heavy team while jay cutler plays on a passing team.|`|oHJ0ZEFqaa	Um a toss up with this one. As a person, Rivers is an ****** sometimes and acts like so on the field when he is shooting is mouth off. As a qb, he is very good and uses that fire he has to carry and drive a team down the field. As a person, Cutler is pretty arrogant as well and talks some big game even though... he hasn't won much of anything. As a qb, he has a great arm and we've all seen some great throws by him.     I actually like Rivers in this situation as a player because I am a fan of his fiery drive and there is no doubt that he is the leader of that offense. Even though I think Cutler has the better physical tools to with the game, including weapons around him, I haven't seen enough from him to give him any more credit than he is already getting. They are both young so its not a final decision or definite that one is better than the other. But I've seen Rivers in the Playoffs, haven't seen Cutler.|`|op4fEbEVaa	Rivers is way better|`|2oozKS3taa	the question isn't who is better, its who you like more.  I like cutler because Rivers is a jerk.|`|Z4RW26pZaa	Hmm, well, Cutler does looks like a baby, and acts like one too, he talks trash, yet hasn't been to the playoffs, he hasn't accomplished anything. don't know why the hell he's in the probowl     Rivers all the way, Why even ask such a question
nqdDe3cJaa	i pay no attention to anybody who claims one conference is the best year after year.  they clearly dont know a damned thing about college football and are only sharing their homer opinions.  i tend to not get into debates with uneducated people.  its a waste of time.    seriously .... rating college football players before they ever play a single down in college football ..... seems pretty stupid to me.  if it was that easy there would never be cases like Ryan Leaf being drafted  2 overall or Joe Montana getting drafted 82nd overall.      i said i dont get into debates .... i never said i dont let people know what morons they are.    Zinger - overall, the SEC is certainly one of the better conferences in college football and they are most certainly the best from time to time .... but they are nowhere near as dominant as some people make them out to be.  of the 6 major conferences in the past 20 years, the SEC has the worst out of conference record of any conference when both teams are ranked.  SEC teams get fat off weak non conference schedules and dont do so hot when they play tough teams from other conferences.  but that convo is for another time.  in my opinion though .... the SEC was the best conference LAST year.  next year .... we will have to wait and see.  i just dont like homers .... period.  i went to Washington, so i love Pac 10 football .... but ill crack on Pac 10 homers just as quickly as ill crack on SEC homers.  like the morons who claimed the Pac was the best last year because they went 5-0 in the bowl games.  lol ... please.  what the 5-0 in bowl games did was restore some of the respect the Pac lost during the season after some VERY bad out of conference losses.  the Pac 10 simply will not be the best conference in any given year until UCLA and Washington return to form.  they are historically 2 of the 3 best teams in the conference and the Pac needs them back if they want to be in the best conference conversation.    as for Felicia and the Fraud 12 .... lol ....... the entire country saw what frauds they were in December and January.        lol @ im a USC fan.  i wish.  Trojans .... Dawgmeat.  Huskies .... Dawgmeat.  which makes more sense.  hmmmm.  we did just steal USCs offensive and defensive coordinators however (Sarkisian - head coach, Holt - DC) .... maybe thats what the Texas homer was referring to.  i went to WASHINGTON slick, i cant stand USC.|`|2bGR2WDmaa	good for the SEC, just because you get the talent, doesn't mean that you know how to coach it    Ohio State finished in the top 5...I honestly could care less what any other Big 10 did as far as recruiting...because I want to beat those teams...am I wrong!??!?!|`|OFi3jBSHaa	It's because the SEC has the highest graduation rate.|`|LVjM9k8yaa	Texas finished with a good class, that's all I really care about. More importantly they finished with a better class then nOU. As far as the rest of the Big 12, I couldn't care less. For those who think ranking incoming classes before they ever step on campus is a waste of time, a lot of money gets spent doing it every year so someone must think it's worthwhile.    Don't pay much attention to Dawgmeat, he's a bitter USC fan who thinks everyone is a moron if they don't agree with him. Especially anyone who favors a SEC or Big 12 school. I'm thinking it's just jealousy. Go Pac 1!    45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!!    Oh good, Washington. Not even the good part of the Pac 1. I see your new coach doesn't fall too far from his mentor. Already had his hands slapped for a couple of recruiting no-no's.
AA10297143	You didn't hear about it because it didn't happen.  The "Boss" played.  I love Journey also, and would have known about it if they made a spot appearance.  If you watched, you didn't see them play either.  Someone has played a YouTube hoax.  They did play in a "pre-game" show, however, which is why it didn't get as much publicity.    The band sang Dont Stop Believing during the pre-game show. In case youre wondering where the hell is Steve Perry well, hes not part of the group anymore.

It depends on how your built if you can carry that much more.  Other than that it depends on what you like to do more hitting or avoid being hit.  LB's get more in the NFL level, but honestly the chances are 1 in 50,000 at best.  Knowing by your question your not on a scholarship.|`|geih5vR8aa	Safety or Cornerback if you got speed, and can keep up with receivers. No one wants a LB with D-Line speed, and Cornerback strength... it should be the opposite of that.    Also, it never hurts to try out for the kicker, or punter, or the guy that holds the ball for kickers... lol... OR, try out for special teams.     Possession receiver may be a possibility too.  Gotta work hard though.    a 4.7 40 yard dash is slow though. I know a lotta QB's with better speed than that. Try and get down to the 4.5 range, and work on the cone drill too. Quickness is underrated in football.

I would hate letting go of Soriano,C.Lee,Hart,and J.Bay..But with Reyes,and Upton you won't have to worry about drafting speed,or  runs..You can concentrate solely on RBIs+HOMERS..    ~g0()d LuCk!~|`|xQFWjFyZaa	Reyes for sure. He's the only player really worthy of a 1st round pick. Unfortunately,you're probably right about Hughes being the only one who qualifies.     Oswalt is the most valuable pitcher. I hope for your sake he starts off better this season than he did last.     If that is BJ Upton, then I would go with him. If not, Soriano or Markakis would be good choices.|`|c459712486b2360025bdedafecc9c3d9aa	I dont know about a phenom pick but you gotta hold onto Alfanso Soriono then I like Bay over Reyes, depends on if you like steals over the other offensive categories. Your pitchers pretty much suck but as long as Oswalt is healthy going into spring training, I would think he would be solid.|`|UoT86gbiaa	Well, Hughes is it for the prospect then.  Reyes is a no-brainer.  Oswalt is your best pitcher.  For your last pick, Upton is probably the popular choice, though with Reyes's steals he largely duplicates what you already have.  Soriano can still produce at an elite level, though he's aging and an injury risk.  I'm something of a Corey Hart fetishist myself, despite the way he rolled over and died at the end of last year.  Markakis certainly won't let you down.  Any of those OFs would be fair for you to choose from.
qq1fSV2daa	well 1st of all phelps is facing possible criminal charges which ricky williams did not .. and 2nd because in the NFL, marijuana is a banned substance .. swimming doesnt really have a season or a league so unless he was in the middle of a competition and got caught it wouldnt effect him in that way.. and the media loves when athletes get in trouble with the law .. they eat it up like chocolate cake.. but in my personal opinion pot is not bad enough where it should be illegal .. and the government could profit a **** load if they legalized it and mass produced it but thats just my thought|`|ZqrIDrAraa	Phelps is an American hero, he basically won the medal count for America over China. They would never put someone like that in jail. Also, he is much more popular than Williams.   Just like they did with Paris Hilton, famous people with money always get out of trouble|`|e4ekb1amaa	It's apples to oranges.    Phelps passed all his drug tests while he was competing in the Olympics. Ricky Williams was an active player in the NFL, who failed drug tests at least 3 times. Because of this he faced a suspension (NOT expulsion) from the league. He then left the league to play in Canada, and he has since returned....    Phelps on the other hand could face criminal charges, which Williams did not, and he may also miss out on millions in endorsement deals as companies have the right to withdraw them because this damages his image and therefore the image of the company. With the current economy, many companies may jump at the chance as they're looking to save money. Williams on the other hand had very few (if any) endorsements. He really never had many at all - he was always aloof and seemed to be afraid of exposure.    Which punishment would you rather have? A suspension, followed by doing whatever you want with your already made millions of dollars after you were given 2 chances to stop smoking pot, followed by getting rehired at your former position, where you now still make a ridiculous amount of money? Or criminal charges where you may lose millions of dollars in endorsements and have no opportunity other than endorsements to make money....      seems like Ricky got the better end of the deal here...|`|OURb1rnTaa	apparently it's not okay for either. phelps is now losing endorsement deals and being investigated.|`|cdQryr7paa	Because Phelps is a swimmer.  There is no National Swimmer's League.  Don't worry, even though Phelps probably won't get charged with any criminal charges, his income from doing commercials is about to drop drastically.  He was making big dollars doing all kinds of commercials, so I expect his endorsment clients to start dropping him really fast.  Too many cameras in the world.|`|AA11830687	I agree and this is not Phelps 1st time getting in trouble. He got arrested on a DUI a few years ago and nothing happened. I hope they take all his medals from him!!!! There is a double standard!!!!|`|OFi3jBSHaa	It's because this is a racist society.  What are you talking about? He did get suspended from competition.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Because Williams did it several times and chose not to quit. As for Phelps, he was just smoking something from a pot and like the second answerer said he could've lied and said it was tabacco or something. But instead he admitted that it was pot, people love honesty, c'mon..|`|u7GBP579aa	I am not racist or anything but it is the way Society is, a black man does something bad and they kick him out the league and throw him in jail. A white man does it and he is okay|`|KEk728Gsaa	Ricky Willams tested positive for marijuana 3 times, and chose to retire.    Michael Phelps admitted to doing it (he could've easily said he was only smoking tabacco or huka in the picture), and he stopped smoking weed before his professional career.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	I hear you, i agree.  It does appear to be a double standard of some type.|`|iE2sDxDAaa	Phelps was not "caught" smoking dope. There was a picture of him putting a bong towards his mouth. Was there dope in it? IDK... can't tell by a picture.    Ricky was arrested (if I remember correctly), tested 100% positive, and fined.     Either way, idk why anyone makes a big deal about it.|`|weFIFnVKaa	michael phelps is a better athlete than rick Williams and i think ricky williams an imature person and phelps is a mature person he even admitted it... he said it was fun but he made a mistake... ricky williams did alot of worst things to himself
GERlmBIUaa	i believe since its a big game its either gonna be on TNT.com or if not that than for sure its gonna be on ESPN360.com|`|13XU8cCKaa	Why don't you watch it on TNT.  It is being nationally telivised so you shiuld be able to watch it on TV.  But Justin.tv is the only website I know.
