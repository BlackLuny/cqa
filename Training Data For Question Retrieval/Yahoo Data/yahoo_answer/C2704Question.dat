20081112030539AAoXh9G	Pets;Dogs	Would a French Bulldog and a Pug get along well together?	I live in a 2bed/1bath house. It has a nice sized backyard that is fenced in where the dogs could run and play. I'm used to having a couple little dogs running around, they were two Chihuahuas, but I wanted a change in breeds. Whatever the breed is has to be smooth coated and besides my niece who visits maybe three times a year it'll be just me with them. they just have to get along with children. Would these choices be good?  
20081103172429AAbKIzM	Pets;Dogs	Frenchies...how to house break?	Hi, I'm thinking of getting a French Bulldog & I'm curious...about how long (on average) do they take to house break? Is crate training/rewarding the best method, and what age can I start expecting a Frenchie to begin growing out of puppyhood? I have a 6 & 2 yr old, so I don't want to get a dog that's too young.           Thank you for your answers & do tell your experiences with this breed...if you have any!! ;)
20081118063329AA1geUX	Pets;Cats	Cat lovers/owners: Am I right to feel that my Mom shouldn't euthanize the family cat for the following reason?	Our family has had this cat since I was in 7th grade (11 years ago), and I rescued her from the woods behind my school.    The cat has a problem with hairballs/throwing up her food, so my mom has been giving her oral medication that seems to help immensely with the problem. Unfortunately, the cat doesn't like having liquid squirted down her throat, and yesterday she but my mom on the had hard enough to draw blood.    My mom has a heart problem that makes it even more dangerous than normal for her to get an infection, so I understand that she can't keep the cat.  When I offered to find a home for the cat, she refused and told me that she was going to euthanize after the ten-day waiting period is up.    I understand that animals who have extreme behavioral problems need to be euthanized for reasons of safety, so don't think I'm totally against it in all circumstances. Honestly, my mom has been suffering from depression for the past few months since she had to euthanize her dog for health reasons.  She always tries to grab the cat and hug her, and my mom gets upset when the cat resists.  When I was visiting my parents two days ago, I even saw my mom pull the cat's tail and rub her fur the wrong way.  This is the woman who taught me to treat animals with respect, so I'm at a loss.    So, here's the question: my mom is resisting allowing me to find a home for the cat, even if the home has no children in it. (I can't take her because the apartment complex I live in with my husband won't allow it.  Also, I'm pregnant, and my husband won't be able to help clean the litter box because he's going to be gone for ten weeks in the Marines.)    Am I totally out of line in thinking that she's doing the wrong thing by insisting on killing the cat instead of giving it to a good home?  This situation is very upsetting to me, as my mom seems to think that I don't care about her as much as the cat...    ** TEN POINTS FOR BEST ANSWER   *** No answers from people who like to shoot cats on sight. Thanks!

20090227051728AAqk9sK	Pets;Reptiles	Are there any 'signs' when a female king snake is ready to breed? My snake is acting 'strange'....read on?	My girl is about 10 years old, never seen another snake since birth...      She is acting very strange this last month or so... ie climbing up the top of her Viv (which is pretty high) and falling down... (in the past she would make her own way down)...just generally more energetic than usual, she is non stop night and day.      She isn't too warm as when she does stop for a 5 or 10min break, it is always on the heat.       Even after eating she is the same where as before she would 'take it easy' for a day or two!

I've always had this complex about hamster balls... everyone says how much they love them but i personally think the only reason they move in them, is cos they are trying to get out of it. when they try to climb up the side, it rolls!

I was told by a friend of their's that he was a pure bred black lab that they had bought by for their 2 month old pemature son when he finally left the hospital.  They were several months behind on their rent and when they moved they just left the puppy locked in a hot trailer in the middle of July.  The family was not a very functional one so it would not suprize me that they would leave a dog, pure bred or not, behind to fend for itself.  DFS was always at their home regarding neglet of the kids.  Several of my friend want to bred their labs with him now that he is close to 1 year old.  I would like to find out if he is indeed pure bred or not so I can tell them what to expect.  Is there a DNA test or something I can have done or am I up the creek without a paddle?

Ciao a tutti sono disperata, la mia gatta è in calore, siamo già al 2 tra poco gli dovrà venire il 3 calore, mi hanno detto che  se non la faccio accoppiare o non la sterilizzo entro il 3 calore impazzisce, gli viene il puss, insomma sta male, e potrebbe anche morire! sono preocupatissima, volevo chiedervi se è vera questa storia.   grazie

20070301120113AAcqk36	Pets;Cats	La mia gatta soffia al mio gattino?	il mio gattino è stato appena castrato (non avrei voluto ma non può uscire perchè abitiamo vicino ad un viale frequentato da moltissime macchine e non me la sento di farlo uscire) e la mia gatta ha un comportamento strano: appena lui le si avvicina per giocare o solo per starle vicino lei si innervosisce, soffia e scappa via spaventata come se avesse visto un fantasma. non solo: basta che il piccolo entri nella stanza dove lei è seduta su una sedia e inizia subito a soffiare. secondo voi dipende dal fatto che oggi l'ho sterilizzato e magari ha un odore che non le piace o le fa paura (quello del veterinario)?

I feed my dog his regular dog food (medical for puppies) and I've been adding chicken broth or pieces of boiled meat to his meal at night- I feed him dry food alone in the morning and at night I feed him dry food with one of the extra's. I also give him a tablespoon of olive oil once a week to keep his fur shiney. I don't add anything like salt or butter to his food. I keep it all natural and healthy.    Is this bad for him?    I want to feed him home cooked food but my vet told me it wouldn't be as healthy as the medical because the dry food contains all the nutrients my dog needs. Does anyone know of any good dog nutrition web sites or books?   Thanx

20090227055834AAlgpHk	Pets;Dogs	Kennelled dogs, some input please :)?	I have a very small house. Not only that but I have 3 children under 10 in my very small house. My dog is getting on (12 yrs old) and obviously I have started to think about what I will do when she goes on.   I love having dogs but to be honest even my well behaved border collie is causing problems in such a small house re: mud and hair etc.   So me and my husband discussed it and came to the conclusion that when we get another dog we would have to kennel him/her.   In doing so we could offer 2 long term rescue centre dogs a home as it wouldn't;t matter about house breaking and they wouldn't be alarmed by the noise of the kids.   How does this Sound to you guys??   They would have a insulated (lamp heated in winter) kennel area (large enough for raised beds and good floorspace. A large run @ 24' x24' maybe. We live on a 10 acre croft so there is ample fenced exercise on site as well as country walks. I am at home all day and often on the yard (with the horses etc) so in addition to walks they would also get to be outside the run with me in the day.   Do you think a rescue centre would be glad of a home like this to 2 long term residents??   Many thanks for your time and advice in advance :)   x

20070723100812AAekFJc	Pets;Cats	Gatto con il mio stile di vita?	Il mio stile di vita mi fa viaggiare moltissimo, non per periodi brevi ma solitamente a lungo termine. Per esempio quest'anno ho gia vissuto in due continenti diversi, e a Settembre andro' a vivere in un terzo, cioe' a Roma, a casa mia. Ora che mi sto per trasferire con l'intenzione di stare ferma per almeno un anno, vorrei farmi un gatto ma molte persone mi dicono di non farlo, perche' sicuramente mi trasferiro' di nuovo nei prossimi anni e non e' giusto spostare un gatto avanti e indietro in citta' paesi e case nuove.    Io invece sono dell'idea che se lo prendo piccolo, di poche settimane o mesi, e fin da piccolo lo abituo a viaggiare e conoscere nuovi ambienti, non sara' troppo stressante. Voi che ne dite?      Ovviamente mi prenderei tantissima cura di lui e farei tutto il possibile per non creargli problemi.

20090227055649AAjgfLk	Pets;Dogs	Buying two dogs at once?	I have decided to finally buy two dogs (I wanted to make sure that I was financially stable before purchasing). However, the two types of dogs are drastically different. I want an Alaskan Malamute and a Chow. Malamute’s are intelligent, need a lot of exercise, and very friendly towards humans. And though Chows are also very smart and loyal, they are VERY much guard dogs and territorial. So I thought it would be best to get the two dogs at the same time, this way they can grow up with each other. Because I do not want to end up having the Chow be aggressive towards the Malamute. Do you think this is the right way to go about it?      (And as far as obedience trainings, I have had a lot of experience, so I will still be able to train both of them at once)      Any other tips? Thank you!

20090227053837AApV9fJ	Pets;Dogs	Need help with Problem Puppy!?	My 7 month old Akita has been nothing but a problem from day one. We got her at 4 months from a family who didn't think much of training her and didn't feed her properly.       More recently she's started to get really aggressive. A few nights ago my husband pushed her away from him because he was eating and she nipped at him and started showing her teeth. But that's the only time she's been like that with him. I'm home all day with her and I take her out 1-2 times depending upon the weather and how good I feel as my health is pretty bad right now.       About a week ago I told her no for doing something I think it involved trying to get into the trash and she ignored me so I got up and tried to push her away and once I came near her she immediately started showing her teeth and trying to nip at me. So I grabbed her leash wrapped it around her neck and forced her into the bathroom and left her there until my husband came home.       Then today I took her out it all went okay ... She did her business and everything. Well for some reason she decided to poop right in the middle of my living room. It was too late to stop her so I told her no bad girl calmly and I was going to grab her and put her on her pee-pad where she KNOWS she's suppose to go. Instead she immediately starts showing her teeth and growling at me. At this point I tell her loudly and sternly "No" and to get out of the room. So after awhile of her trying to stare me down she runs into the hallway and pees all over the floor of course about 5inches from her pee pad.       I'm more concerned about the showing of teeth than anything. I've never been mean to her. I lavish her with affection but both my and I are dominant with her. But this new behaviour scares me. She's a big dog and what if she tries to bite?

20070927021102AAKqaaf	Pets;Dogs	I have a 12 and a half year old golden retriever with bad arthritis.?	Its his two back legs that are giving him the most trouble. He is my parents dog really since I moved out of home 2 years ago, but I grew up with him as a child. As the winter sets in and it gets colder my parents wont allow him to stay in the house, so he sleeps outside in the freezing cold. It breaks my heart to see him shivering in the cold. He has a kennel (with no blanket) but he doesnt use it. I have given out to them and asked them nicely to let him stay indoors but they never listen to me.   I was thinking of putting a hot water bottle in the kennel with a blanket and heating the hot water bottle up every night, what do you think, is there anything else I can do for him?   P.S. I cannot take him home with me as after all he is their dog and I wouldnt have the space for him, and I wouldnt want to move him from the only home he has known his entire life.   Any tips or advice would help, Im really looking for home-made tips and advice, like if there is any food I can give him 4 the pain

Der christlichen Theologie kommt das 'Verdienst' zu, den Menschen aufgrund seiner Unsterblichkeit enorm aufgewertet zu haben. Dadurch wurden jedoch die übrige Sch?pfung und sogar die Tiere so abgewertet, da? jede Ausbeutung und Grausamkeit ihnen gegenüber m?glich und rechtens werden konnte.   Luise Rinser schrieb dazu: Wenn wir die Schreie der vom Menschen gequ?lten Tiere h?ren müssten, wir ertrügen es nicht. Wir verstopfen unsere Ohren.

I've tried wetting her kibbles and I've use a food processor to really grind them.  I do give her nutrical, which I have to force into her water-downed with a dropper.  She is so hungry and just seems to be flipping her kibbles because she can't chew them.  I've tried canned food and cooked chop meat.  Right now I pry open her mouth and force feed her.  She's a little thing.. She only weighs 2.3 pounds..  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks..

Hello i recently got two hermit crabs they are in a 10 gallon with a cage attached to top for climing the substrate in the bottom of my tank is about 5 inches of sand i keep it sand castle consistency and i feed them freshfood every evening and salt water and fresh are both in my tank for them. I do not have a heat source or light just yet and i was wondering could this be the problem. I have an "upstairs" level in the tank in the cage part with a reptile climbing stick and plants for them to get up on to get to the second level one has gotten up there yesterday and today and burried himself in the mulch or woodchips i have up there i know they molt and stuff but hes not in the deep sand and he still has his shell on why could this be? could it be that he is trying to keep warm im 15 and involved witha  lot of sports and havent had the chance to get him a light i only had them for 3 days, and i use my turtles heat light to give them some heat for a lil while each day. but i will get a heat source very shortly. But for now my room is very warm and the warmest room in the house always at 25 degress celsius. also i keep the tank humidified with a hermit crab spray bottle i bought at the pet store. the hiding hermit crab has had the ends of two of his legs cut off maybe fighting or summin else before i got him.

20090227060307AAPtKUc	Pets;Dogs	How much food should I feed my dog?	I have a 5 month old rat terrier..female. When I first got her I was feeding her Cesar gourmet dog food with Iams dry food. She ate it really well. Well Audrey got sick cuz I gave her some steak and I had to take to the vet, not my regular vet. But this vet proceeded to ask me what I fed her. When I told him Cesar he freaked out, and recommended Science Diet. After doing some research I found out that Science Diet isn't the best food. So I have Audrey on Dick Van Pattens Natural Balance Eatables. This is soft food that has like peas, carrots, dumplings, pasta and "REAL" pieces of chicken in it. I buy the 5 ounce cans. Audrey eats three 5 ounce cans a day. The Cesar came in 3.5 ounces and she really didn't eat it like she does this food. I feed her 3 times a day. She weighs 5.5 pounds. The feeding guide on the can says 1-5pounds 1/2-3 cans. Is 3 cans okay?  She's on a schedule..she eats every 5 hours. I bought the hard food to soften it up, but she REFUSES to eat it. She is so used to eating Iams hard food. she is still losing teeth. Any suggestions? Also my dog got her rabies vaccine on Valentines Day. Now she has a knot below her neck. Is this normal? and will it go away?      Let me know guys

We have not got her fixed yet since she has been an indoor cat and she has never done the dread "yowl" I remember well from my cat growing up. Well now we live in a townhouse and she has been pushing her way outside. It is time to get her fixed. But what I would like to know, she has never shown any signs of being in heat. She is also very anti social and doesn't like people. Could she just not be going through heat or just shy away for us not to notice because of her social anxiety. Also, can a cat spontaneously go into heat when outside or is it in a cycle?
20070809084208AAuLpUL	Pets;Dogs	My English bulldog Daisy has a red bumb on her eye does anyone know what it is?	Last weekend, at the cottage, I notice a red mark on Daisy's (my english bulldog)  eye. Now, it's in the back corner (not the corner towards her nose) of her right eye, smaller then a dime, a redish pinkish colour, and to me, it looks like it's a scratch that has swollen up. Now of course as soon as I saw it, I went to the vet. She did an ink test (to test if it was a scratch) and the whole red spot illuminate, meaning it's a scratch, right? But the problem is that the vet seemed unsure, which make me uneasy. I wanted to make sure that it would go away and it wouldn't make my baby go blind. The vet said she'd never sceen this before. She gave me a gel called: Tobrex.  My bulldog is like a baby to me, so I'm a little worried. Has anyone ever had something like this? A red bumb on the eye? Do you think it's a scratch that just got a little irratated because some cottage sand? We for sure know it's not a cherry eye. Does anyone know what it is? Does it sound like something you know?

When he brought the puppy in he was crying and shaking. He put my puppy in his bed and check him 15 mins later he was still shaking. So my boyfriend brought him into our bed and gave him to me. Since then my puppy has slept with us every night.    I take him out once in the middle of the night because he starts to wine. We have had little to no problems with him going to the bathroom inside the house.  When we go to work he still gets a treat and goes to his crate.

We socialized her as a puppy, but she would just hide under the chair during the puppy play sessions.  When a dog tries to play with her or just sniff her, she gets very afraid and cowers away and shows her teeth and growls.  This happens with big dogs, small dogs, puppies, any dog!  She has never played like a normal dog and doesn't seem to understand playing.  She gets along with cats just fine.  My sister got a new dog and they will be meeting this weekend.  Her new dog is very calm, so I think that will help my dog to be less afraid of him.  Are there any tips for making the introduction go smoothly?  Such as on leashes vs. off leashes.  If she is growling and showing her teeth, we normally separate the dogs, is this the right thing to do?  Any advice would be helpful...thanks!

20090304080810AAU4yQr	Pets;Cats	How long should I wait before taking my kittens too the vet?	I'm bringing my babies home in april. I believe I'm going to insure them, because it's easier for me to afford the 50 a month, than it is to afford any big bills suddenly.    After I bring them homw (they'll be 8 weeks) I'll need to take them to the vet for the rest of their shots. How long should I wait before taking them? Wait until their adjusted to their new home? Or right away?      And what sort of things should I be looking for when picking a vet?

Salve a tutti,   Mio fratello ha comprato una tartaruga di quelle che si mettono nella vaschetta con acqua dolce.E' molto piccola,misura circa 5 cm, e non so davvero come accudirla! Per esempio non so cosa mangi oltre quegli stupidi gambetti secchi che ormai non mangia da 2 giorni; oppure quanta acqua ci voglia nella vaschetta,se deve essere fredda o meno, o se deve stare al sole o in un posto chiuso e all'ombra!   Potete darmi qualche consiglio?!?! Grazie in anticipo!      PS: non è importante,ma c'è un modo per vedere se è maschio o femmina??? Grazie ancora.

20080826122102AAPaZCD	Pets;Dogs	What do you think about this breeder?	Hi Hannah!  I appreciate your questions and would not have it any other way.  After puppies are born, I start screening potential puppy buyers.  They come for a visit to see puppies.  My kids only go to the best homes.  There is a questionaire to fill in.     You can see by my web page, that I do all events with my dogs.  The last few years have benn devoted to my poodles(# 1 in Canada, one yesr and # 2 a couple years ( all breeds)  I am now working with my goldens(there is only so much time and money) I breed for dogs that can reach these high goals.  pretty, healthy dogs that can work and yet be a joy to live with.  The puppies are evaluated by me and place in the most suitable homes for what they would like in a dog. I show my dogs in conformation, agility, tracking, field, obedience and rally.    I have never had any health issues.  All dogs are acreedned for hips, health, eyes and heart, and come with 2 yr guarantee. All paper work goes with the puppy packet. They are sold as pets (unless a show prospect) on a spay/neuter contract.   The biggest draw back with the breed, is the shedding.   I belong to CKC and GRCA,             thats what she said to me also the dogs are 750 do you think shes okay?

She only has access to these "rare commodities" first thing in the morning since I wear socks all day.  I understand Beagles are very scent-driven and my feet, while not a pleasurable smell to most, are likely very pleasurable to my dog and the morning is the first time the dog sees me for the day, but I'm just wondering; is this normal?  She gets very excited and rolls around on my feet, sometimes pawing a little and sometimes licking.  I've been just trying to ignore it so far.  It is really funny, but first thing in the morning, every morning, it is pretty annoying.
20090304082244AASL5kT	Pets;Birds	Anyone know about Lovebirds breeding?? Thanks for the help!?	I have two Masked Lovebirds, one female, one male. I have been looking up about breeding them for about 2 years now. Both the birds are on a suitable breeding diet they have some seeds, lots of fruit and veg, cuttle fish, millet, egg shell, mashed hard boiled eggs and a vitamin block. They have a nest box attached to their cage and inside the nest box there is a small perch, a rubber mat (to stop splayed legs), some sawdust and some nesting material. On the bottom of the cage i also put some more nesting material for them to out in the box. The female bird spends most of her time in the nest box at the moment and usually only comes out to eat and some nights sleep next to her mate. They both groom each other all the time and when one of them goes somewhere the other one follows so they are definitely a bonded pair! As i said the female spends a lot of time in the box, but the male only goes up to it, he hasn't actually gone in yet! Is this normal? Thanks for your help!! I know its impossible to tell but i would like somebody to tell by the signs i have given on roughly how long it would be until she lays eggs? Also, she does take things into her nest box as i have found some random stuff in there! Like her feathers, seeds and bedding!

Hi I got a GSH puppy early in July and right now she is driving me crazy. i work from 9-5pm everyday and my bf works 2-11pm. She stays in her crate at night and I take her out in the morning and i put her back in crate before i go to work. If I don't keep her in crate she has accidents. I am starting to give up- I love her to death but I know I am not giving her enough time and attention as I should. I want better for her but it is so hard I am crying typing this message out. She has been starting to bite me playbite but it worries me because we keep her in the crate for more than 6 hours. I am torn to what i should do. I know if i put an ad in craigslist they will take her immidiately because she is a beautiful dog/majestic breed. I am not experienced with puppies and did not know it was going to be so difficult. I just feel guilty when I am not home and know deep in my heart she deserves much more. What do you think i am making a decision that I will regret later?

I work from 8-5, but I put him in the crate at 7, then I come home at 12 to let him out for 45mins, then I'm back home at 5 again to let him out.  Is this a good schedule for him because he hates it when I put him in the crate in the morning.  Also we went too bed last night at 930 and got up at 6am, but he had pottied in his crate.  How do I break him of this and how long can he hold his bladder?  Also I've only had him 4 days now, but he always wants attention and gets mad if he doesn't get any and it's really hard for me to do anything for my self, let alone cook a meal.  Will this change with time or will it be an ongoing thing?  Any insight would be appreciated!

When I take her to my parents' place, she gets along with their yellow lab and newfie but tends to overpower them and pursue dominance even though she's much younger. We tried to adopt a 5month old husky but in the meeting period, she wouldn't have another dog in the house. Will a puppy make a difference for her? When we got kittens, she took them on as her own and cares for them like she's their mother so I figured it might be the same with a puppy? I'm really not sure since I've never owned this breed of dog before. Any input would be great. Oh, and I'm looking toward dogs about her size. She's 11months and weighs around 55/60lbs   Thanks!

20090304074652AAywL2B	Pets;Dogs	Dog has oily coat - yes another oily dog question?	So I have a pit bull mix.  She is roughly over 1 year old.  She has a very thin coat, no undercoat.  So thin in fact you can see the black spots on her skin through her coat(she's white).  I try not to bathe her often but as she's white you can see she gets petted a lot.  Her coat is quite oily down the mid line of her back and through trial and error we've identified which foods to avoid with her.  No canned food, nothing with corn or fish(fish makes her very smelly).  So a good quality chicken or lamb and rice food.      What shampoo products would be recommended for her coat since it is so thin.  I only bathe her once a month unless we have extended periods of rain which magnify the smell.  She is crated while I work, so I wipe down the crate with a deodorizer/anti-bacterial several times a week.  Can't brush too often as her coat is soo thin her skin gets pretty angry even with a soft bristle brush.      Would the pet wipes help between washings or the dry shampoo be better?  Also, should I switch to a brush for people instead of pets, maybe one made from animal hair(boar bristle)?  It's not causing her hardship, but it sure does stink to us.      Thanks

He's only had the first shot a couple days ago and no difference in his comfort level yet.  When should I expect these injections to take effect?

20090304084613AATh7ox	Pets;Horses	Heard of homemade ointment recipe?	Someone at my stables gave a homemade ointment to another boarder for scratches and small wound care. I know there was Preparation H in the ointment along with 2 other things. However the boarder that knew what was in it has moved and we do not know what the recipe was.      The wound (a cut on a knee of a horse) responded great to the ointment after not responding well at all to a store bought ointment.      Does anyone know of an ointment recipe that includes Preparation H?

20090304084954AAN3VRB	Pets;Cats	Cat throws up after eating?	My Siamese mix throws up right after she eats about every other day or so.  I don't think it's hair because she does it so often and does it whether she's had hairball remedy or not.  Other than this she seems fat, healthy and acts normal.  We are going to the vet soon but I just wonder has anyone else had a similar problem?

20090304084448AAZrRhL	Pets;Cats	I have a 2 year old cat that wont stop pooping around the house... any suggestions on getting her to stop?	She is an orange tabby, 2 years old, and she seems to always go back to the same places to poop, and she has never done this before. It just started happening within the last month or so. She was pooing on a little piece of carpet that I had ontop of the wood floor, but yesterday I took the carpet and threw it away because she woun't stop pooping on it... but then last night she pooped in the same place but on the wood. I just dont know how much more I can take and want to fix the problem.

20090304090104AAP73Vq	Pets;Dogs	Dachshund whining constantly?	I have a male dachshund just over a year old. He has a very bad habit of whining. It is not just sometimes, it is ALL OF THE TIME.Most of the time he does it for no reason. He does it because he knows it pisses us off. In an elevator if he wants attention from another person and i pull his leash to prevent him from going to the person he will start whining, that is just one example. Sitting on the sofa he will just whine for no reason.   I am just wondering how i can go about  training him not to do this.

20090304090242AAK1hQ3	Pets;Dogs	Can my 5 yr old Whippet be in heat- again?	I adopted a 5 yr old Whippet last fall- she is not spayed. I had made an appointment in December for her to get spayed, but she went into heat. Her vulva got bigger and swollen looking, and I noticed some blood on her blanket. She licked herself all the time to clean it, so I didn't see any more messes. I'm having her spayed in a couple weeks- but I've noticed her vulva is big again. It isn't red, and doesn't seem to bother her, and she does lick, but not often. I haven't seen any blood. Is this normal? Could she be going into heat again?
20090304090545AA4xOqm	Pets;Dogs	My dog has kennel cough and gave it to the neighbors dog?	Hi, I have a 3 month old rottweiler mix and we brought him from the pound over 2 weeks ago. We rent a back house and the owner's have a 3 year old boxer in the backyard. Before we brought our dog, their dog wasn't sick. A few days later, my dog started with a cough and it sounded like he had kennel cough. I took her to the vet a week later because she got better in a few days. She gave her antibiotics and she is been taking them for 3 days now. The boxer also has that since  my dog gave it to her (we feel so bad about that). Her symptoms are worse than my dog, she is been puking white foam and all the food she eats, today it looked like her vomit had some blood on it. We are very worried, the neighbors are mad at us and are also giving her medicine but it's been 3 days already and it looks like she is not getting better. Is this how the medicine works? Is she supposed to be coughing even if she is taking the medicine? Because my dog is not coughing anymore. Also, my dog ate some of the boxer's puke, is this going to affect her more? I appreciate any answers. Thanks.

20090304090738AAJWB7o	Pets;Birds	Cranky Cockatiel? Is he tameable?	I bought my mother a pet cockatiel about a year ago, we call him cranky because he attempts to bite and hiss at almost everybody's hands. He hates hands, he has no problem sitting on shoulders and stepping up, we feed him and he has his cage open almost all day. The guy i bought it from said if we just kept petting him he would eventually tame down. This didn't happen, he seems to be a happy bird and whistles and chirps to us but just hates hands. Is there anything we can do or is this just his nature?

20090304091142AAI1mcN	Pets;Dogs	Great Pyrenees question?	I'm thinking of getting an adult male Great Pyrenees from a shelter, because A), I want a larger companion dog, B), I think he's beautiful, and C), I live in a cold climate (Maine). He wouldn't be made to stay outside, but it'd sure help for taking him on walks and whatnot.      Now, my predicament is, are Great Pyrs, as a general rule, aggressive? I have several neighbors who I am very good friends with, and they all have dogs as well, so an aggressive dog is out of the question. The one at the shelter seems very friendly, though. I've just never had a Pyr before, so I thought I'd ask you guys.      Thanks!
