I read some ridiculous crap on some other ESL forums that English teachers or white guys are able to have 6~10 fxxk buddies and date multiple Korean girls at same time if you're normal or below average looking foreinger      this must be total BS right?      I'm curious because I'm Korean and I haven't been to Korea for over 10 years... ...      PS - It's funny how some people wants their simple sex partnership to be recognized as "TRUE LOVE" type of thing by Asian males and calls racist to people who resent "sex partnership" YET ironically they cannot STAND WHITE WOMEN - ASIAN MEN couple loving each other... ... and often those guys have no respect for their Asian GFs

20090307055151AASaWGt	Travel;Asia Pacific;Japan	Three good cities in the Kanagawa Prefecture in Japan?	I write a little bit, and I like to be accurate. This part of the story calls for the Kanagawa Prefecture, most cities with a specific quality. (Please provide specific names for the cities, neighborhoods and such)      One city needs to be by the ocean with a middle-class neighborhood that has a decent view of the ocean. (Can be as far from the other two cities as need-be)      The next needs to be big on entertainment, including gimmick cafes. (Can be as far from the other two cities as need-be)      The last one doesn't need anything special-- I mainly need it as a go-between for the first two while being a decent place to live. (So it'd be good if it were somewhere in the middle of those two) I also need the name of a good place to eat in this city that serves a few vegetarian dishes and isn't too hard on the wallet.      Lastly, I'd need a rough estimate for how long it'd take to get between all of these places (From city 1 to 2 and such.) on both foot and train. (I'd look this much up myself, but Google Maps doesn't really like showing Japan locations in English.)      Here's hoping someone can actually answer this. :(
