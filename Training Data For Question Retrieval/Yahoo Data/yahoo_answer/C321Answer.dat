LSn5iF47aa	All the anime that has eng subs were made by subs teams so I don't think there's any video players that translate anime. :o|`|9kgCiU58aa	i'm not exactly sure what you mean. are you looking for a website where it has subbed videos? if you are then check out:<br>  animeseason.com<br>  or<br>  rawranime.com<br>  i like the first one better cuz it gives you a bunch of different viewers to watch the episodes in. hope this helps|`|xpowJMNTaa	they are so many sites, that i couldn't begin to list them all<br>  anime-media.com<br>  zomganime.com<br>  anilinks.com<br>   are some of the best, trust me >> watched over 322 series. <br>  If your looking for specific players they are a lot, like megavideo (but impose a time limit if you don't buy an account), veoh, ieem (spelling), chut-tai and others.

ztzEloj5aa	I am not clairvoyant or anything but from what i have seen where the father is white and mother black the child looks more white<br>  so he will probably be light skin-ed with a brown curly hair and light eyes|`|vH2OF9z8aa	he will look like a King of Pentacles: The essence of earth behaving as air, such as a diamond: A true businessman, with a gift for identifying opportunities and taking advantage of them. A person well informed about the world, skilled in all things physical, and eager to encourage others. A pillar of practicality and dependability, embracing tried and tested methods, and possessing an innate understanding of the material reality. A philanthropist and devotee of both luxury and hard work, whose word is as good as gold. <br>   The card second from the right represents the physical vision: how the object is seen at a base or mechanical level. Page of Wands: The essence of fire behaving as earth, such as wood or coal: The surprising appearance of a new passion. An adventurer who blazes through life, acting as a catalyst that others may harness. The intense enthusiasm and childlike imagination that fuels any new venture, needing only the application of mind and material to make it a success. Inner fire that can drive away fear and replace it with fury. Can represent a person of some timidity, but whose innate passion can be easily ignited. May indicate the birth of a child. <br>   The card in the middle represents the mental vision: the object personified and seen through a humanized perspective. Four of Pentacles (Power): Cleaving to earthly power in the desperate fear that it will be lost. Making yourself an obstacle to progress due to lack of originality and a desperate fear of change. Believing that security and identity are based primarily on the possession of material things. Coveting things and people. Living in a cloud of suspicion and prejudice. <br>   The card second from the left represents the emotional vision: how passions and values are creatively stimulated by the mental vision. Six of Swords (Science): Trusting in intelligence and intuition and setting off into the unknown. Leaving an untenable situation and charting a new course. Passage from difficulty and progress towards a solution. The road to recovery. Travel and exploration. <br>   The card on the far left represents the fourfold or mystical vision: still viewing through the previous three, we now add a spiritual element, revealing unseen aspects of the object. The Tower: Unforeseen catastrophe. An abrupt change, perhaps leading to a new lifestyle and enlightenment. May indicate a broken relationship, divorce, or failure in business or career.

5QH84iq4aa	I haven't gotten to it yet, but Burn Notice is honestly one of my favorite shows on TV. I'm surprised it's not more popular. I'm catching up on the last few episdoes on fancast this weekend. Pretty excited to see what happens.
jwiko3qQaa	The New Moon soundtrack isn't available. They haven't made one yet. It'll probably be out in October/November if the movie releases as planned. But I do know Paramore will be featured again on it. I'm pretty sure they've agreed to all the the movie soundtracks.|`|GrJzw8usaa	No, the movie is not even done with production yet. The Twilight soundtrack was released right before the movie so expect it in october.|`|klzmFfjZaa	Paramore (best band in the world) will be on the soundtrack, I think. Hayley, the lead singer, is friends with Robert Pattinson and had already read the Saga and loved it. I think Paramore will be on all the soundtracks.

IWbFqtQ3aa	Unless it's recent thing, I can't remember any way to include those on a birth chart. However, someone may have figured out a way to do so.|`|LrKCLZF7aa	Pallas, Vesta, Juno and Ceres (though now classified as a dwarf planet) are very important in the chart. Chiron is classified as a comet but it's influence in the chart is also paramount. It's difficult to find the right symbolism for these astrobodies so I will give you some of them. You can rest assure that these are correct.<br>  <br>  Pallas is a logical planet and has rulership of logic, chess, technology.<br>  <br>  Vesta rules non sexual attraction, friends, charities, groups of a non profit organization.<br>  <br>  Juno rules sexual need and is the most powerful of the sexual planets. It also rules deception, lies, the love affair, children without marriage, marriage without children. It also rules spells and hexes.<br>  <br>  Ceres is the little god father of business. It rules business transactions. Ceres has a price that must be paid but can be beneficial financially.<br>  <br>  Chrion rules true love, charisma, family, career, children and the New Age. Chiron is the only planet that has Cinderella aspects. These are very beneficial.  Chiron also points to the soul mate.<br>  <br>  Though this list is not complete, I think you will find it enlightening.

m7vDHRGGaa	So many people want to get into the music business, as well as acting and modeling and other areas of entertainment.<br>  <br>  I would suggest putting videos of you playing, and producing on YouTube just to get your name out there. Who knows, you may be discovered. So many people have been discovered using YouTube.<br>  <br>  People offer seminars promising record executives will be there. Its usually a scam. I recommend going the safe, and honest way and working hard.<br>  <br>  Make the videos interesting, and people will love to watch if you are good. If you are serious promote yourself. YouTube, myspace, Twitter... There are so many options. Just act mature to be taken serious,

inSxwDhWaa	@ ilovedjd, what gives you the right to say he should not be forgiven. He is a child of God just like you and you have not lived a perfect life. <br>  <br>  I am a huge fan and we have no right to judge him. We are not God. <br>  <br>  What he did was crazy and he has to learn from this. It really doesn't matter what most people think because he still has dedicated fans who see him as Chris the entertainer, his personal life is not our business. <br>  <br>  His album sales have not suffered even though he has lost endorsement deals. <br>  <br>  Rihanna has forgiven him and God will forgive him and that's all that matters.|`|jG303M2Laa	I don't think he should be forgiven for this, but I don't think they should drop him from everything and that his music should suffer.

"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee!".<br>  <br>          - Tradu??o: Há uma passagem que eu memorizei, que me parece apropriada para esta situa??o: Ezequiel 25:17. "O caminho do homem justo é rodeado por todos os lados pelas injusti?as dos egoístas e pela tirania dos homens de mal. Aben?oado é aquele que, no nome da caridade e da boa-vontade pastoreia os fracos pelo vale de escurid?o, para quem ele é verdadeiramente seu irm?o protetor, e aquele que encontra suas crian?as perdidas. E eu os atacarei, com grande vingan?a e raiva furiosa àqueles que tentam envenenar e destruir meus irm?os. E você saberá: chamo-me o Senhor quando minha vingan?a cair sobre você".<br>          - Personagem de Samuel L.

A bíblia só contém a parte final da narrativa do Jackson.<br>  "E executarei neles grandes vingan?as, com castigos de furor, e saber?o que eu sou o Senhor, quando eu tiver exercido a minha vingan?a sobre eles."

Before you rip, you will want to decide the format and the bitrate that you want to use.  By default, windows media will create the ripped songs as WMA files.

Sin esta Los Simpson no hubiesen tenido tela de donde cortar para algunos de sus capítulos. Quien ya vio esta película sabe de que hablo, quien no, pues vea la, y no películas lelas.<br>  <br>  Star Wars<br>  <br>  Tengo que hablar de las tres primeras películas porque fueron precursores del uso de efectos especiales que para las limitantes de su a?o fue un parte aguas que hizo de esta primer entrega una revolución a nivel mundial, respecto a las tres siguientes lo único malo fue JAr JAr Binks.<br>  <br>  El Topo<br>  <br>  Si no de culto una obra a ver de Alejandro Jodorowski, muestra una de esas películas que jamas debes de dejar de ver , la trama es un tanto extra?a, si no estas acostumbrado a este tipo de obras, sin embargo esta es mi tercera película.<br>  <br>  Pulp Fiction<br>  <br>  Sin duda una de las mejores obras de los 90's el manejo del tiempo en distintas partes de la película hechas por Tarantino, creo  y rescató algo que para estos a?os se perdía en una década que iba a menos, rescato de su miseria a Travolta y continuo su ascenso del gran Bad Muther ****** (Samuel L. Jackson), esas historias que de poco en poco encajaban para crear una sola hicieron de esta una a aplaudir, siendo Uma Thurman ahora una chica Tarantino, recomendable a toda costa.<br>  <br>  Para la última no hay cabida pues desde:<br>  Reservoir Dogs, Natural Born Killers, Clockwork Orange, Trainspotting, Odisea 2001, Carlito's Way y Taxi Driver son de esas películas que no debes dejar de ver por el simple hecho de ser estas.<br>  <br>  Espero que sea suficiente.<br>  <br>  Punto.|`|2f5e8666cf760711c253b74d7eab9657aa	Star Wars<br>  Blade Runner<br>  Grease<br>  El exorcista<br>  El se?or de los anillos|`|54e2161ff8328805fd4859b57780b7c2aa	Blade Runner, Alien el 8a pasajero,  El Reino de los cielos<br>  y en general todas las de Ridley Scott<br>  Por que? porque es un maestro|`|8a4c1b998d3c956e728d1bfcc1315017aa	Pájaros.

AA11053136	Arguments for democracy:<br>  1) All people, regardless of status, birth, race or circumstance deserve equal respresentation in the body which governs them - i.e. everyone deserves equal say in how their lives are governed.<br>  2) A governing body where no single individual or group of individuals ensures that the body will not govern soley in its own interests, and will instead govern in the interests of its subjects.<br>  3) A democratic governing body guards against large-scale corruption, because the individual in power can be exposed and removed from power by the individuals they are representing.<br>  4) Certain basic freedoms of the individual - such as freedom of expression, freedom to gather in public places, freedom of movement, right to privicy and suchlike - are ensured and protected as anyone in government seeking to curtail those freedoms can be removed from office and replaced.<br>  5) Justice is open and transparent, and dicated by the will of the majority, rather than being made to serve the interests of the minority.<br>  <br>  Arguments against democracy:<br>  1) People can only make informed choices about the actions of their government and who governs them on the information they are provided with. Control the information, and you control the government and the people.<br>  2) The system relies on people wanting to be part of the process and feeling like they have control over that process. If people start to believe that their voice doesn't count, then they'll passivly by-pass the process, leaving it in the hands of those who have minority agendas.<br>  3) People need to understand how the system works and be kept informed of what is happening. If the system of governance and law becomes too complicated, people will become lost and, even with the correct information, will make poorly-informed decisions.<br>  4) People need to be educated enough to make informed decissions about their governance by weighing arguments and proposals from all sides, and deciding which one they would like to see inforced. If this skill is not taught, then people are incapable of making the 'right' choice, no matter how much information or how many choices they are given.<br>  5) People can only choose from the options presented to them. <br>  <br>  As has been commented on in the past, democracy isn't perfect, but it's the best we've found so far.|`|8caf0b479bb05d670871de9b0e4c2f37aa	Democracy can only work in two types of society.<br>  1. A melting pot like the United States.<br>  2. A society with only one ethnic and/or racial group.<br>  <br>  Democracy can not work in a place like Iraq or Yugoslavia because of the different religious/ethnic groups who refuse to get along.<br>  <br>  This is why Bush is wrong for trying to push it on Iraq.

Its really about just being on beat and going with the flow-- sum guys flow is only in there penis so all there moves are like that. I DON'T think it looks too classy to be on the dance floor doing too much. I just like to have fun if its my boyfriend or some ONE I like (not the whole party or club) I might get a little closer here and there... but not dry hump him on the dance floor I think its sleazy and never was my thing. Id rather dance solo or with my girls and have all the guys drool-- opposed to someone get-tin all my goodies I just met even if it is CALLED just dancing; its obviously more than that.

When you say stage piano, I'm assuming you will have a line out. I've got a Fender Rhodes Mark 3 stage piano from 1973, and it has a line out.

Singing rocks!!!|`|5eaad8a838b5906ad84659f496c62cd8aa	My voice coach said that a lot of people think they have to use a falsetto or "head" voice to sing higher ranges. He says this is a huge mistake and I agree that singing from the mask is a choice. Practice parting your pectorals while singing the higher range. You can do this by getting on the floor in a "push up" position or taking a similar position against the wall while singing in your upper register.

AA11601775	Zuko didn't loose his broad swords, you can see him using them in recent episodes like "The City of Walls and Secrets" or "Lake Laogai."  In the episode "The Swamp" the man at the beginning who was harassing Iroh did have broad swords like zuko's but they were not zuko's, they were just anohter pair.  The swords are a weapon available for anyone to buy such as a spear in the Avatar Universe!|`|4d5501c1774a4bfc217adf98a26ee570aa	I don't think he lost his swords because in Zuko Alone he had them.

But to answer the question. No, it's not all the same, the stuff they play on the radio may be the same constantly, but that's because that's how radio works. If you think you can do better, then buy an MP3 player, load it up with your favorite music and hit shuffle. You have no one to blame for the music you hear but yourself.

5d0cbb6410a43575123a724278183e9caa	I LOVED this movie. The movie was first class and beautifully done. As good as any production that has ever come out of Hollywood. I don't enjoy seeing movies more than once and rarely if ever buy the movie after I've see it in the theater - but I can't wait for this one to come out on Video so I can see it again and again. Kudos to X8 productions for a job well done from start to finish! We really thought this was going to be more of a "Chick Flick" yet when I talked my husband into seeing it with me; he love it as much as I did. The costumes were unbelievable as was the filming. The backgrounds of the waterfalls and castle were stunning. Finally a Christian film that sticks to the truth of the story and makes it come alive before you very eyes. I so hope that X8 Productions will make more and more and these types of movies. Christians and Jews are blessed by God and have money to spend - we just refuse to spend it on filth and violence. I really hope this will be a huge success at the box offices so that it will encourage the other film makers to follow suit with tasteful movies that the whole family can enjoy together. One Night with the King was NOT advertised on any of major stations that I saw - so I don't see how it can make the same big bucks. But if people knew how wonderful it was they'd go – again and again.|`|AA11326959	nope

3fa0b2da61e88992d0a390e413b47991aa	I thought it was a wonderful movie.  Oliver Stone did an excellent job in capturing the high paced energy that all Americans experienced that dreadful day.  The story told of the 2 men trapped was gut wrenching.  I'm thankful he had the courage and desire to take this project on.  Whether some people believe it should've been done or not doesn't matter.  It is forever a piece of history none of us will ever forget.|`|4bc49dc61f1bfb93b3216f7a574aa258aa	I didn't see it, but from what I've heard it didn't point out exactly who our enemies are, of course.|`|bfcbdfc4bae19bb2539d7c96cd5754f0aa	I thought it was excellent.  An important story about an important day in our history.  Very sensitively told, and not a whiff of politics anywhere.|`|3c537f7d496daf83af8a672d4c34d2b1aa	i don't want to see it. I have never been to NYC (but always wanted to visit). I was at work the day the towers got hit. It was such an emotional day for so many people. Whether you were there or somewhere else. I don't like pain or sorrow of my own. So I would not like to feel others pain or sorrow.I feel that if I went to the movie theater to see this movie while the incident is still fresh, I would not be able to sit there without breaking down. So I will wait until it comes out on video that way I can cry in private.|`|61e48793c36b88af8dc0a56fa63dee82aa	i am dying to see that movie i hope it is good|`|AA10962514	I saw it at a sneak preview screening. Oliver Stone, Maria Bello, and the guy who Nicholas Cage played was there with his family. They all said Thank You for attending the screening and hoped we would receive the message that the film was conveying. I thought the film was very sad but it was also realistic.|`|c873be3251b736f4e7de8a62cf2e62b4aa	I refuse to see it.  JMHO<br>  Making money on the tragedy of others?<br>  It's often done, I admit, but this is too much.<br>  My heart goes out to those who died and those left behind with a broken heart, but leave them alone to lick their wounds and have some peace. <br>  I further think the "bad guys" are drooling in their soup with all the notoriety.<br>  Sadly too many "left behind" are money mongers suing everybody and his brother. VERY sad.

c1f325498b5751edf85b7b9ec3be1759aa	They're called a locking nut.<br>  <br>  It's used a lot in guitars that have floating bridges, like the Floyd Rose, because guitars that have floating bridges go out of tune more often, those locking nuts are necessary.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately you cannot just buy locking nuts and just place them on any guitar. Take for example a Les Paul, which just uses the standard nut and has no holes to put the locking nuts in.<br>  <br>  Or it might be a capo :/|`|085cf0e5157bc88141772bac993edf0aaa	if your looking for a cheap alternative to stay in tune, wrap electrical tape the headstock right after the nut. works amazing on a bass as well.|`|3038df5ab24953aa887a03172fb3f783aa	It's either a capo or a string lock.  Nothing else makes sense.|`|AA11355439	A capo is used to clamp all the strings across one fret so the open notes become whatever that fret is, but it's not used to keep the guitar from going out of tune.  However, there is a locking nut that is designed for keeping the guitar from going out of tune.  Both can be purchased at nearly any guitar store but the locking nut would have to be matched to your guitar.|`|AA11544237	I believe what you are looking for is a capo. Doesn't keep the guitar from going out of tune, though. You should be able to find one at a good music store where they sell instruments.|`|a4f49789092a23f7d2cce413bc25ef6aaa	sounds like a capo. it's not to keep it in tune, but to transpose the key. you can get them at music stores where they sell instruments and strings and stuff.

c74f43c057bc162ca6c7a70a703dc383aa	HAVING MOM OVER FOR DINNER<br>  <br>  Brian Hester invited his mom over for dinner one night. During the course of the meal, Brian's mother couldn't help noticing how beautiful his roommate Stephaine was. Mrs. Hester had long been suspicious of a relationship between Brian and Stephanie and tonight had even made ger more curious. Over the course of the evening, while watching tthe two react with one another, Mrs. Hester started to REALLY wonder if there was more between Brian and Stepahine than met the eye.<br>  <br>  Reading his mom's thoughts, Brian spoke up "Mom, I know what you must be thinking, but I want to assure you that Stephanie and I are just roommates."<br>  <br>  About a week later, Stepahanie came to Brian asking "Ever since you had your mother over for dinner, I've been unable to find the beautiful silver gray ladle. You don't suppose she took it, do you?"<br>  Brian said "Well, I really doubt it but I'll send her an e-mail just to be sure."<br>  <br>  So Brian sat down at the computer and wrote:<br>  Dear Mom,<br>  I'm not saying that you "did" take the gravy ladle from the house.<br>  I'm not saying that you "did not" take the gravy ladle.<br>  But the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner last week.<br>  Love,<br>  Brian<br>  <br>  Several days later, Brian received an e-mail back from his mother that read:<br>  <br>  Dear Son:<br>  I'm not saying that you "do" sleep with Stephanie.<br>  I'm not saying that you "do not" sleep with Stephanie.<br>  But the fact remains that if Stephanie were sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the gravy ladle by now.<br>  Love,<br>  Mom<br>  <br>  LESSON OF THE DAY.......NEVER LIE TO YOUR MOTHER!!!|`|AA10074145	knock knock whos there me|`|AA12363813	"Is that your face?

The Jefferson County Sheriff is calling her death suspicious. WATCH<br>  <br>  "An individual that removes herself from a moving vehicle. That's suspicious right off the bat," Sheriff Oliver "Glenn" Boyer said. " What caused her to want to remove herself from that moving vehicle?"<br>  <br>  Police are not releasing the name of the driver, and he's not under arrest. He is a 31-year-old Pacific car repair shop owner, who Police say was a friend of the victim.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  The article continues.

They have not posted anything useful on their website, but they may tell you something if you call and say you are a close friend of the victim. The telephone number for your sheriff's office is (636) 797-5000.<br>  <br>  You may also want to hire a private investigator.

One is a contemplative, solitary being, while the other enjoys discussions. Pisces seeks absolute love and emotional intensity; if the Gemini can stretch his or her imagination to attain the emotional commitment which is alien to him or her, the couple will experience an extraordinary spiritual union. They share a taste for freedom: the Fish to explore his imaginary world, while the Gemini craves a chance to display charisma in the outer world.

Not that he's a lying bastard as such, it's just that he always sees two sides to everything, but sometimes he's forced to say something definite and, well he has to say something and so he comes out with a rough approximation of what he thinks, at that moment...and then says the opposite later. Ms Pisces is unlikely to be very impressed by this since her particular thang is much more on the mystical oneness and unity of everything. Of course this makes it difficult to speak the truth (and the whole truth) as well, and one starts to wonder how you are two are ever going to communicate. Maybe the best bet is if he tries being incredibly affectionate, but that might not be easy for him.<br>  <br>  Pisces Man - Gemini Woman Relationship"<br>  <br>  Don't let something like astrology get in your way if you love each other though.

The elements of air and water are quite different. Air relates to the mind, and water has to do with emotions — this gives you a hint about the focus of your activity and how well you’re likely to get on.<br>  Pisces experiences life in a more intuitive and instinctive way than you. They are into the not so concrete. They make decisions based on their gut feelings. You, on the other hand, need tangible proof before you will accept things. You may not see the sense in the way Pisces makes decisions.<br>  Both of you change your views as easily — and as often — as you change your clothes, and both of you look for variety and excitement in life. However, you are motivated by different things. Each day will be an adventure when you’re together, but it will be full of downs as well as ups.<br>  The way you experience love is poles apart. Gemini, you like to use your mind in your dealings with others. Pisces won’t necessarily shy away from social banter or other people’s company, but tends to be more focused on being receptive, and to communicate on a subtler level.<br>  If you want to bond deeply with Pisces, you’ll need to show them that you understand the deeper aspects of life. Pisces needs to know that you are not completely superficial — initially they may feel you are far too scattered or worldly for them. <br>  Be sensitive to the more receptive side of Pisces and prove to them that you are not all froth and bubble. This means sometimes being silent when you’re together. Doing this will gain the respect of Pisces — and you may learn a little about what lies beneath your conscious (and sometimes chattering) mind.<br>  Pisces born between 19 February and 28 February are the most idealistic, spiritually — if you give them the chance, they will zoom your imagination out beyond your wildest dreams. They are very gifted psychically too. If you can tune your minds together, in sync, you will know each other’s thoughts and feelings.<br>  Pisces born from 1 March to 10 March are highly emotional and volatile, and are probably a little harder for you to connect with — this is because the Moon and Cancer have sway over them. They are extremely sensitive, so you must constantly monitor what you say and how you say it. They are easily offended.<br>  If it’s passion you’re after, and plenty of it, you’ll do well with those born between 11 March and 20 March, as Scorpio co-presides over their hearts. Lovemaking will be great with this lot, but expect some fierce intellectual competition from them as well — you could have some thrilling, but edgy, conversations."

If I have a project to do for school I mostly use the internet to find information and it is extremely helpful and you can learn a lot.  But there are sites that you can waste your time playing games or reading information that is useless and incorrect.|`|AA11841472	I've actually thought this question before<br>  <br>  I have to say dumber|`|b28ac4022e3231c4c797a7d1366bb309aa	definitely dumber|`|hXyzWaXxaa	It will make people dumber cause hardly anyone has the thirst for knowledge that would save them from letting their brains turn to mush by filling it with "entertainment"|`|lSyBbdajaa	Well, i am only 16 and i remember when i was in grade 2, all the other older kids used to talk about going to the library and doing their h/m there.But then ,as the years went on, I kinda expected to have to do the same, only computers and the internet came and soon i forgot about the library and all the books there. No I just use the internet. <br>  <br>  I still love books, but i buy my own now, i dont get the from the lib. <br>  <br>  So...I think that the internet has already dumbed us all down a bit, with all the information to be found all in one place and all that horrible stuff ppl can access. Just like TV<br>  <br>  BUT, the internet has also opend up my eyes to many new things . Just like TV. unlike TV though, it has saved me a lot of time studying and doing my h/m. ; )<br>  <br>  So i guess that it depends on who u r personally, whether u will let stuff like that make u dumber or if u will use it to ur advantage (mentally).

I don't talk about them much or even put them on my list of favorite bands but I do think highly of them. They are really good but for some reason they just don't PULL me in like Cryptopsy, Voivod, Born Of Osiris. I have a passion for BIZARRE, STRANGE, Technical, Chaotic, Off The Wall Riffs that have major music theory but appear they make so sense whatsoever. lol... Daath have killer song structure the do some off the wall stuff. I love melodic structural stuff I love playing it more than I do listening to it. But I appreciate it either way. <br>  <br>  I know a Crazy, Bizarre, Talented guy named Jason Suecof that tried to audition for this band I think its been a while. Hes mainly a producer he has worked for Chimaira. It was hilarious. He is just not fit for a serious metal project like Daath. Maybe like Mr. Bungle Meets Brutal Death Metal lol|`|9ntoGPFyaa	the funny thing is, I guess that correctly. Probably because Ozzfest 2009 being cancelled has been on my mind, and so it made me recall to their performance in 2007, but they're not too bad. A little generic as far as death metal goes, but the techno sound has a pretty good kick to it.

f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	Persephone, please unblock Nirvana Boy. By blocking him you are critical damaging his self esteem. Nirvana Boy has made many contributions to Rock and Pop including reminding us that Nirvana exists and having Nirvana as a permanent source. By blocking a non troll you are breaking the valuable trust and unity of the R&P community. Because he is unable to indenify your motive to block him he is left very confused and unable to function in his everyday life. I even saw him making a typo, listing "Nirbana" as his source instead of "nirvana", because this is perhaps the most common word he types one can tell he is in emotional distress. <br>  <br>  Thank you.|`|A1PLJKhUaa	Don't know him/her but it sucks that you got blocked.

As to whether Persephone wants to unblock You or not, well that's up to Her and as far as I am concerned since She's been here two years and You've been here a few months She's doesn't owe You any explanation whatsoever.<br>  <br>  And good luck with that.<br>  <br>  Anyone that wants to have a barrell roll attacking this post I don't care one bit and am utterly disinterested in fighting You, have fun.<br>  <br>  I know several People longstanding Regs that do and no, I'm not going to say who.

80II1Wv1aa	It's just a little over the top for comedic value at some parts  i think. Plus it's a little overly light-hearted I would guess. But it's not like I was alive in the 50s, so I can't say exactly.<br>  <br>  The DVDs for 2 & 3 are simply re-releases. <br>  The first film is a "Collector's Edition" with a bonus disk that includes all the footage from Back to the Future… The Ride (from Universal Studios theme park), including the lobby que loop, the pre-show, and the entire ride itself. Also, it will feature the infamous Back to the Future Part II preview special hosted by Leslie Nielsen which orginally aired November 17, 1989 on NBC. Lastly it's got a new documentary called Looking Back to the Future.|`|otcjMagiaa	Yeah, I think it was actually a documentary. Ha ha, j/k. Other than time travel, yes, the past was portrayed pretty accurately.<br>  <br>  And the new DVDs are all 2-disc.

Clothing cars and buildings were pretty accurate but people are people and always have been so the folks looking at the characters you see on the screen is like looking through rose colored glasses.<br>  <br>  Biggest example - there is no mention of the Korean war anywhere or the nuclear threat which permeated 1950's culture.|`|4s46n7KVaa	I watch online high quality movies for free here<br>  <a href="http://www.blemax.com/?p=343" rel="nofollow">http://www.blemax.com/?p=343</a><br>  but you must download a porgram i think named zango to get the free access!<br>  <br>  hope this help

AA11665941	Did you check out the library to see if they have anything with that video? The only other options would be to purchase a DVD with the Hot For Teacher video on the collection or tape it from the TV when you know it's coming on. Obviously YouTube has deleted this awesome video from their collection.<br>  <br>  Wait until Van Halen announce a tour date in your area, though. With what Eddie is going through, a Van Halen tour may not happen.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

The Silver Surfer has no choice, but to work for him. It was a deal he struck with the devourer to save his own planet from destruction, so that's how he got his unhappy job as the Silver Surfer.

Sabés cual era mi problema? No sabia administrar la libertad que tenía en la U ya que siempre estuve restringido en el bachillerato. Ya podia fumar, si no queria no entraba, siempre me iban a pagar la U. Aprendí a fumar y bebia cerveza hasta que ya no tenía dinero.<br>  Esa etapa pasó... la carrera la completé en 8 a?os  y era de 5... Ya tengo 10 a?os de graduado, me considero exitoso en mi trabajo, asi que no te preocupés que si sos constante lo vas a lograr...solo hay que aterrizar y descubrir que es lo que te está pasando.<br>  ánimo, puede que estés estudiando algo que no te guste y no pasa nada...

Entonces resulta irreverente andar reprobando.<br>  <br>  Si en este momento hay otras situaciones que requieren más atención de tu parte (trabajo, familia). Entonces arréglalas y luego regresa a la Universidad.<br>  <br>    Pero  no hay razones válidas para andar reprobando. REcuerda que todo va a quedar en tu certificado.

Frank Sinatra, Harry Connick Jr., S Club 7, die Wise Guys)  interpretiert worden.<br>  Ausserdem ist der Text schon sehr rührig (ab an die Taschentücher!): es geht um einen Mann, der nach 3 Jahre im Gef?ngnis endlich entlassen wird. Er hat seiner Liebsten geschrieben, dass er rauskommt, aber nicht wei?, ob sie auf ihn gewartet hat und ihn noch liebt. So bittet er sie darum, eine gelbe Schleife um die Eiche zu binden, als Zeichen für ihn. Wenn er keine Schleife sieht, dann bleibt er im Bus, f?hrt weiter und gibt sich selbst die Schuld für die Trennung. Dann hat er nicht die Traute selbst rauszuschauen und bittet den Busfahrer darum auf die gelbe Schleife zu achen..... na und dann sind da ganz viele gelbe Schleifen.... Man, muss Liebe sch?n sein.<br>  Ich liebe Happy Ends!<br>  <br>  Hier noch der gesamte Text: <br>  <br>  I'm coming home.

950fbc0fdd07e3750d2b16c89dad0dc0aa	Don't Lie to Mom <br>  <br>  <br>  John invited his mother over for dinner. During the meal, his mother couldn't help noticing how beautiful John's roommate was. She had long been suspicious of a relationship between John and his roommate, and this only made her more curious.<br>  <br>  Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between John and the roommate than met the eye. Reading his mom's thoughts, John volunteered, "I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, Julie and I are just roommates."<br>  <br>  About a week later, Julie came to John and said, "Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the beautiful silver gravy ladle. You don't suppose she took it, do you?" John said, "Well, I doubt it, but I'll write her a letter just to be sure."<br>  <br>  So he sat down and wrote "Dear Mother, I'm not saying you did take a gravy ladle from my house, and I'm not saying you did not take a gravy ladle. But the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner."<br>  <br>  Several days later, John received a letter from his mother which read: "Dear Son, I'm not saying that you do sleep with Julie, and I'm not saying that you do not sleep with Julie. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the gravy ladle by now. Love, Mom."<br>  <br>  Lesson of the day...

sTZstr30aa	Heeeeeere's what happened. Part of the comedic sidekick's tragic flaw has been his big heart. McMahon "is an extremely generous human being to his own detriment," said David Fisher, who collaborated with McMahon on his autobiography, "For Laughing Out Loud" and his latest book, "When Television Was Young." <br>  <br>  "Ed is someone who loves to make people happy," revealed Fisher, who added that the munificent McMahon would drop dough everywhere. "Being Ed McMahon was an expensive proposition," he said. A lot of cash "went to tips," noted Fisher, who recalled walking through hotel lobbies with McMahon as he would hand out money to anyone who helped him. The TV fixture also spent a fortune helping to launch his third wife Pam's clothing company. By most accounts, even though the designs, which were sold at Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus and reportedly worn by Paula Abdul and Sharon Stone, were well received, the high-priced fashion line fizzled. <br>  <br>  And while money was going out, little was coming in. Incredibly, Carson's second banana of 30 years has said he doesn't receive residuals from the successful DVD box sets of "The Tonight Show." The 85-year-old also hasn't been able to work since he broke his neck in a fall a year-and-a half ago. Fisher recounted how a day or two after McMahon was injured, the TV fixture instead stuck to his commitment to review the manuscript for "When Television Was Young," rather than going to the hospital.|`|KSeuTqtIaa	dgffggdfger5t54t5g|`|GCl84SPLaa	Whatever, he is in the hospital now and things don't look good.<br>  <br>  However, he is married to a much younger woman and I doubt she married him because he is a stud.|`|8ed1c4b4b5ab2e0f6329de8048b39995aa	Its amazing how easy it is to get carried away spending.<br>  <br>  If you stop keeping track, you never see it go!

tqQH3S1Saa	Bueno el motivo fundamental es que a veces solemos usar toallas de otros o darles a otros nuestras toallas para que las use.<br>  Pero volcandome mas concretamente a la pregunta, es que a veces al secarnos pasamos la toalla por partes de nuestro cuerpo que pueden tener peque?os hongos, tambien al secarnos entre las nalgas recolectamos particulas fecales,<br>  y por ultimo, las celulas muertas de la piel que son desprendidas durante y luego del ba?o quedan colectadas entre los hilos de las toallas formando con el tiempo el clasico color a mugre...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Lic.

Cuando nos ba?amos desprendemos celulas y algunas de esta pueden quedar atrapadas en el pa?o, tambien el pH del cuerpo influye.|`|f0aQUZh4aa	yo si la lavo porque aveces nos limpiamos los pies <br>  y luego se nos olvida tenderla y se huele feo pues por eso la tenemos que lavar o tu no la lavas ......|`|fIlhnJcVaa	Interesante si... pero ya esta muy usada tu pregunta...<br>  La toalla se debe lavar porke al frotar con ella nuestra piel , se desprenden peque?as partículas de la misma , que como son células muertas se descomponen y le dan mal olor a las toallas.

Which is why the american and Japanese versions are titled differently.<br>  <br>  Seven was released for the Playstation and Eight and Nine followed afterwards (Seven was later released for the Pc). Ten and Twelve were released for the Playstation 2. Eleven was released for the Playstation 2 and the Pc and in a break from tradition was an online MMORPG (massive multiplayer online role playing game).<br>  <br>  They are all set in different world with different characters.<br>  They all have reccuring themes, such as (usually) a love story and the whole having to save the world thing. There are some recurring characters and races. The battle system and magics etc are also sorta the same.<br>  <br>  There were spinoff games such as Chocobos Dungeon 1+2, Chocobo Racing, FF X-2 (the only direct spinoff), Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Dirge of Cerberus, Final Fantasy : Crisis Core (for mobiles), Final Fantasy Advance and Tactics Advance.<br>  The as yet unreleased games are FF Tactics Advance Lion Wars and FF12 Revenant Wings.<br>  <br>  There was also a film Advent Children based on 7. Also based on 7 was a short film , Last Order. <br>  <br>  There is also a Final Fantasy anime.<br>  <br>  I think thats it...i need to go lie down...|`|jIe9t4Uhaa	Ok then final fantasy started as a pc game and it is a long game.Then it came on tv the first movie called spirits whithin which was pretty cool.Then it came my best movie ever you MUST see it if you havent yet called final fantasy VII advent children.It also has a tv series called final fantasy unlimited and a small ova the last order.I download it from limewire but i dont know where else you can download it.Take a look here.<br>  <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=3344" rel="nofollow">http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=5561" rel="nofollow">http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=639" rel="nofollow">http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=613" rel="nofollow">http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...</a><br>  Thats all hope i helped.|`|523ef0fae6b39bfc436fe3f0a0e61d80aa	It's....confusing.

EhBYJVlsaa	Well, when you add dynamics to what you are singing it can change it up a little so it doesn't quite sound exactly the same every time.  dynamics are how loud or soft you play/sing something.  so like a lot of times people will start a song quieter and then at the bridge or chorus, they will get louder and then maybe go back down a little.  <br>  <br>  You can also put amphasis on certain words. like the ones that you really think re important you can put emphasis on them.  To change it up, try putting emphasis on different words each time you repeat it or wutevr.<br>  <br>  Try mixing up the beats so they arent exactly the same every time.  changing the rhythms slightly adds interest<br>  <br>  finally trills.  trills make something less boring as well.  just dont do too many or it gets excessive and can be annoying :)|`|rZUThLfMaa	stop repeating things?

Jaw2sW3eaa	Theo was send to look for Patrick by his white neighbour who knows Patrick from the past.<br>  I read that this white man sends Theo [a black man] to look for Patrick because it looks better.<br>  I do not know exactly why he sends him to Walford but I think it has something to do with what happened in the past when they were younger.|`|ZEsOcxcoaa	i thought patrick was back in jamaica in the 50s,and came over in the 70s and may have fathered denise but turned out it was geoffrey from fresh prince,and anyway why would patrick be worried about being known as a riot starter,all those years ago,he'd be put up as a hero not a villain .crap writing as usual|`|qR2G2WcMaa	Did u watch Tuesdays epsiode? it was all about Patrick and how he started a riot in the 1950's, im not sure why Theo is SO interested in it all though, its very dodgey but im sure we'll find out soon , lets just hope it doesnt drag on too long like the Danielle / Ronnie story is xx|`|0e30db1991b7d2ef05edf73b241560e9aa	something to do with patricks past - he is either his grandson or he is something to do with the people patrick beat up when he was younger<br>  <br>  a bit of a lame storyline if you ask me|`|e76k5edZaa	The story line is a load of balls<br>  not even worth waiting for!|`|hSOfnvuaaa	I havent got a clue but i cant wait to find out!|`|NRjwqmn9aa	Yeah, do you know I've been wondering that too I mean who is this Theo where did he come from and want does he want, and why did EE come up with this storyline haven't they got bigger fish to fry, for e.g. Dawn and Garry getting engaged for e.g. or getting this Nick and Dotty storyline out of the way?
NQ37mnWkaa	I listen to a wide variety of genres. <br>  <br>  I grew-up on a mix of Rock / Classic Rock / Prog Rock / Pop-Rock / Rock 'n' Roll. <br>  Everything else, I discovered for myself...|`|785d07b11864df1b07a99374609e381eaa	Well...I guess I just started listening when starting hearing more bands. I really don't remember how exactly I got into it. But one thing's for sure, I'm never coming out of it.|`|5b218420f6e58d52278efc9527f29a95aa	The first music I was exposed to was from the 60's and 70's, so I'm really into older stuff, specifically rock. Once I started to develop my own tastes I found myself getting into more obscure stuff because bands like that tend to be really focused on music-writing rather than image or touring. There are definitely mainstream bands I like, but I gravitate towards the ones with distinction and originality. I'm kind of all over the place with genres I like.|`|rRCTvT7Saa	I'll listen to almost anything really--country, rock, blues, jazz, surf rock, gypsy jazz, rockabilly, western swing, bluegrass, 80's metal, etc.<br>  <br>  I first got into rock thanks to my dad, whose favorite band was and still is the classic rock band Badfinger.  Then, I got into heavier stuff, from Cinderella up to Iced Earth, thanks to my brother.  Country came in later when I started to get sick of rock radio.  Thanks to country guitar virtuoso Brad Paisley, I started to get into jazz.<br>  <br>  How did I get into bluegrass?  Because of country...now I can't get enough Ricky Skaggs and his great mandolin playing!  Plus, his guitarist, Cody Kilby, is fantastic!  As for western swing, gypsy jazz and surf rock, I basically got into those sub genres (and all other sub genres I'm a fan of) because of the main genres--rock, country, blues and jazz.|`|9ntoGPFyaa	I get angry really easily, and anybody with anger issues can't dislike metal. I've never seen it happen before.|`|AA11618061	grew up on parents lp's and 45's<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  mmm|`|IgztWp0uaa	I spent my elementary years in New Orleans. By middle school I always hung out with older kids/had a boyfriend who would get me into clubs. I was really lucky to get to see the artists I got to see. I really thought nothing of going to see Fats Domino, Muddy Waters, Johnny Lee Hooker,Junior Wells, etc. I distinctly remember when I first saw Acid Bath, Skynard, etc. My great gma was an opera singer, so I learned to love both classical and opera through her and my gma (her daughter) from the time I was a child. I also thought nothing of going to concerts in the Superdome, the Jazz Fest, the VooDoo Fest, Essence Fest... it was just what I did.<br>  We also had a baptist church right down from one of our fav sandwich shops. On Sundays I would go get a sandwich and sit on a bench near the church and listen to the music, etc. (I'm Buddhist, so I really was an outsider listening in...)<br>  I guess it is in my blood because it was always around me. I never appreciated it until I had to move into the buckle of the bible belt when in high school. You can imagine the "culture shock" for both them and me....a buddhist metalhead punk/kinderwhore  plopped into the middle of cow country... lol!|`|nRObJuJeaa	i became  a fan of european goth rock after i first heard HIM when i was 14. after that i learned of other finnish bands, and even some other bands not from finland that had similar sounds.|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	I discovered my dads nirvana cd when i was in 6th grade so i opened it up and saw kurt cobain flipping off the camera and i thought that was the coolist thing in the world.|`|yS61H04haa	With darkwave, I discovered one band Faith and Disease.

d8ox561maa	Perfumes dated far back before plastic was even invented. We associated perfumes with being rich, sophisticate, power and classic and glass bottles were used in the "olden days".

cedd1ebbd97006377a363d105b88f47caa	Me parece que estuvo bastante bien su participación y con esa voz le dió un toque de fuerza maravilloso, tengo entendido que su participación fue breve porque en el momento de la filmación él andaba de gira o algo por el estilo y solo tenía una semana para grabar su colaboración en la película (lo escuché de los propios labio de keith)<br>  supongo que si hay una cuarta parte y tiene más tiempo seguro lo veremos.|`|2e9bc258b3ede4a4503c58d8a56ed006aa	la verdad que si la verdad que tuvo una actuacion bastante buena! <br>  yo pensaba: como va a ser? el es un guitarrista no un actor!<br>  pero admitadmoslo,flaco mas simpatico que el no hay!=)<br>  aunque a pesar de que fue poca su participacion,duro mas de lo que yo esperaba;si hasta tiene dialogo y todo! jaja<br>  espero que si se llega a hacer una 4ta parte aparezca mas! como dijo alguien antes;seria como tener dos jack!;)<br>  grosso keith "dos tomas"!

I like alternative music and dispise others, but I do not insult anyone whose taste differs from my own. That guy sounds like an A #1 jerk.

Don't let others define you!
1d496d052b0aac58ccbb282475ddb71baa	Sadly, there is not. Comedy Central has decided not to renew the show. It's hilarous and its one of the best CC shows ever, in my opinion. I think it's a bit underappreciated because of its comedic antics.
mqgS6Dfxaa	Gumby and Pokey were claymation characters from the 60's.   <br>  Using a modern substitution we have....<br>  <br>  I was watching Supernatural and Dean was saying something about a Sponge Bob Girl who he obviously liked and was asking himself if that made him Squidward.<br>  <br>  Hmmm, it still doesn't make sense, does it?|`|NkHU8tEJaa	Obviously everyone else missed the full joke also.<br>  <br>  Gumby is a green guy yeah, but the way he said it, it means "inexperienced girl" (probably related to her sex life, maybe a virgin?)<br>  <br>  Green = inexperienced.<br>  <br>  Gumby was green...<br>  <br>  And Pokey was Gumby's sidekick, but he is probably also using the word to refer to her giving him an erection.<br>  <br>  So he probably meant: She is inexperienced... does that make me sexually attracted to her?<br>  <br>  Get it?|`|XbZIicftaa	The character Gumby's sidekick was named Pokey:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://srjerman.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/gumby-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://srjerman.files.wordpress.com/2008...</a><br>  <br>  Gumby is the green one :)|`|V3mT9E3Xaa	gumby is an old cartoon and pokey was his best friend and his horse. look up gumby|`|5yN05Habaa	sorry that is a hard joke.

However, there are many good people running small businesses who do their best to balance fairness between customers, employees and their personal needs and aspirations.  If shareholders, Boards and executives of corporations could get back to the basics of customer and staff welfare being of prime importance, the world could be a much better place.<br>  <br>  Sadly, however, with the big boys social conscience takes a back seat to greed, both corporate and personal.|`|7gH7sgi6aa	I think Americans fail to realize that there are still a lot of good American business owners who do not get credit for taking care of their employees and clients.  There are a lot of businesses who outsourced simply because of cheap labor and cheap taxes but in the end lost because of inferior products or service.  So my answer is neither.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|XaL7cAqNaa	Neither.

He got laid off b/c he was one of the higher paying ppl there....he also trained a guy a few months ago that is most likely going to take his position for a fraction on the pay.  <br>  <br>  Within the same week of her husband getting laid off....she got laid off from our company.  <br>  <br>  They have a 10 year old little boy and house with 2 car payments ect.  <br>  <br>  I have empathy.  thats just sad.|`|ndhEsOaOaa	neither?|`|RfCcMazsaa	overpowered by my apathy|`|AA11238703	i work hard to develop/deepen my empathy|`|ylzLVdOGaa	good question. but I have no answer. that's something to ponder.

8vGq6cRTaa	They are selling T-shirts, posters, and some other gear at the concerts so far.<br>  <br>  Private meet and greet before most concerts and only people with passes won through local hit radio stations can get in.<br>  <br>  No organized public meet/sign opportunity.  Try waiting for an hour or more outside at their bus after the show and cross your fingers.  Some people have had a brief chance there.|`|f42d397760b7105b553fe711e7bb2cf7aa	No one's quite sure with how the meet and greets work. I suggest just getting there early, especially because it's general admission. They do sell t-shirts and posters there.|`|VAu1MfR1aa	The only meet and greets are ones that are hosted by local radio stations.  Not every place will have these, but if you're wondering you could check with your local station just to see.  Yes, they sell 3 t-shirts that we know of... a pink one with his name and a design, a black one with a serious photo, and a tour one with a photo of him wearing a hat.  They sell a poster, hoodie, tote bag, etc too.

AA11633561	The name of the movie is "Heavy" (1995). It stars Pruitt Taylor Vince as Victor, an overweight man who owns a small restaurant with his mother (Shelley Winters). He becomes obsessed with Callie (Liv Tyler), a new waitress his mother hired. Since he's also the cook he spends a lot of time around the girl. He likes taking pictures of the restaurant and his employees. He shows the pictures around but keeps some of the photos of Callie to himself. He becomes jealous when Callie's boyfriend visits her at the restaurant.<br>  I saw this movie when it first came out and I agree with you. It is a good movie. Fine performances from Vince, Tyler and Winters.  Singer Deborah Harry (of the rock band Blondie) is a standout as a bitter waitress who becomes jealous of Callie's popularity at the restaurant. I've attached a link.
f2cb49a377611821ef522c3ff55e0cf8aa	because guys dont need a special connection to experience sex as opposed to women......they need a special "love" connection when theyre having sex and watching porn does not do it for most women. men are more physical and can experience sex without commitments and attatchment. men are also really horny and therefore the porn industry is catered to men. obvious answer is because thats where their $$$ revenue is going to come from. there is a strong demand for it, and ppl are going to make what sells. all to make money, even if it may mean "desexualizing" women as you described. you just gotta see porn for what it is. its porn. its more of a fantasy and an experience. it does not always depict real life sex 100% of the time...........it depicts mens fantasies and thats where it grabs the consumer. money talks. thats life. we gotta deal with it.|`|AA11095290	Women desexualize themselves by not putting out and thinking their poop don't stink.  So men do what they can.  The porn industry's growth is indicitive of the repressed sexual needs of men.  If men got it when they needed it, there would be little to no demand.

Her screen name IS Miley Cyrus. Her real name is Destiney Hope Cyrus. I'll tell u the story on how she got "Miley". When she was young, she smiled a lot. Her dad, Billy Ray Cyrus, called her Smiley. When her brothers and/or sisters got older, coundn't pronounce "Smiley", so they called her "Miley". That is the story of how she got her screen name. Here are some Miley/ Destiney fun-facts.<br>  <br>  --When Miley first audditions, she actully wanted to be Lilly. She did so good, they made her Miley.<br>  --The makers of Hannah Montana were gonna' make the name for Miley not eh show, "Zoey". Billy Ray didn't like that so he had an argument and made it "Miley".<br>  --Did you know Miley has a lot of brothers and sisters?<br>  <br>  <br>                I hope this helped! Stay an awesome fan of Miley!

1dadfd832fbfa7cc8df851ccfe3f3caaaa	There is a TON of stuff to deal with when making an AMV.<br>  <br>  First, you need your footage. Now this means video files of your anime on your computer, not DVDs - real mpeg, mpg, wmv, or avi files. All work with WMM. Now if you do not have these, you can not create.<br>  <br>  First timers with WMM are prone to downloading videos from other creators and splicing up those videos to fit their own. I understand that if you don't have the video and its your first time, but don't make a habit of it. It gets tired and even alot more, viewers that have seen the original AMV recognize the original video in your AMV.<br>  <br>  Most people get fansubbed episodes on the net and use those, or else RAWS themselves. Many others, like myself use capture cards to copy the video on DVDs to the computer. These cards hook up to a DVD player and record the video they play out.<br>  THough some production companies have learned to jinx their disks, such as Funimation, as Fruits Basket and Ranma 1/2 both are completely washed out and are not even worth copying.<br>  When this happens, people buy Chinese rips of the DVDs. THese are cheaper and have no encoding to deal with. <br>  I have a Hellsing CHinese rip DVD set that I used and its wonderful.<br>  <br>  Next is your music. ANything will do, but I stress to the UTMOST do not use a song and an anime b/c they're your favorite. YOu make an AMV because the music flows with the animation creation that you made.<br>  Like.. "Oh my Favorite Song is Sexyback! OMG I havta to make a FLCL music video to it!!!"<br>  No, no, no. Unless you are totally SURE that you can make that video without creating a cliche, don't do it. ALot of first timers make videos that are not worth watching because their fandom has taken over the creation.<br>  But many times, look over your music collection and search for a song that may fit a certain anime. - LIke "She Hates Me" to Ranma 1/2. The logistics work.<br>  Also, listen to the radio more, as their music is more open and change styles all the time. You might just hear a song that you never heard before and love it because it fits a certain anime perfectly.<br>  <br>  But basically its alot of synching the music to spots of anime, cutting at certain spots and seeing the ideal AMV in your head.<br>  Please, when you make a video, do not do more than 8 second lengths of straight video from the anime. Meaning do not just put in a strip of video and say "Oh this works" and its the first 15 seconds of the anime, where everyone has already seen. Its not new, and quite boring to the eyes.<br>  <br>  Many people actually create an 'outline' where they put on paper the certain parts of the anime to fic to the music's words.<br>  I don't do that. I let the creation flow evenly as I work.<br>  <br>  But try to create three videos, good videos before showing the world your creations. You will have learned techniques and gotten better during that time. <br>  Don't think that I am not deterring you to play around. PLease do.<br>  Many famous videos herein are from times when AMV creators just went freaky in creation one night.<br>  Try, try again, thats all you can do.|`|QOfFOUghaa	Well, you need to got to start and then Windows Movie Maker. You can import some clips (video, songs, pix) from ur albums on your pc. Then you just compile them together however you want. You can shorten the musiicclipandstuff.

TGKjkKLSaa	Well first things first try smaller events like roller rinks or maybe county or city fairs and festivals. Maybe try to get yourselves hear on the radio a bit f you have any original songs. Wether it's big radio or small online or fm lot's of stations will play young people as well. (we are one of em) Get yourself on myspace too. Sign up under artist not regular myspace and upload your songs, info, and dates when your playing and such. You can start a fan base that way and of course fans will always fight to get you to come play near them. You never know someone might own a place that needs a live band or have a parent that does or even know someone who needs a live band. The possabilities are endless. Hope that helps ya a little. If you have some originals email our station owner i'm sure he'd play em for ya. stormyradio@yahoo.com either way good luck sounds like you got a good start going especially with asking help with questions like that.|`|523ef0fae6b39bfc436fe3f0a0e61d80aa	" Do what you believe in."--Jack Kirby<br>  Yeah, you guys should go for it, you're not too young.

Rock on!|`|0707ffd81ccff99c1c4ed83a329196b6aa	I think it's awesome that you're rolling with this.  <br>  You are right, however, it could be very hard to get some gigs at your age.  <br>  First thing.....is there any kind of talent show, dance, or anything similar planned at your school?  If so, that is a PERFECT opportunity to get your band out there. <br>  Also, I really like the idea that someone mentioned of having a party and inviting people over to hear you play.  <br>  Another suggestion.....find places where kids your age hang out, and approach the management of those places to see if you can play.  Don't expect to get paid.....at least not the first time....in fact, I encourage you to tell them that you'll play the first time for free.  And I would definitely have an adult with you when you approach these places....just so they know you are serious.  <br>  Also, it may sound corny, but go to places like Chuck-E-Cheese's, where smaller kids are, and ask them if you can play one night.  Again, have an adult with you so that they know you are serious.  Any kind of exposure you can get will help you.  <br>  Check out any local fairs, festivals, etc, and contact the organizers.  Again, having an adult contact them will make them take you more seriously.  <br>  Lastly, try to find family-friendly coffee houses, etc, that may be interested in you, or that have "open-mic" nights.  It would be very hard for you to get a gig in a bar, but something like a coffee house is much more possible.  <br>  Good luck!|`|7d7c2b2eb692b020a96c1c57a4de5c4aaa	me and my friends are starting a band too. you could try playing in like your basement or something and invite a few people over. If they like it you could put on shows there. Maybe set up a stage in your yard.<br>  <br>  You could also set up a MySpace page so people can hear you.

Ask them what number is on that die (1-6 of course) then ask if that reminds them of their first sexual experience and usually they'll say no.

(It will look like they're jacking off) and then ask them if THAT reminds them of their first sexual experience lol<br>  <br>  <br>  Another one would be start off about how 2 gay guys r at home and can't go to the mall as planned because it was raining so one decides to play blindfolded sherades (Or however it's spelled) then say that he blindfolds the other one and grabs a broom and shoves it up the other's rear-end. The blindfolded one says "Oh I know what that is. It's the broom handle! I like this game lets play again" so the other one gets a cucumber and does the same as he did with the broom. Now when you say the one guy went to get a uh.... ummmmm cucumber that's right (Slurred so they will get set up in the end) then say the blindfolded one gets that right too and decides to play one more. So the nblindfolded one gets the uh uh uh uh (Make motions like you're using the plunger and they'll MOST LIKELY say plunger?) Then you can say oh you played that game before?

Then you can select your "Library" and select the songs to delete. select delete from harddisk as you do that. You iPod will retain the songs however this is a problem if you do reset your iPod or it id decides to drop all your songs. I recently had My ipod erase and set all 26 gigs of my music to "other" I had to get it ALL back this is a bigger problem if you have pirated music and not the actualy CDs.

eaddc8c4451a229639feaa52584eea55aa	You are in luck.  Recently, DC Comics implemented something they called One Year Later wherein they bumped their books one year into the future.  This happened in like May of 2006 so this doesn't give you too much time to seek back issues for.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend any issue of Batman written by Grant Morrison and any issue of Detective written by Paul Dini.  The Bat-books have all been shorter stories ranging in 2 to 4 issue arcs with plenty of done-in-one stories in between.  Most of the last year of Bat-books have been released as trade paperbacks<br>  <br>  And if it's teams you like, Batman is also a member of the recently reformed JLA.  Right now it's crossing over with the JSA series in a story involving the Legion of Super-Heroes.  And the first six issues of JLA have been reprinted in a hardcover collection that is supposed to come out in stores today.  Written by novelist Brad Meltzer, who also wrote the DC series Identity Crisis.<br>  <br>  The nice thing about getting the trades and the hardbacks is you can find them all at Barnes and Nobles and at Borders as well as comic book shops.<br>  <br>  Batman books easily fill up a whole section of graphic novels.  There are so many to choose from.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Good luck and Happy Reading!|`|dd6f0c46fe46b2b9db9337ff57bbcb1caa	These days its all about mulit-book story arcs. Just be sure you pick up a book at the first issue of a new arc. The only bat title I read is Nightwing I always liked that he is a less than perfect character. I also hate it when they do cross overs. If you like team books. He is in Superman/Batman ongoing series and the new justice league of america. The Batman strikes is based on the current cartoon series. Batman Confidential is Batman early advetures. Batman and Robin the boy wonder is about his early adventures dealing more with a young dick greyson. I know do they really need 2 classic story. Detective and the main title Batman are still around and they are always coming out with self contained stories listed as Batman: ___________ check out <a href="http://dccomics.com/comics/" rel="nofollow">http://dccomics.com/comics/</a> enjoy

nwi5ZHk0aa	There are two meanings that I found on the internet that I really like:<br>  <br>  1) "To me, this song is about a guy that is doing something wrong...and as he's doing it...he hears God telling him that it's wrong, but also that He will teach him to overcome temptation. And when he sings, "Here's my kiss to betray <br>  desperate to brush the lips of grace. <br>  Do you feel hollow when you think of how I've lied?" He's talking about how the guy feels guilty for what he did wrong and he wants to be seen pure in God's eyes. And then when he says Jesus, I'm ready to come home...He's just submitting to God completely, giving up everything."<br>  <br>  2) "The first part of this song is God telling us that we are weak, and that he will make us strong. The second part, I think, is the self-doubt we feel when we think of how God sees us, as we really are. The end is the subject of the song running back to God, having seen how a life without God is empty. He submits to God's will for his life, knowing that it is better than anything he could have invisioned alone. That's what the song means to me."

q8YOXpBkaa	Yes - I was thinking much the same thing.  What's up with Tyra this season -- she's sooooo annoying!!  <br>  <br>  I think Whitney only won because Tyra (in her quest of trying so hard to be like Oprah) wanted to pick a plus-size model to make some kind of statement in society today.  Talk about trying to be Oprah, when they did the "eyes above the water" challenge and she was saying how she and her friend Robin came up with the idea on vacation - I couldn't help but think how she was trying to present herself like "Oprah and Gayle" or something.<br>  <br>  Yeah, this season's kinda over-the-top and cheap...  It used to be a not half-bad show but now I'm considering not watching it anymore....|`|IheAOYlDaa	The episode with Tyra eating an apple and pretending to be poisoned was the suckiest thing I ever saw. Then Mr. Jay kissing her to revive her and PICKING HER UP. He's alot stronger than I thought. Tyra is so into herself. I saw a reunion show of cycle 10 last week on The Tyra show and Whitney is a faky chunky chick. Anya must have been too busy modeling to attend.|`|Hf6BMR1paa	hmm i haven't really noticed but now that you say something i see it too. i think it's important to show SOME reality scenes but yes, i agree with you not so many. they are taking up more parts of the show. |`|2DGmU1W9aa	Yeah, I noticed that this season especially is nothing how it use to be. Before it would focus more on the fashion shoots and the actual modeling. Now, it's almost all about the drama in the house. Tyra seems to be making much more appearances and acting really dumb.I think it's all in an effort to boost ratings for the show, which have been slipping over the last few seasons. I think Whitney won for this reason.. to boost ratings. And it's why they had a transgender person on this season. She was pretty, but not as skilled as the others.

The show has become too predictable, they need to totally revamp the whole thing and do something really diff and more classy, like have the whole season in Paris !

Leda2ha0aa	I don't think it's too bad, especially for younger children.  I use to listen to Duran Duran and A Flock of Seagulls.  I can just imagine what went through parent's minds when they saw what the Seagulls looked like.  It's always a fad and will pass.  As long as they have a clean image, I'm OK with it.  BTW, many of those that you name above were heavy into drugs at the time they were big in the music business.|`|KkRb3paPaa	Well everyone has their own taste in music. What you call music might sound like noise to someone else.  Not everybody is gonna like the old kind of music. The Jonas Brothers are not that bad. Maybe other people like them because they have clean music, they don't cuss and talk about rude things in their music, and they are good role models. But that's just my opinion. And you don't have to be mad. You can still listen to the old music that you like. We all have our own choices.....|`|DibFrwxlaa	Because you get to look back at history through tinted glasses.  If you lived through the 50s, 60s, 70s or 80s, you would be able to come up with plenty of pop acts that drove you nuts.  But since you get a distorted view of the past by virtue of the fact that pop acts are so transient in popularity you don't know about them.<br>  <br>  |`|xsUaHA8Zaa	Every generation has had their own version of the Jonas Bros.  When I was young, it was the Osmond Bros., the Defranco Family, the Partridge Family, etc.  Even the Monkees were prefabricated.<br>  <br>  The Jonas Bros. thrive because they're making a ton of money for Disney and their record label.|`|37qOjwDraa	Take it on an optimistic point of view: <br>  <br>  We are LUCKY, because we're not Jonas or whatever-crap fans; we can distinguish what sucks and what rocks. This age, we're not obliged to love those bands because we're "enlightened".|`|AA10795350	Our generation also has:<br>  <br>  Wilco<br>  The White Stripes<br>  TV on the Radio<br>  Red Hot Chili Peppers<br>  Radiohead<br>  R.E.M.<br>  Queens of the Stone Age<br>  Oasis<br>  My Morning Jacket<br>  The Libertines<br>  Kings of Leon<br>  Coldplay<br>  Broken Social Scene<br>  etc.<br>  <br>  Every generation has a couple lame/goofy bands. The '60s had The Archies, we have The Jonas Brothers, etc. But the bands I listed above are GREAT. So don't feel too bad for our generation.<br>  <br>  Maybe if you navigate away from Disney Channel and MTV and towards <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/</a> you won't have such a low, misguided opinion of today's music.<br>  <br>  P.S. "Holly Buddy"? Seriously? lol Your whole question was written in a very strange, stiff, awkward way.|`|Lch9ZjVpaa	music evolves.<br>  <br>  and honestly im tired of everyone complaining about our generations music. <br>  <br>  |`|98d9db4d2e5e9f2e1230126103949479aa	I agree with you. I hate Jonas Brother. their voices grate on my nerves. its horrid!|`|55FJ1nMHaa	I know, they suck! That's why I prefer classic music like Led Zeppelin, ZZ Top, etc.|`|voQb04Xpaa	yea right we got some good *** music:)|`|6WVJOf6Waa	hey im alfie aged 17<br>  i so agree with you<br>  im grew up with the likes of pink floyd, led zeppelin, the who, beetles, rolling stones, the doors etc and well i just dont think music is made like that (I.E. AS GOOD AS) nowerdays we get the same indie it all sounds the same and then theres the jonas brothers, u cant take them seirously can u really.. all my friends dont have good music taste im the only one that does to be honest<br>  <br>  Where are we going to put the best of music now? <br>  its there if you look properly, muse for example and radiohead, but its not as popular as this pop and r and b i just cant stand the way music is heading and has been since the early 90s, (when i was born), i think 60s 70s and 80s was by far the best decades of music... the velvet underground is the basis of most alt rock and heavy rock bands today... and 40s and 50s country/folk ,music was what inspired them uhh it just annoys me so much<br>  <br>  Alfie<br>  |`|kdVxvMXSaa	The answer is simple, there is no music industry now.  You have corporations like Sony that own so called music companies today.  I don't know about you, but when I think of Sony, I think of TVs and camcorders, not a music company.<br>  <br>  Disney is simply taking advantage of a void and chalking up the sales numbers while they can.  It's what they do.<br>  <br>  While there have always been crappy groups out there, there seems to be a plethora of them today simply because there is no company out there, sans independent labels, that are willing to take a chance on the next great band.
829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	Yes it does.<br>  <br>  On those kind of days I listen to Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan.|`|UnsZKr4saa	I think I decoded it, lol.<br>  <br>  I listen to music, of course.<br>  <br>  MQ: Pretty much every song on my playlist.  Especailly songs by Dark Tranquility, they're really deep and insightful.|`|ETFaQiTzaa	It made perfect sense to me.  : )<br>  <br>  I listen to music.  Anything soft and tranquil if I want to think--Radiohead, Jeff Buckley, Elliott Smith, Damien Rice, Ben Harper, etc.<br>  <br>  If I -don't- want to think, then I listen to loud, busy music.  I have to be careful where/when I'm doing this though.  I got pulled over because I went into automatic/robot mode while I was driving one time--listening to Thrice "For Miles", and ended up speeding...by about 30 mph.<br>  <br>  The Beatles make me feel better.  And so does writing.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I forgot thinking songs... <br>  -"Hallelujah" --Jeff Buckley<br>  -"Death is the Road to Awe"  --Clint Mansell<br>  -"The Blower's Daughter" and "Delicate" --Damien Rice<br>  <br>  And the like!|`|7B2s7maWaa	Don't worry your question makes sense and it is also a very good one. :D<br>  <br>  I either will listen to music or read a book.  I will go on Y!A it's how I escape from certain people and certain things.  I can spend hours at a time listening to music while on Y!A or reading.<br>  <br>  MA:"Crazy"-by Simple Plan<br>  "Perfect"by Simple Plan<br>  "Nobody's Home"-Avril Lavigne<br>  "Run"-Collective Soul<br>  <br>  There is a few but these are definitely top of my head.<br>  <br>  What about you?|`|MYsSyfQzaa	No it makes sense, I use music to escape everything from bad moods to problems with parents.|`|EkaX4GdAaa	I play guitar as a form of self meditation. |`|zty0tdROaa	i listen to my music and read a book (at the same time by the way)<br>  <br>  i dont think that thinkin about a song is as leisurely as just listening to them<br>  <br>  but if there is anythin i like to listen to it would have to be tomorrow's dream by black sabbath, janie got a gun by aerosmith, and the man who sold the world by nirvana|`|8Etio7HSaa	When i want to stop thinking about life, I usually listen to music!<br>  <br>  MA: Songs by: "InFlames" and "Dark Tranquillity" are pretty deep, meaningful and simply Beautiful!<br>   Also, alot of Ambient music makes me escape to another world, a complete different one!!|`|yfinBX0uaa	I am proud to admit that I am a disco and 80's fan.  If I am having a bad day and I need to feel better, just put on ABBA or Gloria Gaynor and all the problems go away.  Also Prince, Heart, Duran Duran, Skid Row, basic 80's.  Because to me it reminds me of growing up when there was no such thing as stress.  Happy times.|`|K4Nt8kZPaa	I write poetry.<br>  <br>  It's pretty much the only thing that helps me...<br>  besides listening to music ;)<br>  <br>  MQ: Pink Floyd "Comfortably Numb" and "Frozen" by Within Temptation|`|nuhJvTiCaa	The question does make sense.<br>  I like to go for walks or on long bus rides or just curling up with a good book, it just makes me feel better and relax.<br>  <br>  Edit: Obviously music and writting are two escapes for me.|`|98d9db4d2e5e9f2e1230126103949479aa	A7X and BFMV makes me feel good, sorta calms me and stop thinking about things.<br>  Lostprophets get me all hyper. <br>  Hinder's sad songs helps me cry.|`|372458a63fdf2cfd5035da966e6ddf39aa	Take a walk, maybe jog if I'm feeling energetic. Preferably while listening to Tripping Daisy, most of their songs let me forget about everyday stresses.<br>  <br>  MQ: Trip Along - Tripping Daisy|`|TasgpvcZaa	Hmmmm Music. Or Poetry :]<br>  MQ: Snuff-Slipknot.|`|tgfElCAEaa	I think it makes sense. May not to some people, but it definitely does to me...<br>  <br>  I like to read books and write, that always makes me feel better, and I forget about everything that's going on around me. I enter a new world and tune out earth.<br>  MQ: Christian Rock songs like 'Whatever You're Doing' and 'Call My Name'

I think Dakota Fanning will be the voice of Coraline, and it's going to be released in 2009. I think it's going to be pretty cool. :] hope this helps.|`|KCEZVHgDaa	i believe he is.

9531a5e374db145835852e9715fc4e49aa	The short answer to your question is, no.  You don't get quality for free.  But there are some things you can do.  There are free recording softwares out there.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://audacity.sourceforge.net/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Audio/Audio-Editors-Recorders/Cool-Edit-Pro.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/...</a><br>  <br>  This is only software to record tracks and do some basic editing, but the quality will still remain low, unless you get an Audio Interface.  Plugging your mic into your computer soundcard doesn't have the quality to produce good recordings.  It works though, and you'd still be able to get your songs on MySpace.  <br>  <br>  But in order to get a good recording, you need to bump up the quality of the Input.  That means you'd have to purchase an Audio Interface, which ranges from $100-endless.  Here's some examples of Audio Interfaces.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Audio/Audio-Editors-Recorders/Cool-Edit-Pro.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/...</a><br>  M-Audio Fast Track $99.99<br>  <br>  What Audio Interfaces do is converts your audio signal (mic, guitar, etc.) to a digital signal with a 24 bit / 48kHz converter.  This is what makes the qualtiy.  Unfortunately this $99 purchase only gets you the Hardward and doesn't provide any software.  You'd have to use one of the free softwares above or buy Cubase, Garage Band, etc.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/Lambda/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/L...</a><br>  Lexicon Lamabada at $149.99.  Here you spend a little money and get Cubase LE as well as the Hardware that allows you to plug in your instruments.

w5Y7aJYFaa	i personally didn't care for it.<br>  but it was very successful in that it seemed so real. <br>  it seemed like someone really found that camera and played the tape on screen.<br>  and that's totally different than most all films. <br>  which also gave it some of it's fame. <br>  <br>  not to mention, they made it with 40 thousand dollars and it made more than 140 million which is quite amazing indeed.<br>  it was a great film in that it was so successful but it was not my cup of tee.  |`|AA10065077	I didn't like the movie. I just made it a point to see the movie because of the marketing. The movie was originally being billed as a real documentary of collage students that disappeared while working on this documentary.

It was a real bummer when I found out that it was just marketing. |`|cbf96f599f38ac3cf8fc78df0a247bf5aa	I didn't care much for the movie as a whole, but the end wasn't bad with the guy ? gal ? in corner waiting while the other was killed like the legend said.

If so and he wins the next HoH he should evict Jam and go to the finals with Dick where he is almost guaranteed 1st place. <br>  <br>  If D or D win PoV, Jam goes and Zach hopes he wins HoH where he does the above. <br>  <br>  He told Dani he has thrown so many competitions so if that is true, this could happen.

Hvuqv6duaa	I think you mean away from the sun..anyway;<br>  <br>  The singer said the intro to this song was basically that this song was written at a time in the lead singers life when he didn't really know where to look, he had all of things that were so great, but he still felt his life lacked direction and he kept trying to focus on having more until he finally snapped out of it and realize that if you live your life trying to always get more and you never take a second to appreciate what you have then you are never going to be at peace and it is going to be a very depressing life. He didn't say outright that God was what brought him peace, but he did say that this song was written about the time in his life before he found that inner peace.

p7TSMfr9aa	Interesting question. Both are often mentioned more because of their respective looks and controversies than the fact that they both have actual talent.<br>  <br>  If I'm feeling like a movie, I'm going to choose Monroe. If I'm feeling like some angry music, I'm going for Manson. If I'm looking to be used by a Democratic family, I'm looking for a jar of pills.|`|ssoZ33XIaa	Marilyn Monroe for certain.  She is one of my favorite actresses, whereas I have never been a fan of Marilyn Manson.  Some Like it Hot is one of my all-time favorite movies.|`|yjSGVfdiaa	Monroe - surprisingly great comedienne and actress.  Also much more intelligent than the dumb act she put on for the cameras.  (great marketing on her part).  A strong, intelligent, sexy, curvy, blond.  I'm gonna go with her. <br>  <br>  Manson is painfully overrated.<br>  <br>  P.S.

She also stuffed her face with food and broke her food restriction. She got a penalty vote against her for doing that. She got evicted with a vote of 6-0. <br>  They also showed a little piece of Amber and Danielle's trip to new york. Nick was there to cheer Danielle on & Amber had a cousin there. They didn't show how they did on the Power of 10. If you want to check them out on that show it will be shown on Tuesday.<br>  At the HOH competition, Jessica won for the 2nd time.

49419b2f7186532df964083f73f810bcaa	Ciao!!<br>  Quanto hanno cambiato la mia vita???? Ero una fanatica dei "TRACOBETTI" di Data, adoravo lo spagnolo di Mouth per nn parlare di come Chuck si ingozzasse di panna spray per alleviare le sue pene (lui in questo mi è stato maestro)!!<br>  Quel film è un mio cult, lo vedo ogni volta che lo trasmettono pur avendo anche il dvd!!<br>  Mi sembrava di aver letto di Slot ma credimi sono felicissima di sapere che ci sarà un sequel anche se nn sarà mai bello come il primo!!<br>  <br>  Ciao|`|BPevsYVeaa	Ho odiato i Goonies dal profondo del mio cuore.<br>  E l'odio era direttamente proporzionale all'amore che aveva mia sorella per questo film, tanto da giralo in continuazione (aahhh, i primi esperimenti col videoregistratore), e crearne uno -squallidissimo e improbabile- adattamento teatrale.|`|VQKtvcGiaa	Bellissimo film!!! Io purtroppo son nato nell'89 e quindi non l'ho proprio vissuto quel film, ma è molto bello!!! Sai che l'attore che interpretava Sloth era un ex giocatore di Football NFL? La prima scelta assoluta al draft NFL del 1973!!!<br>  Ed ha anche vinto 2 Suprbowl!!!|`|ve1GhDHjaa	Guarda grazie infinite x questa domanda!<br>  <br>  Insieme a Frankenstein junior è il film che ha segnato la mia infanzia, questo tuo tributo quasi mi commuove!<br>  <br>  L'ho rivisto un mesetto fa insieme a mia nipote di 6 anni, io da piccola lo vedevo sempre con mio fratello (suo padre!) che in pratica mi ha cresciuta. E' stato fantastico vederla esaltata ed emozionata come lo ero io alla sua età!<br>  Davvero film così non li fanno più :(<br>  <br>  Se permetti ti aggiungo ai miei contatti...!|`|1CFqky2Iaa	io credo dia verlo già visto che slot era già morto, non saprei, ma credo avessi più di 6 anni quando l'ho visto, la mia vita non l'ha cambiata abbastanza perchè non stavo in campagna e le mie avventure in bici giravano intorno a qualche bravata da teppistello, ai chiodi al catechismo, alle finestre rotte col pallone scappando...mi è mancata la casa abbandonata...|`|b2d7b40ed8be1c8e59a4b1e31f5d49a4aa	Veramente sono rimasta più sconvolta quando ho saputo che quel figone di Mickey da grande si è imbruttito da morire! (Vedi "Il Signore degli Anelli").<br>  Che è in preparazione il numero 2 mi rende molto felice, speriamo che si riesca a mantenere il sapore avventuroso e sognante del primo!<br>  Non è un film che mi ha cambiato la vita, ma sicuramente ha allietato molti miei pomeriggi!|`|f32U2Eytaa	oh mamma mia, tantissimo!<br>  se passa in tv non resisto ancora adesso dal guardarlo!<br>  come mi piaceva!|`|fV9tfs6Haa	Io non ero proprio bambina, avevo da poco smesso di esserlo, senza ancora diventare qualcos'altro, avevo quattordici anni e lo vidi al cinema con una mia carissima amica che ogni tanto ho ancora la fortuna di vedere, anche se troppo di rado.<br>  Mi fece sentire la nostalgia della fanciullezza, anche se ne avevo ancora addosso l'odore e le sensazioni, ho avuto la fortuna di essere una bimba libera e un po' randagia, con le corse nei campi, con i giochi con gli amici, con le scaramucce coi meno amici. Erano tempi in cui un bambino poteva uscire di casa dopo pranzo e ritornare prima di cena, e le mamme potevano stare relativamente tranquille. I nostri figli non possono godere di questo enorme privilegio. Anche io, a modo mio, ho vissuto avventure, ho affrontato paure, ho sognato amori e sono cresciuta, ma qualcosa della bambina resta sempre, così anche io guardo sempre quel film quando lo ripropongono.<br>  Grazie per la carrellata di ricordi che ha tirato fuori la domanda.|`|faf5ebbb956a1bfe8624a427541a90f3aa	io non ero ancora nata nel 1985...<br>  ma quel film da piccolina l'avrò visto un milione di volte!<br>  troppo bello!<br>  non posso crederci che spielberg stia facendo il 2!<br>  andrò sicuramente a vederlo al cinema!<br>  <br>  comunque questo film mi ha regalato delle emozioni bellissime, ogni volta che lo rivedevo era come se fosse la prima!|`|hMbSFV6Iaa	io amavo Data,con le sue mille invenzioni pazze...e poi sean astin k è finito a fare sam nel signore degli anelli...c ho messo un bel pò x riconoscerlo...troppo bello,l'avrò visto più d 100volte!!|`|lK1raL3Qaa	Tanto da farmi uscire pazzo per le canzoni di Cyndi Lauper|`|pAkzG6Fgaa	Io so il film a memoria.

Proiettili veri! ...O cacchio!"<br>  e potrei andare avanti, ogni battuta è un cult.|`|DLgtvXSmaa	Il film è stupendo ha cambiato la mia vita positivamente me lo ricordo benissimo il film ma ogni volta che passa in tv lo guardo ancora anche se c'è lho in DVD <br>  <br>  Adoro anche il film Stand by me (1986)|`|U3dpmiocaa	Fichissimiiiiiiii!!! <br>  Io ero innamorata di Mikey ^^ e quando si era baciato con la ragazza del fratello nella grotta volevo essere lei!<br>  <br>  Qualche anno fa mi sono comprata anche il dvd originale e ogni tanto mi capita di rivederlo, per me è sempre un piacere rivedere i film della nostra generazione... quelli di ora, e parlo anche dei cartoni animati, sono veramente scandalosi!<br>  <br>  Chi, della nostra generazione, ogni tanto non se ne esce fuori con i strafalcioni di Data???  Traccobetto anzichè trabocchetto è un cult!!! ^^<br>  <br>  Per non parlare di Chunk quando racconta alla banda Fratelli tutta la sua vita... da sganasciarsi dalle risate!<br>  <br>  E Slot, il Superman della situazione, un Eroe... mi spiace sia morto! :(<br>  <br>  Alla fine credo che infondo infondo siamo tutti un pò Goonies (a me sarebbe piaciuto far parte del loro gruppo ^^)|`|llpBmcofaa	bellissimo.. sloooot gelatooo!!!|`|o0UbjnLZaa	io ho adorato quel film dall'inizio! il mio preferito era data e i suoi tracobbetti...hahaha e poi anche Brandon...il fratello figo di Mickey, woooooooow  io sono cresciuta coi Goonies e non ci sia mese che non mi metta a guardarlo un pomeriggio erivedermi tutte le scene migliori...praticamente tutto il film.. =) =)|`|uEhmwzH7aa	io non ero ancora nata nel 1985..ma l'avrò visto senza scherzare almeno 30 volte!!è adorabile!! lo so a memoria..e la storia è proprio bella..tanto che ricordo che da piccola io e i miei amici facevamo finta di essere i "goonies" e andavamo in giro alla ricerca del tesoro di WIlly l'Orbo!! <br>  poi Sean Astin (Micky)il sam del signore degli anelli.. è stupendo da piccolo...!! per non parlare di Mouth e di Chunk..con il parrucchino dello zio e la miscela di vomito al cinema!! :-) è un film che non ha età...lo consiglio a tutti!!|`|zvnry993aa	bhe' io l'ho visto un po' di anni dopo ma adoro "i goonies"!!!!!<br>  l'ho visto centinaia di volte!!!...ormai so tutto a memoria..<br>  come si fa a dimenticare i "tracobetti"..."se non lo fai giusto diventiamo bemolli noi"..."gli strumenti di tortura del signor e dalla signora Wallsh"...ecc...<br>  penso che abbiano contribuito tantissimo a come sono ora....<br>  qst attori sono diventati i miei idoli da bambina...=)<br>  <br>  Maty anche a me piace tntissimo "stand by me"...|`|Pxykg5F5aa	guarda ho premiato una mia domanda con una risposta che citava proprio i Goonies avevo 11 anni e li adoravo!! ero innamorata persa di Brent il fratello di Mickey e ammetto che anche ora mi piace vederlo ogni tanto, mi fa stare bene!!

a4s0zxotaa	okay, so i took a whack at it :D<br>  you need something divisible by 4 and divisible by 3 with one left over. <br>  so i think it would be 16 pencils with 5 jars because the pencils go evenly into the jars and if you put 3 in each, 3X5=15, with one left over :D<br>  hope that helped.<br>  ish. <br>  (:|`|6RxvrJlUaa	You would have 16 pencils and 5 jars. <br>  4 pencils in each jar will leave one jar left over. 4jars with 4 pencils in each, 16 pencils, 1 jar left over.<br>  3 pencils in each jar will have 1 pencil left over. 3x5=15, 16 pencils.|`|gr14Qzx9aa	You have 5 jars and 16 pencils. <br>  <br>  if you put 4 pencils into each jar, the fifth jar will not have any, and if you put three into each, there will be one left over. |`|fUohbDoeaa	16 pencils and 5 jars|`|BrhTBnO1aa	theres 16 pencils and 5 jars|`|WerF86bUaa	5 jars and 16 pencils....if u want solution plz ask me.|`|aXYiOskmaa	5 jars, 16 pencils?|`|84H5kMD7aa	5 jars, 16 pencils|`|cnOr4hpWaa	This can be solved using two algebra equations.  <br>  <br>  j = (p / 4) + 1 --> because the number of jars equals however many pencils you have, divided into four groups, plus 1.<br>  <br>  p = 3j + 1 --> because the number of pencils you have equals however many jars you have, times 3, plus one.  This equation can also be written as j = (p - 1) / 3 (so it makes it easier for us to solve for "j")<br>  <br>  Next, set the two equations equal to each other (plug in one of the equations for "j"):<br>  <br>  (p / 4) + 1 = (p - 1) / 3<br>  <br>  And when you solve for "p" you get 16.  Now plug 16 into either one of the first equations and solve for "j", example:<br>  <br>  16 = 3j + 1<br>  <br>  You will get j = 5...<br>  <br>  Thus!  We have 16 pencils and 5 jars.  Hope this helps!!|`|ZlNrjo9Daa	4(j-1) = 3j + 1<br>  4j - 4 = 3j + 1<br>  j = 5<br>  5 Jars<br>  4(5-1) = 16 penciles|`|wvhyTrYPaa	16 pencils and 5 jars|`|6rog8sv2aa	wow that was hard but the answer is    :     5 jars   16 pencils

sEFXXfn4aa	pues cada banda tiene algo q la hace diferente aunq sean del mismo genero.korn tiene muy buenas canciones y fueron los pioneros, ayudaron a limp bizkit a salir adelante, y los bizkits llevaron el genero a lo mas alto, no por nada tienen el record de ventas de un album de rock junto con los legendarios beatles y linkin park siguio impulsando el genero. en lo personal me gusta mas limp bizkit por su variedad desde canciones con sonidos crudos, hip hop, canciones melodicas, canciones q no dicen nada y canciones con buen mensaje. mis favoritas LB=Nookie, Korn=Blind, LP=In the End|`|02845f97375633c1e757556832c2d905aa	Por supuesto que Korn -Thoughtless, me encanta|`|Cxfgvpriaa	pues linkin park son de lo mejor|`|YYmZxT6Waa	Ninguna, todas son horribles|`|oqmoh9mpaa	ulap!!!!! <br>   pues a mi me parece que korn es una banda super y linkin park tambien las dos estan bien <br>   xaaauuuuuu|`|4d7e8a58d348d7478b5e6e8100b26c19aa	Las dos son asquerosas.|`|5b7Y8M4naa	Linkin Park.<br>  <br>  In the end<br>  <br>  <br>  salu2|`|4vzMfN3uaa	PARA MI KORN, Y LAS ROLAS K MAS ME LATEN.

u0ljcg7jaa	I'm not rich, and I collect coins.... Does that mean I'm "strange"?<br>  <br>  I guess they see them as strange because in the eyes of others they see them as poor and why are they collecting when they maybe can't afford it... That's they only thing I can think of, people ask me all the time, why I collect coins. I found one that is worth over $3200.00 :)|`|AA11550042	I think it like this, rich people have and always get special treatment because  hey most people let money rule them and money buys power in some situations, I think society just place these things on people anyway, whats important is what you feel and think.|`|frjSBxzBaa	I always thought when you are poor you are just considered crazy not strange |`|v3CZx9Cxaa	Cuz rich people are the only ones allowed to use fancy words.|`|AA10998789	It's strange no matter what.

jjh1DDftaa	On June 24, 2003, the decision was mine to make as to whether or not my mother continued on life support.<br>  Before she was hospitalized, she had made her wishes clear in a way that I could understand without a doubt.  She had emphysema and only 17% total lung function. If she had to be intubated (spelling?) again, it was unlikely she would come off without the use of breathing machines for the remainder of her life. She told me if she couldn't live without the aide of those machines, she didn't want to live. I quote her when I say "I don't want to be Superman. That's not how I want my children and my Joey to remember me" ("my Joey" is my son)<br>  It was a sucky decision to make, but it was easy.  I asked her doctor what he thought her chances were to go on without machines and he said, "I'm sorry." so I told him to let her go.<br>  The decision sometimes really isn't on the shoulders of the person who has the "say so" Often it was made in advance by the person who no longer has the voice or the option of vocalizing it.|`|vtF8YAjyaa	i dont think i could take another life.even if they were suffering.<br>  the way i look at things is im a christian and i believe christ died and suffered for us ,so i believe we all have to suffer in this life also.who are we to complain about this temparary pain .we all must suffer in different ways.some of us suffer with our heath ,some with poverty, some with loneliness,some with mental illness.so in reality could we all be put out of our misery for our sufferings no matter what they are?....no we cant Gods work is not done with us ,we have to wait for his hand..<br>  i also dont believe we should be kept alive artificially either<br>  i dont think thats meant to be.i have a D.N.R order when i die.|`|Py7Rf3D8aa	I probably would. If they want to end their suffering, ultimately it's their choice. Yeah, I would be really sad about it, but I wouldn't want to put them through anymore pain just for my benefit.|`|8lME2HFraa	Not everyone, but yes I could if they asked me to.<br>  I would hate it, but i would do as they asked.|`|ed660bc6d834adbd270304b7f1c2611faa	Yes, I could. It would be hard as heck, but I believe that if a person is suffering and have little to no chance of recovery, why prolong the inevitable? If the person was meant to live, they would do so with out the aid of a machine. I have a living will and in it I give myself a 14 day trial of life (if I have less that 20% chance of recovery) anything higher I have opted for machine support. But, after 14 days I am to be sedated and allowed to die a peaceful death. I think that if God wants me to die, he will take me and that is no one elses choice but his to make.|`|QssGgUVRaa	I had that very decision to make when my wife aged 36yrs fell very ill.  She was on a life support machine for 2.5 mths and after 13 operations.  She just got worse as time went on.<br>  The consultant said to me that i should give them authority to turn off the machine and let her pass with dignity.<br>  I could not do it, i felt that if she was trying to  fight the illness as i knew she was, then  i had to give her every possible chance, i would not have lived with myself if i had given them the go ahead, it would have felt like i had killed her.<br>  I am widowed with three young girls.<br>  <br>  Give them EVERY chance possible!|`|KC4hUPeNaa	Honestly - I would. It would be the hardest thing I'd ever have to do. However I think it should be up to the person on life support whether they want to live or die. Do you know what I mean?|`|gv3YhRj7aa	Yes and I had to do it already.Its not easy to live with but the suffering from lung cancer is unbearable to and with no hope I had to follow her wishes|`|dlzQFHgBaa	I believe very firmly that I could.  I know that is what I want if I were ever in the same situation.  I hope you have found peace with your decision.|`|gEwnV2flaa	Let God do it.It's part of his job.|`|4p9CalxUaa	because i love them and do not want them to suffer so yes i would|`|XimNzyjnaa	yes cause i wouldn't wont too see them suffer................|`|FhKfyxWlaa	I have, and I would do it again.|`|e0dfa3fdc942811839c7d92bf458b1f5aa	Of course. Staying alive with a machine always keeping you going is not really living. You are dependent on a single mechanical device keeping you going.<br>  <br>  Death before becoming a vegetable. I promised my friends this, and I will not let them down.

I get more annoyed at a person who says'"Geez ! You look fat!" especially when I worked my butt off to lose 5 pounds. Now that is annoying!|`|7d5ec5e53039b237fbb5c9d8ffa0e9f3aa	I agree! What I usually say is "Are you saying I'm ugly??" Lol works every time|`|ZkR1Y2fTaa	no i totally agree. when people say that kind of stuff its like "gee thanks you too?" honestly what are you supposed to say? and only really awkward people ask..very strange|`|QWr0mocnaa	tired? no i don't get annoyed. i get more comments on how i look dead - now THAT's annoying!!|`|OR0xrlfiaa	YES very annoying, especially because not only do they tell me I look tired, but they feel the need to ask me if ive been smoking lately again.<br>  Like Friday,I was super tired, and 5 ppl asked me if I was high, cause i looked like it.<br>  But I was just reeeaallly tired, that was all.<br>  I hate it so much, your not alone.|`|lp2GsQGbaa	no, i do not find it annoying!!! if i am looking tired, then i am looking tired!!! i cannot do anything about it!!! at least, people will know that i have truly worked the entire day and that is the reason why i am looking tired!!! it is better to look tired at the end of a working day than to look " fresh as a daisy " !!! i am not saying that one should look like " a hag " or like " what the cat dragged in " , but you should look reasonably tired after a day's work!!!|`|ttn1O6u2aa	yea, annoying.<br>  jokingly -> ok|`|459MOxHfaa	Only vain people think that way. |`|3c7f5e7e45aa92340f7a218ac50c04ceaa	for me, I don't as I will take all that as a concern from my colleagues.|`|C6ZJcNJjaa	It doesn't bother me because it's usually true and I can use it to my advantage and get out of stuff I don't want to do.  Meg<br>  <br>  My reply:  Yeah, and I didn't shower either so I look like crap and I smell.  Enjoy.   Neen|`|9dtrWO5laa	no, I absolutely hate when people say that to me. especially at work because you already feel like crap just being there and to have someone say "you look tired" really gets me irritated. I feel like they are telling me you look bad you need more sleep. lol|`|AA10413046	Nope, you are not being too sensitive about this.  Some people are just RUDE!  It's like when someone says you've gained weight; like you don't own a freaking mirror.|`|Onh6soTEaa	Your avatar even looks tired|`|fr8PqRxuaa	I know what you mean.

6ad9d51cf0eb3915d774ed293ef5d282aa	its true, those songs were released at the acoustic macbeth studio show, atom played the songs from his ipod over a speaker to the crowd.

3cb69f2b9e2a1ff4b968961abd64145daa	In my opinion i love simple plan because they are great rolemodels..they can write about how you feel and they dont let ANYTHING bring them down, especially HATERS...as long as they have fans they will never stop playing..they are more mature now..if you look at the lyrics of Save You , you will tear up, they arent singing about kid stuff anymore, they are singing about love,sadness,betrayal,and hatred. i will ALWAYS support them no matter what because they change people`s lives...<br>  They are awesome to their fans also..<br>  <br>  SP rocks!<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S: to all you haters:<br>  They wrote "im just a kid" when they were teenagers, and so what if they still sing their old songs? we fans love it!|`|82946bac5a72f2b8fbcdafb97f625641aa	Well, they are whiney dudes singing about how bad they had it as kids - grow up!|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	Horrible vocals.

I listen to Led Zeppelin, Rush, Metallica because I respect them and their music. <br>  <br>  The difference between emo music and real rock is as follows:<br>  <br>  emo bands whine and complain about how life is so hard being teens (and these guys are in their mid twenties, some in there thirties.  Time to grow up guys)  emo bands don't play their instruments that well.  Their lyrics aren't well written.

It's been aired for 56 years. Sesame street 39 years, there's alot of shows running longer than the simpsons. I always thought "Boy Meets World" was the longest because it was when the kids were like 12 to their 20's. Boy was I wrong, I still love the show though.

oq772RzVaa	Oh my gosh it was amazing. It starts out with this Chinese girl trying to find her biological parents in china and she ends up as houses patient. However, House's dad died in this episode and his mom is continually calling him. Cuddy convinces house that he needs this shot to protect himself from the "virus" the patient has. She ends up drugging him since he refused to go to the funeral. He wakes up and is in Wilson's car. Alot of things happen along the way and eventually they get arrested well Wilson does but House does to I think for being with a felon. you find out how Wilson and house met. House bailed Wilson out of jail that's how they met. So the cop lets them go cause he wants house to go to the funeral. Once in the car he reveals to Wilson that his dad that died isn't his real dad. He has known this since he was 12. At the funeral House's mom wants him to deliver a eulogy. He does and starts insulting his father but then almost cries. However, you see this is an act because when he goes to kiss his fathers forehead he takes a piece of skin for a genetics test. Wilson figures this out and they start yelling at each other in another room. Ironically Wilson got thrown in jail in his earlier years for breaking an antique mirror. And once he gets so angry at house he takes a bottle of booze and throws it and breaks an antique stained glass window. in the end the girl who they were trying to diagnose met her real parents but they had tried to kill her because of the 1 child law in china. She just needed surgury to get the needles out of her head that they but in there when she was a child.

Cuddy drugged House and Wilson drove House to the funeral unwillingly.  House tried to do anything and everything he could to get out of going ..by knocking the keys out of Wilson's hand into the gutter to getting pulled over by the cops and eventually arrested (due to a incident in college that was never resolved) but the cops eventually let them go and they finally get to the funeral and House makes a some what eulogy and cut his father to get a piece of his DNA  to prove that he wasn't his father..(House had a feeling since he was 12) and at the end we find out he really wasn't his father and that Wilson decides he is getting his old job back and Princeton Plainsboro 
VxAWa9OIaa	Alright, so this is from memory.<br>  <br>  Some guy is like blacking out or something (missing long periods of time) and he and his daughter are kinda weird.  They get sent to the hospital.  Cuddy gets to meet the mother of the baby she's adopting, but sees the mother has an odd rash on her arm and emits her to the hospital.  House is constantly trying to convince Cuddy that she doesn't want the baby and it starts to make her mad, but also makes her think.<br>  They figure out the the man and his daughter have something that gives them the symptoms of, feeling no emotion, basicly sleepwalking, and sweating blood.  <br>  The mother of Cuddys soon to be baby is having problems, and they have to give birth early.  The baby is born and named Joy.  Cuddy is very happy to have her.  <br>  House figures out how to heal the father and his daughter, and they become themsleves (finally able to be happy)<br>  The mother of the baby sees how happy cuddy was, and takes the baby back.  Leaving cuddy heartbroken.<br>  She's crying in the empty babies nursery, when house walks in.  he tells her she would have been a great mother, and she gets mad that he always says the opposite of what she does (she was giving up and saying she's not ment to be a mother.)  She asks him why he always negates what she says, and he just stares at her, says I don't know...and then starts kissing her.  She kisses him back...then they stop, and he says goodnight, and leaves....<br>  <br>  TADA! :)<br>  Sorry, I care more about Cuddy and House than the actually patients. so yeahh! :)<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  The last 5 minutes were amazing...<br>  But I'm a lover of huddy as well! haha.  :)|`|tWWT9Wq5aa	it was an amazing episode. whenever you have time you just have to watch it, or atleast the last like 5 minutes of it. .

Thirteen brings her to Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital where House and the team take the case. House finds the situation a good opportunity to delve into her personal life, and he goes to search Thirteen's apartment with Foreman. Thirteen suspects that the woman's illness is related to her drug use, but she then finds out that the woman has a long medical history and has seen several doctors over the past few years, along with the fact that she only slept with Thirteen to get to House, who wouldn't accept her as a patient. Foreman confronts Thirteen about her current lifestyle, warning her that it is sending her life and job into a downward spiral. After Cuddy suspects Thirteen doing drugs, House fires her.

After famous astronaut Marga Janssen's corpse is found afloat in the waters of Battery Park, Detectives Elliot Stabler and Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) initially believe the murder is linked to a string of serial rapes. Upon further investigation, this theory is proven false when their suspect's alibi checks out. At a dead end, Detective Stabler turns to his old mentor and former colleague of Janssen's, NASA astronaut Dick Finley to shed some light on the case. Finley's advice exposes several more suspects, but possibly takes the detectives further from the truth.

Hck22n9Faa	The Bends. <br>  - I really like the guitar work that Jonny demostrates in this album. Every song is fantastic. A amazing album overall. To me its oerfect, you great every aspect that you'd want from an album. It shows has shown their growth from Pablo Honey. |`|64qRgtrBaa	I'm not a diehard Radiohead fan, but I own everything they did from '95-'03. I think I still like "The Bends" the most, it was a very solid album from start to finish and almost every song on there got radio-play. But right beind that, I like "Kid A." It's completely different than "The Bends" but it's just so creepy and weird, great stuff! It actually managed to be innovative in a time where it seemed like everything had been done.|`|AA10795350	It's a hard choice seeing as Radiohead is my favorite band and every Radiohead album and EP is special to me. But:<br>  <br>  In Rainbows.<br>  <br>  Ten distinct, engaging songs. Perfect flow and an 'epic' feeling. From the urgent opening of "15 Step" to the melancholy final notes of "Videotape," it's pure Radiohead -- atmospheric, emotional, perceptive, etc. |`|AA12358335	The Bends. It's actually in my Top 5 of all-time favorite albums. <br>  <br>  It's hard to choose one, because their entire discography has such a different, ever-evolving sound to it, but there's something about The Bends that just feels timeless to me. <br>  <br>  If I had to sum up in two words why I love The Bends, it'd be this: Black Star. Three more words, you say? Okay. My Iron Lung. <br>  |`|AA11230418	Ok computer 1st favorite<br>  The Bends 2nd favorite<br>  In Rainbows 3rd favorite|`|Vtv3wPVXaa	Defo the bends...reminds me of when i was younger n just started listening to music. dont even compare radiohead to oasis....that would be wrong|`|HIIgE0Euaa	Pablo Honey or The Bends<br>  <br>  Their older stuff is my fave.  <br>  <br>  Fave song is Creep and The Bends has nary a dull moment.|`|BB7d8EqBaa	OK Computer.

It's perfect from start to finish. I especially love "Black Star" :)|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	The Bends because it has a great variety of songs and one's which will always stand the test of time. That was Radiohead at their very best and funny enough I can see them reaching their peak again in the next few years. Thom Yorke is a serious songwriter and for me they leave Oasis for dust.|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	Oh man, it's tough. I always seem to use the stock answer of OK Computer because of just how crazy that record it is. How much it influenced alt rock moving forward. The fact that really, OK Computer is a work of art (not to sound too pretentious, but there are few records that really stand out as works of art, where the record isn't just a collection of songs, but the record itself is a standing piece). OK Computer is a ride, an experience, and I love that about it.<br>  <br>  That said, I would 100% say it's "their best" record, though there is some real competition from Kid A particularly, but my favorite is an ever rotating position. I am very fickle and on any given day it could be the Bends, OK Computer, Kid A, or Hail to the Thief. If it counts, I've believed a time or two that Airbag may be their strongest collection of songs (if it had been produced to the level of their other records, and maybe had one or two more songs I wonder where it would fit in the sort of Radiohead heirarchy).|`|0cc7b69ea6b5f359aa006de2a67d9086aa	OK Computer for its' wry smile.

AA11610276	I like both...but Teen Nick, I must say, is better than Disney Channel shows. <br>  <br>  Sorry to those who prefer Disney Channel. I don't mean to offend, but I think that Teen Nick is something I can relate to a little bit more. <br>  <br>  Can you relate to Hannah Montana? Living a secret life as a celebrity and a regular teen? I highly doubt anyone lives like that. However, on shows like iCarly, Zoey 101, and Drake & Josh, some of those events have actually happened to me, so I can relate to it better. |`|Sb0h7g5Iaa	If I had to choose when shows like "That's So Raven" and "Lizzie McGuire", etc were still airing, then I would say Disney Channel.<br>  But if you're asking now, I'd still choose Disney Channel. Don't get me wrong though, I love Drake and Josh! But sadly, it's gone and it's replaced by ICrappy (Carly, sorry I despise that show). Zoey101 is pretty cool. I agree with you though. I still like Disney more, I just don't like the Hannah Montana crap.<br>  But I'll admit that Nick has better cartoons then Disney Channel as of right now.|`|8hGE1siBaa	Disney of course... man they have sexual subliminal messages in their shows... and the disney princesses makes a great hentai materials...|`|T8YURmkgaa	i like nick and all but disney world is FUN|`|M43M4KZxaa	i'm not talking about one picture here but disney as a whole way back into 60's.of course when we talked of disney mickey and the gang (donald,goofy,daisy,minnie and pluto)comes to mind.but disney are also known for their animated movies like pinocchio,cinderela,snow white and many more.they are considered classics.movies like mary poppins,parent trap,herbie and others are also a collection and has done modern versions.the only animated picture nominated in the best picture category was beauty and the beast also by disney.but then again kids today are hooked into nick.my nieces like nickjr and i also enjoy watching them.but they also have a collection of disney cartoons.maybe i have a disney child that's in me.that's why till now it's still disney!|`|P4nJTCNbaa	i like disney:<br>  1.) great role models, besides miley cyrus<br>  2.) funny<br>  3.) started by the man himself, Walt Disney<br>  4.) not stupid like spongebob or something<br>  5.) a lot of stars make it on the big screen from disney

zf559rY3aa	There are a lot of similar bands. I would check out Saosin.<br>  <br>  Honestly, the best way to find out new bands that are similar to artists you like is to go to Pandora radio. Pandora.com.<br>  <br>  Its a radio station that you make based on what you already like... for instance, if you go and type in "red jumpsuit apparatus", it will play songs by bands that sound like them. I love it, and it has helped me find some really good new bands.|`|9l8Z6XEcaa	There are lots of bands similar to The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus...<br>  <br>  Here are a list of bands which i think is similar to RJA based on the sound and concepts of their music.<br>  <br>  -Linkin Park<br>  -Boys Like Girls<br>  -All American Rejects<br>  -Dashboard Confessional<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|98d9db4d2e5e9f2e1230126103949479aa	I think Lostprophets ,30 seconds to Mars ,3 Days Grace  |`|vuWPV81uaa	Here ya go mate<br>  <br>  30 Seconds to mars<br>  The Receiving End of Sirens<br>  The Black Maria<br>  Motion City Soundtrack (bit poppier, maybe to much so)<br>  Scary Kids Scaring Kids (maybe, i dont really like them :)<br>  Silverstein<br>  Taking Back Sunday<br>  <br>  Give some of them a go, your sure to find at least one band.

d38e40ad1357aba224b7db0686f987e8aa	Pirates<br>  <br>  While I completely understand the knee-jerk reaction of some people to immediately predict ninjas would be the winner, I have to respectfully disagree.  <br>  <br>  First, pirates are the sweetest warriors ever.  Maybe you think, okay a ninja will just sneak up on a pirate and chop his head off or reach in and pull his heart out, just like they would to any other normal person.  What you are forgetting is that  pirates live on boats, and ninjas will try to sneak and they will slip and fall when the boat rocks and be noticed.  A noticed ninja is no longer a ninja and a band of drunken pirates will wipe his *** all over the deck like he is any other all-black wearing goth homo.<br>  <br>  Second, even if a ninja did get his sea-legs by sneaking aboard in a  crate of rum and then practicing walking around in the hold while the pirates are passed out, they have parrots on their shoulders for a reason, and that's to look out for ninjas. So after being alerted to the stealthy, sea-legged ninja, the pirates would make shark food of him at once.<br>  <br>  qed|`|JHfRXpE4aa	I take Pirates. <br>  <br>  Arg mateys, let's tie these ninjas and throw them into davey jones' locker!<br>  Aye! Aye! Captain!<br>  <br>  They're just so cool with words.  So manly.  Ninjas are boring.  <br>  <br>  I love Pirates!|`|35e8b7f3439e3f019a56b773c13e6048aa	Ninjas.  The ninjas could kill the pirates without the pirates even knowing that the ninjas were in the room.  Ninjas, however, could sell the pirates coming from a mile away.|`|9iIlwJD5aa	Ninjas all the way because not only can they fight with swords, they do kung-fu. Pirates only say arrrgh and swordfight, they aren't stealthy and can't do kung-fu.|`|PLu8dyOFaa	ok dude now imagine a series of Naruto vs.pirates of the carribean !!whod youll think will win?|`|UsdnpHLwaa	NINJAS!|`|8yE2sYGeaa	Ninjas, as they are more stealthy|`|GC2ruUZdaa	On land, the Ninjas fare better than pirates. At sea, Ninjas wind up walking the plank.|`|AjcxPl7Uaa	Let us analyze.<br>  <br>  1. Pirates use sword, guns and daggers; Ninjas use ninjato, kunai, shuriken, kama, naginata, tetsu-bushi, etc. They could use guns too.<br>  2. Pirates are good in fist-fights and smashing bottles; Ninjas were expert in martial arts.<br>  3. Pirates use a boat in water, good swimmer; Ninjas can walk in water, stay underwater a lil bit longer, good swimmer and also use a boat.<br>  4. Pirates love to steal and terrorize; Ninjas love to terrorize and to assasinate.<br>  5. Pirates can walk on ropes and climb high poles; Ninja leap high, use illusion, walk on ropes, climb poles and even walls.<br>  <br>  I think the Ninja will win.<br>  <br>  A???<br>  |`|CaTjMpo3aa	ninjas are buddists<br>  pirates get booty.<br>  u decide but my vote is towards the ninjas|`|jcGtGNMDaa	Well Ninja.. mostly|`|XNzy6txkaa	ninja of course 
cd54cf33dbed81caad3ae282c38ac2f2aa	"I dropped by the Merlefest site (www.merlefest.org)last evening to take a look at their forum, which I try to follow and contribute to, and found a template for a new site to go live on August 31st. This struck me as a good idea, since they've had basically the same site for several years. No links on it are currently alive, but something did catch my attention.<br>  <br>  It appears, from the template, that they have decided to eliminate their Merlefest Forum, a place where about 2500 Merlefest fans have had a chance to exchange information, sell tickets they have purchased but find they cannot use, make recommendations for performers they'd like to see, and complain about Merlefest policies. <br>  <br>  Recently, there has been a thread running called "Sad News" which explored the removal and resignations of a pretty good number of Merlefest staff members and speculated on what this might mean for the future of this premier festival. Is it possible that the new management of Merlefest has such a thin skin and is so concerned about controversy that they have eliminated this very important internal communications device? At present the question is up in the air awaiting the debut of this new web site, but if you are a Merlefest adherent, you should keep an eye on this.               <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|sDTHFQ9baa	Why don't we start a yahoo discussion board for merlefest?

aa6e5856c840ca3ba7f330356b9c70f5aa	Virgo and Capricorn<br>  <br>  Capricorn is a superb lover for you, dear Virgo! Capricorn is an earth sign like yours, so you relate on an intuitive level because so many of your values are the same -- such as in your career goals. Capricorn rules the natural 10th house of the horoscope. The Goat is focused on climbing the ladder of success, and it is a rare Capricorn that doesn't reach the top of his or her profession. As a Virgo, you're a hard worker too, measuring your productivity level at the end of every day. Your sign has been called the sign of discrimination (you're known to be the universal critic) but the one you are hardest on is always yourself. Try not to let work overpower all the other areas of your life with Capricorn. You both are so duty-bound that you could forget your need for lighthearted fun (including time in the bedroom) because overwork could put a damper on your union. <br>  <br>  You agree on many things, such as how to spend and save money; a nest egg is very important to both of you. Social approval is also important -- neither of you wants to get kicked out of the country club nor the bowling league. Rather, you both want to find acceptance in the best possible circles so you can meet interesting, successful people and be inspired by them. This is particularly true of your lover; Capricorn works hard at networking with influential people. <br>  <br>  Neither of you would let the other down -- nor anyone else, for that matter -- and the one thing that gets you crazy is when someone is irresponsible. Life is busy, and when you cannot count on someone following through on a promise or a responsibility, it shatters your trust in that person. Virgos and Capricorns need to take people at face value. You both believe this so, happily, there will be no problem on this score. You both are practical, solid citizens with good common sense -- something you have found isn't so common anymore! <br>  <br>  Your lover is ruled by Saturn, and therefore is not very emotional on the outside. Still, because you are Mercury's child, you see beneath Capricorn's cover and understand his or her feelings clearly. Virgos always have clear, bright eyes that see through the veils of things like pride, shyness, or lack of confidence. Your lover will be deeply grateful for your understanding and your compassion. Your union will be a rich and mature one, based on mutual caring and a shared vision of the future. Being earth signs, you both will be willing to dig down to the buried treasures that lie within each other. You both also have serious outlooks on life, but your life together will not be boring or routine, because your goals are lofty and inspired. <br>  <br>  In bed, because Capricorn has established such trust in you, you will be free to express your deepest feelings. Be reassured: You will not be criticized or ridiculed. While other lovers may have found one of you too reserved or shy, you have none of these problems with one another. Both of you like to proceed slowly in the physical arena, so neither of you is likely to hop into bed impetuously -- certainly not until you know one another well. That careful, slow build-up of emotional intimacy is what will make your pairing so strong and sensual. Earth signs are deeply erotic once they feel love stirring within them, so let it happen at its own pace; the earth knows when it has reached critical mass. Once linked, neither of you will feel the need to go back to singles mixers nor search any further for a mate. Earth signs mate for life -- their loyalty is strong -- only the most extreme conditions could cause you to pull apart once joined. <br>  <br>  So let others complain that you both are too slow and careful making up your mind about whether to wed -- then laugh at them later, when you celebrate your 50th wedding anniversary with your Capricorn.|`|6IujWlx4aa	Yup!|`|AMWBeI62aa	yep... both earth signs. basically made for eachother.|`|X3ZCLBcIaa	Look at what planets are in your moon, venus and mars on both of your birthcharts. compatible signs in these aspects would be a better indicator of a relationship.|`|YnfrzqGDaa	[no] virgo and gemini good match.and capricorn and taurs.|`|ae59b9d2e568cc9a9cefee00f2390e69aa	generally, yes! both earth signs:>|`|qnBVKBJIaa	Yes|`|25ae99c346a7b83556af191dded8ed5daa	I think you would get bored.

AA10026103	TorrentSpy is a Torrent indexing website. That means that you can go there and get "torrents" which are opened in special applications, where they download download files. You can get movies, music, TV show episodes, computer games and programs, etc. for free. Downloading is usually (but not always, depending on the copyright status of what you are downloading) illegal (copyright infringement), but few are caught because everything is done in the privacy of your own home. Newer movies (still in theaters) are often low quality because they are taped on home video recorders. Movies that are out on DVD already are often perfect quality, however.<br>  <br>  Other websites similar to torrentspy are isohunt and demonoid. <br>  <br>  The application you need you can find for free online. I recommend uTorrent or Azureus. Or if you have an Apple Computer, get a program called Transmission.|`|XowFwU9Oaa	torrent spy is awesome i use it all the time to download movies

Go listen to them. Good Trance.<br>  <br>  Go find Digitalism and I'd suggest to start with their song "Jupiter Room (Martian Assult Mix)" and see if you like that.<br>  <br>  Look for Robbie Rivera. Especially for his song, "Float away".<br>  <br>  Carl Cox (50,000 Watts is my fav. ;)).<br>  <br>  DJ Dan..try him out.<br>  <br>  Fatboy Slim. Period.

Look for his song, Exceeder.<br>  <br>  David Guetta.<br>  <br>  Telepopmusik<br>  <br>  Felix Da Housecat, "Silver Screen (Shower scene)".<br>  <br>  Michael Gray, "Borderline (Vocal Club Mix)".<br>  <br>  Green Velvet "La la land".<br>  <br>  Annd, well, I have plenty more artists and such to give out but it's up for you to explore really what you like personally and don't like..lol..but if you want me to bring out an more that I know of seeming to sound pretty awsome you could give me a message orrrr something in that mix.

f9cb74146809bdff65cd7f638cce6dfeaa	well Squier is made by Fender. Most Squiers play just as well as Fenders costing 5 times as much. The hardware is cheaper (i.e. bridge, pickups, tuners), as well as the paint job. They will perform just fine. Some guitar players won't be caught dead playing a Squier, which is just stupid. Buy a Squier with an Alder or Ash body and you can always upgrade the hardware if you want, but it will be all you need. You might need someone to set it up for you. Have fun!|`|zDBGLp3vaa	I personally prefer Fender, but I am not very objective about that.  I am a cousin of Leo Fender (creator of the Fender Guitar Company).  We have the same g-g-g grandparents.|`|q5UDI2JJaa	well, i have a squier and i like it. squier also comes from fender, so if you want to save money get a squier. ibanez is a pretty good brand too. its kind of a off brand, but they are becoming popular among many famous musicians and they are a pretty good and reasonable price.

Maybe get a mockup of a giant Q-tip or something.  <br>  <br>  Haruhi Suzumiya is a brown-haired anime girl who's VERY popular right now.  <br>  <br>  Or you could take a look at the girls from Azumanga Daioh|`|wqOTTglaaa	If you want to cosplay someone with brown hair then i would say you should look inti final fantady advent children there are some rown haird girls. Or from fate/stay night  rino Tohsaka, she is cute.Or look into the anime Air gear i like the costumes in that one.<br>  have fun!

ODLCanq3aa	Buffy vs Trinity<br>  <br>  Assuming that the world Buffy lives in is part of the Matrix virtual world, then Trinity would definitely kick her *** because she can just have all the available fighting disciplines loaded into her. But if it's in the real world, then Trinity's on the losing end because she doesn't really have any actual fighting skills <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Buffy vs Beatrix Kiddo/Black Mamba<br>  <br>  Beatrix Kiddo/Black Mamba spent years training different fighting styles under Bill. Buffy has the innate fighting ability that surfaced during high school and she did have some training of her own. However, Buffy is geared towards fighting monsters, demons and, above all else, vampires (ruthlessly because they have no soul) and is mostly ruled by her heart. <br>  <br>  So I think she won't willingly fight humans, unless to defend herself in a scenario in which the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad targets her. In which case, she'd totally lose because members of the Squad run missions where they kill people with neither regret nor hesitation.|`|5umRpOYcaa	Beatrix, no question...Buffy is ...fluffy.   lol|`|3LwbLsXKaa	I think that trinity, cuz she have all that matrix move.<br>  and between beatrix and buffy.

From the album 11:11<br>  March 07, 2008, 10:46:48 AM<br>  <br>  MTV'S AMERICAS BEST DANCE CREW RANDY JACKSON MAC LETHAL "SUN STORM" LYRICS I'm from the methlab city of broken dreams, and cracked out dopamines, where everybody'y looking for an ocean scene, where 'Pac and Biggie are passe cuz back home, we speak in terms of Mac Dre and Fat Tone, I'm from a city where there's actually people, that are bothered by the thought of homosexual marriage, the bible belt, friendly smiles, and Christian steeples, and names like Bobby Sue Williams and Belinda Peoples, this town is so eerie when it snows, all the trees look like ghosts appearing in the road, the crows flew south of heaven and found the elixir, the echo of silence whispers from the mouth of the river, to say... yeah the city could be great one day, but the first step is getting out of our own way. I've been to bigger cities, they produce bigger frowns, I'll die, right here, in this town. And I know, there's something beautiful within my grasp, And I know, I think I'm satisfied but it won't last And I know, to lace my boots up and pick my path, I'll find another rainstorm to fill my glass {twice} So quote my life as written by anonymous, **** it, I think I'll keep the liquid courage and the broken promises, so if you're coming over bring a bottle and a cup, there's a war going on outside-- and I don't give a ****, I could never win the fight for me, I could only minimize the details of my life story, I was born, late July, 1981, skip a bunch of bullshit until now and then the story's done, but I'mma write the chapters later in my life, in a nursing home with a sweet lady for a wife, both of us in wheelchairs we quietly hold hands, it's strange, but one day, I'm gonna be an old man, I hope to be happy on that day because I finally stood up, and moved the hell out of my own way. I need to get the hell out of my own way. And so do you. And I know, there's something beautiful within my grasp, And I know, I think I'm satisfied but it won't last And I know, to lace my boots up and pick my path, I'll find another rainstorm to fill my glass {four times}|`|N5fYraDHaa	hard knock life by jz|`|QgHenusdaa	It's a Hard Knock Life by Jay-Z

Hope that helps!|`|AG6J3wV4aa	more than likely no...ive never heard of a dj that could do that.. that's ur producers job he has the master copy and he would be the one to lower ur vocals on ur track for a show..that is if u work with one... a dj just spins tha track he has no control on how high or low ur vocals are in volume.. but it doesnt matter ... my very first show i sang along to my track its normal.... alot of people do it..just to get used to tha feel on the mic and ur first performance..... and plus once u get on tha mic u'll b louder than ur vocals on ur cd ne ways... so hope that helps... good LuCK!|`|jSsGsin2aa	No. you can turn down the mid range control on the mixer but that lowers the volume of all mid so you'll lose alot of the melody in the track also.<br>  <br>  search for an instrumental version of the track.|`|zOXfVvfkaa	Or you know if you go to any major department store. you can probably find a karaoke track

ehMPOlefaa	I know of this event happening mostly through the hearsay of others and reading it here.  If AI wants to have an ongoing,  successful show then they have to seriously consider replacing her.  The simple mistake she made is too much of an embarrassment to all of them, to the extent that the critiquing of contestants should not be taken seriously.  You can call it a 'little mistake' if you want, but come on!  If she didn't hear the guy sing a second song, then there's NO WAY that she can make ANY comment with reference to a second song!  It's the degree of difficulty in being able to count from one to two!<br>  As far as her speech is concerned, it sounds to me as though she might have some signs of multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease.  Both of which would change a lot of people's opinions about how intelligent she is or drunk or using drugs.  They'd quickly change their own tune (no pun intended) as to how critical they have been towards her.  But I don't know if she has those diagnoses or not.|`|q9BItD25aa	She babbles and I cringe when she gives her little speeches....I feel bad for her. I don't think she is all that intelligent.|`|86e8f65fa3192e60e44157e03e75769daa	You are so right! Poor Paula, I felt so sorry for her last night; and and the night before (when she commented on Jason's second song...he hadn't even sung yet) and who gives a 'rat's a.." anyway! We all make mistakes and luckily for us, we aren't making them in front of millions of people. And shame on THE VIEW yesterday, making a big deal of her blunder and the possibility of her on drugs, meds or booze....I don't think ANY of the ladies are 'sin' free..................|`|051viISDaa	Well the mistake she made was not really a mistake. You know that the judges get to hear the participants sing without an audience before the show goes on tv. So they already have notes on each singer/song on paper. She just happened to jump the gun and give her opinion to early.|`|AA11754314	I think she's just dumb, not on drugs. The only thing that worries me, though, is her speech and/or stuttering has gotten worse over the years. If you remember the first couple years of Idol, she could actually form complete sentences. Nowdays, she struggles to get through a sentence without losing her train of thought. If she is, oh well, it isn't our business.|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	I don't know if it's drugs or alcohol, but I'm also wondering if it isn't something more of a physical deterioration in her brain.<br>  Like she's getting a form of dementia or maybe Parkinson's.|`|61f63887a19e11bbea56be0c43781b2faa	Well I don't think she is stupid, but I definitely think she was under the influence of something !! How can she criticize a song she hasn't hear yet ?? I'm sorry but she was tripping on something !! Randy and Simon had to try to cover up for her but she had already made a fool of herself !! Paula needs to be sober next week and the rest of the season !!<br>  <br>  PS And Jason was awesome Tuesday night !! She needs to apologize !!|`|d7729f1b77962333c3cd195763729abcaa	I missed american idol last night! what was it that she did?<br>  <br>  Oh. well I dont really see what the big deal is. Paula has been the most supportive to all the contestants on AI. She rarely gives any bad comments so why is everyone making such a big deal. people act like its a sin to make a mistake! if you all havent noticed yet, we all make mistakes. Im pretty sure some of you have done something stupider than paula, the only difference is there were no cameras to see you!|`|20c0N8dOaa	I agree with you! She is human, I'm sure all the people making fun of her would have made a mistake sooner or later if they were her. The show was really fast so she got nervous...you could see her hands shaking when she was reading her comments off. I think people need to just back off of her. I think she has done great this season! She has given great comments that will really help the contestants. So go Paula, I give her credit.|`|KpFmUfC7aa	Previous to the actual show, there was a dress rehearsal,where Paula took notes on the TWO SONGS each contestant sang.<br>  So,when the real show was on, it was a simple mistake of commenting two songs instead of one.<br>  <br>  Some people make a big deal of this, as if they had never made a mistake...Shame on you !!!!!!|`|Z2uYisnAaa	haha it was pretty funny but i dont ever say she in on drugs but she seems to studder a lot, its wierd but i guess thats just how she talks<br>  shes really sweet though|`|kbAhk17Xaa	I understand shes human but she could have a least apoligized to poor Jason!|`|gsQfKjgyaa	no, she's just on drugs nad she drinks, amybe she's just a little crazy too|`|tPquogcraa	what is the question?|`|osYEDbANaa	I love Paula Abdul, and the fact that she is not perfect is what makes me love her even more.  The woman has had over seven neck surgeries and is still in pain, she has admitted to being on medication that she didn't realize would make her a little loopy.  She also suffers from insomnia.  I don't personally know anyone who would keep working as hard as she does who is in severe chronic pain and goes on little to no sleep most of the time, yet she does, because she wants to be a positve force for the contestants on American Idol.  I don't care what everyone says about her, I think she is truly a special person who uses her celebrity for good when she could just retire.  I love Paula!!!

They are very deep both politically and psychologically definitely intended for a more adult and mature reader..  I would stick with more traditional comic story lines.  <br>  <br>  I would highly recommend the Marvel Civil War, it's basically a slug-fest between Marvel's Super-heroes  Or get them Planet Hulk and World War Hulk.  Also I would recommend Batman: The Long Halloween and Batman: Year One|`|ErwP75Mlaa	You know what, the way society is kids want to do adult things and it is quite disturbing but when it comes to comic books. I highly recommend the graphic novel of "The Watchmen" it was a 12 part comic series ran in 1985-1986 but they remade the graphic novel of it recently since the movie of it will come out early next year.<br>  <br>  Killing. a not so exposed sex scene, and one amazing story line.<br>  <br>  Your never too young to appreciate a classic|`|YiFl2em2aa	there are number of Spiderman, Teen titans and X-men graphic novels and collections available, which might be suitable.

He's very good-looking and has no trouble finding other lovers, but that doesn't help because he's still obsessed with wanting her back. Then he gets the inspiration that swearing off sex for Lent (all forms of sexual activity, even kissing or masturbation) will give him the perspective he needs. So of course a few days later he meets a woman and they fall in love. Now Matt sees his vow as a personal matter, and won't even tell her about it, but his friends think otherwise, and now the complications begin . . .

FCFQRAvCaa	Nope. I stick in my own ballpark. More familiar with the players...|`|FwsI0wVRaa	No - one is out of anyones league and i'l tell you why, i could be the best looking guy (im not) in the world and lasses would base me on 1st impressions (looks) but obviously we would talk and she would realise im a horrible guy. <br>  <br>  I could be very ugly but have a heart of gold would you take notice - no unless we spoke and i pulled out my charm on you.<br>  <br>  I think the is no such thing as a league but some women and men have criteria such as age, tall, slim etc? Not all but some.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  I'm 18 trying to huck up with someone older and "out my league".|`|31tFu0oMaa	of course why not most people underestimate their own goodpoints anyway, beauty is in the eye of the beholder but beauty isnt everything, however it does help.<br>  you gota try how else do you build confidence & its better to have tried than not to have tried at all.|`|e590942052eafadec97fac23e298a2f1aa	Self worth seems to be an issue here.<br>  <br>  What exactly is this 'league' you speak of?<br>  <br>  You mean they're better than you?<br>  <br>  Hmmmm, not possible.|`|OAhZCjPRaa	Sure, why not?

OyvPAYdlaa	Its about Johnny and June Cash. Heidi is singing about wanting a relationship of her own that is similar to Johnny and June's relationship. Their 35 year marriage is one of the greatest love stories in the entertainment industry. The Johnny Cash songs that she incorporates into her lyrics were songs Johnny and June wrote that are about their relationship. The lines "when your gone i wanna go to" refers to the fact that when June died Johnny Cash died just a few months later.|`|Bi51WJd7aa	I have no idea what song that is but just a guess and the first thing that popped into my head is that it's about (the late) country singer Johnny Cash and his wife June Carter??|`|4nfPKvR9aa	yeah its about jonny and june cash.<br>  <br>  MY FAVORITE SONG EVER!<br>  <br>  lol|`|NGwkbWRkaa	Johnny Cash was married to June Carter (of the Carter Family of country music). They toured together for many years. So I'm pretty sure they're Heidi Newfield's Johnny and June.
4x2KMVbBaa	No, about a trillion people have brown hair and blue eyes, like most of the people around here that I know, including me, my family, my friends, etc.etc.etc....depends on where you live I guess...predominately white here and most are blue eyed brown haired people.|`|AA11289758	While it isn't super rare, the blue eyes-brown hair combination is more rare that blue eyes-blonde hair!<br>  <br>  :-)

The standard fee is 15%, so the better gig you get for the band, the higher your fee will be :)<br>  <br>  Other important info:  networking in your region will help you get steady income - both finding a core group of bands who want to use you, and finding a core group of venues (bars, clubs) - then you can match bands to venues according to music style, demographics, whatnot...<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|0r0X95Mwaa	it usually works like this...<br>  you haggle with the venue to get the best price then you go back to them and tell them you can get the band for 30% less if they sign with your company for a one time fee that just happens to be 20% of the original booking for the band then you take 20% from the band as your fee snort some coke and repeat|`|rh7xXSLMaa	That guy above me is nuts!<br>  <br>  Firstly, from what I've noticed...<br>  <br>  the band gets the door...whatever the fee is to get in goes to the band...if they have a good following that can be a few hundred dollars....if youre doing local talent, that is. They normally get free drinks too...providing they're of age. If you split it 50/50...then a band of usually 4-5 members is left to split the rest..and normally that's not a lot. <br>  <br>  SO, I'd say do roughly 10-15% max. PLUS, if you aren't booking them for blocks at a time, they'll leave anyhow.....make that contract iron clad, but BE NICE.<br>  <br>  I'd say charge about 10% of the |`|8jEeFVhEaa	$500 deposit which will be returned if they get a certain amount of people in the club.  <br>  <br>  To calculate the certain number of people, see how many people you need in the club to sell $1000 worth of food, drinks, etc.|`|vlO1zx3eaa	You shouldn't. You pay them to play for your place. You keep a little profit, but you pay them. Bands aren't out to pay to play. They are making money.|`|ba60dd0df93da088e2288387c7eb0296aa	50% of their income that night.|`|QjEFSO8Vaa	You dont charge them a fixed amount.  You get the percentage of their show revenue.  For example if they sold 200 tickets at a venue for $20 each then the total revenue is $4,000.  You might have to pay the venue for having the show at their location.  The price might be varied for this or they could possibly take a percentage of the revenue if there is enough sales to cover their minimum.  You would only take a percentage of the total revenue because you might be putting the band at jeopardy if you take a large portion of their revenue when they dont sell enough tickets as it is.  <br>  <br>  It would be fair if you asked for 15% to 20% their income.  So on a night they sold 200 tickets at 20 bucks a person you would get 20% and thats $800 for that one show.  Or you could be quite reasonable for a start up band and ask for only 10% and that would be $400 for only one band performing at one gig.  Either way you are making a lot of money for less work and you should go for quantity if you want to make the big bucks.|`|5izt92PAaa	<br>     If i were you i check with a few of your local<br>     D J S,who use to play music back in the big<br>     band era, i'm sure be more than happy to help<br>     you. you can learn alot from them,pay attention,<br>     there are'nt many of them left.   Eric  S   Good<br>     Luck.|`|T1uS2o2Qaa	Why would they hire you? <br>  You will need to be able to get them venues they normally couldn't get. <br>  I have been in many bands and most of the good local talent already have the means and/or a management team that does that already. For bands that are not being 'managed', the best thing you can do is to become a band manager  or management group. |`|nuNlV9M7aa	If you're really interested in promoting new music, give them a break.<br>  Local bands need all the help they can get,you could let them play free.<br>  <br>  Here's a link you might find interesting, but it's from the bands' perspective <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/onemusic/performing/firstp05.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/onemusic/per...</a>|`|8rlKCCkOaa	                  I would say 100.00 an hour depending on your space. My dad owns several clubs in miami and he starts at 4,000.00 an hour/ event depending on the amount of space needed and the amount of people that are supose to attend. but since your starting off new i suggest u start small.|`|XhzBWze1aa	Depending on there performance that night if they did good pay them at least 100 if they did horrible 25 to 50.

7TGs5Tkiaa	I love all of them but I would have to say twilight. I would say this because it opens the whole Series and just is the best.|`|3xifCMwQaa	eclipse|`|Ua0rnKaMaa	the 1st book is the best ..twilight|`|pFZNwYOAaa	they are are awesome.... but twilight and eclipse are my personal favorites.(then breaking dawn, then new moon) <br>  <br>  plus i like midnight sun, i read the first chapter of it(: |`|ntUbBUuxaa	twilight and eclipse|`|EqMNiwohaa	I liked Twilight and New Moon the best. 
OfwMwLPQaa	i thought the first movie was quite good but after that it jst got rubbish, i saw saw 5 the other day and that is comple garbish, i actually fell asleep watching it, and thats meant to be a horror movie, a true horror movie is something you cant fall asleep to. 2 and 3 were pretty poor but not dreadful and 4 was a complete failure|`|yRE2HDr3aa	Hah ah I agree with the first answer<br>  <br>  The first one is decent though, at least it was somewhat original.|`|ccSepzgcaa	If you've seen one, you've seen them all. They suck equally.|`|AA10065077	I personally like the first one the best, but the sequal saw 2 explores more of the jigsaw character. I saw the third and that was the last one I saw because in my opinion there should not have been anymore after saw 3. |`|fY9a02xKaa	the first one. it had a pretty simple plot and nice thrills. the sequels were tryin hard to keep up with the first.|`|Ejw9Yf0jaa	just the first one.....
L2BMjiXIaa	Try Internet movie database IMDB you can fine any movie there.|`|AA10065077	Try netflix or if you want the dvd try Amazon Good luck finding it.|`|6lQ7BXEkaa	Netflix or Blockbuster since they both have online viewing now.
1tE0tCBjaa	They are pretty good in my opinion, but they are no Type O Negative. Together though, that would be great. I mean if they could team up with Diddy and come up with a  new Kashmir. then why not a Zeppelin cover of Black No. 1? Diddy is good though, he raps happy.|`|thTNfqbbaa	I know right, I like Stairway to Heaven but I don't see what's so great about it,don't get me wrong Jimmy Page is a hell of a good guitarists and Robert Plant has good Vocals but they don't have the nice happy feeling like Van Halen does.Besides David Lee Roth has that Style and that Charisma,You just have to like it.|`|50DRQsNSaa	They supposedly stole a lot from blues acts at the time, i believe stairway to heaven  was one that was supposed to be stolen.  Whether its true or not i haven't the faintest clue, i like their music however. |`|55EU5pGpaa	First off, I love Led Zeppelin, secondly, what do you listen to that gives you credit to say this about a great band?|`|XqG45fBlaa	Garage band??? I don't think so. I don't know if you've really heard there music or not but they are no garage band. I don't think they are overrated at all. |`|3adf34a77d61d407aad0b9e439793108aa	"HELL NO"",THEY DESERVE more credit they shaped rock we hear,only to be corrupted by jonas brothers and bon jovi|`|foqFJOFTaa	They're so bad that they don't even want them played at the music shop in Wayne's World|`|QefPPeMkaa	mott - you must be young kid |`|6TzYRsrmaa	Led Zeppelin is an award winning band, also being the the 6th best rock band in history (The Beatles being the first), they have earned the right to have fame and fortune. The garage sound they have is from the old recording they had back then. If you listen to old rock band like Black Sabbath, you'll hear the same type of old garage sound, but Led Zeppelin makes it sound like it belongs that way.|`|mJNWOWIIaa	i listen to mostly r&b music but Led Zeppelin is an AWSOME band their music is pretty unique and funky i give them mad props|`|c4915188681351ae48e3e8dbbb67e2baaa	Not at all!

Zeppelin will alway be one of 10 best bands of all time.  Name one band of today who people will be talking about 10, 20, or 25 years from now?  Zeppelin will be though|`|76d0f42b082dd7b4403317013a48817eaa	No. They are sometimes given too much credit for being one of the inventors heavy metal, but they are far from overrated. As far as the garage band comment, Nirvana was a garage band, not Led Zeppelin.<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW, what do you listen to?|`|AA11039335	Haha, what the hell have you been hearing? :S|`|euZRbiA2aa	Dont like them myself.

I read the book), but idk.. maybe. i'm kind of interested in seeing who they've got to play Lita Ford.|`|9ywRsjQDaa	she's pretty but I don't think she can be as beautiful or actually a very good actor for her|`|XX5aAbspaa	Most certainly not, I really think they should have used an unknown for this part.|`|VH98AKVgaa	isnt she the girl from twilight?

d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	Great call on Sevendust.  They've been criminally overlooked for a long time now.  The kiss of death for them as I believe it to be was starting their career on the uber-dysfunctional label TVT.  That did them no favors.  It's amazing they were able to persevere in spite of their utter incompetence.  Their manager was indeed a bastard. <br>  <br>  KMFDM – It’s a freaking joke that these guys have been around for over twenty years with very little to show for it.  Of course, vomit rockers Rammstein have had more success merely copying KMFDM (early on in their career).  Why?  Quite simply, the mainstream is terrified of most forms of darkwave.  They don't know how to market it and most are ill-equipped to understand what it’s all about.  Hence, the geniuses that reside at the record labels decided to dumb down the formula and gave us Avenged Sevenfold and My Chemical Romance.  KMFDM has managed to stay relevant by constantly changing the formula and never becoming stuck in a time period.  Adding Lucia Cifarelli to the mix has given them an entirely new dimension.  And Sascha isn’t complaining either.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWmHAVGoRFI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWmHAVGoR...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9yasd70O4I" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9yasd70O...</a>|`|dc49d60c4d19a92e193ce2f41c92cfedaa	I think either <br>  Prong<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl-5TrGakWY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl-5TrGak...</a><br>  <br>  OR<br>  Sepultura<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aIEhhP_ZOU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aIEhhP_Z...</a>|`|FfxmE9Toaa	Sevendust sells well enough and gets enough airplay to qualify as mainstream rock. Nice guys, too. I met them on the way up.<br>  <br>  I nominate Little Feat, who only became popular after the death of founder Lowell George. Their work under his direction was brilliant and the Rolling Stones said "They're the best band nobody's heard!" Mick and Keith used to attend their concerts.<br>  <br>  After L.G.'s death, radio and people took notice.|`|0BoDF6iBaa	I think if Sleater-Kinney.

It's disgusting, Imo.<br>  <br>  My example would be Zebra, who were in My opinion one of the finest and most unique sounding Metal Bands of all time. Yet they achieved very limited success and basically have a small cult following now 20 years later and that's it. I think that in Zebra's case their uniqueness was their downfall, the vast majority of People are quite sheeplike and don't appreciate anything that strays quite so far from the average run of the mill tripe (Like Zebra's contemporaries Poison and Bon Jovi who are not either 1/10th as talented but achieved astounding success for being mediocre at best) It's sad but it's also an unfortunate fact of life.<br>  <br>  I'd like to give You some links and show You what made Zebra so great, but since WMG are the biggest stupendously flaming assbins on the face of God's Green Earth I cannot since they have all been removed from Youtube<br>  <br>  F*ck You Very Much WMG.<br>  <br>  I'll see what I can find on Imeem in a jif<br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  <br>  Here, some of what made Zebra so great on Imeem, who doesn't have a stick jammed 3 feet up their ***<br>  <br>  Who's Behind The Door<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/nuzuHY/music/9Ni2Objd/zebra-whos-behind-the-door/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/nuzuHY/music...</a><br>  <br>  Don't Walk Away<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/4KCTQDo/music/yoeZ7C33/zebra-dont-walk-away/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/4KCTQDo/musi...</a><br>  <br>  Time<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/popmusic2/music/poaNWRPV/zebra-time/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/popmusic2/music/poa...</a><br>  <br>  Making You The Fool<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/4KCTQDo/music/XHCrO86q/zebra-making-you-the-fool/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/4KCTQDo/musi...</a><br>  <br>  Bears<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/popmusic3/music/5VaDruDg/zebra-bears/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/popmusic3/music/5Va...</a><br>  <br>  But No More<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/popmusic3/music/QwCBv1B0/zebra-but-no-more/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/popmusic3/music/QwC...</a><br>  <br>  As I Said Before<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/yTTXCpZ/music/QDejnTjQ/zebra-as-i-said-before/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/yTTXCpZ/musi...</a>|`|pLPKo6mBaa	I've liked Sevendust ever since I first heard "Denial" on my brother's ATV PS2 game, lol.<br>  <br>  I've always wondered why Waltari isn't so popular....well, for all I know they may be in Finland. But I've never, ever heard anyone else mention them online, aside from their own website. They've been around since 1986 and have released 11 full albums, a few EPs, 4 Best Of compilations, a couple live albums, and about thirteen singles or so. I can't even put a label to their music, as nearly every album is different from the other. I've personally heard them mix metal, death metal, hip hop, industrial, punk, symphonic metal, progressive metal, thrash metal, electronic music, and even some pop influences into their music (though not all at once, thank God!!).<br>  <br>  You might remember them - remember the creepy clown video with young Tarja? They were the ones who came up with that stage show.<br>  <br>  I can't really give many links ... Youtube sucks and doesn't even have their best songs on it.

Well, actually maybe thats why. They don't know who they are talking to and they don't care. All they are doing is trying to occupy their time and maybe by puttin otheres down they feel better about themselves. I'm sorry if people have been rude to you.

If some people appear rude to you, it may be that these people have issues with people in general. And this is a way for them to act out their fantasy of being smarter without having to show their real face. If you could talk to that rude person face to face, they would not do it. There has been a similar sort of rudeness on comment boxes on websites. Here, you may be anonymous and this helps the more crude get away with a lot. Perhaps also it is a way of getting attention from others.15 minutes of fame without telling someone who you are still is appealing to some. There is also the bully mentality. Which may fall in line with egocentric need to dominate others. Don't let it bother you. Those so rude, are those so lonely. :)|`|19jVm7edaa	It's more fun then being nice...|`|HBFP7BJkaa	i think they think they're clever to be rude on other peoples questions because some of the personal questions people are still rude on them which is not going to help anyone at all so in my opinion if people are going to be rude or sarcastic they should just not say anything at all|`|c8lBbWtQaa	Sometimes yes sometimes I think people are trying to be funny & it appears wrong in print.

kJ7mcPLbaa	She made her own decision. But, she basically is telling him that it's okay that he abuses her because she went back for more. He WILL hit her again, they always do. I don't care because neither of them have any talent, and they don't care about my life, so I don't care about them! Pregnant or not, she's showing the world that she doesn't love herself or the baby if she stays with him! She's better off as a single mom then with an abusive man who will eventually hit the child too.|`|j7wESGaDaa	they are setting a bad example, but i think people/media just need to let her be. she's upset as it is, she doesn't need people telling her what to do. she's a grown woman. getting back together with Chris really isn't the best thing at all for her to do, but it's her life she should be able to do what she wants without all these people on TV telling her what to do (i'm sure she gets enough of that from her family, why else would she cut off communication from them. she doesn't need it from anyone else).<br>  <br>  but on the other hand, they could be setting a good example in the long run. they're both writing a book together on domestic violence and their relationship. and i heard that after all this is over they're gonna be making a bunch of talk show appearances explaining what happened and speaking out against abuse. so we'll see what happens...|`|RR2FKrsnaa	I think it's up to her but I think she's mad to take him back. Once a woman beater always as woman beater.<br>  <br>  <br>  He's a loser and should lose his public career.<br>  <br>  She should leave him, especially being in the public eye as youngsters look up to her, she is, as you say setting a bad example?|`|d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	People in love do crazy, stupid things...  usually they aren't worried about setting examples, they're just acting on emotion.<br>  <br>  I'm surprised that she's still with him, but he'll suffer other consequences regardless, which he should.|`|VH98AKVgaa	its none of our business...  <br>  we dont know every little detail of what happened just what the media told us (and they loove exaggerating)|`|eFkdCBjkaa	Of course not, they're both idiots.|`|kGBmrwyraa	Rihanna is a grown women she can do what she wants when she wants! And stop calling chris brown a "women beater" you guys have  no idea what happened you guys are just hearing he said she said! LEAVE THEM ALONE let them "live their lives" so what they got back together it happens everyday! If it was anyone else ya'll wouldn't give a DAMN! So stop with all the negative feed back cause you'll don't have any idea THEY ARE IN LOVE!! If it happens again  its her fault cause she went back! And also Rihanna is not all that innocent she went through his phone and on youtube videos it shows her behind the scenes at the reharsal smacking chris and throw his glasses and cussing so LEAVE THEM ALONE!!<br>  Xoxox alexzandria|`|Ud8n4Lknaa	no and yeah for real it shows a bad example: idk if he probably threatened her azz to get back but dam i can't believe they're just gonna live their lives like none of this ever happened: he left her unconscious almost dieing, i just hope his career's over-i hate him even more, how was he not raised with the idea to not hit girls that homo|`|eLH97QiEaa	i think that is one stupid *** girl obviously from the way he beat her it wasn't the first time. I think if he does it again i wouldn't even be upset with Chris she is not making the best decisions. i see it this way beat me once shame on you beat me twice shame on me beat me a third time and i'm just stupid for staying with you lol|`|pxUwNKbgaa	I agree with you James D because its like Rhianna is saying that its ok for men to hit women and that if they do you should give them another chance. Uh I THINK NOT!!! I just hope he doesn't do it again but I was so surprised because you wouldn't think that he would do that. But hey you can't judge a book by its cover!!!!|`|LOZLRaVKaa	No what Chris did was wrong and I do not think Rihanna should have taken him back for what he did to her.I think the only reason why she took him back is because she might be pregnant.|`|hqK7QWl0aa	it's stupid.Rihanna is meant to hate him after summit like this. btw did u see her face, it was scaryyyyyyy.

To be fair, prices in most areas including utility bills are beginning to simmer down a little. The heart of the matter is employment, simple really, if yoyu have a regular job, then it's business as usual or generally plain sailing, but if you haven't or that your hours are reduced, then it can have a big knock-on effect towards how you manage your own budget and your lifestyle. That's why it's important to be focused on your job, perform to the best of your ability, learn to get along with everybody including your manager and keep complaints to a minimum - cheers.|`|AA10949869	Actually...no.

Pyt1n12Waa	Nothing is what I've done today! No, seriously, describe it? That is an interesting question! I suppose it depends on how you look at it really, it could be something that isn't there, or something you want to pretend isn't there when it really is, for example, you're feeling low and when someone asks ''what's wrong?'' the first thing you say is ''nothing'' When in fact there is something.<br>  I don't really know what i'm talking about so i guess i'll stop now lol.|`|EUdCd3Uxaa	thats easy here goes ok<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  hows that see how I spelled it|`|ROWSzTknaa	I'd rent a theater and open the dictionary to "nothing".

Colloquially, the concept is often used to indicate the lack of anything relevant or significant, or to describe a particularly unimpressive thing, event, or object. It is contrasted with something and everything. Nothingness is used more specifically as the state of nonexistence of everything. Philosophers imply that if one were to have nothing, they themselves would literally not exist, and the concept of nothing, is not just improbable, but merely impossible.|`|sJNoTGQVaa	I just wouldn't speak<br>  <br>  Now... describe the any colours, without using another colour or object for the description|`|oPSO1jRdaa	You cant describe that...its not feeling or a situation...its just a word used to respond or talk..!!!|`|k6UI5Z2jaa	There's no such thing as nothing, only something. :D|`|0bX3uZ3Baa	emptiness. lonely. dark.|`|XAAF7R23aa	i would hold my hands a foot apart and ask the someone to describe what they saw in the middle|`|x3uCecWsaa	I would describe "Nothing" as nothing....|`|ODvnyAdlaa	the absence of things

I generally mean the standard of american movies, they just keep degrading and du,bing down its pretty ridiculous. But on the other hand i have to argue that fact that german cinema has improved vastly (the lives of others, The baader meinhoff complex, downfall). America has just run out of ideas so they have to revert to getting high and making, stupid excuses for film such as Pineapple express, and harold and kumar. Lets face it hollywood has lost its glam!|`|UUUpjhlQaa	Kind of.  There are some quality movies coming out, but the REALLY good ones only come out every few years.  But you're right.  I've even noticed that the last good Steven Spielburg movie was Schindler's List, and he used to touch things and they would turn to gold.  Indiana Jones (NOT the new one) Jaws, Jurassic Park.  Now what?  AI?  The new Indiana Jones movie?  He's lost his touch.|`|hQj7V54qaa	no they have gotten better :)<br>  <br>  1) role models <br>  2) sex drive<br>  3) pinneaple express<br>  <br>  etc... watch them you just might enjoy the sex humor |`|0ynTni7yaa	no I don't think so, most movies today is more better than the past if it is action....|`|Ej4nDZOCaa	Sadly,yes. Good thing Twilight is coming this Friday. :}|`|PHsrITPQaa	Go see Role Models :)|`|AxQXAmnXaa	yes |`|xqrwDmyUaa	I think there is just more movies being made now than ever before. I mean when there was less films being produced than it was all about quality since the studios didn't churn out a new movie every week. But now there is so many movies being made that there is also a lot more crap lol. There are still plenty of good movies out there they are just getting buried by the crap ones so it's hard to sift through it all.|`|kle6DM2Naa	ugh yes. especially these remake movies of old shows! where is the creativity?|`|I5P2OSAjaa	batman (1 & 2) and v for vendetta are at least three, so not ALL movies suck, though i know that's not what you said.

It's a castle and there's knights in it. There's also an arcade and things like that, it's cheap too. But like everyone else said, Circus Circus is clearly a kid-friendly place too.|`|vNP5nmiTaa	Circus Circus, or New York New York. <br>  <br>  Circus more for younger kids, New York older kids cause of the over the city roller coaster ride.|`|IaNtLlE7aa	circus circus|`|RplkclzJaa	The Luxor has a pretty big arcade in it if they like that sort of stuff.

New York New York has a large kids area, too.  <br>  <br>  They all have very elaborate and extended areas just for kids and non-gaming entertainment. (Non-gaming =  no gambling)  It can get expensive, but it will provide a safe environment for your kids. <br>  <br>  Contact the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce and they will send you loads of information on the Vegas area and things for families to do and see.|`|iLhTHtuvaa	any of them but the palms<br>  <br>  the palms is the play boy theater place<br>  <br>  but circus circus is the best becuase it has the adventure dome<br>  <br>  that place is loads of fun<br>  it has a lot of rides in it  = )<br>  <br>  i love that place|`|NxtC4p77aa	stayed in Luxor when i went there when I was 6 and it was really close to this big kids casino where you could play lots of games but win cuddly toys :)|`|MwDP5oFuaa	the kitten house|`|y90nyfBraa	the green one|`|HkXYGAOdaa	MGM
jF1xH89Caa	No, it just means you are thin skinned and can't take too much harshness in your life. That doesn't make you weak...it makes you rare|`|e37b1e55a5a94cf30d038c8a0dd1c521aa	i hope not because i consider <br>  myself to be too sensitive ~|`|tvQStwpGaa	Absolutely not. I've been told I'm sensitive but I watched both of my good friends die in front of me. Sure it scared me for life mentally but just because your sensitive doesn't mean your weak minded|`|3942e77c035cfc36aa7643acff17d6bcaa	Depending on what you use it for, I would say quite the opposite such as empaths and psychics. |`|0SoX3rUxaa	I've felt that way before. Now that I'm older, I've learned how to shut off my feelings.....|`|89FgPZ9Waa	Not really.|`|rJuoPJ4qaa	I agree with Jay...not at all does sensitivity denote a weak mind.  You can be sensitive but others may try to take advantage of that.  Learn to go with your gut feeling when dealing with people who may not have your best interest at heart.  If you have an inkling your heart or name will not be safe with them, run like your a$$ is on fire.|`|zYKb2Msmaa	Not at all.  We can't control how sensitive we are, as its our make-up.  |`|AA12322997	I don't think so. I'm sensitive but I have a strong mind. There's just things I don't like; it doesn't mean I'm weak.|`|BD8hkBlBaa	ya,because your easily hurt by small things so probably alot of headaches|`|dnpB79V1aa	No, it means that you have an open heart.|`|UNI7BtsYaa	Not at all. It does mean that you're a pansy though.|`|cp7regataa	weak willed|`|jHWEEZmCaa	no but all the idiots i meet might think so|`|OEa0KT8uaa	Sensitivity is a STRENGTH.  <br>  <br>  Being "too sensitive for your own good" is weak.  <br>  <br>  In other words, if your sensitivity is harming you, then you need to find a way to tune into your emotions and judgements and harness them into productive results.  A sensitive person has an advantage if their emotions and judgements can move them positively through the world. <br>  <br>  Try reading up on NVC - Nonviolent communication, a form of communicating developed by Marshall Rosenberg.|`|AA11450203	Absolutely not!   Being sensitive means that your intuitive to  your feelings and that are truly a caring person.  There may be problems associated with being too sensitive by having your feelings hurt quite often.  People can be sensitive without wearing their feelings on their sleeve.  Try to not allow people to effect you so much while at the same time holding on to your endearing qualities of caring.  That will save you much grief into the future.|`|dBJEjkhAaa	I always think about this because I have always thought I was very strong and could handle anything. But when it comes to certain things I am so sensitive and cry. I can't stand it! It seems like they are opposites of each other, so I don't know how I can be both...!|`|a1358e946495daea79a1b3aaef48879eaa	Well it can mean you can be extremely paranoid.|`|a59ef2d6e344a5e9aa6f055a0dfa92f1aa	HELL YEA!!<br>  <br>  You better toughen up soldier!!

He was in town doing the comedy club. (I knew a lot of the bar tenders and waitresses that worked there.) Usually after close one of the bartenders/wait tresses invites the other employees and some friends back to there house for an after hours.

BhQSTvLsaa	Nah, man. You know me. I prefer black or biracial guys. But not too dark. You gotta be like a mocha caramel color. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, it's pretty rare for me to be with a white dude. And you will probably NEVER see me with an Asian or an Indian.<br>  <br>  However, I'm not racist. I don't have problems with Asians or Indians. A lot of them are very good looking. But a lot of Asian and Indian guys are not my taste. I usually fall for the niqqas. lol. End of story.|`|DvjX2DFKaa	I really don't care, If I like someone, I'll date them. But a lot of the ethnics will only mingle amongst themselves. And the Muslims are promised in marriage as children. To them it would be unthinkable to breed with an infidel.|`|5jqfKDdfaa	Is it racist if i WONT date my own race?<br>  I get looked down on alot for that, but again...it just goes back to preference doesnt it?|`|GeyFdO5jaa	No it isn't.((..it's just who you may be attractive to. ))|`|RFcbLXh3aa	sure it could be just preference, but not everybody in the world is rascist like the 2nd answere said, some people are colorblind, I am colorblind. I don't see color, I see personality.I think Everybody should be equal. <br>  <br>  It is better to judge someone for their actions and personality rather than stereotype them because they are of a certain race. stereotypes are dumb. Give people a chance, they just might surprise you. Otherwise it's possible, you might be missing out. But hey do what you want, it's your life. And we all make our own choices anyway.|`|MBqSntreaa	I don't think it can technically be considered racist, more preferential. Now if the person chose not to date other races because they had a dislike for them (and dislike for the stereotypical characteristics of that certain race), then that could be considered racist.|`|fKuvMPCiaa	No, sometimes you're only attracted to a certain type of person. I don't think it's racist at all, you can't choose who you're attracted to.|`|jF1xH89Caa	No. It's simply just what your attracted to or not attracted to. I have never dated a black man, but that does not make me racist in anyway. I just have never been attracted to any that I have met.|`|6PMGheWxaa	nope! i have dated a black guy before but i probly wouldnt again. i have no reason, just i am not attracted to them .|`|LSNffo4jaa	Nope!|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	Everyone in the world is racist, even if they don't want to admit it.  It doesn't mean you hate an entire race, but you can dislike certain stereotypes about a race.  People should just admit it and get over it.|`|y1vrMUCYaa	No it isn't...it's just who you're attracted to. <br>  <br>  I frankly don't see the big deal, I am color blind to the individual. I see what's on the inside and thats who I love. <br>  I have always dated, or been atteacted to men of color...and my fiance is the most beautiful soul on earth.

Iov5Z7O4aa	Sounds like the title of a Bond Movie.  <br>  <br>  A gorgeous young woman diecovers an insidious plot by an evil corporation to make all women look silly, and obedient to the coporation, via a new hair dye...<br>  <br>  She becomes the Bond girl, after meeting him on an elevator at Macy's.  She convinces him to give up his vacation and help her, and becasue she is so smart, witty, and cute, he agrees. <br>  <br>  She barely survives the escapade, resists his advances, and goes on to found an empire of bon bon shops.  Bond goes off to England sulking.  <br>  <br>  How about "Dyeing to be Curled" instead?<br>  <br>  or "Ink's Place"<br>  <br>  or "Corporate Do's!"<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you want a Munsters or Addams Family theme, "Curl Up and Dye" might go over well in today's economy!|`|voETd7tSaa	It sounds like a great place to get shagged. I would take my youngest son there. The little shaver might enjoy it. Just be careful. The first cut is the deepest. This truly could be a hair salon to dye for. Could I bring my pet jack rabbit in so that you could cut the hair on my hare? Let me mullet it over for awhile. I may take my soccer team in for a trim so I can get the whole crew cut. It could be just shear madness. Make sure your ad in the yellow pages is easy to find. You don't want people to have to comb through it. You want no part of that.  Offer reasonable prices, too. You don't want to scalp your clientele. Use real poo, not that sham poo that is totally fake. You must condition your customer to sit still during his or her appointment. Use your head and watch for dandruff. People can be such flakes.|`|3c7d80f08451c9eed6330074560c2b09aa	i under stand the message about hair .. but um how do i say this hon i wouldn't do this name. due to if ya one of your workers or you do a bad job on it would surely hold the name curl up and dye in a diffrent spelling ..( if it looked bad im sure they would say that place called curl up and dye makes you want to )|`|92ef5561b80fe6efaf5ba1c2d333fa30aa	not great i like serenity salon, simply paradise, new images, thats my style, a cut above, top 2 toe beauty, so fabulous. <br>  <br>  just a few but it is entirely your choice and what reflects you.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|ook5DUUDaa	depressing|`|7qcakl4haa	It just makes me wig out.

If not, why's Superman holding a corpse dressed as Batman at the end of FC #6? Who's that guy in the Prehistoric Past? Is it Bruce Wayne? If yes, how? If not, what's he doing with Batman's utility belt? And since when would Batman give away his toolbelt when he knew damn well he would need it in such a harsh environment?<br>  <br>  See? Frustration. <br>  <br>  My only answer for you is someone else will wear the cowl, most likely Dick Grayson. The only other worthy ones are too young yet and the rest don't measure up.<br>  <br>  jdk|`|ZfsgIDa0aa	Technically Final Crisis is finished and Batman is dead for now, but most the tie-ins and companion stories are still going. So yea, being sent to the past, Batman has been dead for a few thousand years now, hence the rotting, mummy-looking corps Superman holds. I'm sure they'll find a way to bring Bruce back somehow (in the past 3 or so years, 2 flashes, a hand full of green lanterns, and soon martian manhunter, and a superman and boy will be brought back to life as well), but im pretty sure they won't bring him back any time soon and yet they're still planning on releasing Batman comics, so i beleive someones gonna replace him.<br>  <br>  My guess, it's Grayon. Bludhaven is destroyed, Batman's dead, and they're no longer planning on releasing Nightwing comics. So it kind of makes sense that Grayson becomes Batman for at least a little while.

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	Pleasantville (1998)?--The television "box" is a portal to an alternate reality.<br>  Here's the plot:<br>  David, single, lonely and not happy with his life, flees reality by watching Pleasantville -- a 1950's b&w soap opera, where everything is just...pleasant. His sister Jennifer, sexually far more active than her brother, gets in a fight with him about a very strange remote control - given to them just seconds after the TV broke by an equally strange repair man - and they suddenly find themselves in Pleasantville, as Bud and Mary-Sue Parker, completely assimilated and therefore black and white, in clothes a little different and with new parents...pleasant ones. David wants to get out of the situation as well as his sister, but whereas he tries to blend in (effortlessly, with his knowledge), she does what she likes to do. One event leads to the other, and suddenly there is a red rose growing in Pleasantville. The more rules are broken, the more colorful life gets in Pleasantville, USA.|`|wz8gx3gaaa	13-B which is recently released in India starring Madhvan and Neetu Chandra.|`|4yLqV3Fraa	Rab Na Banadi Jodi|`|09fdLaeIaa	are you talking about The Ring and The Ring 2|`|5PJJfgdkaa	I Think It is 'The Ring'

pLZUtFewaa	It doesn't happen much now if at all. The actors/actress get gifts for events in their real life but I doubt they would keep them. Also for eg Becky and Steve's wedding was filmed 6 weeks ago so what would be the point in gifts at the time the scene is shown?|`|3arJsZ91aa	Years ago I had a friend who was in Coronation Street for a while.  Sadly he died a few years ago, but while in hospital, he had a visit from the then baddie on the show.  Apparently some lady hit him with her handbag because of what he was doing to Rita.|`|Jaw2sW3eaa	I will send Becky and Steve,a zip to shut Becky's mouth up or a bag of tranquilizers to shut her up for good.|`|ca45a20110b39435a05dfafc8745bf11aa	I don't know anybody who has lately but yes...people really do it.

ioNTTqKfaa	Rakim basically invented the whole style of rhyming that rappers use today, internal rhymes and multisyllabic wordplay. He was the greatest of his time. There are others today that are as good as him, and even surpassed him, but given that he was the first "greatest rapper", that's why he's still considered one of the greatest rappers, and deservably so.<br>  <br>  I don't believe in top fives|`|aJfBtT9iaa	Rakim is very underrated most ppl dont know him, you should listen to paid in full and the archive<br>  <br>  1. Nas<br>  2. Rakim<br>  3. Biggie<br>  4. DMX<br>  5. Jigga<br>  <br>  EDIT: idk man maybe hes just not your taste.|`|xb3RjkV2aa	Rakim has a good flow, but I also don't listen to him reguarly, I can't get into his songs that good either.<br>  <br>  My fave rappers, MCs and Hip-Hop artists.<br>  In no order:<br>  <br>  1. Immortal Technique<br>  2. Jedi Mind Tricks<br>  3. Cormega<br>  4. 2Pac<br>  5. Mobb Deep / Proof / Fabulous (Any one of those, they are/were all underrated IMO)<br>  <br>  Technique and Jedi Mind Tricks both spit real Hip-Hop, whatever they feel like saying, no restrictions to talking about real political issues and such, as they are Underground Hip-Hop, and totally underrated. <br>  <br>  Cormega is just a personal fave, his song "Beautiful Mind" had an awesome background beat, also, if it weren't for this guy, Nas would never have been as good as he is now.<br>  <br>  2Pac, not much to say, he tried to tell people the messages, got through to some, but by the looks of it, not everyone.<br>  <br>  Last 3 are other personal fave's. Proof was totally underrated and he had so much potential. Mobb Deep, also tried getting a message through to people, but they don't do much songs anymore.Fabulous, I just like his flow :)|`|0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	I've never really gotten into his music either, although I do like some of his music. I don't think he's overrated but hes talked about a lot by some of these guys. Hes a really good rapper, and I wouldn't care if hes talked about by some of these guys. I don't mind it. He also created a lot of things that some of the rappers use today. He was a good rapper back in the day, and deserves a title as an MC. You posted this twice, by the way. <br>  <br>  My Five Favorite Rappers:<br>  1. Tupac<br>  2. K'naan<br>  3. Talib Kweli<br>  4. Eazy E<br>  5. NAS<br>  <br>  Edit: Thanks man, Pistons are my second favorite team. I love Detroit, I lived there when I was younger but I always visit from time to time.|`|gPuASwcWaa	Rakim is a little underated but that does not take away from his lyrical greatness and stories.<br>  <br>  Top 5:<br>  <br>  1.Nas<br>  2. Kanye West<br>  3.Common<br>  4.2pac<br>  5.Notorious B.I.G|`|6chLhNJhaa	I think he's overrated. He's my dads alltime fav rapper...he's wack if you ask me.|`|drjbYK6Faa	hes good, but there is no best rapper alive - <br>  top 5 (no order):<br>  1. eminem<br>  2. nas<br>  3. 2pac<br>  4. biggie<br>  5. talib kweli

You must learn, it just pisses them off, especially when you are blatantly right and they are blatantly wrong.|`|6y5wgdmHaa	Even if she is wrong, she's not going to admit to it now - well, now that I see it's playful......but I wouldn't use those words again:  you'd be treading on thin ice.|`|nooi0ldjaa	as long as you have a car to sleep in, and a mcdonald's within 10 miles you'll survive, other wise your screwed.|`|vCSQnIlRaa	That depends on your girlfriend, but that is quite hilarious.|`|eRVRWwkBaa	Maybe.

Just depends what u were talking about|`|EtSPbSzcaa	Just give her your credit card and cancel it when she leaves that will give you time|`|jeZmqhNcaa	Go buy red roses, some chocolates and in the card write "I love you baby, thanks for always being here for me.  I know you're right every time we have a stupid fight, and I love you for showing me that."<br>  <br>  or something lol xx|`|vK9Vv9gjaa	depends if you are really right or not. If your wrong and shes right it just makes you a A hole|`|9o7KlfvKaa	Hmm.

That's life, get used to it early.|`|r3o10XbAaa	Good luck. I guess it depends on what you were arguing about. So, if/when she breaks up with you, you should probably get a better, real girlfriend who can handle the truth, or simply some healthy debates....|`|iygl6BlLaa	Kinda depends on the girl, and also the tone of voice you said it in.<br>  <br>  Yep, cute kitten avatar is right.|`|S4soZUFCaa	All males are right, according to them.|`|RwY6mk43aa	er. depends. if she usually gets offended by Stupid comments like that or just shrugs it off.|`|yixKb0ocaa	You were a good kitten, dude<br>  I'm sorry it had to end this way:(|`|yfxM0P8taa	Yup, you're screwed.

But if it was something serious and you said it and actually ment it, it wasnt a joke, then prepare for the worst.|`|aCRpZz2Taa	least you din tell your gf that "doctor!? hahaha...women can't be doctors!" i said that and evne thought im right she still slapped me =/|`|W0WlFz1aaa	you shouldnt have said that.

But id do it jokingly.<br>  <br>  :]]|`|i9MKTn26aa	What a cute kitten avatar.|`|6NdC58n8aa	Yes, If she hasn't already dealt you 'the worst', she's stewing and will boil over on you when you least expect it.|`|8x9Fz6b4aa	though your opinion is most likely the most logical and probably more economical, hers is always right.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ....unless its obnoxious and you have to stick up for yourself|`|axylPYftaa	break yo self, cuz<br>  break yo self|`|CvWp7PZ2aa	No unless she is like crazy|`|de28048ab10e261734a9e1e41461c18aaa	i dont think so... sometimes you just gotta be blunt and if she cant handle the truth then that would be her problem not yours|`|rn5PGvFUaa	Probably. It could go either way.|`|iMtEcac0aa	lolz pretty much screwed but maybe you'll be ok:) but don't prepare for the worst :) just something bad maybe a few tears on the lady's side :(|`|rWat0x0eaa	tell her whos boss when a mans right hes mof*ckin right aint no ifs and or buts about it|`|vakNCxYDaa	OMG, all guys are suppose to say," Baby, I know I'm wrong, and you're right,  I'm sorry."  you always say that!!!!|`|zPGjFdJhaa	All that I can say is: you could be screwed.

9rLi9pSRaa	I think it is stupid and not funny at all.  Mincing around and trying to do a parody on women is rude and immature.  I don't like it and turn it off if I see it on TV .  I think a lot of women do.  If you want to be a woman get a sex change and do the whole thing.  We , women rarely ever pretend to be men and talk in deep voices.  Its stupid.  If you are gay, then be who you are.  It is unnecessary to consider these charades for laughs.  It has been done ad nauseum and time to be yourselves and move on.  That shtick is passe.|`|r6oi1HyZaa	it's to fill in for their despaired lives|`|e1d902a1e3f67c79f0006f242202774daa	i don't know.<br>  <br>  but when my best friend does that and then sing in a really high pitched "moulin rouge" kind of songs, it cracks me up.|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	Just like they can't help being gay, I honestly don't think they can help their tone of voice or lisp anymore than you can control your eye color.|`|tDU347knaa	I have no idea. It sounds so odd. Maybe it's supposed to be more feminine. (Which it isn't.)|`|ib00OjJXaa	same here<br>  hearing their voice makes me laugh|`|b6c9b3f40f9ac8337ea22396c739b02faa	It cracks me up uncontrollably. I work with a really flaming gay dude and I cannot stop laughing when he gets off on some dramatic tangent. I don't think he cares, though.|`|svYiQZUHaa	I guess because it makes them seem more feminine. When actually I just want to smack their face and try to knock that lisp out of them.|`|iddMxOroaa	They will do anything to stand out and be different just to show their originality.|`|R6YQOKitaa	I actually find it cute :D|`|BVaCJkxzaa	Who knows.

uFSDEo9Uaa	Some people might think that it is ignorant believing in horoscopes, but some other people really base their days upon them. Even when horoscopes are global descriptions of events that could happen to any one, people still believe that they can reveal aspects of their daily life.<br>  <br>  Psychological experts attribute this to the Barnum effect, which is defined as the tendency for people to accept general descriptions as particularly applicable to them. However, not everything is as simple as it seems to be, horoscopes are based in symbols, planets, and astrological houses.|`|IVy35SE2aa	astrology is based on science of numbers.  Interpretation is an art.<br>  The horoscope is cast based on where the planets were at the precise<br>  time of your birth. That is the math part.  Now, what does the placement of the planets in the signs and houses mean. And what are the angles between planets.  How you use this information is based<br>  on your memory of many different factors.  As you gain experience and insight you will be able to paint a more accurate picture.<br>  So the reason your chart often gives good information is because <br>  some one remembers what the various signs and transits mean.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	That's an easy one - it DOESN'T<br>  <br>  Most horoscopes, particularly the ones in newspapers or online, are written in such general terms that it would be unusual if they COULDN'T be read as being "correct."  And those people who believe in such nonsense, there is an inclination to "see" accuracy.|`|8DCslWmMaa	The idea behind how astrology works is that the planets have a gravitational relationship with the earth and the life upon it.<br>  This can be readily seen by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the tides. Law enforcement and hospitals will tell you that things get crazy during a full moon. <br>  Since the moon is so close we feel it's pull more than the other planets.<br>  These influence are not as visible and work more on a psychological and environmental level.<br>  There is a lot more than just a horoscope. Actually most horoscopes are not natal specific and usually are not accurate.<br>  One has to look at every planet and where it is to get a right on report.|`|5fcM3HLsaa	All astrology is bogus and arbitrary. <br>  <br>  Horoscopes often 'come true' because they are vague, and can be interpreted in numerous ways.|`|fHpPgMlZaa	It doesn't.

AA10065077	Yes I know a hero. My hero is Dr. Azita Hamedani. I was in a bad car accident and she saved my life. Everyone including my parents told me that I would never walk again. Dr. Azita Hamedani made it a point to visit me in my room. She told me that I could do whatever it is I wanted to do I just had to believe. A year later I was able to walk on my own. Five years later I was graduating from med school. All during this time she stayed in contact with me and told me that things would only get easier. When I interviewed for an emergency medicine residency she was one of the doctors that interviewed me. When she asked me why I wanted to do emergency medicine medicine I told her it was all because of you. I made the doctor cry. I got the residency and she still is very supportive.|`|8ryz9VpKaa	Spiderman<br>  Spiderman<br>  Does whatever a spider can|`|FExFNoEKaa	my mom. its not easy being a single mother and raising a child that's NOT a hooligan.|`|8CBmINSsaa	My mom, for taking care of 5 kids and herself when she had almost nothing|`|yKEGzFIoaa	My hero is Brett Favre.<br>  <br>  Not because of the fact that a lot of the time he's a crazy drunk and he needs to take painkillers every day.  No, it's because of the way he plays football.  He started playing for the Green Bay Packers before I was even born.  He plays with a child-like enthusiasm constantly, even though he runs the risk of being injured almost every play.  Well, he is injured too, and that's the main part of why he's my hero.  He keeps carrying on through the pain, and passes over impossible obstacles.  He's one of the best role-models a person could have.<br>  <br>  Plus, Brett had one of the greatest performances ever by a football player only the day after his father passed away.  That's one of the kind moments that you'd want anybody to have.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hqe2GSKpzro&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hqe2GSKpz...</a>|`|KOOsjLvUaa	My Daddy he helps me get through stuff<br>  <br>  My Heroine is my Mom she is my chance of life w/o her i wouldnt be here|`|2f1746d6b48fa8137bc4a44c1f5e8455aa	My hero is Jon Stewart.  He has realized just how screwed up out media is when it comes to politics, and he has become famous so that (among other reasons) he can go onto the shows and publically ask them why they are ******* up.  If you look at a videos of him on youtube on other peoples shows he really hits hard on how our media is screwing america over.
FD8I4zthaa	And now it's up my (or yours) Uranus.|`|32P3hG0Laa	The moon, as someone else said, spends roughly a little more than 48 hours in a sign. Every time you see a full moon, it means the moon has gone through all the signs in the Zodiac since the last full moon. (Same with new moons. I just used the full moon as an obvious example.)<br>  <br>  You must have gotten erroneous info to think the Moon changed from Aquarius to Leo in a day or so...|`|kTnrnJ0waa	That is not possible. It could not have been in Aquarius just the night before. Perhaps a few nights ago, but not the night before. The moon is the most rapidly moving astrological planet, satellite, etc. It stays in each sign for a little bit more than 2 days. I heard it was two and a half days but it seems to be a little less. So, if your looking to observe the moon in a certain sign, you have to be attentive because it changes rapidly. I think it was in Aquarius a few days ago. Its in Leo now and on Monday it'll be in Virgo and by Friday it'll probably be in Scorpio. Just think of it this way, the other planets take a while to move through the signs because they're orbiting around the sun, so it takes them a while to get in that space where they'll be under the influence of a certain sign. The moon orbit around us(the Earth), hint its intimate relationship to our deeper self in astrology, so it passes through the space where it'll be influenced by each sign much quicker. For a visual, draw a circle, representing the Earth, then draw a ring widely around it representing the cycle of zodiac signs and divide it into twelve sections. Then draw a small circle next to the Earth, representing the moon. It orbits around us regularly, so this'll help you to SEE how it goes through each sign so quickly.|`|d2dkgYRaaa	Moon in Aquarius was about two weeks ago. The moon changes signs about every 48 hours or so, not to mention that it goes void of course between signs quite often. The Moon is in Leo until late late Sunday, then Virgo for Monday and the Full Moon on Tuesay. It was just previously in Cancer for two days.|`|9azX3N4Laa	The Moon is not like the other planets that take months or even years to change into another sign. The Moon is the fastest moving planet so it changes sign more rapidly. If the Moon was is in Leo this morning for example it may be in the next sign over by noon. It would than be Virgo.
ihxO8qApaa	because the actual problem is never truly solved|`|Zi6Fr49Laa	The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. I'm not sure why people stay in bad relationships with their parents, just as many stay in bad romantic relationships. I finally broke my pattern and keep a distance from my parents. It's been great for my life and the life of my whole family! <br>  <br>  Do you live in a different town from your parents? That's a great start. Get more involved with your work or volunteer for something. You'll not only be enhancing your own life but you'll be too busy for your toxic parents.|`|IYdgEQ4kaa	You set the preconditions and related expectations yourself.

(There was a message on my answering machine, but I was on the way and didn't get it until I got home 4 days later)  unbeknownst to me, snuggled up to a friend of his that I hadn't even met. As I was being um, frisky he woke up and said "Although I am enjoying this immensely, I need to tell you that I don't know you!" I grabbed the blanket and left the room. They laughed over that for years and I never, ever got in bed, (or undressed) on a trip w/o turning on the lights and verifying the occupant before crawling in bed.

w69mYa23aa	I wouldn't say you're too young. I started teaching when I was fourteen. What really depends on is how well you work with children and if you understand how to explain things for young children to understand. I charge $10 a half hour.<br>      When teaching kids who have never learned anything on the piano, the first few lessons are going to be all about teaching the notes. Make sure they understand the two and three black keys. You might also want to print some material off the internet. Also go to a music book store and decide what cirriculums you might want to use. One for a little older children (say 8-10) and one for younger children (4-7). You'll want something pretty easy for the younger children. Don't suggest a book for the first lesson since you need to see how fast they will catch on to what you're teaching them.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|64jTtN0jaa	Yea I think you are a little too young. I don't doubt your ability to play, but there are many people out there who can play very well but can't teach for beans (not that I'm saying you aren't able to teach). If I was a  parent who's forking over money for piano lessons for my child I would much perfer an older more experienced person to teach my child. <br>  <br>  You're so young and only 15 years old. Live life up a little! Being only 15 you shouldn't have to worry about making money.|`|hNinyCdBaa	My brother (6) is taking piano lessons from my friend (15) who has been playing for 10 years.  I definately don't think you're too young.  People should look for experience not age.  Try teaching friends' siblings, where parents know you.  I take lessons from a band director at a neighboring town, and he charges thirty dollars for a half hour, so I would charge less, maybe 20?  Whatever they want to pay, as long as it isn't skimpy.  I would suggest having music theory integrated into what you teach them, and remember that little kids ears aren't as tuned as yours to rhythm and such and their finger strength may not be as good.  Ask them and parents to make sure they practice 15-30 minutes every day (they are young and can't go as long).  Try to remember what it was like when you were little.  That may be hard.  Get lesson books from a shop and follow those.  Praise them.  Give them stickers.  Little kids like stickers.|`|6LIBZ3nLaa	I started teaching piano at 13 to get myself a laptop. And considering you've already been playing for 11 years, that's even more experience than I would have had at 15. <br>  <br>  If you can prove yourself to be a responsible teacher, you'll probably do fairly well. It might help if you start out by teaching younger relatives, cousins, or friends first- just to get some experience. From there, your friends/relatives can refer their friends/relatives to you if they want to take up piano.<br>  <br>  Teaching tips- get note-reading flashcards, be patient, and be fun. The age level you're aiming at is pretty good- if you teach a student who is too young, and you dont have that much experience, the result could be deadly. Always try to leave a good impression... but that shouldn't be too hard for you.<br>  <br>  Charge-... for beginners I'd say around $8-15 per hour. Yeah, kinda low but hey, it's money.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the teaching, and be sure you can commit to it.
Z6tqdAoGaa	The original uncut version of The Evil Dead...its the only movie thats ever made me drop my coffee.|`|UpJbXh7Vaa	It's really hard to pick one. Saw II was really good because it's so sick and demented. I could never think up something like that. I also liked 1408. It's about this posessed hotel room that pretty much makes people kill themselves. There's a really awesome plot twist towards the end. The Ring scared the sh*t out of me when I first saw it. I kept a pillowcase over my tv for a few weeks. The Ring II was even scarier because she didn't just come out of TVs, plus the part in the hospital with the nurse and Aidan was just insane!|`|QAwwmDuDaa	i like the shining because it shows what humans are like when they are tired and confused.|`|6w7FKrlfaa	the hills have eyes.. cause it's realistic..  nuclear bombs could lead to deformation.. incest.. more deformation..  it has everything i love.. rape, torture, blood, suspense... and of course the end scene of 'one of them' looking at the survivors through binoculars resulting in a no. 2.<br>  <br>  as for the saw movies.. i use to love them too.. but by the third.. i was over it.. the 4 and 5 sucked...|`|FQi1qZhpaa	Well I Too Love All The Saw Films :D:D<br>  <br>  But The Shining Is Definately, The Best, And Scariest Film I Have Seen.Its Disturbing, Freaky, Strange And Petrifying<br>  <br>  I Hate It, Cos It Scares Me Sooo Much, But I Love It Just As Much, Stanley Kurbrick Did An Amazing Job And Jack Nicholson (And Even Shelly Duvall) Made The Film Perfect.|`|RFcbLXh3aa	I LOVE Dawn of the Dead, Poltergeist, The Ring, Premonition, The original Nightmare on Elm Street, The Shining, and Rosemary's Baby. :)|`|cOUvCZCraa	The scariest I have seen is The Exorcism of Emily Rose, freaked me out! But I think The Ring is good, I was flipping out when she came outta the screen, ahhh, the old Halloweens, the first Poltergeist. A lot of newer horror movies are dumb, just too much sex and blood. The older ones were the best!|`|AA10918673	I think Ive seen every horror movie ever made :) My husband and I are horror movie buffs! Its hard but Im gonna say my favorites are House of 1000 Corpses and Devils Rejects. I dont consider the scary, but they have great blood and guts! I was actually really scared when I saw The Exorcist and The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Those kind of movies freak me out :)|`|dDrhBnpxaa	The best horror film I have ever seen is The Shining, if it falls into the classification of horror and not psychological thriller.<br>  <br>  It works on so many levels. The cinematography from Kubrick is spot on and all the characters (maybe apart from the annoying Shelley Duval) contribute to the eerie atmosphere of the Overlook Hotel.|`|CaE3JOMbaa	Yeah, I love the hills have eyes. and poltergeist. I'm not sure which version I saw, so probably the new one.<br>  <br>  Just last night I watched 28 Days Later. it was really good, but not very scary. there was hardly any suspense. But it actually had a story line, and a pretty good one.|`|cQnBFFXoaa	2 movies that still freak me out at night are "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" and "The Shinning", I mean who doesn't get scared with the twins in the hallway or when u get up at around 3am and hope that u don't smell smoke?|`|XtBFA6Dlaa	I say Halloween by Rob zombie, it was very well done, and good acting|`|09fdLaeIaa	Quarantine<br>  cause there is rabies|`|LWXMUmFOaa	the ring<br>  1408<br>  hide and seek|`|Wf8195iUaa	My favorite horror movie is One missed call because of the end they made it seem like there was going to be another one. <br>  <br>  Another one of my favorites is My Bloody Valentine 3D.<br>  i love that movie because it is a horror movie in 3D and it was amazing.|`|a655a5c7c451f60d392e2152454ed4c7aa	Freddie V Jason<br>  <br>  <br>  Nudity = epic|`|o9VKZKpQaa	try 'the hamiltons'.<br>  dead scary.

UmIRYF6Jaa	Best day   -   My Wedding day<br>  Worst day -   Day my husband died.|`|4MVIJvbiaa	First of all im only 15 so imma say the best and worst day so far...Theres plenty more to come. But its really hard to only pick one for each. Cuz ive had tons of good days and thousand bad days..<br>  <br>  Best day: Mhm this one is tough. I cant think back so far in the days. So i guess the most recent best day was any day with my boyfriend. Haha. Wish i had a better one to tell you.<br>  <br>  Worst day: I would have to say my worst day was September 22, 2008. This is because my older sister who is only 17 was bitten by fire ants and had an extremely bad reaction. It was horrible. She broke out in hundreds of hives and stuff like that. She couldnt breath. Her me my mom and dad were sitting on our front porch and it looked like she was slowly drifting away from us. Well the ambulance came as well as the fire department. They took her away. My mom went with her. Well on the way to the hospital they had to make a dead stop because she started to convulse, i think thats what its called and they had lost my sister. She was gone. But they injected medicine into her and she started to breathe again and they took off for the hospital. Well they worked on her for 4 hours until she was better. Well she got to come home that night. But she could have gone into shock at any moment and like die so we had to keep an eye on her and stuff. But it was just horrible to see her like that. To see the ambulance and fire department outside my house. Because i hate that stuff. And to had to hear all those sirens scared me. I hate that stuff. But yeah...It was just horrible.|`|hBeedeMuaa	so far the best day of my life was when me and my bestfriend and her brother who was also my boyfriend..........we were driving to go meet my bestfriends boyfriend. but something was wrong with the car so my boyfriend pulled over and checked under the hood to see what the problem was. i got out and looked to {trying to flirt...i had know idea what i was looking at}. and while we were looking my best friend some how got in the drivers seat and was like "let me drive" in my mind im like oh sh*t......were gonna die. so he let her. for some reason i thought it was safer to sit in the back so i did and i strapped up pretty tightly. so she starts the car and instead of her going foward she's backing up really fast {so much for the back seat being safe} and my BF friends like screaming at her saying "the break, the break....no not that, thats the exeleration...the break!!!!!" so all of a sudden were backing up into this sewer ditch type thingy and almost hit a damn tree...that would have been the end of me lol! but while she was backing us up into the thing he got out of the car thinking he was the incredible hulk an tried to stop the car lmfao!  so were in the sewer ditch and its dirty water, mud and a bunch of other crap everywhere and i had on flip flops too. me and my bestie turn to each other trying not to laugh cuz my BF is going crazy saying  "WTF, WTF, U DONT BACK SOMEBODYS CAR  INTO A SEWER DITCH WTF"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   but thankfully some mexicans were in the near by field playing soccer and they saw the whole thing, they helped us out the sewer ditch and called a friend who had a truck to get the car out. while we were waiting me and my bestie were getting attacked by killer mosquitos...and being starred at by the mexicans lol! i walked over to my BF and was like "this is a  turn on" lol! and hes like really? they got the car out and it only had 1 long scratch on the back i think, it was completely fine 4real. then my besties BF showed up and he was like "damn, all this to come meet me". ill never 4get the way he tried  to stop the car...it was hillarious i think i saw him changing colors and everything lol! it was my best day cuz it was just so funny the name of the street we was on was called {LEGATION CT.} ill never 4get that name.<br>  <br>  <br>  my worst day was when my father died....RIP daddy i love you and miss you?|`|ovxcNAl3aa	the day before my school's homecoming game and the day [and night] of the homecoming game and dance last october, those were both the best days and the worst days of my life.|`|uLelMuqZaa	1.

2BSBnRqYaa	Franz Ferdinand - No You Girls
AA10426129	Undone - The Sweater Song<br>  by<br>  Weezer<br>  Album: Weezer (The Blue Album)      Released: 1994US Chart: 57     UK Chart: 35 Get the Ringtone   <br>  <br>   Songfacts:  <br>  This song is about going insane in public. Here's some lyric analysis:<br>  "If you want to destroy my sweater, hold this thread as I walk away" - Keep doing what you're doing as I drift further into insanity.<br>  "Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked" - Watch me drift into insanity, I'll soon be there, naked being full insanity.<br>  "Lying on the floor, I've come undone" - Lying on the floor, I've become mentally Undone.<br>  <br>  The opening dialogue is used to show how he is at a party, losing it, and no one notices or cares. The 2 verses are used to show how he's barely able to think and talk straight on his decent. The part about "I don't want to destroy your tanktop" is showing how other people are on the brink of insanity already, but he's not "pushing them off" like they are to him, then "To see you lying there in your Superman skivvies" shows how every one is on the brink of insanity to begin with, even more so then he was in his "sweater." The music helps illustrate the ever-maddening mind of the guy, as it starts out normal, then at the end is hard, dark, and mad sounding, showing his slow decent into madness. (thanks, Derek - Pittsburgh, PA, for above 2)<br>  <br>  Many of the promotional singles sent to radio stations contained an edit that cut the guitar solo short. This was a distribution error, but didn't have much effect because most radio stations played the album version. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)<br>  <br>  People who dig this song also like "1979" "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and "Basket Case"<br>   Send "Undone - The Sweater Song" Ringtone to your Cell  Get Artistfacts for Weezer<br>  More songs by Weezer <br>  More songs about insanity <br>  More songs with items of clothing in the title <br>  More songs that were an artist's first hit <br>  Listen to "Undone - The Sweater Song" like you've never heard it before. ?Get it Free. <br>  Comments:<br>  <br>  A, I think your referring to TIRED OF SEX, I dont understand this song though so I cant say<br>  - Brian, Vancouver, Canada<br>  <br>  I LOVE the sweater song!!!! its awesome to just jam out to!!!!!<br>  - Amanda, Evergreen, CO<br>  <br>  This song is about sexual repression and being jaded about sex. The protagonist is apathetic and jaded, and ignores people around him because he just doesn't care. The guy he speaks with in the beginning is his opposite, and outgoing flirtatious sociable type. The protagonist used to be like him, but has now become tired of it. Any woman he comes across offers him a relationship and implied carnal relations, but he is too jaded to care, perhaps because of being hurt in previous relationships. The chorus is about how girls want to have sex and undress the protagonist, but he is not interested, and just goes along with it because the girl is doing all the work. "If you want to destroy my sweater, hold this thread as i walk away." He walks away from sex and relationships because hes had it all and it is nothing new or interesting. Basically, it explains how one who has had so many bad, flaky relationships cannot find a true, substantial one. Everywhere he goes he is surrounded by shallow chicks who love him and leave him "undone."<br>  - A, Ellicott City, MD<br>  <br>  i think john is totally right.. it is not about insanity. it's about being a loser.<br>  - Benjamin, Monroe, WA<br>  <br>  SONGS REAL MEANING!!!!! If you will follow the writer of this song?s life (Rivers) and all his songs and not just read into this one song you will figure out what it means which I did. Johnhale_6@yahoo.com. The start of the song has Rivers at a party where he is approached by an old friend. The old friend is way chill and can socialize easily. He comes up and is like hey man how?s it going etc etc etc. All Rivers can say back is one word answers because thus far his whole life he has been a f&$%ing dork. (read about his life in college and how he could never talk to a girl or express himself in words or watch any interview of him at this point in his life). Rivers realizing he will never be the ?cool? guy say ?I?m me, me be, god d*mn, I am? basically expressing his anger to himself because no matter how hard he tries he still can?t be like the cool guy. He then say ?I can sing and hear me know me.? He is basically saying that the only true way for him to get in touch with his feelings, or express himself is to sing about it, and that is how he gets in touch with himself. (see el scorcho lyrics how stupid is it I can?t talk about it I gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart). The second verse the girl River?s likes takes off with the cool guy and when River?s sees her leave he says ?oh no it go it gone bye bye? It refers to the girl of his chances with the girl. Using the word ?It? was just the best way to describe his feelings about her, or maybe ?it? describes his chances with her that night. I feel he purposely leaves the lyrics vague because he is wearing his h

aMWQAD0Jaa	<br>  Heya, You have a decent voice and you obviously could/are making some money from it. It's not original, so I doubt you would get anywhere as a lead...but that's not a bad thing.   <br>  <br>  It's a bit strange that a professional vocalist is asking opinions  on thier voice from a place like Yahoo Answers. Do you not have an agent/management that could give you some more reliablele advise?<br>

9azX3N4Laa	You can't keep a job because you're always seeking a new and u bored in your jobs. Your midheaven is in sag and you have two other planets in sag. Sag is the sign of seeking and learning.

You should be a psychologist or a psychiatrist because you are already one without the degree. You have to remember the tenth house is not what you should do, it just tell how your energy works in the area of your career or job. The sun, moon, and mercury are really the job matches. <br>  Sun, Moon, or Mercury in Scorpio= Psychiatrist, psychologist, detective, policeman, undertaker, pathologist, butcher, sewage worker, pharmacist, psychic medium, spiritualist healer, criminal, insurance, big business, armed forces.<br>  Sun, Moon, or Mercury in Aquarius= Scientist, writer, sociologist, charity worker, Air Force or work in the United Nations, inventor, radiographer, industrial worker (particularly in television), astrologer, astronomer, archaeologist. <br>  I am an aquarius myself thats why im into astrology.

qRKOWgS0aa	Crime is everywhere. In our neighborhood, in the neighboring state, wherever we look, we find criminals and crime. Criminals have become a part of our daily lives. Does this mean we let them be the darkness of our society? No, definitely not. Eliminating crime and criminals is our duty, and we cannot ignore it. Getting the rightly accused to a just punishment is very important. Some criminals commit a crime because they have no other option to survive, but some do it for fun. I do not advocate death penalty for everybody. A person, who stole bread from a grocery store, definitely does not deserve death penalty. However, a serial killer, who kills people for fun or for his personal gain, definitely deserves death penalty. Death penalty should continue in order to eliminate the garbage of our society. Not everybody deserves to die, but some people definitely do. I support death penalty because of several reasons. Firstly, I believe that death penalty serves as a deterrent and helps in reducing crime. Secondly, it is true that death penalty is irreversible, but it is hard to kill a wrongly convicted person due to the several chances given to the convicted to prove his innocence. Thirdly, death penalty assures safety of the society by eliminating these criminals. Finally, I believe in "lex tallionis" - a life for a life.|`|fQMV03zJaa	I'm for it.<br>  Well, the number of crime would be so high. Capital Punishment per se helps to lower the percentage of crime. Without it, our country would be full of criminals. On the other hand, some innocent people are being convicted. That's true. But, I'm still for it.|`|LgNqYUECaa	I'm for.

We don't have it in Britain, and i'm glad. There are sometimes crimes committed which seem heinous beyond belief. We should not, as a society, drag ourselves down to the same level. I've been to jail and let me tell you, it isn't fun. it seems to me that LIFE imprisonment is a more apt solution than a quick, relatively painless death. Let their conscience eat at them. Let them know how much everybody despises what they did. Never allow them any personal liberties ever again. But don't commit the very act you're punishing them for. Life is not for us to give or take.<br>  <br>  Nice question, have a star! You got almost as many for this Q as i've got altogether...|`|DBdiyaN6aa	Against!!

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	According to the dictionary: Motif is a noun 1a. A recurrent thematic element in an artistic or literary work. b. A dominant theme or central idea. So motif just means that it's the theme that is recurrent or dominant.<br>  I thought Memento was mostly about trust, judgement, selective memory, manipulation and of course, undying love, all with a very twisted edge.

This is the classic 1952 version w/vocal by Betty Roche and the great tenor sax solo by Paul Gonsalves. It was originally on the LP 'Ellington Uptown' which I have. You could go to Amazon.com and search for 'Ellington Uptown' and listen to some of it there, or maybe buy it. Over eight minutes, but worth every second. Good Luck.

The idea that there has to be more to life than this because nothing brings joy and satisfaction. <br>  <br>  To be honest with your question, I think the only thing that counts is whether or not we know God and have a relationship with him.  I heard he is (past, present, and future tense at one time) for our joy- reason to exist.  I have not fully discovered this, but I am on the road to learning this fact.  <br>  <br>  I found out that one of my teachers will not be renewing my contract due to performance, and I have had time in the past 24 hours to reflect on this situation.  I let my fears of economic survival cloud my judgment to take of my present situations.

Cameron takes charge as she has treated the patient before, and she and the team figure out ways to bring the hospital to the patient's home, much to Cuddy's disapproval. But as the patient's condition worsens and their options for treating him inside his home become increasingly limited, House and the team scheme to get the man into the hospital for surgery without causing any further physical trauma or emotional anxiety. Meanwhile, Cameron and Chase attempt to work through some kinks in their relationship, and House deals with an annoying itch he cannot seem to scratch as Wilson comes up with his own analogies about House's prickly situation in "The Itch"   It ends with House going to Cuddy`s house to tell her he cares about her but after getting to the door changes his mind and leaves.

The less popular a show is the less likely it is to last on the network. Sundays are good air times for shows as well as weekdays but most people go out and have fun on Saturdays.|`|bm3R5Cq4aa	well msot people do go out on saturdays and because the majority is not watching tv, no shows want their show to air on saturadys, ebcause then no one would watch it except that select few.|`|AA10973537	Not everyone has a tv either.  Like me.  There is enough on the net and DVD's to keep me going.  Who NEEDS tv anyway?|`|PPyMhRJAaa	I remember when Saturday night TV used to be good. Even the morning TV was good then. Now it is really bad. I just watch DVD's or stuff I have taped during the week, if I'm staying in.

It would be like an obesession with working out or running or anything that is healthy for you to be obsessed with. Also dieting (which may not always be healthy).

But if Paul W. S. Anderson is the one writing or directing the film i think it will be horrible. <br>  But i really hope it will not be a disappointment because i sick and tired of video games movies always being horrible|`|HJYjlmasaa	I hope they stay true to their wanting the movie to be about the games and not go off on some other bullshit and mess up the Resident Evil names. I think those films should just be renamed or something the only similarities are some of the characters' names. Man I'm getting mad just thinking about it. I hope it is truly about the game.

Emmett was too!! I loved it!! Decode might have been playing when they were dress shopping, but it might have been the other Paramore song...I can't remember.. You didn't notice any of the songs?? They played "Never Think" while they were at the restaurant, and they played another Robert Pattinson song when he was sucking the venom out, but I don't know what song that is. I wanna know!! And I know they played "Flightless Bird" while they were slow dancing. "Leave Out All the Rest" was in the credits..and yeah. That's all I can remember right now..|`|jSdpVcKCaa	OMG! LOVED IT!<br>  I watched it today with a friend (:<br>  Er, I think decode poped up when girls were picking out the dresses?<br>  <br>  One of the parts that made me laugh is when Bella comes into the class and Edward watches her and all of a sudden he's like covering his mouth and is like 'OH CRAP' LOL he couldn't resist her scent.|`|dGPBweVtaa	YES I KNOW ONE SONG :]<br>  at the end they played<br>  leave out all the rest-linkin park.<br>  i loved the movie.<br>  edward is sooo hott (:|`|xHUbSGYWaa	yeah jasper was funny. if you look at a picture of edward scissor hands and jasper in twilight you can see a resemblance. |`|ldlmPH4yaa	yes they are making movies for the rest of the series|`|u0Yzb2Y0aa	awww i didnt watch it ur making me jealous!! :(|`|xk1burW3aa	Summit Entertainment has gained the rights to make the rest of the series into a movie, and Taylor Lautner is excited to get into more depth about his character. Right now though, they're focusing on Twilight and it's success. There is no script written for any of those and for what I read no one has "officially" signed on. However, it's only a matter of time in my opinion. <br>  <br>  The book was way better than the movie. The movie was good for as far as movie's go I do agree. It was just nice to see it acted out in front of us. I felt the casting was really good for all the characters. And yes.. Jasper was hilarious with his "looks like he's in pain" expressions, he was just an amazing character to watch. The movie was well done. I liked it. I loved seeing it at Midnight, I just wished they would have gone a little more in depth with the back story like mentioning Carlise knowing the Volturi and all that. And Jasper not getting his best line, "I know what you're feeling and you're wrong, you are worth it" that is something I would have loved to see. Otherwise, I'm not complaining. I was happy with it.<br>  <br>  As far as I'm aware Decode wasn't played in the movie except for at the credits. I know that Robert Pattinson's song "Never Think" was the song they played during their dinner at the italian resturant, and The Muse's song "Supermassive Black hole" was the song played during the baseball game. And Iron & Wine's "Flightless Bird/American Mouth" I believe was the song they danced to at Prom. <br>  Then obviously Bella's lullaby|`|S2duGkDHaa	wow all the people below dont know anything<br>  decode was never played, paramore just made the decode video for the movie, Haley is obsessed with twilight just like everyone else so she deticated 2 of her songs to the movie...and decode is not playing in the dress shop, its the other song she gave to summit entertainment, its called I Caught Myself<br>  <br>  and of course they're gunna make all four movies, the actors already signed a contract saying they must stay on untill Breaking Dawn is finished.|`|3823745f3487e1005b71330c7196ec78aa	Girl, Twilight is frikin amazing.<br>  i saw it last night!<br>  i wanna c it like four hundred times!<br>  TEAM EDWARD BABY!!!<br>  Yes decode was played idk when but it was like really faint sounding!<br>  and i think their making one for new moon and the rest but they wont be out forever!<br>  and IM READING NEW MOON! AMAZIZNG!and jasper just sat there i love him! HES SOO FUNNY!!<br>  |`|xFqP8Ejkaa	i loved the book the movie disappointed me just a little bit but i still loved it!<br>  <br>  I didn't like how Jacob and Bella met<br>  The meadow was not what i expected...<br>  I loved the cullens and the faces Jasper and Edward did when they saw Bella I like when Edward sucked her blood lol|`|mdoo4wxWaa	hahaha, yeah jasper was funny. i liked the part when Jessica said jasper is the one who always looks like he is in pain... but then again, i didn't like how they didn't explain some of the parts|`|jlSvEAptaa	i hate twilight!  it sucks just like YOU

Otherwise, you'll be one of those who cry "too violent" or "I don't get it" or "not EXACTLY like the book".<br>  <br>  Forget them. Watch the movie. It's worth the $10.00, unlike teenage emo vampires...<br>  <br>  jdk|`|AbRfd29Haa	Yeah.. here's my short review:<br>  <a href="http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqotLldmXWtXSvnaexiZs9DJZwx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090307012609AAnwe7Y&show=7#profile-info-AA11552242">http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  If you read the book, I think you'll love the film, as I did... unless you're one of those folks who's just way too into the book. I mean, yeah, best graphic novel ever... no one's arguing that (though I'd put Neil Gaiman's much longer Sandman series up there at the same level). <br>  <br>  If you didn't read the book, it's probably still a good film.. one of the guys who went with us yesterday didn't, and he still liked it. But I think I'll get more out of it next time, as I did with the book. <br>  <br>  And anyone expecting another "Dark Knight" will be disappointed... it's not even remotely your typical superhero film. It's much more about ideas and a connecting story than the pursuit of any obvious villain (there IS a mystery story, but it's in that sense, it's more Mystery or Film Noir than classic Superhero Epic... that that itself is only a thread upon which to build the story in a connected way, not the essence of what's good about the story). <br>  <br>  There's action, sure.. and some pretty good stuff, which I really think expanded the story.. I got a stronger belief in the whole concept of "Masked Adventurers" who didn't really have superhuman powers (eg, most of these guys are of the Batman/Green Hornet school of heros) actually seeing how they fought. I'd put some of that up there with Clint Eastwood in "Unforgiven"... just as his William Munny seems to be practically a different species in a gunfight than your average cowboy, the impact of seeing the former Watchmen get into fights with "regular criminals".. they're really something different. I was a honestly a bit skeptical, from the book's portrayal... this is one thing film just does better. <br>  <br>  I'll admit... I'm a big film buff. I love reading, too... I also acknowledge that each media form (novel, graphic novel, film, miniseries, etc) has its inherent strengths and weaknesses.|`|CvnYpAXSaa	I read the novel and the movie followed it well but the directing was sub par and I really didn't get the same feeling when i saw the film when i read the novel.

tGAt3ZKkaa	I was feeling super sick in school in grade 5.<br>  I ran really fast into the bathroom, which ended up being the boys bathrom!!<br>  I ran into the stall and ended up throwing up all over a boys bare lap!!!<br>  OMG!!!<br>  I felt so embarrassed, I just ran out, without saying sorry, but now I wish I had.<br>  <br>  I was at my cousins house with my parents and my friend.<br>  I badly wanted a puppy and kept bugging my family for it and so they all went into the basment to talk about it.<br>  My friend and I stood at the first step which for some reasonw as outside the door and we were listenign.<br>  We soon heard my mum say they would get me a puppy for x-mas.<br>  M and my friend started jumping around saying "yah yah! woohoo!" and then the step broke and we went flying through the floor.<br>  Everyone was staring at us, all we did was get up and go " . . . bye" and ran upstairs. lol<br>  <br>  We were at the beach, pretty far out, her boyfriend was surfing and we were just floating around on a massive board her dad had made.<br>  And a massive wave came at us all and knocked her BF of his surfboard and us off the board. And while I was under the water my bikini bottoms came off and my friend BF did a face plant on my bare butt!!!<br>  <br>  OMG!! I tried to talk to him saying "uh, what a coincidence!, me, you . . . my butt!" and I paused "did I just say that?"<br>  <br>  every thing between the 3 of us was just quiet for at least 1 hour.<br>  <br>  lol<br>  <br>  AND<br>  <br>  We had 70's night at my school, and I wa sin year 7 and so I didn;t know whatw as going on and what we were going to have to do and so, I grabbed my arm and said "what the hell is going on I feel like an idiot" she was holding a microphone and so everyone heard it.<br>  I felt like an idiot.<br>  <br>  AND<br>  <br>  I was with my friend and her BF (yes the same BF that face planted into my butt) and we were at the movies, my crush came in and we went to sit up the top.<br>  As my crush sat down, my friends BF said to me "hey Jen stop" I turned out I was in such a dreamland of love (lol) was leaning over the next rail of seats.<br>  I sat up and (oh, i forgot to say that infront of us was a long wide rail down to the front of the room) and so when we got up, (the movie wasn't over, we just hated it) I tipped over my friends foot and landed on the wide rail and when my friend and her BF tried ot help me they accidently let go and I went sliding down the rail!<br>  I was screaming, really loud, saying things like "OMG help me!! aug!!"<br>  I hit the bottom and fell off the side and I got up to see everyone laughing their butts off.<br>  <br>  OMG and there are SO many more embarrassing moments but it would take a book to list them all.<br>  <br>  literally|`|EjyD1sXeaa	walking along at a fair with my husband, and putting my arm through his - only it was someone else's husband!!! but the man said his wife never talks to him as nicely as I did.

Trillions of dollars of wealth evaporated into the mist, the bill of rights was rewritten to eliminate the freedoms we used to enjoy, our dollar devalued so far that currency shifted to a barter system.  Power grids shut down, and people starved in the cities.  It was only us "rednecks" who could feed our families, (with our evil guns we hid when the govt. came for them),  and build shelters, and we didn't mind, because generally we aren't whiners like the people who screamed the loudest and started the shift from capitalism.  We lived a simple life, tucked back in the woods, ate healthy and stayed fit because of the hard work it took to stay alive.  The government pretty much left us all alone, because we had no money to take in taxes.  Meanwhile the lefties in the city were stricken with disease and starvation, and we had to start shooting them when they would approach us, for fear of infection.  Eventually us "rednecks" were the only ones left, and finally we lived in peace.

Excited etc etc. ;oP If I could, I'd jump about & run around!|`|o9VKZKpQaa	yep.<br>  'cause i'm still counted for as a child.<br>  and i'll neevr let ti fade when i'm old.:)|`|ihxO8qApaa	alive and kicking, because its so much better than being any kind of adult|`|6cRSlq0Xaa	it's taken over meeeee! :D|`|IWzdqPGTaa	I Wish!|`|naUNP1isaa	I'm a fun loving freak!!!|`|HkXYGAOdaa	yes, I am free spirited and innocent|`|KuWLNfYbaa	The outer one is nearly dead let alone the inner one--seriously i don't think that the child inside ever dies, no matter how old you are.Maybe you see something in the day that evokes memories of the past and you are young again in mind but the old body lets you down and brings reality home to you.My mother who is quite old says that she feels the same about life as she always did and old age only comes to mind when bodily pain lets her know it isn't so|`|9g734Pjaaa	Maybe a little TOO alive ... I get embarrassed easily.|`|wmBK9uASaa	Oh yes... "Never lose the child within"...I loved my childhood...|`|a1UkVGpHaa	Yea :)<br>  I'm energetic and get hyper easily.|`|M8f4BorPaa	oh yeeeah. cause i love it. adults suck|`|QGU3kURjaa	my inner child is alive  and i think everyone has a inner child , but in someone he can control it but in someone else the inner child is controlling him/ her which  is not good.|`|BswVoF8Paa	Yes..and it'll never die<br>  <br>  Because everybody needs to have fun|`|14f68b3ce9b74fe1effcb259219a38a9aa	Yes but very quite because he is on Ritalin|`|ff8f1f5e6ae77b2318640fce7787a746aa	Yes!

fptVcxDIaa	Depends on the dater.|`|kEtYEmhqaa	Hell if I know for Christ sake.|`|JBv7pwrHaa	It depends on what you are.|`|5cLZlX30aa	I think it's probably best for you to date someone who has a lot of the same views as you.  I could respect an atheist and probably date someone who is one, but I don't think I could be married to that person because it would be really difficult.  I would want my children to go to church.  It's easier to be married to someone the same religion as you, trust me.  Even if you are christian, there are so many branches of christianity, you would want someone who is the same as you.<br>  <br>  But, dating is a different story.  It's important while dating to meet all kinds of different people and personalities.  I'm christian, but if I wasn't married, I could date someone who is athiest.  I just probably wouldn't get married to that person because I want my kids to believe in God and go to church and stuff.|`|pmFFVhp2aa	For me, it would be easier to date a Christian, because I'm one. I feel like if I were to date an Atheist, I would always be trying to put my beliefs on them and I don't want to conform anyone to what I believe in if they don't want to... I know we'd end up getting into a lot of arguments over religion. Don't want to do it!|`|FlWubFnhaa	That would depend largely on you.  If you are an atheist, why do you want to date a Christian and vice versa?  Each one has values that could conflict in the romance department.<br>  <br>  I am not holy than thou but would not want to date an theist because I really do not want to be around anyone who thinks man is the highest good.  If there is no God or gods then all we have left is man and his abilities.|`|a5f0410e8f119074238a8fceda8f4787aa	date what your heart tells you to religion should not matter<br>  what matters the most is how you fell about it|`|0MUeOqWoaa	It depends on how YOU believe. if you dont believe in GOD then yeah it would be easier for you to date and atheist. However i dont agree with the first person who answeredd and called atheist loser, thats not true, there still people like you and me and they just really need someone t pray for them! But if you do belive in God then it would not work out between you and an atheist. |`|Hvuqv6duaa	probably a atheist because they'd be more accepting of some stuff, unless you're a christian yourself then it should be alright..|`|TVfDa1OWaa	Depends on the person. I've no problem dating either type in theory, but I wouldn't want to date someone who tried to convert me to their way of thinking.|`|c5lRMPiRaa	it depends on what you are.<br>  if an athiest: then an athiest,<br>  if not: then a christian.|`|CP0CFxzUaa	I've never dated, but for me I think dating an Atheist would be way easier.|`|kSxhkqY2aa	I SOOOOOO AGREE WITH THE FIRST ANSWER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ZyGyDLsDaa	I don't know if this will help. It's the plot summary from Wikipedia:<br>  <br>  While home, Molly hears a banging noise; first from the mail, then from upstairs. She finds her bathroom window open and locks it shut, only to find Jane standing near the doorway with a knife in her hand. Jane explains that her nurse released her because she, too, believes, and reveals that Molly was never meant to live, having died as the result of a miscarriage. She explains that she didn't want to lose another baby and made a deal with a mysterious woman who promised Jane and Robert eighteen years with Molly, at which point she would belong to them. Jane explains that Robert refuses to believe the truth and raises her knife, but Molly throws her against the bathtub and tries to escape. She trips in the hallway, allowing Jane to catch her. After a struggle over the stairs, Molly throws Jane over the railing. Believing her to be dead, Molly gets a closer look to find the knife in Jane's stomach, only for Jane to grab her with her last breath. Robert comes home to find Jane on the floor, and maintains that Jane is delusional, but Molly now knows better and fights off Robert with a marble vase.<br>  Molly runs to the Christian center and begs Alexis to help her. Alexis takes her to the church to baptize Molly, ultimately revealing that her grandmother was one of Jane's nurses at Clayton, and she tries to drown Molly in the holy water. Molly knocks Alexis into the tub wall, where her head cracks. Alexis finds her head is bleeding, and apologizes to Molly before collapsing in the water. Leah swings by Molly's house to drop off a birthday present.<br>  On the way home, Molly is nearly run over by Joseph. She laments her situation to him, but he appears to not believe her and offers to let her go away with him. They share a kiss and he enters his house. Molly calls Dr. Emerson to talk, until she hears the sound of Joseph shout her name and a glass breaking. Molly makes her way through Joseph's house, now appearing less inviting since the party, and finds him in the pool house, along with a cake bearing a single candle. Molly simply wants to leave, but Joseph gives her a sneer. Dr. Emerson then shows up, without having even gotten Molly's phone message. She asks how Molly's "new life" feels, and the voices start up again. Molly realizes that Joseph knew all along what Molly was and had lied about it. Dr. Emerson presses that Molly is the one and that Molly doesn't know how lucky she is to have power. She explains that Molly's parents made the choice to sell her soul to the Devil to save her life. A bloodied Robert is dragged into the building, apologizing, by some strange figures. Robert and Dr. Emerson exchange a brief glance, and in a flashback, it's revealed that Dr. Emerson is the Devil incarnate who offered to save Molly's life that day. Robert pleads with Dr. Emerson to take him instead, and Molly desperately prays for God's forgiveness. Dr. Emerson laughs off their attempts and tells Molly about the pact her parents made, and that it could be broken if Molly kills her father. Robert pleads for Molly to go through with it, and as the clock strikes midnight, Molly raises the knife, but stabs herself several time instead. The effort, however, is in vain, because the clock had already struck midnight.<br>  After the reckoning, one of the doctors at Clayton is relaying a patient's diagnoses of psychosis and paranoia to a woman dressed in all black. The patient is revealed to be Robert, and the visitor is revealed to be a cold-hearted Molly, now a servant of the Devil. When offered to interact with Robert, Molly refuses and curtly tells the doctor that Robert is no longer her father, and this is how it was to be.<br>  The film ends on graduation day at Huntington Prep, with Molly as valedictorian giving her speech about destiny, as Joseph smiles at her. After the ceremony, a flyer for missing children depicting Alexis is on the ground. Molly rejoins Joseph, and they walk past Dr. Emerson, who congratulates Molly and tells her "See you soon."<br>  <br>  You can read the complete summary here:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Haunting_of_Molly_Hartley" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hauntin...</a>

9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	I answered this question a few months ago. here's the answer to your query:<br>  <br>  For many years, several of Dvo?ák's works were lost - even to Dvo?ák himself. These included the first four symphonies (the ones now listed as Nos 1-4) and were not published in his lifetime. The other, later symphonies were published - although not in the order that Dvo?ák composed them (this wasn't so unusual in the 19th century). The first to be published was the one in D major Op 60 (so, then known as 'No 1'). The second to be published was the one in D minor Op 70 (known as 'No 2'). Then came the Symphony in F major Op 76 (known as 'No 3'), the G major Symphony Op 88 ('No 4') and the E minor Symphony ('From the New World') Op 95 (as 'No 5').<br>  <br>  When these missing works resurfaced in the mid-twentieth century, it required a re-numbering of the symphonies to include the four earlier 'lost' ones (new Nos 1-4). This gave the opportunity of listing the five later symphonies in the order they were written (old 3, 1, 2, 4, 5; new 5-9).<br>  <br>  The explanation above gives the reason behind many of Dvo?ák's opus numbers being misleading (high numbers to earlier works, low numbers to later works) - all due to the numbers being assigned at the time of publication rather than at the time of composition.<br>  <br>  I hope this goes some way to explaining the anomaly you asked about.|`|YipD1QKFaa	...a large number of Dvo?ák's works were given opus numbers, these did not always bear a logical relationship to the order in which they were either written or published. To achieve better sales, some publishers such as Simrock preferred to present budding composers as being well established, by giving some relatively early works much higher opus numbers than their chronological order would merit. In other cases, the same opus number was given to more than one of Dvo?ák's works. In yet other cases, a work was given as many as three different opus numbers by different publishers. His symphonies' numbering has also been confused: (a) they were initially numbered by order of publication, not composition; (b) the first four symphonies to be composed were published after the last five; and (c) the last five symphonies were not published in order of composition. This explains why, for example, the New World Symphony was originally published as No. 5, was later known as No. 8, and definitively renumbered as No. 9 in the critical editions published in the 1950s.<br>  <br>  All of Dvo?ák's works were chronologically catalogued by Jarmil Burghauser in Antonín Dvo?ák. Thematic Catalogue. Bibliography. Survey of Life and Work (Export Artia, Prague, 1960). As an example, in the Burghauser catalogue, the New World Symphony, Op. 95 is B.178. [2] Scholars today often refer to Dvo?ák's works by their B numbers (for Burghauser), although references to the traditional opus numbers are still common, in part because the opus numbers have historical continuity with earlier scores and printed programs. The opus numbers are still more likely to appear in printed programs for performances.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Dvorak certainly knew it as his fifth...not all of Dvorak's symphonies were published in his life-time... In my opinion we should stick to Dvorak's publisher's numbering<br>  <br>  Funnily enough I bought an old vinyl recording  of it last week and it was numbered No.5 'from the new world'<br>  <br>  <br>  There ought to be a law against know-all musicologists who think that they know better than the original publishers and the composer!

RggoPHvmaa	On August 25, 2001, at 6:45 pm (EST), just after finishing filming of the music video to "Rock the Boat", Aaliyah and various members of her record company boarded a twin engine Cessna 402B (N8097W) at Marsh Harbour, Abaco Island, Bahamas to travel to Opa-locka Airport near Miami, Florida. The crew had a flight scheduled the next day, but since the video wrapped early, Aaliyah and her entourage were eager to return to the US. Aaliyah's entourage was in a rush to get back to New York so they demanded that their heavy equipment from the shoot be on the plane rather than leave it behind which resulted in the aircraft being well beyond the standard weight and balance tolerance provided by Cessna.[11]<br>  <br>  The plane crashed shortly after takeoff about 200 feet (60 m) from the runway. Aaliyah, pilot Luis Morales III and the seven other passengers, including her hair stylist Eric Forman, Anthony Dodd, her security guard Scott Gallin, Douglas Kratz (a director of video production for Virgin Records), stylist Christopher Maldonado, Keith Wallace and Gina Smith (both employees of the Blackground label) died.[12]<br>  <br>  According to findings from an inquest conducted by the coroner's office in the Bahamas, Aaliyah suffered from "severe burns and a blow to the head", in addition to severe shock. The coroner theorized that, even if Aaliyah had survived the crash, her recovery would have been virtually impossible given the severity of her injuries.[13]<br>  <br>  Aaliyah's funeral was held on August 31, 2001 at Saint Ignatius Loyola Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan, New York City.|`|Y555oe3Haa	In a plane crash.

I think that the "New Moon" director will be 100 times better than the "Twilight" director.

I hate wearing colognes also but love this one.<br>  stay away from sunflowers or poison or anything with too much overpowering lfowers like roses. someone who doesnt like cologne is turned off by something that is based on too much of one thing.<br>  I also realy love curious by britainy spears.

lMbKZ1VUaa	Two men at a bar had been enjoying a few drinks for the past couple of hours and were pretty drunk when one of them notices a beautiful woman sitting in the corner. One says to the other, "Jeez, I'd really like to dance with that girl."<br>  <br>  The other man replies, "Well go ahead and ask her, don't be a chicken."<br>  <br>  So the man approaches the lovely woman and says, "Excuse me. Would you be so kind as to dance with me?"<br>  <br>  Seeing the man is totally drunk the woman says, "I'm sorry. Right now I'm concentrating on matrimony and I'd rather sit than dance."<br>  <br>  So the man humbly returns to his friend.<br>  <br>  "So what did she say?" asks the friend.<br>  <br>  The drunk responded, "She said she's constipated on macaroni and would rather $hit in her pants."<br>  --<br>  Two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He doesn't seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed. The other guy takes out his phone and calls the emergency services. <br>  He gasps: "My friend is dead! What can I do?" The operator says: "Calm down, I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead." There is a silence, then a gunshot is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says: "OK, now what?"<br>  --<br>  Everyone was seated around the table as the food was being served. When little Johnny received his plate, he started eating straight away.<br>  "jonny, wait until we've said our prayer," his mother reminded him.<br>  "I don't have to," the little boy replied.<br>  "Of course you do," his mother insisted. "We say a prayer before eating at our house."<br>  "That's at our house," Johnny explained, "but this is Grandma's house and she knows how to cook."<br>  --<br>  Little Johnny's teacher passed out red lifesavers to all the kids in class as part of her lesson on the 5 senses. She told all the children to use whatever sense of perception they could to figure out the flavor. Some kids smelled them, some pointed out the color, but everyone eventually tasted them. Finally a little girl raised her hand and said, "is it cherry?" "Yes it is" said the teacher. Next she passed out purple grape lifesavers to everyone. The children examined and tasted the candy until a little boy put his hand in the air and announced, "it's grape!" "Good job" said the teacher. For the last one, she passed out yellow honey-flavored lifesavers. All the kids examined, smelled, and tasted the candy, but no one had a guess. The teacher offered a hint. She said, "It's something your mommy and daddy may call you." Little Johnny immediately screamed, "Spit it out everybody, it's asshole!"<br>  --<br>  Little Johnny's kindergarten class was on a field trip to their local police station. There they saw pictures tacked to a big bulletin board. The label clearly read, "The 10 Most Wanted." <br>  <br>  One of the youngsters pointed to a picture and asked if it really was the photo of a wanted person. <br>  <br>  "Yes," said the policeman, "the detectives want him very badly." <br>  <br>  So Little Johnny asked, while tugging on the man's belt, "Um, mister, why didn't you keep them when you took their pictures?"<br>  --<br>  Ms. Brooks was having trouble with one of her first-grade pupils. "Johnny,what is your problem?" Johnny answered, "I'm too smart for the first Grade. My sister is in third grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the third-grade too!"<br>  <br>  Ms. Brooks had had enough, so she took Johnny to the principal's office. The principal agreed that he would give the boy a test and if he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the first-grade and behave.<br>  <br>  He started by asking Johnny some simple arithmetic. "What is three times three?" "Nine, Sir." "How much is nine times six?" "Fifty-four." And so it went with every question the principal thought a third-grade student should know. The principal looked at Ms. Brooks and said, "I think Johnny can go to third grade! He seems smart enough."<br>  <br>  Ms. Brooks said to the principal, "Let me ask him some questions?" The principal and Johnny both agreed. <br>  <br>  Ms. Brooks asked, "What does a cow have four of that I have only two of? Johnny, after a moment, answered "Legs, Ma'am"<br>  <br>  "What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?" "Pockets!"<br>  <br>  "OK,what does a dog do that a man steps into?" "Pants."<br>  <br>  "What starts with a C and ends with a T, is hairy, oval, delicious and contains thin whitish liquid?" "Coconut."<br>  <br>  "What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?" The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer, Johnny was taking charge. "Bubblegum!"<br>  <br>  "What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?" "Shake hands, Ma'am."<br>  <br>  "Now for some 'Who am I' sort of questions, OK? First one: You stick your pole inside me, you tie me down to get me up, and I get wet before you do." Johnny, quick as ever, answered, "Tent!"<br>  <br>  "OK, a finger goes in me. You fiddle with me when you're bored. The best man always has me first." The Principal was looking restless and a bit tense. But Johnny was on the ball with "Wedding Ring!"|`|HyDlROg0aa	you dont deserve my love...|`|5yKDSLAiaa	abraham lincoln george bush and bill clinton were all in a cruise boat when it started to sink. lincoln said we have to get the women and children to safter bush said screw the women and children, and clinton said do we have time?|`|FAu1zLUFaa	go to this website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8kThoZpF_U" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8kThoZpF...</a>

Grrr! <br>  <br>  If you read any of his interviews, you'll see he's actually a really funny guy. Not forgetting that he also prevented a massive fire at Reading Festival not so long ago!<br>  Pete = Ledge!|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Scum.<br>  <br>  He was a promising talent when he was in the Libertines but he f**ked that up big time with his constant drug use and arsey behaviour.<br>  <br>  He's done nothing of note since, apart from starting a crap band (Babyshambles) and falling into bed and into rehab with various equally scummy women.<br>  <br>  As for genius - don't make me laugh. Pete is 29 years old and is a mediocre, washed-up druggie musician who has done nothing useful with his life. He's clearly a very intelligent and articulate guy (he was offered a place at Oxford University, and you don't get that if you're thick), but he's made no real use of that intelligence and he'll be a prime candidate for "where are they now" status in a few years time.<br>  <br>  When John Lennon was 29, he was a member of the biggest band in the world and had recorded albums such as Sgt Peppers, the White Album and Abbey Road, which continue to enthrall and entertain music lovers even today. Yes, the Beatles used tons of drugs but they were smart enough not to let the drugs f**k them up and rule their lives.<br>  <br>  Now tell me who qualifies for the label of "genius"?|`|8BHJ1obLaa	Peter has chosen the life he wants, and that is his choice at the end of the day, in my own opinion he is a silly little person, and will live to regret what he is doing to his body and mental health.

Most Kaningara speak English, tok-pidgin (which has many English loan words), as well as their Native language Kaningara (after all, Papua New Guinea used to be a British Colony). Sorry to burst your bubble, but missionaries have been living in the most remote regions of the world since the late 19th century. (Typically, however, the Kaningara retain their tribal surnames, e.g. Patrick Semai)|`|pSvIRtHCaa	Ladies- Papua New Guinea was colonized both the British and Australia- many people speak English there.  this show is real and the host is actually an anthropologist who was trained to travel and research. <br>  <br>  They are not actors.

AA12269023	Jonas Bros...<br>  (I mean c'mon, Joe was wearing a PINK leather jacket..)|`|wnCQPYRmaa	Maybe its just me but I find that a lot of hip/hop and rap artists dress really gay. I know that they are metrosexuals but some of them seem to cross that fine line over to the 'other' side, and quite often too.|`|BuwXOXiiaa	The Jonas Brothers.

So I guess i'm Team Selena and Demi!|`|uEsGB9zDaa	miley and mandy, i would choose selena and demi but SELENA is a loser who cant act or sing so give it up. they win by far and demi and loser videos and stupid and are always talking about how much they love each other|`|rMavIPMeaa	demi and selena. im not a big selena person, but i like demi's music and her tv show, plus i hate miley and mandy isnt even famous|`|N4wj8JFDaa	Wow, I'm probably gonna be one of the very few people saying this but, I don't choose sides.

ePvvGUu3aa	Both Saw 3 and Saw 4 are happening at the same time and as you know, Jigsaw is dead at the ending of both. In Saw 3, you see his first accomplice Amanda, who is also killed, but showed more to it during Saw 3. At the end of Saw 4, you see that Hoffman is an accomplice of Jigsaw also. During Saw 5, you will notice flash backs explaining the story of Hoffman's sister and how she was murdered by her boyfriend. Then later finding out that Hoffman murdered the boyfriend, but then was blamed on by Jigsaw. Jigsaw told him that wasn't his style and he gives people chances and told Hoffman he can redeem himself. <br>  <br>  Remember in Saw 3 how the husband and wife (doctor) were involved with Jigsaw and Amanda and if the husband forgave Jigsaw, the game would be won and their daughter would be set free? Also, remember how Strahm is locked in the room, but finds his way out then gets in the trap he is set up to? Everyone in that place from Saw 3 and to Strahm are supposed to be dead, so Hoffman can be the "hero" and redeem himself by being the only one left survived who saved the daughter from Saw 3. Later to find that Strahm was still alive, he would keep hunting for the accomplice, etc.<br>  <br>  I hope I answered thoroughly and helped you understand the movie more.|`|1JrL80Z2aa	jigsaw dies in saw iv, his partner is reveiled.<br>  In saw v his partner cuts off jigsaws face & "plays games" like in the previous 4 movies.<br>  There will be a saw iv,iiv & on <br>  when I am 90 saw xxc will come out.(I can't wait) lol |`|AA10065077	I'm not really sure what you are asking for soI'll just do a sum up of the entire movies. I agree the movies get confusing. In the first Saw movie we are introduced to this killer named Jigsaw and he likes to kill people by giving them means of escape. The only person to escape was Amanda. In the second Saw movie expanded on the jigsaw character more. Amanda from the first movie is planted in the house. In the third is when we learn that Amanda is Jigsaw's accomplince and both Jigsaw and Amanda are killed. Saw 4 is taking place the same time as Saw 3 so please keep that in mind when watching it. We also learn that Hoff man is also an apprentice of Jigsaw at the end of Saw 4.  In Saw 5 we see flash backs of Hoffman and Jigsaw. Hoffman killed her sister's boyfriend and it was blamed on the Jigsaw killer.It has been confirmed there will be a Saw 6.

JotdiI3zaa	Normal breathing involves a shallow inhalation and an even exhalation followed by a pause before it all starts again. But when you sing, breath control means taking your breathing off autopilot. You not only need to inhale quickly and exhale slowly as you sing the phrases of a song, but you also need to maintain proper posture.<br>  <br>  Breathing in this manner provides you with the breath control that you need to sing efficiently. However, because controlled breathing doesn't come naturally to you, you need to train your body to breathe for singing. Keep reading to walk through the breathing basics. <br>  <br>  Discovering your singing breath<br>  The easiest way to find out how you should breathe for singing is simply by feeling it. Being able to visualize and feel the proper way to breathe helps make the process more natural for you, too.<br>  <br>   Inhalation refers to air moving into your body — breathing in. Exhalation is when you exhale or blow out the air. You exhale when you speak or sing. <br>   <br>  <br>  Inhaling to sing<br>  Singing songs requires getting a full breath quickly — a quick inhalation — because the orchestra can't wait five minutes for you to find the air. So knowing how your body feels when you inhale helps you to get air in your body quickly to sing the next phrase. Use the following exercise to explore your own inhalation. Get a feel for how your body should move when you inhale and exhale.<br>  <br>  1. Pretend that air is really heavy as you inhale. Visualize it weighing 50 pounds and let it fall low into your body.<br>  <br>  2. Let it fall lower than your belly button. Explore this sensation.<br>  <br>  3. Then let the breath fall in faster. Still visualize it being heavy but let it fall quickly into your body.<br>  <br>  4. You can also fill your lungs as if you were going to blow up a balloon. You will feel your abdomen and lower back expand.<br>  <br>  This sensation of quickly filling your lungs with air is how you properly inhale for singing.<br>  <br>   Yawning happens all the time when working on breath control. The body gets confused with the different amount of air coming in, and you yawn. Voice students yawn plenty during lessons and are embarrassed at first. Don't worry — it's okay to yawn when you're working on your breathing. <br>   <br>  <br>  Exhaling to sing <br>  Singing means that you have to control your exhalation. You want to have a sustained and smooth exhalation. This control helps you to sing those demanding high notes and long slow phrases.<br>  <br>  To explore exhalation, blow a feather around the room. If you have a spotless house, you'll have to use an imaginary feather.<br>  <br>  1. Try to blow the feather really high up in the air and use a long stream of breath to get it to go up.<br>  <br>  2. Try not to collapse your chest as you blow the feather.<br>  <br>  3. While chasing the feather with your breath, notice what moves in your body as you exhale. You should feel that your abdomen has slowly returned to normal and that your chest has stayed in the same position the whole time.<br>  <br>  4. At the end of the exhalation, you should feel the need to immediately inhale again. <br>  <br>  Posturing yourself for breathing<br>  Breathing efficiently when you sing is a combination of great posture and skillful inhaling and exhaling. Remember the importance of good posture; it allows you to get a deep, full breath. If you slouch or you're too rigid, your diaphragm locks and prevents you from getting a correct breath for singing. If your breathing and your posture work together as a team, you can improve your singing.<br>  <br>  To sing your best, you want to develop good posture while you breathe. When your body is aligned correctly, taking and using an efficient breath is easier.<br>  <br>   Your own two hands can help you to maintain great posture while breathing. As you work through the breathing exercises, place one hand on your chest and the other hand on your abs. As you inhale, use your hand to feel whether your chest stays steady; you want it to stay in the same position for both the inhalation and the exhalation. (If your chest rises during inhalation, you create tension in your chest and neck.) With your other hand, feel it moving out with your abs as you inhale and back in toward your body as you exhale. <br>   <br>  <br>  Positioning your body to feel breath<br>  Different body positions also help you to feel your breath movement. Moving through different positions can help you feel the movement of breath.<br>  <br>  Start flat on the floor and gradually work your way up to standing. It's great to work your breath on the floor, but you can't perform on the floor. You have to get up sometime and breathe correctly, so it may as well be right away. By starting out on the floor, you're able to totally focus on breathing and the movements in your body. By gradually working your way up, you can continue exploring the same movement of breath while working your way up to standing. Some singers have trouble finding the right movement for breathing when they stand. When they begin on the floor, they often find a sense of release in thei

Well, we are in talks with a major Hollywood production company at the moment, but it’s the earliest possible stage, so there’s no script yet, or any plans for a release date.

But I promise I’ll keep you all posted if I get any more news.<br>  <br>  Later in the chat, Holmes stated:<br>  <br>      Which animation studio is working on the Warriors movies? We’re not at this stage yet, I’m afraid.

mEe6jNyoaa	sinceramente non ho nulla contro di loro.... sono i fan che si rendono ridicoli.... <br>  <br>  certo, hanno uno stile un po' particolare, ma non è questo il motivo per cui non li apprezzo...<br>  <br>  purtroppo anche mia sorella è una stata una fan dei tokio hotel... e la cosa che mi da fastidio è proprio il fatto che abbia improvvisamente abbandonato la sua passione per la band quando questi sono passati di moda....<br>  <br>  e odio anche il fatto che pronunci la frase "io adoro il rock" ma che non sappia neppure cosa sia il rock....<br>  <br>  personalmente, mi stanno antipatici i fan, non il gruppo....<br>  <br>  e comunque credo siano più stolti coloro che criticano le loro canzoni spesso senza averle mai ascoltate....|`|9zau5jIsaa	Ciao,<br>  Io li ho ascoltati e non mi piacciono.<br>  La situazione sarebbe questa se non fosse per il fatto che sono inseguiti da orde di fan che li fanno diventare insopportabili, cioè ogni 2 x 3 su Answer c'è una loro domanda, continuano a rompere parlando solo di loro, non conoscono altro e li portano all'estremo. Grazie a questo i tokio hotel sono ai primi posti quando esce un nuovo singolo, appena uscirà il nuovo disco le radio trasmetterà solo quello, etc.<br>  Con tutta questa fama loro sono anche diventati ridicoli spuntando ogni volta su qualche rivista per ragazzine con delle interviste ridicole del tipo: "Ma voi avete mai fatto sesso?".<br>  <br>  Magari per te non sono malaccio, magari al mondo esistono anche gruppi peggiori, ma non vedo perchè dovrei ascoltarli quando in giro c'è di meglio<br>  <br>  Ciao!<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Ah gia poi mi da anche fastidio il fatto che la loro musica sia fatta da altri, se volessero veramente suonare le cose se le dovrebbero scrivere da soli|`|20Je1lBPaa	Dunque io li odio a morte, perchè stanno a fare un mucchio di soldi ma senza fare niente di nuovo, di originale, di loro; la stragrande maggioranza delle canzoni è plagiata, se non tutta almeno in parte, ma copiano da brani degli anni 90, cantano in una lingua che nemmeno conoscono e quindi i testi non li fanno loro<br>  Sono dei pupazzi in pratica, potrebbe esserci chiunque al loro posto, e si sono venduti completamente alle case discografiche: se noti le foto vecchie e quelle recenti, le case per contratto gli hanno stravolto tutto, il loro stile di musica, e il loro look.<br>  Una band studiata in laboratorio per vendere dischi ai poveri 14enni ignari che non sono vecchi abbastanza da conoscere le canzoni che plagiano.|`|I0zyOm2Saa	questa è una bella domanda<br>  allora......<br>  1 questi 4 sono stati creati appositamente per far soldi e fott.ere le menti dei ragazzini di oggi<br>  2 ma li hai visti????? Sembrano fatti col pennarello infatti i 2 diciamo leader portanti del gruppo (quei due gemelli) hanno un look mooolto diverso dato che uno e un ''rocker/emo'' e l'altro uno pseudorapper mentre se noti gli altri due hanno un look totalmente anonimo e stanno sempre nascosti; tutto questo per esaltare la ''bellezza di bill e tom<br>  3 La coerenza! Mio Dio non sanno una parola di inglese e lo cantano cosa che ci fa pensare che i testi non li scrivano loro ma che vengono scritti a tavolino da un gruppo di produttori apposta per le ragazzina che entrano nell'età chiave (12,13,14)<br>  4 e ultimo punto:La musica non si fà in questo modo! La musica è amore,passione e rabbia,voglia di far capire qualcosa al mondo,di lanciare un messaggio! Non è scrivere 4 canzoncine con la stessa base e lo stesso tempo solo perchè piacciono alle ragazze della famigerata età chiave! E con questo non mi riferisco solo ai tokio hotel ma a tantissimi altri gruppi! <br>  Con questo chiudo sperando che le varie fan dei tokio hotel non vengano a mettermi il pollice in giù solo perchè ho espresso un opinione peraltro senzata|`|XUyQ1VS3aa	No...hai sbagliato...la musica viene totalmente prodotta dal produttore...mentre il chitarrista avrà avuto solo qualche idea...<br>  Non fidarti delle cose che leggi nelle riviste per teenager...davvero non fidarti, sono fatte apposta per far vendere gruppi...<br>  <br>  La mia opinione ? <br>  Sono semplicemente un gruppo fatto a tavolino...dicono di venir influenzati da Ac-Dc e Motley Crue (forse per il trucco ? =| ) e allo stesso tempo da Linkin Pork e Green Day (questi con loro missa proprio che c'entrano =| ) che non c'entrano una mazza con i primi...<br>  Li spacciano per alternative band, quando poi sono solo un prodotto commerciale...non so se hai avuto la sfortuna di ascoltare i primi album (io purtroppo si)...<br>  <br>  P.S:<br>  Non tirate fuori il fatto che fanno musica con il pc...ormai tutti gli artisti affermati fanno musica con i pc, anche perchè tutti gli studio ne dispongono 1(se non 2) con diversi monitor...provare per credere....<br>  <br>  Ancora P.S:<br>  Ti sei risposta da sola comunque...perchè traducono le canzoni?<br>  Per aumentare il successo =|<br>  I Rammstein hanno fatto un album completamente in inglese?<br>  non mi pare...|`|UZjIKqwHaa	Ma infatti sono proprio le fan che li rendono ridicoli... è per quello che mi danno fastidio... perchè a me loro erano indifferenti... poi mi da fastidio quando articoli di giornali, fan e altri li definiscono rock... -_- la voce di bill non sarà male (e questo lo ammetto) ma per il resto... non mi piacciono anche perchè... assoli non ne ho mai sentiti... insomma non mi piacciono... ciao!|`|enTV6zktaa	finalmente una persona intelligente SUL SERIO.<br>  per conto mio gli anti che attaccano in tutti i modi questo gruppo valgono quanto le fan esagerate e solo chi non li sopporta ma non li attacca e chi li ascolta ma è pronto riconoscerne i difetti è un piu evoluto.<br>  Sono persone normalissime, hanno pregi e difetti anche loro. Impariamo a vederli tutti e due.|`|48Ffj6yMaa	mi chiedo chi veramente conosca i loro lavori per definirli schifosi....<br>  ridicoli siete<br>  ah, a me comunque sembra che su answer ci sia più gente che idolatra i guns n roses che hanno fatto 1 disco e mezzo in carriera, e che ci sia molta più gente che apre domande sui tokyo hotel per insultarli...manco fossero assassini o dittatori in guerra|`|khylYVRbaa	mah,i brani glielo scriveranno<br>  secondo me non sono tanto interessati a fare musica...<br>  loro hanno capito l'essenza della vita -.- : i soldi (ironico)<br>  vedi bill,che dicono tutti quanti che assomiglia ad una femmina ecc.?<br>  secondo me lo fa apposta,perchè sà che quel look attira ragazzine ochette starnazzanti.<br>  è più uomo di tutti quanti.<br>  per quel che riguarda la musica...fanno abbastanza schifo|`|4nCmJXhoaa	A me la loro musica fa veramente SCHIFO....io ascolto sempre: Guns N' Roses, Led Zeppelin, AC DC e gruppi che fanno musica, non "rumore" come quei 4 cretini, che il cantante si veste pure da femmina....non posso ancora crederci che non siano ancora falliti e andati a vivere in mezzo alla strada....e spero che quel giorno avvenga presto....|`|gKzfye8Naa	SECONDO ME LA LORO MUSICA E STANCANTE CMQ ANK IO HO UNA SORELLA DI 14ANNI KE AMA I TOKIO HOTEL.IO OGNI GIORNO SENTO LA LORO MUSICA XK ANK MIA SORELLA LA METTE A TUTTO VOLUME LA CANZONE E IO GLI SBATTO LA PORTA IN FACCIA !

Ho letto anche i testi per i motivi del tedesco e guarda... c'è di meglio, mooolto meglio... se vogliamo parlare di musica tedesca... c'è mooolto meglio, sia per i testi, sia per la qualità (soprattutto di questa) della musica. Un esempio ? Volete mettere la canzone dei tokio hotel, la famosa "Rette mich", con questa "Rette mich" ? Guarda qua... <a href="http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=LoKvpp-D0ZU" rel="nofollow">http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=LoKvpp-D0Z...</a><br>  <br>  E i testi sono molto più accurati di quelli dei Tokio Hotel:<br>  <br>  Komm berühre mich<br>  Ich verliere mich<br>  Denn ich spüre dich<br>  Rette mich<br>  <br>  Ich erkenne dich<br>  Und verrenne mich<br>  Deshalb brenne ich<br>  Rette mich<br>  <br>  Für all die jahre<br>  Die uns enteilen<br>  Für all die wunden<br>  Die nie verheilen<br>  <br>  Komm und n?hre mich<br>  Und vermehre dich<br>  Ich verzehre mich<br>  Rette mich<br>  <br>  Es verschlimmert sich<br>  Ich erinner mich<br>  Blute innerlich<br>  Rette mich<br>  <br>  Für all die tr?ume<br>  Die uns entgleiten<br>  Für all die ?ngste<br>  Die sich verbreiten<br>  <br>  Komm und erl?se<br>  mich von mir<br>  Komm und erl?se mich<br>  <br>  Für all die jahre<br>  Die uns enteilen<br>  Für all die wunden<br>  Die nie verheilen<br>  Für all die tr?ume<br>  Die uns entgleiten<br>  Für all die ?ngste<br>  Die sich verbreiten<br>  <br>  Mentre i Tokio Hotel mettono due parole in croce, nel senso (visto che le strofe sono molto più lunghe...) senza alcun significato ... e non voglio annoiarti sul fatto che li odio per ciò che dice Pino Scotto che in parte ha ragione (apparte il fatto che sono gay...ma per il fatto della musica e che sono "stati disegnati" si...)|`|M9eElSgMaa	quello che sto per dire non voglio che venga frainteso:<br>  i tokio hotel non riesco a sopportarli perchè li ho ormai associati ad una cerchia di persone e cose che non mi appartengono per niente...quindi quando li senti mi fanno venre alla mente un sacco di cose che mi infastidiscono e non riesco a sentirli. non ce l'ho CON LORO, ma con chi ha costruito tutta quella muraglia di vaccate intorno a loro. il fatto che tua sorella sia così fanatica mi fa pensare che li stima e in questo non c'è niente di male! :D anzi, è bene che le piaccia qualcuno così tanto, ma io non ci riesco...<br>  non me la prendo con chi li adora  e ba sta ma con quelli che ci costruiscono tutte quelle robe false. <br>  <br>  quelli invece che non sopporto anche solo dal modo di fare sono i Jonas Brother, quelli si e non so proprio perchè...imprinting all'odio?

c12e2903577b3cad0d35875d25c3d663aa	Io lo seguo e parecchie persone che conosco lo seguono, non sono una ragazzina infatti penso che il grande fratello ma soprattutto Amici siano seguiti più dai ragazzini.<br>  X Factor non è un vero e proprio reality (è un talent show con poche liti stile Amici), più per chi ha la passione della musica e credo che trovino dei veri e propri talenti, cantanti con la c maiuscola.<br>  Non amo Simona Ventura ma il programma è veramente interessante............la cosa bella è che non si scannano tra cantanti e non si perdono in litigi inutili per fare audience.<br>  Enrico mi piace moltissimo, penso che anche nella seconda puntata canterà "Don't leave me this way" meravigliosamente......mi piace moltissimo anche Ambra Marie.|`|Z13neqAlaa	Mi piace molto e lo guardavo già dalla scorsa edizione, però, in verità, sono contenta che non se ne parli eccessivamente e non lo facciano diventare un fenomeno mediatico.<br>  Pensa se cominciassero a fare decine di domande ogni 10 minuti come fanno per Amici ( che a me, sinceramente hanno un pò rotto), probabilmente inizierei ad odiarlo e a non volerne più sentir parlare.<br>  Detto questo, non credo che nessuno lo segua, anzi... :-)|`|SmPjnklzaa	io è l'unico reality a cui ho detto di si (a parte popstars e superstar tour), sinceramente non amo i realty dove le persone vengono messe in una casa a non far nulla, oppure vip messi alla fame che si scannano o ancora peggio certi reality che arrivano dall'america come quello della tata o degli adolescenti o delle spose extralarge che cercano di entrare nel vestito extrasmall.<br>  A me piace, anche se spesso e volentieri ci sono delle esagerazioni, e alcune situazioni sono già viste, però devo dire che sono contento che sia arrivato alla seconda edizione, dopo il flop di superstar tour non pensavo che i reality canori tornassero visto nessuno osava più sfidare "Amici", ma sopratutto non arrivò mai "Pop idol"(il progenitore di x factor) che ci era stato promesso...al suo posto arrivò "Music farm"<br>  Poi ha già fatto lo share necessario è risaputo che contro il grande fratello nulla si può ma x factor ora fa ascolti quindi chi lo vuole lo segua.|`|UKL3BWnKaa	Non mi piace...è la brutta copia della brutta copia della brutta copia di Amici....si vede chiaramente.....solo che Amici da un punto di vista dello "scoprire talenti" è molto moooo000OOOO000ooolto più professionale cn veri professionisti del settore....<br>  A x factor invece? Simona Ventura nn centra niente...Morgan come cantante fa sckifo al massimo esponente (ma sa cantare??? qndo era cn i Bluvertigo faceva skifo skifo)....e poi Mara Maionchi che forse è l'unica che ci capisce qlkosa li dentro dato che è l'unica che nella vita fa la scovatrice di talenti (è lei che ha lanciato Tiziano Ferro!)....|`|OUyW7fwPaa	Io preferisco di gran lunga X Factor a tutti gli altri reality,mi piace anche amici,ma il grande fratello lo odio.Ancora non ho un mio cantante preferito,ci sono molti dotati,spero sinceramente che non esca un' altra Giusy perché io non l'ho mai sopportata ed ho sempre preferito lo stile degli Aram che adoro!|`|H11eGKkJaa	anche a me piace x factor, e visti gli ascolti non siamo gli unici... mi hanno colpito molti cantanti (eccezionali i bastard sons of dioniso), ma lo seguo anche perché i giudici sono tre personalità stravaganti e mi divertono troppo!<br>  credo comunque che il gf resti un reality di massa, molto più facile da essere seguito ed è per questo che riscuote un maggior successo... anche se io lo odio..|`|jhr4eDHqaa	aaaaaaaaaaaaaa io lo odio quel programma!!! purtroppo piace tantissimo alla mia amika .... che però nn ha il pc se no altro che g.f e amici........ lei poi è rimasta fissata di toni dell'anno scorso nn la sopporto più!! a me cmq piacciono di più il G.F e amici!!|`|LGXBiTOyaa	x factor è un programma tt già scritto..sai xkè io c sn stata ai provini ed erano tt una bufala..nn c'era nessuno dei 3 ad ascoltarti..sl una xsn mai vista k aveva una lista d nomi k kiamavaa parte..e sai xkè..ql erano i nomi dei raccomandati..w amici!!|`|9AoWRovTaa	io ho solo sentito che giusy ferreri è diventata famosa grazie a quel programma!però non lo mai seguito.. pensa la prima volta che ho visto il logo ho pensato che era un'altra fondazione TOTAL NONSTOP ACTION la tna del wrestling..

This way no one can take credit for your work. Then send your scripts to as many production companys as you can. There is a one in a million chance a production company will like your script and pay you for your work. If they pay you for your scripts then they will produce it but unless you're a credited filmmaker they will most likely not let you direct your own movie.

gJhwH335aa	Yeah, they are pretty close but there's some storyline didn't make it into the movie. They also don't have that big giant squid and changes the ending in the movie version. I don't really mind though, I mean, it fits well with the direction and the storyline.<br>  <br>  No, I don't think it matters if you are having a backwards experience. I mean, if you think the movie is bad ***, then the graphic novel is beyond that. Many comics fan may think the movie sucks compared to the GN but I think its still a fun and enjoyable experience to see all the characters and the scene being brought out to live by a real actor.<br>  <br>  I give the movie 8 out of 10. Watchmen movie tend to be a hit or missed movie experience. Either the audience love and enjoy the movie, or completely avoiding and hate it.|`|11dGXLchaa	It was softcore gay porn.

laVGEEeraa	These shows have not been released to the general public, so the only place to find them would be pirated.  Of course you open yourself up to potential problems should you get caught buying these.|`|JhN3o7qXaa	Your best bet would be to see if a bit torrent site such as IsoHunt or Pirate Bay have them for you to download.|`|tyRQ1aakaa	try you tube
vexY7Bgvaa	Try them and find out is the simple answer.<br>  <br>  In more detail, I have one of each, I love my Fender amp for the clean tone and the slightly 'driven' sound. However the Marshall has a reputation for amazing overdrive, like you would hear on a rock record.<br>  Marshalls have the name, everyone has heard of them, all the great guitarists use them and they are the biggest name, but this is like choosing a book by its cover. <br>  <br>  Price will likely affect your decision, you might find a great Fender but it costs more than the Marshall you also like, or vice versa. You might find an amazing amp at a great price whos make you hadn't even heard of... <br>  <br>  Get to the shop, try them out. If you can't do that listen to a few examples on youtube or similar. <br>  But remember, for trials use your own guitar and play it yourself. Tone is in the fingers. If you got Hendrix to play through a Fender or a Marshall it would still sound like Him.

AA12145054	A dispute occurred with British Sky Broadcasting over a refusal to assign Channel 6 EPG channel 106 (the position the station had on both NTL and Chorus) on its SkyDigital system, which was used by one of its flagship channels, Sky1 or 105 (a still vacant slot between TG4 and Sky One), next to the other Irish channels. Instead Sky offered to place Channel 6 in the 200s at the bottom of the entertainment category as it was a general entertainment channel, and did not carry any public service remit, this being Sky's justification for placing the four Irish terrestrial channels in positions 101-104, as (unlike NTL or Chorus) they are accountable to Ofcom in the UK rather than the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. The moving of Sky1 would also have been complicated further, as its sister channels Sky2 and Sky3 would also have to be reallocated to new positions. As a result, Channel 6 was launched outside of the Sky package.

q4XUy0Duaa	Jaz-O put Jay Z on when he was a nobody.  He featured Jay Z on his tracks.  Jaz-O, Jay Z and Sauce Money were good friends back in the day, and they eventually formed a group together before the days of Rockafella.  When Damon Dash came around trying to sign all 3 of them, neither Jaz nor Sauce trusted Dame.  Dame wasn't offering Jaz and Sauce much money either so they weren't down with working with Dame nor did they want him managing them, but Jay-Z was and did.  After Jay Z signed with Dame, and he started to get some fame, he sort of left the other two out, and that pissed both of them off.  Jaz-O was pissed off to the point that he quit rap for a while.  When he tried to get back in the game, he looked to Jay Z for help.  He was offering Jay Z beats and had a bunch of concepts for songs, but Jay Z basically took some of his beats and sh*tted on Jaz, the same dude who put Jay Z on when he was nobody.  Jay Z even went so far as to start making diss records about Jaz with a bunch of new Rockafella artists.  So the two went back and forth for a while dissing each other and that's when the beef between the two hit wax.|`|hY4xjTUyaa	JayZ is still around...Jaz-o is a mystery to me...never heard of him...if he exists

uDsXjzwjaa	Yeah I think that's really strange that they are doing that.

Loud enough that the people nextto us heard, and bad enough it made her car mats curl up.  <br>  <br>  Lacking the correct words for such a crime against the natural order of dating and ettiquette, I simply said "I left you something to remember me by...sorry!"<br>  She laughed so hard she cried (although the methane probably didnt hurt the tears any)and one year later, we married.

8ce17986ad6e782a7408c6b5e452fd20aa	Tony's is by far the saddest.  Palmer had kind of run his course on the show (plus Dennis has a new series), but Tony was the supporting rock.......and his entrance in Season 4 was one of the most iconic moments of any show.  I didn't much care for Edgar, and Chappelle's death was mostly for shock value (and it worked).  Plus, I'll say what most are thinking:  Kim's death would be the most welcome.|`|AA10405623	Edgar and Michele were the most disappointing.  In that show, anyone is on the block except for Jack.  I can't wait until next season.|`|b7a9ac475a1aabfeb19921859ce68f72aa	all three had a tearful death. the best i would say was chapelle because you felt bad for him.|`|AA12225325	none 24 sucked.thanks for 2 pts|`|af98e367a12dfc00ed9e3b7779a5d38aaa	none of them i dont like it.  oh yeah thanks for the 2 pts.

AA12306168	Difficult to explain, and doesn't work on smart people: Take a whole suit, probably Hearts. Put them in order (ace, 2, 3,...etc...) and place the pile upside down. Take the first card off the deck, but leave it upside down so no one can see the front, and ask the person: Doublecross, or down? Down means to just put the card down to start another pile (continue useing that pile the whole time), Doublecross means to take the top two cards, swap them, then put them down. Once you have gone through the whole pile, and pick up the new pile, the cards will still be in order!

GNd39Idjaa	Other than what?  The other day I was on the 20 meter band, and I was livid over California's legislators subsidizing the construction of new homes.  I mean, here we are with an international economic crisis and all the world trying to keep banks afloat after a housing glut, and CA legislatures are sabotaging everyone just so they can get a bj from the builders' union.  If you want to keep people employed, use that money to build something else!<br>  <br>  So yeah, I don't know if I was on the same band as you or another one, but I was hating.  And I personally don't mind if people hate on other bands.  Doesn't affect me at all if it's not the band I'm on.|`|hJP9y6kjaa	Well... I'm tired of thirteen year old kids saying that My Chemical Romance is, like, omg the best band ever - they're so hardcore!<br>  <br>  Y'know, it's one thing to state your opinion, and it's another to just "hate" on a band ... but it's a whole 'nother kettle of fish to call a turd a turd... (if you'll excuse the expression) ... and yeah, the Jonas brothers, My Chemical Romance, Paramore, all those bands that are marketed to teeny-boppers are crap, from a musical standpoint - completely generic, nothing new.<br>  <br>  It's one thing to have your opinion, it's another for it to be right.<br>  <br>  Saul|`|Catsy82Caa	yeah i agree. it's kinda like jokes about george w. bush. yeah, he's not the best leader or public speaker, but is that any reason to constantly belittle his intelligence and him as a human being? it just stops being funny and becomes really hateful and mean. and i'm getting tired of hearing people talk crap about the jonas brothers/miley cyrus and such. yeah, i get it. you don't like it.|`|kFOxlebDaa	I like what I like and you like what you like.<br>  They are so quick to get pissed off when you have an opinion on what they like though.<br>  Its annoying!

LNnP3oAgaa	Well Im an Aries and Im far from arrogant.  I cant stand arrogant people.  I can have a bad temper though!|`|bXL9937haa	I think that a lot of it is pride. Aries think of being #1. This possibly makes them come off as arrogant.|`|9azX3N4Laa	It depends on that Aries because they are all different. But for the general Aries i would use words like assertive, aggressive, pushy, energic, bold, champion. Leos are more on the arrogant side. Aries just take action in all their doings and is the natural leader. Where it takes time for others to react Aries acts instantly.|`|J4cSgIreaa	Arrogant......? Us Aries...No Way lol!!<br>  <br>  I am not even sure if i am an Aries or Taurus but i am far from arrogant, as with everyone i can have a temper but i am also patient. My Birthday falls on April 20th so it is right on the cusp or aries and taurus and it is sometimes classed as A, other times T. Needless to say i get a little confused sometimes but definately not arrogant!|`|c7XrBgz2aa	yes we are a little arogant to find out more about aries go to yahoo kids or zodiac girls|`|xTb8u783aa	possable|`|jrmvEmEKaa	Yup very arrogant but it not a bad thing, Aries are strong and spicy so they do give off that arrogant vibe, it kinda a pride thing. :)|`|WvnZWYpVaa	Yes (:
rXlyHk1Raa	Of these songs: Mechanix<br>  <br>  Of these bands: Metallica<br>  <br>  Edit: Thanks|`|12QJ9QMRaa	Like em both.<br>  <br>  Mechaniz was more thrashy, faster, but the lyrics were just plain DUMB.<br>  Imagine you were at my station<br>  And you brought your motor to me<br>  Your a burner yeah a real motor car<br>  Said you wanna get your order filled<br>  Made me shiver when I put it in<br>  Pumping just won't do ya know luckily for you<br>  Whoever thought you'd be better<br>  At turning a screw than me<br>  I do it for my life<br>  Made my drive shaft crank<br>  Made my pistons bulge<br>  Made my ball bearing melt from the heat<br>  We were shifting hard when we took off<br>  Put tonight all four on the floor<br>  When we hit top end you know it feels to slow<br>  I'm giving you my room service<br>  And ya know it's more than enough<br>  Oh one more time ya know I'm in love <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvinbRfIo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlvinbRf...</a><br>  <br>  4 Horseman, while I don't exactly consider it the deepest lyrics ever recorded..well, I like the slower tempo and chunkier sound.  Plus..Cliff Burton's bassline is about 100x better than the one for Mechanix. (shocker there)  The bassline sounds too..idk..mechanical on the Megadeth version.<br>  <br>  Plus..James vocals or Daves? C'mon.<br>  <br>  I just think the Metallica version sounds HEAVIER, and I prefer that to pure speed any day .<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyq55YzJY3o&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyq55YzJY...</a><br>  <br>  I admit I do in general prefer Metallica though, period.  But I have also been a huge Megadeth fan since 87, back when almost no one was giving Megadeth any love, so I am not as biased as one might assume.<br>  I would hold RIP up there as one of the finest Thrash albums ever written.<br>  <br>  But, In general, until Mustaine met Marty Friedman, I jsut think he was always playing catchup to where Metallica was (heck... he even thinks so, if you caught his self pity intervies on Some Kind of Monster)<br>  <br>  I find it so funny to hear (mostly) from people who were not even alive during the 80s about how much better Megadeth is...and yet MOST (not all obviously) who lived through it actually disagree.  Apples and Oranges.  Aside from Mustaine having been in both I think it is a truly played out little drama.<br>  <br>  I mean heck..like one band or the other, or like em both?  Why do fans of one so often gotta talk crap about the other?  Do they think by crap talking Metallica they are gonna get a pat on the head and a cookie from Dave?|`|L4jMOVvPaa	they are both brilliant but i do hav to say that mechanix is better as i love faster heavier stuff, although metallicas version has the added bit its just to slow for my personel preference. im not sayin i dont like slow stuff, its that when im listening to metal thats just not what i want to hear.|`|Zxl8oyIraa	METALLICA. also i have never heard mechanix. this will always be an ongoing battle. no one will change their minds. bad news for the megadeth people though, THERE ARE WAY MORE METALLICA FANS. put that in your peace pipe and smoke it.|`|adLSRFrZaa	I like both versions.  I prefer the Metallica version more, but I must say that the Megadeth version is Awesome!  I like how it is faster.|`|eEoeURDHaa	Mechanix<br>  <br>  Megadeth.|`|7Doy5z89aa	I'd say The Mechanix, although I much prefere Metallica to Megadeth, even though there both awsome. :) I've seen them both live and there both amazing. :)

You also don't get the amount of points you see in the game, you get the number you see on the bottom.  For instance in the Pyramid Solitaire I might get 15,000 for my score, but you only get 100 points for every 5 sets you clear, so I might only have 400 points that I earn.<br>  <br>  The games are fun, and free, to me it is a bonus that I receive points for having fun.|`|8SW6RUMtaa	So Do Mine, And Sandy, You're So Right They Are Very Addicting.

Seeing as Harry Potter is closer, you should try going to the movie theater you intend on seeing it at and ask for the tickets to their first or midnight showing in about 2 or 3 months. Same thing with New Moon (Twilight). Always try the month before it's release.

AA10148336	Variation 1<br>  The first player is chosen by having each player roll one die. The highest roll is the first player to start. At the beginning of each turn, the player throws all six six-sided dice. If any dice are not lying flat or on the playing surface, they (only the dice not laying flat or on the playing surface) must be thrown over again. After each throw some or all of the points possible must be taken, setting aside each die that is counted. To continue, all of the die not counted must be thrown again. At each throw, points must be made or the turn ends. When no points are scored in a throw, this is called farkle.<br>  <br>  When a player reaches at least 350 points in a turn and decides to stop, the points for the turn are added to their total score. A player with no points may not end his turn until he has rolled a total of 1000 points in the round.<br>  <br>  The points of each throw are counted separately. When only one die remains, the player has three throws to get points (either a one or a five spot). When all six die have points, all six die are thrown again.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  Variation 2<br>  Everyone starts out "off the table." Each player collects points during his turn, which he may add to his total, or not, depending on how aggressively or cautiously he plays. <br>  To begin a turn if the player is "off the table," he rolls all six dice. <br>  As he rolls during his turn, the player is looking to score points, in the form of Sets (see figure below). <br>  If a roll scores any points, he may set aside each Set he wants to claim points from, and either: <br>  roll all remaining dice, hoping to score additional Sets. <br>  or if all six dice are put aside into Sets, roll all six dice again, hoping to score additional Sets. <br>  or pass play to the next player, if he deems the chance of failure to be too great. <br>  If a roll scores no points, the player forfeits the points scored that turn, and play is passed to the next player. <br>  For a player who is "on the table," he may start by either: <br>  rolling all six dice as described above, <br>  or picking up the rollable dice from the last person. In this case, instead of starting this turn's scoring from zero, as usual, scoring starts from the score of the last person. <br>  example: Player 1 stops his turn with 700 points, and opts to not roll his remaining two dice. He adds 700 to his score, and it is now Player 2's turn. Player 2 may pick up those two dice, and if he scores anything with them, he adds those points to 700, as his score. Or Player 2 may opt to start with all six dice, and start his own scoring from zero.<br>  <br>  At the end of a turn, <br>  If, after rolling, a player is "off the table," and he has scored at least 500 in a turn, he is "on the table." <br>  If by this point, a player is "on the table," he can add whatever score he got that turn, to his total. <br>  <br>  copied and pasted from source home.houston.rr.com/agrant/farkle/farkle|`|AA11358805	im sorry  i have never heard of that game|`|AA11046024	Farkel <br>   <br>  a family dice gameFarkel (or "Farkle") is the name of a family dice game, purportedly of Texas origin, and if so, named after the farkleberry.

They are 'atomic,' that is, you cannot put together sets as you are expected to in Yahtzee. That is, if you set aside a 1, and then two other 1's, you cannot claim the score of triple-1's. You can only claim the score of a single 1, plus the scores of two single 1's.<br>  <br>  a single 1 : 100<br>  a single 5 : 50<br>  triple of 1's : 1000<br>  triple of 2's : 200<br>  triple of 3's : 300<br>  triple of 4's : 400<br>  triple of 5's : 500<br>  triple of 6's : 600<br>  four-of-a-kind : 2x the score of three-of-a-kind<br>  five-of-a-kind : 4x the score of three-of-a-kind<br>  six-of-a-kind : 8x the score of three-of-a-kind<br>  full house : 1000<br>  three pair : 2500<br>  two triples : 3500<br>  small straight (length 5) : 1000<br>  large straight (length 6) : 2000<br>  <br>  <br>  Winning<br>  For a good hour of play with five or six people, you might play to 50,000 points.<br>  <br>  When the first player crosses that threshold, all other players get one more chance to top that player's score. If a player can, then that player wins. Otherwise, the first player to cross that threshold is the winner.|`|AA11916657	6 dice<br>  each "1" is worth 100 pts  each "5" worth 50<br>  three 2's = 200 pts <br>  three 3's = 300 pts<br>  three 4's = 400 pts  etc.<br>  three 1's = 1000 pts<br>  each additional number doubles the total    i.e. four 3's = 600 pts<br>  five 3's doubles again to 1200 pts<br>  four 1's doubles to 2000 pts, five doubles again to 4000 pts<br>  those combinations have to be rolled in one roll--no accumulating to get more of the same number.<br>  Roll all 6 dice and take out the ones that give points.<br>  For example, the roll produces 2,2,5,6,1,1<br>  the points produced are from the 1, 1, and 5 for 250 pts.<br>  those are removed and the remaining three are rolled again if desired.  they are rolled and produce (for example) 3,5,6.<br>  The only die producing points is the 5 for 50 pts.  It is removed and tho other two are rolled--again, if desired.  You can stop at any time.  If they are rolled and they produce 3,6--no points and all points for the turn are lost.--that's why you want to stop--unless you are ambitious, crazy, aggressive, etc.<br>  Also, if when rolling all six dice they produce 1,2,3,4,5,6==a score of 1500 is given and all dice can be rolled again.<br>  Your turn continues until either the player stops or the rolled dice produce no points.  If the player stops, the points anr added to previous score.  If rolled dice produce no points, all points for that turn are lost.<br>  We usually play to 10,000 and you have to get at least 750 before you can begin to accumulate a running score.|`|AA12305754	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkel" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkel</a>

However it also depends on what guitar you have and what pick-up are in it. I would personally get a peevy triple X head if you have the money. If you have the money for that though you would be better off buying a rack just look on zzounds they should have a good rack for a nice price and also you need to look at what cab you have or are planning to get I would stick with marshal. This also depends on the music you play but a rack or a triple X should fit all most all styles. But do not buy a cheap head like a line 6 you will want to upgrade latter it is a waste of money.|`|AA10829907	wish i could help, have no idea what it is even though my bro plays guitar(hes VERY good by the way) but i guess its pretty good.did i answer that correctly?|`|90c0696b7cabaea78c80769781d6c4fcaa	Don't waste your money on transistors and printed circuits.

AA11553052	The Shen Gong Wu are fictional mystical artifacts possessing magical powers. They are featured in the animated series Xiaolin Showdown. When the name of a Shen Gong Wu is said resolutely, its powers can be used by the holder. Shen Gong Wu in Chinese means "holy skill thing" or literally "tool of God". Shen Gong Wu is not to be confused with the Kamidogu from the Mortal Kombat series.<br>  <br>  The first Xiaolin Showdown was between Grand Master Dashi and Wuya. It was a major battle, of which Dashi used the Shen Gong Wu against Wuya's Heylin magic. Eventually, Grand Master Dashi was the victor, and Wuya was locked in a puzzle box. Determined to ensure that it did not happen again, Grand Master Dashi and the dragon Dojo hid the Shen Gong Wu all over the World.<br>  <br>  After 1,500 years, Wuya returned and began to collect the Shen Gong Wu in order to rule the world. She usually works with Jack Spicer, but they often bring in others to help them. They are the Heylin.<br>  <br>  In order to prevent Wuya's plans, Dojo worked with the 'Chosen Ones', and they also began collecting Shen Gong Wu. They are the Xiaolin Warriors.<br>  <br>  A Shen Gong Wu can only be located when it chooses to reveal itself, and at that point, both Wuya and Dojo sense it and can locate its general area. Jack Spicer has also devised a mechanical device that senses a new Shen Gong Wu, and Chase Young is also capable of anticipating when a new Shen Gong Wu will be revealed.<br>  <br>  It is unknown how many there are, as the nature of the show is for at least one new one to be revealed in each episode, though in the first episode Wuya commented that there are "hundreds."<br>  <br>  Every thousands of years, the planetary alignment of our solar system makes the Shen Gong Wu gather together to form Mala Mala Jong and with the Ring of Nine Dragons to create the Fearsome Four.<br>  <br>  When the rare Heylin comet flies over Earth, the Wu comes alive when put on. Raimundo was subject to the Golden Tiger Claws, Third Arm Sash, Helmet of Jong and many others and was turned into a giant freakish brute until the comet had passed and it was safe to take the Wu off.|`|AA12317815	On the show Shaolin Showdown, Sheng gong wu are magical weapons used by shaolin warriors to defeat evil!|`|3f8418df19b3b87f85be3f356b266668aa	They were first used by Master Dashi

AA11244961	According to what I have heard, a 24 movie is in development.  That does not mean tha a script has been written at all, but it is being considered for a feature film.<br>  <br>  Look for updates as time goes on.|`|AA12289965	i think the sentinel is as close to a 24 movie as were gonna have|`|AA11207277	That's what they have been talking about on all the entertainment tv show's|`|AA12391438	I watched something on TV, can't remember what it was, but Keifer was on there from London, England saying he was filming it already.

AA12301845	Absolutely widescreen. So much of the movie is set against stunning landscapes, it would be tragic to lose it.<br>  <br>  Widescreen! :)|`|4a3e9b73a92c264b33a690c3d1a4fb28aa	Actually, fullscreen cuts off the sides, you don't see more on the top and bottom.  I say buy it in widescreen, so you get the full picture.  Not only is it the directors vision, the film has some really spectacular vistas to which only widescreen could do justice.|`|AA10068237	why would you even bother?|`|AA12299983	I would suggest pick up the format that will be best viewed on your TV.<br>  If you have regular TV then buy Full Screen<br>  and if you have Large TVs with 16:9 screen ratios, then go with Wide Screen.|`|da1e991214f22f8a2be9d6650c2e63adaa	Absolutely full screen!!!   I hate wide screen, it's like you're missing some of the movie.|`|AA11601372	I hate widescreen, go for full screen with all movies!|`|538480e4f66feb225c7a14d159770a61aa	Widescreen for sure.<br>  <br>  Widescreen is how the movie is filmed, the way the director wants for you to see their work.<br>  <br>  Full screen loses some of the shots.
