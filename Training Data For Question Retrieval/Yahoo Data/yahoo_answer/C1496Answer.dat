Without any hesitation he answered, “I would continue playing.” He could continue playing because he lived every moment of his young life doing God’s will. There was nothing undone that he would need to complete. He didn’t know when God would call, but he was ready to go at a moment’s notice because he always sought to do God’s will.|`|rHqe7oMoaa	Because despite continual claims that your God is just, he really isn't. Infinite punishment for finite "sin" is unjust.<br>  <br>  Because you've been indoctrinated from birth to believe that God exists and he's just itching to punish you if you make a wrong move. <br>  <br>  Because you realise that believing in God is multiple choice - there isn't just one God. So if you've picked/indoctrinated into the wrong one then you've spent your whole life going the wrong way. <br>  <br>  Because Christianity and Islam's favourite indoctrination method is to threaten you with firey hell.

Death is the greatest certainty any of us will ever face, and it doesn't make sense to refuse to think about it.<br>  <br>  At the same time, have you ever asked yourself why you think about death so much? The reason, I suspect, is because down inside you're afraid to die because you know you aren't prepared for death. After death, you will live on forever—either with God in heaven or apart from Him in the absolute loneliness of what the Bible calls hell. The Bible says, "Man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment" (Hebrews 9:27).<br>  <br>  The most important thing I can tell you, however, is that you do not need to fear death! God loves you, and He has provided the way for all your sins to be forgiven and for you to go to heaven when you die. That way is Jesus Christ, who took upon Himself the judgment you and I deserve. The Bible says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16).<br>  <br>  By faith turn to Christ and trust Him alone for your salvation. When we know Christ, we don't need to fear death any longer, because we know we belong to Him and He will take us to Himself when we die. Open your heart to Christ today, and He will help you conquer your fear of death. <br>  <br>  believer_in_jesus37421@yahoo.com|`|5Smw52iTaa	Because you were taught to believe in the almighty sky daddy and you still haven't realised that it's just an old fairytale...|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	Because you're a theist, you fear god.<br>  <br>  as the bible says<br>  <br>  "Happy are those who FEAR the lord!"

I've been told countlessly that "my religion is wrong" and other nonsense.<br>  On no occasion, have I approached a member of any other religion and told them that theirs is wrong.<br>  People should have the right to believe in whichever diety they wish.<br>  I think a lot of other people struggle to accept other religions as they all truely believe that their religion is the right one, and therefore, any other religion is false.|`|iYW2ZVuFaa	I do not *have* to respect religion of any kind (I do not like laws that attempt to fashion my "morality") and I certainly do not want to have to accept them intellectually.  <br>  <br>  However, I would never wish to infringe upon another's right to believe whatever they like even if I find it to be repugnant.|`|0i80jUKeaa	How about, if the religion is true then you can practice it, and if it isn't true you can't.  That would be a great law as it would get rid of all the atheists and muslims and whatever and only Christians would be left.

If you do not like Hinduism, practice the belief system of your choice. But stop this nonsence. <br>  <br>  Casismis no longer cherished, praised and practiced in Hinduism. The cast no longer represent compartmentalised sections of society. There is no denying that they do exist but as ethnic group due to historical reasons. It is also a fact that during medieval period this system became rigid. But change is essance of Hinduism. Hindus are live to the problems of Hindu society and the defects would be ammended in due course. <br>  <br>  But what about Islam or any other Abrahmic religions? They are frozen in time and refuse to change since thousands of years. They would perish over a period of time. And such time is not in distant future. Where as Hinduism would flourish with necessary corrections for ever.

Wonder which scripture they follow.....:-(|`|Bb6fQtl0aa	Below is an excerpt from the book "The Wahhabi Myth" by Haneef James Oliver. The term "Wahhabi" is a slanderous term, used to attack Muslims who believe in following the Noble Qur'an and the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, with the same interpretation as the Companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and the scholars throughout Islamic history who also followed this way. For more information, see the book's website at <a href="http://www.theWahhabiMyth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.theWahhabiMyth.com</a> , inshaa-Allaah the read will be quite beneficial and insightful. And anyone who has studied the biography of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhaab, will not find any evidence of "extremism."<br>  <br>  ----<br>  ABRIDGED EXCERPT from "The Wahabi Myth"<br>  <br>  What is a Salafi and What is Salafism?<br>  <br>  The reader will notice that the word "Wahhabi" is always indented with quotation marks here at <a href="http://www.theWahhabiMyth.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.theWahhabiMyth.com.</a> Those who are labeled with this word do not themselves use this term, as it is used as a means of belittlement. The reasons for the rejection of this term are clearly outlined throughout this book. The correct way of referring to them is by terming them "Salafis", as they are those who adhere to the way of the "Salaf" - the Prophet Muhammad (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) and his companions.<br>  <br>  Following the way of the Salaf is the way which has been legislated in the Quran and Sunnah, the very sources of Islam. The Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) said to his daughter Fatimah: "Indeed, I am for you a blessed Salaf." (1)<br>  <br>  When asked about which was the correct and acceptable way of understanding Islam, the Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) replied by saying: "That which I and my companions are upon." (2)<br>  <br>  Similarly, Allah says in the Quran that He is pleased with the companions "and also those who follow them exactly (in faith)." (3)<br>  <br>  As such, He said regarding the Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him security) and his companions:<br>  <br>  "So if they believe as you (i.e. the Salaf) believe, they are indeed rightly guided." (4)<br>  <br>  All of the orthodox scholars of Islam followed the way of the Salaf in understanding religion. Early scholars such as Imam al-Awzaa'ee, who died 157 years after the Prophet's emigration to Medina, said: "Be patient upon the Sunnah, and stop where the people (i.e. where the Salaf) stopped, and say what they said, and refrain from what they refrained from, and follow the path of your righteous Salaf; for verily, sufficient for you is what was sufficient for them." (5)<br>  <br>  Today, one of the famous Sunni schools of jurisprudence is named after a scholar named Abu Haneefah. Millions of Muslims all over the world ascribe themselves to his school of jurisprudence; those who the media would term "mainstream" Muslims. Regarding adherence to the Salafi methodology, he said, "Adhere to the narrations and way of the Salaf, and beware of newly invented matters (in religion), for all of it is innovation." (6)<br>  <br>  The media claim that Salafis/"Wahhabis" believe that all those who do not follow their form of Islam are "heathens" (10) is a tall tale. Salafis believe that those Muslims who do not follow the understanding of the Salaf are not adhering to these and other clear texts. As such, they do not fall under the above-mentioned Quranic verse as being "rightly guided." Salafis distinguish between those who fall into religious innovation and those who fall into disbelief.<br>  <br>  When considering the proofs which are contained within the Quran and Sunnah and the statements of all the orthodox scholars of Islam from the earliest generations to the present time, it becomes obvious that it is a great blunder for the media to refer to Salafism as being a new movement called "Wahhabism" which came about only two centuries ago during the time of Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhab in Saudi Arabia.<br>  <br>  "So after the truth, what else can there be, save error?" [Quran 10:32]<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL NOTE: Regarding the other mentioned groups<br>  <br>  Shi'ah :  This group does not follow true Islam as they have exaggerated the status of the family of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, to the point where they build shrines dedicated to their worship. They have also introduced many practices that Allaah never sanctioned and rituals that were never taught by the Prophet, peace be upon him.<br>  <br>  Wahhaabi:  This is not a group, as mentioned before, the term "Wahhaabi" is a term used to insult Muslims who follow the Qur'aan, the Sunnah, and the understanding of Islam of the righteous generations.<br>  <br>  Bah'ai:  This group is not even considered Muslim. It is a cult that sought to combine the beliefs of multiple religions into one new religion that Allaah had never sent any authority for.|`|o1Lq2eikaa	let me ask sunni one thing<br>  <br>  when u so proudly say u follow quran and prophet mohamed hadith then why u all turned ur back on Mohamed last wishes ?<br>  <br>  thousand of reason u have to prove ur self correct but then let the world notice ur atrocity on us after Mohamed death and now to non muslim. <br>  <br>  shia are the true muslim and one day will take our Kaaba back<br>  <br>  husayn tell me which shrine shia worships or is this ur way to prove ur self correct without knowing things.|`|Rb84jDiEaa	those who obey Allah swt and His messenger, Mohammed (pbuh).

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

It is a unique name and in all probablity the Proper Name of  God Almighty. When translated in English it means " The Only One worth worshipping". So you have to say Allah always. <br>  <br>  Saying prayers in English is ok for initial period. But you should memorize prayers in Arabic. For your information, Arabic is the official language of Kingdom of Allah and saying prayers in Arabic results in quicker acceptance and immediate reward. <br>  <br>  I think remarriage is not necessary.

Allah is one and singular, there is no plural of Allah. If you add ‘dess’ to the word God, it becomes ‘Goddess’ that is a female God. There is nothing like male Allah or female Allah. Allah has no gender. If you add the word ‘father’ to ‘God’ it becomes ‘God-father’. God-father means someone who is a guardian. There is no word like ‘Allah-Abba’ or ‘Allah-father’. If you add the word ‘mother’ to ‘God’, it becomes ‘God-mother’. There is nothing like ‘Allah-Ammi’, or ‘Allah-mother’ in Islam. Allah is a unique word. If you prefix tin before the word God, it becomes tin-God i.e., fake God. Allah is a unique word, which does not conjure up any mental picture nor can it be played around with. Therefore the Muslims prefer using the Arabic word ‘Allah’ for the Almighty. Sometimes, however, while speaking to the non-Muslims we may have to use the inappropriate word God, for Allah. Since the intended audience of this article is general in nature, consisting of both Muslims as well as non-Muslims, I have used the word God instead of Allah in several places in this article. <br>  <br>  -no u cant perform ur salah in any other language than language of Quran|`|KNV7oPr3aa	salaam, no sis you need to learn how to pray properly in arabic.

Another teacher reminded me that we weren't to encourage the children to eat their food, I told this particular child, who was new this day, "Oh yes, that's ok, you don't have to eat it."  This three year old child looked down at his plate, shook his head and said, "I just don't eat this S*IT."  I had to hide my face so the others would not see me laughing.

4sh2oRR7aa	A lot of drug addicts and strung out and homeless thus probably don't have very much income or even may be rich. However a lot exchange needles anyway. HIV and Hep C are passed through body fluids, blood included. Addicts often share needles which exchanges blood. If someone has HIV/Hep C and you use their needle, chances are you will contract it. You only need to use it one time to have that happen. You don't have to use all the time. The needle exchange is so drug addicts don't pass on and/or contract Hep C/HIV from using others' needles. It's like disease control. Chances are that they are going to use anyway so the needle exchange is to prevent long term damage and disease. Basically you just go in, give them used needles and take new ones. It's just like it sounds. You exchange needles.|`|S6MqrWdjaa	i guess they are more worried about getting high than their personal health. when you are an addict only important thing in  life is getting high...its not about affording a new one they just dont care.

36R3v5VBaa	No, it's horrifying on any scale|`|5IkvPgfuaa	I agree with H S on almost all his points except how anti-semitic the UK is. There is not even a large minority of people with this view. Those who do are just plain old racists and a couple of brain cells above slime.|`|Hh9sRoZMaa	That is a good question you brought up. Have you tried Wikipedia?|`|kOlZqhSdaa	They are just trying to sell books, get some press and they hate the jews|`|zZxX5PXBaa	I think there are two background issues:<br>  <br>  First, Bishop Williamson is British, and there are still many people in Britain who are anti-semitic (both in the sense of disliking Jews, and in the sense of disliking all semitic people, including Arabs, loosely equated with 'Moslems'). Britain has had anti-Jewish violence for centuries, and there is still an element of it in modern society, even in sport, where Spurs, for instance, are still seen as a Jewish club, and attract abuse for that reason. Mind, they'd get abuse for any other reason the supporters of other clubs could think of, since abusing other clubs is a basic part of enjoying football.<br>  <br>  Anyway, it means that Williamson knows he has a constituency here, and also knows that his words have the potential here to actually encourage violence.<br>  <br>  Secondly, he's Catholic, and while I wouldn't press this against Catholics generally, it's a simple fact that most of the killings happened in the heart of Catholic Europe, particularly in Poland, where Auschwitz-Birkenau and several other major camps were located. If you look at Claude Lanzmann's film 'Shoah' there is an eloquent testimony to Catholicism's part in the Holocaust, as he interviews polish families living in houses that used to belong to Jewish families destroyed in the Holocaust, and as he interview modern Catholics who, clearly unconsciously, demonstrate that the attitudes of their parents and grandparents survive. It's sad watching for any Christian, but it tells an uncomfortable truth.<br>  <br>  Having seen one interview with him, he made no suggestion of new evidence, there was just a rather vain remark to the effect that as he looked at 'the evidence' he didn't see anything to suggest that large numbers had died. This is an absurd statement from a silly old man, I would suggest.<br>  <br>  Yes, these remarks are clearly anti-semitic, and as Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor clearly noted, they would render Williamson subject to criminal prosecution if they were repeated in Germany. I believe that would also be the case in France. If he had the courage of his convictions he would go to Germany and say these things, and face trial in the way that David Irving did before him. It's not terribly brave to say these things from Scandinavia, or Argentina, or even the UK, when he knows that he won't face criminal charges there.<br>  <br>  The encouraging thing for me has been the response in Germany, which as far as I can tell, including reading German press reports, has been overwhelming against Williamson. I think Merkel did well to speak out, but I understand that across Germany there is a wave of revulsion against Williamson, and a wave of anger against Ratzinger for failing to deal decisively with the issue .. a feeling that he has let Germany down badly, after his election to the papacy was such a milestone in Germany's sense of having rehabilitated itself after 1945. I understand that the outcry against these two foolish bishops has been most marked from German Catholics.<br>  <br>  I would have to say, having spent some time in Germany, that there is a huge difference between German culture today, and on the other hand UK and US culture. There is a much deeper sense of the wrongness of violence and the wrongness of racism. There is a stronger sense by far that the Holocaust was an evil, and there is a clear awareness still that it has lessons to teach us today, for instance about how we treat Moslems or Arabs.<br>  <br>  Williamson is a dinosaur, a wicked man with, as far as I can see, no conscience whatsoever, with no sense that his words can cause real damage (or worse, he realises it and wants that). Irresponsible. <br>  <br>  But to answer your final question, people think like this for  many reasons. Some people think it is a way to sell books (I have no idea if there is a book to come from Williamson, but it seems almost inevitable). Some people simply enjoy hating. Some people enjoy violence but prefer to incite it rather than getting their own hands dirty. Ultimately they believe things like this because they choose to, and they're not really interested in evaluating the evidence or evaluating the arguments of those who disagree with them. You see the same basic human trait on here hundreds of times a day, with dogmatic atheists goading Christians, and dogmatic Christians goading back. Willilamson is really just another nasty, infantile little troll.|`|addec7857a715f2e28715837812ec5fbaa	Any bloke who measures slaughter in APPROXIMATE hundreds of thousands ... in mitigation of guilt, is in need of a reality check<br>  Williamson is a dangerous poo'ole

In order to become everything, God must experience being God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Just like the color white which must be divided into three colors (blue, red, and yellow) through a spectrum in order to give color to our world.   <br>  <br>  God the Father represents a genderless being (gay or lesbian or whatever). S/He also represents the Spirits. In Hinduism, God the Father is Shiva. That's color Blue. It represents Water which is Liquid matter.<br>  <br>  God the Son represents the male gender. He is the representation of Humankind. In Hinduism, God the Son is Vishnu. That's color Yellow. It represents ripe fruits or Earth which is Solid matter.<br>  <br>  God the Holy Spirit represents the female gender. She is Mother Nature (remember, she was represented by a dove). In Hinduism, God the Holy Spirit is Brahma. That's color Red. It represents Fire which is Gas.<br>  <br>  So you see, if God doesn't divide Him/Herself into three aspects, then there would be no humankind, no mother nature, no spirits, no colors, no solid, no liquid, no gas, no everything...
3H8jvC2aaa	It all matters.  It is all retained.  We are the conduit through which experience is channeled to the whole.  We are all connected and what I do and experience affects us all.  What I learn goes forward to future generations.  What they learn from us expands their knowledge.  This expansion is what has put humans at the head of the food chain.<br>  <br>  This expansion isn't left to chance.  We come here with a purpose, but we also have the free will to deviate from our path.  There is guidance but we still have the choice to ignore it.  This has made for good and bad decisions.  But they both work to teach lessons.  Without these triumphs and missteps, we as humans would not have advanced as rapidly as we have.  But deviating from our path and ignoring guidance brings much pain.  The further we deviate the harder our lives are.<br>  <br>  Everything comes down to balance.  We move through each lifetime and pick up knowledge.  We also collect good and bad karma.  Bad things happen to good people because they have to pay their karmic debt, no matter how good they are in this life.  Once karma is paid, the road opens up with new opportunity.  But you will always be tested to make sure you learned from the payment of the karma.  A lot of people are stuck in a constant cycle of being a victim then being a perpetrator.  Forgiveness is key.  Learning to forgive those that hurt you and moving on helps you travel your path with more clarity.<br>  <br>  You are right, sometimes sitting quietly and taking in the energy that is trying to guide you in the right direction is better than just doing to be doing.

This is not a wrong or right path choice but rather just a different direction. <br>  To explain it in a nut shell I would call it the path of atheism or non-theism. To go into more detail I would have to walk the path of non-theism for a while. <br>  I am looking into Zen Buddhism as a path. <br>  I don't believe there are any supposed to be paths only paths that we choose. <br>  Like should I take the freeway that is faster but boring or the state roads that take more time but have more scenery?

onkUcy19aa	Tacos are as American as apple pie despite being considered Mexican food, and "spiritually speaking" tacos are as good.<br>  <br>  About Tacos<br>  By Ann Johnson, eHow Editor <br>  <br>  Tacos are as American as apple pie despite being considered Mexican food. Fast-food franchises, such as Taco Bell and Dell Taco, have made a fortune peddling a quick and inexpensive version of the taco. After the 1960s fish tacos became popular; since that time America has embraced a wide variety of taco recipes. They are served in Mexican restaurants, fast-food franchises, in homes and offered as incentives by restaurants to lure in customers to happy hour.<br>  <br>  In Mexico, taco is a word similar to sandwich. With a sandwich there is typically two pieces of bread and some sort of filling, which might be meat and or vegetables. Instead of bread, the taco uses a corn or flour tortilla. The tortilla might be served soft or warmed, or it can be fried in oil and folded to create an envelope for the filling. Sometimes the taco is filled and then fried. <br>  <br>  Features<br>  Taco meats include shredded beef, ground beef, pork, chicken and fish. Popular toppings include avocados, guacamole, sour cream, cilantro, hot peppers, shredded lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, onions, salsa and taco sauce. Corn tortillas can be purchased soft or hard. Store-bought hard corn shells are pre-shaped in a U and are dry and brittle. Frying your own corn tortilla, to make a hard shell, produces a crispy, slightly greasy and pliable shell with a fresher, more desirable flavor. <br>  <br>  History<br>  Wrap sandwiches have become trendy lunch items in American eateries. Sandwich ingredients are spread over a flavored tortilla and rolled up to make the wrap. In Mexico the tortilla has been used as a wrap for centuries. It has long been a staple in Mexico and was a primary feature of the Aztec diet. It wasn't until around 1914 that recipes for tacos appeared in an English language cookbook in California. <br>  <br>  Types<br>  The stereotypical taco in the United States is seen as a corn tortilla that has been fried crisp in oil and bent into a U shape to hold a filling of ground beef, shredded iceberg lettuce, grated cheddar cheese, diced tomatoes, diced onions and taco sauce. In Mexico the taco is often nothing more than a warm tortilla that has been wrapped around shredded meat or refried beans and seasoned with sauce. <br>  <br>  Considerations<br>  In the 1970s a salad version of the taco evolved. The taco salad began as a green salad, tossed with ground beef, diced tomatoes, shredded cheese and tortilla chips. Over time the taco salad recipe transformed into many versions, including a salad served in a giant fried bowl-shaped flour tortilla. Some restaurants offer salad bars where customers can fill their tortillas from a wide selection of ingredients.|`|AA11521494	How does this relate to the religion and spirituality section?|`|OyBuEpOTaa	Nothing, they give me heartburn and make me burp.|`|EXurNsB4aa	aughhh I'm really hungry D:|`|OvJPvXMEaa	they are tasty nd fun 2 eat! also u can hav taco competitions!!!!!!!|`|AxOnqLEOaa	Keep in mind men love women tacos !|`|ITiuIb1Waa	your so cool.you dont give a f**k about anything cos your a wild guy.what a wacky question|`|wXLH6sm4aa	that they are so frikin delicious!!!!|`|p0mCoRyMaa	they taste good chuck.|`|K85qdy38aa	There yummy!<br>  and now I'm hungry...thanks!|`|cuIX13BKaa	They grow on trees, that the Taco Bell people pick each morning piping hot!

UARQA0CLaa	Let us look at what the Bible teaches.  Your first question is about John 3:5 "Jesus answered, Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."<br>  <br>  Often times a person will pick one verse and try to interpret what it says.  Unfortunately, they take it out of context.  One must read the whole account of Nicodemus starting with the first verse John 3:1-21<br>  Nicodemus poses a question to Jesus Verse 4 "...How can a man be born when he is old?  can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?"  Nicodemus was not understanding what Jesus was saying in verse 3 and so he asks the above mentioned question and Jesus responds in vers 5.  When John the Baptizer was baptizing people he was baptizing with water.  Jesus had not established his church at this time.  On the day of pentecost (Acts 2) Peter gives his first sermon after the church was established.  When the men of Jerusalem and devout men of all nations were pricked in their heart upon learning that the man they crucified was indeed God's son, they asked verse 37 "...Men and brethren what shall we do?"  In verse 38 Peter tells them "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."  When one obeys the gospel upon learning of Jesus death, burial and resurrection, when they have Godly sorrow for their sins and realize that Jesus bore those sins for them on the cross, it brings about the desire to repent (turn away) from their sins, they believe and so they will confess Jesus' name to others and then they will be baptized (immersion) for the remission of sin.<br>  <br>  Second question was about another way to recieve salvation.  The Bible teaches one:<br>  God's Gospel Plan of Salvation:  The death, burial and resurrection of Jesus, the Son of God (I Corinthians 15:1-4)<br>  <br>  HEAR this gospel message (Romans 10:3-17)<br>  BELIEVE this message with all one's heart (John 8:24; John 3:16; Mark 16:15, 16)<br>  REPENT of sins (Luke 13:3,5; Acts 2:38)<br>  CONFESS one's faith in Christ (Romans 10:9,10; Acts 8:37)<br>  Be BAPTIZED for the remission of sins (Mark 16:15, 16; Acts 2:38; Acts 22:16; 1 Peter 3:21)<br>  *This will make one a Christian and place one into Christ where salvation is and all spiritual blessing are found (Ephesians 1:3),  This is synonymous with being added to the one church (Ephesians 4:4).  which is Christ's body Acts 2:47; Ephesians 1: 22, 23).<br>  LIVE FAITHFUL to Christ the rest of you life (Revelation 2:10b.)<br>  <br>  Speaking in tongues does not give you salvation.  The purpose of the apostles speaking in tongues (different languages) was because they were commission to carry the gospel to all nations.  They needed to be able to speak in these different languages.  Look at Acts 2:7, 8.  The Apostles were the only men to be able to pass on their gifts to others, but they didn't pass on all their gifts.  When the Apostles died so did their gifts.  The men who received from the apostles did not have the ability to pass them on.  So tongues ceased.  Now that is not to say that a person can't learn to speak different languages, it just is done like it was in the time of Jesus.<br>  <br>  I think your friend is feeding you a bunch hog wash.  They very well may be ignorant.  The Bible teaches that one should "try the spirits to see if they are of God."  Don't take what one person tells you as truth.  Make them show you in the Bible.  Chances are they won't know.<br>  <br>  I am not sure which verse in Matthew 11 you are referencing.

The verbal exchange was handled well, because those happen, and you pretty much got away with it. But you later demonstrated that you cannot control your anger, and you demonstrated that in front of customers. And their children. No company wants to scare away customers by employing angry people. And it is irrelevant whether the person who fired you was a man or woman.<br>  A man would not have gotten a write-up; he would have been fired too. Further, I need to agree with the person above asking you to supply statistics showing that men are less likely to be fired for workplace violence than women. Because every incident of workplace violence I have heard of, the violent employee was fired regardless of gender. Men and women have been fired even for threatening violence. So please tell us where you got this information.|`|boWDjT9Gaa	Actually, even if you were a man, you too would have been dismissed for conduct unbecoming, unprofessionalism and possibly insubordination.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

4hsl2toNaa	Lent, that is right up there with trinity, hellfire, immortal soul.  Man made idea put into motion by man thinking self sacrifice is pleasing to God.  Probably a notion that Jesus fasted in the desert 40 days and nights, their congregations could give something up for a length of time.  <br>  Jehovah does not want self sacrifice, at an appointed time.  He wants love, proper worship, obedience, and honor.  These are things that are due him as he the true God and our creator.  Anything that is not ordained by him or from man is not pleasing to him.  <br>  <br>  Now to answer your first question.   I am giving up false teachings and pursuing the truth of God's word.   <br>  OH!!   Silly me, I already did that 27+ years ago.  Oh!  These senior moments!!   No wonder I don't do lent.|`|VYLEfiSTaa	What About Lent?<br>  <br>  What, then, is the basis for Christendom’s practice of fasting during Lent? Both Catholic and Protestant churches recognize Lent, although the manner of observing it differs from church to church. Some eat just one meal a day during the full 40-day period preceding Easter. Others fast totally only on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. For some, Lent requires abstaining from meat, fish, eggs, and milk products.<br>  <br>  Lent is supposedly based on Jesus’ 40-day fast after his baptism. Was he then establishing a ritual to be followed yearly? Not at all. This is evident from the fact that the Bible does not record any such practice among the early Christians. Lent was first observed in the fourth century after Christ. Like many other teachings of Christendom, it was borrowed from pagan sources.<br>  <br>  If Lent is in imitation of Jesus’ fasting in the wilderness after his baptism, why is it observed during the weeks leading up to Easter—supposedly the time of his resurrection? Jesus did not fast during the days prior to his death. The Gospel accounts indicate that he and his disciples visited homes and ate meals in Bethany just a few days before he died. And he ate the Passover meal the night before his death.—Matthew 26:6, 7; Luke 22:15; John 12:2.<br>  <br>  There is something to be learned from Jesus’ fasting after his baptism. He was embarking on a vital ministry. The vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty and the future of the entire human race were involved. This was a time for deep meditation and for prayerfully turning to Jehovah for help and guidance. During this time Jesus appropriately fasted. This indicates that fasting can be beneficial when done with the right motive and on a fitting occasion.—Compare Colossians 2:20-23.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Look in your bible for every instance of fasting and ashes and repentance.

I think the reason is to give thanks for what Jesus has given up. Why it is 40 days I do not know. Nothing is recorded in the Bible to have happened or started 40 days prior to Jesus dying on the cross.<br>  <br>  After having been a Christian all my life, I only heard of "Lent" very recently. Perhaps this tradition is more prevalent among Catholic Christians. I do not think it is wrong, though, to practice it. <br>  <br>  We protestants normally avoid things that could be construed as earning one's salvation by sacrificing something, because Christ is the ultimate and complete sacrifice. That is my personal reason for not engaging in it.|`|tKr7sXEJaa	my parents are giving up meat<br>  my boyfriend is giving up video games and chocolate<br>  and since i am a vegetarian, do not drink pop, or eat chocolate(rarely) i am giving up my favorite unhealthy food...chips and chip dip<br>  and i am fasting on wednesday)today ash wednesday) and also it is not in the bible|`|4q66CvgLaa	ive heard of the word lent but never knew what it meant till now . from what i learned it is up there with false beliefs that by giving up something like food for a day u may earn extra points to salvation which is false . which is what a lot of people in Christendom do so the answer to ur question what would i give up at lent , nothing ,  because i try to please jehovah at all times|`|QAj0qnwJaa	Meat and Coke ( soft drinks).<br>   when Jesus walks in the desert for 50 days :) good luck in ur search.|`|SOfbIOzUaa	The bank lent us some money and we're paying it back with interest.

However, if one permits GOOD translations, then the followers of Jesus and Mohammed are able to read the words of the prophets for themselves and are no longer dependent on the interpretations of priests and imams. <br>  The Christian church vehemently oppose the translation of the Bible into the national languages, because they feared they would no longer be able to convince the people of their own interpretations.<br>  A Muslim Indian once asked me if I had an English translation of the Qu'ran.

OyBuEpOTaa	It was a mistake, and no one wants you to hurt yourself. That is not what Lent is all about. religious practice is not based only on reward and punishment.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	You can't "break" Lent.<br>  <br>  You just start over. And don't try to do stuff that's not healthy.<br>  <br>  Also worth remembering ... no fasting or giving up stuff on Sundays. Sundays are not counted in the 40 days of Lent, and Sunday is always a feast day, in honor of the risen Christ..|`|Gc49JgoQaa	OMG, GLUE IT BACK TOGETHER NOW!!!|`|yB0nVXfWaa	My dear - honestly - you are in a bind about this, aren't you?  What's this thing with 'what shall I do for Lent?' getting everywhere?<br>  <br>  Listen, being a Christian is not to do with observing holy days - see Gal.4:10.  This is legalism, and it's producing the fruit of condemnation in you, just as it always does!<br>  <br>  I have noticed this thing about 'Shrove Tuesday' and 'Ash Wednesday' coming in, along with 'Lent' where it never did before.  This is the old Church calendar of holy days and it should - quite honestly - best be forgotten.  Next, you'll be observing 'saints days'!<br>  <br>  I advise you to just keep to Easter (= Passover) and Christmas and leave it at that, for all the rest is religiosity and things men have thought up (they can always give you a 'good reason') that're honestly distractions - or extremist practices - that have absolutely no place in the simple, biblical faith passed down to us from the first apostles of the Lord.<br>  <br>  Please, don't start again - you are absolutely under no compulsion from God to do this.  It is not part of his requirement of you and, what's more, it doesn't make you any more holy, it just makes you more religious.  Don't you see that?<br>  <br>  Did you promise God that you would give up chocolate for Lent?  Well, learn a lesson now, never make promises to God that you cannot keep - always say (because of human weakness) 'I will try' and leave it at that, for God is not impressed with those who go back on their word.  But you seem quite young, and God will understand that you said it at this time in your immaturity if you go before him.<br>  <br>  What else can I say?  Just that, if you want to grow in the Lord, this is not the way to do it, by observing these extra-biblical practices such as Lent.  They are Catholic, don't you know, and Protestants are supposed to have got free of all that.  Do you really want to take on again all that old Catholic 'bag and baggage' which has no power either to save or make us holy, but only to bring in more bondage and condemnation?<br>  <br>  There is a scripture which says 'the sow, after having a wash, returns to wallowing in the mire' (II Pet.2:22), so  beware, that, having got free from these things of man's religion, you do not return to them and lose the things of true faith you once had.|`|dXyR1R8Yaa	I am not exactly religious (agnostic) but I know that most religions promote the sacredness of life. I think that God would prefer you to look after your health than follow the tradition of lent. God would not give you life for you to hurt yourself for him/her. Furthermore it is the thought that counts and you tried. If you really want to continue I suggest you give up something else, perhaps non-food related. And don't most people believe God forgives all - especially if you are repentant which you seem to be.|`|5AbCtkWFaa	Having grown up Jewish, I can only saw that halacha (our laws) can be broken to save a life.  If you are hypoglycemic, you should not be playing with your diet.  You need to eat regularly, and if your god is truly merciful, he will understand that.  If you give up chocolate, get some other snack bars without chocolate and eat those.|`|NXTpQSdhaa	Does it matter? Christian salvation is through acceptance of Jesus, not giving up chocolate.<br>  <br>  Or maybe you are not a Christian? Which would then make you a communist and they don't observe lent either.|`|d2lvgxJhaa	You should honestly give up lent.<br>  <br>  Let me get this straight.  You are worried about burning in hell for an eternity for eating chocolate chips!<br>  <br>  I'm so glad I'm an atheist.|`|PcNzgisHaa	whAT?? its only like, the first day omg|`|36R3v5VBaa	God does not expect you to be perfect.|`|0yTM98Odaa	If you are hypoglycemic you should eat regularly, eating regularly is good for you anyway!  Give up something else.|`|7c73d357ee89c177275de5c2d1c35fd2aa	What on earth possessed you to do something so obviously self-destructive as give up a life-saving diet?

If you are keeping something from them, they would definitely be able to feel it. <br>  Just a thought though, don't you think it would be better to come right out and tell them rather than keep on hiding in the dark? I think this because whatever you do, they will still eventually find out. There is nothing to lose by telling them straight out that you are smoking. Hiding it would only make things worse. it would even make you lose your parents' trust in you.|`|snLAfLAAaa	Yep. My partner is 32 and STILL hides the fact he's a smoker from his parents. To me it is obvious that they know, but nobody says anything. He is very diligent with hygiene and never smells of smoke, but they're not stupid. If your parents are non-smokers, they will be very sensitive to any sign of smoke. If they are smokers or were once smokers, they'll be able to read the signs. So either way, they know...|`|IclpoUl0aa	I would say so. <br>  <br>  Im a smoker, and when i was younger i tried to hide it from my rents, but they always smell it off you. or notice you seem to be going out for an unusual amount of walks.lol.|`|UdIybwRpaa	Yes. As much as you might try to hide it you will smell like an ashtray and unless they smoke they will smell it on you.|`|NhqkAvOyaa	Your parents knows it always, they smell it on  your breath and the color of your lips.<br>  Mostly on your clothes.

Jesus was teaching his last long lesson on different subjects. He was getting so unstable that he lost track of the questions that his disciples were asking him…<br>  <br>  John 13:36 (NIV) Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where are you going?"<br>  <br>  John 14:5 (NIV) Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?" <br>  <br>  Jesus didn’t answer them, but towards the end of this last training class Jesus is complaining that nobody is asking him where he is going!!!<br>  <br>  John 16:5 (NIV) Now I am going to him who sent me, yet none of you asks me, “Where are you going?”* (*At this point Saint Peter and Saint Thomas started to bang their heads against the wall).<br>  <br>  Obviously Jesus was so depressed about dying that he just couldn’t remember anything anymore. Then he goes to the Garden of Gethsemane sweating tear drops of blood in desperate fear of dying for anybody! He was in need of a comforter, but God the Holy Ghost, aka “Another Comforter” was nowhere to be found! Instead an angel creature of God showed up (with a box of napkins?)… The Preachers are covering up the fact that Jesus was yellow-bellying at the idea of going to the Holy Cross!<br>   <br>  Luke 22:44 And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.<br>  <br>  Jesus started to shed blood even before he went to the Holy Cross!<br>  <br>  Hebrews 5:7-8 (NIV) During the days of Jesus' life on earth, HE OFFERED UP PRAYERS AND PETITIONS WITH LOUD CRIES AND TEARS TO THE ONE WHO COULD SAVE HIM FROM DEATH* (*This Son of a God is not an atheist in a foxhole! I never heard an atheist doing this number in a foxhole!), and he was heard because of his reverent submission. ALTHOUGH HE WAS A SON, HE LEARNED OBEDIENCE* (Yeah… naughty Jesus! God the Father up in the sky taught him a lesson just for the heck of it “because it pleased God!”) FROM WHAT HE SUFFERED* (*the Bible writers were not too careful writing about Jesus credentials, but the Christians today are willing to kill to defend what the preachers tell them! I know that Islam is much worse, but that is not an excuse to pick the Christian religion or “Jesus” or any religion at all! A lot of high profile people are declared Christians and they won’t be the first ones to change even if they figure out that Christianity is the biggest scam in the world today!)<br>  <br>  I can almost still hear Jesus crying out loud! That is probably why Jesus didn’t spend the promised full 3 days and 3 nights in Hell, but only 2 nights, one day and hardly any time of the first and last day. Jesus Christ was really horrified to die for anybody! The FUNNIEST JOKE ON JESUS that any Christian could possible dream up is the fancy artistic rendition of the Holy Cross that killed him!  It now identifies Christianity!  Showing a dead body hanging on any cross is too gross for a lot of Christians so the Protestants do not recognize the Crucifix, but only the empty Cross.  The absurd worship of so many crosses of Jesus proves the sadomasochistic orientation of the Christian religion… it is barbaric! Jesus flesh is beaten to a pulp thoroughly tenderized and heavily marinated in Roman soldiers’ spit in preparation for hanging totally naked on a Holy Cross as the “spotless Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world!” There is no historical record that the Roman soldiers ever dressed their victim’s genital area in a diaper before hanging them on any cross! The next time that a sweet Catholic lady or nun prays before a crucifix she ought to know that the diaper is NOT there! She can go ahead and ask the Pope if the Roman soldiers ever dressed their victims with a white clean diaper before they crucify them!   <br>  <br>  No wonder the Bible writers have Jesus sweating TEARS OF BLOOD begging his Father in Heaven “to pass the cup”. It would have been much easier if God the Father would have assigned a “Guardian Angel” to protect Eve from eating a fruit from the wrong tree! That would have saved the WHOLE world that God loves so much without killing any member of the Holy Trinity! You have to have a specially conditioned stomach and a pervert mind to be a Christian! No wonder they call it the “Slaughter House Religion”! In spite of all the virtual suffering of Jesus Christ Saint Paul comes along later on and finishes WHATEVER PAIN JESUS STILL HAD TO SUFFER IN HIS OWN FLESH for the sins of the “elect” and for their salvation so they can go to Fairy Heaven when they die!<br>  <br>  Colossians 1:24 (NIV) Now I* (*Saint Paul) rejoice in what was suffered for you, and I FILL UP IN MY FLESH WHAT IS STILL LACKING IN REGARD TO CHRIST'S AFFLICTIONS, for the sake of “his body, which is the church”.* (*crappy talk, but what the heck!)<br>  <br>  For his work the Bible writers have God rewarding Saint Paul with the "STIGMATA"* (*the marks of Jesus crucified). He was the first Christian to get it!<br>  <br>  Galatians 6:17 (NIV) FINALLY, let no one cause me trouble, for I BEAR ON MY BODY THE MARKS OF JESUS. (“I lie not!” –Saint Paul)<br>  <br>  You ought to know that atheists do know how to read the Bible the way it is… not the way it has to be read according to the dogmas of a particular Church brand. The Bible is full of Holy Religious Crap on/in every page! Christians need to have preachers telling them what Christianity ought to be all about because MOST CHRISTIANS don’t read the Bible and those who do follow a poached list of verses to be read on specific days of the week! There is no need to read anybody’s book to know what the Bible is all about. It suffices to read the Bible carefully and objectively! It is all in the Bible! I know that thousands if not millions of free loaders are making a living on any religion, especially the “Jesus” religion… They managed to convince a lot of people and even national leaders in this world that the Clergy and the Preachers speak for a higher authority!|`|d05b366085d8773ec7654e3ad2b991cdaa	The Good Samaritan is excellent if understood as a parable in which the spiritually needy person is robed and beaten, and all kinds of his associates pass by on the other side of the roadway, pretending that he was not there, until a Samaritan who was - as were all Samaritans - the cultural, religious, and national enemy of Palestinian Jews, but this man did not see what was wrong with the man, he only saw his needs.<br>  <br>  Work on this story, it has some excellent situations regarding worldly and religious alienation, yet the GS comes through ignoring the markers set by nationality, custom, and religion to help this man get shelter, medicine, food, etc, and promised to pay whatever more than the sum he gave the innkeeper it took to get the wounded man back on his feet again.<br>  <br>  Jesus is the GS, needy friends and neighbours are symbolised by the beaten man, and our role is to be donkeys for Jesus, and bear the wounded to the safety of the Houses of the Lord, where he will be safe [saved].<br>  <br>  QUILL<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I have just read an answer from a respondent whose contribution is an incontinent rant, obviously intended to insult Christians, particularly Christian ladies that are Catholic and have taken the veil.  Such conduct is shameful.<br>  <br>  The respondent also fails to understand the nature of the three most usual crucifixes and the cross.  <br>  <br>  The Roman Cross has the dying Jesus in agony to remind Catholic Christians of the suffering Jesus willingly underwent for us.  That is a valid representation, but only if one knows what one is seeing.<br>  <br>  The Eastern Orthodox Cross has a dying Jesus with his head raised, because he known that by his dying there he has triumphed over sin and death and paved the way for salvation, and therefor this crucifix shows Jesus Triumphant.<br>  <br>  Protestants largely favour an empty Cross, because it represents Jesus Christ's moment of soteriological death, and at the same time reminds them that Jesus was not left on the Cross, but that he was taken down and entombed, but was resurrected, and therein lies their hope.<br>  <br>  It should be recognised that all three forms of the cross make statements that are pertinent to the faith of all who are or can be called Christians.  Each is a statement of faith with which neither of the other two disagrees, but, au contraire, embrace unreservedly.  <br>  <br>  It is easy to cast aspersions and doubts onto things that we do not understand, and to do so with malice exposes ill will, paranoia, and, perhaps, misogyny.<br>  <br>  Besides which, who knows what else is lurking in the darkness of ignorance and evident hostility that seems not to comprehend that artistic sensitivity obscures much that our societies do not wish to be on public view.   <br>  <br>  It is not a theological nicety, but a civilised way of showing what happened according to the artist’s understanding, but, at the same time not being focussed like a schoolboy on the sexuality of the subject to where one announces what lies concealed under the chastely arranged gauze.  <br>  <br>  It might not be possible for us to be accurate at all times, but unless one is suffering from boorish oafishness it is possible to remain civil in our discussions, questions, and answers.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yes?|`|Gc49JgoQaa	Just ask Jesus.

What I'm trying to do here is to get you to relax, to not be so preoccupied with getting, so you can respond to God's giving. People who don't know God and the way he works fuss over these things, but you know both God and how he works. Steep your life in God-reality, God-initiative, God-provisions. Don't worry about missing out. You'll find all your everyday human concerns will be met. Give your entire attention to what God is doing right now, and don't get worked up about what may or may not happen tomorrow. God will help you deal with whatever hard things come up when the time comes."<br>   <br>  -Matthew 6:30-34 (The Message)<br>  <br>  Jesus is NOT implying, that we need not take action to do our best to provide for ourselves and our families. (1 Timothy 5:8). He is however, telling us that if we set our focus and priorities around spiritual matters, God in turn will provide for us the necessities to live a happy life.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps :)|`|CjJKUMl8aa	The Great Commission<br>  Footprints on the sand|`|94ab0da7299b6d087039f5b8d0109652aa	David in Lions Den, Jonah in Fish etc

RQtYkwXgaa	*huggles fat bob*  Of course I love the Cure.<br>  <br>  Well many goths would like the cure just because several of their albums are considered goth rock.

I listen to all kinds of stuff, and I've got no problem admitting that even though my friends are almost all metalheads and goths. I also don't feel the need to fit into any specific group- by stereotype standards, it'd be hard to place me but I would be somewhere between goth and metal, but at the same time I'm incredibly geeky and a bit anal about getting good grades (even though I've almost finished university). If people don't like it, they should just leave me the hell alone.<br>  <br>  I know someone who is very normal- blonde hair, fashionable clothes, does an office job- and she loves The Cure.<br>  <br>  I think that the labels are there so that we can feel like we belong somewhere- after all, we are social animals. I don't have a problem with labels as such because it does help a lot of people to find friends and people with similar interests. It only bothers me when someone says "Oh we're all emos, you don't look like us so you can't listen to this band" because it's completely stupid and childish. If you're secure in your identity you shouldn't care if people class you as something and you shouldn't care if people who aren't like you have some of the same likes and dislikes.|`|5j0NgLDmaa	I love the Cure!

That's suggested by the anguish you express over the unfair type-casting that you see people all around you doing, and by your apparent inability to just shrug off the silly judgmentalism of other people.  If you *are* young, you can take comfort from the fact that all of this will just melt away as you get older.  Most adults just take for granted other people's personal choices in looks and lifestyles.<br>  <br>  Typing everyone we meet is something we all do, it's a human survival instinct that doesn't always serve us well.  Get used to being typed, as well as to typing other people.  It's just life.<br>  <br>  That doesn't mean people should *assume* their typing of others is correct, and then act on it as if their assumptions are proven facts.  That's how wars start, among other nastiness.  Acting on your own assumptions, without ever questioning them (never mind actually verifying them for truth) is something that will happen less and less among the people around you as you grow older.  And when it does still happen, you'll be able to brush it off without a second thought.<br>  <br>  Just be strong and content with who you are, and you'll be able to relax.

Not only that, he would also be in all of us, which he is not, either, only in those he indwells.  This idea of omnipresence is too close to pantheism and panentheism, for me.<br>  <br>  Now, don't tell me you're so naif as to suggest that God didn't know where Adam and Eve was in the Garden and he didn't know they had eaten the forbidden fruit?  Don't you see, he knew perfectly well (because he made them) where they were and what they'd done, but this is how loving parents address their children, isn't it? - asking them questions they already know the answer to, in order to make them own up to things.  <br>  <br>  In the case of Adam and Eve, it was done so that they should condemn themselves out of their own mouths (best way to learn a lesson, and also for us too, who read the account).  God asked these questions so it would be made abundantly clear what they had done wrong and so that they would see that the consequences were those they had brought on themselves. <br>  <br>  As regards asking Cain where Abel was, it's clearly the same thing.  God knew exactly where Abel was, but he was starting to deal with  Cain about this, and so he asks him, to see what he will say (which, by the way, he also knows already), and we see, right from the beginning, Cain's rebellious attitude, when he says 'Am I my brothers keeper?'.  A crafty answer, don't you think? - and also you can see him trying to justify himself and wriggle away.  <br>  <br>  That's why God asked the question - not because he didnt know - but because he wanted Cain to see himself reflected back, for we the readers to see what was in Cain, and to initiate his righteous judgment which shortly followed.|`|3aVxJYf6aa	omniscient ...YES <br>  <br>   omnipresent...NO...according to Jesus, God is in heaven remember the model prayer...our heavenly father Who is in heaven.|`|2a56649ebd35fba176f5811eb05dd7b2aa	In both situations, God was giving them the opportunity to admit their wrongdoing, in both situations they thought that they could hide their crime from God, and failed miserably.<br>  <br>  The closest parallel is a child trying to hide from Mum behind the sofa after breaking something, Mum has heard the crash and knows something has been broken and there's only one possible culprit.<br>  <br>  I sometimes wonder if their punishment would have been as severe if they hadn't tried to evade the consequences of their actions.|`|bmqJs2hwaa	he is inept....<br>  <br>  <br>  seriously i knew where they were at.... i was just bullshXtting... you know like marco....

Jesus is stressing to be prepared and the way to be prepared he tells you in these passages - to keep godly, to watch for the signs of the times, to purify oneself, etc.  It's also all in the New Testament - how to be a Christian, starting with repentance and the new birth.  For, in the first instance, Jesus is coming back for his own (John 14:1-3).<br>  <br>  There are increasing signs that his return is very near, and Jesus said that we will be able to read these signs and thereby know that it (he) is near.<br>  <br>  The greatest sign is the sign of the fig tree, because thats not easy to mistake.  Now, the fig tree signifies Israel (read it in the Olivet accounts) and when she 'blossoms and blooms' (ie. puts forth spring flowers) you will know that 'summer is nigh'.  In just the same way, the people of the Jews, coming back to their land according to prophecy, and there establishing a state, which has not been since Nebuchadnezzar's time (3,500 years ago), are a prophetic 'sign of the times'.  Now, you see Israel 'blossom and bud', for her economy is increasing among others that are failing, just as the Lord is blessing her, not because of any virtue of her own, but in faithfulness to his promise.<br>  <br>  There is one prophetic sign, in place since May 1948, whereby we can know that his coming for his Churdh cannot be very far away, and the rest of the scriptures - yes, in their entirety - tell you how to be ready, for that is the whole Word of God to us.|`|AyPF2TFlaa	Jesus said always be ready, Today could be your last who knows are you ready?<br>  Like a man said live everyday as it's your last and you know your going to stand before God.|`|Gc49JgoQaa	Buy an apocalypse safety kit.|`|AA10140520	That's my biggest curiosity, is when it happens & life after death if it's true.|`|QFf9phAmaa	the atmospher will look changed and everyone will looking happy.|`|EGEOOZLXaa	We must be saved.

a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	On a forum like this if someone uses text language, it makes them appear young and/or uneducated.  I don't take them seriously since they obviously don't take themselves seriously.  Hearts, stars and other cutesy things also make me think the person is young and perhaps is looking for attention.<br>  <br>  The use of all capitals (after being told that it is yelling and is rude) makes me think that the person is arrogant.<br>  <br>  If someone fails to use spell check, I think it shows that they do not pay attention to detail.<br>  <br>  Poor grammar is so common that as long as it isn't extreme it doesn't influence my perception of the writer.<br>  <br>  Long cut-and-pastes give me the impression that the person is lazy.  A short excerpt with a link is sufficient along with a personal statement of what they think about the subject.<br>  <br>  If a question or answer is very well written, it makes me think that the writer is well educated, serious, and has given the subject more than superficial consideration.  I am much more interested in reading what they have to say.<br>  <br>  Those are just my first impressions.|`|eHzJjeqKaa	you can tell that people who write like this:<br>  <br>      "wats up wiv dis ppl?"   etc...<br>  or any crap spelling like that is either a kid or someone who thinks they are awesomely cool. and they are not<br>  <br>  I think people who use correct grammar are polite or smart enough to realise thats the way you should type.

D4jZM26Paa	Yes, of course, in Islam men and women are equal. Although, it doesn't seem this way when you look at some "Muslim" societies like Saudi Arabia or Yemen etc;|`|283tO9j9aa	Depends where they live. Here in the UK, most of the Muslim women work and a lot of Muslim parents expect their daughters to aim for university. Many of them drive (our next door neighbour does) and not all of them wear the headscarf. One of the girls I work with is Muslim and she doesn't cover her hair, she just dresses sensibly- she always wears trousers and a top that doesn't show cleavage or anything, so she still feels she is dressing modestly whilst being part of Britain. In a lot of places, Muslim women are allowed to drive, own property and keep their own surname when they get married if they want to. They're allowed to work as long as their kids come first, but any parent should put their kids before their job really.<br>  <br>  I think a lot of the modesty rules in Islam are intended to keep women safe and make sure they're respected rather than to oppress them. Unfortunately in a few countries they take it too far.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	Women according to the Koran have a lot of rights. (to bad rights have to be given to women of the world, and not a birth right as men have). I regress. To answer your question, it depends on what part of the world they live in.|`|03Xx7l8Baa	YES!<br>  <br>  Women in Islam are meant to be financially taken care of by their husbands and this is in the Quran....<br>  Read Surah Nisa'a (chapter 4)<br>  pay close attention to verses; 34-35<br>  Allah (swt) commands that men are to spend their wealth for women and therefore are overseers over women since they have been created with more strength in order to sustain for the both. Then talks about the honorable women and how to be one ;)<br>  <br>  NEVER, never, i repeat never is Islam different from one country than another. Islam is meant for ALL mankind till the end of time. If one country practices Islam differently than what is decreed, then they have strayed from Islam. Islam is the same in Oklahoma, Egypt, Saudia, Australia, Germany, England, etc.... People however practice what they can. That doesn't mean Islam changed. <br>  <br>  NOTE; this doesn't mean that a women goes and takes all her husband's money and spends it any in fashion she pleases. NO. She ALSO has obligations towards her husband and family and her husband's property. Again look at how to be an honorable woman.<br>  <br>  Bank accounts? Why not!? My father gave my mother a bank account plus a monthly *allowance? And actually we all had a bank account. But understandably perhaps some men cannot financially afford this and therefore it's okay if they don't. There should be no burden or stress greater than they can bear and it's unfair for women to demand this. On the other hand, there may be men who are financially able to give more, and so they can and do! <br>  <br>  Remember the things in life that are a fitnah, test/trial. Women, children and money/wealth.|`|2e859d32fe514ed3486570d4ec58b1e9aa	Yes.

HlFzl1piaa	It's refreshing to read something from some one who can actually, see that logically, the two is compatible, unfortunately most theist are not capable of the same logic. "Science bad urrgh",|`|d2lvgxJhaa	The spiritual stuff is optional.  You can be a scientist with or without it.  However, the best scientists (those in the Academy of Sciences in the US, or similar in other countries), tend not to believe in God or anything spiritual in large proportions (over 80%).<br>  <br>  It's easy to see why.  There's absolutely no evidence for it and scientists prefer the simplest solutions.  Putting a big sky daddy around that has, to date, not given any tangible evidence for his existence makes the world unnecessarily complicated.<br>  <br>  Science and spirituality are not incompatible in that religion makes no measurable predictions, so it can't contradict science (execpt perhaps in the creation/evolution, where it fails miserably).  However, most decent scientists tend to think that the simplest reason that religion exists is that it fulfills a human need, but was actually created by other humans not from any god.<br>  <br>  It's perfectly possible to be a practising microbiologist, and believe in Astrology, Feng Shui, goblins and other strange stuff, it's just that the best ones tend not to do that.|`|Uw1b7U83aa	Neither point of view says nothing about the other.  Science tries to explain things about our physical reality where as religion tries to explain things about our spiritual reality.  They do not overlap.  It is when the other encroaches on the territory of the other that problems arise.|`|01d4fd76ed5b517f49a55ea0f996488faa	I've heared of so many authors saying that Myths are the ancient people's explanation of the events around them. For example, there are thunders because Zeus throws them. Catholicism started in Julius Caesar's time if i'm not mistaken. Do you understand what I meant?|`|07449b5846f5049bc8771e275903857daa	But think of this: Religion is a belief in which we gain our belief from prophets and stories bibles and probably fairy tales. We believe in many religion because we feels that there's a higher power out there seeing what we do and probably helping us live our lives. We choose to believe fact from fictions thanks or no thanks to science and their theories as well as their own scientific evidence and or fact.<br>  <br>  Science has many more facts that religion is a path we choose to take because we use our spirits or energy to ascend and to pass on to the next life. However not all science believe in this most of them want to believe because of some miracles people claims is happening. <br>  <br>  For instant: If science hears that there's miracles on a certain place they go and investigate but if they find nothing or think they have a scientific evidence they will think its false and have a scientific proof that it isn't real.<br>  <br>  Science can never upstage religion because it true we do have spirits and science cant know for sure how our feelings really work and how it makes us do our daily living. Science are just theories some are facts and some are opinions of others believed to be facts.<br>  While others are just theories yet to be proven or it can never be proven and are only given by opinions.<br>  <br>  There's always a battle between religion and science many people believe that so called angel from the sky are aliens or humanoids but only if you believe that. And that the holy grail doesn't really exist that what science today are saying.<br>  <br>  Many people are slowly drawing to science and today in many place of the world they are trying to remove Jesus, God or religion out there from being used and in many places where high technologies are used.<br>  <br>  Most people who only convert themselves to science and don't believe in religion are atheist most of them don't have regard for life because they say everything dies off and comes back again on another time.<br>  <br>  So science are considered to be made part of people belief there's life beyond god and challenges gods probably would hate if we humans think ourselves as gods.<br>  <br>  Just consider that science is right and religion is half way right because of their none proof of how their religion works.|`|gcPLULdhaa	nothing is iilogical abt the idea of God at all...<br>  it is the faith u hv..belief tht sumthin u think is possible...<br>  it gives u the thrust to accomplish ur task...<br>  wen u r lonely...jus talk to a plant or a bird...ul feel relieved...its no different talkin to God...it all depends on how u think...<br>  i talk to God evry now n thn..wen im depressed or happy...<br>  it feels gud...if u believe in God..u can look at life or lives frm different perspective...if not its all material, theory..etc..i don say its not important...spirituality n science shud go side by side...|`|X5Mbhzedaa	It may be possible that knowledge will bring science to understand what we call now supranaturel phenomenas.

GF1NPlBSaa	I am a member of the Baha'i Faith, and this is what my religion teaches about the diversity of religions:<br>  <br>  "...[T]he foundations of Christianity and the religion of Bahá’u’lláh [prophet founder of the Baha'i Faith] are one. The foundations of all the divine Prophets and Holy Books are one. The difference among them is one of terminology only. Each springtime is identical with the former springtime. The distinction between them is only one of the calendar—1911, 1912 and so on. The difference between a Christian and a Bahá’í, therefore, is this: There was a former springtime, and there is a springtime now. No other difference exists because the foundations are the same. Whoever acts completely in accordance with the teachings of Christ is a Bahá’í. The purpose is the essential meaning of Christian, not the mere word. The purpose is the sun itself and not the dawning points. For though the sun is one sun, its dawning points are many. We must not adore the dawning points but worship the sun. We must adore the reality of religion and not blindly cling to the appellation Christianity. The Sun of Reality must be worshiped and followed. We must seek the fragrance of the rose from whatever bush it is blooming—whether oriental or western. Be seekers of light, no matter from which lantern [prophet] it shines forth. Be not lovers of the lantern."  ('Abdu'l-Baha, "The Promulgation of Universal Peace" pp 247-248)<br>  <br>  In other words, Baha'is believe that the many religions on Earth--Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, etc--are all different perspectives ("dawning points") of one true religion.  We must look past the perspective to the religion itself.  To that effect, however, the path that one takes to God is less important than having taken a path to begin with.

Following is my longer prepared article if you wish to search it out more.        ALL RELIGIONS ----<br>    THE WAY TO GOD??<br>  <br>         Some claim this and there is some truth in it.<br>  Having a religion is acknowling God is there in<br>  some form or other. Though some have strange<br>  ideas and some say there are many gods. Religion is<br>  a belief in a spiritual supernatural being above us.<br>  We can examine a few major and vast majority of<br>  smaller and break away groups and find absolutely<br>  opposite teachings. God is there and knowable or<br>  maybe there and not knowable. He is the one one or<br>  three in one and there are many. So where does all<br>  this confusion  leave us? Actually it leaves us lost<br>   but believing in a god is very common. The new<br>  religion - atheism, humanism based on evolution is<br>  really a belief. system. It is the religion of “no god”<br>  because it is contrary to all true scientific laws.<br>  Most religions have lots of good rules about<br>  honesty, morality and promote good  virtue even<br>  like the basics of the 10 commandments in the Holy<br>  Bible. But how can we be sure we are right with<br>  this god in this life or for the next? This is where<br>  the true teaching of Jesus as the Christ - Messiah<br>  is different to all others. The good in all others is<br>  only part of the way. The standard for eternal life is<br>  perfection and we have already failed. Jesus said “I<br>  am the way, the truth and the life no one comes to<br>  the Father but by Me”. This is adding something to<br>  all the others. He can take us to the Father, no one<br>  else has such a direct promise. We will check some<br>  more of His promises and then see if they are likely<br>  to be true. Other parts of the same Holy Book tell us <br>  no other name can save us.(Acts 4:12.) It also tells<br>  us this Jesus is actually the eternal creator living as<br>  a perfect human who chose to be born into our<br>  world to be tested as we are and live without sin.<br>  Then He was able to be the perfect sacrifice for our<br>  sins. This enabled Him to have us forgiven and<br>  even make us a child of the eternal one. This Holy<br>  book also says we get right with the One Eternal<br>  Holy God by believing this and accepting His offer.<br>  Eternal life from Him is a gift, it is given by grace<br>  as we don’t deserve it and could never earn it or be<br>  good enough to receive it.Eph 2:8-9. All we have to<br>  do is agree we have sinned, believe He died for us,<br>  taking the penalty for our sin.Then accept Him as<br>  Promised Saviour (the meaning of the name Jesus<br>  Christ) being willing with His help to turn from sin<br>  and own and follow Him. To help us do this He<br>  actually lives in us so He can work from the inside.<br>  He is no longer a god who is somewhere out there.<br>  He does not live in temples or churches made by<br>  hands but makes us His living temple. Millions are<br>  on record of having accepted Jesus for real and then<br>  know He lives within our hearts.<br>   There are many ways to know this is true.<br>  One of the important truths is that of His name. It is<br>  the name above all names because no name can be<br>  above the creator. It means “The Saviour<br>  Promised”. This Holy Book, the Holy Bible tells us<br>  about a perfect creation of the world and the first<br>  two people. They challenged him by eating a fruit<br>  which stood for knowing right from wrong. Only<br>  He could do that and once they took on His job it all<br>  started going wrong and still is today. Right then He<br>  promised a Child of the woman would come into<br>  this fallen world and defeat the evil(death) for us.<br>  There are many more promises in the Old<br>  Testament pointing out where He would be born,<br>  who His family and mother would be and what<br>  would happen to Him. These things all happened to<br>  Jesus and so we know He is the promised one. So if<br>  you believe anything that is good Jesus ic calling<br>  and saying to come to Him and He will take you all<br>  the way. At the end of time He is coming back as<br>  King of Kings and Lord of Lords when He has final<br>  victory over evil. So why cling to anyone or<br>  anything less when He is the Eternal one Himself<br>  and wants you as His child in His family to live in<br>  His beautiful eternal home forever where there is no<br>  more suffering, pain, crying, sickness or death.<br>     If you are seeking the truth read the in the Holy<br>  Bible the Gospel of John, The book of Acts and<br>  Genesis. To be saved you need to believe Jesus died<br>  on the cross taking the blame and the punishment<br>  for your sin and ask Him into your life. Be willing<br>  to turn from sin with His help. Now live for Him by<br>  worshipping God, learning of Him in His Word the<br>  Bible and owning Him before others. May God<br>  bless you as you seek the TRUTH.   nev r|`|rLc1QeVbaa	are you arguing with yourself or what? because people are going to believe what they believe.|`|xgMQcCakaa	God throughout time has organized and established his church by calling prophets and giving them authority to act in his name. people have repeatedly rejected those prophets.<br>  most Church's have some truth in them but they are missing a lot as well.

Jesus spoke of religion in a similar way.<br>  <br>  (Matthew 7:13-14) 13?"Go in through the narrow gate; because broad and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are the ones going in through it; 14?whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are the ones finding it.<br>  <br>  So not only is there only one road to life, but very few people find it, and so we can not go by the popular view in order to identify which is the right road. Jesus did give us one of the keys to identify the right course:<br>  <br>  (Matthew 7:21-23) 21?"Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will. 22?Many will say to me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many powerful works in your name?’ 23?And yet then I will confess to them: I never knew YOU! Get away from me, YOU workers of lawlessness.<br>  <br>  We could call Jesus "Lord" and even be sincere about it, but he said " the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens"  would be on the right course. Most religions today that claim to follow Jesus as "Lord"  do not give any glory to his Father, do  not use his name, or even teach that he exists. Instead the most common teaching is the Trinity; a concept never even mentioned in the Bible, and which contradicts what the Bible does teach about God and Christ. Does it make a difference what we believe?<br>  <br>  Jesus called God's word; the scriptures which he has inspired, "the truth"<br>  <br>  (John 17:17) 17?Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word is truth.<br>  <br>  (John 4:23-24) 23?Nevertheless, the hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshipers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for, indeed, the Father is looking for suchlike ones to worship him. 24?God is a Spirit, and those worshiping him must worship with spirit and truth."<br>  <br>  No you may say that "there is good in all religions" and so as long as there is some good then it is OK., but look at the situation in the first century. Wasn't there some good in Judaism then? However note what Jesus told the religious leaders then:<br>  <br>  (John 8:44) 44?YOU are from YOUR father the Devil, and YOU wish to do the desires of YOUR father. That one was a manslayer when he began, and he did not stand fast in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaks the lie, he speaks according to his own disposition, because he is a liar and the father of [the lie].<br>  <br>  The word "Devil" means "slanderer". By his lies he has caused the death of every human being who has ever lived until this day. You can find some of these demon inspired lies in most religions on earth. thus it is necessary to identify which religion is the narrow road with few on it.|`|wvGiSp3Gaa	Not all paths lead to God.

The reason people (not just atheists) point out the contradictions in the Bible is to try and get literalists to realize they have to interpret the Bible.  It is an imperfect work, compiled together over a long time by men of faith (and sometimes secular men with their own agendas), often under adverse conditions and without benefit of word processors and databases.  It's full of flaws.<br>  <br>  For me, one of the biggest example of conflict is in the conflicting creation stories in Genesis (1 & 2.)  Many literalist work hard to explain away the contradiction, but they miss the point.  They try to show that if you interpret the passages and their history they don't actually conflict; but we're saying you have to interpret the Bible (did you get that subtle nuance, there?)<br>  <br>  But the biggest conflict in the Bible has got to be the changing nature of God.  Between the Old Testament and the New Testament, God went from an involved deity who visited men (Moses on Mt. Ararat, for example) to a deity who could not become directly involved, and so sent his son to do his work, instead.  The God of the OT was jealous and vengeful, and admitted to other gods ("Thou shalt have no other god before me", for example.)  He ordered his followers to commit rape, murder, and incest.  The NT God is all loving and willing to sacrifice his beloved son for us.  The OT God was the Hebrew God, the NT God is everyone's God.  <br>  <br>  These contradictions are all perfectly explainable if you can step back and look at the Bible as a work of inspiration instead of literal truth.  Unfortunately, many Christians don't seem capable of doing that.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	The bible does contradict itself. before you get mad about my answer, also understand that it has done more good than harm, regardless of the wars, and contradictions. we, at least I'm not a scholar, so it does no good to argue the scriptures.<br>  <br>  PS Paul could have been a little more careful.|`|AA10721549	Do not kill><br>  Jericho<br>  <br>  if one text includes two versions of a situation or statement (as in you Paul vs Jesus case) it indeed IS contradictory.|`|HVY2rqzfaa	An all loving god who used to smite down anyone (including the entire population bar one family) for being bad.<br>  <br>  If that's not a contradiction I don't know what else you need...|`|7mhRDbvsaa	the bible says its holy when its a really violent book|`|4sUek7ugaa	So, the Bible has obvious contradictions but they're not really contradictions because the church says both are right and that makes them sound like contradictions even though they really aren't?<br>  <br>  That didn't make a bit of sense.

The bible is a contextual work; Christians have a habit of taking things out of context as well.  That's human nature though; to find something that, if stretched far enough, will fit your purpose.  <br>  i.e. On the website that was cited on here, one of their contradictions was that Abraham only had one son but actually had a couple.... those versus were taken out of context (chronological order?!) His wife gave birth to Isaac after he had had a child with her servant.  Isaac was the child that God had wanted him to have from the beginning but Abraham was too impatient so he looked for other sources.  Now taken out of context, it would appear that the bible contradicts itself but that's because it was spun to do so.  In actuality, the verses are perfectly legit when left in the book and the ENTIRE story is read.  <br>  No verse in the bible can stand alone because they are all built off other biblical concepts.|`|rLCx5ljQaa	The bible contradicts itself all the time, dipshit. read on.<br>  <br>  I studied the scriptures in boarding school, which is the very reason i know its a load of ****.<br>  <br>  im not gonna tell u every contradiction in the bible because u will be reading for a week.<br>  <br>  what i can tell u is that the bible was made so that spineless pricks can chop and change and **** around with interpretations and proverbs so they can tell whoever they want, whatever they want.<br>  <br>  the various authors of the bible deliberately made it ambiguous and proverb-like for this very purpose.

But if you open your bible to Ezekiel, 14;  7-11.<br>  <br>  See what God thinks about those who ask men about him, (God).<br>  <br>  Many of your answerer's have told the truth and shown  you many contradictions in the Bible.  The truth is this.  If your taught by God instead of men, you would know that there are many contradictions in the Bible.<br>  <br>  Gods true church is not of the world, but within each individuals, heart and mind.<br>  <br>  Where they, the atheists go wrong, is that they don't believe in a God or his Son.<br>  <br>  That is their free choice and no man should try to force or judge any other man, no matter what is or isn't his belief.  The only one who judges is God himself.<br>  <br>  Many don't understand that in all scriptural works, there is two churches within the words of God and of men.   One church is of Satan, which are the religions of today (visible) and the other church is of God.  (invisible). <br>  <br>  If you wish to confirm this truth, read the Covenant God made to his people and their descendants, in Hebrews 8; 10-12.    Read Rev. 3-12 and see what God shall call them.<br>  <br>  No where on earth is there a people who call themselves, the New Jerusalem.   Yet, these people know who they are, and they follow God, not false prophets.  False prophets, who've interpreted Gods words for their own purposes of material gain and favor in the eyes of their fellow consituants.  For I am just one of Gods chosen, and have met very few more who have been taught by God instead of men, for we do not gather or preach or judge.  For Gods truth is above and beyond mens worldly truths.<br>  <br>  Upon leaving the churches of man, I've learned this through Gods Son, Jesus Christ, who he sends as the comforter, who verifies truth.  Gods truth, which is upside down from what men teach, but worldly followers of false prophets will never abandon their teachers and such, for their faith is weak and they are like sheep as they continue in the false practise of their father's father, and follow men, instead of having true faith and following Christ's example of how to follow and trust in God as he did.<br>  <br>  Jesus Christ, is the first of Gods, church which is invisible to those who seek signs and such.  There are many of Gods Sons on earth today, for I am just one of very few who shall survive the day of the Lord which is slowly moving upon us, but like Christ's disciples, at the wedding, they are to busy enjoying the world, that surrounds them and will miss the miracles happening all around, for they are enjoying the feast and all their noteriety from their peers.
AA10589243	I am not celebrating Lent , as it is a pagan teaching.<br>  A false teaching that God does NOT approve of.<br>  <br>  According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, “the real aim of Lent is, above all else, to prepare men for the celebration of the death and Resurrection of Christ…''<br>  <br>  On the surface, this belief sounds sincere. However, it does not agree with the Bible, God’s Holy Word, the only source of true spiritual knowledge and understanding.<br>  <br>  Lent was never observed by Christ or His apostles.<br>  <br>  Lent was not observed by the first century Church! It was first addressed by the church at Rome during the Council of Nicea in A.D. 325, when Emperor Constantine officially recognized that church as the Roman Empire’s state religion.<br>  <br>  <br>  Coming from the Anglo-Saxon Lencten, meaning “spring,” Lent originated in the ancient Babylonian mystery religion. “The forty days’ abstinence of Lent was directly borrowed from the worshippers of the Babylonian goddess…Among the Pagans this Lent seems to have been an indispensable preliminary to the great annual festival in commemoration of the death and resurrection of Tammuz” (The Two Babylons).<br>  <br>  Tammuz was the false Messiah of the Babylonians.<br>  <br>  <br>  Thats why I don't follow Lent , and neither will anyone that wishes to please the true God of the Bible , -- Jehovah. !|`|A71U6gNtaa	i borrowed Fish and Vegetables so I can eat them cuz it's the start of lent then soon i will turn it back LOL|`|xZet9Dunaa	What would you borrow?

mRLYY14Yaa	Sheer determination by the govt and the Chinese people to succeed at no matter what cost. What ever else may be said about the Communist, when they want things done, they get it done!<br>  Unlike India, where I think democracy is actually a hinder in this aspect, where it causes a lot of squabbling and so much discussions and talk, that it's hard to get things moving in the same directions, let alone a lightening fast speed. Different Indians in different parts of India have their own agendas, no?<br>  <br>  Another reason would be the early start, notice China dominates in manufacturing? But it could not have been done without the overseas Chinese and the fact that China had Hong Kong and even to a certain extent, Taiwan (contrary to popular belief, Taiwanese and mainlanders get along fine) who were well-advanced city-states. These outside Chinese people brought connections/technology and know how back to the mainland and helped kick start the whole process.<br>  <br>  Well that's some of the reasons...|`|Um52yp60aa	i thought they were both really poor, i don't think there is that munch of a difference. maybe because in india  they still have those 'castes' that's discriminate alot of people and really poor people because of that dont have the chance to have a better life|`|GbGP60jsaa	Depends on how you look at it.

Yes indeed, the enlightened will always be seen as rebels to those who treasure material life.<br>  <br>  And the reason is simple... the enlightened see AND LIVE the riches that the unenlightened cannot see and do not live... so to the average person, an enlightened man will appear to be a bit "nuts." But that is due to their own blindness.<br>  <br>  And surprisingly, this is the VERY subject that comes up in the words of Christ. He was speaking of those who cannot see. And he was pleading with people to become "Children of the light."<br>  <br>  But unfortunately, we see what happened.

m4guclgYaa	The Apostles did not have the Holy Spirit to give them revelation and insight prior to Christ's death.   They understood next to nothing about the true nature of Jesus when He was walking with them, but gained all the insight and revelation on the Day of Pentecost concerning what Jesus taught and did while He was alive, and about what He taught and did the 40 days He spent with them after His resurrection.  The Apostles had direct experience and hindsight, and everything we know about Jesus is based on what the Apostles wrote and taught the early Christians.  They knew more after Jesus' death than we know now, but we also now have more revaluation concerning the end time prophesies and the details of the functioning of the Holy Spirit than the Apostles did because we have about 2000 years of experience working with Jesus through the Holy Spirit and understand a great deal more through the mistakes, successes, and experiences of Christians over the millennnia.|`|NLinPsyhaa	Lakely, the apostles didn't understand till after His resurrection and the day of Pentecost. And if we understand it now, it's because THEY WROTE IT DOWN!|`|YOGgHoNdaa	Put simply .  . .Hind sight is 20/20!|`|AA11232725	The Apostles didn't understand the prophecies concerning the Messiah having to die and be raised from the dead until after it happened.<br>  <br>  Luke 18:31  Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be accomplished.  32  For He will be delivered to the Gentiles and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon.  33  They will scourge  Him and kill Him. And the third day He will rise again."  34  But they understood none of these things; this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know the things which were spoken.<br>  <br>  Even when Jesus had the passover meal with his Apostles they still didn't get it and were arguing about being first in the earthly Kingdom they thought the Messiah had come to bring.<br>  <br>  Luke 22:19-20  And He took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me."  20  Likewise He also took the cup after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is shed for you.<br>  <br>  ...24  Now there was also a dispute among them, as to which of them should be considered the greatest.  25  And He said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called 'benefactors.'  26  But not so among you; on the contrary, he who is greatest among you, let him be as the younger, and he who governs as he who serves.  27  For who is greater, he who sits at the table, or he who serves? Is it not he who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as the One who serves.  28  "But you are those who have continued with Me in My trials.  29  And I bestow upon you a kingdom, just as My Father bestowed one upon Me,  30  that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel."<br>  <br>  It wasn't until Jesus was crucified and rose from the dead that He was finally able to explain it to them. The "good news" is not only that the Lord Jesus died for our sins. It's that He rose from the dead after dying for our sins.<br>  <br>  Luke 24:15 So it was, while they conversed and reasoned, that Jesus Himself drew near and went with them.  16  But their eyes were restrained, so that they did not know Him.  17  And He said to them, "What kind of conversation is this that you have with one another as you walk and are sad?"  <br>  <br>  18  Then the one whose name was Cleopas answered and said to Him, "Are You the only stranger in Jerusalem, and have You not known the things which happened there in these days?"  19  And He said to them, "What things?" So they said to Him, "The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a Prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,  20  and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and crucified Him.  21  But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, today is the third day since these things happened.  22  Yes, and certain women of our company, who arrived at the tomb early, astonished us.  23  When they did not find His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said He was alive.  24  And certain of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but Him they did not see."  <br>  <br>  25  Then He said to them, "O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!  26  Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into His glory?"  27  And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 15:17  And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.<br>  <br>  What Jesus said to the women about weeping had to do with what was going to happen to Christians and to Jerusalem after Jesus went back to Heaven. It had nothing to do with Him fulfilling the prophecies and instituting the New Covenant with His blood.<br>  <br>  Hebrews 10:11  Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.  12  But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God.  13  Since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool,  14  because by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.  15  The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says:  16  "This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds."  17  Then he adds: "Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more."  18  And where these have been forgiven, there is no longer any sacrifice for sin.
Qun4OXeLaa	Light has come to the World:  only Spirit gives birth to spirit:<br>  <br>  John 3:1-21<br>  1Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council. 2He came to Jesus at night and said, "Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him."<br>  <br>   3In reply Jesus declared, "I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again."<br>  <br>   4"How can a man be born when he is old?" Nicodemus asked. "Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!"<br>  <br>   5Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. 6Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. 7You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.' 8The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit."<br>  <br>   9"How can this be?" Nicodemus asked.<br>  <br>   10"You are Israel's teacher," said Jesus, "and do you not understand these things? 11I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. 12I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? 13No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven—the Son of Man. 14Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, 15that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.<br>  <br>   16"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. 19This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. 20Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. 21But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God."<br>  -----------------<br>  <br>  The Last Supper/ The Holy Communion:  Jesus Christ's Body is Broken and Blood Shed:<br>  <br>  Mark 14:12-26<br>  12On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"<br>  <br>   13So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him. 14Say to the owner of the house he enters, 'The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' 15He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there."<br>  <br>   16The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.<br>  <br>   17When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve. 18While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me—one who is eating with me."<br>  <br>   19They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, "Surely not I?"<br>  <br>   20"It is one of the Twelve," he replied, "one who dips bread into the bowl with me. 21The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."<br>  <br>   22While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take it; this is my body."<br>  <br>   23Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, and they all drank from it.<br>  <br>   24"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many," he said to them. 25"I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God."<br>  <br>   26When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.<br>  ----------------------------<br>  <br>  Those two are from the Gospels and aren't from the letters of Paul to the early churches.  The "shedding of blood" isn't Pauline in source.  Paul, since he was originally a persecutor of Christians and through this, also a persecutor of Jesus Christ before his conversion, must have felt the guilt of having persecuted the only begotten Son of God.  Yet, being such a sinner, he not only received forgiveness but was also given a commission equal to the Apostles.  I'd say he, Paul, is always conscious of this and it fills his writings.<br>  ---------------------<br>  <br>  The Conversion, and Jesus Christ's Unspoken Forgiveness, of Paul(Saul):<br>  <br>  Acts 9:1-20<br>  1Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord's disciples. He went to the high priest 2and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem. 3As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. 4He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"<br>  <br>   5"Who are you, Lord?" Saul asked.<br>  <br>     "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting," he replied. 6"Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do."<br>  <br>   7The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless; they heard the sound but did not see anyone. 8Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus. 9For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything.<br>  <br>   10In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, "Ananias!"<br>        "Yes, Lord," he answered.<br>  <br>   11The Lord told him, "Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying. 12In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight."<br>  <br>   13"Lord," Ananias answered, "I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem. 14And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name."<br>  <br>   15But the Lord said to Ananias, "Go! This man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before the Gentiles and their kings and before the people of Israel. 16I will show him how much he must suffer for my name."<br>  <br>   17Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord—Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here—has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit." 18Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized, 19and after taking some food, he regained his strength.<br>      Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus.|`|m4guclgYaa	Perfectly.  Remember, the "Pauline doctirne" originated with Christ, not Paul.  The necesity of Jesus' blood sacrifice is in perfect harmony with teh Old Testament sacrificial system and put an end to it.

When you are in public or on others turf you are "guest" it is that simple. Treat others as you would have them treat you. If your going to light up around others it would be polite to ask first if it would offend anyone. If it is in a designated smoking area that is what it is there for do it. Some things we are expected to tolerate as a society such as a crying non-paying infant on a aircraft next to you when you are a paying passenger. If things get to bad you could complain and possibly be moved or given a discount but it is tolerated when beyond personal control. The smoker or boom box or fish bag are with in the control of the person doing the action. Laws are passed when inconsiderate people fail to respect the spaces of others. It doesn't mean the people are bad unless they deliberately do it to offend you. It may be they are unaware, thoughtless, unschooled or handicapped not just rude. We can usually tell however the rude ones when confronted and they continue their obnoxious behavior. If one feels he is in the right he could always state he feels he has the right, but consent to the others wishes anyway by being a gentlemen and out of kindness. This could put him on higher ground then the person claiming to be offended and defuse hostility.

4hsl2toNaa	If I may be so bold as to compare a certain religious group to Jesus's preaching.  <br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses do as Jesus did.  They do not teach mainstream beliefs, but the word of God.  We are footstep followers of Christ and teach the good news of the Kingdom, just as Jesus did.  Many think ill of us but those sheep like ones we meet in the ministry know the truth when they hear it and come into the fold.  If it were not for Holy Spirit we could not reach the hearts of those nor would we be able to do the preaching work.  <br>  Good question.

He had to teach with authority because who would have believe Him if He didn't. And yes, He came to steer up controversy among the people. To make them think of what He was saying to them. Here was a Man who seemed like He had no back round and He was teaching to the scribes and chief priests in their temple, telling them what to do. Anyone of authority would take issue with this being that we are human and think of ourselves as being right. Of course they didn't like it at all. They also had no idea who they were talking too. Thinking Him only a Man. God bless you.

As for putting people to die and such, Jews are no longer under the law to kill because of those sins and Gentiles never were, BUT they are still sin according to the bible.<br>  <br>  The new order for now Gentiles and Jews alike is to believe in Christ and repent. "The wages of sin is death" yet because Christ died for us, we dont have to physically die to atone for our sins, we believe and follow Him and our sins are washed clean, but dont be fooled, they are still sins.|`|96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	You should also tell them to read this part of their Bible dear :<br>  <br>  John the "disciple whom Jesus loved" (John 13:23, 19:26, 21:7,20)|`|AA12213253	I'm sure rapes were taking place along with every other perversion but  the PRIMARY sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was homosexuality.  Lot had 2 daughters who were both married (Genesis19:14) yet were virgins (Genesis 19:8). That tells me that Lot's sons in law became as gay as the rest of the city. It sure doesn't mention that they were raped at all.  <br>  <br>  "You shall not lie with a male as with a woman. It is an abomination." Leviticus 18:22<br>  Abomination = something abominable; detestable;worthy of causing disgust or hatred.<br>  <br>  "Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created." - Genesis 5:2<br>  <br>  God created Male and Female for each other as husband and wife.

I have not read or heard ONE WORD about this woman's faith.  If she's a Christian or a Muslim or a Pixie, she has a funny way of showing us her ... "faith."  So, WHY would you bring up her faith at all?  She hasn't!<br>  <br>  2. Logic is connecting A to B to derive at C.  The pro-life crowd says simply.

Pretty simple, right?<br>  <br>  NOW ... this women went to SCIENCE which so many non-Christians seem to believe in as their own personal God.  Science is bound by no morality, no sense of right and wrong.  SCIENCE said, we can make not 1, not 2, but 5, 6, 8, or even 10 babies for you in a lab.  You likey?  And she said, "Me likey a lot!"  <br>  <br>  And yes, she WANTED THE BABIES!!!  What does someone wanting a baby have to do with the pro-life/pro-choice debate?!?!?!?!?!  It's all about people making babies who then want to kill them!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Let's face it ... had there been a story on Corn Flakes, you could have twisted it into an anti-Christian message.

AA11156135	That's greek mythology.<br>  <br>  Some would say that in the O.T. demons had sex with women. Prior to Noah.<br>  <br>  Here's the verse and a commentary.<br>  In Genesis 6:1-4 the "sons of God" are captivated by the beauty of the "daughters of men." They subsequently marry them and produce an offspring of giants known as the Nephilim. Genesis goes on to say that these Nephilim were "mighty men" and "men of renown." <br>  <br>  In the Old Testament, the designation "sons of God" (bene Elohim) is never used of humans, but always of supernatural beings that are higher than man but lower than God. To fit such a category only one species is known--angels. And the term "sons of God" applies to both good and bad angels.|`|nYRkAmdtaa	Have you had something climbing into your body , the god needs to know what it is like .|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	I'm certainly willing to try, if your avatar is indeed yours.|`|503991d7e18cf8ad3b3864e35df39ec3aa	Depends on what you mean by "God".<br>  few hundreds of years ago, up until now .. humans believed that :<br>  <br>  - their kings and queens are Gods. <br>  - Believers/followers of Gods are ( spiritual ) Sons and daughter of Gods <br>  - Nature is God<br>  - Spirits of the dead are Gods<br>  - Aliens/Angels were called Gods<br>  - Humans with supernatural powers are Gods<br>  <br>  however, if you are talking about God of the jews/christians/muslims ..<br>  then the simple answer would be ... yes. the result is known by the name "Jesus" the Christ !|`|96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	Yes dear, greek Gods did it all the time.

There are verses that are taken out of context  about angels have sex with humans,  like in Gen 6 v 1.  All it is saying that the people who believed in God sinned and had sex with women who didnt know about God.  People read that wrong and think it's angels have sex,  which is really stupid, because they just dont read the whole bible.   The scriptures tells us that angels were made immortal, sinless and perfect.   It also says that angels dont marry, have babies and sex.|`|IAl0czH9aa	Anything can be god.It is possible BUT NOT WITH THE ALMIGHTY GOD.|`|JsGX1bfRaa	We are God's CHILDREN. That fact alone should tell anyone that God does not and will not have sex with humans.<br>  <br>  Humans have sex organs, God does not. He created sex organs so humans will enjoy the act of procreation. Procreation is supposed to be the highest expression of love between two humans so God wanted humans to feel rapturous when they procreate. God does not procreate. He simply creates.<br>  <br>  God gets His pleasure from people making a sincere effort to honor Him and His ways out of their own free will. That is showing love to God. That is really all He asks of us (although it is not always easy!). In return we get to spend eternity with Him in heaven.<br>  <br>  In the case of the Virgin Mary, she is exactly that, a virgin. The Holy Spirit miraculously fertilized an egg in her womb and that fertilized egg gestated and was born and that baby was Jesus.<br>  <br>  If you don't believe in miracles then you can't believe in God because life itself is a miracle.|`|laB6LNXLaa	The son's of God came down to earth, and then had sex with humans.

Good looking and shy, people think you are stuck up and treat you wose than a shy ugly person.|`|pbqsiqt2aa	I don't know what is good-looking to you, but for me, it is neatness and decency. I wouldn't think a man with unshaven beard, greasy hair all over the place wearing a jacket that stinks would get a chance of getting a job, a relationship, and is unlikely to be confident, just because of the way he presents himself.<br>  While on the other hand, a man with combed hair, nice posture, that smiles, it shows he has good manners, making him likely to be friendly with me and be aware of my own feelings. I'd like him to stick around. Now I don't mean "Hot" people, just decent good-looking as opposed to bad-looking people. :/

T5DbLLgQaa	Learning language well requires being as active as possible and making the learning fun for yourself. Taking lessons is always important, but equally important are these:<br>  <br>  1) Listen/watch: Listen to internet radio stations, watch TV shows that are in your "target language" (use only subtitles, NOT voice dubbing!), etc.<br>  <br>  2) Write/communicate: Try to find discussion forums from the web about things that you find interesting (music/various artists, hobbies, etc.) and start communicating there with other people using your target language. Start using instant messaging systems in case you find some new friends or start emailing them.<br>  <br>  3) Buy yourself a proper dictionary, and each time when you see a strange word that you do not understand, look it up.<br>  <br>  The main point in ANY language learning is to make it as fun as possible for yourself.

The universe originated from particles that went out in a massive expansion.  I don't think that it came from nothing, but from particles.<br>  <br>  2. Order originated from gravity taking affect.  As the particles zoomed outward, gravity started to pull them together forming balls of mass, that later became planets, satellites, and all the other bodies of mass associated with space. <br>  <br>  3. Life originated in the primordial soup where there were many different elements that combined with electricity made the first molecules that would be the first life and would evolve to be everything we see today.<br>  <br>  4. The cause for people is the same for any other organism on this planet, to reproduce.  People,  especially religious people have the biggest problem with this because they think we should have some divine purpose, and we don't.  Get over yourself.<br>  <br>  5. No, there are certain features in the human body, along with other animals on this planet that shows we have evolved from other creatures.  For example, why do we have a tale bone?  An appendix?  The tale bone is left over from when we had tales, the appendix was used as another stomach to digest mainly plants.

Failure to understand that in thermodynamics probabilities are not fixed entities has led to a misinterpretation that is responsible for the wide- spread and totally false belief that the second law of thermodynamics does not permit order to spontaneously arise from disorder. In fact, there are many examples in nature where order does arise spontaneously from disorder:  Snowflakes with their six-sided crystalline symmetry are formed spontaneously from randomly moving water vapor molecules. Salts with precise planes of crystalline symmetry form spontaneously when water evaporates from a solution.*<br>  <br>  3.

I encourage you to research why Lent was started and what all the rituals mean, its very powerful. God Bless!!!

It recalls the 40 days Christ spent in the wilderness, during which he was tempted to sin. Christians fast and pray during this period, recalling our own sins and preparing for the feast of our redemption. It is part of the great annual drama and spiritual pilgrimage of the Church year culminating in Good Friday and Easter.|`|onkUcy19aa	The Season of Lent<br>  <br>  Theme: <br>  Retreating Into the Wilderness with Jesus <br>  Dates: <br>  Lent is a forty-day period before Easter. It begins on Ash Wednesday. We skip Sundays when we count the forty days, because Sundays commemorate the Resurrection. Lent begins on 25 February 2009 and ends on 11 April 2009, which is the day before Easter. <br>  In the Roman Catholic Church, Lent officially ends at sundown on 9 April (Holy Thursday), with the beginning of the mass of the Lord’s Supper.<br>  <br>  Colors: <br>  In most churches, the decorations are purple, the royal color, to prepare for the King. You can read more about color in worship <br>  Scripture Readings: <br>  The Revised Common Lectionary appoints Scripture readings for use in worship during the Season of Lent. <br>  The East: <br>  In Orthodox churches, this season is called the Great Lent. It begins on Clean Monday. <br>  Special Days: <br>  Ash Wednesday, 25 February 2009 <br>  The Annunciation, 25 March <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Lent is a season of soul-searching and repentance. It is a season for reflection and taking stock. Lent originated in the very earliest days of the Church as a preparatory time for Easter, when the faithful rededicated themselves and when converts were instructed in the faith and prepared for baptism. By observing the forty days of Lent, the individual Christian imitates Jesus’ withdrawal into the wilderness for forty days. All churches that have a continuous history extending before AD 1500 observe Lent. The ancient church that wrote, collected, canonized, and propagated the New Testament also observed Lent, believing it to be a commandment from the apostles. (See The Apostolic Constitutions, Book V, Section III.) <br>  <br>  If your church does not observe Lent, you can find out why.<br>  <br>  You can read about fasting, which is a spiritual discipline that does not involve starvation or dehydration. You can also read Honest to God for an explanation of what we accomplish by observing Lent.<br>  <br>  You can find out about Lenten fasting during medieval times. The link even includes a very interesting recipe!<br>  <br>  The Western Church<br>  Because Sunday is the day of the Resurrection, we skip over Sundays when we calculate the length of Lent. Therefore, in the Western Church, Lent always begins on Ash Wednesday, the seventh Wednesday before Easter.<br>  <br>  In many countries, the last day before Lent (called Mardi Gras, Shrove Tuesday, Carnival, or Fasching) has become a last fling before the solemnity of Lent. For centuries, it was customary to fast by abstaining from meat during Lent, which is why some people call the festival Carnival, which is Latin for farewell to meat.<br>  <br>  The Eastern Church<br>  The Eastern Church does not skip over Sundays when calculating the length of the Great Lent. Therefore, the Great Lent always begins on Clean Monday, the seventh Monday before Easter, and ends on the Friday before Palm Sunday—using of course the eastern date for Easter. The Lenten fast is relaxed on the weekends in honor of the Sabbath (Saturday) and the Resurrection (Sunday). The Great Lent is followed by Lazarus Saturday and Palm Sunday, which are feast days, then the Lenten fast resumes on Monday of Holy Week. Technically, in the Eastern Church, Holy Week is a separate season from the Great Lent.<br>  <br>  Special Days<br>  The purpose of the liturgical calendar is to relive the major events in Jesus’ life in real time, which is why Lent is forty days long. If Jesus were born on 25 December, then His conception—thus also His incarnation—would have been nine months earlier, on about 25 March. That is when the angel Gabriel would have announced Jesus’ birth to Mary. Thus 25 March is known in the historic church as The Annunciation. <br>  <br>  Roughly speaking, the western Church consists of Protestants, Catholics, and Anglicans. The eastern Church consists of the Eastern Orthodox churches, the Oriental Orthodox churches, and the eastern-rite churches affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  You can download a printable version of this page to use as a hand-out or a bulletin insert.<br>  <br>  Other Seasons<br>  Advent | Christmas | Epiphany | Holy Week | Easter | After Pentecost|`|VFWRdAH3aa	Lent is a time of repentance and prayer.

The child feels miserable at that time but it was for his good in long run.<br>  <br>  Better don't pray for things that you feel you need.

He has been given Injil and been help by Hawariyyun. <br>  <br>  We didn't belive Jesus has been crucified, but we believe Jesus place has been replaced by somobody that perfectly resemble Jesus, until "even Mary can't recognized that is false Jesus"<br>  <br>  Jesus isn't God. Yes, he has been born miraculously (like Adam and Eve). Yes, he has given miracles (like Bone of Elisha has been bring a dead people to life). <br>  <br>  But he is not God, but indeed call people to worship God.<br>  <br>  Allah didn't allow people to called Jesus as the Son of God again because the Gentiles Christian misinterpret the words. <br>  <br>  Actually, Angels, Israelites, David also been called as Son of God. But Hebrew people used that term to refer to people that Allah loved, not literally Son of God. <br>  <br>  Christian differentiate "THE Son of God and A Son of God" concept to prove Jesus is god, even though Hebrew didn't differentiate it.<br>  <br>  Here is my resources: <br>  And you can follow. To know better, you can go to the al-Quran verses at the bottom.|`|AORcLwTNaa	Jesus was not God or the son of God. God has no children or family, Jesus was the son of the Virgin Mary. he was a prophet .|`|E870WbAsaa	Jesus (may peace be upon him) was a mighty prophet of GOD, who did miracles with the permission of GOD   :)<br>  <br>  <br>  I am muslim<br>  <br>  Love n Peace   :)|`|iXI7n6Gmaa	Jesus (pbuh) is the last prophet and messenger to the Israelites in a very long chain of prophets.<br>  <br>  He was given miracles to prove his messenger-ship from God his virgin birth from no father is itself a sign.<br>  <br>  Any woman can say here is a baby I gave birth to and I had known no man, she will be stoned. what protected her is that the few day baby spoke as a great miracle. As it is described in Chapter 19 (Named Maryam):<br>  <br>  19:15 And make mention of Mary in the Scripture, when she had withdrawn from her people to a chamber looking East, <br>  19:16 And had chosen seclusion from them. Then We sent unto her Our spirit and it assumed for her the likeness of a perfect man. <br>  19:17 She said: Lo! I seek refuge in the Beneficent One from thee, if thou art God fearing. <br>  19:18 He said: I am only a messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee a faultless son. <br>  19:19 She said: How can I have a son when no mortal hath touched me, neither have I been unchaste! <br>  19:20 He said: So (it will be). Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me. And (it will be) that We may make of him a revelation for mankind and a mercy from Us, and it is a thing ordained. <br>  19:21 And she, conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a place. <br>  19:22 And the pangs of childbirth drove her unto the trunk of the palm tree. She said: Oh, would that I had died ere this and had become a thing of naught, forgotten! <br>  19:23 Then (one) cried unto her from below her, saying: Grieve not! Thy Lord hath placed a rivulet beneath thee, <br>  19:24 And shake the trunk of the palm tree toward thee, thou wilt cause ripe dates to fall upon thee. <br>  19:25 So eat and drink and be consoled. And if thou meetest any mortal, say: Lo! I have vowed a fast unto the Beneficent, and may not speak this day to any mortal. <br>  19:26 Then she brought him to her own folk, carrying him. They said: O Mary! Thou hast come with an amazing thing. <br>  19:27 Oh sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a wicked man nor was thy mother a harlot. <br>  19:28 Then she pointed to him. They said How can we tale to one who is in the cradle, a young boy? <br>  19:29 He spake: Lo! I am the slave of Allah. He hath given me the Scripture and hath appointed me a Prophet, <br>  19:30 And hath made me blessed wheresoever I may be, and hath enjoined upon me prayer and alms giving so long as I remain alive, <br>  19:31 And (hath made me) dutiful toward her who bore me, and hath not made me arrogant, unblest. <br>  19:32 Peace on me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive! <br>  19:33 Such was Jesus, son of Mary: (this is) a statement of the truth concerning which they doubt. <br>  19:34 It befitteth not (the Majesty of) Allah that He should take unto Himself a son. Glory be to Him! When He decreeth a thing, He saith unto it only: Be! and it is. <br>  19:35 And lo! Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So serve Him. That is the right path. <br>  19:36 The sects among them differ: but woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting of an awful Day.<br>  <br>  It is mentioned in the Quran also that they plotted to crucify and kill him, but they think that and God raised him. <br>  The traditions also state that he will come back and fight the antichrist and rule for 40 years a just rule then he will die normal death and then the destruction of the universe becomes so near maybe few decades after that who knows; no one exactly!|`|rHqe7oMoaa	ugh You're just asking for reams of copypasta.|`|ms0eYsD5aa	he is god

We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, untill the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:  Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of an private interpretation.

Religious leaders that were so corrupt that Jesus had to come here and straighten things out? There are many things I could point out that show that man's limited knowledge of things play out in the bible...like Genesis 1:14-19. God created light. The greater light that governs the day is, of course, the sun. What is the lesser light that governs the night? What? The Moon you say? Wrong. The moon does not give off its own light, it is a reflection of the sun. During the days that the old testament was written, they did not have the technology to know that. God knew that and yet He still let them put that false bit of information in there. There are others also.<br>  If there were 12 Apostle's, then why were the teachings of just 4 put in the bible? That is just 1/3 of the people who actually knew and studied with Jesus. The majority of them were not put in there because they spoke of a more mystical and, yes, HUMAN Jesus that walked the earth. Those other books were hidden away, so the Jesus the church wanted people to know is the only one they could know.<br>  I believe the bible is a great history book and teaching tool, but not completely true. Man has touched it, therefore it is defiled.|`|91d4fbc3c75e4f7b862432c431187afcaa	Yes I believe all these miracles happened, But you said that men parted the sea, men did not parted the sea, God did it through Moses. You have to also see that some verses in the bible is a type & shadow of something, & also some are parables. When it comes to the 4 gospels, each men wrote it in their own words as God lead them to write it, & even though it is in their own words as God dealt with them, It all comes down to the same revelation of the word of God. Example, let's say you & I both were at the same location, & I said it was a cloudy day, & you say the sun never came out, I had said one thing & you had said another thing, but they both mean the samething. The sun did not come out because it was a cloudy day.|`|AA11365342	Wow.  You covered a LOT of topics in what you wrote...there's no way I could adequately respond to each point.  Allow me to comment on  what you said about the "suspension of the natural world".  If you are an atheist, please imagine (for a moment) that there is a God and consider these thoughts:<br>  <br>  In performing "miracles" (some of the things you referenced above), is God transcending the laws of physics?  If there truly is a Creator/God...a  being who created and ordained the laws of physics...it would seem to be a minor thing if he chose to at times superseded those laws.  <br>  <br>  However, in considering a "miraculous act" how are we to determine if the laws of physics have been violated or not?  In performing the miraculous, God might not be acting outside the laws of physics...it <br>  may simply appear that way from our vantage point (or limited knowledge).<br>  <br>  The Bible claims to be inspired by God.  Would it be difficult for an omnipotent being to ensure that the message He wanted to convey was not lost?   Nope.  Is that inspiration something I can prove to you?  No again.  The Bible is an amazing book.  However, it is only "life-changing" for those who are touched via faith....|`|V2Rl90PEaa	"Bible Accuracy" is an oxymoron.

czdCtTvWaa	Planning a romantic birthday party for your boyfriend is a special way to say how much you care about him. Such a party depends entirely on his wants and needs, as guys find different things romantic. if you have the resources and know exactly what kind of celebration he would consider to be romantic, do what it takes to make his birthday one to remember.<br>  <br>  1.Figure out when the opportune time to host a party will be, and get invitations out to friends if you plan on having guests. If it will just be you and your boyfriend. then you should make sure that you can plan on a time when he is available to attend. Set the date on a calendar and start planning the party. <br>  <br>  2. Find out exactly what your boyfriend considers to be romantic. While you may think that candles and chocolate equal romance, his idea of a romantic party might be themed after his favorite sports team. It's not that he thinks the team itself is romantic, but instead that the idea of you caring enough to set up a party that he'll love is terribly romantic. If you have no idea what he considers romantic, just ask him.<br>  <br>  3. Make the entire event revolve around your boyfriend. There is something incredibly romantic about one person devoting a lot of time and energy to another person, and if you can keep the focus on him then it will be much more romantic than if you made it a generic party filled with things you like but he doesn't care for. In other words, make him feel like a king. <br>  <br>  4. If you are intimate with your boyfriend, you may want to consider skipping a party with guests and instead having a romantic interlude in the bedroom complete with whatever his heart desires. Hang a "Happy Birthday" banner above the bed and chances are it will be the best birthday party he ever had. <br>  <br>  5. Don't force the romance. The last thing you want to do is to burst into tears at your boyfriend's party because he's not being romantic enough despite all your efforts. You can't force romance to happen, but you can nudge it along with some effort.

Nurses work in medicine, not magic and this should never take place instead of or over proper medical care.  Again, if it is something the patient requests this is OK but otherwise it should never be allowed.  Firstly, it would be assuming a patients religious belief match their own.  Also, if it takes time away from the provision of proper medical attention then they are not caring for the patient properly - and other patients may suffer for the time they spend on this.  Hospitals are not places of god, he cures and heals no-one, doctors and nurses do.<br>  <br>  This makes me think of a question someone here once asked "Why is it when someone is cured in hospital they thank their god or Jesus, but if something goes wrong they sue the doctor?"  If a nurse is spending time on prayer or spiritual healing then there is a good chance she is neglecting something else.  If the patient is healed they may thank the nurse for her prayers and credit god for the work - but if it doesn't work who's going to pay?<br>  <br>  So unless a patient specifically requests such things they should not happen|`|t88527U1aa	If the patient wants it yes. The nurse needs to be respect full and honor the believes of the pt first! I work in the medical field I pray with my patients often. I believe God has given us medicine and gives us insight to what is going on with people. I think its foolish not to use prayed and medicine both have a part in healing process!|`|83t9G4gcaa	Only in a church-funded hospital. Otherwise, a patient may think it is voodoo being practiced.<br>  <br>  I'd like to think my care providers are relying on science, not religion for my recovery/healing.|`|io7nHB3Oaa	Penicillin will do a lot more good than prayer, but whatever floats their boat.<br>  Though honestly, if a patient sees their nurse praying over them it's going to freak them out. It's a de facto admission by the nurse that you're screwed.|`|5AbCtkWFaa	1)  The possessive form is "their," not "there."<br>  <br>  2) Only if the patient consents.<br>  <br>  3) As long as the nurse engages in actual nursing work and doesn't rely solely on prayer to heal his/her patient.|`|cVPq3s9zaa	In every hospital room there should be a "NO PRAYING" plaque on the wall.<br>  <br>  *sigh* in a perfect world, maybe.|`|b8sOjfOsaa	Their duty is to serve their patients. They should do it with full dedication and enthusiasm.|`|hdFn4Dobaa	Yes, it is for healing.|`|256c7fa4dd43bc31257868a87b80f3a9aa	I'd rather they didn't offer.  People have their own values regarding religion.  If someone offered to pray over me it would creep me out and I'd let them know..   Which may in turn affect the nursing care I was given.<br>  <br>  Nope, hospitals are for healing the body, schools are for teaching the mind and CHURCHES are for those that CHOOSE.  <br>  <br>  Don't make choices for me in my spiritual life.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|iLnKIpbxaa	As long as they're doing their jobs properly and not relying on prayer alone to fix me up, I don't care. Are they praying in private, or are they standing over my hospital bed praying out loud? Because that might just get a little annoying.|`|IIxy6ATwaa	By all means.

dFBccLExaa	I was wondering the same thing. I was amazed when I got onto y!a how many people wanted to become mermaids. I thought, surely there is a tv show or something that is causing this. <br>  After much searching, I found a show called H2O Just Add Water. I guess it's about these three girls that somehow get turned into mermaids,  and use these powers to do who the hell knows. <br>  So I"m guessing ta'ts part of the craze. Usually, when a group of people wants to turn into something else, you need look no further than the television or recent books.|`|XUrgcOMDaa	Probably because that is the mystical creature that appeals to them the most.<br>  <br>  Some people liked being a princess the best, others riding off on a unicorn, or maybe walking into Narnia...<br>  <br>  When I was little I wanted to be a fairy so bad.  <br>  <br>  Whatever you like best, they are just nice fantasies that are more magical and colorful than real life, at times.<br>  <br>  And there's nothing wrong with a little escape now and then.  :)|`|bYDVTv7Maa	Some people watch way too much H20.<br>  <br>  Others want to be pretty, mystical and magical.<br>  <br>  Still no matter which of the above you are, chances are, you don't have a grip on reality.|`|bMVJkCShaa	... and this is coming from the girl with the username "Mermaidgirl"..?<br>  <br>  Why not just go scuba diving?

tyvFUPOxaa	Only the US Government does not believe UFOs exist... As for aliens, there is a growing probability that other life forms exist in our Universe. But God is not an alien to what he created. And with regard to her abduction, for some, I suppose doing scientific experiments upon a stripper would be interesting, as interesting as any other human specimen, once the terms were met--usually. However all of the sightings and alleged abductions may not be false.<br>  <br>  The Chariots of the Gods have been written about and a lot of ancient art works of apparent space travelers does exist in caves and other places throughout Earth; and this has challenged a lot of people for many centuries.<br>  <br>  As a Christian, along with believing in God, I believe in Angels, too.

Anything you see airborne that you can't identify is, by definition, a UFO.  At least until someone identifies it as a trick of the light or a trash bag floating on the wind.<br>  <br>  As for "aliens" putting us here on earth, it's no less crazy than all the other religions out there.  An extraterrestrial is merely a being who does not come from Earth.  If your "god" does not come and is not of this Earth, than wouldn't he be an alien?<br>  <br>  As for whether there is life on other planets, I'm sure there is.  Either they are not advanced enough to make intergalactic journeys, or they don't believe Terrans are ready for a visitation.|`|ULUpOqplaa	If you were to actually read the texts and documents that are out there then you would realize that we are in fact hybrids of "aliens" and Neanderthals of about 230,000 years ago.  That is why Cro Magnon man suddenly appeared and there are no "transitional" fossils. The gods and nephilim of the bible are in fact the aliens who watched over us and at one point almost allowed us to be destroyed in the deluge that was 13,000 BCE.|`|1lRlNIelaa	First, science has not said for sure whether or not they exist. They say however, that the possibility of alien life (not UFOs duh) is more possible than the lack of it due to many factors. She's not necessarily crazy for believing in something like UFOs and such. She has just weird, non-conventional beliefs. I suggest you ask her more things and see if she really has any theories or if she's just doing it for shock value/attention attraction. And if she seriously does why would she be crazy? Does she have a confirmed mental illness? Why should one who has different beliefs be crazy? Stupid? Maybe. Misguided/misinformed? Even more possible. But crazy? I doubt it.|`|AA11156135	No, - she's not crazy.<br>  <br>  By definition,- if God did not originate from the terestrial earth, -then God is 'alien' to this present and decaying world.<br>  <br>  On another note, - for those that ponder how all the life forms appeared periodically here on this earth, - it IS a possibility that aliens visited, - and dumped their bio-trash here.<br>  <br>  I believe objects are "un-identified", - hence I believe in UNIDENTIFIED flying objects (UFO's)|`|8McPf59Xaa	Yep there Ufo's out there, proof is that long ago in 1942 in Los Angeles like in any other place where there citings the air force and armed soldiers were shooting at it.They call it Battle Los Angeles like the upcoming movie Battle:Los Angeles that I am trying out for!|`|wSYYfBK4aa	God is an alien.

Artificial insemination with an alien-human hybrid offspring is a common theme in UFO lore. Why do you think the three wise men followed a UFO to the birthplace of the hybrid baby Jesus?<br>  <br>  The entire Bible makes perfect sense if you believe we were visited by extraterrestrial beings who tampered with our genetics and interfered with our cultural development.|`|V2Rl90PEaa	Belief in God,Fairies,leprechauns and other such bunk is just as nutty as the "Aliens put us here" theory.

bTA5ndeMaa	eh - we ain't got any immortality.  I sure hope we have some of that there rationality stuff.|`|AA10554783	The foremost principle of learning in theistic psychology is that all thoughts are created by our loves. Therefore, in order to learn or acquire a new habit-skill, we must use our cognitive processes for thinking about what we are to do and how to do it. This cognitive process is an operation in the cognitive mind, which is a spiritual organ involving nerve fibers constructed from the substances streaming out from the Spiritual Sun. However, not a single cognitive operation is possible except through an impulse from the affective organ. You cannot think a single thought unless it is initiated by some love, purpose, or motive in the affective organ called "the will." All thoughts and their operations are goal-directed by an affection for the goal. The affection for the goal is called the motive. The motive is the essential cause or source of all action, behavior, or habit.|`|6dL7UGvfaa	They are independent of each other. If at all, the latter -  especially the modern( after Renaissance) concept of rationality -  may hinder the access of immortality in us.|`|LjsRfaskaa	It depends on ones level of enlightenment.

Lots of attention over ourselves′ behaviour and reactions, deep and slow breath when you notice it coming, and meditation, to improve that attention in daily life.|`|Ho4s4S9aaa	James 1:19-27 Says <br>  1:19 So, then, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger; <br>  1:20 for the anger of man doesn't produce the righteousness of God.<br>  1:21 Therefore, putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with humility the implanted word, which is able to save your souls{or, preserve your life.}. <br>  1:22 But be doers of the word, and not only hearers, deluding your own selves.   <br>  1:23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, <br>  he is like a man beholding his natural face in a mirror; <br>  1:24 for he sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was.<br>  1:25 But he who looks into the perfect law, the law of freedom, and continues, not being a hearer who forgets but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does.<br>  1:26 If anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he doesn't bridle his tongue, <br>  but deceives his heart, this man's religion is worthless. <br>  1:27 Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.<br>  <br>  <br>  ***Becoming angry effects your relationship with God. In all things we do we must be Christ-like. Being quick to anger and reacting prevents us from becoming closer to God. It can be controlled by prayer and help from the Lord.|`|QCejFqXgaa	Blessings , You probably noticed that God's Word doesn't say we will never be angry. Nor does it say that all anger is sin. However, it does set limits for us. We're told, "In your anger do not sin: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold" (Eph. 4:26-27).<br>  <br>  Anger can be a constructive tool, able to build bridges, not walls, if it's managed properly. For example, if we commit ourselves to dealing with our anger before we go to bed, it won't grow during the night into resentment and bitterness. Dealing with anger before bedtime is not always an easy thing to do because at times there's no way of confronting the other person on the day of the incident. In that case, we have to take the circumstances to the Lord and promise Him we will work out the details as soon as possible. Otherwise, we are warned that unresolved anger gives the devil a foothold in our lives.<br>  <br>  Anger is a wedge the devil drives into our spirits. If it's unresolved, it can lead to discouragement, depression, hatred, and even murder. It can cause friction and divisiveness in a family, a church, or in the workplace. That's why Scripture advises us, "Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption" (Eph. 4:29-32).<br>  <br>  When we speak unkindly or negatively, we grieve the Holy Spirit who lives within us. Why does He grieve? Because even though He is willing to give us the power to react differently, we choose to ignore Him. He is there to radiate Christ through our bodies, and we persist in snuffing out that light with our sins. Although these behaviors are the products of our sinful natures, we no longer have to be under their control.<br>  <br>  In the New Testament, particularly in Galatians 5:16-26, we learn that there are two sources of power for our lives: The sinful nature and the Holy Spirit. The sinful nature was crucified with Christ. Its control over us was broken. Now we have Christ Himself living His life in us.<br>  <br>  When we follow the Holy Spirit's guidance, yield our emotions to His control, and are attentive to His gentle nudges, He will produce in us the character of Jesus Christ: "love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control" (Gal. 5:22). If these qualities are deeply ingrained in our character, they will surely change the way we respond to irritation and provocation... So we controlled our anger by praying,  calmning down our behaviar and not letting anger controlling us.|`|AA10471679	I prefer Edward Kurath's assertion that anger is like a burglar alarm.  When it goes off, it's loud, annoying, and you wish you could turn the d***d thing off.<br>  <br>  Disabling it is not the answer; it was put there for a reason.

Yet they taught that I had to write a check so God would bless me; I had to watch every word I spoke so I wouldn't bring a curse upon myself or lose a blessing; I had to live "sinless" so that God would hear my prayers....etc.  Everything I was taught to do was simply a work to get my needs met.  My healing; my finances; my marriage; my job - every facet of my life supposedly depended upon some work I did - a work designed to make God do something for me.<br>  <br>  What hogwash!<br>  <br>  When I finally stopped listening to those messages and got in His Word for myself, I learned who He is - what He has accomplished for me through Jesus Christ - and what the power of His crucifixion and resurrection did for me.  In other words, it was all about Him.  Not me.<br>  <br>  It was His nature; His work; His perfection and not my own that gave me the faith to put everything on the line to trust in Him.  When I was faced with the worst battle of my life - potentially a life and death situation -  I literally did nothing but trust in Him.  I knew there were no options but Him, and I knew that no other options were needed because of what He had already given.  Instead of relying upon my own wits or the so called wisdom of other men, I put myself life or death into His hands.....and He upheld me, healed me, and brought me out on this side shouting the victory!<br>  <br>  When we realize how puny and helpless we truly are, then we'll take our hands off a situation and allow God's Spirit to move on our behalf.  He is glorified where His work is done.<br>  <br>  Or we can glorify ourselves by trying to do what only He can do.  <br>  <br>  Therefore, like Paul I am well content with my own powerlessness, so that my life is solely in the hands of the Most Powerful who created everything good, and who measures the entire universe with the span of his fingers. If that isn't being weak in the strongest circumstances possible, then nothing is.|`|ctOge9SLaa	Hello sister.<br>  Sufferings and trials are often ordained by the Lord for us that we may experience Christ as Grace and Power.  For the sufficiency of the Lord's grace to be magnified, our sufferings are required, for the perfecting of the Lord's power to be shown forth, our weakness is needed. Our brother Paul most gladly boasted in his weakness that the power of Christ might tabernacle or dwell over him. Grace is the supply, and power is the strength, the ability, of grace.<br>  <br>  The power of the Lord Jesus dwelled and tabernacled with Paul, he was weak in his old being, but powerful in the Overshadowing Christ.<br>  <br>  I truly love this portion because the Lord is trying to show is that its not all about our own abilities to do things.  Sometimes we try to substitute our own capabilities and natural strengths for what Christ wants to supply us with.  But sis, everything in our being has to be passed through the cross and come out in resurrection. All our strengths and weaknesses. <br>  <br>  The Lord strongly desires that we come to an end, even humble and submit ourselves to Him. If we are too strong in our natural man, then the Lord cannot be strong for us and even be our grace and power. We need to decrease so that He can increase.<br>  <br>  The thing about our own abilities and strengths is that the end result is not something that God can use. Rather, it will be just our human effort and will burn at the judgment seat of Christ when tried by fire.  Only what is done by Christ operating as grace and power in us will produce Gold, Silver and Precious stones which will stand the trying by fire at this judgment seat.<br>  <br>  1 Cor 3: 12-13<br>  But if anyone builds upon the foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood , grass, stubble.<br>  The work of each will become manifest, for the day will declare it, because it is revealed by fire, and the fire itself will prove each one's work, of what sort it is.<br>  <br>  Thank you for these awesome verses and post.<br>  Your sister<br>  sandy|`|JCGEbyrKaa	it simply means that we shdnot be sad becoz of our weaknesses but we shd be glad becoz God is ready to work his power in our weaknesses and turn them into our our own good....|`|UWlRLXvRaa	I know what it means in the physical sense to be weak and therefore dependent upon God for His strength to make it through the day. But I'm also learning what it means to be dependent upon God's grace and boast in my non physical weaknesses so that His power may rest on me. <br>  <br>  Someone once said, "It is not the great men who change the world rather it's the weak ones in the hands of a Great God." And that is what I believe Paul is referring to here. <br>  <br>   The whole "thorn in my flesh" thing doesn't refer to Paul's eye problems but rather the people that were following behind him and teaching his "flock" that to be saved one had to convert to certain Jewish laws and regulations, primarily that they had to be circumcised. God would never put a physical illness on someone just to keep them quiet. It goes against the message of the gospel!<br>  <br>  Paul was a very high task person so it was very frustrating to him to have people come behind him and mess with what he was building in the kingdom. He wanted God to remove them but God said no and because of that we have the gospel of Jesus Christ and grace in written form. Paul had experienced some great things in heaven that he wasn't allowed to share and to guard against those revelations God allowed these Jews to come along. It kept Paul focused preaching the true gospel and it also kept him dependent upon the grace of God to fulfill his calling. He realized that in himself, in his flesh, he didn't have the strength to deal with those "hosers" and he hated always having to "rebuild" what he had laid but God's grace was suffiencent.   <br>  <br>  This band of Jews were wearing Paul down. And when he said a "thorn in his flesh" he was referring to the idea that Moses and Joshua used when warning the Israelites about what would happen to them if they didn't drive out the nations that were in the promised land. (Num.33:55; Josh. 22:13). He was referring to this "Judeaizers"<br>  <br>  But Paul had realized that putting confidence in his own accomplishments and natural abilities and strength got him (or the kingdom) nowhere. He realized that to rest in his own strength wouldn't be grace. To fully receive God's grace means we must give up confidence in our own abilities. The best we have to offer God won't last. That's why we are called to surrender our best and receive His grace. Only His grace gets the job the done! The work accomplished through the grace of God is the only thing that will last. (1 Cor.3:10-15)<br>  <br>  All those self help books found in Christian bookstores and other places are actually the enemies of effective Christian ministry. They call people to put their confidence in themselves and methods instead of believing in God and trusting His power to get the job done. We are not to use the Bible to make ourselves better and more effective. That's not what the Bible teaches. We are called to surrender our best and live by faith in the grace of God, trusting Him to work through us and make us into the people He's called us to be. <br>  <br>  What it means to me is that it's not only o.k. to boast about my natural weaknesses, it's a good thing to boast about my weaknesses so that God's grace will come through. (If the nonbelievers could hear this now, they really think we're nuts! Who in their "right" mind boasts about their weaknesses? We do!)|`|Zgs4RncIaa	To me it means I can take all insults about my faith thrown at me for I live and walk with God and nothing else matters.

I will be stronger in the outcome.|`|AA11008046	Paul in his second letter to the church at Corinth is talking about his "thorn in the flesh" that was given him, to buffet him, lest he be exalted above measure.  He had asked the Lord 3 times to remove this thorn but Jesus told Paul "..My grace is sufficient for thee...etc."<br>  Paul is telling us to be glad for our infirmities and use them to exalt Christ rather than murmur.  It says to me that to boast about your works may be necessary, it is not profitable so let exalt your works even in distress, etc for Christ's sake.  When he is weak through Christ he is strong and thus, no real need to complain even in persecutions.  It is a great teaching on humility.  When I read this passage I immediately thought of the Scripture "..through Christ all things are possible.."<br>  I really like what Paul wrote a bit later in he letter about not being carnal v.20 and he lists backbitings, jealous, selfish ambitions, etc as things that bring about carnality or as Paul may say a "thorn in his flesh"|`|AA10554783	This person: the indirect way of referring to himself has the effect of emphasizing the distance between that experience and his everyday life, just as the indirect someone in Christ (2 Cor 12:2) and all the passive verbs emphasize his passivity and receptivity in the experience.

Therefore, that I might not be overly exalted, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, an angel of Satan, to keep striking me, that I might not be overly exalted. In this behalf I three times entreated the Lord that it might depart from me; and yet he really said to me: ‘My undeserved kindness is sufficient for you; for my power is being made perfect in weakness.’ Most gladly, therefore, will I rather boast as respects my weaknesses, that the power of the Christ may like a tent remain over me. Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in cases of need, in persecutions and difficulties, for Christ. For when I am weak, then I am powerful.”—2?Cor. 12:6-10, NW.<br>  <br>   What was Paul’s thorn in the flesh? Some think it may have been poor eyesight or a ***** affliction of the eye. This may have been a hang-over from the three days of blindness with which Jesus struck him down when, as Saul of Tarsus, he was on his way to Damascus to extend his violent persecution to Christians there. To stop Saul abruptly and to convince him instantly that Christ was resurrected to heavenly glory and that it was the followers of the living, glorified Christ whom Saul of Tarsus was persecuting, Jesus miraculously appeared to him in the way to Damascus. But while not being killed by the vision or having his eyes burnt out of their sockets, he had to pay dearly for it. It was only by another miracle that his eyesight was restored. But likely to only a limited degree.—Acts 9:1-19.<br>  <br>   Paul seems to refer to dim eyesight when he writes the Galatians: “I bear you witness that, if it had been possible, you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me.” This, too, may be why he added this line to them: “See with what large letters I have written you with my own hand.” (Gal. 4:15; 6:11, NW) For that reason, too, it may be that he dictated most of his letters. Poor eyesight seems to be betrayed when in the Jewish court he looked intently at the Sanhedrin and spoke back sharply to the high priest and then apologized, saying: “Brothers, I did not know he was high priest. For it is written, ‘You must not speak injuriously of a ruler of your people.’” (Acts 23:1-5, NW) At any rate, a *****, weak pair of eyes in those days without spectacles could have been quite a handicap and hindrance to Paul at work and study. It could have irked him, making him long for its correction, and making him pray about it. An American Translation renders “thorn in the flesh” loosely as “a bitter physical affliction”.<br>  <br>   But Paul’s “thorn in the flesh” may correspond with something that plagued the Israelites after they had entered the land of milk and honey. On the plains of Moab, across the Jordan river from the Promised Land, Moses said this warning to them: “But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then shall those that ye let remain of them be as pricks in your eyes, and as thorns in your sides, and they shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.” And Moses’ successor, Joshua, repeated this warning before he died. (Num. 33:55; Josh. 23:11-13, AS) The Israelites failed to heed these warnings and did not push the campaign of ridding the land of the pagan, demon-worshiping peoples, and so Jehovah sent his angel and said to them: “Ye have not hearkened unto my voice: why have ye done this? Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.” (Judg. 2:2, 3, AS) So the apostle Paul may have had some such thorn in the flesh like those pagan, demon worshipers of Canaan who plagued with their presence those Israelites who were trying to go straight according to Jehovah’s law.

gpQm5ZPpaa	Southern is what I hear.  But I don't know, I haven't really been to many other areas...|`|KSq8DXlfaa	I think that Jason sort of has a point, though he said it in a stupid way. If I understand correctly, he means that the entire state isn't prejudiced and you have to look at it as individual people; there are individuals in every state who are homophobic and individuals in every state who aren't, and it could be argued that by generalizing you're being bigoted yourself (though I disagree!) <br>       I think many southern states have more bigots than others because rural areas tend to be more centered around religion, the South is more rural in general, and religion is a factor that contributes to homophobia. So I would expect rural areas in the southwest like Texas, Louisiana, etc. to have more bigots. I also have some crazy b@stard relatives living in Baltimore who are homophobic. Unfortunately, though, there are ignorant pieces of sh!t everywhere and some hate crimes are carried out in the northeast as well. "Your people" are bashed by humanity more than religion; it is individuals who choose to listen to the parts of the Bible that say homosexuals should be stoned to death, rather than to "Love thy neighbor". I don't deny that religion factors in to it, though.<br>       My shortish answer to your question is, states in the southwest tend to be populated by more homophobic individuals than states in the northeast because there are more rural areas. That means that people come in contact with fewer people who don't fit the same labels(for lack of a better word) as those already in their community, and because conservative religion holds up better there. So yeah, states in the southwest would have slightly more homophobes than those in the north:(|`|NwXnzARwaa	Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, & Ohio.|`|qPkrNA7gaa	basically most southern and republican-heavy states. they'll be all up in the religion thing and be all crazy and say "homos go to hell" and crap like that.that's just sickening...

Really, THAT is prejudice.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Anyway, I have traveled all over this great nation of ours, and have never experienced any prejudice against gays. Sure, there is the occasional religious nut, but seriously - consider the source.
NXTpQSdhaa	I am agnostic. And very secure in my beliefs. Generally this does not cause conflict because I wont tell anyone else they are "wrong" in their beliefs. How could I know?<br>  <br>  Two of my ex girlfriends were devout Christians (although they have since given this up). One was Sikh. Four others were atheist/agnostic as far as I know. <br>  <br>  My wife is agnostic. Initially she said she was Christian when I asked her about her beliefs. When I asked her what she believed she said that maybe God exists but she didn't see how anyone could prove it. I asked her if she believed in the Bible and Jesus and she said no way. I then had to point out she probably wasn't a Christian.<br>  <br>  Many people equate a general deist belief with whatever the most common religion is in their country as this gives them a sense of national identity. They will then put this on survey data and as a result some countries will have inflated figures of certain religions when really "deist" or "theist" or even "agnostic" is probably much more common.<br>  <br>  None of the above relationships suffered due a difference in belief.|`|51f7d0ee07bcbaea13dc55784aea7f62aa	All of my exes believed in an invisible friend.

However, it isn't conclusive evidence.  So if you're in a debate about the bible don't use this as sure-fire evidence but it's sound.  Why is it sound?  Well lets look at what the fanatics aren't addressing:<br>  <br>  Beauty is a subjective concept.  When fundamentalists claim that god made new Jerusalem beautiful by using gold/jewels it's a valid case but it does not dismiss your angle on the issue.  Is it coincidence that gold/jewels are extremely valued by many mortals?  Perhaps.  We're left with two options:<br>  <br>  a) god thinks those things are beautiful too<br>  b) man made the book for other people<br>  <br>  Neither is conclusive, and both depend on perspective, but philosophically it leans towards you.

He will subdue three kings [Daniel 7:8, 24]<br>  <br>  3. He is different from the other kings [Daniel 7:24]<br>  <br>  4. He will rise from obscurity…a “little horn” [Daniel 7:8]<br>  <br>  5. He will speak boastfully [Daniel 7:8; Rev 13:5]<br>  <br>  6. He will blaspheme God, [Daniel 7:25; 11:36; Rev 13:5] slandering His Name, dwelling place, and departed Christians and Old Testament saints [Rev 13:6]<br>  <br>  7. He will oppress the saints and be successful for 3 ? years [Daniel 7:25; Rev 13:7]<br>  <br>  <br>  8. He will try to change the calendar, perhaps to define a new era, related to himself [Daniel 7:25]<br>  <br>  9. He will try to change the laws, perhaps to gain an advantage for his new kingdom and era<br>  [Dan 7:25]<br>  <br>  10. He will not be succeeded by another earthly ruler, but by Christ [Daniel 7:26-27]<br>  <br>  11. He will confirm a covenant with “many”, i.e. the Jewish people [Daniel 9:27]<br>  This covenant will likely involve the establishment of a Jewish Temple in Jerusalem <br>  [see Dan 9:27; Matt 24:15]<br>  <br>  12. He will put an end to Jewish sacrifice and offerings after 3 ? years and will set up an abomination to God in the Temple [Daniel 9:27, Matthew 24:15]<br>  <br>  13. He will not answer to a higher earthly authority; “He will do as he pleases”[Daniel 11:36]<br>  <br>  14. He will show no regard for the religion of his ancestors [Daniel 11:37]<br>  <br>  15. He will not believe in any god at all [except for himself] [Daniel 11:37]<br>  <br>  16. He will have "no regard for the desire of women": He will either be asexual or homosexual <br>  [Dan 11:37]<br>  <br>  17. He will claim to be greater than any god [Daniel 11:37; 2 Thess 2:4]<br>  <br>  18. He will claim to be God [2 Thessalonians 2:4]<br>  <br>  19. He will only honor a “god” of the military. His whole focus and attention will be on his military. He will conquer lands and distribute them [Daniel 11:39-44]<br>  <br>  20. His arrival on the world scene will be accompanied by miracles, signs and wonders [2 Thess 2:9]<br>  <br>  21. Either he, or his companion [The False Prophet], will claim to be Christ [Matt 24:21-28]<br>  <br>  22. He will claim that Jesus did not come in the flesh, or that Jesus did not rise bodily from the grave<br>  [2 John 7]. He will deny that Jesus is the Messiah [I John 2:22]<br>  <br>  23. He will be worshipped by many people [Rev. 13:8]<br>  <br>  24. He will hate a nation that initially will have some control over his kingdom, but he will destroy this nation [Rev 17:16-18]<br>  <br>  25.

DvGJ50zQaa	Christianity was a collection of various beliefs that was later liberalized by the Romans. It was done to create unity in a culturally different empire. The introduction of one state sponsored religion, was meant to unify the people, which it did until Martin Luther came along, and the Germans had had enough of the Roman Church's favoritism.<br>  <br>  Not really that familiar with Islam, but am certain that Mohammad had similar ideas. You have to understand that the formation of religion, is typically done over hundreds of years, and is a culmination of belief in thousands of people, indoctrinated in their kids. Its not something that just happens one day.<br>  <br>  That leads people like yourself to assume that it has supernatural beginnings, because it 'feels' like truth in your heart.<br>  <br>  I would argue that Arab Society was influenced by trade, much more positively than by Islam.|`|LjsRfaskaa	I don't know anything much about the history of Islam. But Christianity is the creation of the last emperor of Rome, Constantine. He commissioned it after the plague hit Constantinople which killed 50% of the population. He was one of the rare survivors who caught it and recovered, unfortunately it left him completely insane. He was a despot before the plague and an insane despot after it.<br>  <br>  He used a small cult that had become popular and turned it into a weapon of mass destruction. His objective before the plague was to reunite the two halves of the Empire and after wards this did not change. Except now he is mad. He ordered the libraries of Alexandria to be burnt, setting mankind back millenia. He made a pact with the viscous Visigoths to sake Europe in return for regaining Roman control of it.<br>  <br>  The Visigoths basically walked it because there were no intact armies left in Europe after the plague, it was perfect timing. They murdered anyone left alive who disagreed.<br>  <br>  When Christianity hit the norther Celts, they would not convert. The Christians destroyed all their sacred circles, planted ugly buildings on the sites to stop them being used and plagiarized all their festivals, dates and all. All the Christians did was substitute Jesus instead of the Sun as the messiah, ie as per the Celtic Cross.<br>  <br>  25th dec, Christmas, is the birth of the new sun. After dying by dropping below the horizon in the winter, by 25th dec the sun is clearly above the horizon again.<br>  <br>  Easter, the spring equinox. The sun is in the middle of the Cross constellation, as depicted by the Celtic Cross and represents the resurrection of life after its death in the winter.<br>  <br>  When the Celts still refused to become Christians, they tortured, raped, stole their property, and burnt hundreds of thousands of people alive. Including my g.g.g.g.grandmother who was a healer. A sweet little old lady helping the sick was such an abomination she needed to be burnt alive in front of her family, little kids and all. No one was spared. <br>  <br>  That is how Christianity became the biggest religion, by warfare and murder and acts of atrocities against humanity.<br>  <br>  Practicing Shaman... quantum physics rocks.|`|ewWUFWyWaa	It has been my experience here in YA R&S that any comment that I make about Islam gets deleted and I get a VN... So good luck to you...|`|o4UrRbTvaa	For the same reason all religions come about.  A religion always happens in a time when people are oppressed & depressed and they either need something to explain what is happening to them or to give them "hope" for the future.  Look how a "holy man" always seems to "show up" when people are oppressed and then tells them exactly what they want to hear.  The next thing you know, a new religion is formed.  Religion also came about for control and to justify ones actions.|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	People have made up thousands of religions, for various reasons:   fear of death, power, to explain things they can't, money, etc.  <br>  <br>  I don't know what the exact original motive was because there are so many to pick from and it's usually a combination.  But humans sure do like to make them up for whatever reason.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	Fear, a desire to learn in an age where ignorance ruled, and a need for a way to control the thoughts and will of other people, thereby getting other people to do your dirty work for you and to have a excuse to kill all those who would dare disagree with you.|`|XxWovDNCaa	Religion is always about the control of people with lower education and poor IQ.

Judaism took some traditions from previous religions as well.<br>  <br>  Then it goes back to pre-written history, to shamanism, animism and so on.<br>  Ultimately, it's all boils down to a shaman pretending to have control over supernatural powers and being given food and valuables for it.<br>  <br>  The hunt went well?

To start with, these men who were seeing things either awake or asleep, were more then likely on some type of drugs or drinking wine and witnessed some natural element of the world and came up with a story to explain it, much like the ancient Greeks with their myths.  Which by the way, there are alot of pagan elements in the bible which leads me to believe that they borrowed from the pagans. <br>  <br>  From there, they all got together and created a book to put these stories in so they could compare.  They also threw in moral guidelines to help control the people. Then they started to spread their new-found beliefs.  As they spread, people began to act better because these men told of this hell.<br>  <br>  Later, people used religions as a way to control the general populous so that they could get power and riches.  Even today, people use hell and brimstone to get money (those tv evangelist) and power (the government and even President Obama).  <br>  <br>  So in conclusion to help create a better society and then to control that society.<br>  <br>  I'm not overly educated with Islam so I can't really give a viable opinion on this religion, so I'm unable to give alot of imput there.|`|yYYXVCGZaa	the origins of ancient religions are lost to antiquity.  but suffice it to say, religion was primitive mans way of explaining the mysterious and violent world around him.  it then evolved into a methodology for controlling populations and the leaders of those cultures learned to invoke their "special" relationship to whatever deity was worshiped by that culture.  in the case of christianity,  it was really saul of tarsus who seized upon this formula to create the catholic church.  in islam, it was mohammed who moved his people to become muslims and follow him.  you can see how this can happen just by examining the current presidents rise to power.  obama is a perfect case study of just how human beings are manipulated and controlled by a charismatic individual.  now, as to your assertion that arab societies were "barbaric" until mohammed came along, you need to find a correct history book.  arabs were quite accomplished and forward thinking especially in the areas of mathematics and astronomy until this man quite literally, bludgeoned them back to the stone age.  and as you can see, they are still there...|`|zQyslfHKaa	Christianity was a collection of various beliefs that was later literalized by the Romans.

Maybe little kids don't mind being hit with a little water sometimes, but it is unacceptable to do it to adults.<br>  If I were you, I would continue avoiding him. I would tell him again that I do not enjoy his conversations and being sprayed with water.|`|6W7nJYskaa	He sounds awful, I feel really sorry for you having to put up with him. <br>  <br>  I would think that the best way to handle it would be to ignore him completely when he tries to talk to you. Either that or be more firm when you tell him that you don't want to discuss private matters. <br>  <br>  Or you could come straight out with 'it's none of your business' when he asks again, that usually shuts people up. :-)|`|BvHRriEyaa	You have no reason to avoid him, you haven't done anything wrong. Tell him straight how you feel, things like that are really none of his business :/|`|0SoDvjU7aa	personally i think he's bang out of order on all accounts mentioned,<br>  so yeah i think your'e normal.......|`|AA11066099	Hi, just tell him how you feel.I would.x|`|82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	He's over the line. You should talk to him again next time he brings it up. State simply, "I don't feel that's any of your business and I'd appreciate you not bringing it up again."<br>  <br>  [EDIT]<br>  glowgirl, not EVERY woman in the world feels like they NEED to be in a relationship every second of the day. Some people can actually be happy being single. It's called "proving their independence" and it's an awesome thing. I feel sorry for any girl who thinks she NEEDS to be in a relationship to be happy or complete. What a sad, pathetic existence.|`|DWFMM23Caa	he sounds like a smuck. he obviously is oblivious that he is really pee-ing you off.  i would tell him out straight to stop asking such personal Q's or make up an elaborate answer to throw him off completely, as for the hose, run to him while he has the hose in his hand and grab it off him and soak him.  other than that, take "answerme"'s advice, he/she is aware of chinese culture, whereas i wouldn't know much about it.|`|c2YcBbXyaa	he sounds like a real jerk.....you're going to have to be rude to him i guess...there's a guy like that in the building where i work..it took me a long time but i finally got him to leave me a lone by ignoring him and when he would talk to me i'd just answer him with yes or no answers and sometimes not at all|`|yGFG3fxDaa	Yes, it's normal for you to ignore him.  But you didn't have to mention the color of his skin in your question - are you implying that all Asian men are like that?  No.  His color didn't matter in this context.  His mannerisms did.|`|0cbbecbdc82615f79e12b103dd58a90caa	tell him you don't want to talk to him anymore and to leave you alone and then don't engage.|`|2BQLR8hlaa	I think he is stepping way over the mark here. I used to feel uncomfortable with similar remarks when I was single in my early 30's. You told him you were not happy previously and for someone else to comment on here that you must be insecure is not constructive. If you speak to him again and it contnues then call the police as his behavior is actually illegal and is harrassment if not sexual harrassment.|`|KDNWFuZWaa	This man is obviously trying to be friendly and nothing more, it would not matter colour or religion.<br>  You could have a quiet word with him just saying that you do not find it comfortable him asking personal questions and you would rather he did not do this in future if he wishes to talk to you. Also ask him nicely not to go quite as far as soaking you next time explain how it bothered you and your mother.<br>  If it does not work by talking to him tell his wife of the over familiar behaviour she might have a good way of wording it to him to stop this in future.|`|X4UAMHhRaa	did anyone else notice how answerme enumerated all the instances he's been mistreated by/witnessed ill-behavior of Chinese people? (the business, the chinese teacher) as if saying, "all Chinese people are like that," also as if saying that these behaviors can never be seen in other cultures.<br>  <br>  I think that everyone including Americans will find it strange that someone as old as 37 is still single. I just dont know whether it is considered rude to ask in other cultures. I am of asian descent (not chinese dont worry answerme) and I know it is rude to ask someone's age (if they're obviously old) and the reason why they're still single. <br>  <br>  Next time he tries to talk to you, just give him one-liner yes/no/i dont know or just shrug your shoulder, I'm sure this will give him the idea. You don't need to elaborate because the point is you dont wanna talk to him. I dont know about getting water sprayed by him, thats really unacceptable in my opinion and I've never heard of this water spraying thing being common with Asian culture. Just ask him "Are you retarded?"|`|Z9T93ETJaa	Is there a question somewhere in this?  I don't see it, but assume you want to know what to do?  Ignore him.  Tell him off if he squirts you and mama with the hose anymore.  Don't speak to him at the bus stop.  What else could you do?  Sure a lot of drama going on for a neighbor four doors down.  I'd cross the street instead of walking in front of his house.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	The guy is an asshole and deliberately spraying you with water is considered assault and if he does that again you need to report him to the police; as to asking personal questions just say NOTHING if he does that again, it's none of his damn business.|`|AA11286455	You know how you feel.  <br>  <br>  OFFENDED.  <br>  <br>  And you have every right and every good reason to feel that way.  <br>  <br>  So go ahead and repeat, but more forcefully and loudly, what you've previously said:  I'm not interested in discussing....!  I don't want to talk to you ANYmore.  <br>  <br>  Next time he starts, cut all such conversation off the minute it's clear he's headed that way.  Then turn away, bury yourself in a book, talk to another bystander, totally ignore him....you have to cut him off at the knees.  <br>  <br>  If he continues to talk to you, act like he does not exist and you don't hear him.  Treat him like the social clod he is and let him stand there, seemingly talking to himself; he'll get a clue soon enough how stupid he looks.  <br>  <br>  Develop nerves of steel if you have to, but don't ignore him one week and then chat with him the next.  Like a simple minded child, he needs consistency.  <br>  <br>  Also, by doing this, it addresses the fact that he has very little to no sense of shame or social limits.  Do go ahead and create some for him by ignoring him.  And definitely do it when other people are around.  This will "remind" him that it's risky to invade your privacy and he looks rather foolish.  Hopefully he will then get himself under better control.  <br>  <br>  For the Asian culture, to be unmarried at your age, (esp. being female) is a big deal.  So in some respects, your social situation is a real conundrum for him.  You may be a "curiosity" on this basis, something that he just can't fathom--and making him incapable and inflexible in respecting the choices (cultural or social) of others.  <br>  <br>  As an example:  In the Chinese culture, if your family is very traditional, then you are not allowed to leave home to live on your own, whether you're a son OR a daughter.  You can only get out of the house by marrying.  <br>  <br>  Now, the next time he does something like spray you with water, tell him loudly, forcefully to:  STOP IT.  We/I don't like that!  <br>  <br>  Don't be shy or embarrassed by treating him this way and definitely do not try to be "polite" when others are there witnessing/overhearing the exchange.  <br>  <br>  Set a limit for yourself; if he does it more than twice or three times and is still not responding to your insistance that he stop, then inform him:  <br>  <br>  "What you are doing is called ASSAULT.   If you do it again, I'm filing a police report."  <br>  <br>  From my experiences working in S.F.'s Chinatown for years and living close to it, any mention of contacting the police or other official is like an American child being scared of the "boogeyman".  <br>  <br>  In the school where I worked, one of the Chinese teachers apparently couldn't be bothered in working with a difficult and somewhat out of control child by using basic psychology or child development principles.  <br>  <br>  She told him that if he didn't stop his behavior, she was going to call the police.  The kid, who was all of 4 years old, completely freaked and his behavior became even more out of control and more violent.  <br>  <br>  As well, when I'd been mistreated by Chinese businesses, asking for the manager, a supervisor, or taking down any other info. in writing (the name of the business, the name off a name tag, etc.), the person mistreating me freaked.  <br>  <br>  Don't be shy about using such techniques on your neighbor since he has little to no self-control.  At this late stage in the game, as far as I'm concerned, he's run out of chances and deserves no more free passes.  <br>  <br>  You totally have a right to feel comfortable and safe outside your own home and not be assaulted physically, emotionally, or verbally.  <br>  '<br>  Good luck.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	He`s a P***k. If you can`t avoid him, then next time he asks anything personal  - just tell straight to mind his own business - and don`t even say please.|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	i would stay away from creepo, and tell his wife if he doesn't quit bothering you|`|Ct2sQ5Ciaa	I would feel irritated by this man in your shoes, I would also walk to the next bus stop.  The only thing you can do is to completely ignore him.  I would not even acknowledge his existence, then he will either get the message or eventually get bored.  If you see him in the street cross the road and wait for him to go indoors.  I am sure eventually he will stop talking to you.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Some people don't understand why other people make the choices that they do. It is ok for him, he has found a wife and had kids, but not all of us get this opportunity this soon or even choose to at that stage in our lives. Im 30 and not married , I don't feel obliged to do so either. He clearly has old fashioned values and thinks that everyone else should also have them. Don;t hide from him, stand up for yourself! He has no right to judge you about your decisions in life. For all he knows you could be doing a PHD and living at home to save money. It is really none of his business tbh. You could always make fun of him and say you are enjoying your independence instead of being saddled with kids and a husband. haha
OTv6MjJPaa	What do you mean by differences? The only ones I see are within the wording<br>  1. when I got stuck<br>  2. when I was getting stuck<br>  3. I tired to go; I got stuck<br>  4. I tried to go; I was getting stuck<br>  The differences I spotted were just the way the tense of the verb (simple past, past progressive, etc) <br>  If you need a follow up on what tenses are you can follow this link <br>  <br>  <a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/handouts/esl/esltensverb.html" rel="nofollow">http://owl.english.purdue.edu/handouts/e...</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helped you out ^_^|`|lCtl1L3kaa	Number one is best.<br>  I was trying... when I got stuck...<br>  "I was trying" indicates what was happening when you "got stuck".<br>  The "trying to go and visit" was in progress when you got stuck.<br>  You choose "got stuck" because getting stuck only happened once.  It was a single event that happened.  Once the elevator stopped and you were stuck, that's the one event.<br>  <br>  Sentence 2:<br>  When you say "I was getting stuck" in the elevator, it means that you got stuck over and over. Or getting stuck was a continual process.  Even if you were stuck in there for a while, it was just one event, and it happened in the past.  <br>  <br>  Sentence 3:<br>  This is OK, but since you have "when" in the sentence, the first one is better because it indicates that one thing was in progress "when" the other thing happened.  Sentence 3 indicates that the "trying to visit" is done, so "when" doesn't fit.  <br>  <br>  Sentence 3 would work if "when" was changed to "and".<br>  "I tried to go and visit my parents last night and I got stuck in the elevator in their apartment building."<br>  <br>  Sentence 4:<br>  Again, "was getting" indicates a continual event, or an ongoing event.  It's not what you're looking for here.|`|cU1MxE8Paa	This is Past Continuous vs Past Simple.<br>  <br>  It says that you are in the PROCESS/MIDDLE of something, when something else happened.<br>  <br>  Sentences 2 and 3 do not make sense.<br>  Sentence 4 would only be correct if you decided to go and visit your parents ONLY after you got stuck in the elevator.<br>  <br>  Therefore, 1 is the only correct sentence.

The Prophet asked them, "What does the Torah says about pelting stones?" They replied, "We humiliate them and give publicly to their evil act and punish them by flogging." Abdullah bin Salam said, "You are telling a lie. Bring the Torah which also ordains pelting stones." So they brought the Torah and one of them having covered his hand the verse relating to the pelting of stones read out the verse preceding it and the verse after it. <br>  Abdullah bin Salam said, "Take off your hand." And the verse about pelting stones was seen clearly. The Jew said, "Abdullah bin Salam is right. The verse about pelting stones is there." Then the Prophet directed that both the committers of adultery be stoned to death and they met their fate. (traditions collected by Muslim and Bukhari) (In Yusuf Ali's commentary no. 2954 on verse an-Nur 24:2)<br>  <br>  <br>  2)Book 017, Number 4209: <br>  Abu Huraira and Zaid b Khalid al-Juhani reported that one of the desert tribes came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Messenger of Allah, I beg of you in the name of Allah that you pronounce judgment about me according to the Book of Allah. The second claimant who was wiser than him said: Well, decide amongst us according to the Book of Allah, but permit me (to say something). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon ham) said: Say. He said: My son was a servant in the house of this person and he committed adultery with his wife. I was informed that my son deserved stoning to death (as punishment for this offence). I gave one hundred goats and a slave girl as ransom for this. I asked the scholars (if this could serve as an expiation for this offence). They informed me that my son deserved one hundred lathes and exile for one year. and this woman deserved stoning (as she was married). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace he upon him) said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life. I will decide between you according to the Book of Allah. The slave-girl and the goats should be given back, and your son is to be punished with one hundred lashes and exile for one year. And, O Unais (b. Zuhaq al-Aslami), go to this woman in the morning, and if she makes a confession, then stone her. He (the narrator) said: He went to her in the morning and she made a confession. And Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) made pronouncement about her and she was stoned to death.<br>  <br>  <br>  3)Book 017, Number 4206: <br>  'Abdullah b. Buraida reported on the authority of his father that Ma'iz b. Malik al-Aslami came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah's Messenger, I have wronged myself; I have committed adultery and I earnestly desire that you should purify me. He turned him away. On the following day, he (Ma'iz) again came to him and said: Allah's Messenger, I have committed adultery.

TbTO5SXlaa	I believe that any able-bodied person should work for any benefits they receive. <br>  <br>  There are miles and miles of highways that are strewn with litter. Require the welfare leeches to work from 8am to 4:30pm Mon. thru Fri. to pick up the litter. They can also plant flowers and trees in season. If guardrails need painting then that's even more work to keep them busy.<br>  <br>  I believe that people who have more than one child out of wedlock should not receive any additional food stamps or other assistance. If the child's daddy is known then he should either pay child support or go to jail. If he has fathered more than one child out of wedlock then he should receive a free vasectomy - whether he wants one or not. A woman who has more than one child out of wedlock will receive a free tubal ligation - whether she wants one or not.<br>  <br>  If the above sounds harsh, too bad. I believe that society has a right to protect itself from irresponsible behavior. We have laws against driving while impaired and/or driving while distracted. We have laws to force food producers to work to certain standards. Some states even have laws that require that an unattended cigarette extinguish itself. <br>  <br>  I can hear the howls of the ACLU and other groups now. Have you ever noticed how all these groups that babble incessantly about "rights" "rights" "rights" never utter one word about responsibility? As I told a kid who drives a car with a stereo system that rattles windows for blocks around: "Yes, you have a right to listen to your music as loud as you want. However, I have an equally valid right to not have to hear it. And you have a responsibility to make sure you aren't violating my rights."|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	Internet and cable? No.  Cell phone? Yes, but only if they don't have a home phone.  It's important that parents have a way of contact just in case something happens with their children, regardless of whether or not they're receiving assistance.  But that cell phone should be the most basic model on the least expensive plan.  You shouldn't be carrying around the latest Blackberry if you need government help to afford food for your family.|`|A6PS0jRfaa	no,if You can afford internet,cable and a cell you can  get rid of those things and have enough money to buy food.It would depend on the cell phone,if they didn't have a home phone and the cell was prepaid or some cheap plan then I can see but cable and internet are luxuries.Too often I've seen people get food stamps who have PlayStation's,wii's,cable big screen tv's...while people who really need it like a senior citizen who struggles to live on a social security check  are told they don't qualify for food stamps.|`|D9x1QSgiaa	What's the difference between cell phones and home phone? You can also use the internet to SEARCH FOR JOBS....so why should owning a computer be a "disqualifier"??? Having Cable TV doesn't have anything to do with being unemployed.....unless you think people on Food Stamps can't hold a job because they watch too much TV??? You wanna take their AM/FM radio too? Maybe I shouldn't be allowed to drive a car that is newer than 8 years old???? Maybe you also think that they shouldn't be able to own jewelry, nice clothing or other things??? I'm not on Food Stamps (E.B.T. in Minnesota) but it's not any of MY business what they own or don't own.<br>  If we are EVERRRR going to get families OFF of Welfare Assistance (T.A.N.F.) we need to encourage them to continue with their education, stop discrimination against ex-offenders, FREE treatment for drug and alcohol abuse and start giving them the help they can really use.|`|de641317a0696a8d53df9d1538305a2baa	I agree.  However, this is America, and part of being free is being free to make dumb choices with money.  It's sad, though, esp. when children are involved.  It shows children that it's okay to live like a sponge and depend on the government to finance their life.  Oh and wait a minute, isn't my bank and car company doing that, too?

We decorate cakes for celebrations, mostly birthdays. These special-order cakes can cost $50-100, and a great percentage of them are bought with....you guessed it....Food Stamps. Perfectly legal. <br>  <br>  And many more than one time, I've seen these cakes, half or three-fourths gone, returned. The cake was "too dry". Or the frosting was "too sweet". No joke. Sadly, these indignant customers are given a (cash) refund. <br>  <br>  And Food Stamps are allowed for Deli purchases of sliced-to-order meats and cheeses. Shrimp platters. 100-piece fried chicken orders. Party platters. <br>  <br>  And the clincher? These customers can barely yank themselves from their top-of -the-line cell phones to order these items.<br>  <br>  To (finally) directly answer your question: No, no, and no.|`|xvey8ixPaa	I agree. but, the thing is, if someone else is paying for it....like a friend or relative for the kids there is not much the government can say. I did collect food stamps for a short period when y daughter was young and i was not working full time. I had a car. i went to work, to school, to church. My own mother made me carry a cell phone. (I was in my 30's) When I moved out on my own with just my daughter and me, I worked full time, had no cable. I did not get any assistance like food stamps, just qualified for moderate income rent control. My mother still paid for my cell and then put in a computer and internet for my daughter to use becuase of school pressures as she was in Jr. High adn we were at the public library every day waiting for computer use. I never signed up for it becuase I could not afford it at all. So, I agree whole heartedly that if you are recieving any public assistance you should not be able to afford these services, but the thing is someone else could be paying for them "for the kids" and you can not control that.|`|Wu9SjRCXaa	Cell - maybe (because I have one and it's usually cheaper than a home phone).

nnwbxPKfaa	Yes it is time for gun control. Most of these card carrying members of the NRA don't get it. Where do they think criminals get their guns? They steal them from legal gun owners. Take an illegal gun away from somebody and they'll just turn around and break into some NRA member's house or a gun shop and steal another one or buy it off someone who did. <br>  <br>  Outlawing guns would be the first step to getting guns out of the hands of criminals. Not to mention that every time some kid decides to kill his family or shoot all his classmates they do it with a legal gun. Look at that 11 year old boy in PA who shot his dad's pregnant fiancee to death last week. He did it with a junior sized shotgun his dad bought him for Christmas and because it was junior sized, they didn't even need to license or register it. That is outrageous.|`|PvPPivLJaa	The guns were probably not registered and illegally obtained, so not sure how gun control could help.

I own guns, and I will keep my guns. I think the best crime deterrent would be for everyone to have a gun. In states like Arizona, where a lot of people carry a firearm with them at all times, guess what? No carjackings in AZ. In New York City, where you can't so much as carry a can of mace? Lots of crime. The statistics prove that. If you take guns away from law abiding citizens, the only people that will have guns are criminals. What do you think that would do to the odds? If someone tries to break into my house or hurt me or my family, I will shoot them. That's it. No questions asked. I will not put my child's life at risk because some bleeding heart liberal is so concerned about the rights of the bad guys.|`|pDv13gJwaa	Gun Control as in take guns away from legal owners..

Hewett points out: "one can always...say of god he is characterized by light; one cannot always say of light that is is god."<br>  similar examples are found at John 4:24 "gos is a spirit." and at John 4:16 "god is love.". in bothof these verses, the subjects have definate articles but the predicates "spirit" and "love" so not. so the subjects and predicates are not interchangeable. these verses cannot mean that "spirit is god" or "love is god"|`|iAXmdQOEaa	I love talking about this.<br>  Ok,  first of all,  the trinity is verses taken out of context.  People DONT do the studies and research that they should.   I'll explain.<br>  <br>  John 1 v 1    "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <br>  2     The same was in the beginning with God." <br>  <br>  The NT was written in Greek.  So,  we look up the word "word" in Greek and it is "logos".  Well,  what does logos mean.  It means, "plans, reasons, someone's thoughts".    So what verse 1 is talking about is God's plans,  that's all!!!   Not Jesus!!    Jesus doesnt come into play until verse 14,  when it says that the word became flesh.  God's plans and thoughts because flesh or real.  <br>  <br>  Ok,  here's another one.  <br>  <br>  1 John 5 v 7  "For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one."<br>  <br>  That verse isnt even in the org. Greek bible!!!   It was added in hundreds of years later!!!    People dont know this because they dont take the time to study the scriptures.  <br>  <br>  The bible esp. the OT does not teach of the trinity at all!!    Jesus is not God.  In the book of Hebrews it says that Jesus was made LOWER than the angels.   Jesus could also be tempted, God cant be tempted. <br>  <br>  If Jesus is God, then Jesus knows all that God's knows.....

(Mark 12:29, or Romans 3:29-30, James 2:19) <br>  <br>  The Quran too testifies that Jews and Christians, the people of the Book, believe in one God: <br>  <br>  And dispute ye not with the People of the Book, except with means better (than mere disputation), unless it be with those of them who inflict wrong (and injury): But say, "We believe in the Revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; Our God and your God is One; and it is to Him we bow (in Islam)." (Surah 29, 'Ankabut, verse 46) <br>  CLARIFYING MISUNDERSTANDINGS <br>  <br>  The blasphemous idea of Christians worshipping three gods comes from a wrong understanding of the Trinity. In the fifth century AD there was a Christian cult called Maryanya which spread the false belief that Jesus and his mother Mary would be two separate gods besides God. The Quran was right to speak out against such impiety: <br>  <br>  And behold! God will say: "O Jesus, the son of Mary, didst thou say unto men, 'Worship me and my mother as gods in derogation of God,?' He will say: 'Glory to Thee! Never could I say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, Thou wouldst indeed have known it. Thou knowest what is in my heart, though I know not what is in Thine. For Thou knowest in full all that is hidden.'" (Surah 5 Maida, verse 116) <br>  To say, as the minority cult of the Maryanyas did, that Mary was the mother of God through whom He produced a physical son, and both were to be taken as separate gods besides God, is absurd! This ludicrous and heathen concept of the Trinity is completely condemned by both Islam and Christianity! The Quran rejects it in clear terms in Surah 4, Al Nisa, verse 171. The Trinity has also been missuderstood to mean that God is three persons and only one person at the same time and in the same sense. Neither are there three substances in one substance. In opposite to this contradictions the Christians definition of the Trinity is expressed in the Athenasian Creed: "We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; Neither confounding the Persons; nor dividing the Substance (Essence)" The word "person" is here used in the sense of "self with a particlular function." ("The Illustrated Bible Dictionary" by F.F. Bruce, IVP Leicester, 1962, see "person") <br>  <br>  The danger one faces when confronted with extreme or complicated ideas, is, "to throw the baby out with the bath-water," this means to reject everything about a matter, even the true and the good. Here is what C.S. Lewis, professor of Medieval and Renaissance literature at Cambridge University has to say about such an attitude: "If Christianity was something we were making up, of course we could make it easier. But it is not. We cannot compete, in simplicity, with people who are inventing religions. How Could we? We are dealing with Fact. Of course anyone can be simple if he has no facts to bother about." ( "Mere Christianity", Macmillan Company, New York, 1943, page 145) <br>  <br>  The main stream of Christianity throughout all the world believes in one God, the Holy Trinity. It is indeed a mystery, as God Himself is, and as eternity and infinity are. "It is held that although the doctrine is beyond the grasp of human reason, it is, like many of the formulations of physical science, not contrary to reason, and may be apprehended though it may not be comprehended by the human mind." (See, "Encyclopedia Americana", "Trinity", by F.C. Grant, Danbury, Con.: Americana Corp., 1980) <br>  <br>  The religion of Islam too faces such intellectual challenges. The Quran speaks about God anthropomorphically (it uses human terms to describe him). Orthodox Muslims do not explain the "how". Similarly, it is a fact that God's word was revealed in a book, but how the infinite can be expressed in the finite is not clarified. <br>  <br>  BIBLICAL FACTS <br>  <br>  I will tell of the kindnesses of the LORD, the deeds for which he is to be praised, according to all the LORD has done for us - yes, the many good things he has done for the house of Israel, according to his compassion and many kindnesses. He said, "Surely they are my people, sons who will not be false to me"; and so he became their Savior. In all their distress he too was distressed, and the angel of his presence saved them. In his love and mercy he redeemed them; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old. Yet they rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit. So he turned and became their enemy and he himself fought against them. (Isaiah 63:7-10) <br>  In a number of other verses in the Torah, the Old Testament, (see Genesis 1:2-3, 18:2, 2 Samuel 23:2-3, etc.) the Trinity is alluded to, even though the concept was not recognized as such by the Jews of the Old Testament. The plural Hebrew word "elohim" used for God many times in th

Even the sacrifice girls to make the so call god happy.. Woman at that time got no respect from the society.. <br>  <br>  2. Our Prophet(pbuh) was an Arabian.<br>  3. The Holy Quran is reveled for whole of the people of the world and till last day of the world. As Arabia is in the center of earth. Many people from different nation passed through Arabia. Arabic is the only language which will be alive for ever, unlike hibru.. And other language.<br>  4. Many Words in arabic language has many meaning... And Holly Quran was reveled with this beautiful words.. Which make Quran's sentence true in all ages..  It's a miracle.<br>  So that's why i think Allah revel holy quran in Arabic.. Rest Almighty Allah knows the best.<br>  <br>  *It is not necessary to supplicat in Arabic.. You can very well supplicat to Allah in your own language...<br>  <br>  But everything in Salaah must be in Arabic  like Sura must be recite in Arabic.<br>  <br>  You should know that supplication is not the part of Salaah.. But after Salaah supplication  grant much more by Allah than normal time.<br>  <br>  *It's not allow to Pray Salaah other than Arabic because Arabic words many time means more than one meaning and all the translation of Quran you can't say 100% right.. So if you recite Quran other than Arabic in Salaah you may make error...

Its briefest meaning, required by the rules of grammar and rhetoric, is this: “Each individual instance of all the sorts of praise that has been offered by whatever to whatever since pre-eternity and will be offered to post-eternity is particular to and due to the Necessarily Existent One alone, Who is named Allah.” It is as follows: “Each individual instance of all the sorts of praise” is the consequence of the definite article “al” in “al-hamd.” As for the qualification of “that has been offered by whatever,” since “praise” (hamd) is the verbal noun and the active participle has been omitted, it expresses generality in that sense. And by omitting the passive participle it again expresses universality and generality, and therefore expresses the qualification “to whatever.” As for the qualification of “from pre-eternity to post-eternity,” it expresses this meaning because the rule of transposing from a verbal clause to a noun clause indicates continuity. The prepositional “lam” in “lillah” [to God], expresses the meaning of sole possession and worthiness. As for the qualification of “the Necessarily Existent One, Who is named Allah,” since necessary existence is the necessary requisite of the Godhead and a term signifying the All-Glorious Essence; comprising all the Divine Names and attributes and being the Greatest Name, the Name of “Allah” necessarily indicates both the necessaary existence and the title of “Necessarily Existent One.” <br>  If the shortest apparent meaning of the phrase “All praise be to God” on which all the scholars of Arabic are agreed is thus, how could it be translated into another language with the same miraculousness and power?<br>  Furthermore, among all the languages of the world, there is only one which can compare with Arabic in being ‘the language of grammar,’ and that can never achieve the comprehensiveness of Arabic. Is it possible for translations made by means of other composite and inflectional languages by people whose understanding is partial, comprehension short, ideas confused, and hearts dark, to take the place of the sacred words of the Qur’an, which have emerged in miraculous fashion in that comprehensive and wondrous grammatical language within an all-encompassing knowledge which knows all its aspects at once and wills them. I can even say, and perhaps prove, that each of the Qur’an’s words is like a treasury of truths, with sometimes a single letter teaching a page of truths.

Christians have the same basic morality as anyone else. Do all non-Christians go walking the streets seeking to commit crimes at every opportunity? Of course they don't, and neither do all Christians. If someone were only behaving themselves due to of a threat of divine retribution, they would be psychologically unbalanced.

I have found R!A Christians reluctant to answer any hypothetical question.<br>  <br>  What if evidence were produced that convinced you g-d does not exist with certainty (evidence according to your standards of proof)? What would you change in your life?<br>  <br>  - Would you stop evangelizing?<br>  - Would you start sinning more?<br>  - Would you stop helping those less fortunate than you?<br>  - Would you feel that life is meaningless?<br>  - Would you lose your Raison d'être?<br>  <br>  Atheists such as myself have real moral values perform mitzvahs not for the sake of salvation, but because moral codes and performing good deeds and helping those in need is the right thing to do. <br>  <br>  Many (not all!) people choose Christianity for the reward of salvation or to avoid the punishment of hell. That's known as Pascal's wager. I don't consider these folks Christian or religious at all. To me, a true Christian would accept Christ without regard to salvation, would not crow about being saved, would not condemn others, and would even take that John 3:16 oath of allegiance knowing that g-d might hypothetically punish them.|`|i0Ydiqj2aa	Not all Christians at like that.

Well, a lot of them would yes.<br>  Because if you discover that the concept of pure goodness and love don't exist and we are all just freaks of nature and that for millions of years we've just being evolving by learning how better to kill each other. Survival of the fittest, natural selection, etc.<br>  Many will feel, why not be an % hole?

The desire and focus of every christian is to acquire these fine natures so that they can be good, not because God is watching, but because it is their nature to be good. When something becomes your nature, you can't do otherwise than manifest that nature. You do good because it is your nature to be good; doing bad would be contrary to your nature, and you would hate to do something contrary to your nature.

e834d8db36b13de567ab48eb9cdaf267aa	Your question is a very legitimate one. There are some people, even among religious leaders, who oppose any form of re-baptism.<br>  <br>  For instance, in 1996, the General Conference of the United Methodist Church, in a convention conducted in Denver, Colorado, debated the matter of re-baptism. A position paper, issued by the conference, declared that Methodists who were baptized as infants should never be baptized again. The document explicitly stated: “Whether a baptized infant grows up to be a professing Christian or not, that baptism stands valid.”<br>  <br>  This position is flawed in many particulars, having no scriptural support whatsoever.<br>  <br>  New Testament Precedent<br>  While on his third missionary campaign, the apostle Paul came to the city of Ephesus. There, he encountered twelve men who formerly had been baptized (with the type of baptism administered by John the Baptizer). One might be inclined to conclude, therefore, that the apostle would have accepted these men as they were, and merely organized them into a church.<br>  <br>  Such was not the case, however. After questioning them as to the nature of their earlier baptism, and determining that their pre-baptism instruction on the previous occasion had been lacking in essential particulars, Paul immersed these men into Christ (see Acts 19:1-5).<br>  <br>  This case clearly demonstrates that in order for one’s baptism to be valid, accurate teaching must precede the rite. Otherwise it is but a meaningless exercise, and not based on faith (Romans 10:17).<br>  <br>  True Baptism—A One-time Act<br>  Genuine baptism is needed only one time in a person’s life. Once a person has been baptized, according to the full complement of scriptural instructions, he or she never has the need to repeat this “new birth” process (cf. John 3:3-5).<br>  <br>  After a person has entered the family of Christ through baptism (1 Corinthians 12:13; cf. Galatians 3:26-27), he or she is a part of the church, the household of God (1 Timothy 3:15; cf. Ephesians 2:19-22). The new Christian thus has access to all of the spiritual benefits of the “in Christ” relationship (Ephesians 1:3). As a son or daughter of God, within that sacred environment, the Christian petitions the heavenly Father for his or her personal needs by means of prayer (see Acts 8:22,24; cf. James 5:16), including forgiveness for sins as a child who will err (cf. 1 John 1:8; 2:1).<br>  <br>  Baptismal Qualifications<br>  Unfortunately, there are many sects in today’s world of “Christendom” that practice a “form of baptism,” but one that is contaminated by the accompaniment of a variety of doctrinal errors that invalidate the process. It is the case, therefore, that many who have been administered what was called “baptism,” need to submit to the ordinance again—this time with a more accurate understanding that precedes the event.<br>  <br>  Here are some situations in which “re-baptism” would be warranted.<br>  <br>  Infants<br>  If one was “baptized” as an infant, thus was lacking personal faith (Mark 16:16; Acts 11:21), he should repudiate the meaningless earlier rite, in which he had no decision-making power (even though his parents were sincere in subjecting him to the procedure). He, in genuine faith, should submit to the command in the proper way. Infants have neither the need nor the ability to respond to the gospel of Christ.<br>  <br>  Baptism without immersion<br>  If one was “baptized” in some fashion other than by immersion (which actually expresses a contradictory concept, since “baptize” means “immerse”), then he should yield to the proper form. True baptism reflects the candidate’s understanding that this ordinance pictures the burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The sinner is buried in, and raised from, water (cf. Romans 6:3-4; Colossians 2:12), just as the Lord was buried, and then raised from the dead.<br>  <br>  True baptism validates one’s faith in the death and resurrection events. Being sprinkled with water, or having water poured upon the head, is no baptism at all, and such substitutes are without sanction in the New Testament. They are post-apostolic innovations.<br>  <br>  Baptism without repentance...<br>  <br>  Baptism without faith...<br>  <br>  Baptism without purpose<br>  If one has yielded to baptism for some purpose other than that which is supplied by inspired teaching, he, in reality, has not obeyed the Lord. Baptism is never defined as “an outward sign of an inward grace”; it is not a mere representation of redemption for those already received.<br>  <br>  The purpose of the act is “for the remission of sins” (Acts 2:38), to have sins “washed away” (Acts 22:16), to put the candidate “into Christ” (Romans 6:3-4; Galatians 3:26-27), or into his “body” (1 Corinthians 12:13), at which point he is “saved” (Mark 16:16; 1 Peter 3:21). The common resistance to the biblical proposition, namely that baptism is preliminary to salvation, constitutes a bold rejection of the plain testimony of Scripture. One cannot be immersed “for the remission of sins” (Acts 2:38), if he believes his sins have been remitted already|`|1UokhVRXaa	not a problem. but not needed.|`|2d2ZuimCaa	This will help you with your question..<a href="http://www.fbbc.com/messages/baptizedbutlost.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbbc.com/messages/baptizedbut...</a>|`|AA11220299	In most cases it would not be necessary, but it might be OK in certain circumstances.

Is it "needed" to be baptized again, no it isnt but if the person feels that this will help them to start anew and have a closer walk with the Lord, if they feel this is something that the Holy Spirit is leading them to to reinforce the choice they have made of re-dedication... then by all means do so.|`|91d4fbc3c75e4f7b862432c431187afcaa	There is nothing wrong, because if you were baptized as an infant, that don't count, & if you were baptized using the TITLES of father, son, & holy ghost is a incorrect way to be baptized, Throughtout the bible after John the Baptize & Jesus Christ, everyone was re-baptized in the Nmae of the Lord Jesus Christ Acts 2:38 fulfills Matt. 28:19|`|PWankIUpaa	No,<br>      There are many reasons why a person would want to reaffirm the Witness of Baptism. <br>  1 As the Witness of the Outward sign of the inner change that happened at salvation.<br>  2 Joining a new Church as a witness to the Congregation of your salvation of your belief.<br>  3 There is no place in the Holy Bible where it states that this witness is to be  made only once.<br>  <br>  You see Baptism is a picture of the reality of Salvation.

But man is no abstract being squatting outside the world. Man is the world of man—state, society. This state and this society produce religion, which is an inverted consciousness of the world, because they are an inverted world. Religion is the general theory of this world, its encyclopedic compendium, its logic in popular form, its spiritual point d'honneur, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement, and its universal basis of consolation and justification. It is the fantastic realization of the human essence since the human essence has not acquired any true reality. The struggle against religion is, therefore, indirectly the struggle against that world whose spiritual aroma is religion. Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo.

Your sun sign is Leo .<br>  <br>  Hence grab a newspaper and see the last paper and check your sun sign based on date of birth. Ashwini star has nothing to do in sun sign.<br>  <br>  The Indian zodiac sign is based on the horoscope based on date of birth , place and time.

Western system uses so called moving zodiac or coordinate system called Sayana while Vedic system uses fixed or Nirayana system. But for astrological predictions using the basic planetary coordinates there is a gulf of difference between Western and Vedic system. In Western system the intricacies are not there and interpretation of planetary interactions are limited, while in Vedic system the tools and the depth of application is limited only by the depth of ones knowledge and interest with many cross checking and confirmation tests. <br>  In Western system all the planets including those discovered in 19th Century – viz Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are generally used. In a mixed system some Indian astrologers use Sayana and these extra Saturn planets with the names of Indra Varuna and Yama. Vedic system uses mainly the two luminaries and five other planets but include two “CHAYA” shadow planets viz Rahu and Ketu. Their importance can be judged from Physics definition of UMBRA and PENUMBRA points when two luminaries interact. The importance of these becomes evident by the fact that an eclipse occurs whenever luminaries and these fall in a straight line. <br>  <br>  In interpretation Western system uses only angular distances between planets – treating 120 and 60 as good and 90 and 45 as bad. The others like 180, 72, 30, 0 etc are also considered. The timing also is very static – only progressions are taken as 1 degree = I year of life, 1 day = I year of life etc. i.e., whenever say a planet is in 14 degrees of a house and another at say 24 of same house – at the age of 10 both are conjunct. Thus by these progressions the timing is calculated and the type of angular distance determines the event. The houses are of equal duration, which does not take the latitude effect of place. The Gochara or effect of current planetary positions is accounted by the angles they form with birth planets. Thus over all the methods of interpretations of western system is simple arithmetic and static. <br>  <br>  In contrast Vedic system introduces a unique frame of reference called Lagna or ascendant, which is the Eastern horizon point at the time of birth. Thus all the spatial coordinates of place of birth are taken in each birth. Lagna forms the starting point and from there different bhavas are defined to account for different aspects of our life. The planetary relations are also classified as benefic/ evil, naturally friendly/ foe and dynamically friendly/ foe etc. The houses or bhavas are also classified as good and bad. Synthesis and analysis are basic tools in any scientific study. In Vedic astrology also such tools are extensively used. The bhavas are not of equal duration but astronomical effects are accounted by Sripathi method of Bhava Sphutam. The strength of planets is also calculated by many methods including graha balas, which take into account their absolute positions relative positions etc. Thus planets have complex properties like naturally good / bad, positionally good / bad and different strengths to do that good or bad. The rules are also dynamic in that for many rules have exceptions where the rule has to be over ruled. When ever a gross examination does not answer a complex question in a scientific field one goes to microscopic examination. Having AMSA charts where the house is divided into microscopic units - uses same principle. In this one go in depth to a particular activity like profession marriage etc. Thus one can devise charts where a house is divided to 1/3,1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/7,1/8 1/9,1/10, 1/11, 1/12, 1/16, 1/20, 1/27, 1/30 an 1/60 – each representing a different aspect of life. The timing is also followed by what is called Dasa system – in fact many dasa systems like Vimsottari, Ashtottari etc exist and one has to apply correct dasa system. <br>  <br>  The Gochara is also very finely tuned by different methods like present-day movements of planets vis a vis birth position of moon. In fact a more complex system exists called Ashtakavarga which is a 12 by 8 matrix – i.e., the position of 7 planets and lagna in 12 houses at birth interacting with present day planetary positions of 12 by 8 matrix. The mathematical tools used in the evaluation of these is mind boggling – if we note that the evaluation rules of Matrix are hardly 3 centuries old – the evaluation rules of Ashtakavarga – like if there is a zero in a row (Column) cancel that, Subtract smallest number from highest number etc proves the depth of Vedic mathematics used – which are at least thousands of years old. The Gochara is not limited to these and has other methods like Nilakhanthas solar return horoscope or Tajaka system to give accurate yearly results. <br>  <br>  While all these go under the head of Parasara system we have the complex Jaimini system with its complex rules. Thus Vedic astrology is a ocean of nectar and any one of us can enjoy only a drop of the same as per our luck an|`|K4IaWDZnaa	ok.......... i'll answer u somethin very simple <br>  look the matter is tht the sun sign which u get in newspaper is according to the english calender, and the one according to birthdate and all is according to the moons angles!<br>  so some people believe it according to the moons and act according to tht like if a pandit says that u need to do this bcause of ur sunsign problems ,,,,, people agree to it! and reading the newspaper everyone is sooooo crazzzy!!!<br>  it actually dends on ur deeds wht is written in ur life it will happen no one can stop it!<br>  let it happen as it is!<br>  just do goood deeds............<br>  all d best for ur future!!!<br>  bye ;)!!!

It was much easier to tell people pork was against God's will rather than explain that it must be cooked to an internal temperature 150 degrees or you could get sick and die.

What do MOST people MEAN when they say they have a relationship with Christ?  What? they maybe pray to him at the beginning or end of the day...they sing songs on Sunday.<br>  Does that a relationship make?<br>  <br>  Don't we do things for the person we're in a relationship with? Don't we show them respect?  Don't we put aside what we want for THEM?<br>  <br>  The Catholic faith itself is VERY simple. Less restrictive then MOST. It simply believes in "faith working thru love" -- that is,  living out our faith each and everyday.    You have faith, faith brings about love,  love demands that we express it.  -- that's it.  You simply do the best you can and ask for forgiveness when you screw up. How simple is THAT?<br>  <br>  THEN, layered on TOP of that, are NUMEROUS ways to help you live and express your relationship with Christ.  Many "helpers" along the way. <br>  Communion is a physical way for God to impart grace (undeserved gift) on people.  The saints and feast days are ways to help us follow the examples of others. Intercessory prayer (aka asking Mary for help) is a way to ask help of those who are in heaven who aren't sinning anymore and have a direct connection to God. <br>  <br>  The Catholic faith has a lot of helpers and ways to draw you in closer to Jesus. -- You, yourself, said that's what it really is all about. Right?<br>  <br>  How good of a relationship can you honestly have with Jesus if you don't visit him at Church, don't pray to him, don't accept the gifts he extends, don't show him respect, don't try to show restraint by fasting, etc. ???  How good can the relationship truly be?<br>  <br>  The Catholic faith is very deep,  I'll give ya that.  You can't possibly do it ALL.  There is just too much.  Just like a true relationship, there are SOO MANY ways to express it,  we can't possibly do it all. <br>  <br>  So in Catholicism, you aren't expected to do it all,  you do what you can, you try your best, and in the end, you CHOOSE to do the things which make YOU feel closest to God.  <br>  <br>  Catholicism is like a BUFFET  -- you have your choice of anything that is on the table. The table is large.  Everything on the table has been pre-approved for you to eat and is healthy for you.<br>  <br>  ______________________________<br>  <br>  Beyond that, ALSO realize that the Catholic church is the only christian religion with a direct connection all the way back to the apostles. Our CORE beliefs, separate from the "practices" of the faith,  are the beliefs which the apostles taught.  Our Bishops, have the same abilities passed on to the apostles themselves. That is.. to forgive men's sins and to transabstantiate wine and bred into the body and blood of Christ. <br>  <br>  The Catholic church compiled and decided what went INTO the bible.  It GAVE the world the bible. Nothing in it can TRULY contradict what the Catholic church believes or practices, although many churches may have alternative interpretations, they are just that.. alternative interpretations. <br>  <br>  The Catholic church has given the world the greatest Theologians and Philosophers of all time  and thought long and hard about every aspect of Christianity in its nearly 2,000 years of existence. There is arguably NOTHING you can ask or think that the Catholic church has not already formed an opinion on. <br>  <br>  Because the Catholic faith believes at its head is the successor to the Apostle Peter, we believe we have someone at the top who can give us definitive answers when we need to settle interpretational differences.  This has kept the Catholic faith whole, while other denominations have continually splintered off over doctrinal issues. The IRS lists over 30,000 registered Christian denominations in the US alone.<br>  <br>  The Catholic church is also the largest provider of health care, education and charity in the world.  Most of the people who get help can't fully pay for their services. The Catholic Universities are some of the most respected.  Catholic Priests themselves are responsible for the field of Genetics (Mendel )and the theory of the Big Bang (Lemaitre)  The Catholic church is the largest Christian denomination to officially state that Evolution is NOT contrary to the bible. (however it leads the decision of which creation theory to follow up to each individual Catholic to decide for themselves)<br>  <br>  Since the Vatican is a sovereign nation, the Catholic church has a seat on the UN Council, allowing it to be involved and help shape world policies and humanitarian efforts. <br>  The Vatican itself has  one of the world's busiest Pharamacies and is open to the public. There is no sales tax in the Vatican and the pharmacy sells many medicines at cost and gives 60% discounts on others. It stocks medicines from all over the world and is the only place in Europe where certain rare imported medicines can be found.<br>  <br>  Each non-catholic christian denomination splintered off from Catholicism and therefore represents a PART of what the Catholic church teacings.  Sole Scriptura,(bible alone) Sole Fide, (faith alone) Sole Gracia (grace alone),  and even "Once saved always saved", are but PARTS of the Catholic teaching.  The Catholic church can easily incorporate all of them and then some. Where as, because they are more narrow, they can NOT expand to incorporate some of the Catholic teachings.<br>  <br>  In the end,  Non-Catholic believe there is NO infallible (perfect) teaching or interpretation of the bible, that EACH person should read the bible for themselves and thru prayer and reflection on scripture, decide what it means to THEM.<br>  However, in practice, they don't extend this same respect to Catholics and act as if THEIR personal interpretation is fact or infallible. So while they condemn the Catholic church for believing the Pope can settle matters of interpretation,  they in practice, are acting just the same, giving themselves the same level of infallibility when they condemn what the Catholic church teaches.  And use the bible which the Catholic church created to do so.  Ironic isn't it??|`|AA11923447	I'm Catholic. I just think of some of the rules (such as the Ash Wednesday fasting) as a bit of spiritual discipline. Frankly, spiritual discipline (or self-discipline of any type) seems to have gone missing from many denominations. There's nothing wrong with taking some time to think seriously about one's religion and acting accordingly. Many different spiritual paths work on subduing the ego, and Catholicism has picked up that work, as well. In short, the rules are a reminder that it's not all about us, our wants, and our desires.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	Thats how it is|`|VWvI5RyBaa	I'm a Catholic and I don't understand your question.  No it's not a cult like answerer 1 mentioned.  We don't have more rules than other religions.  As a matter of a fact, I find that we have a lot less rules to follow than a lot of other religions.<br>  What is it with people who say that Catholics are not Christians?  We are Chritians and there's nothing you can do about it.  We believe in Christ(Christians).|`|AA11796124	<<Why are their so many rules in the Catholic religion?>><br>  <br>  So many rules such as? I'm sure you can't really name "so many", probably only a few, and "few" is not many.<br>  <br>  <br>  <<When the only thing that really matters is our relationship with God or Jesus.>><br>  <br>  And that relationship entails doing God's Will - via the Rules He puts in place for us. If you choose not to follow these rules, you choose not to follow Jesus.|`|AA10034051	What do you mean by rules? Obeying the Lord and doing what is best for us thru His will. I embrace Jesus Christ's Catholic Church with all that is in me. A few rules never hurt anyone|`|AA11521494	Firstly, catholicism is not a religion - it is a branch of Christianity.<br>  <br>  Secondly, there are just as many rules in any other branch of Christianity.  The relationship with god necessarily implies that you are trying not to sin... and what is that other than trying to follow a long list of rules?  Otherwise, you are saying that you have a relationship with god and you can do what you like, which is not biblical.|`|Ex4Lv68yaa	Because you must remember that "all" religion was made by mankind.  There are as many religions as there are opinions about God.  All different, all quarreling over which one is 'right.'<br>  <br>  None of them are right, none of them are true.  Your own heart is True.  :)  In revelation it warns everyone of false religions, which are all over the place today.  If there was a correct religion, it would have been named in revelation.  Religion is a choice.  It isn't a requirement for seeking God.<br>  <br>  You are correct, the only thing that matters is your own relationship with what you feel the Creator is within your own heart.   :)  <br>  <br>  All of the religious fanatics can just mind their own business and stop casting stones at everyone that doesn't conform to their distorted belief systems...|`|f8mLpPXlaa	The "rules" have evolved over many generations in response to what was perceived to be problems with faith, protocol and proper worship of Christ the Lord.<br>  Granted many of them  now look outdated and seemingly senseless but they all had the original purpose of bringing us closer to God.<br>  For myself I have come to regard them as tradition rather than rules per se.<br>  I disagree with churches that change with the times, so to speak, as if they felt a fad or particular style of the day was important to attract younger parishoners.<br>  The Church has been stable and a balwark of strength by not changing to conform to some new thing that in 10 or 50 years will likely be "out of style" and then what will happen? Will the Church have to change again?<br>  God is immortal and the way we express our love for Him should be also.|`|67e4501c0c56a505b86d4b14fc9a8330aa	Yes, the thing that matters is our relationship with God AND our relationship with others.  Your question never mentioned anything about relationships with other people.  God said to love Him and love our neighbor as ourselves.<br>  <br>  There are many rules because Catholics believe that our faith should influence and have a bearing on EVERY aspect of our lives, not just our religious practices.  The rules help us to byuild a better relationship with God and others.|`|wxBFZ41Taa	Rules? I don't see them as rules, I see them as love. When something is as important as God, rules are just expressions of love. <br>  <br>  Think about the important things in our country. The more important, the more specific the rules. In front of the Tomb of the Unknown Solider, a guard walks a specific number of steps, does specific turns, rifle moves, etc. over and over always precise...never altering or resting...why? Because it's important. If you were to visit the Tomb and saw the guard sitting down, feet up, head phones on, you'd think...I guess it's not really that important. The guard might say "well in my heart and mind I'm walking back and forth with my rifle" -- would that be good enough? No! The little things, rules, do matter because when something is really important, when we want to communicate just how much we love, and care, we keep the rules out of love.|`|7hpXsYOCaa	To keep the followers in line.|`|nCU4mgbHaa	What do you mean by so many rules?|`|bglr4m0Naa	I agree with you on that.|`|hVVALFAPaa	You are right. The only thing that does matter is our relationship with God. Period.<br>  <br>  However, humans --being the simple weaklings that we are-- need guidelines or rules to show us how that relationship should go.<br>  <br>  These 'rules' were made by other humans in an attempt to explain what they thought God wanted us to do, how He wanted us to act. Some of them do seem a bit 'useless' on the surface, but when you study and look into WHY they were put into place, they actually start to make sense.<br>  <br>  You really don't have to say/do/think certain things to have God love you. He does even without those 'things.' He knows what is in your heart and that is all that really matters.|`|q1EDNQhBaa	Well my opinion is the whole thing is a controll issue. I think your right why should you have to do so many things but other people will say you have to earn your relationship with god etc. It is only because in my opinion it makes them feel really important and gives them an excuse to lecture other people. Im not religous at all but if you believe then that should be enough. Be happy with that and dont feel like you should have to prove it. And to be fair, all of these people lecturing you saying you should do this and that! How would they know? Really. They wouldnt! Everyone takes everything differently, which is why were all so unique so if your happy just believing and not doing what everyone else says you should ... then good on you! good luck xx|`|QyXjTX5caa	....I agree with you...i think there are so many rules in "Religions" in general...but they aren't important AT ALL.......and so....it doesn't matter if you follow these rules....isn't it???...i'm not following the most of the rules of the Catholic Church...but I believe to God and that's the only important thing.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Of course not!  If they did, why would you be asking?|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Yes!|`|Tv8cuXmtaa	No<br>  there are morons who file there teeth down and pretend to be, some even kill to make it seem more real but those are the people that are mentally unstable.<br>  So vampires indeed do not exist, but morons who pretend to be do.|`|uYVyEZ7Aaa	yeah, havent you seen twilight??<br>  <br>  IDIOT|`|CZsjZCzVaa	Their under your bed!!!!|`|k6CSa9caaa	No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|12w7YjRTaa	No. People say they exist but it's a theory.

(Although we hardly resemble the fictional Hollywood stereotype.)<br>  <br>  Some of us have even begun to shed the title vampire, which began by switching it to vampyre to show the difference between RPG and real vampyrism, and now the term has even been cast aside for other terminologies altogether by some, although there are many amongst us who prefer to stick to the traditional term for various reasons. <br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question.|`|v14DyoP5aa	I believe they do. The skeptic few think they don't because they always lay low, so they tend to go unnoticed.|`|WOOKNMgmaa	yeah vampires do exist... the ppl just don't want to believe there is something more Superior than humans... can you prove that we don't exist...?|`|KOd5Spehaa	yea they are everywhere nowadays, my neighbor's a vamp hes cool tho he drinks like a champ too|`|a1gSZzoyaa	ya definitely how could you not know that...lol they don't really exist ,,,|`|BKTaXdsuaa	Well, SOMEthing bit me last night.|`|NiRFYhVDaa	im afraid to say yes
I7YwG0Mcaa	I don't think that affirmative action as it is now should continue because it is only based on race. What cripples a child's chances in this world is the financial status of their parents. Do we really think that Tiger Wood's kids or Obama's children will have fewer opportunities than a poor white kid living in a trailer home whose father works in a coal mine in West Virginia? Its ridiculous that even if the university didnt now who they were the children of Obama would be given preferential status for college admissions over that kid from WV. At University of Michigan simply having black skin was equal to having a perfect score on the SAT. <br>  Privilege does exist, the system is not fair and racism is out there too, however most of the privilege in the sytem is based on money, not skin color. If a poor black man had stabbed his white ex-wife and her new white boyfriend to death he would be in jail but O.J. Simpson got off and the reason is that he could hire Johnny Cochran. <br>  Lets have affirmative action based only on financial status.|`|nv5Mewe3aa	I have plenty of friends of different race/ ethnicity who are successful, well educated, and elevated socially. Many of them more so than me. I am "middle class" and AM NOT white. The barriers have been broken, however there are those who still want someone, something to blame for what is clearly a lack of discipline, effort, and integrity. I have seen first hand the poor ATTITUDES of those types of people when it comes to work, their education, their community. Quite frankly I find them to be hypocritical most of the time.|`|rVPrhd26aa	no... i think it's the other way around.<br>  there are programs for free college tuition or loans for African and Latino Americans but not a single thing like this exists for exclusively white people.<br>  there are schools that are exclusively for African Americans but if a white school was opened it would be shut down and called racist.<br>  I don't know what privileges white people have.<br>  I have heard someone say that white people don't get harassed by the police, but that isn't true because I get harassed by the police all the time. I've been arrested 4 times and once was for something I didn't even do.... cops are just scum bags no matter what race you are.<br>  I don't think the level of racism in America is as high as people might think. Sure down south people are still messed up in the head on the stuff and they are wrong, but for the most part i would say 80% of America is not racist.|`|IMPh53Ssaa	nope white people are always portrayed as the bad guy now,<br>  <br>  But I will fight for my rights|`|w6djKRNSaa	LOL!!!|`|sZ0McynSaa	Not at all, just the opposite is going on...|`|DvZdB66maa	Yes, white privilege still exists. White people who say it doesn't are in denial... they are so used to certain things that they don't even realize their own privileges and advantages. Most white people, if they are really being honest with themselves, can see that there are advantages to being White in the United States...<br>  <br>  - When you walk into a store, you are not immediately followed by employees who think you will steal something. (Edit: And if you ARE followed, it is because you just LOOK suspicious... but you can be SURE that it has nothing to do with your race. Meanwhile, a Black person could be dressed very nicely and STILL be followed).<br>  <br>  -- If you drive down the street in a nice, expensive car, you are not followed by police who assume that you probably stole the vehicle or acquired it through illegal means.<br>  <br>  - When you do well in school and excel above your classmates, you don't have to worry about your instructor being shocked, saying, "Wow! You're really smart!" as if that's unusual for someone of your race.<br>  <br>  - Since this society is still controlled by Whites, you don't have to worry about the insitution of racism. Even if you are discriminated against because you are White, what effect can it really have on you other than hurt feelings?? On the other hand, Blacks and other minorities can be passed over for jobs and have their resumes tossed out simply because they have an ethnic-sounding name. (And affirmative action does not hurt you... It only gives an equal chance, preventing discrimination -- NOT just hiring or accepting Blacks SOLELY because they are Black. Maybe the Whites who think that unqualified Blacks get into schools and jobs over them are just too racist to believe that perhaps it's just that the Black person was MORE QUALIFIED THAN YOU. Stop and think about that for a minute. That, in and of itself, shows white privilege.... White people will ALWAYS assume that if you get into a good school or a good job, it's only because of affirmative action and you just COULDN'T have really been qualified... which goes back to my previous point).<br>  <br>  -- You are recognized as an individual. You can chew your food with your mouth open, join a gang, have bad credit, flunk out of school, or be a serial rapist without having it being attributed to your race! If a Black person or other minority did any one of those things, it would be blamed on our entire race. When we step out into the world, we are essentially representative of our entire race. We are NOT seen as individuals by society.<br>  <br>  -- If you don't make it in this world, you only have yourself to blame. A poor white person has a greater chance of making it than a rich black person... If Shameika Johnson is going up for a job against Becky Sue Taylor... even if Shameika came from a good home and a rich neighborhood and Becky Sue came from the backwoods of Kentucky, Shameika will be discriminated against solely because of her name and race. People will make assumptions about her and may choose not to hire her. (If one believes racism no longer exists, they need only to turn on their television or read a newspaper!!)<br>  <br>  -- If White privilege does not exist, then why is there such a disproportionate amount of minorities living in poverty in comparison to Whites?? Do you think these people would CHOOSE to live in poverty? You may think that the effects of slavery are over, but they aren't. Many Whites gained wealth from the work of slaves that still exists within their families today... Black slaves were the ones that did the work and they and their families never benefitted from it. Then, there was segregation which forced Blacks into unequal housing and schooling... this has been a viscious cycle... If you are being unequally educated, then how do you acquire the skills to make it in this world and bring yourself out of poverty??? Money doesn't just drop out of the sky for these people.<br>  <br>  -- You can turn on the television and see people of your race WIDELY represented.... from preppy to goth to skater to jock and everything inbetween. Minorities turn on the television and see stereotypes of people within their race. As a result, society assumes that ALL Blacks or ALL Hispanics have the SAME opinions and act the SAME way... They fail to recognize that we are as diverse as Whites. If a Black person even SPEAKS, then supposedly that is the "Black voice of America." That is seen as the "Black opinion." WTF?<br>  <br>  -- You can be pretty sure that an argument with a colleague of another race is more likely to jeopardize HIS/HER chances of advancement than yours.<br>  <br>  -- If you even acknowledge that racism exists, you are a HERO.... But if a Black or other minority brings up racism, they are "playing the race card". You can talk about how Whites have it soooo bad (LOL... WTF) and how they are reversely discriminated against (again, LOL) with no one saying anything, as if that's okay... but if a Black person talks about the discrimination they have faced, they are "playing the race card."<br>  <br>  -- You never even have to worry about the POSSIBILITY of being discriminated against, to the point that it could severely affect the direction in which your life takes.<br>  <br>  -- You can go through life every day without being reminded of your race. I am pretty sure that EVERY Black person has, at some point, been the ONLY Black person somewhere, or one of a few... so we are constantly reminded that we are Black... However, you never have to be reminded of your race because, generally, everyone around you is the same race as you. I was made aware of this concept when I took a tour of Chinatown with a group of White people and one of them kept saying he felt "out of his element" and "didn't really like being there"... I could not understand WHY!!... but then, when it all came out, he said that he "felt like a minority" (of course, forgetting that I was there!! He tried to catch the words but it was too late!! LOL)... So if White people don't like being the minority, how do they think we feel EVERY DAY???<br>  <br>  -- If you wanted to, you could arrange your life so that you would never have to deal with another person of color ever again... never seeing one in your neighborhood or even watching them in the media... and all of this could be done with you living a successful lifestyle in a nice, upscale neighborhood.<br>  <br>  -- You can walk into any store that sells makeup and find your shade of foundation in any texture, brand, or type that you like! (BTW, why do most makeup brands carry like FIFTEEN shades of white and only 3-4 shades for darker skin tones???... when white people are all generally the same color, yet there is a HUGE diversity in the skin color of Black people.... HOW does that even make sense???)<br>  <br>  <br>  I could go on and on... but, for the White people who insist that white privilege no longer exists... I have one question... ARE YOU SERIOUS???|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	When things go poorly in the life of a white man, he has no one to blame.<br>  <br>  Minorities have the luxury of blaming someone else for "keeping them down".|`|AtY7izyHaa	U got this----> $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ u get to use the well lit plenty of<br>  <br>  polished lighted mirrors air rated, plenty of privacy and even a speaker <br>  <br>  playing elevator music bathroom, or comfort station, as they are <br>  <br>  called in $$$$$$$$$$$$ circles, you don't, you take a number and<br>  <br>  stand in line waiting for a vacancy in the out house, regardless of<br>  <br>  color stature nationality or what ever else one can think of to divide<br>  <br>  us more than we all ready are, in this day and age . . .|`|aKirAFKdaa	No, today it is all about your income and class.

YwDbuXOWaa	Yes it is illegal to have sex with anyone if you , or the person is under the age of 16. becuase you both are that means yes.<br>  <br>  <br>  and to any douche bag that says its ok, you really are idiots.<br>  <br>  ITS NOT!!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Just because other people have done it does not mean that it is ok, or legal. How many people your age have done drugs or alcohol? does that make it legal? no.<br>  <br>  Seriously.. it just added more pressure and problems. STI's ETC|`|u8CFwtyMaa	It depends on the age of consent in the country, or state, that you live in.<br>  In the UK it's 16, but if both were under 16, I don't know if it's actually illegal or not.<br>  Hope this helps|`|KzNv0gmaaa	It depends where you live, in most places it would be illegal, though if anyone found out you wouldn't get in trouble with the law. I think you really should wait at least a couple more years though, while you might think you are old enough to handle the emotional consequences you really aren't.|`|3EZfZ8gwaa	It is illegal, but the police turn a blind eye to it because your both the same age... Beside that, is one of you going to kiss and tell the police?|`|ocy7FEcaaa	It all depends on where you live. In some places its illegal and in others it's ok.|`|AA10034000	NO, you both can decide to have sex and that is fine. Good luck!|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	Against the law if your caught- that's the question. Yes<br>  <br>  But teenage boys who have had same sexual experiences or experimenting is really a normal behavioral activity and certainly not uncommon. If the other boy is a willing participant and it's not being done against his will such as a rape, it's okay. Just don't get caught and enjoy.|`|DKQ8BcO6aa	Actually it is. Unlike straight couples, gay couples have to weight until they are 18 to have sex. It is homophobic, but it is also against the law. Wait a while until you are sure that a gay relationship is what you want an then at 18 go for it.|`|WZ0jWRasaa	Nope. I mean sure, you're technically 'underage' but it's not illegal if you both give consent.

It doesn't matter that a lot of people around your age at school are doing it as well; they're breaking the law too.<br>  <br>  Really, I'd say wait so it's something to look forward to and you can sure it with someone you really care about and who really cares about it.<br>  <br>  But if you're both prepared for it, we can't stop you, the law aside.<br>  <br>  Just remember to stay safe. :)|`|7nHuDxivaa	If you're both the same age its legal, but make sure you are safe and feel like its what you want to do and not what's expected.|`|Sf7TUMJoaa	Hun, I know being a young gay teen is tough, but illegal or not, you shouldn't rush into sex.

qcQm8eIbaa	Greek mythology is delightful to get into.<br>  <br>  Go to your library, and begin at the fairy tale section.

Stop by and ask them to show you the greek mythology section.<br>  <br>  Grab a book or two and start reading.<br>  <br>  Oh and personally I prefer Norse Mythology. the Greek Gods were interesting, but with it comes to Greek and Roman culture their life styles were much more entertaining.|`|BG7Wm3Bcaa	If you're interested in the ancient sources, one of the earliest writings on the Greek gods is Hesiod's Theogony.  If you want something a little more fun, check out a translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses.  It's pretty entertaining.|`|AA11367192	Greek Mythology is one of the best mythologies i've ever read....if you want to know everything about it you should start since the beginning. it start with Chaos that divided into Gaia ( the earth) and Uranus (god of sky and heavens) Uranus married Gaia they had the Titans as their children. It goes on and on... how Uranus's son Cronus, gelded his father , because he wanted to take the control of the universe and he threw his father's testicles in the ocean and so on...you should read about it....it's really beautiful but i recommend you to read the myth of Oedipus. It's one of the best stories....

This is called love at first sight.|`|Z4avhg3eaa	I once heard someone joke that he met no less than 30 occultists who claimed to be Aleister Crowley in a past life, which was funny to him because each of them had roughly 1/30 of Crowley's command of the English language. <br>  <br>  I honestly don't know the answer about multiple personalities, and I'm not going to weigh in on that.  Since I don't have a complete set of past life memories, I can't comment on how it works in that regard.<br>  <br>  Which major historical figure was I in the past...it doesn't matter.

I just seem to have more things and comfort in this one than in any other.

As one who formerly called myself atheist I feel for you. One point I would like to make is something I found out to be absolutely true. You say you did your homework and this seems absolutely logical to a man that God is learned. That we think things out and reach a conclusion based on our logic and understanding. What we fail to realize is that God is greater than our understanding. God's truth  really isn't learned but is received from God through the spirit. God is an eternal spirit and we are finite flesh and we can not completely comprehend God but that we receive this truth through the spirit. Many people confuse faith as blind when in reality faith is the first step in what should grow to be a personal relationship with God, It is through faith we begin to receive revelation form God and through revelation we begin a personal relationship with God.|`|XN0cYCATaa	Then why are you here ?<br>  So what is "truth" ?<br>  Hmm ?<br>  <br>  If there is such a thing as truth, then we should be able to find it.  If truth cannot be known, then it probably doesn't exist.  But, it does exist.  For example, we know that it is true that you are reading this.<br>  <br>  Is there such a thing as something that is always true all the time?  Yes, there is.  For example, "Something cannot bring itself into existence."  This is an absolutely true statement.  In order for something to bring itself into existence, it would have to exist in order to be able to perform an action.  But if it already existed, then it isn't possible to bring itself into existence since it already exists.  Likewise, if it does not exist then it has no ability to perform any creative action since it doesn't exist in the first place.  Therefore, "Something cannot bring itself into existence" is an absolute truth.<br>  <br>  The preceding example is a truth found in logic.  But, there are truths that are not logical by nature.  It is true that I love my wife.  This isn't logically provable via theorems and formulas and logic paradigms, but it is, nevertheless, true.  Therefore, we can say that truth conforms and affirms reality and/or logic.<br>  <br>  Is this what relativism does?  Does relativism confirm to reality and logic?  To be honest, it does to some degree.  Relatively speaking, there is no absolute right or wrong regarding which side of your head you should part your hair, if you part it at all.  To this we must concede relative "truths" that are different for different people.  But, these are relativistic by nature.  Examples of relativistic truths are, 1) people drive on the right side of the street in America and the left in England; 2) I prefer to watch science fiction over musicals; 3) snow is better than rain, etc.  These things are relative to culture, individuals, preferences, etc., and rightfully so.<br>  <br>  If we are to ever hope to determine if there is such a thing as truth apart from cultural and personal preferences, we must acknowledge that we are then aiming to discover something greater than ourselves, something that transcends culture and individual inclinations.  To do this is to look beyond ourselves and outside of ourselves.  In essence, it means that we are looking for God.  God would be truth, the absolute and true essence of being and reality who is the author of all truth.  If you are interested in truth beyond yourself, then you must look to God.

AA10744471	How to Have Great Quiet Intimate Times with God<br>   <br>  In this article you will learn three components of a great quiet intimate time with God.<br>  <br>  Things You’ll Need:<br>  Your Bible <br>  A Prayer Journal <br>  Pen or Pencil <br>  <br>  Step1<br>  Focus on God. Everyone’s quiet time is different but one thing remains the same no matter who you are. Quiet times are all about God. There you have it the first key to quiet time is also the very purpose behind quiet time, which is to focus on God. <br>  <br>  Whether you focus on God by taking a nature walk, singing praises, or sitting quietly in your living room in a moment of reflection doesn’t really matter. What does matter is allowing time and space in your hectically over-scheduled life to make room for focusing on God. <br>  <br>  Step2<br>  Make Time for God. Taking time to make room for God is one of the best things you can do not only for yourself but for those around you. Think about it. If you are more secure in your relationship with God, your other earthly relationships will be dramatically improved as well. That leads us to the second key to a successful quiet time: Making time for God.<br>   <br>  Step3<br>  Now that you’ve gotten the first two keys down, it’s time to figure out what you do with your time for God. Let’s talk about a plan to help you organize your time with our Lord. Remember, this is not a formula because you’re in a relationship with the Lord. Relationships are ever growing, expanding and deepening. However, these guidelines can certainly get you started in your quiet time. <br>  <br>  First, start your time together with prayer. It’s a good way to clean the palette of your soul, so to speak. Try a prayer like the following: <br>  Lord, thank you for hearing me and being with me this day. Help me to focus on You and lay aside anything that would distract me from knowing you in a new way this day. Speak to me and show me what you would like me to learn from our time together. In Jesus’ name Amen. <br>  <br>  Step4<br>  Next, open your Bible and read. What you read is not what’s important. Simply open your Bible and whatever the pages fall open, start reading a few verses or a chapter. You may want to read that section one more time. Meanwhile, open your mind and ears to hear what the Lord may be trying to say to you through scripture. You might ask yourself some questions like the following: <br>  ? Is this pointing to any hidden sin I need to confess? <br>  ? Is this a godly example to follow?<br>  ? Is this a behavior I should avoid? <br>  ? How can this be applied in my life today? <br>  <br>  Step5<br>  Now, move into listening mode. What do you hear the Lord saying to you? Just relax, take a deep breathe in and exhale. You may want to close your eyes, as long as you don’t fall asleep. Think about the scripture you just read. Think about the questions about the scripture. Do you hear the Lord instructing you? Listen. <br>  <br>  Step6<br>  Lastly, you probably will want to have a pen and paper handy to write down the prompts you feel in your spirit. Remember, God gave us His Spirit in us to confirm with our own spirit when He’s talking to us. Don’t hesitate to implement what you hear the Lord leading you to do (or to stop doing).|`|AA11220299	First get your priorities right. <br>  At the top of the Christian list of priorities is righteousness. <br>  Second stay in the Bible for your understanding.<br>  Third, Pray faithfully.<br>  Fourth Wait. Spirituality comes through growth, not leaps and bounds. A child cannot see or notice his growth physically neither can you spiritually. It will take place in its time with God's help and 10 years down the road you will be able to look back and see it, but if you look ahead and try to make it happen it won't.<br>  <br>  Matthew 6:33     "But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. <br>  <br>  The biggest drawback today to young people getting to know God is the idea that I can sin and God will forgive me. It is true, but what most don't know is that there are spiritual consequences to sin in the life and God does forgive but He also diminishes potential every time you do it.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Start better habits of spending time with the Lord.  Make this a priority.  Have a plan to meditate on 1 chapter in Psalm a day and read several verses in Proverbs a day or a whole chapter.  If you are needing more wisdom, read wisdom verses.

God bless you.|`|AA10140520	By what? sins? well it's time to set them aside & live like you feel you are closer. read the Bible & start praying for a start.|`|CrZxYK5raa	go to church <br>  if you can't spend 20 minutes a day reading the bible.<br>  talk to god often!<br>  get a devotion book it will help build that relationship.<br>  make a friend who is really christian and talk to them about<br>  your choices and questions, <br>  read his word and trust him<br>  talk to him. show him your trying.|`|AA10329469	Stop struggling as you shall always be doing so without any success.Instead,be friendly with your mind and persuade it to follow a path,it shall listen and comply with.Don't forget to award it at proper intervals.|`|zhaHc4FAaa	Find a quiet place where you can reflect and pray.   Church is good for this.   I do not know what denomination you are but most catholic churches have a chapel that is a good place for reflection and prayer.  You do not need to be catholic to pray in the chapel.    It's a very quiet place to just meditate and reflect and most of them are open everyday.<br>  <br>  I have also gotten on my computer with head phones and listened to worship music or listened to prayers.   Tangle.com  is great for that.<br>  <br>  I have gone to the park and found a secluded spot and talked to God there.   I just enjoy the trees and look around and I see him in all things.   I take my bible with me and read a bit from it and I talk with him.   <br>  <br>  <br>  I have also woken up and started my day with God...right in the comfort of my bed.  I leave my bible right by my bed and I read it when I wake up.   I journal my thoughts, concerns, and I write down at least 5 things that I am grateful for.   Journaling is an excellent tool for deep connection.    I journal prayers, meditations, my fears, and the responses that God has provided for me.   <br>  <br>  These are just a few suggestions that I have. <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this works for you.<br>  <br>  Pax|`|X548yCR6aa	Try roleplaying and stuff, spice up your relationship.|`|eqsIIuydaa	Take a plane up.|`|toSMrGviaa	there's only one that became that intimate before, she gave a virgin birth?|`|KT7cllsLaa	I am as close to Ceiling Cat<br>  as it gets|`|VcM9zyikaa	ask him for help|`|tPzG9e57aa	hi! dint dump yourself. you are as close as to him . cause gods also get disturbed sometime because of our prayers. think of the one whom you like the most and rub your palms and hold you hands tightly in a dark room .. you will find a great light which will help you to do the rest of the things...|`|Qyue0Ykgaa	Fall to the ground and prostrate.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.harunyahya.com/Quran_translation/Quran_translation_index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.harunyahya.com/Quran_translat...</a>|`|iUEAS5fPaa	Pray, be a good person, stay away from wrong,help less fortunate show good deeds and always keep GOD on your mind|`|edf9fUtNaa	"Get on your knees and start praying"|`|wvGiSp3Gaa	Make sure you're in a quiet place. Pray, read your Bible, etc.|`|ewWUFWyWaa	The Bible God is a first class joker!<br>  <br>  There is no God outside of the Bible. The Jewish Bible writers put together a God story to boost the morale and to control a bunch of uneducated Hebrew shepherds living in the Palestine region! This Bible God came up to be very whimsical and unpredictable. Later on, some Greek Jews put together the New Testament to make it applicable to Jew and non-Jew Christians living elsewhere outside of Israel…  So here you have a few snapshots on this primitive God that is worshiped mostly by Christians in America!<br>  <br>  Job 9:23 (NIV) When a scourge brings sudden death, God* (*NOT SATAN, but God!) mocks the despair of the INNOCENT. <br>  <br>  Job 9:17 (NIV) He* (*God… NOT SATAN, but God!) would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds FOR NO REASON. <br>  <br>  Job 9:24 (NIV) When a land falls into the hands of the wicked* (*like the USA falling into the hands of Obama?), he* (*God) blindfolds its judges. If it is not he, then who is it*? (*Certainly not SATAN!)<br>  <br>  Lamentations 3:37-38 (infallible King James Version) Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not? OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE MOST HIGH PROCEEDETH NOT EVIL AND GOOD*? (*Preachers lie, they say that “God is GOOD”, but not firstly EVIL… read it again FIRST EVIL and then “good” as a teaser!)  <br>  <br>  Exodus 4:11 (NIV) The Lord said to him, “Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the Lord? (This Bible God loves to brag about his endeavors! How barbaric can you get?)<br>  <br>  Amos 3:6 (infallible King James Version) Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be EVIL in a city, and the lord hath not done it?* (*ALL THE EVIL IN THE WORLD COMES FROM GOD… NOT FROM SATAN…!!! Praise the LORD!!!)<br>  <br>  Proverbs 16:4 (NIV)  The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, EVEN THE WICKED FOR THE DAY OF EVIL.<br>  <br>  No primitive religion in the world is as wicked as the Bible God religion. Christians made up in their mind about what Christianity ought to be all about in spite of the overwhelming primitive barbarism describing the Bible God! Christians need to be masochistically oriented to function in this world!<br>  <br>  Ruth 1:20-21 (NIV) “Don't call me Naomi,” she told them. “Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter. I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The Lord has afflicted me; the Almighty* (*NOT SATAN, but God Almighty! PRAISE THE LORD…! Sweet Jesus! Amen?) has brought misfortune upon me.”<br>  <br>  Proverbs 1:26-28 (NIV) I* (*God NOT SATAN, but God!)  in turn will laugh at your disaster; I WILL MOCK WHEN CALAMITY OVERTAKES YOU* (*Preachers are taking advantage of any calamity like a forthcoming California Earthquake to convey a “message” from the Bible God) - when calamity overtakes you like a storm* (*please read carefully… it doesn’t say “when I send calamity!” but when it happens the SOB Bible God takes advantage of it! God is also at the mercy of the weather conditions! You need to have a very low IQ and be very dishonest to qualify as a “minister of the Word of God”!), when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you. Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they* (*God’s people) will look for me but will not find me* (* yeah, what does God have to do with all that?).<br>  <br>  There goes the “I’m with you to the end” or is it only a teaser joke? This God is real only in the clever mind of the Bible writers… <br>  <br>  Jeremiah 11: 14 "Do not pray for this people nor offer any plea or petition for them, BECAUSE I* (*God) WILL NOT LISTEN WHEN THEY CALL TO ME IN THE TIME OF THEIR DISTRESS.<br>  <br>  Nothing scares primitive religious people more than the idea that their God doesn’t listen to them! It still works today! The Christian idea that this whimsical God always listens to them is wishful hoping that the chances are just right that God will answer on the spot, or later on, or never! It is just like praying to a stick or a rock or any other more benevolent Heathen God and getting the SAME IDENTICAL RESULT!<br>  <br>  Romans 9:11-15  Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad–in order that God's purpose in election might stand: not by works but by him who calls–she was told, “The older will serve the younger.” Just as it is written: “Jacob* (*Israel) I loved, but Esau* (*Arabs) I hated.”  What then shall we say? IS GOD UNJUST? NOT AT ALL!* (*Saint Paul says so… because he is telling you he speaks for God!)  For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”* (*the Christian clergy preaches you all the opposite that God is “no respecter of persons” when the Bible writers made it clear that he very picky just for the heck of it! BTW, one of the reasons why Christians do not favor Palestinians at all unless they convert to Christianity is in this Bible story that is taught in Sunday School session not over the public media!  If the Palestinians convert to Christianity there is no guessing of what will happen. Christians favor for Israel will be put on hold! Except for Christians in America most Christians elsewhere don’t give a hoot about politics!) <br>  <br>   Malachi 1:4  (NIV) Edom* (*Esau… Arabs) may say, "Though we have been crushed, we will rebuild the ruins."  But this is what the LORD Almighty says: "They may build, but I will demolish. They will be called the Wicked Land, A PEOPLE ALWAYS UNDER THE WRATH OF THE LORD* (*How would you like to be one of them? No FREE WILL FOR YOU! NO Salvation, either! God doesn’t like you for ever just for the heck of it! AND GOD NEVER CHANGES!)<br>  <br>  Isaiah 45:7 (infallible King James Version) I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and CREATE EVIL: I the LORD* (*NOT SATAN, but God) do all these things.<br>  <br>  Job 42:11 (infallible King James Version) Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over ALL THE EVIL that the LORD* (*NOT SATAN, BUT GOD!) had brought upon him:* (*God had a plan to have ALL of Job’s children slaughtered! The heck with family love and affection…!!! Isn’t God so wonderful?! Life is so cheap in the Bible!)<br>  <br>  When was the last time that a Christian blamed God for any of his/her misfortune? They only credit Satan because that is what their favorite preachers tell them to do!  The only way that the Bible writers thought to pacify this whimsical sadistic God  was sacrificing God the Son Jesus Christ after beating him up to a pulp to be properly tenderized and thoroughly marinated in Roman soldiers’ spit for a crucifixion number totally naked as a “spotless Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world!” There is no historical record that the Roman soldiers ever dressed any of their victim’s genital area in a white diaper before hanging them on any cross! In fact, there is no record that the Romans crucified anybody in Jerusalem outside of the Bible record. The Romans were known to IMPALE their victims driving a pole into their rectum and making them stand on it until after a few days later the thick pole reach the heart or lung supporting the victim’s body weight! Jesus hardly suffered a sissy’s death hanging from a nail holding him by his hands. BTW, it is a SCIENTIFIC FACT that no human being can possibly be hanging by his/her own weight nailed to a “cross” by his/her hands! This fact alone proves the pervert mind of the Bible writers who invented Christianity! So how religiously primitive can you possibly get in our society today believing that the Roman soldiers would build a perfectly square artistically looking cross for future generation of Christians to worship?<br>  <br>  Still Christians to this day delightfully snack this Jesus Christ spit flavored Meat and drink of his Holy Blood for “salvation” in the Holy Communion so they can go to Heaven when they die (John 6:53). Europe is waking up out of the Dark Ages of Church domination and superstition far ahead of us here in America! I guess that religious gullibility will still be in effect until our IQ, common sense and self esteem improve to a decent level… Hey, are we still evolving or what?  The Bible writers were very silly to credit their idea of a God with so much EVIL when they could have done a much better job blaming the Devil all along…! They would have kept me fooled to this day, too!|`|UARQA0CLaa	You need to put God first in your life.  Schedule time first thing in the morning for devotion and prayer.  It may be that you have to get up a half hour earlier than you are accustom to but it will be worth it.  Pray throughout the day for yourself and for others who cross your path.  Spread some of your happiness to others.  Close out your day with some quiet reflection and prayer.  Make sure that you start with good habits and after awhile it will just come natural to you.

In 1442, the Incas began a far-reaching expansion under the command of Pachacutec, whose name literally means earth-shaker. He founded the Inca Empire (Tawantinsuyu), which became the largest empire in pre-Columbian America.<br>  <br>  While the Inca often tolerated or incorporated the religions of their conquered ayllus they also imposed a state religion upon them. The Inca empire was a theocracy in which the Inca king, Sapa Inca, was the descendant of Inti, the sun god. The Inca required tribute, especially before and after battle, to certain gods. Regular and general festivals punctuated the labors of the empire's subjects with food drink and entertainments. Inti Raymi, the festival of the sun god, lasted nine nights, during which Sapa Inca would provide Aqhachicha, a maize beer, to first Inti, then himself, then the nobles, and finally to all people who attended.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	Yes.

It is derived from the Middle English Christemasse and Old English Cristes m?sse, a phrase first recorded in 1038.[3] "Cristes" is from Greek Christos and "m?sse" is from Latin missa. In Greek, the letter Χ (chi), is the first letter of Christ, and it, or the similar Roman letter X, has been used as an abbreviation for Christ since the mid-16th century.[8] Hence, Xmas is often used as an abbreviation for Christmas.|`|aIakDSstaa	Mass is the Eucharistic word for celebration, the celebration of Christ.

You see, pagans used to worship the SUN, tammuz, during 'saturnalia' or the winter solstice. Christ's bday was never celebrated in the Bible. He went to christ with this pagan holiday. Thus, pagans came to worship the SUN and Christians came to worship the SON. Many Christian and Secular scholars believe that Jesus was born in September, closer to the Jewish feast of tabernacles, which perfectly aligns with Gods plan. Now, its a total abomination, for God to see that "His people" put up trees, decorate them, celebrate everything else that is pagan, but not Him. Ever read Jeremiah 10:3-5? Where it talks about christmas trees? If the bible doesnt say to celebrate Christ's Bday, then why would we go as far as adopting pagan traditions into celebrating it? I think He would be appalled at what is going on with the churches today, and many "Christian" beliefs...its time we get back to the word of God.

There Jehovah was unknown: entirely so by the Egyptians, largely so by the Israelites. The favored descendants of Abraham had sunk as low as the heathen in whose midst they dwelt, and God, by so many remarkable signs and unmistakable interventions, brought them back to that knowledge of Himself which they had lost. Unless the Hebrews in Egypt had been thoroughly convinced by these displays of divine power that Moses was a prophet sent from God, they never would have submitted to him as their leader. How reluctantly they owned his authority on various occasions! So also in the conquest of Canaan, God wrought four miracles in favor of His people: one in the water, in the crossing of Jordan; one in the earth, in throwing down the walls of Jericho; one in the air, in destroying their enemies by hail; and one in the heavens, by slowing the course of the sun and the moon. Thereby the nations of Canaan were furnished with clear proof of Jehovah’s supremacy, that the God of Israel possessed universal dominion, that He was no local deity but the Most High reigning over all nature.|`|CuN7dCi2aa	elisha is a bald lil f*ck who cries when lil children make fun of him

That is, the juvenile justice system aims to convert young criminals into non-criminals.  So, trying a little harder might help.<br>  But often teens are tried as adults, which is often fitting.  In many cases, crimes get pushed down to teens or younger people, because it is known that those people will receive more lenient sentences.  Erasing the difference helps protect teens from being used in such ways.  <br>  Also, a major part of the adult prison system is that those bad people are kept away from ordinary society, so they cannot hurt the rest of us.  This is also true of teens.  If teen criminals are kept away from other teens, it makes life better for those other teens.

First of all if your talking about attraction everyone has a type. Sometimes all people are suprised when a guy or girl comes along that they wouldn't normally go for but they do find themselves attracted to them. Generally there have been studies that shows people tend to go for people with similar features to them selves. This doesn't aply to everyone. but You have to accept that people do have types at that's it. It's not personal or anything. For example, I generally am attracted to Spanish & Brazilian guys, but it doesn't mean I'm writing off being attracted to someone from Asia. You fancy who you fancy regardless of where they are from.

wxBFZ41Taa	The ashes come from the burned palm leaves from the previous Palm Sunday. <br>  <br>  The priest makes the sign of the cross, in ashes, on your forehead and says "remember that you are dust and to dust you shall return" or " turn from sin and follow the Gospel." <br>  <br>  The idea of ashes has to do with penance. Sinners used to put on sackcloth and ashes as a sign of deep repentance and humility. <br>  <br>  Ash Wednesday is the beginning of the 40 days before Easter. Just as we use the Advent season to prepare for the birth of Christ, so we use the Lenten season to prepare for the death and resurrection of Christ. <br>  <br>  To those who say silly things like "it's not biblical" miss the point and limit God and their ability to know him. <br>  <br>  No where does the Bible say that we are limited to doing only Biblical practices to deepen our relationship with God. The Catholic Church has never said that Lent is a biblical practice, nor does it have to be. Altar calls, tent revivals, and Bible studies are not mentioned in the Bible either, but many Christians participate in these practices.|`|791369017fd575cf3f0e23a2ea22a6a3aa	Like the other answers say the ashes are burned palms turned into ashes.

(Daniel 9:3)<br>  <br>  "When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, laid aside his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in the ashes." (Jonah 3:6)<br>  <br>  "And all the Israelite men, women and children who lived in Jerusalem prostrated themselves in front of the temple building, with ashes strewn on their heads, displaying their sackcloth covering before the Lord." (Judith 4:11; see also 4:15 and 9:1)<br>  <br>  "That day they fasted and wore sackcloth; they sprinkled ashes on their heads and tore their clothes." (1 Maccabees 3:47; see also 4:39)<br>  <br>  Jesus refers to the use of sackcloth and ashes as signs of repentance: "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty deeds done in your midst had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes." (Matthew 11:21, Luke 10:13)<br>  <br>  ? Ash Wednesday ? <br>  <br>  As the beginning of Lent, Ash Wednesday calls us to the conversion journey that marks the season. <br>  <br>  As those preparing to join the Church enter the final stage of their preparation for the Easter sacraments, we are all called to walk with them so that we will be prepared to renew our baptismal promises when Easter arrives.<br>  <br>  When we receive ashes on our foreheads, we remember:<br>  ?

When  you  receive  the  Ashes  it  is  to  remind  us  that  our  bodies   have  come  from  ashes  and  will  return  to  ashes.

They are placed on our foreheads to remind us that we are mortal (from ash we came and unto ash we shall return), and to remind us that we are sinful and in need of change in our lives. We use the season of Lent to focus on this more of which Ash Wednesday is the beginning.

Oh, and by the way, if she is putting out her laundry in the backyard, she is considered 'trailer trash" here!  Good luck!|`|FLAtdWrmaa	Oh, good grief, this lady has problems way beyond you and your family.  Try not to take her rudeness personally.  Avoid her as much as possible, don't answer her but don't run away if she tries to make trouble for you or your kids.  Keep any yard gates firmly closed so her dog doesn't become an issue any more.  When you do have to talk with her, keep your voice calm and firm at all times -- show your emotions if you must (anger, fear for your kids, frustration, etc), but keep it low-key.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't try too hard to "make her happy."  If she has another problem, ask her what *she* intends to do to solve it.  She's likely to take *your* conciliatory efforts as nothing more than guilt on your part, proving (to herself, at least) that her complaints are real and her behaviour justified.<br>  <br>  I'll tell you a story from my family, maybe it can help you deal with this very odd woman.  My grandmother, whom I loved dearly and still miss (she passed away many years ago), lived for most of her adult life in the same house in a large city, never moving to her newer place until my grandfather had been retired for some years.  Her very narrow side yard had a similar sort of low, light fence along it; the next-door neighbours had their driveway right along the fence, paved in solid concrete, with their house wall alongside that.  The elder lady who lived in that house retired to a nursing home, and sold the house to a family with primary-school-aged kids.  My grandmother was in her late 50s.  <br>  <br>  From the day the family moved in, my grandmother had no end of complaints about them.  The kids played ball on the driveway and the bouncing and noises echoed horribly, they and their friends yelled and screamed every time she tried to take a little nap, they sassed her with disrespect all the time, they threw their trash into her yard all the time, they bothered my grandmother's cats constantly, the whole family were up and around at all hours, the father banged the trash cans at 6 am on collection days, their barbecues in the backyard went on till all sorts of inconsiderate hours, .... the litany of wrongs went on and on.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, my grandmother never did anything to provoke any of this herself, she was always the injured party, completely innocent.  The muttered comments and sour looks she cast their way didn't really happen.<br>  <br>  I lived with my grandparents for a while, and oddly enough, I rarely saw or heard any of what angered my grandmother so much.  My grandfather said the same, he just bore with her groundless complaints.  The family was, after all that, just an ordinary city family living cheek-by-jowl with everyone else, with healthy and active kids;  and none of them were really badly behaved.<br>  <br>  The only explanations my family have, now, were that a), my grandmother had a lifetime history of depression, in the decades when diagnosis was shameful, and treatment was very uncommon and not very effective;  b)  she'd grown up in the country all of her childhood, and only moved into any city as an adult, when she needed to find work, and maybe never really adjusted to the bustle and the noise;  and c) my grandmother had been severely abused as a child by her family, mother, father, and "extendeds", and had lost all trust in people:  she never, ever assumed that anyone meant her well -- or even regarded her with indifference.  Just the opposite was true, in her mind:  even minor annoyances were caused by somebody's malevolence towards her.  Does this sound like your neighbour at all?<br>  <br>  Within the family, she was much milder and gentler, especially with her grandchildren.  But there was never a time that her own children had ever known her NOT to have problems with her neighbours.|`|PGCKZl1Laa	What do you expect she is old! no offense but they have no hobby  so they decide to be difficult cause they can get away with it.

You have been more than fair, and really you have gone out of your way in your consideration for your inconsiderate neighbor.  You should be very proud of the way you handled things.  You have taught your children a valuable lesson about taking the high road in life.  There are people in this world who are happier being unhappy, who are in fact happier when they have something to complain about.  So essentially you have done her a favor by giving her something to complain about!  Continue being cordial to her, and just move on.

AA10858522	Yes , they are and the average opinion of the not informed American is that they are serving some sort of divine purpose, that gets non-jews into heaven for helping the people god actually likes. But the instability that Israel causes in the region with American military aid and $8Billion a year in free financial aid makes it easier to pull the strings of the surrounding governments. But seriously Israel causes lots of problems and the primary cause of the Intafada was the Israeli occupation and purge of the land of Palestine(for the uninformed Israel was created in the UN not the Bible) Crime and terrorism is caused by hopelessness and poverty. A terrorist is just someone who is opposed to the ruling powers of government when they take up arms to attack or defend themselves. I disagree with the rocket attacks but i have lived in the middle east and seen both sides. Saying that everybody in the middle east who doesn't look white is crazy is nonsense. Humanity is Humanity.

Oh and the fact that Israel is the only functioning democracy in the region makes a big difference.<br>  <br>  If the Arabs want fair dealing maybe they could start with their own populations.  It's the Arab countries that have declared war on Israel and denied them recognition.  The arab countries that have left the Palestinians as a stateless people, especially Jordan and Egypt.<br>  <br>  The US's attitude isn't the problem here it's the dictatorships in Arab countries using Israel as a way of uniting people and directing their hatred at someone other than the rulers themselves.

So the Palestinians and the Jew are fighting to this land which has ties to their religious background.

We focus on confronting the problems in society, and being a strong force in the community.  We are about high scholastic achievement and giving back to our ever changing community.  So I advise you before you approach any AKA have your sh*t together because they and we are about so much more than the pettiness of weight and looks.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	I was hall council president of a sorority dorm and they were all fat so I really think you're friend is being closed minded.

In some schools, AKA's are extremely superficial.  Appearance is everything to them.  It stems from the foundation of the classes of African Americans in this country when these organiztions began.  The richer, more affluent black community were one class, while the average working joe was another.
TjrnVFVRaa	Ghosts are in actuality restless spirits who have passed on to the next plane of existence. Sometimes a spirit may still have some unfinished business in this world and they then cannot complete the journey to the next step of this wonderful transition. <br>  <br>  When they attempt to seek help to complete whatever matter that needs attention, they will try to contact us for help. This manifestation by the restless spirit is often misinterpreted as a haunting by a ghost, and is the subject of folklore.  <br>  <br>  Do not fear a spirit that is trying to contact you, in general they mean no harm, and if you can help them with a simple task that harms no one, then what a great favor you can do, and remember, someday you too may need this same type of help!|`|TGu0LTQTaa	Yes. There are departed soul. When a person dies, the soul leave the body. Due to undone business on earth, they may have refuse to move to another dimension. This perhaps either they did not realise the they are dead or they have die sudden, horribly or being done unfair such as raped and murder. It is also believe in Taoism, when a person dies in an accident, he/she have to find a replacement to take over his/her place so that he/she can be reborn in a traffic accident. That is when a place has an traffic accident, the place become unclean and more accident happens. There are people who are born with the third eye that can see ghost, evil spirit and devil. Some believe that animals can see ghosts. It is also believe that if we rub the eyes of the dog and rub you eyes with its tears you may see ghost. Make sure don't take the risk to try. You may regret it and may have the eyes dug out so you won't see them again.|`|2yUQiKlvaa	Well to be honest this depends on what a person believes. One may believe they are real if they have seen one or experieneced one. Others still may believe but have not actually seen or expierenced one.

But there are a million and one people who would disagree with me on that.<br>  <br>  I believe in stone tape theory, in which a place or a building retains echoes of the past and when the conditions are right, those echoes are replayed.

Here in Belgium, after learning a second language from 4th or 5th grade on, we learn a third and fourth language from 10th grade on.

You just have to regularly maintain the languages you learn at a later age.|`|63c29d0e010c46bcc8d52695123cb4beaa	No, it's not too late.

You're just 16, not 80 ^_^ !!<br>  Even if the "scientific" age to learn a now langua as native is (about) 8/10 years (when the mind is still growing up and is reactive to new knowledges) is not hard to learn a now language at your age, it all depends on the dedication, and if you work hard you could be a very good fluent-speaker (maybe not a native, but fluent is a good result!!).<br>  Personally in my school we learn English from since we're 6 years old, Latin and Classical Greek when we're 14..with good results!|`|hWH4vKoBaa	It's never late to learn.

When I met my husband he did not know much English and I got a book to learn Spanish and I do pretty good as long as  they don't talk too fast. His English is better now too. School teaches kids to read more than they do to have a conversation. You'll do great.|`|k3iAFzDMaa	you know learn a language when we are children is easier because you learn both languages at the same time,but when you are older is more difficult,by the way it is always a challenge for yourself,you can try...<br>  for example i am 17 years old and i am learning japanese BY MYSELF...i am going crazy but i am improve a lot : P<br>  whatever at fist you can be consused because you confuse the language each other but with time thinghs will go ok...especially if you go abroad,this will improve a lot your knowledge... <br>  (sorry for any grammatical errors i am not english)

nF7g8nphaa	Lucky Day<br>  Found a Psychic in Mythology and Folklore!<br>  <br>  a) What happens when I meet a girl for the first time?<br>  Or <br>  b) What happened when I met that girl for the first time?<br>  <br>  a) When you meet a girl for the first time you will tell her your name; when she tells you her name you will say it is a nice name, you will give her a gentle compliment. You will mention something you are interested in- mention it briefly- and she will respond. Ask her to tell you about something she has enjoyed doing recently or what are some of her interests or talents. Don't talk the whole time- it will bore her. Really listen when she speaks. Look at her eyes but don't stare- look away once in awhile or you come across as too intense. <br>  Okay that was basic social psychology advise.<br>  <br>  b) This is the question you are really asking. <br>  What happened? when I met the girl for the first time? why are things going this way (a way you don't want them to go) now?<br>  <br>  You didn't do all the things I listed above. You bored her. You made some comments she found rude. If her parents were present they disapproved.<br>  If you want another chance with this girl you must.<br>  1) send her flowers with a note saying "I would like to get to know you better, will you meet me again?" If you know you did something wrong add "I apologize for _____ and ask you to accept my apology."<br>  2) If you get to meet her again, do everything listed in a) above.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	speak english!!!|`|9qsTvmSKaa	Um, it depends on how you feel about her, if that's what you mean.

3E2EQH12aa	err.. my understanding of common law marriage is that 2 people who actually are NOT married are only considered that way for legal purposes and insurance purposes etc, after having been together for a certain number of years. there is nothing islamic about this...there is no halal "together" without marriage.|`|U5zcbHuZaa	A strange question since all Muslim marriages in my state would be called common-law marriages (though my state does not actually recognize such marraiges).. A nikkah at the Sunni mosque is not a legal marriage in my state and has no more standing as a legal marriage in my state than a Shia marriage without doing anything at mosque.<br>  <br>  Marriage is about the two people involved. What does "common-law" mean anyhow? Allah's laws are the common laws we all share. I'm fine with a common-law marriage then, because we don't need the approval of the state or of authoritarians running the mosque to be married, we only need Allah's approval -- we only need to follow the laws Allah made common for all humanity, and I can find nothing so far in Qur'an that requires approval of others in the ummah, of the imam, or of the state.<br>  <br>  Putting such conditions of approval upon marriage is to go against Allah, for it makes unlawful what Allah has made lawful and it forces people to sometimes have to navigate religious politics to get married, and Allah does not require that for a couple to love one another properly and be proper marriage partners. A dower to the woman is mentioned in Qur'an, but not a nikkah (I can't find it, anyone have a Qur'an verse requiring nikkah?).|`|ILc1XIPraa	You asked this yesterday.

People who do what your question asks are the ones who are generally jealous of & envy those they don't like for one reason or another. They usually buy something of better or higher priced than what the people they don't like have. Jealousy & envy are extremely dangerous in many ways. God has told us a lot about jealousy & envy in His Word. We must keep our thoughts & feelings in check & focus on God's Word because those 2 ugly heads can arise @ any given opportunity.

vwFf2ftcaa	MashaAllaah love Pedram's answer:-)    Anita if you read his biography also known as seerah in Arabic you a non muslim will began to love him for who he was.  He cared for the orphans and fought for the defenseless throughout his life even before his Prophet-hood. He was known for his truthfulness, his enemies didn't dare deny his pure character, he was always humble and lived a simple life. When He(saw) became a Prophet his mild manners and righteous-self started to shine forever more.  Muhammad(saw) was so humble that when strangers come to see him they where not able to recognize him until he was pointed out, he used to sit with his companions just like a fellow companion never arrogant always bashful.  His life was simple, he used to sleep in leaves put together by a rope, Once a few of his disciples, noticing the imprint of his mattress on his body, wished to give him a softer bed but he politely declined the offer saying,   "What have I to do with worldly things. My connection with the world is like that of a traveler resting for a while underneath the shade of a tree and then moving on."   He loved his companions so dearly, when they traveled together they used to share the rides, he(saw) always shared a ride with one of his companions, he would ride for a while, while the other companion guided the camel, when it was the other companions turn the Prophet(saw) would lead the camel while his companion rested.  The feelings we have for him are overwhelming, there is no way to describe it. We love him more than ourwnselves let alone our families.  It is the simplicity of his life and his loyalty to God that stands out for me.    Yes we say he was perfect in character but he was a human being he was guided by God and was corrected few times in the holy Qur'aan, he(saw) used to consult his companions too and he would change his ideas if theirs was better than his. I do not believe he was infallible, only God is perfect. This is my believe this is the strongest opinion in this matter.    edit: But Hunny bunny of course our views are baised we are those who answered his call(not technically those who answered his call where his generation) but we are those who follow his footsteps and say we hear and obey. You ask us to tell you our thoughts of him, our feelings towards him and that is exactly what we did...... :)  peace n luv.|`|v8ZBBU3Raa	Respect yourself and respect your neighbors!|`|AA10147081	we as Muslims love Prophet Mohamed peace be upon him because he started that love for us.. he did every thing he could just to resque us from the illitreturity..if you take a look at what all he did, you will definitly know he never ask for anything for him..Prophet Mohamed didn't ask us to worship him..he just wanted us to follow his path which leads to Allah's satisfactions which will ends to the paradise..  he is like a teacher who wants his students to get a good grades and he is not asking for any rewards..  after all that you don't think he desearve Muslims's love!!|`|5ofS2qQYaa	perfect describes human concepts, Allah(swt) cannot be described by human concepts, cannot be imagined by the human mind  :)    For the Prophet(sws), I have the highest respect and the greatest love for the man that he was and the kind of example he made for the rest of mankind! Who does not want to be like the most perfect human being? He was human, yes, but the MOST Perfect of all. There were mistakes, but even those were perfected by himself by the will of Allah(swt). We know how to deal w/mistakes and life b/c of his example    "many flaws"? by whose standards?  even non-muslims of his time would flock to him and revere him.  even non-muslims of our time revert everyday to be like him.    only new opinions brought on by hatred and selfishness of those who do not want others to see the whole picture label him as one w/"many flaws"  I'm not accusing you of that...I'm just saying, please check your sources for biases (check both sides + the whole context) and keep learning about as much as you can in regards to Islam and the Prophet(sws)    :)    Allah(swt) knows best|`|c9a0e0fe028dd12522725bdd1112da48aa	I think for me personally, he brings out patience and kindness.

When ever im in an awkward situation i think 'what would muhammed (s.a.w) do..and i do it'. I know im not in his high standard (ofcourse) but i stilll try to attempt to be like him. To do my best. In consideration to emations, i think i often feel imense respect for our prophet, for all he did, but i ofen feel upset to. I don't know why, but i often do, maybe because he had to suffer quite a bit in his life. but yes, love for him aswel, i love reading about him. It fills me with pide to know im a muslim and a follower of him. I do love him....yet i know my love can go beyond. Forgive me anyone if i do sound bad....but i don't think i've ever said i love him more than my family. Probably on the same level...But yes..i have a long way to go..thats why as a muslim i attempt to know our prophet by reading and learning about him more and more and to implement his way in our lives so that the love i have for him increases day by day.

I'll use them when I have kids.<br>  <br>  What my mom did with us was she would put pocket change around the house so when we would dust or help her clean the kitchen or bathroom we would get a little bonus to our allowance. Worked great!!!<br>  <br>  When we got older she had a list of extra chores that we would get like a $1 or two extra if we did them to her expectation. (Or if we really wanted something at the store or wanted our mom's famous cookies (she would have us help of course).) In time we just got in the habit of doing them. We didn't even ask for the money after a while. Especially when we got our own little jobs in the summer.  <br>  <br>  I was a little different from my brothers. I love to cook even when I was a little kid. So, if I did my chores plus a little extra my mom would let me pick out something I wanted to make and we would make it together. That's where I learned to cook from scratch and clean up after myself in the kitchen. I just carried that habit to my room and later my bathroom (I preferred this method over the other one when it came to doing my chores)<br>  <br>  Don't know if you want to go that route I personally like some of the other answers better but that is what my mom did for us. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps someone!!!|`|V0287T2Vaa	Lead by example, and get younger childrent to help with chores to get them into the tidiness habit when they're small.|`|jnAAKCjHaa	Keep a clean home and clean children.|`|sXnoIFRsaa	this has worked for me and many of my friends.<br>  when you have the kids gone for the day, take the time to make the house spotless, make the place shine and show that you really made a super effort to clean the house.

When your Kids arrive home stop them at the front door and explain to them I want you to see right now how Happy Mommy is then show them how lovely the house looks and explain that a happy Mom is a pleasant Mom and then explain to them about the photos and how each time they leave that room to take a look at the photo and if it looks like that when they leave Mom is happy.<br>  Works for me all the time!

9BeUbORtaa	Of these verses, the only ones that unambiguously refer to same-sex contact are the Levitical laws, which Christians (and most Jews) no longer view as binding upon them. The Levitical laws probably worked fine in the seventh century BC, but today, we no longer observe the Jewish purity code. Indeed, St Paul goes to great lengths to insist that the purity code is no longer valid. That is why most of us don't mind eating oysters, or wearing cotton-blend clothes.     In Romans, Paul is referring to pagan temple-worship. He clearly doesn't think highly of same-sex contact, and views it as symptomatic of paganism, which is his main target. We need not necessarily share his view that homosexuality is indexical of pagan nature-worship.

I'm also a linguist and author. The two verses in Leviticus are mistranslated from Hebrew. They are not about homosexuality. In Hebrew they refer to two men lying down in a woman's bed. Like Lev. 15, these verses deal with the proper use of a woman's bed.  As for Jude, it goes back to Gen. 19 and the notion that Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed for homosexuality. Neither the Hebrew text of Genesis nor any of the ancient Jewish commentaries on Sodom suggest such a thing, nor does Ezekiel, in his list of Sodom's sins. So where did the notion come from? The Koran. It first suggested such a thing, and Europeans adopted the notion and incorporated it into later translations of the Bible. In Greek, Jude does not say "strange flesh, " but rather, "other flesh." The word for flesh is also the word for meat, and may be a reference to cannibalism, which did exist in the area of Sodom. Fornication is ANY sex outside of marriage. Sodom was known to participate in temple prostitution, which was a form of worship to a fertility goddess. Because of the connection with fertility, temple prostitution was always heterosexual.

I know this is who I am, and I hate the fact that it seems as if I must choose between my religion and being true to myself.    Edit: Okay..thumbs down me. That's the way I feel..you have your opinion and I have mine. Thanks.

My aunt is psychic and I have seen her intuitions be true many times.  Is it coincidence that she called me asking if my sister was okay the minute I heard from my sister who was in trouble, i think not!  Nor was it a coincidence that she always knew what was going on in my life.  Call it intuition or call it psychic ability, either way it's extraordinary.  If you have the gift you should explore it!

4e0EmSEgaa	God does not have a conscience. The Human conscience is a side effect of having a human brain. God does not have a human Brain. I would say in general, there are probably few if any human concepts of psychology which apply to him. Now if you're talking about Jesus on Earth there may be some things we could speculate about but that's an entirely different subject.<br>  <br>  Additionally, in Abrahamic theology (Judaism, Christianity, Islam), God is the authority.

I took up trumpet in the 6th grade and played through high school. Played trumpet throughout the western states both in competition and in concert. Local colleges hired me to set in with their orchestras for concerts. I played an old Bach Stradivarius trumpet that was completely hand built in France and a mouthpiece that was custom built for me by Erving R. Bush, who was then first trumpet in the Hollywood philharmonic. While still in high school I took music classes at BYU, who has one of the best fine arts centers in the nation. Upon graduation from high school, they offered me a full four year scholarship that included tuition, books, housing and all. I was offered several other scholarships as well. I was considered one of the best amateur trumpet players in the west. Now I haven't played for years.|`|vOYyFqxRaa	My parents got an old piano which was never tuned and had a broken key. I wanted to take piano lessons and we hired a lady who lived up the street. She gave me 3 lessons and informed my parents that they were wasting their money. That hurt even though it was true. I got a piano years later and my daughter kind of learned to play.|`|fc61095727fe8a17ac058f0c1b8e3bf2aa	My mother made me take piano lessons. I asked to stop for my 8th grade graduation present. I hated that the instructor would only let me play classical. I didnt play for years but when my parents moved into an apartment from their house, I brought the piano home with me. It needs some tuning but I can still remember some of the things I learned. As for entertaining at parties, I'm not that good.|`|W8bs2VQSaa	My mother made me take piano lessons. The guy turned out ot be pedophile. When I figured out what he was doing, I quit. And I was the one who got into trouble...go figure. And they called the 50's "the good old days "! <br>  <br>  I've never ( for obvious reasons)  played the piano since then. I wish I'd had a decent teacher, because I actually liked it. Maybe....maybe its not too late. A little electronic piano with a "mute" function, a good teacher, and maybe after 50 years it might not be too late.|`|7fHsyHYraa	I played the trombone in the band during my Junior High School years.  Mom insisted that I join the band but I much preferred playing sports.  I also learned to play some basic chords on the guitar when I was a teenager.  I could keep up with songs like "House of The Rising Sun" or "Where Have All the Flowers Gone" but not anything faster.  Haven't played the guitar in 40 years.  Wonder if I could still do it?  I just might have to try.|`|AA11991883	I wanted to learn the guitar(it was groovy) so mom indulged me with lessons.

I love music but just don't have what it takes to make music.  I taught myself guitar because everyone wanted to be a folksinger.  And in college I took up flute because I always thought it made a wonderful sound but, honestly, a computer with no emotion or thought could play better than me.  I did learn how to be a great air guitar and air piano and air flute and air bass.  From time to time I still play my air instruments (and have augmented my band with a dynomite drummer and sax player).|`|Dmaahsc3aa	I come from a family of musicians........Some still play in bands today !<br>  I, myself, can play the clarinet and alto sax, but I gave both my instruments to children who wanted to learn but could not afford to buy them. . . As a young adult I picked up the ukulele and played at hootenanny's. . . remember them ? ? It was so much fun !!  I also had a blind uncle who played professionally, here in Cincinnati, piano and organ (George Coorey).  My daughter played the flute for 6 years in school, and my son played french horn, drums and guitar.......so, you see, we are all musically inclined. . . it is just that none of us could ever sing and carry a tune in a bucket !!|`|GrKiEDb1aa	The summer between 3rd/4th grades my grandparents got me to take accordian lessons.  From that, I learned about the keyboard and learned to play song (by ear) on the piano.  I also played flute in 4th grade (we all did), but I played songs we didn't do in school, too.  In 7th grade, my grandmother bought me a clarinet which I had from 1959 until it was stolen during a break-in in our apt. bldg storage room in 79.  In high school, while I played clarinet, I found my nich in the drum section and was the tympani player (kettle drums) for our concerts.  While in Viet Nam (1966 & 1967) I started learning to play guitar. I even had a country band 1972 -73 in Antarctica, the McMurdo Country Sound.  We billed ourselves as the BEST BAND ON THE CONTINENT.  Sadly, recently my lead guitarist, Bud, and my drummer, Rick, have passed away.  I also play autoharp, sax, drums.<br>  I tried to learn to play the oboe (similar to a clarinet but it has a double reed), but the reeds were to expensive as I kept splitting them.   I always wanted to learn to play the fiddle. Friend of mine taught me some basics on the banjo many years ago.  Another friend taught me some on the 'slap bass.'|`|AA11296212	The only instrument I can play is the triangle.|`|dXrHoLMCaa	in the school orchestra and band....

While stationed in Germany, helped form and play in a Country-Western band.  Only instrument I still play is the guitar.  In retrospect, I do wish I had learned how to play the  piano.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	In High School, my singing voice was my musical instrument. I was part of the trio that sang at special school events.

After my recovery from the broken jaws, <br>  I found I could no longer carry a tune and instead of being a soprano, I now was an alto, nearly a bass.

We're had some wonderful vacations in these 6 years. The absolute standout was last year when we spent a month in Egypt....wow, wow, wow...what a magic place, immersing ourselves in a culture so different from our own, and seeing for ourselves the majesty of the ancient Egyptian culture, history and art. Cruising down the Nile, watching children leaping and splashing in the water, watching the women washing their clothes in the Nile, a farmer washing his cattle, and the haunting sounds of the mullahs calling the faithful to prayer...what an evocative place. I'd go back in a minute.|`|aEeCCHVlaa	Living in Florida, our usual vacation would be to visit relatives up North. Being the type of person who likes to keep busy doing things, the vacation was one of repairing/fixing things most of the time.The one vacation that was most special was when we asked our youngest daughter what she wanted for her 10th birthday (1976).  She wanted to go to Key West, so I took my leave time and we went to Key West, after which we toured the State of Florida. No repair work, just being with and enjoying  my family, Being military and stationed all over, we figured there would always be time to see attractions - wrong!  It seemed time went by very quickly and then it was relocate.  I was 42 at the time, had my wife and 3 children.

A blend of modern and ancient, French-style bakeries and cafes everywhere, even villages. Masses of tv satellite dishes everywhere even on little shanty houses. Donkey carts carrying computers, tvs, cases of coca-cola. Whole families riding motorcycles, Mercedes taxis, double-deck trucks with cows on the top level. Very colorful place, unbelievable hospitality and wonderful food at all levels of society.  I visited a village, a blad (rural cluster of houses with sheeps and cows), Casablanca, the capitol city of Rabat, touristy Marrakech, went to the mountains, the ocean, and wheat fields. I spent my 50th birthday in Morocco, went on whim (why not I wanted to travel) and fell in love with it.|`|vQJPRjhVaa	I was able to travel to europe from Denver at age 30.

We went scuba diving and saw the beautiful coral reefs and those "sea urgents" and pretty fish in crystal clear water. We went sight seeing, shopping, dining in very nice resturants and stayed at really unique inns and hotels in town or at the beach. It was very relaxing and fun.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	In 2001, my daughter and I went to Plymouth, Mass for a few days so she could meet a girl she'd been emailing with for some time. We also went to Salem, and learned why they had those witch trials.<br>  <br>  Other than those 2 preplanned destinations, we simply got up and left whatever motel we'd found the night before.  Left at least by checkout time, sometimes earlier.  Pointed the car in a direction, and drove.  Somewhere.  Anywhere.  It didn't matter where. <br>  <br>  It was autumn, and we left the interstate highways when we could. Traveled the back roads.  Saw farms, small towns, and the glorious colors in the trees.  Stopped when we saw something we wanted to take more time with.  Stopped at motels that had a great view, or interesting things nearby, or simply whenever we decided we'd driven far enough for that day. Walked along beaches of the East Coast oceanside. <br>  <br>  I was 60, daughter was 40.  It was 2 years before I retired.  Both daughter and I found joy in having 2 weeks of nonstructured time.  Freedom.  Go anywhere.  See what's out there.<br>  <br>  Most of the other vacations I've gone on, were destination ones, going to see my Mother In Law (who didn't really like me,).

One week we took off for the southern end of the island (6 hour drive).  We took our time going down and camped over night on 'mesa' over looking a huge valley.  In the morning I heard a 3 wheeled truck and stepped out to meet it.  I asked who owned the land and the driver said he did. I asked how much I owed him for camping over night.  He said nothing, just that we make sure to pick up any trash.  We always do.  When we got to the southern tip, we camped near the beach in a small forest with many other Sardinians, Italians, and continentals.  We met so many folks and had such a good time, my wife and 2 sons.  After we got our tent up, I tied a small American flag to the center pole.  That got a lot of folks stopping by to meet the Americans.  It was 'rough' camping....no showers, no toilets, no snack bars.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	caribbean|`|Dmaahsc3aa	When I was a child, every summer vacation was spent at a camp house we owned on the Little Miami River just about 20 miles away.

Back then when I was younger we almost lived there. We swan in the ocean and was never afraid of sharks.

What if John 3:16 was a mistake or completely made up? Would this not undermine the validity of the entire Christian faith?<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, as it happens, the Bible is replete with errors and mistranslations and so any genuine message has long since been altered and it is guesswork to try to address what is real and what is made up.

The discussion of contradictions and translations isn't just a waste of time; they make the message of the Bible much clearer than ever. There can't be a fully accurate Bible translation; only accurate meaning. The word of God isn't letters printed on paper by ink; nor it is the sound of spoken words. The word of God are the thoughts and ideas conveyed by the printed words in the Bible and/or spoken words when read from the Bible. As in anything else, like in Bible translations, accuracy is always important as far as it could be had. Accuracy in translation will thus minimize, if not reconcile, seeming contradictions.|`|gGmMw2vDaa	I agree. It is a waste to discuss all of the contradictions in the bible under the guise that these fairy tales might actually have any truth to them.|`|o4UrRbTvaa	Because when you call the Bible "infallible" and the actual "Word of God", than that refers to the entire book, not just parts of it.  Either all is accurate or all is not. You either believe it all, or none. When the Bible is used to justify itself, it must either ALL be the "Word of God" or ALL not. You can't pick and choose which you believe and which parts you do not.  Contradictions prove how inaccurate it really is and therefore makes it impossible to be the "Word of God".|`|NLinPsyhaa	You have no understanding of the Word. Word, when capitalized means Christ.

Christianity is the religion of the "Word" of God, a word which is "not a written and mute word, but the Word which is incarnate and living".

7ufheV16aa	I am a Catholic, and, while I can't really explain a whole lot of the Catholic faith, it is the true religion instituted by Jesus before Protestantism, which came hundreds of years later by Martin Luther and other reformers. If you read the history of the Catholic Church, you will see that it is the one true church of Christ, despite some of its errors. I can also say that we don't believe that you go to Hell if you don't believe in Jesus as your Lord and Savior. I believe that God is a just and loving God who judges people on what they know about him and on what good things they did in their lives (ex. giving to charity, helping the sick, etc). There is a quote in the Bible (I think it is from the book of James) which states "faith without works is dead" which clearly explains that faith alone isn't sufficient enough to get you to Heaven. The Catholic Church also teaches that if someone who dies with unrepentant mortal sin (three conditions to committ mortal sin: it needs to be serious, you need to have knowledge of what you're doing is a sin, and you need to committ the sin even though you already know it is wrong; if you do all these three things, then your sin is mortal) in their soul, they will go to Hell for eternity. Mortal sin is a grave offense against God that seperates you completely from Him. If you die with venia sin in your soul, then you will go to Purgatory to be cleansed (or purged) from your sins and be made pure. Purgatory is a  non-eternal place for souls who yearn for God, but still fall in some sin. They lack the fullness of God's grace. Souls who have no sin at all go to Heaven. I'm not sure if I stated this all correctly, so you may want to check out the Catholic Catechsim (online, if you don't have the book), which explains many issues such as sin, Purgatory, veneration of Mary, etc. There might be an index in the book where you can easily find what you're looking for. In the Catholic Bible, there are footnotes under or at the side of some passages which explain what the passages mean. If you decide to convert to Catholicism, check out the Tridentine Latin Mass, which used to be the regular form of Mass that was celebrated before Vatican II. 2 or 3 yrs ago, Pope Benedict brought back the Latin Mass, so now anyone can attend it. It is truly beautiful way of worshipping the Lord; it is also more reverant and prayerful than today's 1-hour Mass, which is slowly adding some Protestant service parts to the Mass. Hopefully this helps, and I hope that you find your true place and hope in the Catholic Church!|`|3rdXOSLVaa	If you want to hold on to your belief in christ, then try UU.

They record it in "Field service report' and this report is reflected in their annual magazines. <br>  Guys remember: The FSR is mandatory, rain or shine, even below 0.|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	I made one cry once.

I just don't know if I believe it.|`|WVPYem5Vaa	I just tell them that I am not interested. If they persuade, I step back and start to swing the door shut.

Serve them only fresh spring water in clean glasses while subtly leading them over to the hidden pit. <br>  Preparations: Make sure to have hinges cleaned and oiled regularly or you could have an embarrassing situation on your hands. Always keep a LOT of paper towels on hand, save the excessive garments for Mormon recycling drives.. <br>  A well dug pit is worth the money, you really do get what you pay for. Oh, and make sure you have plenty of ear-plugs ready, sometimes it can be difficult to sleep through the weeping. Be firm, tell it to spread the lotion on its skin, and walk away –oh, and don’t keep Dogs nearby|`|MI53mUKzaa	we don't have any where i live now but i can remember being a child in New Mexico.  some Jehovah witnesses came to our door.  (and that was funny because my father was a preacher then.)  but what really made me laugh was that they told us that Heaven had run out of room and that when we died, our souls went to a tower in New York.  we laughed and then invited them in so they could hear our side of the story.  i don't know if they changed or not but at least the got to hear the truth.|`|f7bcycfgaa	i know!!<br>  its sooo annoying!<br>  i say im not interested and slam the door!|`|46e820e9ba704c6776305bf6a1b991efaa	We won the right to come to your door through the supreme court. You do not need to be rude.  Just tell us not to come back.  We are not trying to recruit.  We can not do that.  Only Jehovah can.  We are trying to warn you about the coming day of Jehovah's wrath.  If you were wise, you would listen to us.  Then if you don't believe us then nothing is lost but a little of your time.  If we call at an inconvenient time, make an appointment.  But it is up to you.  If your neighbors house was on fire, would you not try to warn them.  <br>  <br>  I think the above comments are stupid.  We see it all at the doors and it doesn't bother us.  But it also tells me that we are accomplishing our mission.  To warn people in the whole world about Armageddon.  There is not one person that has not had a visit from us even if they don't answer their door.  Matthew 24:14 is being fullfilled.|`|cO8b7Pniaa	MEEEEEEEE! They used to have a foot in the door policy, which meant if they knocked and you opened, they can literally put their foot over the thresh hold and so you can't close the door on them. <br>  <br>  I don't know if they still have it but they can be very relentless.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	I used to. Then I had a notice made for my door telling them not to ring my bell. Then they are NOT allowed to ring your bell.<br>  <br>  I had an incident where they were at my door for the umpteenth time. I could see who it was and I didn't want to get off the phone. ( I was speaking with an elderly relative). So I cracked my window and said NO THANK YOU. The next thing I knew I had this FURIOUS JW standing in my flower bed knocking on my window with her keys... yelling "You have NO right not to answer the door to me!"<br>  <br>  So I called the police. Being a townhouse development. They were still there 10 minutes later when the police arrived.<br>  <br>  So I'm showing the police my trampled flowers. And the JW comes flying over (sans broom) yelling. "This WOMAN wouldn't even answer her door!"<br>  The cop had all he could do not to laugh in her face. <br>  In the end she paid me $25 on the spot for my flowers... I used it to have the sign made.<br>  <br>  "NO CANVASSING, OR SOLICITORS RELIGIOUS OR OTHERWISE"<br>  <br>  Really works I recommend it. If you tell them they DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT to ring your bell... it then becomes a trespass.<br>  <br>  Keep 'em in their place.|`|cvp0SEBNaa	actually  they do have the right to do that unless you post a sign saying no solicitors.<br>  <br>  if you don't have one of those just stop whining  and get one then they have to stay off you door step|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	they have every right its a free country not a communist country<br>  <br>  just as any one else has the right to go to your door and try to sell any other item<br>  <br>  if you do not want them there say I am not interested and close the door|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	I'm generally a nice person so when they come I just politely let them know that I'm not interested.<br>  <br>    Keep in mind, these people really believe in their cause and beleive they are saving people.

With that, all they do is just leave a pamphlet and leave. Although it is not my religion, I am never disrespectful to them.

Unfortunately, for me, I think they put out the word about me don't knock any more.  <br>  <br>  The last pair were two ladies, one middle aged, and one much older.  I told them that I would be happy to hear whatever they had to say, as long as they agreed, up front, to listen to a little presentation of something about science afterward, from me.  When it came to my turn, I launched into the fundamentals of the theory of evolution and the younger woman just kept responding that no one had ever told her "any of this", while the older woman just stared at her with growing panic on her face.  When I was just about to the conclusion of my little presentation, the older woman just grabbed the younger one by the arm and physically dragged her out my door without a word.  I never saw either of them again.<br>  <br>  I am looking forward to meeting their replacements, but they are way overdue.<br>  <br>  All I have received, since is a few visits from nice, Mormon kids.<br>  <br>  -- <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  John Popelish|`|QC94lBXOaa	I just tell them politely that I'm not interested.|`|nHizaTiDaa	They are honestly sincere about their attempt to bring people to God.<br>  <br>  But, I believe they are very mistaken in that they do not believe that Jesus IS the Son of God.  They think He was just an angel.<br>  <br>  So I bring them to all the comparasions between God and Jesus.<br>  <br>  God, Jehovah- the one JW"s adhere to- says HE is the ONLY God. The ONLY Saviour The Rock, the God who Saves, the creator,  etc etc. That he NEVER CHANGes. That he is the only one who can forgive sins...<br>  <br>  And Jesus is all these things.<br>  <br>  So- who IS Jesus?  God does NOT ALLOW worship of ANYone or thing other than himself.  Yet- Jesus accepted worship, and did not rebuke when Thomas said My lord and my God!<br>  <br>  If Jesus were an angel- he would have solidly rebuked Thomas.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	It's my door I do not open it to any strangers.  <br>  Friends and relations call before they show up so if the door bell rings I might check who it is but nobody invades my home, no solicitors.|`|AT4idiuPaa	Share with them your view of life and love. Ask them what they used to believe before they were Jehovah witness. Get to know them as people, but make sure that you swap ideas equally.

Thanks for asking|`|c8828614b563cd3de41253b6a9e40991aa	I should think that hatred of one's colour would be rooted in experiences of bullying and descrimination based on that colour, or indeed social pressure from others. If you are surrounded by people who reaffirm your personal beauty and value, you learn to appreciate who you are. <br>  <br>   I have observed that no one has what they want or wants what they have. White people curl their hair and sunbathe, dark people sometimes bleach their skin and straighten their hair. And of course industry is right there making money out of people's insecurities and therefore fomenting them.<br>  <br>  I like my colour all right, but I have to say that I find dark skin very attractive. I don't know, it just looks more finished. And they can wear colours I can't. I look awful in yellow, gold, orange and green and they look wonderful on black skin. In fact black skin looks good in any colour.|`|UnG3dS7xaa	I love my skin tone. It protects me from the sun in a way many skin tones can't. I've never worn sunblock or got a sunburn, and I have my brown skin to thank for that. I'm resistant to skin wrinkles as well.

4r6d8Aieaa	It is probably difficult for you as a native speaker of Spanish to explain to someone how to do it because you learned to do this naturally as a young child. It is a matter of explaining the position of the tongue that is required to make the sound. This is the way that I teach it:<br>  <br>  Explore the inside of your mouth with your tongue. <br>  Start with placing your tongue behind your upper front teeth.<br>  Slowly, slide your tongue towards the roof of your mouth.<br>  You will feel a flat area or ledge, and then at the edge of ledge, your tongue will move to the roof of your mouth.<br>  You need to place your tongue flat against that ledge. Don't press hard, keep it loose, but flat.<br>  Keeping the tongue in that position, blow air out of your mouth. You will feel your tongue vibrate against that ledge and it will produce a sound. That is the sound that you are looking for.<br>  <br>  Say the word carro, but forget about the sound that the r makes in English. Just put your tongue against the ledge and blow out. <br>  <br>  To make one r as in claro, only make the tongue tap one time.<br>  To make the rr as in carro, make the tongue tap several times. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|9vBqgoDfaa	Trilling an r is just rolling the tongue to mark the r′s. English speakers in the US when learning Spanish are really concerned with this. What′s the matter?<br>  <br>  Some spanish speakers trill some don′t<br>  Its a matter of culture and practice. It must be learned early in life to really do it.<br>  <br>  I found this:<br>  "You already know how to make this sound: it is the sound American English speakers make saying gotta as in gotta go. Say gotta several times in a row very quickly and pay attention to what your tongue is doing. You should feel it flapping against the roof of your mouth behind your teeth. Now produce the sound alone. Another good exercise is to practice makign a whirring sound: rrrrrrrr. Do these exercises daily until you have mastered this sound..."|`|7o3DMzXQaa	if trill means roll your r's then i heard that it was genetic so that would mean it can't be learned, but it's just hard to believe that someone cannot learn to position there mouth and tongue in a certain way to make a unique sound. i'm gonna go with it's learn-able but hard to teach.|`|vQTYDR1oaa	Some languages require the trill, like in Indonesian language. When I was learning it, I had to keep practising because it's different from English.|`|CQUuCpTQaa	What does that mean?

For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread the LORD has given you to eat."<br>  <br>  John 6:49 "Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died."<br>  <br>  Revelation 2:17 "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

I will also give him a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to him who receives it."<br>  <br>  John 6:58 "This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your forefathers ate manna and died, but he who feeds on this bread will live forever."<br>  <br>  Exodus 16:33 "So Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the LORD to be kept for the generations to come.""<br>  <br>  Based on the last verse, there is still manna somewhere in a jar.  But why look to that?  If you look at John 6:58... Jesus makes it clear... even with the manna they died... but He is the Bread of Life.  We should be looking to Him alone.|`|AA11002471	Manna was whitish and appeared to be waxlike and transparent<br>  Its taste was comparable to “that of flat cakes with honey” or “an oiled sweet cake.” <br>  After being ground in a hand mill or pounded in a mortar, manna was boiled or made into cakes and baked.—Ex 16:23,?31; Nu 11:7,?8.<br>  No natural substance known today fits the Biblical description of manna in every respect.<br>  Jesus referred to himself as manna.<br>  John 6:31-32, "Our forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’” <br>  Hence Jesus said to them: “Most truly I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread from heaven, but my Father does give you the true bread from heaven."<br>  This means, as manna kept the Israelites alive in the desert, so we have life due to Christ.|`|AA11622701	"Manna" was a special type of food that God causes to appear each day for the Jews during the time they were in the wilderness during the Exodus.  Exactly what it was is unknown.  Even it name "manna" is a Jewish slang expression for "what's that...". <br>  <br>  Whatever it was, the Jews were able to make a very sweet type of bread from it that was their main food source during that time.<br>  <br>  The Old Testament says that as soon as they crossed the border into the Promised Land, the manna ceased to appear and it has not been recorded anywhere in the Bible since.  So you would not be able to find any today.|`|AA11992885	manna was a special food, most likely, if it really happened, it was some really strange and funky atmosphereic event that caused something that was edible to descend on to the ground<br>  <br>  but i think you missed why it was called manna.....this is the problem with translations<br>  <br>  Exodus 16:15 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another: 'What is it?'--for they knew not what it was. And Moses said unto them: 'It is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat. <br>  <br>  they didn't know what it was, they didn't say "this is manna" they said "what is it"........the Hebrew is "mon hu".........the word "mon" is what you call "manna"<br>  <br>  they didn't know what it was, no one did<br>  <br>  Exodus 16:31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Mon; and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.|`|206820c72192d15525008e6de3c12f85aa	Manna was God's provision for the people in the wilderness.

However you know him better than I do if he shows interest in you and knows your sexuality then maybe he's trying to hint, get to know him better maybe.    I must admit I'm not completely out as a bisexual and I left my facebook sexuality blank|`|H41u0B8Jaa	Depends on why you think he is into you.  It could be you are attracted to him so are reading things into his actions that may not really be there.  If you are hanging out with him and he is getting all touchy feely with you it could be he is bi or bi curious and is giving you hints so you will make the first move.  If you think that is the case just be very sure about that because you dont' want to make advances towards him if he is straight and may get upset about it.  If you spend time with him then I'm pretty sure you will soon figure it out one way or the other.|`|AA11605300	I suspect you may be correct.

o4UrRbTvaa	Sorry if this is not the "popular" consensus, but every single 11yr old knows that murder is wrong and against the law, they know what prisons are for, and they know that murders go to prison.  The fact that he owned a shotgun, proves that he knew exactly what a gun like that could do to someone.  That "child" knew exactly what he was doing.|`|cb4436697a935c843c809ed2c03d5ccdaa	I read about this story and it's just very sad.  I seriously don't know.<br>  I do believe they will do something.  I don't think he's old enough to go to a prison.  So maybe no... What do you do in a bad situation like this?<br>  <br>  Most 11 year olds don't have access to a shot-gun.<br>  I really believe that is too young to be giving your kid a shot-gun and bullets.  I feel that the father was careless about giving him the bullets to do this with.  I would never allow my son to have a shot-gun.. If he did have a shot-gun I'd sure not ever let him have access to the bullets.  I have to ask myself did the father want his son to actually do it?  Who knows? <br>  Maybe I'm being a nancy grace.. but none of it makes a bit of sense.  If anyone should be charged.. It should be the father.<br>  I really believe any normal parent would not let a child have a shot-gun and bullets...|`|8gveZWbHaa	Who buys a kid a shotgun, ffs!<br>  <br>  Try him a as a child, and try the father as negligent|`|yHfsHp6naa	Of course not. He is obviously a disturbed child.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	It's a terrible thing to happen, but I don't see why the question has even been raised.  People seem to forget that being tried as a child is about whether the culprit is responsible enough to *understand what they've done*, not just a soft option to be disregarded when the crime is bad enough.  Being able to say 'murder is wrong' is not the same as understanding the finality or implications of death, or WHY it's wrong.<br>  <br>  He's a boy.  There may still be time to help him.  To treat him otherwise is madness.<br>  <br>  This is a question that should be raised when a 14 year old accidentally beats someone to death, or a 17 year old shoots someone in cold blood- that is, where their level of maturity and understanding is in question.  In this case, there's a simpler question- *is he a child?*  The answer is yes.  So try him as one.|`|GFJmg9BQaa	obv something was wrong w him he seemed disturbed.<br>  when my little brtoher was 11 (he has some anger probs btw) he didnt go around killing people he found other ways to deal with what ever was going on. but no i dont think he should be tried as an adult i think the kid needs to see a phycologist and get a diognosis to see if theres anything wrong mentally bc obv there is.<br>  <br>  and then go from there|`|HRJDrnBRaa	No, he obviously does not have the mental maturity or emotional capacity to understand the reprehensiveness and repercussions of his action.<br>  <br>  To prosecute an 11 year old as an adult is an oxymoron and a miscarriage of justice.|`|z4Yeofq8aa	The question is is a jury going to be convinced that he was fully aware of what he was doing. With someone that age you have to give them the benefit of any doubt regardless of how serious the offence is.|`|GywOmWfIaa	OK, what the heck is a "youth shotgun?" Maybe I'm just naive but it seems like the father's the one who should be tried.<br>  <br>  Edit: Thank you NRA for the thumbs down.|`|D4fkdZfVaa	I think he should have the adult punishment - of course he should, if he's 'old enough' to be handeling a gun, he's old enough to handel the consequence!|`|mFGyonmTaa	No, but he should be sent to a mental facility immediately.<br>  <br>  He's obviously a disturbed kid...|`|bglr4m0Naa	Yes he should be tried as an adult.|`|c0r3yN5zaa	There is no way this child should be tried as an adult.  Why even distinguish between children and adults judicially, if we're just going to throw out the distinction whenever a child does something that some prosecutor wants to use as a feather in his cap?<br>  <br>  The guy who really ought to be prosecuted as an adult is the dad who bought an emotionally unstable kid a shotgun.|`|PS6Pjtndaa	The law is flawed!  The law itself states that IF we try a person as a child then they go free at 18.  We MUST try them as an adult in order to keep them past 18.  <br>  <br>  WHO SAYS THAT'S THE RULES?  Well, the law!  So, they can change the law!  IF they would address cases like an 11 year old who willfully murdered someone then they could see that he should be kept in a high security juvenile prisoner UNTIL he's 18 then shifted to an adult prison to finish out his term.  <br>  <br>  Make sense?<br>  <br>  But lawmakers are too busy being important to make much sense.|`|ITOBWVakaa	The only thing distressing about that case is that the supreme court doesn't seem to allow the death penalty for offenders under 18. What a shame! The worthless little turd deserves the electric chair!|`|BPO6roTOaa	He's not an adult, so no.|`|XiEGFpYjaa	no he should not. although he is old enough to understand what he did he will get hurt if he goes to jail. he should go to a juvenile detention center.|`|AA10106002	The ultimate dysfunctional family, but he's not an adult. His father should be prosecuted.|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	Not enough details to go on.  It is a wonder that the father was not brought up on charges for irresponsible teachings of firearms.  The gun could be in his room, with a gun lock, but ammo should be locked up with his weapons. <br>  <br>  I would have to think long and hard about giving my children that kind of firepower so young.  My father only gave me a BB gun at 10.  Though history shows if you train a child right he should be able to handle any weapon from black powder to rifles.  Proper training and mindsets are required.
50c1d92064fa2b7852c7d54f841b22d9aa	what are you asking?   I mean I'm well under the line. You might think that with what I have left at the end of the week I'm blowing through my money. In truth I'm buying things I need. Gasoline, Rent, food.   Don't even get me started on the fact that healthy food is out of my price range.   The quality of life that all people should have (at the very lest) Is affordable health care including dental. (Oral health has a direct effect on the rest of your body)   Healthy foods like milk, fresh fruit and veggies should be available and affordable. Canned fruit in corn syrup is not as healthy as a real apple.   Public travel should expand to provide more jobs and to make public transit more bearable and make in faster to get to your destination. That way gasoline is cheaper for commutes that do require you to drive. Not to mention it would help to reduce the green house emissions which would also help asthmatics breathe better.   Make the other necessities easier. Decent housing, more affordable medications, and cleaning up SSI and welfare.   The money thing if you work and can not afford rent open up section 8 for people who work hard to make ends met regardless of weather or not they have children. While families should still get first billing everyone needs shelter.   People who work hard should at lest make a living wage appropriate to their area. IE if you live in DC where housing is 1500 a month at the low end and your company is out of Tempee you should make a wage appropriate to DC not Tempee.   Everyone should be able to met their needs. No one should have to work 40 hrs or more and still not have food or a place to sleep.|`|f48d10d4bec5b5e25f9894010aed2c69aa	i am truly worried when people have to ask that question. i am also confused as to your motive....but then again i bet you are confused about it as well|`|jbDTsZyBaa	Are you saying that the poor have too much if it's more than the bare minimum for survival?

Why just one day to show  your love for someone you care about? We should be doing it all year.|`|Mh8uTZkwaa	I hate Valentine's Day because of the actual meaning.    Valentines Day was in response to when Saint Valentineswas beheaded due to giving iillegalweddings, such as gay weddings. Nothing say 'I Love You' like violence and sodomy.    This is a lot like Christmas. Christmas was from a peagan roman holiday when men of the community gave gifts, drank and ate until they vomited,rampaged the city, and had sex with each other.|`|nZ4cOSDZaa	love valentines day because i'm with my other half now who i have been with for about a year|`|sKdVDQFQaa	Valentines day is very commercialized.   if you love some one you should show that every day, all the time you're with them. not just on one day of the year with a crappy card.   it's also extremely depressing for people who are single and not interested in anyone, what are they supposed to do while all these couples are shoving their love down your throats?!    love is forever, and it isn't shown with a card some chocolates and some flowers.|`|UAhHDV8Raa	I like Valentine's Day because it is the time of the year to show your love to someone.|`|DL6LPvBNaa	because if your going to get your hopes up there is a high risk that your going to be shot down so why do it anyway|`|DtbcpOMRaa	i hate valentines day because it reminds me of all the girls i cant get...everyone who wont date you how lonely you really are...its overrated i think we should just get rid of valentines day

oUDDsVu5aa	He sounds like a perv to me   if you have never talked this way to him before to start this then it sounds like he is assuming that your into this kind of thing have you told him your turned off by it? If not you really need to let him know he is sounding like a perv and you don't get into phone sex or just tell him he is grousing you out and you don't want to bother even meeting him because he is not your type.  being normal a guy would never do something like that unless the girl either asked him to or started the conversation like that herself and then wouldn't continue to keep doing it every time he talked to her after that either he really sounds like he is a perv to me so unless you are into that drop his butt and block his calls after you set him straight to what you like and don't like.  as for you being turned off well maybe you are like most woman you don't like being treated like a sl*t by a guy you have never met and knows nothing about you.  best of luck hope this helps|`|tazfv89qaa	You're turned off because he's a creep!

No, you're turned on alright, but you're a little afraid of what you're getting into. I think you might dig bad boys but in this case your instincts are correct. Continuing with him in any fashion is dangerous. Put an end to it now. If you want to have some anonymous fun, without the chance of meeting, let me know! It's certainly safer.|`|REC4YgOuaa	My best friend set me up with this guy that I had never met and we talked on the phone for awhile and it seemed like he always wanted to talk about sex and I got completely turned off by it. I basically just told him that I he was offending me with the sex conversations and that we didn't have anything in common and that we should so our separate ways. He understood where I was coming from and apologized and I have never heard from him again. Most females don't like men talking about sex alot especially someone that they have never met before it's a huge turn off, it's normal and so don't worry about it. Tell him that you don't appreciate him asking you about sex and that he has turned you off and that you think you guys should go your separate ways. Hope that helps....|`|QIQNzE11aa	Why would you continue to talk to this person? he's looking for someoen to have phone sex with or even real sex with.

Steer clear of this guy.|`|3d1a3c4a191ed64a8f94a10e834bb850aa	First of all, you should have told him he was making you feel uncomfortable rather than trying to give him hints.  Second, while some women like being talked to dirty, from what you have said about yourself, this makes you feel uncomfortable. This is not the guy for you.  He may be expecting much more than you want to or are willing to do, so meeting him and continuing with this relationship will most likely end badly.  I suggest you not meet him, and find someone more to your temperament and liking--i.e. someone you are comfortable with.|`|FcZU29W6aa	Stop talking to him -- he only wants to use you as a sex object.  He doesn't even know you.  He is taking advantage of you and probably laughing about you behind your back.  I wouldn't be surprised to learn he has other boys in the room with him when he is talking to you.    The next time he calls, tell him you never want to hear from him again and to find some other girl that he can treat with no respect and that you are no longer available.    P.S.  You got turned off because this guy is a real turn-off.|`|I2gat01haa	its fine, most people dont like when guys are like that.  its gross. you should just stop talking to him|`|Onzxe6ysaa	seems like he's really pushy. that's a big turnoff, so I understand.

If you meet him all he is going to do is try and have sex with you! If you meet him surely you must have some sexual interest.    If you are turned off then you are not stimulated by his conversation. It is lacking substance and very immature. I recommend meeting someone to your own likings.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	Because you don't want to be a free phone sex operator would be my guess.  If you don't like where the conversation has started with this guy, then my best guess is that it won't get any better by meeting him.  So unless you actually want an ultimately disappointing one night stand with him, I recommend you don't bother continuing to contact him.  Sorry for the bad news.    I hope this helps.|`|rThIVk2maa	You're turned off because this man is behaving like a pig.

3PuKXEwZaa	If I ask you to pray for me would I be worshipping you?  No one would accuse me of worshipping the Lion of Judah if I asked you to pray for me.  It is the same with those already in heaven.  Those in heaven are only asked to pray for us not worshipped.<br>  In the book of Tobit we see that the angel Raphael says to Sarah and Tobit  the following.<br>  Tobit 12:12 reads " I can now tell you that when you, Tobit, and Sarah prayed, it was I who presented and read the record of your prayer before the Glory of the Lord; and I did the same thing when you used to bury the dead."<br>  <br>  So we see that other spirits like saints and angels in heaven can take our prayers before God.  Martin Luther did not agree with the theology though so he got rid of this book.  Although the bible does say that scripture cannot be taken away from.|`|7ufheV16aa	Catholics don't worship Mary or the Saints. We ask them for help because they, especially Mary, were very close to God and did many good deeds and work that not many of us today can do (because of lack of faith/trust in God, for example). We actually do pray to Jesus, too. When we pray to Mary, we ask her to take up our prayer to Jesus, who takes them to His Father. As Catholics, we believe that Mary can intercede for us; we also know that we can ask Mary for help because Jesus would never say no to his mother; he has always been obedient to her, and will always be. It has been proven that Mary has been seen in visions/apparitions, the most famous one being in Fatima, Portugal to 3 young children. In this apparition and many others, Mary has given the world many warnings that if we do not do what she asks, we will not have peace in the world. She asks us to do these things so that she can draw us closer to Jesus, her son. In many visions, Mary has told the visionaries that our sins hurt Jesus very deeply and that God will no longer hold back his wrath upon us. I don't remember the exact words of Mary, but this is just mainly what she constantly speaks about in her apparitions. For more info, look up veneration of Mary or Mary in the Catholic Catechism (you can find it online, too) and Google the miracle of the sun at Fatima.|`|1968f90144181e26eea35ad69e133c4aaa	OK...God is in Heaven, beside him is The Mother of Christ (Mary) and a whole bunch of Saints..<br>  Now we want God's attention...so we ask The Mother of Christ (Mary) to give God a good nudge..and she does..... the end<br>  <br>  This question has been asked so many times it is almost humorous|`|0vmQNf0oaa	I don't ask anyone who has died to pray for me.

Other LIVE Saints can pray to The Lord FOR you!!  (Not Saints that are already in Heaven doing other things for The Lord!)  One should focus on The Holy Triune GodHead and NOT 'mary' and saints' and that is what is wrong with Catholicism!!|`|zRyI5CMGaa	We do pray Direct to Jesus, why do you ask for prayers or say prayers for family and friends (interceding on their or your behalf)?. It's called INTERCESSION we ask Mary and Saints to pray for us just like you would ask a family or friend to pray for you. We pray DIRECTLY to God and Worship God alone not Saints or Mary!.<br>  <br>  And it is Bibilical here you have some referance,Thus, in Psalm 103 we pray, "Bless the Lord, O you his angels, you mighty ones who do his word, hearkening to the voice of his word! Bless the Lord, all his hosts, his ministers that do his will!" (Ps. 103:20–21). And in the opening verses of Psalms 148 we pray, "Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord from the heavens, praise him in the heights! Praise him, all his angels, praise him, all his host!" <br>  <br>  Not only do those in heaven pray with us, they also pray for us. In the book of Revelation, John sees that "the twenty-four elders [the leaders of the people of God in heaven] fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and with golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints" (Rev. 5:8). Thus the saints in heaven offer to God the prayers of the saints on earth. <br>  <br>  Angels do the same thing: "[An] angel came and stood at the altar [in heaven] with a golden censer; and he was given much incense to mingle with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar before the throne; and the smoke of the incense rose with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel before God" (Rev. 8:3–4). <br>  <br>  Catholics and Orthodox Worship God and God alone<br>  <br>  Mary is not dead 'she is no longer in this World' but she is in Heaven. I will give you one easy example that is even in the KJV. When Elijah and Moses appeared to Jesus were they dead?, NO!. We do pray directly and Worship God but we ask the Saints and Mary for intercession ' For them to pray for us'.<br>  <br>  <br>  SweetieRC ???|`|waz8ONEEaa	they ask mary and the saints to confer with jesus/god on their behalf.<br>  <br>  seems like they are being more humble than to assume they should speak directly to jesus/god, and choose to go through various saints.<br>  <br>  you are supposed to be humble, right?|`|AA10096992	I don't worship my parents, but I sometimes ask them for favors. <br>  <br>  What does one have to do with the other?<br>  <br>  Edit: Atheist, but raised catholic.|`|AA11227341	LofJ,<br>  that's simple, actions speak louder than words.

People don't worship Mary or the other Saints in the Catholic Church.  They do venerate them as holy in the eyes of God.  The Catholic Church members also believe that saying a prayer to Mary or another Saint lets them act as an advocate before God.  It's similar to the concept of bringing a lawyer with you to court.  You don't actually need one, but it's a pretty good idea anyway.<br>  <br>  Now I'm not saying that Lion has to follow Catholic doctrine, his religious choice is his own business.

They know that God is the God of the living and not the dead and thus they are praying to the Saint who in turn prays with/for them to God in an intercessory prayer.  I think he stated it better than I did, but that is the the basic idea.  I find the whole Saint thing to be a deification of the person and the Bible clearly gives evidence of living Saints.  Now whether you wish to think like me that we are all called to be Saints or that the "heavy hitters" are the Saints is up to you, but those resting in the Lord cannot hear or intercede and that too is in the Bible.|`|Rn4GXoJAaa	a few examples of titles from the Litany of Loreto include: Holy Mary, Mother of God, Mother of Divine Grace, Mother Most Powerful, Seat of Wisdom, Cause of Our Joy, Singular Vessel of Devotion, Gate of Heaven, Morning Star, Health of the Sick, Refuge of Sinners, Queen of Angels, and Queen of Apostles. Yes, those are just a few! And then this prayer, found in the Catholic pamphlet, “Consecrate Yourself To Mary”: “O Immaculata, Queen of Heaven and earth, refuge of sinners and our most loving Mother, God has willed to entrust the entire order of mercy to you. I, a repentant sinner, cast myself at your feet, humbly imploring you to take me with all that I am and have, wholly to yourself as your possession and property…since it is through your hands that all graces come to us…”|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Because for some reason they don't believe Jesus is a powerful enough mediator...

Then you'll find fish, turtles, birds and the occasional hamster or Guinea pig. The black and Hispanic families I know seem to have more dogs but there are exceptions of those who like cats. My daughter and her family have a Rottie, a Terrier mix and two cats. The Rottie lives outside, she is about 130 lbs and a beautiful dog. The one cat is an outdoor by choice, don't like being inside at all. The mix and the other cat live inside. We have two cats now. No more dogs for a while after spending years showing dogs and competing in Obedience Shows.

Only Allah is perfect, the rest of us are human and commit sins on earth.

If ever a man ruled by a right divine, it was Muhammad, for he had all the powers without their supports. He cared not for the dressings of power. The simplicity of his private life was in keeping with his public life." "In Mohammadanism every thing is different here. Instead of the shadowy and the mysterious, we have history....We know of the external history of Muhammad....while for his internal history after his mission had been proclaimed, we have a book absolutely unique in its origin, in its preservation....on the Substantial authority of which no one has ever been able to cast a serious doubt."<br>  <br>  <br>  Alphonse de LaMartaine in 'Historie de la Turquie,' Paris, 1854.<br>  <br>  "Never has a man set for himself, voluntarily or involuntarily, a more sublime aim, since this aim was superhuman; to subvert superstitions which had been imposed between man and his Creator, to render God unto man and man unto God; to restore the rational and sacred idea of divinity amidst the chaos of the material and disfigured gods of idolatry, then existing. Never has a man undertaken a work so far beyond human power with so feeble means, for he (Muhammad) had in the conception as well as in the execution of such a great design, no other instrument than himself and no other aid except a handful of men living in a corner of the desert. Finally, never has a man accomplished such a huge and lasting revolution in the world, because in less than two centuries after its appearance, Islam, in faith and in arms, reigned over the whole of Arabia, and conquered, in God's name, Persia Khorasan, Transoxania, Western India, Syria, Egypt, Abyssinia, all the known continent of Northern Africa, numerous islands of the Mediterranean Sea, Spain, and part of Gaul. "If greatness of purpose, smallness of means, and astonishing results are the three criteria of a human genius, who could dare compare any great man in history with Muhammad? The most famous men created arms, laws, and empires only. They founded, if anything at all, no more than material powers which often crumbled away before their eyes. This man moved not only armies, legislations, empires, peoples, dynasties, but millions of men in one-third of the then inhabited world; and more than that, he moved the altars, the gods, the religions, the ideas, the beliefs and the souls. <br>  "On the basis of a Book, every letter which has become law, he created a spiritual nationality which blend together peoples of every tongue and race. He has left the indelible characteristic of this Muslim nationality the hatred of false gods and the passion for the One and Immaterial God. This avenging patriotism against the profanation of Heaven formed the virtue of the followers of Muhammad; the conquest of one-third the earth to the dogma was his miracle; or rather it was not the miracle of man but that of reason. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cyberistan.org/islamic/quote1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cyberistan.org/islamic/quote1...</a><br>  <br>  @Edit<br>  <br>  but you are not asking about the "against", you are asking, "was he sinless"??<br>  <br>  beside, Ibelieve that he was sinless, this is whats the Holy Quran says, and since you don't want anything from the Holy Quran, I'm giving you the saying of the non Muslims that studied his life.<br>  <br>  so their saying was based on a deep study, and if you open the link, you will know that they are educated and famous people.<br>  <br>  so, it is not just the Holy Quran, but even those who stdied his life after his death was so impresed with him.|`|MYN4VFJvaa	his biography:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books...</a><br>  <br>  and this:<br>  <a href="http://www.amaana.org/ismailim.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.amaana.org/ismailim.html</a>|`|AA10866541	I believe that no human being is ever sinless in this world, we are all sinners, and there's no exception to that.

6k8GJBRPaa	I don't believe in Atlantis as a separate civilization we don't know yet. My theory is that it's the Minoan civilization in 2000 BC which ended by eruption of a Volcano on the island Santorini. Also because Plato said the Greek army defeated this army.|`|o88qLRgbaa	I believe it probably existed, but not all of the mythological stuff surrounding it.|`|hAp8Orbvaa	I do think. It is most probable that many ancient cities may be under the ocean sea, and we have not yet discovered them. It may be located between africa and america.|`|FYvCR8mvaa	I believe in Atlantis.  I believe Atlantis is probably somewhere in the greater Los Angeles area.  I am of course talking about Atlantis Morrisette.  har de har|`|AZKHHfr5aa	Nope. It was a place created by Plato in an incomplete work of his. Atlantis was not mentioned by any other ancient source for quite some time afterwards, until his work was rediscovered. The details that he gives the island are physically impossible to have been present inside the Mediterranean and there is no evidence outside the Mediterranean that such a large place existed. Additionally, he claims that the Athenians were at war with them during a time when, archeologically speaking, we know that Athens could not have fought off a band of starving children.    The "evidence" for the existence of Atlantis is generally quite slipshod. For example, the existence of pyramids in Egypt and South America are cited as evidence of a single culture inspiring both. However, pyramids are the simplest possible construction shape, the two types of pyramids are vastly different, and they were constructed centuries apart from each other.    Then there are some claims that there are roads underwater that "prove" that the land must have been above water in the past. However, these roads and structures are made from sandstone (gasp, sand, near the ocean?! Totally evidence of an ancient civilization). It is a known naturally occurring phenomenon in which shore sand gets turned into sandstone and eventually collapses into the ocean, usually in block-like shapes.|`|OUiWjH7Gaa	I like to think that its true on some level. The idea of a culture outsmarting itself is most definitely true. Look at Roman culture for example. Not to get too deep, but what if time were a loop - you know, like the Wheel of Time and the legend of Atlantis were really remnants of the fall of America. With all of our technological advances, it seems we could be headed for such a fate. So, maybe Atlantis is America?     The truth is the idea, nobody can refute the truth in the idea.|`|AIuN5Lw9aa	I agree with Lourdes F. A professor in the early 1900s named K.T. Frost sent an anonymous letter to the London Times suggesting that Minoan civilization was the Atlantis described by Plato.

Oh yeah - and the island is suspected to be one of the Greek isles in the Mediterranean Sea.|`|SpcYCBndaa	maybe  maybe not|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	I think it was just Minoan civilization their volcano blew up they lived on a island half of it disappeared after the volcano blew, they were really the 1st advanced country in the Mediterranean like 8000 years ago|`|0QTCiCf8aa	I truly hope it is real, I have childish faith in those sorts of things....|`|O8qyhAegaa	Looks like this place sank... wait I've heard a rumor about something like that...  http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/60938...

Otherwise I'm not a particular believer of the modern day legend of Atlantis. Hope I was of some help.|`|AA12384132	Yes I believe that Atlantis existed, But I also believe that Atlantis was ripped apart and scattered across the atlantic Ocean and their is no one alive that could ever put Atlantis back together Again.. Atlantis was totally destroyed by the actions of several volcano's including the one it was sitting on that really blew that island apart and there are only remnants and pottery and things that lie outside that island that survived that total destruction....... And parts of that Island is now buried under tons of volcanic ash with tons of water pressing it deeper under the ocean floor.....

"7.33": Say: My Lord has only prohibited indecencies, those of them that are apparent as well as those that are concealed, and sin and rebellion without justice, and that you associate with Allah that for which He has not sent down any authority, and that you say against Allah what you don't know.    Why the double standards. The question is who are MEN to MANDATE Hijab when it is NOTHING to do with them. Why should women cover from head to toe yet men roam free. So why should men be allowed to wear a T-shirt, why should men not cover their chest. Why do men not cover their hair not to mention it is Sunnah as it was very hot and our beloved Prophet(PBUH) among many other Sahab(R) used to cover their hair.     The most important thing is who are men to impose on women. First you comply to the rules before you point at others. Men also must be modest and if refuse MUST be demonized and pressured as well. Men MUST also be made to comply to wear specific dress code why are MEN above the rules and allowed to roam free?     - Men must be covered from shoulders to the legs  - Must not wear tight or revealing clothing  - Must not wear any hair gel etc that can attract attention and of course preferable that they cover their hair  - Men must not wear anything that draws attention  - Men to must be Modest and remain Chaste  - Make sure chest is covered  - Lower their Gaze    So before men point fingers and think they are above anything and women are their properties . . . they MUST themselves comply first. No doubt women themselves must take the blame as well . . . Why do they let men Impose and Dictate!!|`|VVk0hHgpaa	men should dress modest just like a woman should dress modest.  some people follow the dress code and others don't.|`|KlYMqKCsaa	there isn't really a dress code...just don't walk around naked.    but it is better to keep a beard|`|1ZVtTII8aa	a man has to cover from navel to knee and it is waajib for him to keep a beard.    oh yeah and they aren't allowed to wear silk, the colours red or gold, and their trousers have to be slightly above the ankle.  :PP  xx|`|C9KWIb5Saa	Can't be too tight.

Can't be clothes of the opposite sex (women).|`|SCkhQc2Caa	There follows a summary of the rulings on dress for men. We ask Allaah to make it sufficient and beneficial.    1. The basic principle concerning everything that is worn is that it is halaal and permissible, except for that concerning which there is a text to state that it is haraam, such as silk for males, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: These two [gold and silk] are forbidden for the males of my ummah and permissible for the females. Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 3640; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. Similarly it is not permissible to wear the skin of a dead animal (one that has died of natural causes) unless it has been tanned. With regard to wearing clothes made of wool, goat hair and camel hair, these are pure and permissible.    2. It is not permissible to wear thin or see-through clothing that does not conceal the awrah.    3. It is haraam to imitate the mushrikeen and kuffaar in their manner of dress, so it is not permissible to wear clothing that is unique to the kuffaar.    It was narrated that Abd-Allaah ibn Amr ibn al-Aas said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw Ali wearing two garments dyed with safflower and said: These are garments of the kuffaar; do not wear them.    [Narrated by Muslim, 2077.]    4. It is haraam for women to imitate men and men to imitate women in the way they dress, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the men who imitate women and the women who imitate men. [Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5546.]    5. It is Sunnah for a Muslim to start with the right when dressing, and to say, Bismillaah (In the name of Allaah), and to start with the left when taking clothes off.    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: When you get dressed and when you do wudoo, start on the right. [Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4141; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami, 787.]    6. It is Sunnah for the one who is putting on a new garment to thank Allaah and make duaa.    It was narrated that Abu Saeed said: When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) put on a new garment, he would call it by its name, whether it was a turban, a shirt or a cloak, then he would say: Allaahumma laka al-hamd anta kasawtanihi asaluka khayrahu wa khayri ma sunia lah wa aoodhu bika min sharrihi wa sharri ma sunia lah (O Allaah, to You be all praise. You have clothed me with it. I ask You for the good of it and the good for which it was made, and I seek refuge with You from the evil of it and the evil for which it was made).    [Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1767; Abu Dawood, 4020; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami, 4664].    7. It is Sunnah to pay attention to keeping one's clothes clean, without feeling arrogant or exaggerating about that.    It was narrated from Abd-Allaah ibn Masood that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: No one will enter Paradise in whose heart is a mustard-seed of arrogance. A man said: What if a man likes his clothes to look nice and his shoes to look nice? He said: Allaah is Beautiful and loves beauty; arrogance means rejecting the truth and looking down on people.    [Narrated by Muslim, 91.]    8. It is mustahabb to wear white clothes    It was narrated that Ibn Abbaas said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Wear white clothes, for they are the best of your clothes, and shroud your dead in them.    [Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 994, hasan saheeh. This is what the scholars regarded as mustahabb. Also narrated by Abu Dawood, 4061; Ibn Maajah, 1472. ]    9. It is haraam for the Muslim man to let any garment he wears hang down beneath his ankles (an action known as isbaal); the limit for any garment is the ankles.    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said; Whatever of the lower garment is beneath the ankles is in the Fire.    [Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5450.]    It was narrated from Abu Dharr that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: There are three to whom Allaah will not speak on the Day of Resurrection and will not look at them or praise them, and theirs will be a painful torment. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) repeated it three times. Abu Dharr said: May they be doomed and lost; who are they, O Messenger of Allaah? He said: The one who lets his garment hang beneath his ankles, the one who reminds others of favours he has done, and the one who sells his product by means of false oaths.    [Narrated by Muslim, 106.]    10. It is haraam to wear garments of fame and vanity, which means a garment that stands out from others so that people will look at the wearer and he will become known for it.    It was narrated that Ibn Umar said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever wears a garment of fame and vanity, Allaah will dress him in a garment like it on the Day of Resurrection.    According to another version, then set it ablaze. And according to a third version, will dress him in a garment of humiliation.    [Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4029; Ibn Maajah, 3606 and 3607; classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 2089.]  _________________________________|`|iU3vCY9Eaa	Don't wear silk or gold    Don't show your body below the navel    Don't imitate women because then you're just plain gay!|`|ZOFM0g9haa	Must not tight:  http://image.orientaltrading.com/otcimg/...  http://www.geekologie.com/2007/07/11/dar...

If you mean just music, anything with strings is not allowed, per Rasul Allah (saaw).|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Okay, you know how the Quran says that Allah gave King David the Psalms?    Well, do you know what the Psalms are?    They are songs.    Songs meant to be sung with musical accompaniment.    So if music is haram, God would not have given David the Psalms.|`|AA11922696	Allah says: {And of Mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singingetc.) to mislead (men) from the path of Allah without knowledge, and takes it (the path of Allah, the verses of the Quran) by way of mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment in the Hell-fire} [31:6] This verse is an explanatory apposition of what proceeds it which explains the state of the (Muhsinun) good-doers who perform Salah, give Zakah and believe faithfully in the Hereafter. Allah mentioned that those who refuse to profit from Allahs words, and who prefer listening to music & songs will be humiliated in the Hell-fire. According to Ibn Kathir, al-Hassan al-Basri explained the verse [31:6] above as being revealed on singing and music. But this is only if the person is too inclined to these things. Taking singing and playing the guitar as hobbies is unlawful. One instead should use his leisure time in lawful and useful matters in this life and the Hereafter. Listening to music is unlawful for the following Hadith: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: A time will come where people will make adultery, fornication, silk, guitars and wine lawful. So, as long as listening to music was counted among these unlawful things, it shouldnt then be taken as a hobby. Allah knows best.  http://islamweb.net/ver2/fatwa/ShowFatwa...    There are many types of singing. Each kind has a different rule. 1- If the singing contains any musical instrument, then it is Haram for both men and women. 2- Many scholars have sanctioned prohibition of listening to the musical instruments. Among them are IMAM QURTUBI, AL-TABARI, IBN AS-SALAH, IBN RAJAB, IBN AL QAYYIM and IBN HAJAR AL-HAYTAMI. IMAM QURTUBI said: Listening to reeds, strings, drums etc. is Haram. I do not know a jurist in the past or the present permitted it. How would it not be Haram? This is the motto of drinkers, dissolutes and shameless people. If the matter is as stated here, then nobody doubts its prohibition and nobody denies that whoever uses these things is a disobedient". This is narrated by IBN HAJAR AL-HAITAMI in his famous book AL ZAWAJIR MIN IQTIRAFIL KABAIR. As regards (DUFF) Tambourine, it is permitted for women in the occasions of EID & marriage. 2  If the singing is not accompanied by a musical instrument, it is of two kinds: A. Singing of women for men. This is absolutely Haram. Islam forbids women from calling for the AZAN and reciting the Qur'an in the presence of men. If a woman sings for ladies saying something containing good words, then it is permitted. B. Singing of a man. If he is singing good poetry that involves good subjects, then many jurists have permitted it. If it contains bad things like calling to depravity, abomination or describing a woman's body, etc. then it is prohibited.     Allah knows best.  http://islamweb.net/ver2/fatwa/ShowFatwa...|`|be059bdf4ef4d8d4f864f42d17a8e06eaa	No definitive answer.

bfWcfCKXaa	It is a practice of Catholics and many Protestant Churches. Lent is the 40 day period of fasting before Easter. Ash Wednesday is the first day of Lent. Ashes are placed on the forehead to remind people of their mortality - "from dust you were created and to dust you shall return." It is the beginning of the fast. Fasting is biblical. References to wearing "sackcloth and ashes" appear in the Old Testament as a sign of both mourning and repentence. Easter reminds Christians of the hope of the resurrection. On Easter the fast is broken in celebration of resurrecton. There is an Evangelical misconception that those who observe Lent do so out of "works righteousness" as if they do not believe Jesus died for their sins. This is false. They do believe this and that he rose from the dead so that all may have life. They observe Lent as a special memorial of human weakness and the need for Christ. The ashes for ash Wednesday are made from burnt palms from the previous year's Palm Sunday celebration.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Try it sometime! Go to any Catholic Church or liturgical Protestant Church on Ash Wednesday. You will be welcome. You will still be a follower of Christ afterwards. You can go back to your own church the next Sunday. It is an ancient Christian practice. See what you have in common with other Christians and do not judge what you do not understand.|`|zhaHc4FAaa	The liturgical use of ashes originated in the Old Testament times. Ashes symbolized mourning, mortality and penance. In the Book of Esther, Mordecai put on sackcloth and ashes when he heard of the decree of King Ahasuerus to kill all of the Jewish people in the Persian Empire (Esther 4:1). Job repented in sackcloth and ashes (Job 42:6). Prophesying the Babylonian captivity of Jerusalem, Daniel wrote, "I turned to the Lord God, pleading in earnest prayer, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes" (Daniel 9:3). <br>  Jesus  made reference to ashes, "If the miracles worked in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they would have reformed in sackcloth and ashes long ago" (Matthew 11:21). <br>  In the Middle Ages, the priest would bless the dying person with holy water, saying, "Remember that thou art dust and to dust thou shalt return." <br>  The Church adapted the use of ashes to mark the beginning of the penitential season of Lent, when we remember our mortality and mourn for our sins. In our present liturgy for Ash Wednesday, we use ashes made from the burned palm branches distributed on the Palm Sunday of the previous year. The priest blesses the ashes and imposes them on the foreheads of the faithful, making the sign of the cross and saying, "Remember, man you are dust and to dust you shall return," or "Turn away from sin and be faithful to the Gospel." As we begin this holy season of Lent in preparation for Easter, we must remember the significance of the ashes we have received: We mourn and do penance for our sins. We again convert our hearts to the Lord, who suffered, died, and rose for our salvation. We renew the promises made at our baptism, when we died to an old life and rose to a new life with Christ. Finally, mindful that the kingdom of this world passes away, we strive to live the kingdom of God now and look forward to its fulfillment in heaven.|`|jsM8F4bLaa	I thought it was "Jayden's" mom?|`|W0qNkROpaa	Why did you think it was called Ash Wednesday if you didn't know ashes were involved?

You wont have much trouble finding the size becuase it asks for your regular size, (e.g. UK size 8 etc...) and also your height range. =)   http://www.desertstore.com/products-For-...  very simple http://www.desertstore.com/products-For-...  it's not too pricey either. =)    there are other stores online. =)|`|SzqeeUxgaa	well, basically  abaya is sort of more loose and mostly front bottom open where as burqa is like a coat. closed till bottom~!|`|3E2EQH12aa	i am 5' 4 too, and i dont think ive had a problem ever finding ones that fit. u can order things in diff sizes obviously, but even in the stores here (i like paterson nj) you can find a huge huge variety .. sounds like you should try a size 1.. they come in different lengths, but as far as it being a curtain, you can get them for more slender ladies that still arent clingy, but its not like wearing a 3 or a 4, which they just call "one size fits all" lol i prefer to wear a 2 the 1 is too tight across my chest...just keep looking. :)|`|sE94HgDBaa	Try a smaller size.  If the length is too long, hem the bottom a bit.  It's easy to hem on your own, if you can't a taylor can take care of it for cheap.

Social evolution works even faster than biological evolution.|`|LjsRfaskaa	All of it is man made including the bible. None of the material is original to Christianity but taken from other cultures.

No, in his eyes he thought he was doing the right thing (granted he was VERY wrong and messed up), but the point is that morals come from within, each of us derive our morals from experience and elders, weather they are right in the eyes of the majority or not. <br>  <br>  You've opened up a good Christian contradiction.

SCkhQc2Caa	sunni marrying the People of Innovation ( like Raafidis -shias ) is Haraam.  _________________________|`|FYjf7hkEaa	Yes. Its so wrong, you would be better off marrying a Jew.|`|tUSOzNdBaa	I don't know. But, I'm guessing no. Because we are Muslims. But, we have our differences...|`|e3PWZYsAaa	Salam,    your question is like, is it haram to marry a muslim?    Muslims can marry other muslims.      2:285  "The messenger believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers; they all believe in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers; We make no difference between any of His messengers; and they say: We hear and obey, our Lord! Thy forgiveness (do we crave), and to Thee is the eventual course."    this is what you need to believe to be a muslim, and the laws of Allah SWT say you can marry a muslim.    Peace|`|mVSC9aKoaa	It is haram. In general shia seek help from Ali RA along with Allah.|`|UpIjgNV5aa	No it is NOT Haram, are Shias not Muslims? So you're saying it is permissible to Marry people of the Book but not Shias.     There is no doubt they are allowed to get married, but the problem is how each see their faith and hence the discouragement. How Both Shia & Sunnis see religion is completely different right from the core base, how they see their spiritual connection, their believes. Even though there are similarities but it is the differences that deeply matter. There is NO compromise literally unless one accepts the others views.    Do you see all the Shia/Sunni questions here, imagine in real life. What about when they have a family what would children be Shia or Sunni? So it is allowed but discouraged due to differences.|`|XCTUmHPLaa	practically ,two different religion can not stay under one roof     Sunni Muslims will say YA ALLAH and Shia will say YA ALI     how does it sound     this is practically not possible ,even if its not haram ,one compromise on shirk|`|7Q1dJoFzaa	do what you feel forget all these artificial restrictions|`|4PbjKk7Vaa	A Shia can marry a sunni and a sunni can marry a shia       but a shia cant mary a wahabie  coz wahabies are worse than jews|`|vnty8yOgaa	Learn first.|`|nS7koC7Oaa	It's Haram, i agree with Shahky  Ramadan,,|`|CQz8dMzFaa	No.|`|VN30ib8eaa	Its 100 % forbidden.

The most severe are the Rafidah, the Khumainiyah and the Ithna-'Ashariyah sects, due to the great number of callers that promote them and because they engage in major polytheism such as invoking Ahlul Bayt, as well as believing that people have knowledge of the unseen [such as future events etc], specifically the 'twelve Imams' as they claim. They also declare the majority of the companions of the Prophet [may the Salaat and Salaam be upon him], to be disbelievers and insult them, such as Abu Bakr and 'Umar may Allah be pleased with them both. We ask Allah to protect us from the falsehood they are upon.    There are many differences between the Shia and Ahlus Sunnah relating to monotheism, Prophet-hood, leadership and other issues.     So some sects of the Shia are outside the fold of Islam, they have beliefs that are in total contradiction to the Islaamic creed, they are not considered to be Muslims at all. Others have beliefs that may not take them out of the fold of Islam, but they are non the less considered to be innovators, engaging in practices that have nothing to do with the religion of Islam. And no the actions of Shia militants are not reflective of Islamic values, nor are the actions of any other militant sect for that matter.  http://www.islaam.ca/forum/26.html  http://www.islamweb.net/ver2/Fatwa/ShowF...

I do not know  what is dhol, duff ( without any bells) is allowed to play at wedding ceremonies,welcoming and at 2 eids.    but scholars say it is only allowed to play by children or women. Men are not allowed to play that.  ___________________________|`|ABJG1lLWaa	strictly speaking the dhol is haraam, but it is accepted in many muslim cultures at weddings...|`|6fFNdlNfaa	incase u didnt know you can get halal islamic songs called nasheed. most scholars agree that the duff instrument is halal as long as the song is about islam and promotes taqwa.
WfwFuQB0aa	i have previously googled China and it has some really interesting facts, give it a go and good luck.|`|SsfnitjXaa	The people in China what the same things you do.  A roof over their head and food on their table. They want their children to be better educated then they are.  The communist government is not what the democratic countries think.  The people in China stand up for their rights and demand better health care and education.  (Unlike in the USA where no one will stand up and demand health care).  <br>  <br>  The government does not allow ultrasounds to determine sex.  The government does not allow abortions of female children, just because they are female.  The government does educate people not to over populate as their already have so many people to try to feed.  Churches are built and any one can attend without scrutiny.  The government does not allow anyone to stay in their country that test positive for HIV or herpes (every one is tested who request a visa).  There are very little drugs in China as drug dealers are killed as are crooked politicians.

Paul repeats the same idea in Colossians 2:16,17  "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:  Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ."  <br>  <br>  What Paul is saying is that there is no specific law about what days should be worshiped or what holidays should be kept.  If you read the New Testament there is not a single commandment anywhere to keep any holidays (including Sunday services.)  The requirement to keep special feast days or worship on a certain day of the week was part of the Mosaic Law, and is not carried over to Christianity.<br>  <br>  Rather Paul is saying that if a person is convinced that they should keep a holiday as a worship to Christ, then for them it is the right thing, and no other Christian should judge them.  They are showing respect and love for God. and celebrating what he did for them.  That is never wrong.<br>  <br>  However, if a person chooses not to celebrate that day, or does it in a different way, then that is also correct because they are showing their respect and love for God.  And no other Christian should judge them.<br>  <br>  The keeping of "Easter" can be found in the writing of the early church fathers as far back as the late first century (with 30-40 years of the time Paul completed his writings.)  The celebration of the Paschal (as it was called at the time) was done during the same week as the Passover.  There was debate on where Christians should celebrate by taking the Passover feast (as it was a Passover feast that was the "Last Supper", and Jesus told them "keep that" until he returned) the evening before, then celebrate the Death of Christ the next day, or whether they should wait and take Communion (the sacrament that comes out of the last Passover meal) and the Sunday of his resurrection.  Because the day of the Passover changes each year, it was easier for the church to celebrate the Resurrection on Sundays since they were already meeting then.  So by the late second century that was the common practice.<br>  <br>  Christmas was actually celebrated by the early churches in mid-January rather then December 25.  It is still practiced on that day in many Orthodox churches.  As the actual day of Christ's birth is not known, it was decided within the Roman part of the church to celebrate on December 25 (the date of the largest pagan feast in the Roman world) to give the Christians an alternative to celebrate on that day.  Kind of like the thousands of churches in the US today that offer "Harvest Celebration" and similar alternative to Halloween parties on October 31.  It gives those who do not want to celebrate the pagan holiday an alternative.  As there are no instructions saying to celebrate Christmas, nor how to do it, then the giving of presents at that time is just as valid a way to celebrate as any other.<br>  <br>  So the rule is simple when it comes to holy days in the Christian faith.  Do what honors Christ for you, and everyone else keep their mouth shut, and honor Christ they way they way instead.|`|NLinPsyhaa	The only festivals mentioned in the Bible are those of Jewish tradition and custom. I am not Jewish. Easter really comes from the original festival of the passover. We celebrate Easter and Christmas on or about the same times as pagan holidays as a counter celebration.  Did you also know that the marriage ceremony is also taken from pagan rituals? The flowers, the ring, both pagan ideas.|`|gGmMw2vDaa	I do not mean to put down your beliefs. Still, do I not have the right in your eyes to laugh at what I consider to be silly, childish beliefs?|`|6JimMvcDaa	Where in the Bible can you find the practice of lent. It is a tradition that you are bound by and do not want to put down. What if God told you that it was not O.K. to do lent? Would you then omit it out of your religious practices? I'm not trying to be disrespectful. I truly want you to see that you are following a pagan practice instituted by man and not God. <br>  <br>  It is not my faith. The Bible plainly states there is one Lord and One faith. The Bible is the word of God. If any man come preaching any other he is a thief and a liar the Bible states. There is only one faith but many religions. If you do not follow the words of our Lord Jesus Christ you are just another religious person following another mans doctrine. I follow the doctrine of Jesus. You follow the doctrine of the Catholic. Which is greater ? <br>  <br>  I do not celebrate christmas and easter . I observe the passover as Jesus did in the Bible. I do nothing that came from idol worship. I serve Jesus and his way. There is a way that seemeth right unto a man but the ways are death the Bible says. <br>  <br>  Youth groups are good if they follow the word of God. But if it is to please the flesh then it is another design by man. What would Jesus do ? That is a great saying among religous folks. But they do not consider the realism about it. A christian is called a christian because they are suspose to be Christ Like. Do like Jesus. Think like Jesus. Live like Jesus. Not after the order of  the world religions. <br>  <br>  Agree fasting is good with prayer, seeking the answers from the Lord. But if you do it because the church says it is a religion you are doing it for the wrong reason. God has given you a free will. Not to be bound with man's ideas. That is the reason everyone can have the word of God and read it for them selves. What is truth ? Who is true ? Man or God ? Chose you this day whom will you serve? God or Mammon ? God or the world, the worlds religions. There are many. Many come in my name, and decieve many. Are you being decieved ? <br>  <br>  I'm not putting down your belief. I'm trying to show you that Jesus desires you to be in truth. He has opened this door for you to see the light and not to walk in darkness as your fathers have walked. He wants you to be free.He wants you to read your word, study to see if you are in the truth. Broad is the road to destruction, and many go there. We have a world full of religions, but yet the bible says many shall not find the straight and narrow path, because they chose false rather than truth. <br>  <br>  Choose you this day who you will serve. God is merciful. God is not willing that any be lost but all should come to him. God Bless !|`|mFGyonmTaa	Christmas was origanally a pagan holiday.<br>  <br>  Everybody can celebrate any holiday they want, in any way they want.<br>  <br>  NEXT!|`|NXTpQSdhaa	Who are you talking too here?

Easter is also a celebration of the risen savior,I celebrate that he is risen that he died foe us that through him I live again.<br>  Halloween was always un important in our home ,we let kids trick or treat but we talked about what we believe. I believe you don't let kids  kids you make them weird,we let them be normal with explanation.<br>   The problem I have with Catholicism is many. I was raised Catholic until age 8 I was told that I was going to hell because we missed a Sunday of church! The hard turn or burn approach. I spent 38 years as an atheist/agnostic because of Catholicism I believe it has turned more people away from Christ as it has towards. Many in your faith do not  invite Christ as lord and savior and are led to believe it is by the church they are saved. This is cult teaching and not Biblical. When God led me to him 16 years ago, I was shocked to see these people carrying Bibles as most in your faith do not read it! I do not put down your belief I believe their are many in Catholic faith that are saved and do read the Bible but it is not stressed as needed and many are going to be held accountable by poor doctrine.|`|zHle6Paqaa	<<<Why do you celebrate Christmas and Easter.

I believe they are. They are central to Christian Belief. Jesus fulfilled the Jewish prophecy of The Messiah. He is the Messiah Christians rejoice in.<br>  <br>  Did Jesus celebrate Holiday's?<br>  On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, <br>  the disciples approached Jesus and said, <br>  "Where do you want us to prepare <br>  for you to eat the Passover?" <br>  He said, <br>  "Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, <br>  'The teacher says, "My appointed time draws near; <br>  in your house I shall celebrate the Passover with my disciples."'" <br>  The disciples then did as Jesus had ordered, <br>  and prepared the Passover. <br>  <br>  <br>  1Cor chapter 5<br>  7 Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new paste, as you are unleavened. For Christ our pasch is sacrificed. <br>  <br>  8 Therefore let us feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but ***with*** the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. <br>  <br>  Did you know the alphabet is Pagan in origin? Yep, Pagan symbols. <br>  Did you know mathematics are Pagan in origin? Yep, again the same.<br>  So, every time we read or write or apply mathematics we're performing a Pagan act?<br>  I think not.  <br>  <br>  Thanksgiving and the 4th of July are not even an issue.<br>  <br>  God Bless.|`|zvafRreyaa	A curious contradiction happens every year. Virtually all the Christian world will observe the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ in unison, on the first Sunday after the first full moon after the Spring Equinox as decreed by the Council of Nicea in 325 A.D. However, if this paschal full moon occurs on a Sunday, Easter is then moved to the next Sunday. The Council of Nicea also decided that the Christian Easter shall never precede or coincide with the Jewish Passover, but must always follow it, a rule still observed by the Eastern Orthodox Church, but not the Western Church. The Eastern Orthodox church also still uses the Julian calendar to calculate Easter, and so frequently does not agree with the Western Church on dates.<br>  <br>  This presents a very interesting situation, since the Protestants generally will subscribe to the motto of Sola Scriptura, the Bible only for doctrine, yet the Catholic affirms the authority of Church Tradition.<br>  Now if you strictly follow the Bible as your guide as to when to observe Passover, you would ALWAYS be observing the crucifixion in the middle of the biblical month, very close to the full moon. This is because the biblical month begins with the observation of the new moon, and Passover the Bible tells us, is celebrated on 14 Nisan, the middle of the 29.5 day lunar cycle (the synodic month):|`|wuM15a5iaa	We celebrate Christmas because that is the birth of Jesus Christ.

wB3AbJyLaa	Hindus believe in one god, Brahman. But they believe that there are a lot of other gods that are part of Brahman. They also believe that fate directly influences people's lives. Society in India, a primary Hindu nation, is controlled by a caste system. There are define lines between the different social classes, and once you're born into a particular class, you're not getting out of it without a enormous fight. Hindus also believe that people are reincarnated after they die; what you come back as is determined by your actions here on earth. That's called karma. So most Hindus are vegetarians, you wouldn't want to eat your Uncle Leo in your hamburger at lunch. They view cows as scared, they definitely don't eat them. If you achieve enlightenment while you're in your life here on earth, you go to nirvana when you die. There are four kinds of yoga Hindus can practice to become enlightened, these include both meditation and physical exercise. Hindus are all tolerant of other religious beliefs. As long as you're a sincere believer of an authentic religion then you're good to go. This is because they think no one religion, including Hinduism, teaches the only way to salvation. All souls will eventually be saved because everyone is moving closer to union with god in this or some other life.|`|aeJdAXLTaa	are you gonna "pick holes" on hindu belief?there is a lot of books discussing hindu belief besides you can ask your sister in law.|`|VAZaZ9s9aa	The basis of Hinduism is the foundation of religions like the gods in Norse, Greek, and Roman mythology.<br>  <br>  Gods were used as symbols to represent various events, attributes, and so forth, to help people comprehend the "bigger picture" of existence.

It served to keep the lower castes in order too, so it served its purpose many times over. What we see of Hinduism today is not the same as Hinduism 1000 years ago, though.<br>  <br>  Personally, I believe that the pre-Judeo-Christian religions are stronger than the ones we have these days, which almost seem to be designed for mass manipulation.
QgE85Qynaa	Arabic, for English speakers at least, is painfully difficult. Even under optimal circumstances (living in an Arabic-speaking country with little or no English communication) it would take a minimum of two years of nothing-but-study in order to gain a basic grasp of the language.

03Xx7l8Baa	As many have already stated before me it is a matter of personal taste EXCEPT for it that name has a bad meaning. <br>  <br>  A good example is one of the Prophet's (pbuh) companions Abu Huraira (ra). Perhaps you've heard his name before? He was a major contributor to the hadiths or narrations of the Prophet (pbuh) life. <br>  <br>  -- Abu Hurayrah became a Muslim at the hands of at-Tufayl ibn Amr the chieftain of the Daws tribe to which he belonged. The Daws lived in the region of Tihamah which stretches along the coast of the Red Sea in southern Arabia. When at-Tufayl returned to his village after meeting the Prophet and becoming a Muslim in the early years of his mission, Abu Hurayrah was one of the first to respond to his call. He was unlike the majority of the Daws who remained stubborn in their old beliefs for a long time.<br>  <br>  When at-Tufayl visited Makkah again, Abu Hurayrah accompanied him. There he had the honor and privilege of meeting the noble Prophet who asked him: "What is your name?"<br>  <br>  "Abdu Shams - Servant of a Sun," he replied.<br>  <br>  "Instead, let it be Abdur-Rahman - the Servant of the Beneficent Lord," said the Prophet.<br>  <br>  "Yes, Abdur-Rahman (it shall be) O Messenger of God," he replied. However, he continued to be known as Abu Hurayrah, "the kitten man", literally "the father of a kitten" because like the Prophet he was fond of cats and since his childhood often had a cat to play with.<br>  <a href="http://www.mohammad-pbuh.com/3/abuhurerah.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mohammad-pbuh.com/3/abuhurera...</a><br>  <br>  Because cats/kittens were always following him around and he was always seen with one, he became known as abu huraira.<br>  <br>  ANYWAY :p... because a slave of the sun isn't appropriate, he got his name changed. <br>  <br>  Many people do prefer to change it for many personal reasons.

Had catholicism existed during the time of Acts, the first Christians would have rejected catholicism completely. <br>  <br>  Also here's Christians that called the "pope" the antichrist, and who also completely rejected catholicism, long before Martin Luther was even born:<br>  <br>  c. 1310<br>  Dante Alighieri <br>  c. 1331<br>  Michael of Cesena <br>  c. 1345<br>  Johannes de Rupescissa <br>  c. 1350<br>  Francesco Petrarch <br>  c. 1367<br>  John Milicz <br>  c. 1379<br>  John Wycliffe <br>  c. 1388<br>  Matthias of Janow <br>  c. 1389<br>  R.

Catholicism is not Christian. Catholicism teaches a false gospel of works that cannot save (Galatians 1:6-9).|`|f8wSp1h2aa	In this letter is recorded the first known use of the words "Catholic Church"...<br>  Paragraph #8<br>  "You must all follow the lead of the bishop, as Jesus Christ followed that of the Father; follow the presbytery as you would the Apostles; reverence the deacons as you would God's commandment. Let no one do anything touching the Church, apart from the bishop. Let that celebration of the Eucharist be considered valid which is held under the bishop or anyone to whom he has committed it. Where the bishop appears, there let the people be, just as where Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church. It is not permitted without authorization from the bishop either to baptize or to hold an agape; but whatever he approves is also pleasing to God. Thus everything you do will be proof against danger and valid." The first recorded use of the word is found in the writings of Ignatius of Antioch, who was a young man during the time of the apostles and was the second bishop of Antioch following Peter, who went on to become bishop of Rome. Ignatius was immersed in the living traditions of the local church in Antioch, where the believers in Christ were first called Christians (cf. Acts 11:26). He was taught and ordained directly by the apostles. From the apostles Ignatius learned what the Church was—how it was to function, grow, and be governed.<br>  <br>  History informs us that Peter was the bishop of Antioch at the time; in fact, Church Fathers claim that Ignatius was ordained by Peter himself. Ignatius must have worshiped with Peter and Paul and John. He lived with or near them and was an understudy of these special apostles. Ignatius is known and revered as an authentic witness to the traditions and practice of the apostles.<br>  <br>  In the existing documents that have come down to us, Ignatius is the first to use the word catholic in reference to the Church. On his way to Rome, under military escort to the Coliseum, where he would be devoured by lions for his faith, he wrote, "You must all follow the bishop as Jesus Christ follows the Father, and the presbytery as you would the apostles. Wherever the bishop appears, let the people be there; just as wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church" (Epistle to the Smyrnaeans 8).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Some non-Catholics teach that the Catholic Church did not even come into existence until the Emperor of Rome, Constantine, issued the "Edict of Milan"* in 313 A.D.. <br>  How then, can they explain this letter of Saint Ignatius written over 200 years earlier? <br>  Here is an additional sampling of titles of writings** where the Catholic Church is mentioned by name, and with all of them penned before 313 A.D.:<br>  <br>  Martyrdom of St. Polycarp 16:2. J77,79,80a,81a, 155 A.D. <br>  Clement of Alexandria, Stromateis 7:17:107:3. J435, 202 A.D. <br>  Cyprian, Letter to Florentius 66:69:8. J587, 254 A.D. <br>  Lactantius, Divine Institutions 4:30:1. J637, 304 A.D. <br>  <br>  *The "Edict of Milan", available on the Internet for all to see, did not "start" the Catholic Church, but merely allowed the open existence of Christianity. It allowed Christianity to continue without fear of Roman persecution. Prior to this event, Christians were persecuted mercilessly by both the Romans and the Jews, and they had to practice the faith underground, and in secret.<br>  Read the "Edict of Milan" for yourself and you will see the truth of what I said.<br>  **The "J" numbers refer to Jurgens book set, "The Faith of the Early Fathers". <br>  All of the writings listed above are available on the Internet for free. <br>  <br>  Saint Justin the martyr (105-165), is recognized as the "First Christian Apologist". <br>  He wrote extensively in the defense of the early Church. <br>  <br>  Saint Irenaeus (140-202), wrote a monumental volume entitled "Against Heresies" which scholars use to this day. Yes, there were heretics then also, and right from the very beginning of Christianity. <br>  <br>  Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea (263-339), is called, "The Father of Church History", and wrote 10 volumes of the history of the Catholic Church. His His-Storical writings span the time period from before the birth of Jesus Christ until about 330 A.D.. He quoted some of the writings of Josephus. <br>  <br>  Saint Athanasius (295-373), Bishop of Alexandria. Read about how he championed the Church against the heresy of Arianism. In his Festal Letter #39, which he wrote in 367, is a list of the New Testament Canon, which just a few years later was accepted by the Church. <br>  <br>  Saint Jerome (341-420), was the person who gave the world the first Bible with both Old and New Testaments, the "Latin Vulgate" in 404. The Vulgate is the official Bible of the Catholic Church to this day. Saint Jerome, as a great defender of the Catholic Church has many other outstanding writings to his credit. <br>  <br>  Saint Augustine (354-430), one of the greatest writers in defense of the Catholic Church of all time. He wrote hundreds of documents and mentioned the Catholic Church by name over 300 times. <br>  His "Confessions" is considered to be one of the|`|AA11724052	The Catholic church evolved from the teachings of Christ and the first pope was Peter the Apostle.|`|9BeUbORtaa	Clearly you have your own agenda to push on this one if you think there is a "correct" answer. <br>  <br>  If you mean the foundation of a distinctly Western and Latin Catholic Church (as opposed to the Greek Eastern Church) I'm going to go with the writing of St Augustine's "The City of God" around 410 AD.

Don't even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing out of the ordinary? Don't even the Gentiles do the same? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.<br>  <br>  Mat 6:2-4 So whenever you give to the poor, don't sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be applauded by people. I assure you you: They've got their reward! But when you give to the poor, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.<br>  <br>  Deut 15:10 Give to him, and don't have a stingy heart, when you give and because of this the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you do. for there will never cease to be poor people in the land; that is why I am commanding you, " You must willingly open your hand to your afflicted and poor brother in your land."<br>  <br>  Titus 3:1-11 REmind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to obey, to be ready for every good work, to slander no one, to avoid fighting, and to be kind, always showing gentleness to all people. For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, captives of various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, detesting one another. But when the goodness and love for man appeared from God our Savior he saved us not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to His mercy, through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit. This [Spirit] He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that haveing been justified by His grace, we may become heirs with the hope of eternal life. This saying is trustworthy. I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed God might be careful to devote themselves to good works. These are good and profitable for everyone. But avoid foolish debates, genealogies, quarrels, and disputes about law, for they are unprofitable and worthless. Reject a divisive person after a first and second warning, knowing that such a person is perverted and sins, being self-condemned.<br>  <br>  1 John 3:16-20 This is how we have come to know love: He laid down His life for us. We should also lay down our lives for our brothers. If anyone has this world's goods and sees his brother in need but shuts off his compassion from him-how can God's love reside in him? Little Children, we must not love in word or speech, but in deed and truth; that is how we will know we are of the truth, and will convince our hearts in His presence, becuase if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts and knows all things.<br>  <br>  Also read Mt: 25:32-46.|`|nYRkAmdtaa	Because somewhere in your religions history will be the persecution or war or mistrust of another or all other religions and that is deep rooted as it quite often resulted in the deaths of yours or the other or both .

Formerly, he was Professor of Ob-Gyn and the Chairman of the Department of Ob-Gyn at the University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. He was also the President of the American Fertility Society. He has received many awards, including the Association of Professors of Obstetrics and Gynecology Public Recognition Award in 1992. Professor Simpson studied the following two sayings of the Prophet Muhammad:<br>  “In every one of you, all components of your creation are collected together in your mother’s womb by forty days...”[2]<br>  “If forty-two nights have passed over the embryo, God sends an angel to it, who shapes it and creates its hearing, vision, skin, flesh, and bones....”[3]<br>  He studied these two sayings of the Prophet Muhammad extensively, noting that the first forty days constitute a clearly distinguishable stage of embryo-genesis. He was particularly impressed by the absolute precision and accuracy of those sayings of the Prophet Muhammad. Then, during one conference, he gave the following opinion:<br>  “So that the two hadeeths (the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad) that have been noted provide us with a specific time table for the main embryological development before forty days. Again, the point has been made, I think, repeatedly by other speakers this morning: these hadeeths could not have been obtained on the basis of the scientific knowledge that was available [at] the time of their writing . . . . It follows, I think, that not only there is no conflict between genetics and religion but, in fact, religion can guide science by adding revelation to some of the traditional scientific approaches, that there exist statements in the Quran shown centuries later to be valid, which support knowledge in the Quran having been derived from God.”<br>   <a href="http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/219/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/21...</a><br>  <br>  Hubble’s Law<br>  For thousands of years, astronomers wrestled with basic questions concerning the universe.

However, in 1912, the American astronomer, Vesto Slipher, made a discovery that would soon change astronomers’ beliefs about the universe. Slipher, noticed that the galaxies were moving away from earth at huge velocities. These observations provided the first evidence supporting the expanding-universe theory.[1]<br>  <br>  Before the invention of the telescope in 1608, man could do little more than wonder about the origin of the universe. (Courtesy: NASA)<br>  In 1916, Albert Einstein formulated his General Theory of Relativity that indicated that the universe must be either expanding or contracting. Confirmation of the expanding-universe theory finally came in 1929 in the hands of the well known American astronomer Edwin Hubble.<br>  By observing redshifts[2] in the light wavelengths emitted by galaxies, Hubble found that galaxies were not fixed in their position; instead, they were actually moving away from us with speeds proportional to their distance from earth (Hubble's Law). The only explanation for this observation was that the universe had to be expanding. Hubble’s discovery is regarded as one of the greatest in the history of astronomy. In 1929, he published the velocity-time relation which is the basis of modern cosmology. In the years to come, with further observations, the expanding-universe theory was accepted by scientists and astronomers alike.<br>  <br>  With the Hooker Telescope, Hubble discovered that the galaxies were moving away us. Above are photos of known galaxies. (Courtesy: NASA)<br>  Yet, astonishingly well before telescopes were even invented and well before Hubble published his Law, Prophet Muhammad used to recite a verse of the Quran to his companions that ultimately stated that the universe is expanding.<br>  “And the heaven We created with might, and indeed We are (its) expander.” (Quran 51:47)<br>  At the time of the revelation of the Quran, the word “space” was not known, and people used the word “heaven” to refer to what lies above the Earth. In the above verse, the word “heaven” is referring to space and the known universe. The verse points out that space, and thus the universe, happens to be expanding, just as Hubble’s Law states.<br>  That the Quran mentioned such a fact centuries before the invention of the first telescope, at a time when there was primitive knowledge in science, is considered remarkable. This is more so considering that, like many people in his time, Prophet Muhammad happened to be illiterate and simply could not have been aware of such facts by himself. Could it be that he had truly received divine revelation from the Creator and Originator of the universe?<br>  The Big Bang Theory<br>  Soon after Hubble published his theory, he went on to discover that not only were galaxies moving away from the Earth, but were also moving away from one another. This meant that the universe happened to be expanding in every direction, in the same way a balloon expands when filled with air. Hubble’s new findings placed the foundations for the Big Bang theory.<br>  The Big Bang theory states that around 12-15 billion years ago the universe came into existence from one single extremely hot and dense point, and that something triggered the explosion of this point that brought about the beginning of the universe. The universe, since then, has been expanding from this single point. <br>  Later, in 1965, radio astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson made a Noble Prize winning discovery that confirmed the Bing Bang theory. Prior to their discovery, the theory implied that if the single point from which the universe came into existence was initially extremely hot, then remnants of this heat should be found. This remnant heat is exactly what Penzias and Wilson found. In 1965, Penzias and Wilson discovered a 2.725 degree Kelvin Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) that spreads through the universe. Thus, it was understood that the radiation found was a remnant of the initial stages of the Big Bang. Presently, the Big Bang theory is accepted by the vast majority of scientists and astronomers.<br>  <br>  A microwave map of the leftover from the Big Bang that gave birth to the universe. (Courtesy: NASA)<br>  It is mentioned in the Quran:<br>  “He (God) is the Originator of the heavens and the earth…” (Quran 6:101)<br>  “Is not He who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the likes of them? Yes; and He is the Knowing Creator. His command is only when He intends a thing that He says to it, ‘Be,’ and it is.” (Quran 36:81-82)<br>  The above verses prove that the universe had a beginning, that God was behind its creation, and all that God needs to do inorder to create is to say “Be,” and it is. Could this be an explanation as to what triggered off the explosion that brought about the beginning of the universe?<br>  The Quran also mentions: <br>  “Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, then We separated them, and made from water every living thing? Then will they not believe?” (Quran 21:30)<br>  Muslim scholars who have explained the previous verse mention that the heavens and earth were once one, and then God caused them to separate and form into the seven heavens and Earth. Yet, due to the limitations of science and technology at the time of the revelation of the Quran (and for centuries to follow), no scholar was able to give much detail about how exactly the heavens and earth were created. What the scholars could explain was the precise meaning of each word in Arabic in the verse, as well as the overall meaning of the verse.<br>  In the previous verse, the Arabic words ratq and fataq are used. The word ratq can be translated into “entity” “sewn to” “joined together” or “closed up”. The meaning of these translations all circulate around something that is mixed and that has a separate and distinct existence. The verb fataq is translated into “We unstitched” “We clove them asunder” “We separated” or “We have opened them”. These meanings imply that something comes into being by an action of splitting or tearing apart. The sprouting of a seed from the soil is a good example of a similar illustration of the meaning of the verb fataq.<br>  With the introduction of the Big Bang theory, it soon became clear to Muslim scholars that the details mentioned with regards to the theory go identically hand in hand with the description of the creation of the universe in verse 30 of chapter 21 of the Quran. The theory states that all the matter in the universe came into existence from one single extremely hot and dense point; that exploded and brought about the beginning of the universe, matches what is mentioned in the verse that the heaven and Earth (thus the universe) where once joined together, and then split apart. Once again, the only possible explanation is that Prophet Muhammad had truly received divine revelation from God, The Creator and Originator of the universe.<br>  <a href="http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/1560/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/15...</a>|`|HlFzl1piaa	It's not really true if you read the versus they quote and claim to be true as per modern science, you would notice that they are in fact are twisting the meaning of the versus to suit science.|`|NmtHQyyYaa	I am a muslim and am simply quoting what i know....facts not opinions.<br>  honey was said to be antiseptic....and only recently scientists have discovered that it is.<br>  this is only a small discovery, there are many more about nature and space and the galaxies.<br>  i cannot quote verses to you, i have not memorized them but i know it because i have read it.<br>  the quran also quotes something along the lines of:<br>  and the Almighty's universe is ever expanding, remember this was in the time way before people thought the world was flat.<br>  there is much evidence in the scientific world that the universe IS ever <br>  expanding.<br>  <br>  thanks|`|R8yiNPfzaa	It is enough for you to see the debate between Dr. William Campbell and Dr. Zakir Naik "The Qur'an and the Bible in the light of Science" and you judge for yourself.

If you go on google scientists (atheists) have came up with logical interpretations of science related to the Quran.|`|uBxvR6FJaa	Claiming that the Quran contains scientific or mathematical miracles does not prove anything in and of itself. The idol-worshiping Greek, Roman, Aztec and Indian  people (along with MANY others) had literature, buildings, machines, medicine and ideas that seem “miraculous” to us today.<br>  <br>  Semen comes from between the backbone and the ribs (86:7). We need long, drawn-out explanations to try and explain this verse but are these “excuses” necessary for such a simple issue?<br>  <br>  The Quran says that nothing holds birds up in the sky except Allah (16:79, 67:19). Air is a physical substance. Flight is not magic, just ask the Wright brothers.<br>  <br>  Stars are located in the lowest “alssamai” or heaven (37:6). This is the same “alssamai” in which birds fly (16:79). According to the Quran, there is no difference between the atmosphere and outer space.<br>  <br>  Stars are missiles used to shoot at devils (37:6-8, 67:5). Shooting stars are rocky meteors, not stars.<br>  <br>  The Quran claims that there are no flaws in Allah’s sky (literally, there are no gaps 50:6). What about the holes in the O-Zone that let in deadly radiation? Most of the holes are natural, not man-made.<br>  <br>  The Quran says that the night “covers” or “veils” the day (7:54, 13:3, 91:4, 92:1). In reality, the “night” gets “covered” with a view-blocking “veil”, the blue sky of daytime.<br>  <br>  The mountains are “set firm” (79:32) and they prevent the Earth from shifting (16:15, 21:31). In reality, mountains are some of the fastest geological events and the location of most earthquakes. So, Allah created the Earth and then saw that His creation was flawed because it shook. He tried to fix it by creating quake-prone mountains that became some of the world’s most hostile living environments. Good job!<br>  <br>  Allah created everything in pairs (13:3, 43:12, 51:49). What about species that reproduce asexually?<br>  <br>  The Quran says that spiders have the weakest house (29:41). Super-strong spider web is a death-trap for insects. Is this one of its “weak” qualities? Spiders also live under rocks and in burrows - strong homes if you ask me. Some Muslims claim that the “weak house” term is referring to the spider’s poor family values. But there are animals who have worse families. Ants are born into slavery and end up working themselves to death for the queen. Bees are expected to sacrifice their lives for a colony with queen who might be an imposter. On the other hand, some female spiders will starve to death while protecting their egg-sack. Others will sacrifice their lives so that their children get one good meal. When it comes to spiders, we find that neither their home nor their family is considered “the worst”.<br>  <br>  Allah “sends thunderbolts and smites with them whom He pleases” (13:13). Is Allah is Zeus or Thor? Why does Allah allow man to redirect lightning with lightning rods? With metal rods, man gains the godlike power of determining lightning’s path? Lightning follows the path of least resistance, not Allah’s will. We have a scientific explanation for lightning - and it’s NOT magic!<br>  <br>  Does the “sinful hair” reference in verse 96:16 prove that the Quran knew that thoughts (sin) come from the brain? Why did Allah say “hair” when He really meant “brain”? Why not just say “brain” outright? Why don’t we assume that “hair” was referring to the scalp or scull? Verse 11:5 says that Allah knows what “thoughts are in your heart”. The Quran uses this “heart” term over 100 times. Are we to take this “thinking heart” metaphor laterally - or does “heart” mean “brain” as well? Verse 55:41 agrees that sinners will be “seized by the forelocks...” but adds “...and the feet”.

It might be $425 by the time you go.<br>  <br>  Years ago it used to be based on where you serve, my oldest brother served right as they were standardizing it and for good reason - he was in Chile where he needed about $28 per month, then my cousin went to Paris and my brother-in-law went to Japan where they would have been spending $2650 and $3200 per month had the church not standardized the costs.

I saved for my own mission, it feels great to be able to say and know that your hard work is part of the dedication that you need in your service,|`|6DmsiLGbaa	My brother is on a mission now, and I think we pay between $400-440 a month.  It was about the same when I served two years ago.  <br>  <br>  You don't need to worry about bills, though.  The way the missionary program works, every missionary pays the same amount, regardless of how expensive a particular mission is (the European missions are crazy expensive, but those who serve there will pay the same amount as a missionary living in the slums of South America).  In most areas, the mission office will then provide you with a credit card and will give you the amount of money it'll take to pay for your food and other expenses each month.  They'll take care of your utilities and such, because it's just easier than sending the money to the missionary and making them take time from God's work to pay bills.  It's also easier since the missionaries move around so much.  <br>  <br>  As for other expenses...well, to be honest, you'll need to save some extra money.  You'll have to buy clothing for your mission, which can cost quite a bit (especially if you're a girl), and you'll need to buy gear such as rain jackets, backpacks, luggage, ect.  It would also be a good idea to have some extra cash for when you're in the field, because when I was serving, the monthly allowance just wasn't quite enough.  (Women have to buy...ahem...certain feminine products, but the mission home only gave us four extra dollars a month for them.  That's not exactly enough.)  It's just better to be on the safe side, because even if you're male, things happen.<br>  <br>  Still, don't worry so much about the finances.  If you're going to serve, God will make it possible.  Do what you can to save money, and He'll make up the rest.  He always does.|`|AA11636949	it's about 5-6 thousand now. It also depends on how you spend it.

sXwBN5sSaa	"poco" means "little" in the sense of "not much": "Esta frase tiene poco sentido" - this sentence makes little sense"<br>  "corto" means "short" - (i.e. not long)<br>  "bajo" means "low" (or "short" when talking of a person's height, i.e. not tall)<br>  Peque?o means "not big", "small": a small house - una casa peque?a.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|2uwnRmxVaa	poco is a bit. as in el es un poco aburrido. (he is a bit bored)<br>  corto is short. as in su pelo es corto (his hair is short) or mangas cortas (short-sleeves)<br>  baja is short only in reference to a person. Ella es baja (she is short).<br>  pequeno is small as in small overall as in Natalia recibo un perro pequeno. (she recieved a small dog) <br>  <br>  hope that helps!|`|tjBkNe9Jaa	poco=few, corto=short, baja=short, pequeno=small, it does make a difference when u used them. for ex. like that dress is to little. ese traje es muy pequeno.      that custain is to short. esa cortina es muy corta.   hope i help at least a little.|`|YhDHQ0iOaa	Great answers from the other users, most of them will give you a full and detailed list of meanings.|`|jAdglgO9aa	It does matter on how you use some of them....<br>  <br>  Poco: a little, small amount<br>  <br>  Corto: Can be Short or Cut so that matters<br>  <br>  Baja: Short or To Lower<br>  <br>  Pequeno: Small|`|9vBqgoDfaa	poco = small amount<br>  corto = short length (usually horizontal)<br>  baja = short length (usually vertical) this can also be applied to grades or anything that could be measured vertically.<br>  peque?o = small in size<br>  <br>  Let's use them:<br>  Había poca harina<br>  Su pantalón era corto<br>  Era de baja estatura.<br>  El diamante era peque?o.<br>  <br>  * bajo is very variable and has more than 10 definitions|`|80841aafba2cedde2f2f011d05e695d2aa	the two previous answers are very complete, but I want to precise that "corto" applies for short length while "bajo" applies for short height. The latter applies not only for people but also for things: Puente bajo = Short bridge (not too tall) Puente corto = Short bridge (not too long).<br>  <br>  And another note: You can use "poco" both for countable things like in English "few" (Pocas manzanas = Few apples) but also for not countable things like "little" (Poco tiempo = little time).

NQ37mnWkaa	Well, since I could take your hand off at the wrist if you got too close...!<br>  Or rip your throat out...<br>  <br>  <br>  It rather depends on just which theories you believe in. For example :<br>  <br>  1) Not all varieties of Werewolf are limited to the full moon. Some can shift {in full or in part} whenever they want to.<br>  <br>  2) Who says silver bullets actually work? Maybe it was a myth the Werewolves started?<br>  <br>  3) Some Vampires are just like humans ~ walk around in daylight, eat food, sleep in beds, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  So, I'd say Vampires are easier to kill.|`|kTZevQNHaa	well since both are fantasial, it depends on the imagination of the one dreaming of such a feat.<br>  <br>  According to folklore- a werewolf takes the proverbial  silver bullet...that's easy enough to conjur up and also that I am magically a master marksman...so i'd say werewolf...tho i could kill 2 menacing fantasial characters in one fell swoop too should i care to fantasize that also. with all purpose werewolf/vampire spray--as fantasially advertised by billy mayes.|`|70OHpjySaa	I'm not that strong physically so I would make sure to catch either of them at their weakest moments. The werewolf when it's not a full moon and the vampire during daylight when he's sleeping in his coffin.<br>  <br>  I'd rather kill a vampire because a vampire, even sleeping, is still a vampire while a werewolf could be a nice person when he's not a werewolf.<br>  <br>  So, for me, the vampire would be easier to kill, no guilt there, oh! sorry, you forgot to put on sunscreen! What do you think of my garlic mashed potatoes that I brought you?|`|9q95w6vyaa	A warewolf if it's not time of the month. Otherwise vampire. Bit of garlic, dash of holy water, draw open the curtains to let the sun in and he's a gonner|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Depends- Vampires in particular tend to have notoriously shift weaknesses.  Probably werewolves... silver usually works and if you can get a few bullets made out of it, you're probably okay...|`|rJgrwIodaa	I've never attempted either, but I imagine I'd rather try to kill a vampire.  Werewolves have big fangs (even bigger than vampires), and I wouldn't want to get too close to those chops.  They also have extremely powerful, lithe bodies that would wreck a human.  If all I have to worry about with vampires is getting bitten on the neck, then they would have a pretty hard time getting past my silver sword...<br>  <br>  EDIT: Or would it be wooden sword?  Either way, wooden swords as just as deadly when the weilder knows how to swing them...|`|PmSDmkOvaa	Vampires are supposed to have Special powers like really fast and can jump really high and can shape shift and s.h.i.t... All a werewolf can do is scratch and bite you so i think it would be easier to kill a werewolf. Just shoot it with a silver bullet. Just watch the movie van helsing.|`|So1ROzM4aa	Werewolf I think. You could shoot a silver bullet from quite a distance but to plunge a steak into the heart of a vampire you'd have to be up close and personal, no thanks!|`|DCltkysDaa	Werewoflf most definately, you can even kill one with a food blender.|`|Cy9mMf4gaa	werewolf|`|vQouzFJXaa	from what i seen a lycan|`|qf5B4gZcaa	a vampire, just let the light shine on him:)|`|xOcfOy1vaa	thats a tough one. it depends on the type of werewolf or vampire. like in twilight it would be harder to kill the vamps then the werewolves but in underworld i think it would be easier to kill the vampire.

f43de8ca99b3b7c42f7d56cbdbc648b4aa	No, Satan can be redeemed<br>  <br>  1/ If the worst can receive redemption, everyone has hope<br>  2/ Originally Satan was a good angel created by God, but later fell. If something God creates fails, that makes God a failure as a creator. I don't believe God is a failure. Satan will stop being Satan and be redeemed.<br>  3/ Hell was not part of God's original plan. It is a *temporary place . Otherwise Heaven would not be perfect while looking at a place for eternity where others suffer.<br>  4/ "... Every knee shall bow ..." angels (fallen or heavenly) have knees too|`|Rn4GXoJAaa	Humans can only be saved because<br>  <br>  1. We were made in God's image<br>  2.

He hates God and he comes to destroy because he hates us. Jesus says a son is like his father, and theres a group here in R and S that seem to deny everything. Just saying.|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	Yep.

That answer's true for me, too.  Think about it - the Christian god makes the rules, so he is actually the punisher, therefore we have to accept jesus so god can "redeem" us from himself - EH????|`|cO8b7Pniaa	Yes, far beyond redemption. The bible says that (paraphrased) the only Unforgivable sin is continuous sin. Mark 3 and Matthew 12|`|AyPF2TFlaa	Satan is the embodiment of evil all evil comes from him he is the source as all good comes from God.<br>  NO Redemption.|`|TT0rCi8kaa	How could the Devil ever rule in Hell, were it not for the chance of Redemption?<br>  Anyway, its all fantasy.|`|FOZGMadaaa	Yes|`|T3g9Rzkjaa	A star for your question I have often wondered about that|`|AA11101434	Depends on your view of things. Equally is God beyond redemption to those who think and enjoy the flesh for its own sake? Surely that's what Satan is, ultimately - the perfect embodiment of those who use logic and argument and who refuse to have their natural desires stifled. Can God be redeemed to these people? If so, then presumably Satan can be redeemed to God.<br>  <br>  All of which of course is within the cat's cradle of a belief system, which I don't espouse, being an atheist.|`|AA10589243	When Satan rebelled against God's righteous rule he did so in full knowledge of what it meant.<br>  <br>  His actions were not by accident.<br>  <br>  As a perfect creature he cannot claim imperfection of any sort as an excuse for his actions.<br>  <br>  So he is deserving of the punishment that goes along with the crime , which is death.<br>  <br>  The same applies to both Adam and Eve , who were perfect in every way when they chose to follow Satan.<br>  Adam and Eve get no second chances through the resurrection.<br>  <br>  They too have received death as a penalty for their actions , and Satan too will meet exactly the same end as foretold in Genesis.<br>  <br>  <br>  For more Bible based information please feel free to email me.|`|AA10858522	Wow! There is no Satan. Its something to scare you. If you don't accept my religion my god will burn you up  and at the end of the world you will be in satan's army that will fight god's army with swords and horsies and for some reason god can't destroy satan even though he is the supreme being until this fight in which he will finally defeat satan. Wake up DUDE!|`|BlVO4UlNaa	Yep. But then again, only God knows us inside and out and everything we are going to do before we even do it, so He is the only one who knows what Satan's true intentions are and whether or not he is worthy of redemption.|`|m6PnfBvOaa	It's a hopeless question since in reality, there really is no satan.  No god either.|`|mFGyonmTaa	I don't see why...<br>  <br>  After all, he's not the only entity in history to rebel against religion...

It will take some time for you to get over her and sometimes you wont get over it but that's OK.  Don't feel bad for wanting to get into another relationship.  I have done the same thing.  Just because people break up doesn't always mean that they stop caring for each other.  Just try to be strong.  I know that things are hurting right now but time heals all wounds and if it was really meant to be then you guys will be back together.  Nothing is wrong with you still missing her.  That is normal.  I wish you the best of luck with everything and I hope that everything works out for you.

dFBccLExaa	The best spell is ALWAYS the one that you write yourself. Your energy gets worked into the very core of the spell because you took the time to make it. It becomes much more powerful because you've invested time into it.   There are plenty of spells that you can create on your own that aren't complicated. People have a knack for thinking that hte more complicated the spell, the better it works, but I can attest that that isn't the case. All of the spells I've done have been super simple, and I usually have success.

This can be a really great fun experience.|`|8Pro95Izaa	Is that what you think that all the actions are for? I think that before you start writing your own spell you understand the uses for your chosen ingredients.     The power behind the spell is everything included. While the main tool is yourself you can use other items. Say for instance you will be using a candle, then you will pick a color that vibrates to the energy you will be using.       Spell by me :)  Shadow Storm   May your valentines be great ^_^  Red can be for passion while pink can be for a pure love.   Cinnamon incense for love and rose petals for the same thing.   each of those has an energy that is helpful towards your goal and they will help you attain your desire. The spell is supposed to also have an effect on your psycologically. To change your way of thinking because if you keep thinking you are not going to find love then you are not going to find it (see Law of Attraction).     Then as each ingridient lends it's energy to the spell, at this time the things you do during the working will help raise energy, personal and otherwise. All energy will have the same goal in the end. Once you release it, you need only wait. So no, the main thing is not to remove doubt because if you do not belive in it, then you're not going to create change. Any magick that you raise will only be canceled out with not believeing.       I have a fresh new love spell for Valentine's day that I just created not so long ago...    Items needed:    1) Red Candle  2) Pink Candle  3) Red Rose (optional)  4) Needle or Knife (to carve candle)  5) Lighter  6) Cinnamon incense (optional)    1) Take red candle and draw interlocked Gender symbols that are appropriate for you. then place the candle down. 2) Then take up the pink candle and draw a heart on it. Put it down three inches away from the red one. 3) Now place the Rose before both candles and ready yourself to recite the following:     Aphrodite my queen, join me in this hour  Bless me this (night/day) and lend me your power.  *Red to bring lust that burns strong like a fire*  *Pink to draw love, my true hearts' desire.*  Bring me a partner, for this I pray  on this most sacred Valentine's day.   With harm to none, this spell is done.  Let it be so!    Candles can be lit right before you read the prayer or you may light them as you read out the color of the candle (which are the lines between the *)    Let the candles burn down entirely, but if you must turn them off simply snuff them out and re-light them when you are ready to do so and read again the prayer provided. If no rose is available, then leave it out. Rose petals work well too, simply spread them in a circle around the candles.     ____________________________    this can be done at any time during V-Day.            You can use incense if you want (Cinnamon). Light it before you start everything else and let it burn down all the way.     Already many ask me what this is for: This spell is to help bring Love (Romantic love especially) into your life. If you already have a partner and would like to do this working together then use the following spell:    Aphrodite my queen, join us this hour  Bless Us this (night/day) and lend Us your power.  *Red to bring lust that burns strong like a fire*  *Pink to draw love, Our true hearts' desire.*  Bless Us today, for this I pray  on this most sacred Valentine's day.   With harm to none, this spell is done.  Let it be so!    Both of you recite this together and you should light the candles together by using an Incense stick (Cinnamon). Or two lighters but this can be dangerous.|`|1w2qIXmyaa	Yeah it works better. Because it was from the real inside of you. And your inner spirit works with the spell. It responds more than spells from book or something.|`|1wNsBNmxaa	well fun girl all i have to say about your love spell question is why are you going to make someone or somebody new fall for you with you when they really are not in love with you in the first place why mess with somebody life in you can not get somebody to fall in love with you the right way just leave it along cause you will be messing with something that later on in life will bite you in the butt in the long run    you are doing the spell for somebody new to come in your life if you can not meet a person the right way in life for that new person to get to know you for who you are then all i have to say to you is good luck with that cause you are messing with something you truly do not understand is that how you are going to make somebody new in your life is to make them like you by doing spells on people cause you truly don't have it all together with your self     in i never ever said any thing about you falling back in love with somebody else you were in love with you said this not me read my answer the right way not by putting words in my mouth i did not say this at all (someone or somebody new fall for you)     D?mon~~?
IFQFt25naa	I happen to be outside the USA.  <br>  <br>  Where I am located the tax system is very different.<br>  <br>  I have tried to explain the US Federal Income Tax system and all the paper work everyone has to file even if you didn’t make a penny.<br>  <br>  A lot of people here think I am making the whole thing up, especially the penalties for not filing even if the person didn’t make a anything.  What really makes them believe that I am just making it up is when I tell them what all I really went through with a tax audit because of a mistake that the IRS auditors made (not my mistake).<br>  <br>  They tell me that they know I am making the stories up or exaggerating because “they know” the US government is not that chaotic or unfair.  <br>  <br>  So because the people here think the I am making up the stories of the IRS does that mean that the organization does not exist?  Or if any of the people here ever move to and work in the USA that they will not have to file and pay the taxes?  To the people here, right now, the stories of the IRS are a myth or an exaggeration, and it does not matter how many people tell them about the organization, they simply do not believe what we say.  It will not be until they "cross over" to the USA that they see and understand for themselves the realities of what we have told them.<br>  <br>  There have been doubters of God’s existence since the Old Testament days.  Even some of them said that all the god’s were myths and superstitions, but somehow unlike the other gods, one “non-existent” God just keeps being very persistent about not going away.   Could that mean anything?<br>  <br>  Just something to think about.<br>  <br>  May Our Creator watch over you and your family.|`|T3g9Rzkjaa	I currently am reading, The Case For Christ, It is by and Athesist (Lee Strobel) that becomes a belirver that was trying to prove that there was no God|`|NiDWAkf0aa	See... it's obvious isn't it... there is no hell and there is no heaven.

They were even willing to give their life to testify to the message in the book. Although he was not a king and not worthy of any historians attention; a few ancient historians did mentioned His existence and that He is not a fairly tale. A Roman government official by the name of Plini even testified that he executed many of His followers but His followers, who heard His message from the eyewitnesses, found it so convincing that they would rather die that deny Him. And these evidence are even available today. Would you consider believing ?<br>  <br>  Someone else mentioned Lee Strobel. His wife was an atheist and converted to Christianity. He wanted to disprove the claims of the resurrection; and researched about the accuracy of the gospels. He came back a believer.<br>  <br>  Just take a look at the first few sentence that Luke (a well-educated Greek physician) wrote in his letter:<br>  <br>  Luke 1:<br>  1Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled[a] among us, 2just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 3Therefore, ***since I myself have carefully investigated everything*** from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 4so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.<br>  <br>  Luke made it clear he was not writing a fiction. Luke traveled with Paul and he was an eyewitness to Paul's deeds. As a learned physician, he was the right person in the right place to tell us (skeptics) what really happened. This physician wrote that he saw Paul revive a death person:<br>  <br>  Acts 20:<br>  9Seated in a window was a young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on. When he was sound asleep, he fell to the ground from the third story and was picked up dead. 10Paul went down, threw himself on the young man and put his arms around him. "Don't be alarmed," he said. "He's alive!" <br>  <br>  The following webpage testifies to the historical accuracy of Luke's writing:<br>  <br>      <a href="http://www.ichthus.info/Luke/intro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ichthus.info/Luke/intro.html</a><br>  <br>  So there are evidence for the case for Christ. Christians (at least, some) do not believe in the resurrected Christ with "blind faith". Especially the disciple of Jesus: they started Christianity and if anyone knew if the message was a lie, it would be them. They were willing to die for the message. No sane man will willingly give up his own life for a message that they knew was a lie (they should know, since they were the one who **started**  the message, Christianity was not started by Jesus: He has already left). <br>  <br>  Just like members in a jury hearing the same evidence will render a different verdict, each of us will decide differently. Our choice will carry consequences (that is true for every choice we make). God will honor the choice each one of us makes because God will not force anyone to be with Him if he/she doesn't want to.

6ELSwKKvaa	There are beliefs about the texts that are in the Bible about same sex behavior that look at those passages in their context. I can share them all with you but it would need to be done by e-mail and you have yours blocked from getting mail from Y!A answers. I will do my best to condense the contextual meanings of these passages.<br>  <br>    Sodom and Gomorrah were not as much about homosexuality as it was  unspecified sexual sins and inhospitality. It says all the men, young and old, showed up to have sex with these men. We can assume that the entire city was not homosexual by nature. It was common in that time to have a male on male rape to humiliate and feminize a foe. The towns people likely thought these men were spies from another city and viewed them as a threat. Their plans were to have sex with them, humiliate them and send them back to their town afraid to tell anyone anything about their town. This is not like the homosexuality we know today. Personally I do not believe that it is wrong for a same sex couple to have a monogamous loving relationship with one another. You shouldn't however have sex with someone until you have a lifelong commitment with them. (Same as a hetero married couple)<br>  <br>   Other times that same sex behavior is mentioned in the Bible is likely due to pagan worship of fertility gods. Paul in his roaming's was likely to come across orgies being performed to please the fertility gods of other nations. When he mentioned these same sex acts, I believe he was referring to people who's natural orientation was not for a member of the same sex but to those who practiced idol worship by having sexual relations that were unnatural for them.<br>  <br>    There are two different views on these passages. My advice to you is that you learn as much as you can about the Bible and God and Love God and then decide for yourself which version you believe to be true. If you accept the version directly as it appears in the Bible without looking into the context of what these writers were talking about, it might come down to you deciding to be celibate. If you understand and accept the contextual meanings of these texts then it is in your best interest to have a loving relationship and pick a life partner and be married in God's eyes.<br>  <br>   Either way know that God loves you very much and wants the best for you!  <br>  <br>   If you unblock your e-mail and want to have a conversation about these texts, I will write you back. Just click on my picture and it will take you to my profile page and then click e-mail. I will get back to you as soon as possible.|`|43df0b4a9c6483ef52c3528781726646aa	You are certainly following the correct religion ..You will find many who will help you in the church hierarchy.|`|wcOq60Hhaa	The easy answer is to do what I did -- stop being a Christian.<br>  <br>  Not being snarky -- just realistic -- no religious community is universally, generally supportive of the gay community or gay people and some are, of course, down right evil to us.  Most gay people (1) find their own religion, (2) find a particular church that welcomes and embraces homosexuality as "normal", (3) reject religion out right, (4) embrace atheism/agnosticism (me), or (5) hide within the general religious community.<br>  <br>  Just don't be a (5).|`|OuMhera8aa	Know that God wants to be in relationship with everyone, according to the Bible. That means that even if you have turned away or denied God, your creator wants you back. Understand that Christians have a range of beliefs about the Bible and many other issues, as well as about homosexuality. For example, fundamentalists believe that every word in the Bible is from God and that it contains no mistakes, but many other Christians believe that the Bible was written by people who sometimes made mistakes. Look for condemnations of gays and lesbians by Jesus, and you'll find that he never spoke about the issue - or if he did, it wasn't recorded. Read Ezekiel 16:48-50 for one view of how to interpret the story of Sodom. This passage says that the "sin of Sodom" was that its citizens were prideful and had a lot of food but did not help the needy. Count the number of verses in the Bible that you think condemn homosexuality, and you'll find that they're a very small part of the Bible. Some people think that if God condemned gays and lesbians, the Bible would be clearer about it. Notice that some verses may condemn certain sex acts, but they never explicitly condemn being gay or lesbian. Some people believe that these verses were meant only to condemn certain people who were doing the wrong things, in the wrong places and at the wrong times. Keep in mind that eating shellfish and handling pigskin are prohibited in Leviticus 18, the same chapter that says it's wrong for men to "lie with men." Taken to an extreme, a literal belief in this chapter could mean that it's an abomination, punishable by death, to play football or eat shrimp. Listen to the words of Jesus in John 3:16. He says that whosoever believes in him will have life everlasting, and many of the Bible stories about Jesus suggest that he never intended anyone to be excluded from "whosoever." Continue to explore the Christian faith by visiting a gay-friendly or gay-led church. You'll find many independent gay churches, but about 300 around the world are affiliated with the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches (see mccchurch.org). These churches may help you think through your questions about being a gay Christian.|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	You can be a gay and Christian.

It's people who hate and question gay orientation, not God.  Be proud of being both a Christian and gay.  And, if you're not going already, attend a nondenominational Christian church.  They are accepting of people being - human.|`|QjgxH7Ouaa	Jesus loves you.  Don't believe these crazy (and I do mean crazy) people who will tell you that you have to choose between God and being gay.  In the Bible it says that girls with short hair are prostitutes.  Well, I have short hair.  It also says that if you call someone a fool you'll burn in hell.  I'm not saying that the Bible isn't true.  What I am saying is that you know in your heart that you love Jesus and have accepted him as your Savior.  You can NEVER be taken away from his hand.  You can NOT lose your salvation.  Do not listen to people who want to judge you.  THEY ARE THE PEOPLE JESUS WAS PREACHING AGAINST!  Jesus didn't hang around the rich, proper people of the world.  He was with sinners!  With us!<br>  <br>  Keep the faith.  Find a church that you feel comfortable with.  And don't assume if they are rude to you that it's because you're gay.  It could be because of your looks or your car or anything else.  <br>  <br>  We were in a new church the other day and 2 women wouldn't speak to me.  I even said, "hello" and smiled.  They completely ignored me.  Ya know what that told me?  To stay away from them and not to let them keep me away from worshipping my Lord in the church that I want to!!  They aren't gonna keep me from Praising Him and I hope that idiots won't keep you from attending any church you want to!  You have every right to be there!|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Well, the position of the 'nicer' Christian communities tends to be that there's nothing wrong with being attracted to the same sex- that's how God made you- but actually acting on that is a sin.  Basically, look but don't touch.<br>  <br>  Many, of course, also feel that what you do is between you and God, and that there can be nothing wrong with true love, whatever form it takes.<br>  <br>  But sadly, there are others who will quote Leviticus and tell you that being homosexual is immoral and you should 'stop'.  Personally, I don't think anyone can change who or what they are attracted to.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, it's up to you to decide what you believe in.  Good luck.|`|24W08urlaa	Ok you absolutely do not need to choose between God or Gay, that is a lie. There are many churches that accept gay people, and many priests and ministers as well.

So it can't be wrong to be gay since that was the way you were made.  And God doesn't make mistakes.  <br>  <br>  Just be yourself.  Be confident in your faith.  That's all that matters.

2Sxhtuv0aa	In the same way that French, Italian and Spanish are Romance or Romantic languages, meaning they all come from the Latin (Rome), English is a Germanic language.  It has to do with the origins of the languages.<br>  Germanic Languages<br>  subfamily of the Indo-European family of languages, spoken by about 470 million people in many parts of the world, but chiefly in Europe and the Western Hemisphere. All the modern Germanic languages are closely related; moreover, they become progressively closer grammatically and lexically when traced back to the earliest records. This suggests that they all derive from a still earlier common ancestor, which is traditionally referred to as Proto-Germanic and which is believed to have broken from the other Indo-European languages before 500 Although no writing in Proto-Germanic has survived, the language has been substantially reconstructed by using the oldest records that exist of the Germanic tongue.|`|9SSO454taa	English people come from tribes in Germany called the anglos and saxons they are what you called germeric, the name England come from the name Anglo . the English flag is white with a red cross, German flag is white also , the English language is very close to the german language but dont get England mixed up with Wales or Scotland and Ireland they are called celts they come from more spain italy france that area of the map.

Whether or not you are a simply common man to the most educated man it is senseless.<br>  <br>  Please read this for your own education: <br>  <br>  Source of information about Jesus in Christianity<br>  <br>  Christians take their information about Jesus from the Bible, which includes the Old and New Testaments.<br>  <br>  These contain four biblical narratives covering the life and death of Jesus. They have been written, according to tradition, respectively by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. They are placed at the beginning of the New Testament and comprise close to half of it. <br>  <br>  ENCYLOPEDIA BRITANICA<br>  notes that none of the sources of his life and work can be traced to Jesus himself; he did not leave a single known written word. Also, there are no contemporary accounts written of his life and death. What can be established about the historical Jesus depends almost without exception on Christian traditions, especially on the material used in the composition of the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke, which reflect the outlook of the later church and its faith in Jesus.<br>  <br>  For more information go to the source.|`|0vmQNf0oaa	Because you are an atheist, incapable of understanding the Bible.<br>  <br>  Those of us who have the Spirit are not spiritually dead and the Spirit reveals his Word to us.

spbqfjvbaa	Sometimes.  It depends on the couple.  I had a couple where I got along great with the guy, & the girl was cute.  The girl one night got me kinda tipsy & asked if I would be interested in a 3some with her & her boy.  I freaked out & went to the guy (we were good friends) & told him that I didn't want to mess up anything between the 3 of us, but his girl wasn't getting the hint that I wouldn't sleep with her (since they were together) & wouldn't sleep with him because I don't go that way.<br>  <br>  Yeah, pretty awkward.

I met a guy one time that took me to his place and his wife was waiting there to join in. I left in a hurry.|`|mwEBrwlOaa	It does happen especially where the couple is looking for a single woman for a fmf. Reason being there are more males available and the couple does not have to look far to find a male that is interested. Whereas the number of unattached females interested in having a threesome is much lower and this means for a couple that they have to become more open minded about where they search for an interested female. The logic behind going to a gay bar is if they look for someone who is bisexual it means that they would be interested in having sex with the both of them. However that logic is somewhat flawed due to the fact that if they were bisexual and wanted to have sex with a couple they would be at a straight bar, not a gay bar. <br>  <br>  With that said I would suspect their success rate is quite low as most women who attend gay bars are more interested in finding a woman than a man or couple. So if a couple was successful at a gay bar most likely it would be a bisexual situation where the other took more of a voyeur role than an active participant role.|`|92a39160b5f170df4b5ef1729f3b2395aa	I went to a gay club on valentine's day, I normally go to the same club on weekends, and I had never seen so many seemingly straight couples.

jcL7gDMKaa	you are not alone there. I have been having the same problem. What pisses me off is at the interviews they ask all these OTHER questions which has no basis on the actual duties of the job Im interested in. I guess there must be so many applications so maybe that's the only way they can narrow down the numbers of candidates. Its still annoying though, I have a MA plus other college qualifications and Im having to also apply for poxy office jobs paying ￡13,000 or less when I would normally expect ￡17,000 at a minimum. Its really unfair, my friend says I should just lie and tell them what they want to hear, but I don't even KNOW what they want to hear, all these questions are completely random and open-ended.|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	There is just something about you they did not like and it will do no good to try and find out because they have no obligation to tell you.I know I have not been selected for jobs in my field because I'm too honest and I can do nothing about it,except become dishonest.|`|WaTj4XBqaa	Ahh bless you, I think you can  ask them, when you have calmed down a bit.<br>  <br>  Perhaps they not good at choosing people that well,  as obviously other person has left in a month>>>>> or maybe you should forget them as they would not be good employers thats why last person left so quick!<br>  <br>  Anyway I wish you the best in the future!|`|CDRjggikaa	As much as we may disagree,management's decisions are final Not necessarily right,but still final.<br>   Keep your chin up,keep looking,and good luck|`|v1uNUcwCaa	im going thru this all the time at the moment its heartbreaking and you lose trust in companys.<br>  <br>  im just trying to get a part time job in a restaurant type envoironment. you would think that would be easy since i have nearly 2 years of constant employment in a similar role... but no it isnt at all.<br>  <br>  just take it how it is. <br>  they are a company who dont give a **** about experience or where a person lives or they wouldve employed you<br>  maybe you interview too well. <br>  maybe you have too much experience and they are worried that you will take over the office.<br>  maybe they wanted someone to train up a bit.<br>  maybe they just wanted someone for temporay role and would prefer to employ you permanantly.<br>  or maybe they employed the good looking model type who didnt really want the job but went for it anyway, you would be suprised how often this happens...
xF8TvlhYaa	As per science also,every man has XY chromosomes.So the idea that Eve was made from Adam's rib is symbolic of showing that man and women are inseparable.Every man has some women in him.In Hindu custom(one school) God is conceived as Super Man.All the lives on earth(both male and female) are considered as female only.The idea is these 'Jeevatmas'(entire humanity) are to embrace the' purusha'-God-Super Man!|`|AA11849917	Your question doesn't really make a whole lot of sense.

Eve was put on this Earth so that Adam would have a mate. Although Adam took from the tree of "The Knowledge of Good and Evil" and God,  kicked them out of the Garden from taking the fruit from the tree after he told them not too, I tend to think that the phrase,"It's the Womans fault" is where this comes from.

When we earn money we have the fear of loosing it (again going through hardship to keep it secured)<br>  3. Money blinds us and fails to distinguish between a woman who loves you or your money.<br>  4. Our children become extension of our ego and they too are spoilt by the money.<br>  5.

God gives and he takes away.Blessed be the name of the Lord.<br>  <br>  God is concerned with Salvation of mankind a change of heart and mind.

The flesh wants the security of money. It wants to be in control, to be master, to "be god". So we dream of and cling to money because we don't want to be totally dependent on God...<br>  Job 31:24-25,28 (NIV) [Job:] "If I have put my trust in gold or said to pure gold, 'You are my security,' if I have rejoiced over my great wealth, the fortune my hands had gained... then these also would be sins to be judged, for I would have been unfaithful to God on high."<br>  <br>  James 1:9-11 (Phi) The brother who is in need may be proud because God has raised him to the true riches. The rich may be proud that God has shown him his spiritual poverty... Just as surely will the rich man and his ways fall into the blight of decay<br>  <br>  Money is not the root of all evil. The Bible says, "The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows" (I Timothy 6:10). The use of money can be very worthwhile. It can be used to build orphanages and hospitals, to feed the poor, to preach the gospel, to build universities, to educate people in righteousness, to establish churches, and to broadcast the gospel. It takes money to print Bibles, to publish religious books, and to advertise evangelistic meetings. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with money. <br>  <br>  The question is what is money being used for? Is it being used for God's glory, or is it being used only for pleasure? Is it being used for pride, to support dictators, and for the purchase of arms with which to kill people, or is it being used for a higher purpose? <br>  <br>  The love of money is a root of evil, because some people love money more than they love God. Jesus said man cannot serve God and Mammon (the false god of riches and avarice) see Matthew 6:24.|`|mhdwOSXBaa	God is superior to everything & everyone, period. <br>  <br>  God should mean more to everyone alive than anything else in this world, whether your job or family.

Sir/Madam should help though, sometimes the British are either formal or just like to be treated highly when they go out.  As far as the speaking, could you repeat that, Sir/Madam?  And lean in a little to show that you're struggling to understand.<br>  <br>  British people are kind of like New Yorkers in that they're self-absorbed - not in a bad way but it's just how it is over there.|`|FLAtdWrmaa	Answerers Linnea Quigley and Pointz are being nasty little boors to you.  Try not to take their abusive answers personally.<br>  <br>  You don't say where you and your customers are.  What part of the world you are in changes the etiquette somewhat.<br>  <br>  You also don't say what kind of place you and these customers are in.  It sounds like you are all in a club, or hotel, or restaurant, where food and drinks are served.<br>  <br>  I can't understand your customers' problem with the water service:  perhaps they expect you to put the empty glass on the table, and pour the water from a pitcher (jug) into the glass? Ask your boss for help. <br>  <br>  If you serve water the way your boss says to, and the customers still make odd faces, ask them politely if there is a problem.  They should be able to tell you what the problem is. We hope they will tell you politely.  Perhaps it is as simple as the water is too warm and they want ice, or that there is a smudge on the glass, or something like that.  These problems are easy to solve.  <br>  <br>  But then again, perhaps the face-making comes from something else, such as from the conversation at the table, and has nothing at all to do with your service or the water-glass.<br>  <br>  As for accents:  yes, it would be offensive to tell them their English accent is too thick, if English is their native language.  It is especially offensive if you and they are in an English-speaking country.  (It is much less offensive if you are in an Asian-speaking country.)<br>  <br>  Regional accents, however, can give the imperfect-English speaker many problems:  for example, if you are in London, and if you are just getting used to hearing London accents, it may be hard for you to try to understand a customer speaking English with a Scottish accent.<br>  <br>  Your best solution to preventing mis-understanding is to say to the speaker, "I am so sorry, my English is not very good yet, so I did not understand you clearly.  Could you please repeat what you said, but more slowly?  I want to be sure I take your order correctly."  <br>  <br>  This also works with customers who speak too fast.<br>  <br>  This way, you make your problem sound like *your* problem. You are not blaming the customer, and you really want to help the customer.  You are telling the customer that he or she can get what they really want by helping you with this problem as you ask.  And this way, nobody needs to be offended.<br>  <br>  Very impatient customers might be offended, anyway.  All you can do then is be patient, and stay polite to the customer.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you.  And good luck!|`|b146bf3f7e2e162a7266cd68a0222d22aa	British customers like politeness, however they can be rude sometimes as well.  If someone asks for a water, make sure and ask would anyone else like a drink.  If someone else wants a glass of water then its normally nice to give them empty glasses and a Jug of water.  Always place on the table next to their place mats.<br>  <br>  As for you understanding a thick English accent, just say "I am sorry I am still getting used to a wide variety of English accents, would you mind repeating yourself thankyou?"<br>  <br>  Even some British born find it difficult to understand some others.|`|jx9YnFV8aa	Simply being polite about serving customers is the number one rule in my book. You should never serve water by handing the full glass to the customer or filling the glass as they hold it. If they request something, respond as quickly as possible and ask for them to clarify their request if you do not understand.<br>     Good servers ask from time to time how things are and are always attentive to the customer's needs. A customer should never have to ask for something unless it is out of the ordinary. There are always exceptions, like you are very busy serving other customers. The best way to handle the situation is to be friendly and get back with  customers as often as possible and let them know by your attentiveness that they are getting more than they asked for. <br>    Service is just as important as the menu or how an item is prepared or presented.How well you conduct yourself and perform those tasks that are within your power to control will keep customers coming back and more than not generate a well deserved tip for your efforts. I sincerely hope this helps.|`|OHqjrNCJaa	who cares. just give them the water, and if they make a face tell them.

"Could you please repeat that" if you didn't understand their accent...

wB3AbJyLaa	Despite all the books calling Christians to provide proofs for their beliefs, you won't see philosophers doing so, not even the most atheistic. The great majority that that strong rationalism is nearly impossible to defend. To begin with, it can't live up to its own standards. How could you empirically prove that no one should believe something without empirical proof? You can't and that reveals it to be, ultimately, a belief. Strong rationalism also assumes that it is possible to achieve the view from nowhere, a position of almost complete objectivity, but virtually all philosophers today agree that is impossible. We come to every individual evaluation with all sorts of experiences and background beliefs that strongly influence our thinking and the way our reason works. It is not fair, then, to demand an argument that all rational people would have to bow to. The philosopher Thomas Nagel is an atheist, but in his book "The Last Word" he admits that he can't come to the question of God in anything like a detached way. He confesses that he has fear of religion, and he doubts anyone can address this issue without very powerful motives for seeing the arguments go one way or the other. "I am thinking of... the fear of religion itself. I speak from experience, being strongly subject to this fear myself: I want atheism to be true.... It isn't just that I don't believe in God and, naturally, hope that I'm right in my belief. It's that I hope there is no God! I don't want there to be a God: I don't want the universe to be like that.... I am curious whether there is a God. Anyone who, whatever his actual belief about the matter, doesn't particularly want either one of the answers to be correct."|`|AA11212224	Zeitgeist.<br>  <br>  Need I say more?  Zeitgeist is moronic, and the people who created it are every bit as dishonest as Kent Hovind/Dr. Dino.<br>  <br>  Now MOST atheists recognize that Zeitgeist is dishonest, just as MOST Christians recognize that evolution does not disprove the existence of God.  But some atheists still try to use it.<br>  <br>  Another stupid argument:  "Can God create a *noun* so *adjective* that He couldn't *verb*?"  <br>  <br>  Christians have "drinking" questions from atheists, too.  :)|`|rVPrhd26aa	atheists and evolutionists are two completely different things man...<br>  atheists don't believe in evolution and if they do then they are evolutionists who don't know how to properly define their religion.<br>  that's like saying the Jewish religion is the same as Christian because their book starts the same.

Ow6lKFXiaa	Regarding the rainbow analogy made above...it makes a point but with one gaping flaw...there is scientific evidence for rainbows, both their cause and existence.  There is neither for creationism. <br>   <br>  Children are taught to believe in Santa, and they truly believe and suffer depression, feelings of betrayal, anger and other emotions when they find out he's a story we made up.  The widely accepted version of the God stories are so ingrained, it's nearly impossible to give it up.  <br>  <br>  People have a desperate need to believe there is more to life than what we see.  A desperate need for a Prince Charming, a Superman, a Hero to rescue us from the pains we suffer and see around us.  This need is part of our humanity and always will be.  That's why God-like beings, both good and evil, have been part of human culture since the time we gained the ability to think.  We needed a way to explain WHY? and we still do.  Everyone chooses the way most suited to them.<br>    <br>  But ask yourselves this:  Does poking out your own eyes to avoid seeing the rainbows change the fact that they exist?  No.  And neither does closing your eyes to the proof of evolution change the fact that it exists.  It’s the same as the old riddle “If a tree falls in the forest and there’s no one to hear, does it make a sound?”  Of course it does.  You can plug up your ears to avoid hearing the sound, but proof of the sound still exists…animal will startle, birds will fly, vibrations will be felt, and evidence of the fall will be left – broken branches, impact crater, soil disturbance, and so on.<br>  <br>  Creationists are hopeful, desperately grasping to make sense of it all in a way that has meaning to them.  That's something we all do.   Unfortunately, yes, some of them are liers, twisting things in anyway possible to make their belief fit and to convince others they are right at any cost.  I personally don't believe in creationism the way it’s stated in the bible nor do I believe in an all powerful, humanized giant with a long beard, big feet and clipboard sitting on a throne of gold checking off yes or no to prayers and a nice and naughty list of who goes to heaven and hell.<br>  <br>   True, there will always be the question of the origin of the universe.  I don't think that question will ever be answered.   I see and understand the belief in Intelligent Design but not in Creationism… that humans were just “Poofed” into existence in our present form.  Evolution has more proof than we know what to do with and more comes every day.|`|9BeUbORtaa	Put it this way: I don't think they're disingenuous.

They simply regard evolution as too horrible to consider.<br>  That's understandable perhaps. If you have been brought up to believe that the world was created by a loving being (not examining too closely all the death and destruction in the OT) who watches over everything and one day will come down and sort out all the injustices, then some people come along and say, no, actually we are the end product of millions of years of unguided struggle, death, starvation, disease, pain and the elimination of the weak, and probably noone is going to come and help us. That's quite something to get your head around. Many do not even try. Instead they build a wall in their mind and put evolution on the other side of it.<br>  That is also the reason that when creationists argue against evolution they usually argue against some cartoon version of it ("If we evolved from monkeys"...etc.), because they are not prepared to let the whole terrible concept into their minds for full consideration.|`|AA11849917	Are atheists liars, or just silly?<br>  <br>  Your question is both arrogant and presumptuous and doesn't even deserve an answer.  Let ME ask YOU a question: "Do you close the living room curtains before you sexually abuse your children?"  Both questions are nonsense - mine AND yours - but especially yours.  <br>  <br>  But I will give you a little story that may help you understand things a little.<br>  <br>  There was a small village near some waterfalls, and because of the waterfalls, rainbows were a regular occurrence.<br>  <br>  There was a man in the village who, for some obscure reason, hated rainbows, but tolerated them.<br>  <br>  Every once in a while a double rainbow forming a full circle would appear, and when one appeared, all the children would run to everybody in the village to tell them to come outside to look at the double rainbow.<br>  <br>  The man who hated rainbows finally got sick and tired of people telling him about the double rainbows, so he poked his eyes out.<br>  <br>  The next time someone came by to tell him that there was a double rainbow in the sky, he told them that rainbows don't exist.<br>  <br>  The man (an adult, this time) asked him how he could possibly say that.  The rainbow hater said that he can't see any rainbows, and therefore they don't exist.<br>  <br>  "There is none so blind as he who refuses to see."<br>  <br>  And like you, "I once was blind, but now I see."<br>  <br>  Sorry, but all the silly, liars who call themselves scientists are as blind as you.<br>  <br>  Jesus said that if you REALLY want to know if God is real, then "OBEY  THESE  COMMANDS, and you shall know."  (I believe He was talking about the Sermon on the Mount, starting in the 5th chapter of the gospel according to Matthew.)<br>  <br>  God said, "If you seek for me, then you shall find me, if you search for me with all your heart (with an honest and humble heart), and I will be found of you, says the Lord."<br>  <br>  Jesus said that the ONLY reason people reject Him is "because their deeds are evil, and they love darkness and hate the light!"  (HEY!  Jesus said that, not me!)<br>  <br>  So, if you refuse to take the challenge Jesus gave, then I don't believe that you really want to know Truth.  It only shows that the ONLY reason why you don't believe in God is because you don't WANT to believe in God.<br>  <br>  Honestly.  Why do you ask questions that you don't want the answer to?  Can we say "hypo-cough-crite"?|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Just silly. They probably do sincerely believe such foolishness.|`|oihouY7Naa	Both.|`|759ae5ae6e1570ab62326b25526ef339aa	Realists. If the theory of evolution were true that small changes are cumulative, all life would blend together. There would be small changes branching from small changes, and there would be no fixed species. In reality, the cumulative small changes do not exist.<br>  There are fossil beds with billions of fossils stretching over millions of years, and the small change transitionals do not exist there either. At the Cambrian explosion, there were thousands of multi-cell life forms that appeared for the first time and they were not linked by small changes to any previous life forms. <br>  Darwinian evolution is not happening now and did not happen in the past, the theory is only imagination and wishful thinking.|`|AA10329469	It's a matter of personal belief and faith.An average person believes in so many things but doesn't have  reasons for all of such beliefs.Creationists may not think about scientists being ignorant but have primarily faith in what they think is right.It's a typical human trait in which we think we are right and nobody is wrong.|`|NLinPsyhaa	YES. It's just as you say, the scientists (most) neglect and reject a creator. They will come up with and entertain ANY idea about our origins as long as it isn't God. It can be an eternal universe ( which is impossible to have an infinite number of past events) multiple universes ( which still doesn't explain where they come from) or aliens ( which doesn't explain where the aliens come from) <br>   Steven Hawking even lied when he came up with a theory that said the universe goes in an egg shaped cycle. But when other scientists investigated it, he had to admit he fudged the numbers to make it work. <br>   and that is being silly.|`|WbaN6osZaa	Both are possible.<br>  <br>  For instance - The banana 'evidence' (Ray Comfort)  was dumber than a box of frogs.

F32uPjAraa	Stonehenge is a calendar.|`|YXGdwwTJaa	People give opinions based on evidence from the past, but also related to the society in which they are living.  <br>  <br>  At one time Stonehenge was mistakenly attributed to the Druids. <br>  <br>   Then, about half a century ago it became a design for astronomical alignments.  This is a partially correct observation as it does seem to have been aligned on the northernmost rising of the Moon and then on the midsummer rising/midwinter setting or the Sun.<br>  <br>  Recently there have been experiments with acoustics which have shown how effective the stones could be with resonance, making sound change according to where the listener was. <br>  <br>  The most recent view is that the blue stones, coming all the way form Presceli in Wales, were used for healing.  Legend states that it is healing to wash in water that comes off the stones.  They are a lovely colour as would the whole monument if it were only to be cleaned! <br>  <br>  My own view is with those who feel that it is mainly a 'cemetery' *** 'garden of remembrance' and place for conducting 'services/rites of passage' in modern terms.  This happened from early times till it was abandoned about three thousand years ago and continued although some aspects of religious observances changed.  This is usual as society tends to alter or create a religion that both reflects its values and will be useful in carrying them on into the futre, carrying the long, heavy and  sometimes imagined, weight of the past with it.  <br>  <br>  AS many cultures revisit where their near relatives are buried as an act of remebrance so many go to Stonehenge to remember and give respect to their very, very, very distant ancestors, whom we imagine were in Britain at the time that Stonehemge flourished.|`|x7qtyglzaa	No place has generated so much speculation and wild theories as the standing stones of Stonehenge. After driving for miles through the rolling hills and plains of the English countryside the sight of this unusual structure makes people gasp. A walk around it only provokes more strange feelings. There's a sense that this is something very important. It taunts us with it's mystery. For over 5000 years it has stood silent vigil over the earth. It has been excavated, x-rayed, measured, and surveyed. Yet despite all that has been learned about its age and construction, its purpose still remains one of the great mysteries of the world.<br>  <br>  Around 3500 BC the semi-nomadic peoples that populated the Salisbury Plain began to build the monument now known as Stonehenge. The original construction was a circular ditch and mound with 56 holes forming a ring around its perimeter. The first stone to be placed at the site was the Heel Stone. It was erected outside of a single entrance to the site. 200 years later 80 blocks of bluestone was transported from a quarry almost 200 miles away in the Prescelly Mountains. It is surmised that these blocks were transported by way of rafts along the Welsh coast and up local rivers, finally to be dragged overland to the site. These stones were erected forming two concentric circles.<br>  <br>  At some point this construction was dismantled and work began on the final phase of the site. The bluestones were moved within the circle and the gigantic stones that give Stonehenge its distinctive look were installed. Some of these massive stones weigh as much as 26 tons! It remains a mystery how such huge stones could have been moved from the quarry at north Wiltshire by a supposedly primitive people.|`|DCltkysDaa	We know much more about how it was designed and built that what it was ‘used’ for. The reason is simple, when dealing with archaeological evidence, especially that relating to prehistoric remains, questions of ‘how’ are easier than questions of ‘why’. Having said that there are many clues in the way it was built and designed which point the way to a broader understanding of Stonehenge.<br>  <br>  Firstly we are beginning to understand that it was mathematically inspired, that it was an accurate geometric ‘mirror image’ symmetrical design. So whatever people believed in, part of their cosmology demanded that the structure consisted of two identical ‘halves’. This fits with the idea that its axis is that of the longest and shortest days of the year (midsummer and midwinter solstices). It was also the midwinter that it was designed to 'face'. We can forget other so called ‘alignments’ of the stones, they don’t exist, the only thing the stones ‘align' upon are themselves, in perfect geometric harmony. It was a work of architecture, designed (‘off site’ so to speak) and largely prefabricated, and the stones set in exact surveyed predetermined positions.<br>  <br>  There is one book that I don't think you will have read, its new ..below<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.solvingstonehenge.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.solvingstonehenge.com</a>|`|AA11367192	Stonehenge, the circular arrangement of large stones near Salisbury, England, was probably built in three stages between about 3000 and 1000 bc.

To be a Muslims does not mean that one is a supporter of terrorism.  Of course for a Muslim to be silent regarding terrorism is to be in effect a proponent of terrorism.  You must be aware that to ask this question in this day and age is to ask people what they think about a group that has declared war upon them.

He is exempt from having any partners, helpers, or fellows. <br>  Muslim is the person accepting and believing the above.<br>  Islam prohibits terrorism in all cases.According to Quran killing one innocent person is like killing all humanity.|`|E0lMycUeaa	ISLAM comes from the root "slm" or "salama". The word ISLAM in reference to the faith is understood in Arabic as the:<br>  <br>  ISLAM means<br>  <br>  Surrender "Give up evil and lusts - give in to the Creator"<br>  <br>  Submission"Agree to the terms and conditions of being a servant of Almighty God"<br>  <br>  Obedience "Comply with His Commandments to the best of your ability"<br>  <br>  Sincerity "Do it all whether or not anyone else notices or cares."<br>  <br>  Peace "Accept what Almighty God gives you in this life in serenity."<br>  <br>  <br>  All of which come about only by giving up the Free Will of the nafs (self or ego) in favor of the Will of the Creator and Sustainer of All That Exists (ALLAH).<br>  <br>  This would be similar to the teaching in the Lord's Prayer for the Christians, when Jesus, peace be upon him, taught his followers a prayer asking for "God's Will to be done on earth as it is in Heaven." (Matt. 6)<br>  <br>  ISLAM is mention in the Quran as a "deen" or way of life of an individual. A complete way of living in balance with everything else in the creation of Almighty Allah. ISLAM provides inclusive instructions for everything including eating, sleeping, dealing in relationships, economics, politics, health, worship and even death. The entire universe is "IN ISLAM" because it is all a part of what has been created and is being sustained by Almighty Allah.<br>  <br>  Now let us consider the next logical question; "What does the term "Muslim" actually mean?"<br>  <br>  Again, we must keep in mind that it is an Arabic word and is of course subject to the rules of the Arabic language. Actually, it is derived from the word ISLAM. Whereas, you might think of ISLAM as the verb or action and MUSLIM as the noun, or the one performing the action. In English whenever we have a noun performing a verb, we add the two suffix letters; ER. But in the Arabic language many times you will find that the prefix letters of MU are used for the same purpose.<br>  <br>  A few examples may help to better understand. We will compare the verb of each language to the one who is reforming the verb:<br>  <br>  Preforming the verbs in ENGLISH/Preforming the verbs in ARABIC<br>  <br>  Travel = TravelER / Safar = MUsafar<br>  Call = CallER / Adhan = MUadhan<br>  Pray = PrayER / Salah = MUsalah<br>  Submit = Submit ER / Islam = MUslim<br>  A "MUSLIM" is one who follows or practices the action of "ISLAM"<br>  <br>  In English, when we understand the "ISLAM" is an action, we might say that anyone who "Islams" is an "Islam-ER." Right? in Arabic the "mu" preceding a verb indicates the same thing. Therefore, we would understand that the one who is actively doing the verb of "Islam" [submission to God] is a "Mu"-Islam or "Muslim."<br>  <br>  Make sense?<br>  <br>  Now, we should ask, "How does a person become a MUSLIM?"<br>  <br>  Only when a person is willing to submit to the Commandments of the Higher Authority from Above, meaning to obey Allah on His terms as much as possible does he/she become a " MUSLIM."<br>  <br>  as for dose all Moslem's terrorist ?sure no<br>  <br>  is there any amazing Moslem's people ?<br>  yes there is a lot (use you tube)<br>  <br>  what most of Moslem's are they good or bad terrorist or kind people?<br>  the majority are good and kind as all mankind but biased media spin<br>  the facts|`|9f2391ebf6a1c505bb9421899963d771aa	Go google it. <br>  <br>  As far as I am concerned, they are going to HELL for worshiping a false idol.|`|jfOSVSQkaa	Maybe you need to go back to school and learn English before posting here.|`|h6vqu7mjaa	I would suggest to you , as a convert muslim myself that you study about Islam.

May you find all the answers you are searching for.|`|L1m5SpYbaa	The religion of Islam is the acceptance of and obedience to the teachings of God which He revealed to His last prophet, Muhammad .<br>  <br>  In the Islamic world, one rarely finds “old people’s homes.” The strain of caring for one’s parents in this most difficult time of their lives is considered an honor and a blessing and an opportunity for great spiritual growth.  In Islam, it is not enough that we only pray for our parents, but we should act with limitless compassion, remembering that when we were helpless children, they preferred us to themselves.  Mothers are particularly honored.  When Muslim parents reach old age, they are treated mercifully, with kindness and selflessness.<br>   <br>  In Islam, serving one’s parents is a duty second to prayer, and it is their right to expect it.  It is considered despicable to express any irritation when, through no fault of their own, the old become difficult.<br>  <br>  Simply, anyone can become a muslim by saying with conviction, “La ilaha illa Allah, Muhammadur rasoolu Allah,” one converts to Islam and becomes a Muslim.  This saying means “There is no true god (deity) but God (Allah),1 and Muhammad is the Messenger (Prophet) of God.”  The first part, “There is no true god but God,” means that none has the right to be worshipped but God alone, and that God has neither partner nor son.  To be a Muslim, one should also:<br>   <br>  * Believe that the Holy Quran is the literal word of God, revealed by Him.<br>  <br>  * Believe that the Day of Judgment (the Day of Resurrection) is true and will come, as God promised in the Quran.<br>  <br>  * Accept Islam as his or her religion.<br>  <br>  * Not worship anything nor anyone except God.|`|kbxCZPROaa	If you are really interested and sincere  about finding an answer to this question, I think you should find a really well versed person in ISLAMIC studies, who will be able to give you the perfect answers to all your question. I will try to answer in short.<br>  1. ISLAM means believing that there is only one god that is ALLAH and prophet Muhammed (pbuh) is his messenger.<br>  2. Being a muslim means following the 5 basics of islam i.e <br>     a. 5 times of  namaaz every day<br>     b. Spreading the word of ALLAH<br>     c. Keeping ROZA or fast during the month of holy Ramzan for 30 days<br>     d. Performing HAJJ pilgrimage at least once in life time<br>     e. Giving ZAKAAT or alms to the poor<br>  3. Perform the above acts dutifully and keep away from alcohol, gambling, Sex outside mairrage etc this is the only things that a muslim has been asked to do.<br>  Insha allah if you seek further knowledge and are sincere about Allah will show you the way|`|v5kPzd0Jaa	EXCUSE ME TROJAN!! but no...we believe you are going hell for lying...even christians go to hell for lying...<br>  you know what <br>  in our religion its not good to brag and its neither not good to say stuff about other religions<br>  and what else??<br>  hmm...<br>  i dont think you shouldve said that<br>  DISCRIMINATION!!

qRx3ynKdaa	No-one knows. Some people think they know. You can find books which claim to give information about the real Arthur. And you can find books which claim there was not real Arthur.<br>  <br>  We have almost no historical information about 5th/6th century Britain. Our one historical source is the writings of Gildas, which you can read in translation here: <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/gildas-full.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/gil...</a> . But this is really mainly a sermon. Gildas doesn’t mention Arthur, though he lived during his time if later traditions are correct. But Gildas doesn't mention many names, so that proves nothing.<br>  <br>  Arthur is mentioned in some early poems. But we do know of some supposedly historical Arthurs in the 6th century, whose exploits may possibly have been incorporated into the emerging story of the legendary Arthur.<br>  <br>  The earliest account to give details is the “Historia Brittonum” which gives some details on 12 battles that Arthur fought against the Saxons. See <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/nennius-full.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/nen...</a> . But at least some of the material in this account is legendary, and the Arthurian material may also be invented. Is the author's source a scrap of genuine history, or inventions of a story-teller? We can’t say.<br>  <br>  The next history of Arthur is found in the “Historia Regum Brittanniae'' of Geoffrey of Monmouth, written about 1136 by Geoffrey of Monmouth, over 700 years after the original Arthur flourished, if he existed. Geoffrey gives details on some of the battles found in the “Historia Regum Brittaniae”, but then goes on to make his Arthur the conqueror of Ireland, the Orkneys, Iceland(!), Norway, Dacia (Denmark) and all of Gaul. His Arthur then defeats a Roman army who is attempting to take back Gaul. See <a href="http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/geofhkb.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/geo...</a> . <br>  <br>  Is this Arthur mostly mythical. It depends in what you mean by “mythical”. But this Arthur, a slayer of giants, is certainly not mainly historical. It is only after Geoffrey’s writing that the tales of Arthur that have come down to us were written, and these are certainly mostly invention. In short, even if there were a real Arthur who was the main foundation of the Arthur legend, by the time almost all the tales were written that have come down to us, the details of this real Arthur have been almost entirely lost.<br>  <br>  Compare the medieval tales of Dietrich of Berne. The character of Dietrich was based on Theodoric the Goth, but there is very little of the historical Theodoric left in the tales. See <a href="http://pw1.netcom.com/~kyamazak/myth/dietrich/sandbach.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pw1.netcom.com/~kyamazak/myth/die...</a> .<br>  <br>  Just as with Dietrich, the surviving material about King Arthur is “legendary” or “mythical”, whether or not Arthur himself was real.<br>  <br>  The earliest sources also never call Arthur a king. He is a “miles” (meaing "soldier, knight") or a “tyrannus” or a “dux bellorum” (meaning “leader of war”). In Welsh stories Arthur is always called “amheraudyr” from Latin “imperator' (“emperor”), perhaps with the original meaning of the word which was “commander-in-chief”.
qRx3ynKdaa	The “King Arthur” legend, as it comes down to us, really starts with Geoffrey of Monmouth's “Historia Regum Brittaniae” in which Arthur is a great conqueror and giant-killer who won the throne of Gaul in a single combat and defeated the Saxons and the Romans.See <a href="http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/geofhkb.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/geo...</a> . But while Arthur is battling the Romans, his regent Mordred rebels. Arthur and Mordred fight in a battle in which almost everyone on both sides is killed, and Arthur, mortally wounded, is taken off to the faery island of Avalon to be healed.<br>  <br>  But there are a few mentions of Arthur in earlier saint lives. See <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/1150-Caradoc-LifeofGildas.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/115...</a> . For one Welsh tale that is possibly earlier than Geoffrey, see <a href="http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celtic/ctexts/culhwch.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celt...</a> .<br>  <br>  Presumably there were many tales told which have not survived.<br>  <br>  Arthurian romances come along later written in verse. Each romance normally focuses on the adventures of a single knight, or sometimes two knights, at Arthur’s court. These are to some extent written to a formula: the knight wins the hand of a rich and beautiful lady, battles Gawain to a standstill, and defeats giants, robber knights, and so forth. It is doubtful that there is any history in any of these.<br>  <br>  Also the earlier romances normally don’t contain any mention of Arthur’s conquests and don’t usually contain references to his end. Mordred normally doesn’t even appear. The authors seem to imagine Arthur as a magnificent king of Britain who reigned long ago, but it might appear that they otherwise know nothing about him.<br>  <br>  However the later prose romances  combine material from Geoffrey with romance writing. See <a href="http://www.timelessmyths.com/arthurian/vulgate.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.timelessmyths.com/arthurian/v...</a> for a summary of the Arthurian Vulgate Cycle. This is vaguely based on Geoffrey’s account. That is, Arthur fights Saxons in he beginning of his reign. Arthur wins the kingship of Gaul in a dual while attempting to aid Lancelot (not mentioned in Geoffrey) to regain his heritage. Arthur fights the Romans in a short account, but he is actually in Gaul to fight against Lancelot. As in Geoffrey, Mordred rebels when Lancelot is in Gaul and the last battle is told.<br>  <br>  Three of the romances in the “Vulgate Cycle” were more-or-less accepted as true in later prose romances: the “Prose Lancelot", “The Quest of the Holy Grail”, and the “Death of Arthur”, though some of the events in these romances are retold in variant formats in the later romances.<br>  <br>  Another form of the Arthurian legend appears in Sir Thomas Malory’s “Le Morte d’Arthur”. This is mostly based on the French prose romances. But the Roman war is moved to a position early in Arthur's reign. (This had already been done in a French romance commonly called the “Vulgate Merlin”.) Arthur’s conquest of Gaul is not told. Gareth, Gawain’s brother, is given more importance.<br>  <br>  Some changes occur during the development of the legend. In the early tales that have come down to us, Gawain, Arthur's nephew, is generally the best knight in court, only equaled or arguably surpassed by the hero of each individual romance. Naturally, in the “Prose Lancleot”, Lancelot is superior to Gawain. And also Lancelot’s half-brother Hector and his cousin Bohort (Bors) and Lancelot's son Galahad (and probably Perceval). In the later romances many more knights are pictured as superior to Gawain, who increasingly is pictured as an immoral murderer of good knights and a rapist, whose reputation is largely fraudulent.<br>  <br>  Better knights include Palamedes, Blioberis, Brunor the Black (known as La Cote Mal Tailliée), Lamorat, Tristan, Erec son of Lac.<br>  <br>  Perceval is the hero of the grail quest in early tales. Later tales add Galahad who becomes the main grail hero, and also adds Bohort (Bors), Lancelot's cousin.<br>  <br>  In the earlier tales Mordred is Arthur’s nephew. Beginning with the “Prose Lancelot” Mordred is usually both Arthur's nephew and his illegimate son, begotten on his half-sister.|`|YXGdwwTJaa	the same as it ever was.<br>  <br>  Choose between the medieval style chivalrous king, with knights of the found table at his court, and a love triangle between Arthur's wife Guinevere and Lancelot, who does not appear in tales until early medieval times.  There are lots of romantic stories about these, including the legend of seeking the grail and the castle of the maimed fisher king.     Or go back to the times just after the Romans had withdrawn officially form Britain and the people had to look after themselves.  Here Arthur would have been a leader of a mobile army, travelling around to fight off what we see as invasions, largely by Anglo Saxons, though now some of this is disputed.   He appears in old stories about a relative marrying a giant's daughter and chasing a destructive sow and a boar across the lands, or going  on a journey of rescuing a young man from the underworld from which only seven returned.  Arthur is reputed not to have died after the battle, against his illegitimate son ( a neat insertion), but to have been taken by his half sister and her ladies of Avalon to the sacred isle for healing, form which he will return to save his country, though he may also be the warrior who lies sleeping under a hill surrounded by his also dormant knight.   <br>  <br>  There are lots of interesting fictional books which tell these stories.|`|x7qtyglzaa	King Arthur is a legendary British leader who, according to medieval histories and romances, led the defence of Britain against the Saxon invaders in the early 6th century. The details of Arthur's story are mainly composed of folklore and literary invention, and his historical existence is debated and disputed by modern historians.[2] The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources, including the Annales Cambriae, the Historia Brittonum, and the writings of Gildas. Arthur's name also occurs in early poetic sources such as Y Gododdin.[3]<br>  <br>  The legendary Arthur developed as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain).[4] However, some Welsh and Breton tales and poems relating the story of Arthur date from earlier than this work; in these works, Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore, sometimes associated with the Welsh Otherworld, Annwn.[5] How much of Geoffrey's Historia (completed in 1138) was adapted from such earlier sources, rather than invented by Geoffrey himself, is unknown.<br>  <br>  Although the themes, events and characters of the Arthurian legend varied widely from text to text, and there is no one canonical version, Geoffrey's version of events often served as the starting point for later stories. Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established an empire over Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Norway and Gaul. In fact, many elements and incidents that are now an integral part of the Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey's Historia, including Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, the wizard Merlin, the sword Excalibur, Arthur's birth at Tintagel, his final battle against Mordred at Camlann and final rest in Avalon. The 12th-century French writer Chrétien de Troyes, who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story, began the genre of Arthurian romance that became a significant strand of medieval literature. In these French stories, the narrative focus often shifts from King Arthur himself to other characters, such as various Knights of the Round Table. Arthurian literature thrived during the Middle Ages but waned in the centuries that followed until it experienced a major resurgence in the 19th century. In the 21st century, the legend lives on, both in literature and in adaptations for theatre, film, television, comics and other media.|`|PWzJEIqPaa	It depends on what version you are after? there is the original, the one exported to the French and the one brought back the French invasion of England.

We were indeed going through some rough patches in our relationship for the past year or two with various personal arguments that really had nothing to do with us, just inner anger [mostly on my part]. & she didn't want that to happen [me cheating on her]... That she thought the relationship was probably going to end or get worse the way we were fighting... & that she felt kind of routine, not totally, bored in a sense because of the actual tension between us. Kind of like you readers picturing having sex often with someone you fight with [you need to have sex but both of you or one of you is causing problems in the relationship yet you still have sex with that person]. But that yes in her mind she's thought about a fantasy like that just for the fact that she would also like to know what it feels like to be touched in two places at once. Such as her taking me orally and a female down on her. Or a female kissing her down there, and me having intercourse behind the female. She's said that it's just been a fantasy she's had here and there on some occasions. & that one of the other reasons she asked me was just to see what I had to say about it. As in if I would just be like "OK" sure I don't care, or if I would care. I asked her to think about a fantasy like that becoming a reality and how she would feel if it came true. I was vivid with her and illustrated the event... I said "ok so say it starts and she kisses you, than she kisses me, you take me orally and so does she, than she plays with you and i do to, and than i have intercourse with you, and than have intercourse with her, letting her ride me or whatever." When I finished saying all of that she started CRYING... She said "come to think of it I could never see a girl ride you or anything like that it would hurt me". That kind of confuses me more... So I told her "hey than if it's just a fantasy in your head than I guess you can continue to have that. Now that you feel this way about it coming true it might go away." I also asked her if she's ever fantasized about being with another girl alone and she said "I can't lie I have had that fantasy a few times over our five years together but rarely." I asked her what she thought about girls and she said "well it's just their bodies are beautiful. I could never be in a relationship with a girl. I'm too into men and too much of a women for that. I guess it's just that they're attractive and sensual beings. Like the episode of seinfeld where they showed jerry and a woman naked and how women look beautiful naked and men just look like they're just THERE." I asked her if she considered doing something sexual behind my back with a women was cheating to her and she said "NO." I explained to her that to me it is as if she were with a man and I do find it as cheating. She said that because I see it that way she sees it like that too and respects that. Eventually she said "ya I can see what you mean... me getting off on a girl instead of you... ya i see what you mean it's the whole using thing and getting off on it." I asked her if she thinks about the instance with her and the girl back in her younger days and she said "no... it was just something that happened... I kissed girls on the mouth before too during around the same times and that was just a thing girls were doing... not like making out or whatever just whole mouth kisses." I asked her how many girls shes done that with in her past and she said 20 to 30. So well she said she never really talked to that girl she had a sexual experience with again really after that and went their ways and they just brushed it off when they'd see each other as something that happened. I'm now wondering if she was or still is just bi-curious... I heard/read that bi-curiosity could simply be a phase, and that most women are or at one point become attracted to females and sometimes it becomes sexual realities or fantasy's. So in conclusion what do you all think of what she's said to me know that I took all of your advice to talk to her? We've never talked about our sexuality or fantasy's like this in the 5 years we've been together. She even asked me what mine were and I told her things like sexual intercourse on a balcony at a hotel, she said another of hers is with me in a change room at a clothing store, and we both agreed that we would like to touch each other in a dark theater. I could tell that she really liked to hear these dirty things and feels closer to me now than ever before. We slept together real nice last night in each others arms. & I can't lie we did have sex after that and have been having lots of it recently. Oh yah we've driven past strip clubs before and shes made mentions of like "would you like me to go in there with you one day?" She doesn't know I have gone to some. She thinks I never have been. So I asked her if she would go to a strip club with me one day and she said "umm sure I guess I dunno I only asked you that as a joke. I can't really imagine you getting off on other girls dancing that would feel bad." I asked her well what about you how would you like that and she said "I dunno I don't think it would really do much for me, but if you want to than I'd rather go with you". I suggested buying her a vibrator or toy and she said she doesn't need one because she has me or can use her hands in private. She said shes never had one either... I also suggested porn and she said watching it is "hot". That she hasn't watched it since shes been with me but on occasions before us she has. That it would probably be cool to watch it together... She actually asked me if buying an erotic story book would be ok... I said "I dunno"... She said of course I'd picture you as the leading man. So in the end I'd like to know what you all think of my girlfriends character as a person, sexual preference, and tips on what we should do to spice things up, or whatever you want to say.
qky7gWosaa	It depends how juvenile he is. If there is only one year difference between us, I would consider marrying him. But I prefer men to be at least three or four years older than me.<br>  <br>  =)|`|ozpB4ADVaa	I would marry a man younger than me.<br>  <br>  Reason : Because it does not matter after a certain age. The maturity is hopefully there, and experience does not always match age. I have seen 50 + year old men who are mentally at the age of 17. Then I have seen some 25 + year men  who are at the maturity of a 40 or 50 year old.<br>  Age is truly a number that humans look at for different types of gaging. It is the person and the upbringing that matters. <br>  <br>  I also starred your question - good luck with whatever research you are doing.|`|Fv43CHVSaa	No, I would not.<br>  <br>  I've known one younger guy, & he was immature like he got mad over silly things & he was annoying at times... acting  just like my annyoying brother.. & if you marry a younger guy, maybe later at life, he'll regret it cuz he wasn't mature enough when he made the decision...... <br>  <br>  I prefer older guys (4-8 yrs) cuz they bear your moody behaviors, they know more about life, & you can rely on them...|`|nDSLNnguaa	My husband is 3.9 years younger than me.  It's awesome!  He keeps me young.  The only downside was I hit 30 before him and had to wait 3.9 years for him to join me.<br>  <br>  Edit: sorry I didn't see the Why?  <br>  Because that's who I fell in love with and age wasn't really an issue to me.  Plus like I said I'm immature and always looked VERY young for my age. Most guys my own age thought I was too young for them before they found out how old I really was.  <br>  Plus now that I'm in my 30's and have reached my sexual peak he can keep up.  (I guess I probably shouldn't say that here. Sorry)|`|6nWGMP5Laa	well brother i guess age does not have any direct impact but psychologically it has.<br>  i guess this is something natural that women r dependent on men<br>  a wife is dependent to her husband so thats y i guess boys think to marry a girl younger and a girl like to marry a boy older than her age.<br>  maybe i am wrong but its wat i think|`|4MqkgMzDaa	I dont know really. Women mature faster than men and so for men to have an older wife may not be bad (It might be bad for the woman though...). But if my husband (I don't have one yet) was younger, I wouldnt want him to be TOO young. Maybe by a couple of years, thatd be okay. But Im pretty sure I'd prefer an older husband. Mature, strong, and protective which is what a husband should be, right?|`|ILc1XIPraa	I would marry whoever I see the best character in.

While it is true that men mature at a later age than women, a relationship between a younger man and an older woman can still work. Sometimes the man, even though younger, can be gifted with an advanced maturity level despite his age. In some cases, it might be good for a woman to marry a younger guy because she naturally has a dominant personality. (When you have an older husband, it is sometimes harder to be on equal decision-making footing with your husband, much less a higher footing) I say, the most important thing is to marry close to your age range though. I'm not saying that marriages between those with a considerable age gap cannot work, however, it just makes sense for the two people to be at the same stages of life, going through similar experiences, etc in order to best understand and sympathize with each other.|`|xP8blznMaa	Salam<br>  <br>  well im a girl and i never thought about it<br>  <br>  but thinking about it now no reason 1 i wanna a man who's older and can teach me right from wrong and sooooo on <br>  <br>  but age doesn't really matter u no as long as u love one another <br>  .... wait im not saying if ur a women who's 25 and wanting to get married to a 19 year old or younger thats grossssssss!!!<br>  <br>  but Allah nows who for who and whats coming up in ur life|`|nnj6A8luaa	I don't care about her age as long as I love her. <br>  <br>  The girl I'm in love with is more than 3 years younger than I am but I've never let that get between us because she means the world to me and I love her too much to let something as trivial as a small age difference drift us apart.

I don't want to feel like I'm his mother! lol<br>  <br>  3rd reason: I like my man to be older because I will feel that he is more responsible and that he is actually the man of the family. <br>  <br>  <br>  Salam!|`|3E2EQH12aa	my husband is 2 months younger than me<br>  <br>  i dont advise girls on marrying a younger guy, because men are NEVER as mature as women at the same ages. believe me ive seen it , and lived it.youre going to need someone at least 4-5 years older than you are.|`|mxIYhkAnaa	depends if he could fullfill his duties upon me...

The panic was precipitated when two financial speculators, James Fisk and Jay Gould, attempted to corner the U.S. gold market. On September 20 they began purchasing gold in New York City; by September 24 they controlled enough of the available supply in the city to bid up the price from about 140 to 163y. This rapid increase in the price of gold threw the stock exchange into confusion, and the prices of commodities fluctuated wildly. The inflationary run on gold was halted toward the close of the business day when U.S. Secretary of the Treasury George Sewall Boutwell announced that the federal government had made $4 million of its gold reserves available for trading. Fisk and Gould probably made a profit of about $11 million by their manipulations, but many businesspeople claimed to have been ruined by the panic.<br>  <br>  The name Black Friday has occasionally been applied also to the Friday of September 19, 1873, when the New York Stock Exchange suffered a major financial crash that ushered in the panic of 1873.|`|9MXG3O74aa	It's when you can find bargains on stuff at stores <a href="http://www.blackfriday.info/" rel="nofollow">http://www.blackfriday.info/</a> .

Could be a lot worse.|`|2xPWnuhVaa	...how old is ur girlfriend?|`|PGCKZl1Laa	How old is she? And may I ask what exactly it is you see in her? no offense but if you are asking this you obviously have some second thoughts. Yeah she really might have some issues! rethink what you got yourself into. maybe take her for a ride (preferably in her footies) to the "ice cream shop" (wink wink) and really make it a trip to the "nice doctor" with the couch in his office. oh and take her sipie cup with. LOL enjoy youself with it too!|`|ZN2dmoEnaa	Maybe she was neglected as a child and wants someone to give her childish type attention. Go ahead and make your g/f happy, that's why she keeps you around, right?<br>  If you don't make her happy, someone else will.

VYMOwgc3aa	What is your boyfriend into? My boyfriend loves electric guitars so I just got him one for V-Day along with a bunch of guitar accessories.    What you get him depends on what he likes & how much you have or are willing to spend.    If he likes music then get him a few CDs or a hoodie or T-shirt with his fav band/artist on it.    A nice wallet.    A nice watch.    A gift card to his fav store.    If you're good at cooking then make him a nice lunch or dinner.    Buy/Make him a little ice cream cake in his fav flavors.    Whatever you get him though, be sure to attach a nice little card with a special message you've written just for him :)    Good Luck |`|K86A0hyEaa	can't go wrong with gig tickets.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	Buy some fake rose petals (or real ones) and place them on your bed, make his initials stand out.

They only accept in their "club" people in the top 2% IQ.|`|Nu6vDwLtaa	oh, i though u were talking about the organisation that allows people with high iq to join.  it is taken from the latin word for table.    but, since the question was about a spanish word then it means stupid or dumb.|`|RAnBl0JFaa	it means dumb, stupid, someone not smart      Eres una mensa,  You are stupid|`|c34c2236afd420be57992daf512144dbaa	Means Dumb in spanish.

H41u0B8Jaa	You need to be approachable and fair and also handle issues with tact and diplomacy.  You also need to be able to motivate your staff and make everyone feel they are part of the team.|`|dST3XrkNaa	You should be good at communication - with clients, colleagues, juniors and seniors. Tactical but not shrewd, else in long term it won't help.Systematic in work and down to earth so that any one approach you.     You need to be clear about your own target and steps to achieve them with the help of your team and that you should be able to motivate them.|`|Ao3Fl3iSaa	As a manager, you are a leader.  Here's a good book to start off on:  http://www.amazon.com/LEADERSHIP-TRAININ...|`|DF22BQ3yaa	To deal with people.|`|REC4YgOuaa	You need to be to have excellent customer service skills, you need to be able to handle tough situations, ability to think on your feet, show up to work on time, and be able to manage your staff|`|QIQNzE11aa	Many managers don't make good managers. So you don't always need to have good qualities to become one apparently.     But, to be worth management material most want to see a few things. Like being able to lead others. Leadership is very important. Being able to face large problems and being a problem solver is another important task of a manager. Being able to follow through and have the resolve to dealing with bully's or bad employee's. Being able to fire as easily has hire when necessary.    Many companies believe that someone who is likable is not management material. They like a hard core type person who won't make friends so will have no difficulties in firing anyone at any time. Other companies want their managers to be very likable so that employee's will work harder for them. Both have it's down and ups in the field. I prefer someone inbetween.     Friendships with employees aren't really liked, which is why many are often passed over for management. The ones who are left behind are resentful and often times undermind the authority of their old friend. or the friend who makes management lets too much slide from their old friend. Which is why so many employee's are often passed over.     I like someone who puts their all into work. Someone dedicated and hard working. Not someone who slacks off and only does as they are asked. Someone who takes initiative, who knows that the more prosperous my business is the more they could eventually earn in a bonus that year. Someone who not only works for me, but works with me. Someone who makes suggestions that are helpful and beneficial. Someone who wants to be a success and grow with the company. Someone who is strong minded enough to have no fear of making suggestions, someone who also knows and accepts that any or all their suggestions might be ignored and do not demand explanations for the tossing of them. Someone who doesn't need me help every day to do their job. Otherwise i wouldn't need a manager. Decisive, quick minded, intelligent, good grammar, knows to dress the part, hard working, leader and well mannered. A manager reflects my company at all times. If they are swearing, some will chose not to use my company. If they are out there talking poorly about others, some might not use me. If they are wearing the shabbiest of clothing, with body parts hanging out, my company will look as if it's not worth very much. I don't hire someone on their physical looks, but how they present themselves. I don't expect people to dress in expensive clothing, just not falling apart or revealing dress. No one will take a person seriously if their behind or top is constantly sticking out of their clothing.|`|ucsYXXdSaa	you need to be able to get people to feel good about doing what they need to do.  not easy, thats why most people are useless managers

yAJg37PGaa	lol This is a funny question. Your in luck, though. I'm an English Major.    Usually teachers don't look too closely at things such as these; if you claim that one outrageous thing about you is that you like to fish at two in the morning naked, they may doubt you, but think of three unique things about you. You can think of something.    Like to draw? Write? Eye Color? Missing a tooth? Nutty best friend? Small Room? Big Room? Pyromaniac? Crazy about a TV show? Love to text? Have a crush on someone? Tempted to tackle someone? Well there you go (and I don't suggest taking that last one.)    If I were doing that paper:  1.) I listen to rock AND classical music... crazy, huh?  2.) I like to drink pickle juice.  3.) I don't like to drive, really.    You can do it ; )|`|3E2EQH12aa	well that hair color is totally outrageous i mean come on|`|GPBRLG2saa	only one paragraph...lucky u do silly things like you can whistle through your nose or something...|`|GM0kOZpRaa	ill agree with the other 2 people|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	Relax I can tell you're very stressed out right now.  What it means is, your teacher wants to know three things about you that others may find outrageous.  For example, have you ever done something crazy, or dangerous on a dare?  We don't know you or what you've done, so WE can't answer it, only you can.  If you have never done anything outrageous, then just write about some of your personality traits that others may find outrageous or a little weird.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	I agreed w/Blue Eyed + Mustapha    ...and those nails!

1luSC9rVaa	Every educated person will tell you, Weed is not addictive... BUT it is very habit forming and can burden your cash flow... I am a casual smoker, I take a few hits every 2 or 3 days when i'm relaxing with my friends. some of my friends however arent casual at all... they constantly complain about not having money and not having jobs, but still go out and spend $30 on weed every day.    Not everyone is like this however... Marijuana is what you make it. If you want to smoke to enhance an activity you do in moderation, do it! some people expect it to enhance their LIVES and it doesn't work that way... you'll get lazy as hell. It is what you make it! (this doesn't apply to everyone, some people can smoke all the time and don't let it take too much of a toll on motivation).    Alcoholism is something that either has to develop over a very long period of time OR you have the disease from birth (my case). I'm only 19 and I can't go 2 days without a drink or else my hands start to shake and my mouth waters craving my next drink.    Both are negative to a person when not used in moderation and wisely. Overall I believe alcoholism is near impossible to stop while long term daily marijuana use is not nearly as hard to cease.    Marijuana was made illegal in 1937. Dupont, a company seeking to make huge profits off the synthesis of oil and coal to create plastics, knew the industrialization of hemp would take away up to 80% of his business.    Through the means of propaganda, yellow journalism, racism, and pure lies... Dupont turned what was America's 3rd grossing cash crop into nothing more than "Weed". Our founding fathers grew hemp... and smoked it... and now it is illegal?!    America has become the great land of contradictions.|`|AA10106002	One's legal, one's not. Both are harmful if abused.|`|a1pmr73vaa	Mjane should be legal period and easier to get even if is not.

If you vaporize cannabis there are no negative effect. Alcohol has moderate addiction level and can lead to bad health problem with long term use. Also, alcohol is related in many car accident and domestic violence. When someone drive on cannabis they normally act more careful because they are aware of their impairment, if someone drive drunk they are less aware of their impairment. Cannabis makes people non aggressive, it is illegal because it is bad for the consumer capitalist system we live in.|`|Onzxe6ysaa	What is worse?    Worst case senario -     Alchohol - get drunk, drive, kill some people, don't die yourself, go to jail, have liver damage, and just be a sucky, rude, mean person.    Weed - Smoke, forget to take out the garbage....|`|a62b895e23928e2555a83a605626c900aa	I think that Alcohol is the worse legal drug there is . The Government should have left it illegal .But it makes them an enormous amount of money at the addicts and the families expense .    I did notice a couple of things in your question, now don't get mad at me :o) ,but you defend marijuana .  Just like an alcoholic defends alcohol. They don't see their problem either .  My nephew was addicted to Marijuana, he will tell you so.    Edit : I'm sorry BDiz, I misunderstood.

MhfneF0xaa	I also like what St. Paul wrote, "If we say we have no sin, we decieve ourselves, and the truth is not in us." 1 John 1:8,    and    "Or how can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take out the speck that is in your eye,' when you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye.

(it sometimes is but that's just sick people who have no consideration for people who do have a self harming problem these people are normally very insecure).
vM9CxOKKaa	I think they can be really beautiful people. Just they can be a bit hard to get to know really well. A lot of hard work is involved in forming a relationship with them but if successful, they are the best type of friends. In most cases they don't have many friends but if you can make one as a friend, they will stick by you loyally and trust is very strong. There is also a few problems though, if you break the trust bond they will easily resent you for it and will more than likely end the relationship. As far as family goes, I imagine whoever you refer to is restricted by a family bond. Once again loyally not seeking to venture outside what they know and trust. Of course that does not mean its impossible to get to know them, they are just cautious and because of this they come across a little strange.  Its funny how opposites attract. It can be found that a lot of shy people end up attached with outgoing people.

I screamed and wet the bed.(i was 7!)He disappeared. I have woke up countless times since then to see him sitting on my bed. My Dad has walked by my room and seen him on my bed.

It only took the doctor about 2 seconds to say, "Gimme a break, lady! Your daughter is pregnant!"    The mother turn red with fury, and she argued with the doctor that *her* daughter was a good girl, and would *never* compromise her reputation by having sex with a boy.    The doctor faced the window and silently watched the horizon.    The mother became enraged and screamed, "Quit looking out the window! Aren't you paying attention to me?"    "Yes, of course I am paying attention, ma'am. It's just that the last time this happened, a star appeared in the east, and three wise men came. I was hoping they'd show up again, and help me figure out who got your daughter pregnant!"   --------------------------------------...    A man wonders if having sex on the Sabbath is a sin because he is not sure if sex is work or play. He asks a priest for his opinion on this question. The priest says after consulting the Bible, "My son, after an exhaustive search I am positive sex is work and is not permitted the Sabbath."    The man thinks: "What does a priest know about sex?"    He goes to minister... a married man, experienced for the answer. He queries the minister and receives the same reply. Sex is work and not for the Sabbath! Not pleased with the reply, he seeks out the ultimate authority -- a man of thousands of year's tradition and knowledge: a rabbi.    The rabbi ponders the question and states, "My son, sex is definitely play."    The man replies, "rabbi, how can you be so sure when so many others tell me sex is work?"    The rabbi softly speaks, " If sex were work...my wife would have the maid do it."|`|FIXKYCIGaa	Yes, but I stay away from those.

"I raised him as a good Jew, but now he comes to me and tells me that he has become a Christian."    There is silence from the Lord for a moment.    "The same thing happened to me."|`|2FsNdcXEaa	It's been a busy day at St. Peter's Gates, and only people who have died a truly horrible death are being allowed in. There are 3 men next in line. St. Peter asks the first man, "How did you die?"  The first man replies, "You see, I suspected my wife was cheating on me, so I snuck home to try and catch her. I got home early and searched the entire house, and couldn't find a man anywhere. Then low and behold, there is a man hanging over the balcony of our apartment building! So I went over and started beating on his hands, and he fell. Amazingly, he got up from the 10 story fall, so I pushed our refridgerator onto him and he died instantly. I was so worked up by that point that I had a heart attack right on the spot and died."  "That's pretty bad," said St. Peter. He looks at the next guy and says, "And your story?"  "Well," said the second man, "I was doing my afternoon exercises on the balcony of my apartment, and I must have slipped on something because I flipped over the balcony. Fortunately, I caught on to the balcony below my story. Then a man came out and I thought I was saved, and he started beating on my hands! I fell 10 stories and miraculously survived. Then I looked up and a refridgerator fell right on me! I died right then and there."  "That's awful! What is your story?" St. Peter asks, motioning to the third man.  "Well you see," said the last man, "I'm hiding in this married man's refridgerator..."|`|XTyAMS5yaa	The inventor of the Harley-Davidson motorcycle, Arthur Davidson , died and went to heaven.    At the gates, St. Peter told Arthur. 'Since you've been such a good man and your motorcycles have changed the world, your reward is, you can hang out with anyone you want to in heaven.'    Arthur thought about it for a minute and then said, ' I want to hang out with God.'  St. Peter took Arthur to the Throne Room, and introduced him to God.    God recognized Arthur and commented, 'Okay, so you were the one who invented the Harley-Davidson   motorcycle? '   Arthur said, 'Yeah, that's me...'    God commented: 'Well, what's the big deal in inventing something that's pretty unstable, makes noise   and pollution and can't run without a road?'    Arthur was a bit embarrassed, but finally spoke, 'Excuse me, but aren't you the inventor of woman?'   God said, 'Ah, yes.'    'Well,' said Arthur, 'professional to professional, you have some major design flaws in your invention !   1. There's too much inconsistency in the front-end suspension   2. It chatters constantly at high speeds  3. Most rear ends are too soft and wobble about too much  4. The intake is placed way too close to the exhaust   5. The maintenance costs are outrageous!!!!    'Hmmmmm, you may have some good points there,' replied God, 'hold on.'    God went to his Celestial supercomputer, typed in a few words and waited for the results.    The computer printed out a slip of paper and God read it.    'Well, it may be true that my invention is flawed,' God said to Arthur, 'but according to these numbers, more men are riding my invention than yours !|`|UmZznLuhaa	God will Provide    A young woman brings home her fiance to meet her parents. After dinner, her mother tells her father to find out about the young man.    The father invites the fiancee to his study for a drink. "So what are your plans?"  the father asks the young man.    "I am a Torah scholar." he replies.    "A Torah scholar. Hmmm," the father says. "admirable, but what will you do to provide a nice house for my daughter to live in, as she's accustomed to?"    "I will study," the young man replies, "and God will provide for us."    "And how will you buy her a beautiful engagement ring, such as she deserves?"  asks the father.    "I will concentrate on my studies," the young man replies, "God will provide  for us."    "And children?" asks the father. "How will you support children?"    "Don't worry, sir, God will provide," replies the fiance. The conversation  proceeds like this, and each time the father questions, the young idealist  insists that God will provide.    Later, the mother asks, "How did it go, Honey?"    The father answers, "He has no job and no plans, but the good news is he  thinks I'm God!"      -------------------------------------  There's a Time and Place for Skepticism         During the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution, one morning's executions began with three men: a rabbi, a Catholicpriest, and a rationalist skeptic.          The rabbi was marched up onto the platform first. There, facing the guillotine, he was asked if he had any last words. And the rabbi cried out, "I believe in the one and only true God, and He shall save me." The executioner then positioned the rabbi below the blade, set the block above his neck, and pulled the cord to set the terrible instrument in motion. The heavy cleaver plunged downward, searing the air. But then, abruptly, it stopped with a crack just a few inches above the would-be victim's neck. To which the rabbi said, "I told you so."     "It's a miracle!" gasped the crowd. And the executioner had to agree, letting the rabbi go.     Next in line was the priest. Asked for his final words, he declared, "I believe in Jesus Christ  the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost  who will rescue me in my hour of need." The executioner then positioned this man beneath the blade. And he pulled the cord. Again the blade flew downward  thump! creak!  ...stopping just short of its mark once more.     "Another miracle!" sighed the disappointed crowd. And the executioner for the second time had no choice but to let the condemned go free.     Now it was the skeptic's turn. "What final words have you to say?" he was asked. But the skeptic didn't hear. Staring intently at the ominous engine of death, he seemed lost. Not until the executioner poked him in the ribs and the question was asked again did he reply.     "Oh, I see your problem," the skeptic said pointing. "You've got a blockage in the gear assembly, right there!"|`|lVSDB0Hwaa	Whats the difference between Jesus and a picture of Jesus?    you only need 1 nail to hang up the picture.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Besides the one I'm looking at?

Your religion is that so long as you pursue God and become a better person, you're saved, which excludes those many who die without ever having improved themselves morally.    When there are two belief systems that hold views that obviously contradict the views of the other religion, only one can be right.  There must be a universal truth.

Many many people change their religious views as they get older.    Next, referring to Christianity alone...  The bible clearly shows that all roads do not lead to God  Look at Jesus words at Matthew 7:21-23  Here Jesus is saying that there will be some who claim to be Christian (even doing powerful works) but notice he rejects them.  Earlier on in the chapter Jesus shows that few are the ones finding the narrow road.... & that the wide spacious road (which most are on) will lead off into destruction (verses 13 & 14)    Now it may seem prudent to you to adopt all beliefs (including evolution) & attempt to put them all together in one big pot & give it a stir & then believe everything that you've mixed together....... but you'll still have conflicts of belief within that mixture that can't possibly add up to truth  .. and it won't save you at Armageddon when you find you're not on the narrow road - Matthew 7:13, 14|`|eCp0ERSCaa	Actually, it can be stated much more simply: All religions are wrong.|`|PXVDJaYdaa	1 is right, some are almost right, some are wrong|`|Ny7PHJiAaa	Each religion is different with there own ways of thinking...so its hard to say.|`|kNCCrjOeaa	i beleive that if someone beleives it that it is true no matter what the religion is.|`|XTyAMS5yaa	Yes I do agree with you that all religions are right, or all are wrong.

Preposterous.      Thats saying that All religions are different paths to the same place.       1.  If all religions are different paths to the same place, then why do the paths contradict each other? Does truth contradict itself? Let's review the teachings of just three religions:     2. Buddhism is pantheistic and says there is no personal God and everyone can reach "godlikeness" on his own. Islam says that Jesus was just a prophet, and not the only way to God. Christianity says that there is a personal God, and that the only way to Him is through Jesus (John 14:6). If these three religions are, as you say, different paths to the same place, then why do they contradict each other? Does truth contradict itself?|`|edOU65xAaa	All religions contain both right and wrong elements.

While they might have similar aspects in some regards they are all far to different in the particulars and the deeper meanings of these teachings. Christianity explains this by saying both that man is made in the image of God and so man is unique and special by being personable like God and the man has the law of God written on his heart. These two concepts taken together show that Christianity explains how the various religions might have similar aspects, it all comes from the same source just the majority is corrupted and is in willful rebellion against God.|`|U51pBeLfaa	I agree with all the religions are "correct'.

I was condemning the behavior of evangelicals such as losasha, who operate only under a "Me and Jesus" attitude; meanwhile praising the Christ-like religious tolerance displayed by my fellow Catholics, such as Dogma. Dogma, I know that you are Catholic Christian, not a fundie.     I was up kinda late while typing this answer, so I must not have been thinking properly about my wording. When I said "first two answers: Losasha and Dogma", I meant that I was comparing Losasha to Dogma, pointing out the differences.    I'm deeply sorry for the misunderstanding. I was condemning Losasha's answer, while praising Dogma's answer.    I've edited my original response. See below:  ______________________    mmk... this is a really good example of the bull-headedness of evangelicalism vs. the Christ-like religious tolerance displayed by Catholicism.    The first answer: Losasha    This answer shows me that not only are fundies bull-headed and ignorant, but they also have clearly not been taught an ounce of philosophy. Their religion puts blinders on them so thick that it practically impairs their way of life!    Fundamentalists, I will pray for you!    Second answer - Dogma    Your answer clearly displays far more religious tolerance and overall, unbiased philosophical knowledge. I'm glad that fellow Catholics such as yourself do not operate on the "Me and Jesus" attitude.|`|Lk4aCBACaa	False. I see it more like this: all religions are right for the person following them, no more and no less. I don't think there's any such thing as "one true" religion or "one true" deity. What's "right" for one person may not be right for another.    That and for the vast majority of religions to be "right," a vast number of others must be "wrong" according to the beliefs spelled out by those who are considered "right." For example, for Christianity to be "right", I'd have to accept the idea that I as a polytheist am "really" worshiping their Devil at worst, or worshiping their god by "different names" at best. I do not accept either of those ideas, therefore I cannot see their religion as "right" because it is in direct contradiction to my own. But I can see mine as right for me and theirs as right for them: my religion doesn't teach that it's the only correct one.    For the rest of your question, the idea of salvation is irrelevant to me, because I don't believe there's anything I need saving from. I also don't believe in an eternal reward vs. punishment afterlife.|`|dZFwQPsGaa	No--although all religions can have some of the truth.    When you look at truth, logically, you cannot have contradictory statements.  For example, there cannot both exist God and at the same time have God not exist.  One has to be true.  If God does exist, then at least the major monotheistic religions are right.    Looking at Jesus--It is not a question as to whether or not he exists--most credible historians agree that he did.  he question is, was he really the Son of God, or someone else.  He cannot be both the Son of God and not.  Only one can be true.  If he is the Son of God, then Christianity is correct.  If he is not, then Judaism or the Muslim faiths are correct.    Eventually, it will come down to one faith being "correct", and the other faiths as having some or most of the Truth, but not all of the Truth.    EDIT:We are indeed on a journey, and there can only be ONE TRUTH.  You will have to figure out what that is.|`|3oNcHdgCaa	True.  I don't see any reason why somebody would pick one religion over another, except as a matter of personal preference or because of which culture they were born in and what their parents taught them.

The sheer statistical impossibility of evolution is lost on those who refuse to acknowledge God. There are over 350 billion galaxies in the known universe, our galaxy is a speck in the big picture, but on the outer edges of that cloud of stars known as The Milky Way, lies our own infinitesimal solar system. The third planet from the sun is our own microscopic earth ~ that just so happens to be tilted perfectly on its axis, rotating at precisely the right speed, and orbiting the sun at the ideal rate and distance in order for the earth to be habitable. Our atmosphere is the right thickness, our air is the right mixture, and the plants and the oceans work together in concert in order to make the perfect environment needed to support life. Then there are the countless life forms that fill this planet, and then there is man.<br>  <br>  The Godless man peers through his telescopes and his microscopes and convinces himself that he knows how it all came to be , and then he proclaims that God doesn't exist. He would have us all believe that the unfathomable enormity of it all just happened by itself. Matter came from nowhere, a big bang occurred without cause, and the delicate balance of all we see and know happened per chance through millions of years of the evolution of the species.<br>  <br>  You have to have pearls to give in order to cast them before swine my friend.

Hope something in it helps someone. <br>  I believe in God, that is my faith at work. I accept the reality of evolution. Faith is not involved in that.<br>  The time frame that the planet, solar system and stars took to form in “creation” is not any part of evolutionary theory.  Cosmology is not Biology.<br>  Intelligent Design, Creationism, whatever euphemisms they wish to name the Genesis story of creation in attempt to interject religious dogma into public schools under the guise of science, simply does not work as science. This is why it has failed and shall continue to fail in any court to be considered an “alternative” to a scientific theory. Scientific Method is what determines if something is science or not. The theory of evolution is as true as germ theory, gravitational theory, and other theories of physics and math that enabled you to type your question here for display on the internet to people all over the world.<br>  I am a Registered Nurse.   The abysmal level of science literacy in this country is extremely disturbing to me. Ignorance CAN harm you when those who may not share your ethics use it in ways that may harm you or the environment.  On one level, genetic testing for many debilitating diseases can be life-saving and wonderful to help advance quality of life for millions, however, there are growing fears that it may be leading to insurance companies denying you coverage benefits! Genetic testing is just one of the things that have come about because of an APPLICATION of processes at work in evolutionary theory.<br>  Frankenfoods, (genetic engineering in our food supply) and cloning are also things have come about only through understanding of evolutionary theory. That is exactly what the discoverers of those processes attribute to their ability to achieve their predictions and make those new discoveries. <br>  We have also made great strides in discovering the causes and getting treatments for diseases through application of evolutionary theory. We would not even be concerned at all about a possible mutated bird flu pandemic if evolution did not happen.<br>  Please do not start the macro and micro evolution argument. Those terms only apply to time scale if used at all by biologists.  Enough *micro* changes over time and you end up with a population that cannot reproduce with the earlier form and then you have "macro"...a new species. Not all evolutionary changes lead to speciation. Most do not. Evolution also does NOT imply direction or advancement of any form. Some changes are beneficial for survival potential, others are benign (most in fact) and some lead to disadvantages in survival potential and lead to "evolutionary dead ends". <br>  Evolution is a cornerstone to understanding modern biology and medicine. It is imperative that anyone who plans to pursue any career in healthcare or biology understand a process that affects every living organism. As long as there is reproduction with exchange of genetic material, evolution happens. It doesn't require "believing in" but accepting the observed and tested reality. There has been absolutely NO debate in scientific circles over the reality of evolution for nearly 70 years. What IS debated in Biology are various means and methods and intricate details of the many processes at work IN evolution. We know more about how evolution works than we do about GRAVITY. This "debate" between fundamentalist literalists and the scientific and medical community is NO different from the early medieval church condemning astronomers who put forth the notions of a heliocentric solar system.<br>  Creationism and Intelligent Design are not science. The ideas at work cannot be applied to scientific method. They are not falsifiable, they make no predictions. This is why it fails in court EVERY time as an "alternative" view in a science curriculum. It is NOT science. Science is a method and not an entity. Scientific method does not address God belief, so it is only atheistic to the aspect that it does not address any faith in any deity one way or another. That is because we have no objective physical evidence to apply to the steps of scientific method to determine one way or another the reality of an Omnipotent Creator. Until that time, faith, belief, religion...are outside of scientific method.<br>  There is no belief, meaning faith, required for evolution to be accepted as real. <br>  Neither is it the case that evolution as a biologic theory, threatens or denies the existence of an Omnipotent Creator Deity. Scientific method does not apply to this issue because we have no objective data to put to the method to determine one way or another.<br>  Evolution isn't a threat to belief in an Omnipotent Creator. It is a threat to the SELF-CONCEPT held by people who accept certain religious beliefs that formed such a self-concept in their adherents. My faith in God is not threatened by scientific method. My faith teaches me to test what I know to make sure it is real. If there is an aspect of dogma that I accept and it becomes threatened by objective evidence, perhaps that is an aspect of belief that should be challenged.<br>  Biology shows us that rather than life appearing on the planet *poof* in six literal days, as long as life exists, creation continues!<br>  Biology does not support or negate a God. <br>  The same Torah that the Genesis creation story came out of is the same Torah those fundamentalist literalists deny in their commandments! They will argue viciously for the creation story but just as harshly argue that the "Old" (eternal it says in the scripture) Testament has been "done away with" or "nailed to the cross". Religious dogma has no place in a science class.<br>  IMHO it is NOT faith in God that is *threatened* in the fundamentalist literalist, but their SELF-CONCEPT! I tested this over a number of years in chat rooms. ONLY VERY RARELY (and only after they heard my rationale) would any "Creationist" say YES to the following Yes or NO only simple question.<br>  Are you an animal?<br>  Most people will of course, say YES. Sometimes they will qualify it that our soul or spirit is different or that we have greater abilities, etc..but we are still animals. Almost all Creationists will give a knee jerk reaction that NO, we are human, we are above animals.<br>  When the very rare Creationist said "yes", it was ALWAYS with the qualifier that we are above and separate from all other animals. Well that wasn't the question..but at least they recognized they were animals.<br>  Our psyche is a wondrous thing. If our self-concept is threatened, the self-protective mechanism of DENIAL kicks in to prohibit the shattering of self to be replaced by one that is unacceptable to them. That EXPLAINS why they simply cannot see the literal mountains of observable, tested, verified, physical evidence that is SO VERY PLAIN to see to those whose self-concept is NOT threatened to KNOW that they too are an animal affected by the same biologic processes at work in all life. They are unable to consciously process things that would replace their self-concept with one that is degrading to them. So many of them are completely revolted by the notion that they are an animal. I do not see it as degrading. In fact, I can find spiritual wonderment and awe in knowing I am connected to all life on the planet. Nevertheless, that is just my own personal bent, that opinion has no bearing on the science involved to show me that connection.<br>  If you are indoctrinated to believe that humans are SEPARATE and ABOVE ALL other life and NOT connected to it..then THAT is why you cannot appear to grasp evolution (that is if you ever tried to learn what it is rather than what your preacher told you it was) Evolution shows that humans are all related, related to one another and to all life forms..we are bipedal primate mammals and we are still evolving as a species. That is a fact, not up for debate. <br>  Sometimes that self-protective mechanism is very helpful; in this instance, it impedes knowledge. There is NOTHING degrading about acceptance of our biologic mortal physical self. Our very thoughts are electro-chemical processes. I believe that an Omnipotent Creator set every process at work in the universe in place. That isn't my place in a science course to try to teach that, it makes no difference if one is atheist or theist in a science classroom; objective data is something that can be seen and tested by ALL. <br>  Scientific method is the best method yet devised by the human mind to determine if something is real or not. This is why theories change when new evidence comes into play. That is what makes it SCIENCE. Creationism/ID is religious dogma. It cannot be tested, it cannot be changed, and to do so is heresy. It is religion. <br>  Religion is belief in a deity with dogma and a method to seek to find meaning beyond our mere mortal life existence and find connection on a spiritual level and to fulfill purpose of existence. Science is a method, steps to discover knowledge of the universe. It primarily answers questions of why and how, not who. <br>  One may seek and find knowledge by using both in their life. I do and I understand their differences and their limitations to connect to one another. <br>  Homo sapiens has become Homo technos. We have lost something since we have gained technology. Our human ancestors once recognized our connections to all other life. Now we separate ourselves, and not to our psychological benefit, I might add. I try to look at this from a holistic perspective.<br>  Since we do have greater technologic capacity and ability to manipulate our environment, it makes the case for damning the human species all the greater. With our greater skills, we should be greater caretakers of this earth we have "dominion" over.|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	First, you make an assumption that if it is not true it is a deception of God.  Could it not simply be a method of winnowing?  Second, there are not a whole lot of transitional fossils.  The closest I know of is the archeopteryx and that could simply be just another animal and not the in between.  <br>  <br>  At my dentist office there is a poster that says "there remains a beauty that is yet undiscovered."  Imagine beauties abound us that we do not even know about that God has created for our benefit.  True it could be as you say God created through evolution or it could be just a well planed creator that made everything perfect.

The "thrown down to earth" part was from the begining before the earth was created. Satan was one of the most beautiful angels out of the three other angels. Every angel looked up to Satan because he/she was the most beautiful. But because everyone admired him/her, he/she thought that he/she could become God. This made God angry and so He punished him and banished him from Heaven therefore he went to Hell. Many of the other angels that admired him/her followed him/her down to hell therefore they became his servant or "ghost".|`|a2fd4e08f6fcd82f91c7b76de5c16fd1aa	Angels that came to the earth pre flood went back when the flood came.  At that point they were in heaven still.  In the account of Job it talks about Satan going in before God.  So he had to still be in heaven.      Revelation then talks about woe to the earth because the devil has been hurled down.      The quick answer is, some time after the flood, Witnesses believe that to be in 1914, Satan and his angels were kicked out of heaven by Jesus as the newly enthroned King.      Hope it helps.|`|atfKCzmPaa	However, when certain materialized angels indulged in the pleasure of sex in the days of Noah, they were expelled from Jehovahs heavenly courts. Here was a display of angelic individuality, for, like humankind, they too are free moral agents, with the power of personal choice between right and wrong. (Ge 6:2,?4; 2Pe 2:4) By personal choice, hordes of angels joined Satan in his rebellion.Re 12:7-9; Mt 25:41.    Who were the sons of God that fathered the Nephilim?  Who were the sons of the true God that were involved? Were they men who were worshipers of Jehovah (as distinguished from the general run of wicked mankind), as some claim? Evidently not. The Bible implies that their marriage to the daughters of men resulted in whipping up the badness in the earth. Noah and his three sons, along with their wives, were the only ones in Gods favor and were the only ones preserved through the Deluge.Ge 6:9; 8:15,?16; 1Pe 3:20.  Hence, if these sons of the true God were merely men, the question arises, Why were their offspring men of fame more than those of the wicked, or of faithful Noah? Also, the question might be asked, Why mention their marriage to the daughters of men as something special? Marriage and childbearing had been taking place for more than 1,500 years. The sons of God mentioned at Genesis 6:2, therefore, must have been angels, spirit sons of God. This expression is applied to angels at Job 1:6; 38:7. This view is supported by Peter, who speaks of the spirits in prison, who had once been disobedient when the patience of God was waiting in Noahs days. (1Pe 3:19,?20) Also Jude writes of the angels that did not keep their original position but forsook their own proper dwelling place. (Jude 6) Angels had the power to materialize in human form, and some angels did so to bring messages from God. (Ge 18:1, 2, 8, 20-22; 19:1-11; Jos 5:13-15) But heaven is the proper abode of spirit persons, and the angels there have positions of service under Jehovah. (Da 7:9,?10) To leave this abode to dwell on earth and to forsake their assigned service to have fleshly relations would be rebellion against Gods laws, and perversion.  The Bible states that the disobedient angels are now spirits in prison, having been thrown into Tartarus and reserved with eternal bonds under dense darkness for the judgment of the great day. This seems to indicate that they are greatly restricted, unable again to materialize as they did prior to the Flood.1Pe 3:19; 2Pe 2:4; Jude 6.    the land of Magog clearly has a symbolic significance. The fact that the term Scythian, with which Magog is usually associated, came to be used as a synonym for that which is brutal and degraded would logically seem to point to a fallen state or position of debasement, analogous to the position assigned to Satan and his angels following the war in heaven and from which debased position he wrathfully wages war with the remaining ones of [the womans] seed, as described at Revelation 12:7-17.See GOG No. 2.    In the book of Revelation, we find described the last days of Satan and his end. Revelation reports that at the time of Christs taking Kingdom power, Satan is hurled down out of heaven to the earth, no longer having access to the heavens, as he did in the days of Job and for centuries thereafter. (Re 12:7-12) After this defeat Satan has only a short period of time, during which he makes war with the remaining ones of [the womans] seed, who observe the commandments of God and have the work of bearing witness to Jesus.     After examining the foregoing from the faithful slave it should be obvious that Satan and the demons have been in spiritual darkness alienated from God and the light he sheds on those who properly worship Him. This would have been the case from the very moment they forsook their proper positions and left heaven to have relations with women. After the flood they also could no longer leave the spirit realm. They still had access to heaven as is indicated by the account in Job as the brothers have mentioned.

DfDss68haa	I agree with you, they are hypocrites. Unfortunately, as you can see from some of these answers, many people are still ignorant about homosexuality. They do not believe being gay is a biological real thing and they think it is a choice.    You and me know different. Being gay is normal and real and, actually at this point, gets discriminated against more than black people. As black people we do not have to argue with people who think being black is "wrong". Can you imagine someone telling a black person to   "Stop trying to be black. Why can't you be white like your sister? I'm sure being black is just a phase or all in your head. We are going to send you to a Jesus camp so they can teach you it's a sin to be a black. Being black is a choice."    At this point in history it's pretty much accepted by everyone that nobody chooses to be black, we just are. But sadly, gay people have these conversations everyday and many of them are taught they can be converted to straight and that gay is some type of sin. This mentality is definitely present in the black community who are heavily religious traditionally. I do think it's sad that people who have fought so hard for our own rights are now denying other people their rights. Of course black people alone did not vote in Proposition 8 and others banning gay marriage but we helped. Also you can't say all black people are against homosexuality becuase gays can be black and blacks can be gay. The two demographics often overlap. You can't seperate gay and black anymore than you can seperate straight and black. Those blacks against gay marriage rationalize it by saying that being straight is the only real sexuality. Sad.     I am a black person voted for gay marriage in Florida. I am sad it didn't get passed. Keep fighting the good fight!    EDIT: As KK said, I think the wording of the propositions were confusing. It contained a double negative. Prop. 2 here in Florida was definitely worded very suspiciously. I almost voted against gay marriage, it was that confusing. I think we should ask for a recount.|`|EmOnt7FIaa	Please don't blame black people for denying you marriage because I'm sure just as much black people are against gay marriage as whites. Also, there is nothing in the Constitution that says Gay people can not run for Public Office.|`|8MzVCzi0aa	you are seriously comparing sexuality to humanity ?|`|OT4SrmDXaa	Blacks did not Choose to have black skin. Gays choose to have sex with eachother. Because there are a alot of black christians who don't aprove of your lifestlye and special rights you demand.    You have the same rights as blacks and whites. You can marry a black or white man if your a woman and a black or white woman if you are a man.    Don't confuse blacks skin color with your sin.|`|FKxrJxbPaa	Are you seriously comparing being black to being gay? No no nononononono....    Personally i dont think two guys should "marry" since marriage is as much a religious institution as it is a spiritual one...however if they want civil unions that grant them the same legal rights as married couples i'm in support of that.     But to compare being black to being gay is ludicrious. Unless you're flamboyantly gay to the point that it irritates people...chances are people are not gonna negatively judge you for being homo. i dont remember the last time a gay dude couldnt catch a cab or was denied the right to vote. Gays could get up and decide they dont wanna f*ck men in the @ss or wear ridiculously tight clothing....i cant simply jump outta the skin i'm in.|`|AA11644082	Your information is false.

Personally, I don't like to be around gays (just like most non-Blacks don't really want to be around us Blacks).

Open-mindedness is a two-way steet..|`|EXurNsB4aa	Don't spout misinformation.  Evangelical Christians and Mormons launched a very well-financed campaign to promote Prop. 8 in the guise that gay marriage destroys nuclear families.    It was a failure of the No on Prop 8 campaign to reach out to black communities, not an inherent dislike or hatred of gay rights coming from black people.  The data showed that mostly older generations of black (and other) people were most likely to vote in favor of Prop 8.    Furthermore, black voters only accounted for ten percent of the vote altogether in California.  They alone did not pass prop 8.  Not even close.|`|iad9mqaXaa	We didn't vote for proposition 8. The majority, whites in California, gave the passing votes. But you people seem to deny that.    There are only about 6.2% Blacks in California, so I know their votes didn't past prop 8. And I'm sure all of the California blacks, didn't go in and vote for this thing. Stop lying.|`|S7IJ5hhCaa	yea some black people probably did vote yes on 8.  but so did some white people &mexican people.    if anyone,blame it on the mormons  theyre the ones who posted yes on 8 signs all around the neighborhood|`|Q7EN2Zqbaa	We all want our rights, so that would make anyone who voted against it a hypocrite then.  I think the issue is that a lot of people consider it a religious institution and don't want the definition changed for the reason that it's sacred or something.  I'm kind of on the fence with it as it is, I'm not religious but like a lot of people I think a good compromise would be for them to enjoy all the rights and privileges of marriage legally, even have the ceremony etc. but leave God out of it.    Edit: Just to note, there's no existing proof that being gay is genetic.  Meaning you can say people are born gay, and it might be true, but you're still going on faith. I've never been president either come to think of it, or attorney general! You guys are all anti-johnnyists!|`|itpbH1EAaa	Hey, not all blacks have issues with being gay.

But what I can't tolerate is people spewing misinformation!    Blacks did Not pass the Prop 8 law alone and could Not have done it without the enormous help of Evangelical Christians and Mormons who funded the whole thing...    Yes some blacks without a doubt voted against it (some for religious reasons which is No Excuse) but You have to get your facts rights before post something like this. Majority of the blame does Not belong here (with blacks)...sorry point the finger elsewhere!    If you're getting your opinion from FoxNews trying educating yourself through other mediums because You'll only make an @ss of yourself in intelligent conversations!|`|2gyJUTzRaa	Why did MOST African-Americans vote to deny basic civil rights to gay people? - that's the question you should be asking...otherwise you're generalizing an entire race.    The main reasons are religion and education.  The highest demographics of people voting to ban gay marriage are Evangelical Christians, and people with only a high school degree or less.  Educated blacks, and non religious blacks, in general support gay marriage.  Same with people of any other race.    And I agree the black people who vote to deny rights of others ARE hypocrites...and jerks.  The fact that there's even a ballot for stuff like this is ridiculous.  I mean this just means we can have a ballot to bring segregation back.  As a society, we need to get over our differences and accept the fact that we all are equal.    And being gay and black ARE comparable to anyone with a brain.  If that offends you, then you're a homophobe and need to get over yourself.  People get shot and denied jobs for being gay.  People get shot and denied jobs for being black.  Then they're both discriminated in different ways...for example blacks had segregation.  BUT in the holocaust, gays were sent to concentration camps alongside Jews.  Either way, it's discrimination and all forms are bad.|`|cLgghhuXaa	Because Black people are more conservative than many people think... in the Black community, the church is still held in high esteem. And you KNOW the battles the Gay community has had with the church. FYI... for those Black conservatives the comparison of being Black and being gay is an insult. One is born with a certain color skin, (and I realize that many people believe one is born gay BUT there are those who disagree.)    Also many people think the wording of Prop 8 confused a lot of people...    **Edit: a funny thing too... the Black church (and Muslim leaders) had a LOT to do with organizing the Civil Rights Movement... but given what the Bible and Qu'ran say regarding homosexuality, I doubt gays will see their support.    ***Edit2: "Have we ever had a gay President, Secretary of State or attorney General?" Perhaps closeted gay... there are historians who think President James Buchanan was a closeted gay.|`|uQfJukisaa	I completely support gay marriage it's just most black people being strong christians and/or raised in a homophobic household don't believe the same thing. For the most part black people voted against gay marriage mostly because of how they were raised and their religion.       It's also not just the black people it's all the homophobes and christians in general.|`|kM4D8e4Aaa	Right, it was only black people that voted for Prop 8.|`|3QNwf2eMaa	It was mainly the Christians and Mormons that voted against it.

Jesus is a "He".<br>  <br>  Are you sure you have read the Bible.<br>  Try John 3:16 for a starter.<br>  <br>  I sincerely hope you won't turn your back on God simply because some people are confused about Him (or about themselves). You don't refuse to believe in the law just because you hear about a corrupt judge, nor should you refuse to believe in God just because you meet someone who is confused about Him.<br>  <br>  Anyone can claim to be God, but you rightly put your finger on the real issue: What evidence is there to support their claim? The answer is clear: none. But Jesus Christ was different, and the reason is because He not only claimed to be God, but also His whole life was a witness to its truth. Because of that, He alone could truthfully say, "I and the Father are one" (John 10:30).<br>  <br>  What evidence is there for Jesus' divinity? The first is that of His sinless life -- something only God could do. The Bible says Jesus was "tempted in every way, just as we are -- yet was without sin" (Hebrews 4:15). Then there is the evidence of His miracles -- miracles that demonstrated the power of God.<br>  <br>  But the final proof of Jesus' divine nature was His resurrection from the dead. Anyone could claim to be the Son of God, but only Christ proved it by coming back from the grave -- an event witnessed by hundreds. Who was Jesus Christ? He was God in human flesh -- and He came into this world for one reason: to save us from our sins. Why not open your heart to Him today?|`|IEaBjLmOaa	Jesus is defiantly real.

See #Ge 4:4,5. In the account in Genesis of the offering made by Abel, there is no mention of faith —as is true also indeed of most of the instances referred to by the apostle. The account in Genesis is, simply, that Abel "brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering." Men have speculated much as to the reason why the offering of Abel was accepted, and that of Cain rejected; but such speculation rests on no certain basis, and the solution of the apostle should be regarded as decisive and satisfactory, that in the one case there was faith, in the other not. It could not have been because an offering of the fruits of the ground was not pleasing to God, for such an offering was commanded under the Jewish law, and was not in itself improper. Both the brothers selected that which was to them most obvious; which they had reared with their own hands; which they regarded as most valuble. Cain had cultivated the earth, and he naturally brought what had grown under his care; Abel kept a flock, and he as naturally brought what he had raised: and had the temper of mind in both been the same, there is no reason to doubt that the offering of each would have been accepted. To this conclusion we are led by the nature of the case, and the apostle advances substantially the same sentiment—for he says that the particular state of mind on which the whole turned was, that the one had faith and the other not. How the apostle himself was informed of the fact, that it was faith which made the difference, he has not informed us. The belief that he was inspired will, however, relieve the subject of this difficulty—for, according to such a belief, all his statements here, whether recorded in the Old Testament or not, are founded in truth. It is equally impossible to tell with certainty what was the nature of the faith of Abel. It has been commonly asserted that it was faith in Christ—looking forward to his coming, and depending on his sacrifice when offering that which was to be a type of him. But of this there is no positive evidence, though, from Heb 12:24, it seems to be not Abel. Sacrifice, as a type of the Redeemer's great offering, was instituted early in the history of the world. There can be no reason assigned for the offering of blood as an atonement for sin, except that it had originally a reference to the great atonement which was to be made by blood; and as the salvation of man depended on this entirely, it is probably that would be one of the truths which would be first communicated to man after the fall. The bloody offering of Abel is the first of the kind which is definitely mentioned in the Scriptures, (though it is not improbAbel that such sacrifices were offered by Adam, comp. #Ge 3:21,) and consequently Abel may be regarded as the recorded head of the whole typical system, of which Christ was the antitype and the fulfilment. See Barnes "Heb 12:24".<br>  <br>  That is to say, there is no mention of faith involved in the offerings either in Hebrews or in Genesis. The account is simply that two men brought two different offerings to the Lord. We are simply told that one offering was more excellent than the other – we can only speculate why this was so. The problem cannot be that one was the fruit of the ground, for such fruit offering was a required offering after Moses. See Leviticus 1,  Both brothers brought to the Lord what was the most valuble to him. However, it is not that Abel, and even Adam, looked forward to the coming atonement for sin in his sacrifice, and that atonement revealed to Adam after the fall. But that is not the context.<br>  <br>  Neither the Genesis nor Hebrews context tells us that God mentioned a blood offering for sin at this point. Such an assumption must be read into the passage, based upon what we know of the required blood offering after Moses. However, we do know from the context that each man brought the results of the produce of his own occupation, which was permissible even after Moses gave the law. Exodus 23, 34, Leviticus 2.<br>  <br>  Thus, God's rejection was not over the lack of a "blood" sacrifice; rather, the rejection was over the attitude of the heart which motivated the offerings. Abel's "heart" motivated him to bring the first and the best, while Cain's "heart" motivated him to simply bring of the fruit of the ground with little or no though of what was the first and the best. The judgment was over the attitude of the heart, for these were "thanksgiving" offerings.<br>  <br>  Abel's more excellent offering reflected his thankfulness to the Lord, while Cain's offering reflected his indifference to the Lord: he did what was expected, and no more. Evidently, both men knew what God required, or neither would have offered. Thus, it was the motive behind the offering that God rejected. Paul tells us that a lack of proper thankfulness shows we are not glorifying God as God. Romans 1:21.|`|AA10057370	quite interpretative.<br>  <br>  Cain killed his brother.|`|trMsK86jaa	Nice symbol.<br>  <br>  Looks like something i made myself subconsciously draw once, thought it was sort of like a nephilim symbol at the time or something.|`|AA12193600	probably the biggest effect on humanity if your a bible thumper is only having their mother to mate with early on.|`|5OucqEzFaa	(1) How does this interpretation of Cain & Abel affect society in the 21st Century? Badly.<br>  <br>  But that may be because the conclusions you draw based on what Augustine wrote cannot be substantiated. I'm absolutely fine with your first two sentences. But Christianity denounces antisemitism, the slave trade, the Holocaust or racial discrimination. Yes, history tells us that greedy, selfish and power-crazed men carried out the most awful atrocities and in the name of God. Please don't imagine for one moment that God condones their actions. Oh, and the suggestion that the death of Abel demands vengeance is completely and utterly wiped out by the sacrificial death of Jesus and the atonement for sin. We've moved on. Please do not take offence - I simply disagree with the conclusions you reach.<br>  <br>  (2) Have we learned from our mistakes? No.|`|AyPF2TFlaa	All I see is two brothers at war with each other. one being evil causing destruction and one wanting to live in peace to contemplate and enjoy.<br>  You seem to make Abel the aggressor.<br>  There's a long time used  war strategy  that is to infiltrate the enemy, these two are now inseparable from one another. <br>  Christ said to come out of them!<br>  Christ said be born again!<br>  Christ said I make creation new!<br>  Christ said offer the other cheek!<br>  This is the true nature of Abel.<br>  Even though Satan has mixed the Darnall in the wheat, still it's not hard to tell who is who as Christ said you will know by the fruit and when he comes he will separate the goats from the sheep. <br>  So to end you can't say here is cain and here is Abel because they are intertwined together.|`|AA11470972	Under these circumstances and their holyman interpretation, I can say their god is not a fair and comparson god.

57e1885bdade83593ff264411c902959aa	The name Lucifer belongs to Nebuchadnezzar who for 3 generations had dominion over the earth as known of at that time as the 3rd world ruler.       Satan filled the king of Babylon with the ambition to have complete domination over the earth, even over Jehovahs throne (1Ch 29:23) and the stars of God, the kings of the line of David sitting on the throne at Mount Moriah (by extension, Zion). This king, that is, the dynasty of Babylon, lifted himself up in his own heart and was in his own eyes and in the eyes of his admirers a shining one, a son of the dawn. (In some translations the Latin Vulgate term Lucifer is retained. It is, however, merely the translation of the Hebrew word heh?lel, shining one. Heh?lel is not a name or a title but, rather, a term describing the boastful position taken by Babylons dynasty of kings of the line of Nebuchadnezzar.) (Isa 14:4-21) Since Babylon was a tool of Satan, its king reflected Satans own ambitious desire. Again, Jehovah came to the salvation of his people by restoring them to their land, until the real Seed of promise should come.Ezr 1:1-6.|`|fkQWYStLaa	I'm not quite sure what the question is...? But yes, God gave satan the ability to go to Earth, however God is omnipresent. Satan can tempt us but God has promised that he will only allow us to be tempted as far as we are able to withstand.    Basically it means that while Satan is allowed to tempt us, we won't be tempted farther than what God expects us to be able to do.    Example: We're tempted to have sex. We have the ability to say no... some people just don't.    As for houses being doomed I don't think that's the case.

CvRMwulfaa	The argument that it is morally wrong depends upon what religion you are.  But in my mind, isn't it morally wrong to choose how another person loves someone else?  Who gave us the right to manipulate how other people live and love?  Comparing gay marriage to pedophiles marrying kids or anything like that is an absolutely incorrect argument...being a pedophile is a crime and felony, being gay isn't, and it's not like they are intending on hurting someone.  Some say it is morally wrong for two of the same sex to marry, I say it is morally wrong for someone else to say how someone should love somebody...especially in a place where equal rights is held so high.  By saying how someone should love you are giving yourself more power and more rights than another, and that is just wrong and unacceptable.|`|fDGlC403aa	Oh yeah .... the most important one -money.

This stems from our concept of equality which is enshrined in our Declaration of Independence and supported by various articles and amendments to our Constitution.  Now where I come from "all" means "all".  By denying marriage to gay couples we are also denying them each one of the 1138 rights automatically granted by our government to opposite-gender couples.  That doesn't seem very fair to me.    I know that some people have deep religious reservations about allowing gay people to marry.  That's fine.  Those people are entitled to their way of thinking.  At the same time, it is painfully inappropriate for them to inject their religious notions into the secular laws of our nation and to engage in every kind of lie and spreading of misinformation they can come up with to support their ideas, and thus promote hatred, fear and prejudice against an entire group of people.|`|JqHkgWROaa	I believe they should have that right.

Here are some reasons why:    1. Love is love, and love is a beautiful thing. As long as it is mutually consentual, it does not hurt anyone.    2. Denying people to have equal rights based on things such as sexual orientation is, indeed, quite disgusting. It is in no ways better than the former South-African Apartheid regime, and we do not want to go back to that, now, do we?    3. Refusing gay people the right to marry also has other implications, because they in turn get robbed of a whole lot of other rights, of which married straight couples already possess.    4. Just the fact that something has "always been" a certain way, does not mean it has to stay like that forever. Some people say marriage has "always been" between a man and a woman. Perhaps they are right when it comes to that! But, on the other hand, way back in time only men were allowed to vote. Up until 1913 (In Norway, which is my country), it had *always* been that way. However.. That does not mean it was wrong to change the law.    5. Gay marriage does not affect the straight couples in any way! Just think about it.. If I am allowed to marry Roxanne, how does that in any way make Susan's and Roger's marriage less valuable? They won't even notice the difference.    6. The religious right are against it because of their scripture and their holy books. However, you cannot mix religion with politics in a civil society! Their delusions should not affect anyone else! America is a secular country, not everybody is a Christian. Religious people have NO RIGHT to impose their beliefs on everyone else! Marriage, for once, is a social institution which regulates people's rights. It is not, and will never be, a religious one. (Even though it has a religious meaning in ADDITION, for quite a few American inhabitants.). Refusing people the right to marry, based on old superstitions only, is in no way defendable!|`|fQkb26jWaa	I've always wondered why you need the government's permission or recognition to enter into an intimate, lifelong agreement.  This proves to me that this issue is less about love and more about benefits.    The way to solve it is to allow marriage between any two consenting adults, but to eliminate the no-fault divorce under irreconcilable differences.  This "compromise" would help the institution of marriage become something again to be respected.|`|GW8LVWT8aa	i believe human rights applies to everyone, even to those you don't like.

Its part of their genome. Also common sense.    2)Environment children are raised in  A)With that logic we should also not allow single parents to keep their Children.    3)People don't want to see gayness on TV  A)well racists don't want to see black people or whatever race they are against on TV, but we don't do what they want.    4)Gay Marriage will be taught in schools  A)Did your school teach you about marriage? Didn't think so unless you went to Catholic school or equivalent.    My arguments:  1)Equality. By not allowing them to marry who they want to, you ware making them less then yourself, regardless of who they can marry.    2)Pursuit of Happiness. They are not impeding on your happiness, and you are impeding on theirs. Unless the fact that they can marry bothers you and impedes on your happiness, in which case I once again bring up race and also that that POV does not count and wouldn't hold up in a court of law.

I was told "well, you must have signed up for it because we wouldn't be charging you for it if you hadn't."  And then he went on to say, "you should have read the contract you signed" except I never signed any contract--and I've worked in law firms for the last 30 years so I know enough to read and understand everything before you sign.  He wanted to continue to argue about who's fault it is but I didn't have time so I just told him to shut up and take that charge off my account since I never signed up for it, don't need it and will not pay for it.    And isn't it nice to finally get a customer service person who is courteous and pleasant?  I feel like cooperating and we both apologize for taking up their time, etc.  And I come away feeling good about that company and don't put a silent hex on the whole organization (and from the way banks and companies are going out of business, my hexes must be working).  Companies really ought to train their people who come in contact with customers (not just the customer service dept) to use a little honey because they'd get better results and won't lose customers that way.
EnyhoOmTaa	Like go back to the barter system?     "Hi, I'd like to trade my goat for your shoes. Thanks."    Yeah, brilliant idea.
FKN9kBvLaa	I use to be a waiter for 4 years in a NICE restaurant, and some of the the church goers  where like that.  Some of them actually left prayer books as tips when they were in town for conventions (New Orleans).  But never anything quite that bad, I would have given them a very "unholy" response to that one.  But honestly, even though  they weren't good tippers, most of them weren't so bad to waite on.  I commend your manager for what he did, it was the right thing to do because technically, they don't have to tip, and as a manager, he can't make people leave for not tipping.|`|WAoNhHB1aa	I'm a Christian and I would have tipped her.  I work on Sunday sometimes.  Being in school and sometimes having weekend homework, I have to sometimes!  I ain't doing it all on Saturday and Friday!|`|iVv6bFW2aa	No,not all. The Unitarians, Quakers and Mennonites are peace churches and oppose discrimination.Also the believers in the Hispanic Theology of Liberation.|`|wS3oR0U7aa	One of them should have said something like "I don't believe in cheap Christians being hungry on Sunday."|`|Q7EN2Zqbaa	That's totally rude of them, no they're not all like that at all.|`|AA11462629	thats cute|`|LFwQPrxbaa	I think that those were some VERY ILL-MANNERED people who happened to be Christians.      Jesus certainly wouldn't have done that and I think the manager did the right thing!    Depending on how far you want to take it, it would be interesting to find out which church they belong to and contacting the minister.  It would certainly be a worthwhile topic for an upcoming sermon!|`|UFyK8fpraa	no|`|OT4SrmDXaa	They deserved to get thrown out as there were not acting like christians. That self rightousness the bible talks about. There judemental fools.|`|2gyJUTzRaa	Aw that manager was nice.  I wouldn't tell the manager though...I'd just piss in their food.|`|cLgghhuXaa	As a former waitress/hostess I HATE BAD TIPS! As a Christian who is a former waitress/hostess... I can NOT believe the nerve of that group.    If you don't believe in working on Sundays then do not force the people to work by patronizing an establishment open on Sundays.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No they are not it is none of their business.
LVZdzPmpaa	Whenever anyone says something that could be prefaced with "You know what you need . . . . ?" that's a clue to turn around and head the other direction.    Who gets to pronounce that another person is boring AND then determine that "I WANT you to be happy and have more fun?" What does it matter what this person wants? What matter is what the individual wants, not what someone else wants for him.    It's all fine and dandy at first, then the "you know how you can improve . . . ?" starts up. It's nonsense. If everyone would mind his own business, he wouldn't have time to worry about the business of everyone else.     Anybody who listens to this sort of rubbish needs to take a long, hard look at why s/he has no self-esteem.|`|4eTyCuRSaa	I would take it as friendly advice and find a way to make myself more interesting.|`|PuWucUs3aa	he just want you to cheer up! dont feel bad.|`|pcHCLfZkaa	Heh, you think that hurt?    Try finding out today that your big crush, who for sure you thought liked you, turned out to be straight..    Boy, what a day breaker.|`|ig6qg2R4aa	I'd be really hurt. That's kinda mean! I used to be shy, so people would always tell me to be more outgoing, have more fun, stop being so shy. I started talking to new people, worked on my self-esteem, now people think I'm fun and crazy, people just love me, so, really, all you have to do is make yourself more out there. If you're low on self-esteem, work towards making you feel happy about yourself, and being more fun will come along the way.|`|tIJCQ0XQaa	I'm sorry you got hurt. =(  I would be bothered too cuz I think I am a boring person...  so if someone told me that I would believe it and be more sad... X(|`|sOeDTrPeaa	He likes you. He is just saying that you should be more out going. nothing wrong with what he said just the way he said it|`|Y9GdwvnWaa	i completely understand b/c i have said this to my partner. he just wants you to open up a little come out of your shell with him! he didnt mean anything wrong by it.
DTog0VZWaa	I don't know what "mainstream" refers to.  All the branches that are accepted in Judaism are part of it.    Female Rabbis are ordained & lead congregations in the Reconstructionist, Reform & Conservative movements in the US & Liberal (Reform) in Europe.  The Orthodox will allow women to study for it, but not lead a congregation.  However, there is much discussion going on in the that community on how to integrate women more fully while staying with in hallacha.    To clariify:  Hassidic & Haredi are subgroups of Orthodox, along with Modern Orthodox & others.  Rabbinic Judaism is what is called Judaism - includes using Talmud.  Humanistic Judaism is a very new movement in the U.S. that is not officially accepted & is finding it's feet.  Karaite Judaism branched off way back more than a millenia ago, are small in number by the low thousands & don't follow what most of Judaism does - such as Talmud.  Samaritan generally don't consider themselves Jewish (according to writings I've seen by them).  Sometimes they are referred to that way, but usually not.|`|AA11690436	Yes.  Reform Judaism is considered a mainstream branch,and many reform rabbis are women.|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: Yes, Conservative (I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, guys) and Reform Judaism allow women Rabbis.|`|NI0cNU22aa	Orthodox women cannot become rabbis. When I see a woman wearing a kippah (very rare, but happens occasionally with American tourists) I can't help but stare. It's really weird. Apparently it is common in American Jewry.|`|425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	Don't forget the Reconstructionist movement. I know several women rabbis.|`|GMFXD1ENaa	Orthodoxy is the only form of Judaism in which women are not ordained, but women are becoming progressively active in aspects of Orthodoxy that were previously limited to rabbis. Some consider this to be a step towards the ordination of women.|`|LatNwF5Qaa	Reform Judaism does for sure, my Rabbi is a woman.|`|DBONYpVkaa	Almost all branches except Orthodox allow them. Most people think of Judaism as 3 branches: Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform. This is not true, however. There are other branches such as Haredi Judaism, Hasidic Judaism, Modern Orthodox Judaism (which differs from Orthodox), Reconstructionist Judaism, Renewal Judaism, Rabbinic Judaism, Humanistic Judaism, Karaite Judaism, and Samaritanism. However, those 3 main are the major groups. Yes, Conservative allows them, to whoever asked, I go to a Conservative synagogue (I'd be going to a Reform one if my family wasn't Conservative) and my Rabbi is a woman, so yes. Ugh, SOME Orthodox are so annoying and hate the idea of female rabbis, one guy on YouTube even put rabbi in quotes when I told him I had a female rabbi, (ie. he said female "rabbi", as in she can't be a Rabbi). Before this rabbi came to my synagogue, we leaned towards Orthodox and even had a few Orthodox families, but now we have no Orthodox families and lean more towards Reform, but keep the Conservative positions.    Oh, and RJ, yes that is rare. It is not required for women to wear kippot in Conservative Judaism, although it is not frowned upon. My Rabbi wears a kippah, but it is not common for a non-Rabbi Conservative/Reform Jewish woman to wear a kippah just anywhere (ie. in a public setting).
xD3g4wsqaa	I suppose it's because they know the mistakes their kids made. They think something they think is right will work. However, I really get annoyed by the people who try to give children advice and they themselves don't even have kids. Take for example, when I had my son, our pediatrician was so trying to push us to raise him like they taught him in medical school. Like there was book we had to followed in that exact order. Now, he has his own son we joke about what he used to tell us, he's lighten up a lot. So yeah, those are the worse and I feel how you do. But I do like when we are eating out and a lot of older folks come and tell us that we have such well behaved children we have.
c5VABL0oaa	Sure, because THAT'S what Jesus would do...         It's their right, but that doesn't mean that their intolerance doesn't make me sick.|`|AA11503457	Yes, and similarly I wouldn't have a problem with a private lesbian school expelling Christians if that violated their charter.  But never fear, our incompetent state supreme court is bound to overturn the ruling, who knows if scotus will manage to correct them.|`|dz5Og81Qaa	I think they are jumping to conclusions since they supposedly teach their students to love one another. Otoh, these 2 girls should realize how things appear and not get too demonstrative in public. This applies whether or not they are just friends or really are lesbians. After all isn't the sin the sexual activity and not the love?     The school need to practice what it preaches and love the (supposed) sinners and hate the sin. This would be a good opportunity for a teaching moment instead of sticking their collective heads in the sand.|`|L1HVLylMaa	It is. At home you set the rules    You don't like them, don't go|`|pbTtiPqOaa	As a person in fellowship with the churches that own the school, I applaud their decision. I thank God that freedom of religion is here in America. If they hadn't done this I would not be happy because not doing anything about it is basically saying that conduct doesn't matter. It does. I find it kind of odd that the couple didn't just say no they weren't lesbians but then they decided to not say anything about their orientation, but that's besides the point. If a heterosexual student couple was caught having sex they would have been expelled, so there really is no case here.|`|E71jweytaa	yes it is, its there own private school and yeah, they have the right to expel whoever they want. just as the boy scouts do|`|H7L66ynJaa	I feel this is good and worthy of commendation|`|WxlwpEDbaa	As a lesbian?    Indifferent.|`|UmZznLuhaa	They can stay at my house for private tutoring instead ;-)|`|FDVuAiHOaa	It's not right, but it's their right.|`|HIskrREJaa	i think it's sad.. but they are right in it being a private institution.... if it was a public school then it would be different. personally, i wouldn't want to send my school that teaches intolerance.|`|JqHkgWROaa	Private schools have the right to practice intolerance and prejudicey, thats one of the gimmicks of being privately owned.|`|o4UrRbTvaa	Anyone going to a fundie school must abide by their fundie rules.      Maybe that should be their slogan, Lol|`|AA11264399	They should be turned over to secular authorities to run in a decent way.|`|h1eBWehMaa	private school with set rules of Christianity|`|eZbkg3BWaa	..It makes me feel glad *I* never went to a Christian high school!  Ohhh, and it also makes me see them as hypocritical douchebags.    Yay, Christianity!!  The religion of (conditional) "love"...    ..I rest my case.|`|WalnRzfGaa	being a private school it is their right.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Private schools may do as they wish. Their decision may be ignorant, but it is legal. No religious organization should be forced to do something that is against their beliefs.    The young women in question would be better off in a school that doesn't pry into their sexual orientation.|`|vxSXsn59aa	The more people they turn away from religion, the closer we get to a world free of it.|`|Ynsow6qbaa	That private schools have contracts.|`|hjxsX4liaa	That is horrible  : (|`|PRAd6MWwaa	hell no that's not right  let people just live their lives..gaaahhhh|`|QqxZzvbAaa	it's a private school they can do what they want.  they don't take government money so it is legal.  so what?|`|7cLYgf2raa	That is called freedom of religion. Why would homos want to go to a christian school anyway?The bible they teach says that homosexuals are an abomination.Why wouldn't they just go to the secular government schools where anything goes.They have already thumbed their noses at what the bible teaches.|`|PkBMMvqTaa	is a private school...rules there differ.|`|v6vYmceSaa	Jesus probably wouldn't have done this, so no, it most likely isn't right.|`|JjoBtLjbaa	No way no how even if its a private institution. That's DISCRIMINATION.|`|XTyAMS5yaa	Is it right? No...HELL no...but it is their right as a privately funded school to accept or expel whoever they like....
oTwymgpIaa	Well, you have a good head on your shoulders. Your right you don't need a partner, it just complicates things, maybe later when you have more control over your life you will feel differently or maybe not. You are very correct, it is important to find your own happiness before you worry about getting a partner, most kids are in such a rush to start a relationship without realizing it is their hormones playing with them, and they have no idea what love is really about. Keep up the good work and everything will work itself out in time. Your mom is just trying to get you started on the right track, take advantage of her advice while she is there because she might not be there one day. Don't worry, as long as you continue to focus on whats in your best interest and keep your head out of the clouds, everything will fall in place, it just takes time. The meaning of life is to enjoy it and experience it, other than that I can't see any meaning. ;-)|`|YTasscmKaa	Deb, this is going to sound like Hallmark card crap, but its true. Life has whatever meaning that you give to it. You're still very young, there is still plenty of time to figure things out. At 21, you should be confused. Its normal. I spent alot of my life alone and I was happy. I'm happier now that I'm married and have the love of my life to share life with me. But one can be happy alone. So be alone, but be open to what may come along in your life. Finish college, get away from Mom and have some fun. Don't worry about whats going to happen ten years down the road or even one year. Once you're out of school take some time for yourself and live in the moment.|`|Uj9cLwbpaa	Go ahead and finish your degree, you need a job while you figure out what you really want to do. And you need to get away from your mother! Move out, get your own place.    Find a good psychotherapist. Therapy helped me enormously.     You will find what you really want to do. Listen to your own feelings, you will gravitate toward your path.|`|3fPm0eeOaa	*sighs*    Here's the list:    What is your meaning of life?       Life is a challenge Meet it    Life is a gift Accept it    Life is an adventure Dare it    Life is a sorrow Face it    Life is a duty Perform it    Life is a mystery Unfold it    Life is a game Play it    Life is a song Sing it    Life is an opportunity Take it    Life is a journey Complete it    Life is a promise Fulfill it    Life is a love Cherish it    Life is a beauty Praise it    Life is a spirit Realize it    Life is a struggle Fight it    Life is a puzzle Solve it    Life is a goal Achieve it.

OM71kA5Faa	Great questions and mentality you are sharing here.  I am glad to contribute my 2 cents worth.  First of all, your feelings for vengeance are normal considering how much of an @sshole this guy has been.  He offended you consciously repeatedly.  But, you have touched on the essence of your dliemma.  "I've heard it said that acting out of hatred and a desire for revenge is generally destructive to both you and the person you hate."  There is not doubt this is true and you are wise to seek a higher road than violence.  Possibly what is needed here is for you to cut him off in your heart.  Snip the strings and memories of attachment with the confidence that karma will play its part.  Your hatred towards him could also be what is inhibiting or delaying karma.  Although, surely there is not time limit or schedule for karma.      Forget about him and know that life will take care of him.  All things pass with time.|`|7ZqSiZqUaa	If you bring yourself down to his level are you any better than he is?  At least you might give him the credit of being stupid, but you'd be doing it on purpose.    Nemesis appears in her own time; she cannot be commanded.    while you still feel this way, you're letting him win.  rise above him, where you belong.    I suppose, if it really comes down to it, to wish to destory someone is human nature - but there's a great difference between wishing to do it and actually doing it.|`|6QheioCMaa	It's not  wrong to feel like doing this, but it is wrong if you do it.   that's why Jesus said, "Be angry, but don't sin".    17) Never pay back evil for evil to anyone. Respect what is right in the sight of all men.  18)  If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men.   19)  Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written, VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY, says the Lord.   20)  BUT IF YOUR ENEMY IS HUNGRY, FEED HIM, AND IF HE IS THIRSTY, GIVE HIM A DRINK; FOR IN SO DOING YOU WILL HEAP BURNING COALS ON HIS HEAD.   21)  Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good".    -Romans 12:17-21?|`|Fm5YsQnfaa	He is still destroying you because you are still mad at him.    You have to let it go. Pick yourself up dust your self down and get on with life. Treat the experience as a learning curve.    Hatred is like a cancer, it slowly destroys.    Didn't some one once say you can fool some people some of the time but you can not fool every one all the time?|`|H7L66ynJaa	It is wrong. Jesus said pray for your enemies that way you heap burning coals upon their head.|`|TnquzeM5aa	F--k drama.    People suck, and therefore are not worth being around. The sooner you accept that, the sooner you can move on.|`|UDXp2d8Zaa	You can desire to destroy him as much as you want but don't lay your hands on him and you will be fine. BTW, Jesus says that you should put away your anger.|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	Sweetie, if those people he talked trash about you to were really your friends, they'd still be their with you.  Just be glad you got rid of the excess baggage of those people so you now have plenty of time for some real friends.  Read  'The Count of Monte Cristo', it's all about revenge and the price you pay for it.|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	It happened to me and I just let it go. Then time came when we cross path and openly I hinted to him I am willing to forgive and I already did yet I also hinted that I will never forget so we have to stay away from each other.never having anything to do with one another.  I got lucky because now I am here in a country where he will never see me again hopefully.|`|R5MXZ9FFaa	No. The god of the bible destroyed millions of people, most often out of fits of jealousy and rage.    If you follow the bible god's example, you can act out your rage and violent impulses, and mindlessly hurt as many people as you'd like until your anger is finally satisfied.      Or, if you follow your own (innate) human compassion for others, take some time to relax and think about it.  A bit of sleep would likely help as well.|`|kFpFU97zaa	Start fresh.|`|PKULDaC7aa	Don't fight him, just damage a lot of his property without him knowing its you.

Prosecute him for what you can prove in a court of law.  The rest you should chalk up to experience.  Don't go out of your way to criticize him unless it comes up on its own, and then only tell the truth in a calm voice.  As for your friends not believing you--accept that some of your friends aren't going to be able to recognize the truth when they hear it.  As John Milton put it, "For neither man nor angel can discern hypocrisy, the only evil that walks invisible, except to God alone."|`|6282cae4780c315a4a883ed371640c65aa	HELLO & GOD BLESS:      What do you do when people mistreat you or those you love?Does the fire of anger boil within you.with leaping flames consuming your emotions?or do you reach somewhere to some source of cool water and pull out a bucket of mercy-to free yourself? Is there any emotion that imprisons the soul more than the unwillingness to forgive?  Don't get on the roller coaster of resentment and anger.You be the one who says "Yes ,he mistreated me ,but I am going to be like christ.I'll be the one who says ,Forgive them father ,they don't know what they're doing." The first step towards forgiveness is to see the other person as a human being,not as a source of hurt.That's how God treated us with mercy-he became one of us he felt as we feel .he understood our frustrations .And asa result ,when he hung on the cross he could look at those crucifying him and ask God to forgive them.When you forgive someone .you are as close to God as you will ever be because in that forgiveness you are demonstrating the very heart of God .It will keep you from allowing a root of bitterness to take hold.  Troubles and conflicts sometimes cause us to make accommodations we normally would find unacceptable.       Jesus said that out of the nature of the heart a man speaks .There's nothing like a good thump to reveal the nature of a heart.The character of a person is seen not in momentary heroics .but in the thump packed humdrum of day to day living.     be well be safe god bless sister rose|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	I have bad news: It's not him you're ultimately angry about, it's your "friends."    The fact is, if any of these people that your former roommate turned against you were REALLY your friend, then they would not have turned away from you.  What does this mean?  There was never true friendship there to begin with, just casual association gone uninterrupted by convenience.    I had this happen.  I reached a point in my early twenties in which I realized that 95% of the people I knew were NOT my friends whatsoever.  It was jarring to realize.    You need to understand what it means to be a friend, how to be one to someone and how to tell if you're not getting that back.  Friendship is a big-time two-way street and it's a critical thing in life.  You need to understand what that's all about and then get out there and start forming some solid friendships with a true foundation, an unshakable basis.    Bottom line, brother - this former roommate of yours did you a BIG FAT FAVOR by clearing your path for something real to come.    Now the real question of the day is whether God brought you this fine roommate of yours to blow out all the chaff so you could proceed on to engage in a REAL way...  I'd pray on that one a bit if I were you.    God bless you, I'm sorry this has caused you distress.|`|74lYDU79aa	kill dat mutha.|`|wS3oR0U7aa	What you need to do is bide your time, don't do anything rash, and devise a plan to expose him for what he is and leave him friendless and humiliated.

Over time, your feelings of rage will subside and you will be able to think more clearly.  All in all, just keep him as far from you as possible.  Also, If these other friends of yours left you behind to begin with, they obviously were not true friends and definitely not worth your time or energy.

Why do we crave knowledge?<br>  So we can allow are minds to grow, allow our species to progress for the better, it allows us to be logical and rational. it limits ignorance<br>  <br>  12. What's the meaning of life?<br>  Life should be cherished. Life is not a waiting game; it has a purpose; and that purpose is to simply live it. Not just to simply live it; but to live it to the fullest. Atheists have a great sentiment for life; while many religions people marly see it as a tedious waiting game until he supposedly get to heaven.<br>  <br>  13 Where do emotions come from<br>  An emotion is a mental and physiological state associated with a wide variety of feelings, thoughts, and behavior. William James,in the article 'What is an Emotion?' , argued that emotional experience is largely due to the experience of bodily changes<br>  <br>  14.

Evolution can't be blamed for all the suffering in the world; humans need to start taking responsibility for that as individuals. To answer some of your questions precisely, with my own opinions and evidenced facts where I can:<br>  <br>  1)Humans are not all intolerant of each other, but the ones that are seem to cling to a tribal mentality embedded in the human subconscious which, in the past, helped primitive communities be wary of outsiders.<br>  <br>  2)There is no single root cause of evil, and no totally evil people for that matter. Some people believe in committing actions that you or I would find abhorrent for what they see as the 'greater good', and these actions are then perceived as evil<br>  <br>  3)We crave knowledge because knowledge helps both individuals and humanity as a whole to operate with more wisdom, and to operate more efficiently, which increases the chance of survival and procreation of the species, which is the goal of evolution.<br>  <br>  4)There is no meaning to life, or purpose of being here, it is all an accident, like mould growing on a shower-head. After all, why does there need to be a meaning to life? Either that or our species has not yet evolved to a form that can comprehend the full and true nature of the universe and how and why it was 'created', if it was.<br>  <br>  5)Emotions are neurochemical responses to external stimuli. If something is endangering your survival, for instance, the 'fight or flight' response kicks in, which creates fear and anxiety, which in turn allows heightened sensual perception, faster reactions and increased strength which, combined with the enormous will to escape the danger that the emotion brings, will assist the person in a crisis, increasing their chances of survival. Also, 'love' as an emotion is a response to a person finding someone else who their subconcious mind is telling them would be a good mate and is ideal for them to reproduce with. Hence a lover will want to protect and care for their mate, to insure that they and their subsequent offspring survive.<br>  <br>  I could go on but I have other things to do.

xmnlLubzaa	Yes, animals (other than humans) do go to heaven automatically- Now you can debate whether this is animal heaven or human heaven!      P.S.- For all those who say that animals do not possess souls, I would like to say that anything with a brain that can think for itself somewhat (cow thinking whether she'll eat grass or go follow other cow) has a soul-- A brain without a soul is a machine without circuitry.  As for them killing other animals, that's the way God "programmed" them to be- He did NOT, however, "program" humans to kill other humans...unless absolutely necessary, that is.|`|JCGtfNeTaa	This is based upon the false premise that we have souls. You must first understand what a soul is.    According to the Bible, we do not HAVE souls; we ARE souls.    Consider the creation of mankind:    Genesis 2:7  And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.    Notice that man was not *given* a soul, but that he *BECAME* a living soul.    A soul, according to the Bible, is a body with the Breath of Life in it.      The Bible even calls animals souls.    Revelation 16:3  And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.      The Bible says that in death itself, mankind has no advantage over animals:    Ecclesiastes 3:18-21  I said in my heart, Concerning the condition of the sons of men, God tests them, that they may see that they themselves are like animals. For what happens to the sons of men also happens to animals; one thing befalls them: as one dies, so dies the other. Surely, they all have one breath; man has no advantage over animals, for all is vanity. All go to one place: all are from the dust, and all return to dust. Who knows the spirit of the sons of men, which goes upward, and the spirit of the animal, which goes down to the earth?    God did not give us souls, but we ARE SOULS.    Furthermore, souls are not immortal. For it is written:    Ezekiel 18:4 - the soul that sinneth, it shall die.    Only God is immortal:    1 Timothy 6:15-16  He who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords, 16 who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see, to whom be honor and everlasting power.      We are not immortal, as many may claim, but we will receive immortality at Christ's second coming. If we are already immortal, then we would not need to receive immortality at the second coming; but the fact is, we are NOT immortal.    1 Corinthians 15:51-54  Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality    All who die wait for one of the resurrections; either the resurrection of the just, or the resurrection of the wicked. You want to be part of the first resurrection.    People do not go to heaven (or hell) upon death; rather we wait for God's return, and *that* is when we will receive our reward or punishment.|`|FCEw1jP9aa	Animals don't have souls, so they don't go to Heaven or Hell.|`|SGSl5yeAaa	Animals don't have souls, so no they don't go to heaven.

OOPS.!!|`|W1XZ4kAVaa	no you have to have a soul and animals don't have souls so we have know idea|`|AA11008046	There is nothing in the bible to verify that animals go to Heaven.  However, thinking of it, animals do not commit the crimes of humans and they were not given a mind and free will like we humans were.  Most animals just do their thing; bother noone; graze lazily and enjoy.  No arguing over who is right and who is wrong.  One doesn't teach Bible and the other devil worship and on and on it goes.  So if I were God I probably would have a special place in Heaven for the animals they are more loving than humans too.  My Sheltie was sweeter, nicer, more friendly than my neighbors.  What ya think?  God made Man to have rule over the animals so I doubt he favors them over us.  Bible says: "..we are made just a little lower than the angels.  that is a lot higher than the animals.|`|JXfGHsF6aa	It can't be earned after a person dies, it would have to be before they die, if they could work for it.

Here is the scientific proof. The animal is eating, you are eating; the animal is sleeping, you are sleeping; the animal is defending, you are defending; the animal is having sex, you are having sex; the animals have children, you have children; you have a living place, they have a living place. If the animals body is cut, there is blood; if your body is cut, there is blood. So all these similarities are there. Now why do you deny this one similarity, the presence of the soul? That is not logical. You have studied logic? In logic there is something called analogy. Analogy means drawing a conclusion by finding many points of similarity. If there are so many points of similarity between human beings and animals, why deny one similarity? That is not logic. That is not science.|`|RrJSf2FZaa	no, animals are not allowed in heaven.  not our heaven...  it would just be too complicated - tigers wouldn't be happy if they couldn't hunt and kill, and furry small plant-eaters wouldn't be happy if they were eaten by tigers, the angels wouldn't be happy with rabbits nibbling their gardens.  Maybe we won't even be able to garden?  All you can really count on is your own mansion and streets of gold.

It is important that whenever we commit a sin, that we rush to ask Allaah's forgiveness. The scholars of Islam have mentioned that a Muslim must fulfill three conditions to have their sin forgiven by the permission of Allaah:    1) The Muslim must stop the sin  2) The Muslim must feel remorse/bad/sorry about the sin  3) The Muslim should have a strong resolve not to return to that sin again    4) There is a fourth condition if the sin involved taking the right of another person. If this is the case, then the right of that oppressed person must be returned. (For example, if someone stole money from another person, that money must be returned).    And if it happens for whatever reason or weakness that a person returns to that sin again, they should not despair of Allaah's Mercy. Rather, go through the three conditions again and work on yourself harder to not return to the sin or to actions that lead up to committing that sin.    From the Qur'aan, Allaah says, (translation of the meaning):    "Say: "O My servants who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.     And turn in repentance and in obedience with true Faith (Islamic Monotheism) to your Lord and submit to Him (in Islam) before the torment comes upon you, (and) then you will not be helped.     And follow the best of that which is sent down to you from your Lord (i.e. this Qur'an, do what it orders you to do and keep away from what it forbids), before the torment comes on you suddenly while you perceive not!"  (Qur'aan 39:53-55)    And in hadeeth:    On the authority of Abu Dharr Al-Ghafari, from the Prophet, peace be upon him, is that among the sayings he relates from his Lord is that He (Allaah) said:     "O My servants, I have forbidden oppression for Myself and have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another.     O My servants, all of you are astray except for those whom I have guided, so seek guidance of Me and I shall guide you.     O My servants, all of you are hungry except for those whom I have fed, so seek food of Me and I shall feed you.     O My servants, all of you are naked except for those whom I have   clothed, so seek clothing of Me and I shall clothe you.     O My servants, you sin by night and by day, and I forgive all sins, so seek forgiveness of Me and I shall forgive you.     O My servants, you will not attain harming Me so as to harm Me, and you will not attain benefiting Me so as to benefit Me.     O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to become as pious as the most pious heart of any one man of you, that would not increase My kingdom in anything.     O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as wicked as the most wicked heart of any one man of you, that would not decrease My kingdom in anything.     O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to rise up in one place and make a request of Me, and were I to give everyone what he requested, that would not decrease what I have, any more than a needle decreases the sea if put into it.     O My servants, it is but your deeds that I reckon up for you and then recompense you for, so let him who finds good praise Allah, and let him who finds other than that blame no one but himself."

08H81poqaa	Start with the "self" and face the insecurities head on.  You cannot worry about what people think of you.  We each are own a journey to find our place in the sun.      When we look inside and recognize the child who carrries all the insecurities and emotions, we learn to face these without blaming others.  Admitting to our own faults and not fearing what others think.      When these become realized, amazing revelations begin to occur and the self begins to awaken to the reality of the self.  A joy begins to replace the fear, self-doubt, anxiety and so on.  Do these ever leave? probably not because we are many in one.    This process leads to alchemy.  A refining of the spirit to an enlightened being.    Your new "rebirth" will bring messages to others who are in need of hearing the language of Love or the Divineness.

tlUihEOvaa	Don't let these people get to you... There is no point in trying to educate some of them, hey some of these people may never change or mature.     I know why you are mad, yes I saw the question about "Asian body". They say I have a small wee wee so what? They say all Asian girls are skinny and flat, so what the girls in my family aren't.     What I'm saying is that these people judge and call it reality but they haven't seen the whole reality. Basically they are living in their little world. Well for some they are just jealous and insecure, yeah I know this is said many times but it is true.    We all come in different shapes and sizes but I guess some people want to be "race scientists" who say that my claim is pc. No it's not being pc, it is evident that we all are shaped differently.

Most our early population was from Asian born decent and all have assimilated into Australian culture, same with people born of African decent and people from all over the globe descents.    We all don't hyphen country or segregate ourselves into groups, all of our cultures have combined, which has made Australia's very unique culture.     None of us look at each other differently or label or stereotype each other as were all Australians. We all were educated the same, watched the same stuff on TV and we all have the same accent, have the same equal rights and freedoms without discrimination and pride ourselves on mateship and looking out for fellow Australians.       The only time we ever hear or see, typical American toilet humored stereotyping and segregated labeling is only on American television shows or films, not within our society.     Occasionally there are a few young jerks who are influenced by US toilet humor stereotyping who shoot there mouths off.  Only we don't get offended we all laugh at them because they too are from foreign decent.     With our anti discrimination laws, if a person repeatedly or publicizes or uses discrimination towards another person or member of the public, due to their, color, race, sexual orientation, gender, age, disability, beliefs or non beliefs, to harass or publicly discriminate at work, school, home, etc, etc.     You can report them to the police and the anti discrimination tribunal.|`|EJJ3OBPJaa	stereotypes are given to children from their parents.we get them from what they tell us or what we hear on tv or what we read.I'm not a racist because my parents taught me not to be.I hate racists because my parents taught me to.and I'm glad about it.I think they did well.but not every parents are like mine.there are many of them who learn their kids to think like racists to feel like racists...it's sad...|`|hsW3IvqSaa	i believe in classifying people by their style: prep, emo, goth, jock whatever    but i dont assume that all emos cut themselves, or that all preps are self-centered, or that all jocks want to screw a cheerleader after the game. i just classify people

VyZkbi8Daa	At my school your aloud...  The only thing you can't alter IS THE UNIFORM  there shouldn't be a rule saying you can't wear a certain shoe.  I wore stuff besides normal shoes =P anyways|`|A1PLJKhUaa	We have a very strict uniform. Black shoes (usually Dubarrys http://www.maidenchandlery.co.uk/images/... , black pumps or flats are acceptable but no heels or trainers), navy knee-high socks, navy pinafore, white shirt and royal blue jumper...the tie is the only optional thing, but the rest is very strict, we can add a few badges (very few) and roll up our sleeves, but that's it...we're not allowed to wear nose studs or long earrings. It's pretty strict, but I don't really mind it that much.|`|oJ9NpqALaa	when you have a uniform you cant add things to it.  its a UNIFORM  the whole point is so that they all look the same  its not a big deal anyway. i had a uniform for 5 years and i didn't care  why would you want to wear heels at school anyway? you'd look stupid|`|s8Cbg73baa	You can normally wear heels at a school with dress codes. Get wild and crazy but cute jewelry and cool shoes. get creative with your hair and expirement with belts. It really isn't as bad as you think. =D|`|bRoFUcIgaa	We don't have a dress code, we're basically aloud to wear anything *within reason*. If you're exposing too much cleavage (girls) or your wearing an extremely skimpy top, you'll be asked to put a sweater on but that's rare. Oh and you'll be asked to turn your t-shirt in side out with it has a rude/offensive message on it and spikey belts/bracelets aren't aloud as they can "be used as a weapon". LOL!  Usually when you have a uniform I'd say that you can accessorize, if you don't go overboard and if the accessories aren't distracting. A cute headband, maybe a couple layered necklaces- but it really depends on your school and how strict it is so I can't honestly tell you the answer.  If they don't provide you with shoes and it says nothing about footwear, then high heels should be fine... just make sure they aren't too flashy or whatever. I couldn't deal with a uniform either, I personally like being able to express myself through clothing and I'd prefer not to be a clone. I love fashion/etc... I wouldn't be able to go to a school w/ a uniform!!!
1EhbLBkUaa	1 Is correct.  2 is very, very awkward and broken.  <br>  <br>  The usual pattern (not always, but usual) for an English sentence is to have the subject first, which in this case is the portrait.  #1 starts with the subject of the portrait, so it is immediately clear.  #2 starts with a somewhat dangling participle -- it's not so clear what the phrase "on that wall" applies to, which leaves it "dangling" -- and then the meat of the sentence starts with the verb, which is generally doesn't happen in English.|`|p3NW0Mstaa	The portrait on the wall, who is the singer?|`|f106f574855f6526410e30fbb7976b07aa	I could dazzle you with detail about the natural and normal order of nouns, verbs, prepositions and parenthetical phrases and demonstrate how number one is better and none of that means nearly so much as the fact that although the second sentence is technically correct it confused me and I needed to read it twice.

lfnjwpu1aa	That is your day to shine and go after someone you really would like to spend some time with, dress up for a school dance could be the Lil 'Abner theme, and a DJ,  If held during the winter months, the Sadie Hawkins dance may be called the Snow Ball or some other wintry name. In a variation on pure Sadie Hawkins custom, a particular song may be designated a snowball dance by the disc jockey or master of ceremonies.    In that case, also known as "speed dancing" (because of its similarities to speed dating), the DJ picks two people to start dancing, usually to a slow dance. Periodically the DJ will shout, "snowball," signaling that the dancers must find new partners, thus increasing the number of partners on the floor. Half of the people asking new dancers to come to the floor will be girls asking boys, Sadie Hawkins-style. By the end of the song, most all of the people at the dance are on the dance floor. The "snowball dance" is typically used to get the dancing started, as school dances can be notoriously slow to start. In some areas, people chosen to dance cannot refuse, thereby ensuring people get onto the dance floor, and thus the "snowball" gains momentum and grows. It is a lot of fun and gets everyone involved. If the girl asks the guy has to dance...Thank you
QIQNzE11aa	I'd be slightly annoyed and then try to find the funny in it while cleaning it up. I once had a kid set off a pop-bottle bomb prank at our house. It was harmless but made a loud noise. All the kids on the football team got it that night. The neighbors called the police and our police has so little work that they finger printed the darned thing and arrested the two who did it. But that is FAR from normal! In the state i was born at they didn't even finger print my brothers car when it was broken into and had the stereo equipment stolen.     Pranks stink and you can warn the police it's happening in the neighborhood so they can keep an eye out. Maybe catch the pranksters. At least they aren't really being destructive. But is best if they see more police keeping a look out as it might deter them from becoming destructive.|`|REC4YgOuaa	call the police and file report|`|VMY7No0eaa	Just ignore it... if you act like it bothers you ...you give them what they want...a reaction|`|dST3XrkNaa	Complaint in police.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	You call the police.

But it will be a low priority. If this progresses to vandalism then it will become a higher priority.    One of those movement-triggered floodlights outside your house might help deter them.

He replaced them with two.  To love Jehovah with all your heart, soul and mind and to love your neighbor as yourself.  He did fulfill the law.  That was his purpose.  Once fulfilled it was done.  Jesus condemns gays and lesbians.  It has nothing to do with the Mosaic laws anymore.  Homosexuality is mentioned right along with murder, fornication, adultery.  I personally don't care what they do but why advertise it?  Would someone go around advertising that they were a murderer or a adulterer?  I don't think so. People who do wrong always try to justify their actions.  <br>  <br>  Matthew 22:(Matthew 22:36-40) .?.?.” 37?He said to him: “‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.’ 38?This is the greatest and first commandment. 39?The second, like it, is this, ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’ 40?On these two commandments the whole Law hangs, and the Prophets.”<br>  <br>  <br>  Gal. 10?For all those who depend upon works of law are under a curse; for it is written: “Cursed is every one that does not continue in all the things written in the scroll of the Law in order to do them.” 11?Moreover, that by law no one is declared righteous with God is evident, because “the righteous one will live by reason of faith.” 12?Now the Law does not adhere to faith, but “he that does them shall live by means of them.” 13?Christ by purchase released us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse instead of us, because it is written: “Accursed is every man hanged upon a stake.” 14?The purpose was that the blessing of Abraham might come to be by means of Jesus Christ for the nations, that we might receive the promised spirit through our faith.<br>  <br>  Romans 10:4?For Christ is the end of the Law, so that everyone exercising faith may have righteousness.<br>  <br>  1 Corn. 6:9?What! Do YOU not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit God’s kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men, 10?nor thieves, nor greedy persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit God’s kingdom.|`|AA11849917	The Jewish Law is applicable only to Jews still living under the Law.<br>  <br>  The moral law is applicable to every one.<br>  <br>  The New Testament condemns homosexuals just as much as the Old Testament, meaning that it transcends Jewish Law, and so it falls into the category of moral law that is applicable to all people.<br>  <br>  As far as food, "But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood."  (Act 15:20 KJV) and "For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well."  (Act 15:28-29 KJV) and finally, "As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication."

Things happen because something causes them - maybe billions and billions of circumstances in the distant path, and then hundreds things in the near past.    However, most people create a narrative (a story, a reason) for something bad that happened as a method of resolving the pain, or handling the tragedy.  This is the best way - in terms of mental health and being part of a society.  (Criminals don't do this - they blame others.)    There are people who don't have the sophistication or clear thinking abilities to create that narrative    A non-criminal who doesn't think clearly might say, Instead,  "Everything happens for a reason," "this is a sign," or "God works in mysterious ways."    Another way to look at it.  When something bad happens - a lightning strike or slamming your finger in a door - you have an infinite number of ways of explaining why it happened, or for integrating the tragedy into your life.    "God hates me," is one fiction.  "Everything bad happens to me," is another fiction.  "Everything happens for a reason," is another fiction.  "I'm so embarrassed that I messed up," is another fiction.  "God works in mysterious ways," is another fiction.    More realistic, truthful, in line with how an average or smart person would handle pain or tragedy:    "I made a mistake - what can i do better next time."  "Why did I make the mistakes that put me in this situation where I was likely to be hurt?"  "Ow, that hurts.  But, that is a risk that I am willing to take."  "Let me see if I can design a door that doesn't hurt fingers."  "This is a serious set back.  What can I do to either change my life's path, or get back on my previous life path."|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	Yeah, I wonder how we (the modern humans) are less deserving of a biblical holocaust than those ancient people were.  Perhaps because God loves watching LOST and he doesn't want to flood us or destroy us because he may never figure out all the mysteries.    Thus God works in mysterious ways because man makes mysterious TV shows.|`|D1BNSf5uaa	Well, Losasha is definitely no Friedrich Nietzsche. :)

He's probably very low on himself and in actuality nobody probably really likes him. If he thinks bothering a girl is fun, that shows you what kind of person he really is, which is very very ugly. Don't let his words get to you, as long as you know that you're not what he's calling you, just try pay no mind to him.   If you need to talk to somebody about it, let somebody at your school know, like a teacher you trust or your principal or something. They'll hopefully get you help as fast as they can.

If the man lost his job and was truly making every effort to find another job or was at least going to school to get a better job, or if he legitimately couldn't work for reasons such as a recognized disability, then yes, I'd stick by him.    but if the guy was perfectly capable of working but was just an emotionally abusive and lazy good-for-nothing jerk who wouldn't even try to look for a job and always seemed to have an excuse as to why he couldn't work or go back to school and expected to live off me, then yeah, I'd drop em like bad habit!

LJznhiLEaa	I don't have a lot of time, and this is a REALLY GOOD QUESTION!  But I'll do what I can for now and you can email me if you want and we can discuss it further.    Jesus established the church upon Peter's confession "you are the Christ, the Son of the Living God!"  All who make such a confession are a part of "The Church" - universal, throughout history, beyond denominational expression and type.    So it's been said that when a group of people who are Christians (people who have made this confession) gathers, it's church.  That's partly right.    But church is much more.  It's Christian community, which we need.  We need one another, we need to be in one anothers' lives, we need to 'do life together'.  Gathering on a Sunday is a starting place.    Church is also the gathering that includes 'elders', who we are commanded to submit to.  If you have no church, which Elders do you submit to?  Whichever you choose?  If so, is that really submission?  "I'll submit to you as long as I choose to..." doesn't sound like submission.    Church is also where the sacraments (or ordinances) are administered - baptism and communion.  The two things Jesus told us to do as Christians are to be done in a church context.  No church = no opportunity to be involved in baptism or communion = no opportunity to obey Jesus.    So what about online church?  I'm a fan - BUT I would suggest that those who START OUT online should FIND A PHYSICAL SPACE/group of people to belong with.    I know time constraints (I'm pushing it right now), but you make priorities with your time all day.  The question is, is church a priority?|`|Oc5UTGDSaa	If its spirituality rather then religion that you seek, try http://www.kab.tv/eng/ there are tons of virtual lessons.|`|JCGtfNeTaa	I found a great place to learn more about God, and some free wonderful Bible studies on all sorts of topics. You and your family can do these studies at your own pace, all online. If you prefer, I believe that you can have them mail them to you instead.    And after completing the series of studies, they send by mail a nice certificate. That is pretty cool!    I personally enjoyed these studies, and learned a lot, and so have many others that have been referred there.    You can find these free online Bible studies at:    http://www.amazingfacts.org/FreeStuff/Bi...    Also available on that website are audio (and I think some video) files about various topics, such as Bible Answers, a radio talk show where people call in with their Bible questions.    It's a great place to learn more about God!!|`|LFi7Wkteaa	It's always great to fellowship with brothers and sisters!... but just be careful. ;)   http://online-churches.net/    _____________________________________    This is to reply CJ... he should've read this verse carefully.    believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross and rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4).    Praying that prayer WILL NOT give you eternal life. IT IS BY FAITH ALONE IN GOD... IN HIS GRACE.

Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross and rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|3YXTUYS7aa	yes. you could also go to a real church with one of your friends( if they go to a church) or maybe a local youth group.|`|g5FbtzNTaa	Contact me and I'll steer you in the right direction.

QWMPWia4aa	It sounds to me like he's flirting or atleast interested in you as more than mere friends.  That's a lot of physical contact for just a buddy...  Any one of those things, even two, could be perfectly platonic in intent but all of them together tells me he wants something and maybe doesn't even know what it is himself.    I used to be the same way with my high school buddy I had a crush on, wanting to be close to him, touching him any way I can, craving physical contact with him while trying to make it seem as innocent as possible.  I think I might have pushed it a little too far cause he ended our friendship and told me I gave him "weird vibes."  It was pretty painful, actually.    Since you're gay yourself, you can be more sensitive to his feelings if he is actually secretly flirting with you.  For now, just keep on doing what you're doing as see what happens.  Be kind, open, accepting and just generally a good friend to him and if/when he's ready to take the first step out of the closet he will and you'll be there to welcome him.  I take it he knows you're gay.  That's probably why he's comfortable doing these things with you.    It's possible he's crushing on you too.  If that's the case, are you interested in pursuing anything with him?  If not, be very careful to let him down lightly.  He'll be very vulnerable.  That's about all I can tell you from the information I have...|`|CN4QDGbwaa	i deffinatly think he is flirting.  he might be exploring his options in life.. i think when he is ready he will tell you.|`|W545hqrpaa	Go with the flow.|`|YLM9nkq0aa	Maybe you should try and up the flrtaciousnous with him. See how he responds and act on it.|`|1hS27eJuaa	he could be flirting or he could just be a friend, I say ask him if he would kiss you or kiss him.|`|rDFnsFf2aa	i definably think he is flirting|`|FoCq94cTaa	HE WANTS IT, but is affraid.|`|89sPanC8aa	My friend does the same thing he even plays with my hand absent mindedly and we always sleep in the same bed when at camp outs and sleepovers, but I'm sure he's not gay (he's very physical with his girlfriend). Some guys just have a very physical love language and are not afraid of showing it to male and female friends. I would guess he only likes you as a friend but try testing out how he feels about homosexuality, he could be bisexual but don't count on it.|`|1kfKiw1Jaa	He's definitely flirting with you.|`|d940b613c72e65dceb131f078c7f061eaa	It could just be his style of affection.  If he's very comfortable with himself, he might even be more physically affectionate with you than with other friends as a form of being reassuring if he thinks you might be having a tough time of your own life (not terribly likely, but possible).    He could be flirting at a glacial exploratory pace.    A possibility that hasn't been mentioned yet is that he's flirting without really wanting a relationship or even an encounter.  I've come across two types of people of this sort.  The more innocent type might be summed up as having a small bisexual stripe.  There's some small emotional need, not large enough to accommodate a romance, that gets met through this sort of interaction.  It's more commonly gay men flirting with women.  The less amiable type enjoys sending out confusing signals, though often unconsciously.  It's a variation on the seducer theme, only this sort of seducer doesn't really want to sleep with his prey.  The ultimate satisfaction comes from the moment of supreme power when the gay friend finally makes the first move, and is virtuously rebuffed.  There is a lot of dramatic potential in that scene for anyone with more than the usual quantity of Inner Ham.    I don't really think your friend is that last type, but it is a possibility.  Good luck, and I hope you remain close friends whatever the outcome.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	Sounds like he is flirting and is maybe just curious however because he is your good friend don't risk the friendship by starting anything physical with him.

FyHaU0D6aa	A fusional (or inflecting) language is a language in which words can be changed in their basic form to denote grammatical, syntactic, semantic, etc., change. This change often happens on a level where its clear that the original word and the resulting words are related, but the difference between the two is more than just building blocks put together, so to speak.    An agglutinative language, on the other hand, is a language in which such things are expressed through a more or less straightforward glueing on of an affix, without much effect on the root word.    To confuse matters, no language is completely agglutinative or completely fusional. Most non-analytic languages (and even some analytic languages) display both agglutinative and fusional behaviour. In English, derivation is most commonly (though not always) agglutinative, whereas conjugation and declension is more often fusional.    For example, consider the verb to do. In the third person singular of the present tense, it becomes (he/she/it) does, where the pronunciation is changed from [du:] to [d?z/d?z]. The marker -s [z] is a double marker: it marks both present tense and third person singular, which is a fusional characteristic (fusing different functions together into one affix); moreover, the fact that the vowel changes is very markedly fusional, since the root and the affix tend up yielding more than the logical sum of their constituents. Logically, [du:] + [z] would yield [du:z], but it doesnt.    The same is visible in the past tense, did: [d] is the formulaic way of showing past tense in English, but [du:] + [d] should yield [du:d], not [d?d].      Conversely, changing a noun to and adjective or vice versa is very often an agglutinative process, where the addition of an affix is a mere copy-paste action. Take the adjective strange, for example. To turn it into a noun, a simple nominalising suffix -ness is added: strangeness. The pronunciation is predictable, the root and the affix do not fuse in any way, and the affix has only one meaning: nominalising. Its simply pasted straight on to the existing word, and it can be pasted on to many other adjectives to form nouns in exactly the same way: oddness, coolness, rightness, sureness, etc.      What we call agglutinative languages are simply languages where the latter of these types of word formation is by far the most common, and the former is not so commonly used.    Finnish, for example, is considered mostly an agglutinative language (though it has many fusional elements, too), since even conjugation and declension is most agglutinative. Consider the example taloissanikinko?, which means, also in my houses?. This is very simply broken down into smaller units: talo-i-ssa-ni-kin-ko [house-plural-in-my-also-question]. Nothing changes or fuses together with anything else, everything is just stacked on at the end.      This was probably rather long, but I hope it helps to clear up the distinction, and the fact that the agglutinative/fusional question is not one of either/or, but rather one of a scale of agglutinativeness and fusionalness. :)|`|AA10948829	Yeah, it's kind of hard to understand.    Agglutinating and fusional languages both have words formed by morphemes. The only difference is, with agglutinating, you can tell where one morpheme begins and ends while, with fusional, you can't. This is because while agglutinating morphemes have ONE meaning for ONE morpheme, fusional means there are MANY meanings in ONE morpheme.

2SSD6BP9aa	Whether you know it or not, the worst is over now that your dad knows.  I know you're also worried about what everyone at school thinks about you, but that really doesn't matter as much.    You could start by telling 1 or 2 really close friends and see how they take it, before telling more people.  But also realize that once you tell everyone else, there is no way to be sure it won't spread around.  Even if they are a good friend and accept you completely they may still mess up and let it slip to someone else.|`|IPA76Oq2aa	only tell people you trust....talk to your bestfreind first thn tell him/her to tell everyone else that won't bully you about it|`|25VLfLH2aa	once u have ur parents support. thats all u need..  next should be ur close friends.. :]  theyll understand.. trust me..  and then itll be easier for u to not care  what anyone else thinks :]|`|CmVlLsbZaa	Tell the people who matter the most to you.  It's important they know who you are because it defines you, and it will help them understand who you are.      You took the right steps already: accepted it yourself and now your dad accepts it.  Continue with the slow pace. Like anything else personal, you don't want to self-disclose to quicly about who you are, you have to keep some things secret to some people, and disclose more to others.      Good luck and don't be afraid to be who you are :)|`|H41u0B8Jaa	That is good your dad is understanding.  I think given your age you should probably not tell people yet because people in your age group can be very cruel.  Give it a couple of years and then you can come out to the people you feel close to.  You have nothing to be ashamed about however you can save yourself a lot of teasing and name calling by keeping this to yourself for a while longer.|`|vJqPsEsWaa	Yes, I agree that this is where you find out who likes you for you & who doesn't. I would start with close friends. By the way, pride or no pride, we live in an ignorant world, I seriously think you should consider telling anyone if you feel it might cause you any sort of harm. And at 13, you may still be experimenting or curious, so I wouldn't use a label just yet. Although I have to admit, I found out I am gay at 13 & today at 2 months till 17, I still am. By the way, I can't believe your dad's cool with it. Take care :)|`|H2IqzG12aa	This is where you find out who your really best friends are.

Go with your gut on it :)|`|TjPwxbuJaa	Wow, if you can tell your Dad I'm surprised everyone isn't much easier.

If you do, go into edit profile, then go into details, change it so the sexual orientation bit says that you are gay. By the time all your friends have seen your profile, they will all know.    But make sure that you aren't going to get beaten up or anything, I don't advise doing this if your friends are in any way homophobic.|`|2MXBaionaa	thats no prob kiddo lisen ok if u need help ill help you ok my email is joestar17@yahoo.com    and ya do what feels right ok good luck dude|`|1IJUxVBSaa	It's great that your dad is accepting. But. I think you might be too young to make it too public, you know? I was 13, almost 14 when I came out, and I think it happened too early. I regret it now kind of, but regardless it is a relief. I would say if you're ready go for it. Just tell who you trust. The mistake I made is letting everyone know and being a walking rainbow for a little while, which kind of made me forget about who I was and just made me think of my sexuality. If you're ready, tell who you trust and make sure to remain who you are afterward. I don't know if any of this helps but good luck!|`|LnrPDF5Gaa	at least you told your dad n its beyond brilliant that hes accepting of you.....So dont stress, you dont need to rush and start telling pple that your gay.     but you gota tell atleast 1friend who you can trust or wait for the right moment to tell certain pple when the time is right........|`|EK7mJWPZaa	awww.....your lucky about your dad.....dont rush.....you got time....just start by telling your closest friends....just one at a time.....im 14 and i havent told anyone yet (until next week :D) so dont be in such a hurry

"Gay" means you're attracted to members of the same sex and that you're going to form romantic relationships with the same sex.  If your family says they accept you being gay, but you can't bring your boyfriend to family functions, what they're saying is that it's OK to be gay *as long as you don't act on it or let anybody know*.    My sister and her husband would pull that on me a couple of decades ago when I was with my ex, and try to do things like invite me to dinner (without him) -- and I put my foot down and said we either go together as a group (including my partner) or I will make dinner for us at home:  their choice.

It's not in what they SAY, it is in what they DO that you will see acceptance.    The next time your family has a function, tell them that you would like to bring your partner. If that's a no-go, then say that unfortunately, you won't be able to attend. Say nothing more. They'll get the message.     They need to understand that to "accept" you is to ACCEPT you and not to merely give lip service to the issue.    Good luck.|`|AyEkA6Flaa	Is this because they are ashamed of your being gay, or is it because they don't really like your boyfriend?    If it is because they are uncomfortable with you being gay, well, they need to get over it.  You could surely bring your boyfriend along just as your best buddy, and over time people would eventually get it that he has a major place in your life.    But if it's because they don't like your boyfriend -- well, what is that about?  Is he super feminine, or isn't the right social class, or what?  If it's something that he could tone down, maybe that's an option.  But otherwise, I think they should accept him simply because you love him.    If you were married to a girl, they would have to deal with her no matter what.  Well, they should have to deal with your boyfriend also.    If they won't, maybe you should spend holidays with his family instead.  It's harsh, but they are being harsh by not welcoming the young man you love.|`|AA10953937	I got one better. My family doesn't accept gay people.  However, I went to family function and one of my past boyfriends showed up married a cousin.    I believe your family have your best interests at heart.  They know everybody is not as accepting as they are. In time, you will be able to act and do for yourself.  Perhaps then you will be allowed to bring your friend around.|`|oWj5WB7laa	tell your parents if they truly loved you they would accept your boyfriend because if they love you they want you to be happy right and if they know he makes you happy they would accept him|`|7wqIJbPjaa	say that your going to bring him as your best friend.... and then when your there be like uhh best friend? try boyfriend!! ahaha your parents might be pissed but if you wish to retaliate do it up!|`|MvmuZMG4aa	i suggest that you abide to their request of not bringing your boyfriend to functions... as a gay person, you should be the one with greater understanding... ask them nicely why you cant bring your boyfriend and tell them nicely how you feel.... remember that love is a process of give and take and a lot of compromising..|`|grYkoDaraa	it might be because they don't know how the rest of your family will react.
5oNwMqMiaa	Hi hun,<br>  What a situation, it's common and sometimes the friend suffer, which is the wrong way around!<br>  A year to be with your boyf is a long time, if you were going to cheat or go out with one of your boy mates, you would have been in a relationship with one of them by now!  A prospect I imagine is really is unthinkable to you because you are all just friends.<br>  Have you told your boyf what you wrote above, about being a tom boy and having more male mates?  Would it upset you to do so, or does he know this already and it doesn't make a difference?  I wonder why lately it's a problem?  Has something changed?<br>  Has he met your boy mates?  Maybe that would be a good idea.  <br>  My ex was paranoid abut one of my mates, Matt, who was the singer in a band.  He detested me seeing him, so came along to one of his gigs.  Something clicked and he realised even if Matt was in to me, he wasn't my type and it put his silly little mind at rest - he was a lot older so should have known better.<br>  However, it might put you guy's mind at rest if you introduce him to your guy friends, let's face it, you don't want to lose your mates or him!<br>  Good luck hun xx|`|tL5YbnWjaa	You should not have to give up your friends to be in a relationship. If you are not flirting with other guys you are doing nothing wrong. If other guys flirt with you you might want to mention that you are in a relationship; you could say "my boyfriend and I like to..." (go to movies on Saturday, shop at such and such. etc.)|`|kwe8wAyKaa	nope, that's perfectly fine but it looks like your boyfriend doesn't trust you. be careful.
216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	Yes I would be mad too.  I would request that the management reduce my rent by x number of days because of this.    nfd?|`|ocP9KdQiaa	i would try to stay calm...|`|Tc23KWgzaa	You called the offices, they haven't returned your call, but when you found the guys on the property, they were able to answer your questions immediately.  You've got to ask the right person at the right time and this time it was the guy on the job.  Be angry on Friday when no work has been done.  Don't waste your energy just yet.    TX Mom|`|AA11858035	Notifying you of the delay would have been the proper thing to do, yes, but I don't think something as insignificant as that would be worth getting all worked up over.|`|AA10064810	Of course you should be pissed off; however, this isn't as unusual as you think.  Worst yet is the person who starts the job and then has multiple problems, deaths in the family, etc. and who delays finishing.    You can contact the Condo board and find out what's up.|`|KBVAbwUXaa	well... you know what they say, it's better to be pissed off, than to be pissed on.|`|1UhFVCcIaa	I would too !|`|AA12022610	i would be too. talk to the landlord|`|xlMtgNT9aa	Yesss be mad|`|8tqQXcp4aa	Very worth getting pissed off over.

But fortunately we live in a house.. lol|`|evEYVoqMaa	no not at all|`|Au32tyxGaa	Fing Apartments!! They are all hassles!! Save up for a house!    I would be pissed too, if they don't come tomorrow, I would call like every hour asking the status.|`|LOYOcnkYaa	nah chill out|`|Iy36xZMOaa	Pissed off -- no.  Would I do something about it?  Yes.  I would call them and talk to them or leave a message.  No point getting angry -- just be assertive and take control of the situation.|`|Op32hmEtaa	yea i would be, called your landlord and ask me why, if no answer, then i guess you would have to wait
216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	Be as nice as you can.  I think it's wonderful.    nfd?|`|aJGAXYUIaa	YEs i DO|`|9oTCe1g2aa	how do you "movie"?|`|8tqQXcp4aa	Looks like you're either a very try hard person. (Sorry it could be true). Or your sense of style or ettiquette, doesn't flow well with that vibe at the school. OR those kids at your school are straight up mofo's. If you've just newly moved then It's probably the territorial issues that wacked up girl Madi is having. Sit next to a boy, no problem. But If it continues to happen. Just sit beside her, what's the worst she can do? Plus if you just sit beside her and she moves, then you're fine with out her. Don't make or be extra or be an attention hog (unesscessary comment/jokes.. that are way corny, and laugh at them by yourself..). Plus if this Madi girl pisses you off even more, just be like "If I'm bothering you then say it to my face. Two-face." Then roll your eyes. Then do that Napolean Dynamite.. "gosh"... After that she'll shut up. Btw what grade are you and Madi in? *Cuz this is only effective in grades 8 or 7.. down.

In my case if I notice a butt  is a bad thing because I like them small; if it's too big, is nasty and kind of gay.  But I have friends that like nice round butts on guys.  What most girls do like and really look at is the hip bones, when the pants are dropping a little and guys are shirtless... That's sexy|`|NiRFYhVDaa	no|`|lHzBJA4eaa	A lot of guys have zero butt so it's irrelevant to  most women I guess.But if you have a nice butt they love it.|`|bc8492ecc5cb8d9056d4595644fa6f30aa	Only if you walk a certain way.

AyEkA6Flaa	You should be able to tell if you are gay or straight *long* before you lose your virginity.    The simple question is, who do you fall in love with, crush on, yearn to hold, crave to make out with, want to snuggle naked with?    Who makes your eyes bright with excitement, your heart pound, and your breath catch when they walk up to you?    Who do you fantasize about when you masturbate?    When looking into a crowd of people, who automatically, instinctively gets your attention -- and you keep on noticing them?    Who do your lips really want to kiss?  Who do your arms really want to hold?    *****    If guys give you energy, passion and hold your romantic interest in a major way, you are gay.    If girls give you energy, passion and hold your romantic interest in a major way, you are straight.    If you want and love both girls and guys, you are bisexual, though most guys have a definite preference.    If none of this makes sense to you, perhaps you are asexual and just not a very romantic or sexual person.|`|CDft5bscaa	if you're getting aroused by both, then virgin or not, you're bi|`|k9gp11PMaa	Since u get aroused by both straight and gay porn u r bisexual.|`|Iv0JwccEaa	i think that it is very possible that u are gay. u can compare how big u are to straight porn. i find that weird that a straight man would even watch gay porn and masturbate to it. from ur comments i think u are a bi male.     if u are gay, be proud of who u are. don't come out until u are ready to deal with the consequences of it. don't be ashamed of who u are. and don't worry about what people think...im just saying to be prepared if you tell ur friends and family. some people arent comfortable with homosexuality. good luck....|`|Y9GdwvnWaa	you can still know if your gay if you are a virgin by what you are sexually attracted to! so besides porn do you look at girls or guys?|`|R8yelFG7aa	I'm bi-sexual.  I've never been with a woman.  I am however attracted to women.  The idea of being with a woman turns me on.     I have straight female friends who like to watch porn of women getting off- they learn from it, the sound and sight of another woman getting off makes them think of themself getting off.  Some of them even watch lesbian porn.  But they aren't interested in being with a woman.    Porn can be stimulating in different ways to different people.  If you get off watching men come... doesn't really mean anything.  If the idea of being with a man turns you on/gets you off, then likely you're attracted to men.      You seem to be really concerned about this so I'll say one more thing.  You don't necessarily choose who you're attracted to- biochemistry does that.  But you can choose who you have sex with.  Being bi-sexual or gay or lesbian doesn't mean you have to have sex with anyone or any one gender.        Not having had sex doesn't matter a whole lot concerning orientation so far as I see it.      *when you do decide to have sex, remember that safe sex makes life simpler for everyone.|`|d956b5a86c3910ccc374a8987ce51194aa	I say go for it with a girl first...  then think about being bi :)  good luck  cheers :D|`|r9s0VyJgaa	You don't need to lose your virginity to know if you're gay, bi, or straight.      If you're honest with yourself, you probably already know who you'd LIKE to lose your virginity to.  Watching porn doesn't count.  If you were going to go to bed with a real, living and breathing human being, who would you want it to be -- a man, or a woman?  There's your answer.|`|grYkoDaraa	i am a virgin still and i know that i am gay.
DfDss68haa	The Mind of a Hater:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXC0bQZ2z...    Unfortunately hun, black people are the worst haters of black people. Most of us are still under the brainwashing of Viacom and believe that we should be gangsters, hoods, listen to rap or R&B, watch BET and not make good grades.    Before Viacom it was the slave mentality. If a black person tried to succeed they were told to "stop acting white." I have been there sweetie. I had mostly white friends, listened to "white music" (I love classic rock stations), dressed "white", talked "white, got good grades. This was just how I was raised. You can see where this is going I'm sure, I got made fun of all day long by the other black kids. They were cruel. My mom is like your dad pretty much, she has implied that I shouldn't like rock. I do like some R&B now that I have gotten older but not when I was your age. Think about it this way, is your dad a musician? Then how can you listen to his music?     Ignore the haters. You are not a sheep. Black people (all people) hate the exceptions and those who don't conform. I promise you most of those people "acting black" aren't acting like themselves, they are acting like what they saw on TV that a black person should act like. You are the blackest person among those idiots frankly. I remember I tried everything to try to "blacken" myself. I forced myself to listen to R&B radio channels, date only black guys, and watch "black" movies and BET. I dressed in gangster clothes and tried out black slang. I tried to enjoy Kool-Aid and chitlins. I wanted to understand this culture I saw and why everyone else could like it but not me. I was ashamed. It was exhausting and the whole time I wanted to listen to Regina Spektor or some rock, date white guys, and eat some pizza. The best thing I can tell you is to just be yourself, be real. Every adolescent tries to become someone they are not at some point to fit in but you don't have to. If they ever make fun of you again, don't listen.    Read this blog:  funny intelligent black guy who blasts "black culture" and how we view ourselves:  http://stuffblackpeoplehate.com    EDIT: LOL I love how other answers prove my argument about how brainwashed some black people still are, they think black people still have to like "black" things and white people need to like "white things". Once again, don't listen sweetie. Prefering certain things and people just means that is what you relate to. It is not the same as self hatred. Talk intelligent, watch movies that look interesting to you, listen to music you like, talk to people you have fun with, succeed in life, date people you find attractive, eat tasty foods, and feel bad for the people still trying to fit into the negative sterotypes of black people created by white people. Feel sorry for them.|`|PnEzCdGzaa	im just like you im 12 and black and i only have white friends listen to rock but i just block out what the ghetto ppl say and stay with my frends because i am who i am if they dont like it then too bad.    oh and to answer your question over time all of them will change last year everybody was ghetto and act black but now some ppl are punk prep ghetto as the older u get the more they will find there personality..in middle school its were u get braces and find who u are.|`|CvSKPHiqaa	wow well you even like the country. yeh i used to be a rocker and probs ur age but i grew out of it and broadened my horizons eventually. just ignore those idiots and be yourself. you'll just make a more interesting person!|`|lnKnHh32aa	Trust be , I'm full black and I have SO been there,  I like a lot of rock bands (some that you mentioned), as well as hip hop, pop, rap, classsical guitar stuff ( I play guitar)  When I got into my "rock phase" all I would here from my older brother and other family members/friends sre:  "omg! thats white ppl music"  "are you sure you're black?"  "whats wrong with her"    At first I would start arguments but then I realised how ignorant they were being and just ignored them. I mean, how many white people listen to rap! Loads! and most rap artist and black, so why can't it work reversed?    I have friends from different races but whenever I would hang out with a white mate it would be "look what she's (my white mate) doing to her" and my brothers mate once told my brother to "get help for your sister", like i had a ******** illness or something!    I think they don't like it because they think you're rejecting your race, which i am totally not by the way, i just happen to prefer that kind of music once in a while.|`|vBcadgYPaa	Don't let it get to you. You don't have to act black, just act like yourself. I've had a lot of my white friends tell me I don't act black because I don't talk that ghetto (I used "that" because I frequently let out my inner n-word :) but back on topic...). I like Hip-hop, I love "black movies", I study and often quote MLK, Malcolm X, the Black Panthers, and 2pac, and the best oreo accusation they could come up with was that I don't normally speak ghetto. I asked them to define being black, and they couldn't answer. I told them that just because I don't talk like those stereotypes you see on BET doesn't automatically make me not Black, and they backed off. That was my wild card, now you just have to find yours.|`|QWr0mocnaa	People are just like that - all I can say is that calling you an "oreo" is immature and very closed-minded and it's best that your don't pay any of that sort of thing any attention because it's not worth any of your emotional energy. Some people just don't like anything that is different from themselves, especially your parents.    Just ignore it. Noone has the power to change who you are, so just say "SO WHAT?" to them. Does it matter that much in the end?? You are still your parents' daughter.    Goodluck and hope that helps.|`|VEoURHoCaa	sorry this has nothing to do with the Question...but why is your avatar white? ok anways there is really no such thing as acting white and black, im kinda like that to when black people say crap like that just ignore it.|`|lHzBJA4eaa	People who " ACT Black" are pretenders and I feel embarrassed for them.It's people like that that cause all the racial tension. You are smart enough to know we are really all the same.Don't apologize for that. As for people saying tour avatar is white, hmm, mine is brown ,there was no white available. I look like I'm mixed or just light.|`|uQfJukisaa	I'm considered an oreo also just because I am not the typical black person. Telling black people they act white and that they are oreos because they don't fit black stereotype is just what happens in the black community.|`|iad9mqaXaa	Not all white people act the same. I think you are a stupid, white butt kisser. They don't care that much for you. I may date white men, but they know I'm in charge!|`|kL8BzsBNaa	Its not wrong that you dont "act black" or listen to the same music but something tells me youre ashamed of it(being black). How could they not call you and oreo when your avatar is a white girl!!! I mean, have you no respect for your people? Common, that is just ridiculous.|`|OZjlW5utaa	Listen to what you want to, rock isn't exclusive to white people as rap is to black people, Anyone can listen to whatever they want to. Your dad should be ashamed of saying that to you, you should talk to your mom about it. Some blacks don't like it because they feelyour drifting away from your culture, yes rap is part of black culture, but you can still be black and listen to music other then r&b or rap.
216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	When sitting, a woman tends to cross her legs. But should we? According to Maura Graber, who has been teaching manners to children and adults for 15 years and is the director of The R.S.V.P. Institute of Etiquette, says, "When sitting, a woman should cross her legs at the ankles. For one thing, by crossing one's legs at the knees, one is cutting off circulation and can end up with spider veins. It is not considered lady-like to cross one's legs at the knees, especially if one is wearing a short skirt."     nfd?|`|kNVLWmwUaa	i think ladies should just not sit with their legs spread open and all hunched.  sit up straight, for good posture, and have legs together or crossed.|`|Iy36xZMOaa	Anyway she wants.  Why should women be dictated to about how to sit and men not?? It's discrimination.|`|qxpbdVAJaa	my personal opinion only:    in polite company and/or at any sort of formal event: knees & ankles together, feet flat on ground; legs crossed at ankles (knees together); legs crossed at knees.    in a skirt, anywhere: see above.    in a casual setting amongst friends, in pants, do whatever.|`|AA12152549	If she's wearing a skirt, then definitely "knees together" is the rule so as to avoid flashing her panties or even more if she's having a no-panties day.  If she's wearing pants, then the knees don't always have to be slammed shut.|`|M6fzLJtmaa	Basically its keep your legs together! You can cross them...or just keep the knees touching.    When you go out look at different women and how they do it...watch the way you stand too....legs close together and not too far apart....it looks nicer and more feminine that way.    If you look at posed photos of women such as Princess Mary ( I am using her name because shes younger and very vogue right now ) you will see a few ways you can sit or stand elegantly.    When you get out of a car, dont hike one leg out and then the other! Sit with your legs together...spin your hips around to the door you are getting out of and keeping your legs together place them outside the door on the ground - then take the first step with the leg furtherest from the car door.

6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	Easter is termed a moveable feast because it is not fixed in relation to the civil calendar. Easter falls at some point between late March and late April each year (early April to early May in Eastern Christianity), following the cycle of the moon. After several centuries of disagreement, all churches accepted the computation of the Alexandrian Church (now the Coptic Church) that Easter is the first Sunday after the Paschal Full Moon, which is the first moon whose 14th day (the ecclesiastic "full moon") is on or after March 21 (the ecclesiastic "vernal equinox").|`|0hSpsSByaa	It wasn't the Catholics or Protestants.  It's based on when Passover is celebrated, and obviously Christians have no say in when that is.|`|AA11521494	It is a non-biblical tradition.  The reason the date is determined by phases of the moon was that the early church linked it to the date of the passover, and the Hebrew calendar is based on the phases of the moon rather than the 365/366 day solar year.  This is why, every few years, the Hebrew calendar inserts a whole extra month - 12 lunar months are not long enough to be a solar year and it needs that to keep up with the seasons.  (Footnote: the muslim calendar is also lunar but does not use "leap months" - this is why Ramadan gets earlier every year).|`|1EhbLBkUaa	It's not an arbitrary decision, where someone on high throws a dart at a calendar to pick the date.  Instead, it's a formula, which is the same for both churches.<br>  <br>  It actually has changed quite a bit over the centuries, absorbing traditions and timing from pagan celebrations of rebirth and Jewish Passover.  It has also been affected by differing calendar systems, so this isn't necessarily a silly question.

Don't ask me how the Orthodox set the date.|`|Nj8RHxV6aa	It is the first Sunday following the first full moon, after the spring equinox.<br>  <br>  In the time immediately following the death of Jesus, the lunar calendar of the Jewish religion and the solar, or Julian, calendar of the Romans caused confusion about the dates that events occurred, making it difficult to assign a specific date for religious celebrations. Adding to the difficulty, it seems that the date of Jesus’ resurrection was not recorded, apparently because Jesus’ followers expected Him to return soon, rendering an anniversary of the resurrection unnecessary.<br>  <br>  At the Council of Nicea, some 300 years after the death of Jesus, it was decided that a date for Easter should be established. To accommodate both lunar and Julian calendars, an accord was reached: Easter would fall on the first Sunday, following the first full moon, following the vernal (spring) equinox.<br>  <br>  As time passed, scientists realized that the Julian calendar did not correspond exactly with the actual length of the solar year, causing each Julian year to overflow slightly into the next. In the mid-1500s, Pope Gregory XIII had a Jesuit mathematician sort out the problem. He launched a new calendar, called the Gregorian, which introduced leap years to make up for the discrepancy. The Julian calendar, still used by some Eastern Orthodox churches, is now behind by about 13 days, which explains why Orthodox holidays fall on different dates.|`|cRxoNPYkaa	Easter is the commemoration of Jesus' resurrection, universally celebrated by Christians around the world. Although how and even when Easter is celebrated varies greatly. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Both Western Churches (Roman Catholic and Protestant) and Eastern Churches (Greek and Russian Orthodox) celebrate Easter on the first Sunday following the first full moon after the vernal equinox. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  There are as many as five weeks between the two Easter celebrations. In the Western Church, Easter falls between late March and late April; in the Orthodox Church, it is between early April and early May.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In the 16th century, the Roman Church abandoned the Julian Calendar in favor of the Gregorian calendar. As a result, Catholic (and eventually Protestant) churches need to convert the originally Julian-based date of Easter into a Gregorian date. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>  <br>  Even still, it would stand to reason that the date would be the same for the two Churches, since both are based on the same Julian calendar-at least originally.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  However, the two Churches also use a different system for calculating the date of the vernal equinox.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Western Church decided to set a fixed date-March 21-for the vernal equinox and then define the full moon using ecclesiastical calculations.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Orthodox Church, on the other hand, set the date for Easter based on the astronomical definitions of the full moon and the equinox, as they are observed along the meridian of Jerusalem.|`|FAtFPZbfaa	easter falls on the first Sunday following the first ecclesiastical full moon that occurs on or after the day of the vernal equinox;<br>  this particular ecclesiastical full moon is the 14th day of a<br>  tabularlunation (new moon); and<br>  the vernal equinox is fixed as March 21.|`|oMVSKGKbaa	Easter is a non christian festival that the coincides with the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  I celebrate His Resurrection, every day, every Sunday, and even on that day.<br>  <br>  The calender determines when "Easter" is.|`|agLImxKTaa	Neither idiot.

Good Friday is defined as the Friday following the first full moon after the Vernal Equinox.  As the moon has a 29.5 day cycle, the day of the full moon changes each month.  The Vernal Equinox changes as well - between 20-22 March, depending on the year, and also, depending on where you live (the International Date Line comes into play).<br>  <br>  This is the Jewish Passover time, the Friday before which is traditionally accepted as the date of Jesus' execution (Passover begins at sundown on the Friday, which is considered Saturday in the Jewish calendar system.  The day changes at sundown, not midnight).  As the Passover is based on the lunar calendar, so is Easter.<br>  <br>  Protestants, Roman Catholics, and Fundies all share the same date.  Jews can differ, due to their idea that the day changes at sundown, not midnight, but this does not happen all that often.  And, of course, the Orthodox Church still uses the old calendar, so the name for the date will be different than the Western church, although the day will be the same.|`|AA10239241	They don't.  We Catholics set that up by way of Apostolic Tradition: <br>  <br>  "We read in Eusebius (Church History V.23): "A question of no small importance arose at that time [i.e. the time of Pope Victor, about A.D. 190]. The dioceses of all Asia, as from an older tradition, held that the fourteenth day of the moon, on which day the Jews were commanded to sacrifice the lamb, should always be observed as the feast of the life-giving pasch [epi tes tou soteriou Pascha heortes], contending that the fast ought to end on that day, whatever day of the week it might happen to be. However it was not the custom of the churches in the rest of the world to end it at this point, as they observed the practice, which from Apostolic tradition has prevailed to the present time, of terminating the fast on no other day than on that of the Resurrection of our Saviour."  <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05228a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05228a.h...</a><br>  <br>  If we continued to celebrate Easter on the 14th of Nissan (the Jewish month), Easter would be celebrated earlier and earlier each year because our calendar does not add an extra month as Judaism does in their 19-year cycle.  It is also set up thus so that Easter is always on a Sunday and never any other day of the week.  third, it is set up so that the Christian Pentecost -- 50 days after Easter is celebrated roughly at the same time as the Jewish Pentecost  called Shavuot in Hebrew.

6jAVElX7aa	30-32  Jesus is telling His disciples about how He is going to be killed by man but that He will rise the third day. a prophesy which came true. 33-35 Jesus asked them what they were saying among themselves, but they did not answer Him as they had disputed among themselves who should be the greatest. Jesus knew what they thought without telling Him, So He mentions that the first will be last and the last will be first. And He pointed how to receive the kingdome of God, you had to be like a child, with total trust in Him. and if you received one of these children in His Name,  you received Christ  if you received Christ you also received the Spirit of God who sent Him As Christ also said "Suffer the little children to come unto me, for such is the kingdom of heaven."|`|JTD3M8Ziaa	The same point as reading the rest of the bible:  Nothing.|`|8lMrfgDxaa	Harold Camping knows The meaning.

Verses 33-35 it shows the 12 desciples arguing over who is greater among them according to their works.  Jesus scolds them saying that we should be servants to all who we come in contact with and be humble.  If you want to be "first" in the eyes of God, you must be the "last" by humbling yourself and serving otheres.  God's view of first and last and the world's view is exactly opposite!  Then in verses 36-37 He explains that whatever you do unto those around you, you do unto Him.  And not only Jesus, but the one who sent Jesus, God himself.  So it all ties into being a "servant" to who we meet which will actually be actions of humility to the Lord and that will bring honor to Him and you will be blessed (or first in God's eyes).|`|1iKEQ6yYaa	Jesus predicts His death [ Mark 9:30-32; Matthew 17:22-23; Luke 9:44-45]     Mark 9:33-35 The disciples argue about who would be the greatest     [vs36-37] It is important not only to treat children well but also to teach them about Jesus.|`|iNn9mmOtaa	law vs law is childish, and as long as you're childish (child vs child) you differ nothing from know not servants vs servants; so be no more children who get tossed to and fro, and rise above a servant to be free, especially the third day, for only the greatest of three things never fails    3.

I hope it helps you  The Apostles Reproved.  30 And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.   31 For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.   32 But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.   33 And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?   34 But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.   35 And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.   36 And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,   37 Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.   38 And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.   39 But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.   40 For he that is not against us is on our part.    Here, I. Christ foretels his own approaching sufferings. He passed through Galilee with more expedition than usual, and would not that any man should know of it (v. 30); because he had done many mighty and good works among them in vain, they shall not be invited to see them and have the benefit of them, as they have been. The time of his sufferings drew nigh, and therefore he was willing to be private awhile, and to converse only with his disciples, to prepare them for the approaching trial, v. 31. He said to them, The Son of man is delivered by the determinate council and fore-knowledge of God into the hands of men (v. 31), and they shall kill him. He had been delivered into the hands of devils, and they had worried him, it had not been so strange; but that men, who have reason, and should have love, that they should be thus spiteful to the Son of man, who came to redeem and save them, is unaccountable. But still it is observable that when Christ spoke of his death, he alway spoke of his resurrection, which took away the reproach of it from himself, and should have taken away the grief of it from his disciples. But they understood not that saying, v. 32. The words were plain enough, but they could not be reconciled to the thing, and therefore would suppose them to have some mystical meaning which they did not understand, and they were afraid to ask him; not because he was difficult of access, or stern to those who consulted him, but either because they were loth to know the truth, or because they expected to be chidden for their backwardness to receive it. Many remain ignorant because they are ashamed to enquire.    II. He rebukes his disciples for magnifying themselves. When he came to Capernaum, he privately asked his disciples what it was they disputed among themselves by the way, v. 33. He knew very well what the dispute was, but he would know it from them, and would have them to confess their fault and folly in it. Note, 1. We must all expect to be called to an account by our Lord Jesus, concerning what passes while we are in the way in this state of passage and probation. 2. We must in a particular manner be called to an account about our discourses among ourselves; for by our words we must be justified or condemned. 3. As our other discourses among ourselves by the way, so especially our disputes, will be all called over again, and we shall be called to an account about them. 4. Of all disputes, Christ will be sure to reckon with his disciples for their disputes about precedency and superiority: that was the subject of the debate here, who should be the greater, v. 34. Nothing could be more contrary to the two great laws of Christ's kingdom, lessons of his school, and instructions of his example, which are humility and love, than desiring preferment in the world, and disputing about it. This ill temper he took all occasions to check, both because it arose from a mistaken notion of his kingdom, as if it were of this world, and because it tended so directly to be debasing of the honour, and the corrupting of the purity, of his gospel, and, he foresaw, would be so much the bane of the church.    Now, (1.) They were willing to cover this fault (v. 34); they held their peace. As they would not ask (v. 32), because they were ashamed to own their ignorance, so here they would not answer because they were ashamed to own their pride. (2.) He was willing to amend this fault in them, and to bring them to a better temper; and therefore sat down, that he might have a solemn and full discourse w|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Jesus was teaching and training his disciples to teach and preach the Kingdom of God once he had left the earth.He knew beforehand what would happen.Because he had lived with his father in the heavens.  Colossians 1:16  The disciples did not get the point of humility and this is what he wanted to teach them.    Matthew 20:20-23 Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee approached him (Jesus) with her sons doing obeisance and asking for something from him.he said to her:"What do you want?" she said to him:"Give the word that these my two sons may sit down one at your right hand and one at your left in your Kingdom.    He said to them:You will indeed drink my cup,but this sitting down at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give,but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.    Jesus seeing their scheme would not let himself be manipulated by family members.  Also he showed subjection to his Father,and that he did not have this authority to give that request only his Father did.    He sensing their pride ,took the little child in his arms saying whoever recieves one of such young children on the basis of my name ,recieves me ,recieves not me only but also him that sent me forth.    Matthew 20:26 he said :"Whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister,and whoever among you who wants to be first must be your slave.Just as the Son of Man came not to be ministered to but came to minister and give his soul as a ransom in exchange for many.    An example of a little child was appropiate,because little children are very humble and forgiving.They will be mad at one minute and forgiving the next,they don't hold grudges.And Jesus was teaching his disciples to be that way and it is also a lesson for us today.|`|AA12384132	Jesus is preparing his disciples for his forth coming death and transition...

Or if it is a different hour in the day, devote a small space in your home to it and make a point of going in that room everyday, then you shouldn't forget.Blessed Be and good luck.|`|FmazIF6Maa	Try doing it at the same time each day.

And Obama is more White than Black. Didn't you know? He's 50% White, 43.75% Arab, and only 6.25% Black. That low percentage doesn't even legally qualify him as Black, since you have to be at least 12.5% of a given minority to be able to claim it as yours.    Obama being 'Black' was the cornerstone of his campaign, because without it he would've been an Arab-American running for office and that would not fly.

In the book of John, Jesus enters the City of Jerusalem, during Passover, on the back of a donkey.  This is one of literally hundreds of fulfilled prophecies.  Someone gave you a link.

The Bible predicted several thousand years ago that Israel would be dispersed among the nations and then in the last days would return from the four corners of the earth and the state of Israel would be reestablished in the land of Palestine. There are even some minute details predicted such as that there would be a flying over Jerusalem before its fall. The day before General Allenby captured Jerusalem at the end of the first world war, a plane, which few people had even seen n those days flew over Jerusalem and the Arabs not knowing what it was fled.

Look at what you've got so far: stuff about "The last days" (Mind you, the same argument has been used for centuries, but it turned out that those weren't the last days, and neither are these), The messiah (I write a book saying that in 20 years time Harry Potter will walk into a West End Pub in a hawaiian t-shirt and order a martini, then my fans write a book 50 years from now, saying that 30 years before Harry Potter walked into a West End Pub in a hawaiian t-shirt and ordered a martini, there goes your prophecy), and Israel (a people who spent two thousand years trying to go back because a book told them that they would go back).

WpA7n8Iwaa	Why would somebody answer this when you include a threat right in your question?  How could somebody presume to speak for God and tell you why He chose the Jewish people?  That kind of makes it sound like God was wondering the earth looking for a race and decided on them.  Isn't the truth that God chose one faithful man (Abraham) and decided to create nations from Him?  God decided to make a people to use as an example for how God works in the world.  God has blessed and protected the Jewish race, but he has also punished them and used them as an example for what happens when people ignore and disobey God.  They are the most amazing race of people on the earth, even though you probably hate hearing that.|`|5tMCDu8gaa	*rolls eyes* Jesus was just some dude born to a Bronze Age desert tribe.|`|bb2fb83f62e8d0f381f54d42036a5791aa	He wanted to be sure that his son came from a place where people can't get along with each other.|`|4yYUCcg1aa	That is a very good question.

1TuIuuXdaa	As with most European languages, French has the remnants of a case system in terms of its personal pronouns. Elle means she, on the whole, but can also mean her - but only in CERTAIN contexts. For example, "Elle habite  Paris" translates as "She lives in Paris". "C'est  elle" translates as "It's hers", or "It belongs to her". HOWEVER, "it's her book" would be "c'est son livre", as said by the previous poster. "It's her doll" would be "c'est sa poupe".    Unfortunately, in a lot of contexts, the English word "her" translates as "lui": "Je lui ai donn un caf" - "I gave her a coffee". In general, think of "elle" as "she" because "her" in English has many different potential translations. Treat "her" as a different word to "she" altogether, and address it pragmatically.|`|8w2o6qHyaa	Yes you can!|`|8d019f874338228cbb13815ff881635baa	yea elle means her /she  so u can definitly say Elle habite meaning she lives .......|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Yes unless it's possessive.

She knows absolutely nothing about my sister's.  Guess which one of us has a less complicated love life?

A friend of mine who did says her mom treated it like a joke for a while, and then just ignored it.  People react all sorts of ways.  For your part, keeping an even temper is the best thing you can do.|`|kgAmVqqzaa	just say 2 ur parents, "i have something 2 tell u... i love u both so much and i just want you 2 accept it... im bisexual." i havent told my parents yet and i hav no idea how or if im gonna do it. i mean, i plan on telling them eventually, but i hav no idea how im gonna... i guess its easier said than done... good luck!!! =)
97d50db6a834f02ae3b73b75b4c0a135aa	How about a sewing machine, or tickets to a fashion show. The last option is a shopping day and let her know her limit is fifty dollars (or less your choice) and lunch together. I went on a day of beauty with my 13 year old, we got our hair and nails done and bought new shirts then had a nice lunch talking about it...I made her a coupon that said " Good for one day of being spoiled" and explained the terms on the back. <br>  Good luck!|`|G4wDlSh7aa	maybe a scrap-booking kit, that yall could make together.<br>  or a charm bracelet, her first charm could say BFF or something.<br>  or some shoes!<br>  every girl lovess shoes.<br>  lol, good luck.<br>  :)|`|Rx8U8eVnaa	Well you could get her a build a bear and dress it up and make it look really nice for her.<br>  P.S.

Entrance to The British Natural History Museum (the best one) is completely free.<br>  <br>  Maybe like in See Dee's town, everyone has gone 'up the pole'.|`|41ISfvXmaa	Not sure.  Actually the Museum here in my town has been shut down within the last year. Guess not many are that interested. However, 2 new churches have built within 5 miles of me in the past year and 1/2.|`|9q95w6vyaa	The dinosaurs must have really pissed God off.

I bet you'll get the hang of it!!|`|gAuIixm6aa	People have figured this out for millenia before the internet was invented. You can figure it out too. Good luck|`|FgaBo4Eraa	Don't worry it is a fairly natural process. When the time comes you'll know what to do, a good partner will also guide you through it :)|`|UtXjDzjKaa	do it the way you see it on TV|`|MyzX8WcEaa	Kissing a guy is great. All you need to do is play it cool, make sure that he wants to kiss you to, by staring into his eyes. If you are shy, let him lean in first, if he wants to kiss you, he will lean in first. And after that, just go with the flow.    p.s Make sure that your breath doesn't smell like a sewage plant, because there is nothing worse than a bad breath kiss.|`|CmVlLsbZaa	The slower you go the more in control you are, just remain calm and press you lips against his, and you'll see, it's really not that mysterious.     And don't worry, you don't have to think about your tongue for the first time.    Breath.. just breath :)|`|hyYWX82Eaa	Don't worry, you'll pretty much just know.     And it's all for fun and pleasure, the first time I actually made out I bumped teeth with my gf a few times. It wasn't embarrassing, it didn't ruin anything but it made us both laugh and mellowed things out a lot.     Just relax! And use a nice tasting chapstick ^_~ Good luck! |`|eM8dg4knaa	It sorta comes naturally, you shouldn't threat over it. You just touch there lips with your and if you not that confident with it then let the person you're kissing lead.

AQPmrsVSaa	A lot of youths are used to being treated as immature and undeserving of respect. Teenagers are always being told they're too young for this and that, or that they can't be trusted, and many of them just wish people would recognize what they're capable of and treat them like adults. Pedophiles often gain girls' trust and affection by giving them the mature treatment they've always wanted.    As for those who prey on girls without consent, those are pretty obviously not the girls' faults. Yes, some caution should be exercised, but most girls get sexually assaulted by adults who were already in their lives and who they've been told they should be able to trust, like fathers, uncles, teachers, etc.|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	How can you say that?      The problem is NOT with the young girl who is underage...the problem is with the GROWN MAN who knows better than to approach a child or adolescent in an inappropriate manner and yet they still do it anyway!!!!      A pedophile is the lowest life form there is.    EDIT    Your comment is an insult to survivors of child sexual abuse everywhere. Who are you some pedophile who is trying to justify your actions? You ought to be ashamed of yourself...and those who agree with him, likewise.|`|pCzkCKafaa	I wouldn't make such a general statement like that, I know quite a few that stupid and a lot who can sniff them out. I personally think it's because these older men knows what a teenage girl wants to hear and forms himself into the 'perfect guy', when really he's just a creep.|`|TfijWwsYaa	yeah, I think and wonder how the hell I could have been so stupid when I was a young girl.  It goes through my mind often.|`|lcXBO7Smaa	think about it, women don't rape guys... think about how that would work.     As for your first question, I don't know|`|lfbwOeQpaa	I totally agree with you man. I mean they is so stupid, I say that their dad got in a car accident and I'm going to pick them up to go to the hospital, and they always get in the car.     But don't let all these feminist bastards on here say that it's the man's fault. I've been raped like 40 times by girls.

GnKsUHUmaa	It possibly is, either you can wear piercings or you can't, I don't think it's fair to say you can only wear ear piercings. I think schools say that because they believe all other piercings look a bit rebellious.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	No, it is the adults in charge trying to reduce distractions to learning.  You will find that school-children, even high scholars, do NOT have full adult privileges, and anti-discrimination laws specifically give school authorities the power to control any activities they consider disruptive.  So grow up and quit fighting it - you will encounter far more than enough battles once you're an adult.
stAeoUeSaa	Soon there will be the so called "disclosure" of supposed type III "aliens" under the tenure of Obama any time from 2009 to 2012! WHAT A COINCIDENCE!

Read 2 Peter 2:4, Jude 6, Amos 9:2 , and the books of Enoch, Jasher, and Jubilees   JUST DO NOT EVER ACCEPT THIS:  http://www.verichipcorp.com/|`|YYbVDcw8aa	I certainly hope we are not the pinnacle of creation, If we ever meet them I wonder how the Jesus stuff will work?|`|n3R7DJ52aa	Aliens are either gonna come and kick our @$$ or we're gonna go kick some alien race's @$$|`|jTNa0lwAaa	I think it would be egotistical for us not to think there are aliens. I think that most likely at some point in the future we will come into contact with them. Live among them, maybe, but i doubt it. It would take a long, long time for humans to except living along side aliens. We do not today except living among aliens from our own planet no less another.     We will go to another galaxy. I think that eventually science will get there. I mean science always seems to get to places we never thought possible. The only reason it will take longer than our lifetimes is that it will take that long for it to become profitable.
qjvAquFnaa	omg i am glad that someone asked this because my dog just ran away and it is 10 degrees outside.  and i think that my girlfriend is cheating on me with my neighbor because she is always at his house, and they are claiming that they are working on a science project on electrical currents in different types of metals.  this is bothering me because she took science last trimester.  i lost my wallet on the public bus, and it had my money, id cards, credit card, and my prescription paper.  i just found out that i am allergic to penicillin, and that now i have to tell my other doctors that so I now have to be careful.  and my step-brother just got out of jail, he was there for tax evasion, which he is now trying to ask me for money so he can go out and hit the clubs.  and he is like 23, omg i think he took my wallet on the bus because he was acting very suspicious.|`|a61m9ASGaa	nothing.....hehe?|`|znGBUQYIaa	homework.....  i can tell you're bored :D

Why would they do that????|`|ddee4fdfcea9ecef7ac3cad0bf86b332aa	personally I don't do that but whatever makes you happy|`|AA12307181	Well, it depends.  Are they wearing pants?

HAHA whoever doesn't like it hates it or just down right makes fun of it. Ignorance is your problem, and you just think of your appearance and what everybody thinks of you. No its's not disgusting or weird. It's actually comfortable, and plus it's nothing to make fun of or be ashamed of. Get a sense of humor :)    Plus if you can walk around your neighboor hood wearing these, and have no issues. You're practically a nice out going person who's not afraid of what people say.|`|9oTCe1g2aa	it's super sexy|`|Iy36xZMOaa	I don't judge them one way or the other.

Or there's something wrong with their toes.|`|AA10819407	They may be comfortable...|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	Well, as dorky as it looks, I have to think they have courage to not care and go for sensible and comfortable.......I hate getting sand or rocks in my sandals......|`|Z7ZE1lAJaa	I walk away from them very slowly
4eTyCuRSaa	Here is an example   Nuclear Energy.      A positive influence in that we now have a huge power source.     A negative, just ask those at Chernobyl or Love Island|`|pcHCLfZkaa	Depends on the "technological advance" you're speaking of.    It would be illegal to create a machine to kill, so I don't get the logic in this question.    Edit: Well, when you put it like that, then yes.    A lot of technology we have today is causing lung cancer, and other diseases.     When you think about it, there is a cost for such great things. But with 'advances' as you put it, let's hope it stops. For the better, at least.    I don't know any other things except for the Hybrid, and other environmentally safe things that are considered 'advances', so this is the best answer I can give.

Do you have any friendly relatives -- grandparents, uncle or aunt -- that you might move in with?    Or any family of a friend who would take you in?  Or a friend you could live with?

That doesn't mean that you don't get to have "the conversation" with him, but think in terms of a war/ as a general.    First, identify the strengths and weaknesses of both sides (you & your dad).    Next, think about creating a few "emergency exits" (emotionally and physically) when your deciding on the field of battle (do you want to talk to him outside so you can get away, run to a car and drive off?  Or perhaps in a public place (like a coffee shop or shopping mall) where there are other people and he'll be less likely to attack (verbally and physically)?    Third, think about a few things you say to him that will totally disarm him.  If he's constantly pointing out things about you that are similar to him (or his father/brother/etc), when he's raging - in a calm manner, ask if he's really mad at _____ about ______?   It might inflame him - but will probably stop him long enough for you to run for cover if necessary.    Fourth, create a safe haven (whether that means waiting until you can move out on your own or in with friends/relatives) or it means getting locks for your bedroom door/window (and if you choose that route - make sure that you have a cell phone with you in case you need to call for help).    Once you have all of those things lined up, THEN you can start the conversation.  But I would also suggest talking to a counselor (or a priest - you don't have to be Catholic to speak to them, and they'd be in a good position to help you interact with your family and believe me, they've heard EVERYTHING, so you won't be shocking them - besides many members of the clergy have classes specific to family counseling... and you don't have to go to a preist, you can talk to a nun, or a minister, or a rabbi -- while the theological beliefs are a bit different, they all follow the same roots).    Good Luck.  I wasn't that different than you are right now.  My mother's family were Roman Catholic, but she married my father (who was Protestant) and they turned their backs on her - but then my father died and she wanted to go back to them, but "because of me", she couldn't (and she told me about it every day.... how I ruined her life...).  My mother and I never saw eye to eye and she never appreciated me for who I was because every time she looked at me, she saw my father - and she couldn't get past that.  While I know that was HER problem, not mine, I paid a very high price for her fear, grief, anger and reign of terror.  I still feel empty, even though she's gone now, that she just couldn't get past her own issues to see that I was actually a decent person, who had gotten past the hate and built a good life for myself.    Last bit of advice - remember to ALWAYS have a back door (or two) open when you're interacting with your dad because YOU DO NOT DESERVE TO BE TREATED THAT WAY.    PS  For what it's worth, the music, the sexuality, the drinking, smoking - those aren't what the "real" issue is about.  I'm a straight female who's a conservative, republican, born-again Christian - it doesn't matter if your grunge/screamo or like someone out of Norman Rockwell - angry parents are angry parents.  I wanted to add that part because it's so easy for others to "label" and point at things that really aren't the REAL problem and it sounds like that's what your dad is doing with you.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams.

Everthing has to be in tune. <br>  <br>  I can tell you how it worked for me once:<br>  <br>  My dog was murdered - someone poisoned her - and she had a very bloody, gruesome, and painful death. I responsible for her death and for years afterwards I couldn't think about her without crying and feeling upset.<br>  <br>  I had a chance to walk a labyrinth at a conference and decided to pray for my grief to go away. As I walked I prayed by asking God to show me that she was in heaven and not suffering, by sending me a sign. Then I thought, I had better ask for a very specific sign, so I asked to see another dog that looked just like her. She was a black & brown mixed breed, part long-haired dachsund, and I had never seen another dog like her. <br>  <br>  That night I went out to dinner at a restaurant, and as I was walking back to my car in the parking lot I saw a woman sitting in her car with the door open and a dog on her lap. The dog looked exactly like my dog. The hair stood up on the bag of my neck, and I took a step closer to make sure of what I was seeing. The dog started barking and I asked the woman what kind of dog it was. She replied that it was a long-haired dachsund. After that, I never felt sad when I thought about my dog's death again. <br>  <br>  I agree with the above poster who said that the Law of Attraction is a powerful principle in prayer.

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

AQPmrsVSaa	Disease-causing microorganisms only became well-known and widely accepted in the scientific community in the mid-1800s, so I'm willing to bet that the simplest cause would be lack of proper diagnosis, leading to a lack of proper treatments.    I believe smallpox were an epidemic in North America in the 1700s, but they affected the aboriginal peoples much more than Europeans, most of whom had some natural resistance to it.    I will guess that living conditions during that period were pretty crummy to begin with, though. The French colonies were fighting with the English, and everyone was struggling to get by. Cold Canadian winters put a stress on people's health as well.

It is not a religion, believe it or not, it is the title of Christianity, as Protestant is the title of; from the 1st Century: SIMONIANS , CERINTHEIANS; 2nd Century: BASILIDIANS, ARPOCRATIANS, VALENTINIANS, MARCIONITES, CERDONIANS, EBIONITES, DOCETAE, MONTANISTS, ENCRATITES, ALOGI, MONARCHIANS, ADOPTIONIST, ADAMITES, ANTIDICOMARIANITES ; 3rd Century: TERTULLIANISTS, ORIGENISTS, NOVATIANS, MANICHEANS, MILLENARIANS; 4th Century: DONATISTS, AUDAEANS, ARIANS, MACEDONIANS, MASSALIANS, AERIANS, APOLLINARISTS, PRISCILLIANISTS, JOVINIANS, VIGILANTIANS; 5th Century: PELAGIANS, SEMIPELAGIANS, NESTORIANS, PREDESTINARIANS, MONOPHYSITES; 7th Century: MONOTHELITES, PAULICIANS; 8th Century: ICONOCLASTS, ADOPTIONISTS; 9th century: GREEK-RUSSIAN; 11th Century: BOGOMILISTS, BERENGARIANS; 12th century: PETROBROSIANS, HENRICIANS, WALDENSES; 13th century: ALBIGENSES, FRATICELLI, FLAGELLANTS; 14th century: LOLLARDS; 15th Century (Known as the Protestant revolt): HUSSITES , ANABAPTISTS, OSIANDRISTS, ZWINGLIANS, PRESBYTERIANS, LUTHERANS, SACRAMENTARIANS, MENNONITES, EPISCOPALIANS OR ANGLICANS, CALVINISTS ,UNITARIANS, SOCINIANS, HUGUENOTS, REFORMED DUTCH, CONGREGATIONALISTS; 16th century: BAPTISTS, JANSENISTS, UNIVERSALISTS, MUFFLETONIANS, QUAKERS; 18th century: MORAVIANS, METHODISTS, SHAKERS, SWEDENBORGIANS, MICHAELIANS; 19th century: GERMAN REFORMED, DISCIPLES OF CHRIST, TRUE REFORMED DUTCH, HICKSITES, MORMONS, CATHOLIC APOSTOLICAL CHURCH, PERFECTIONISTS, ADVENTISTS, SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS, SALVATION ARMY, CHRISTIAN SCIENTISTS, OLD CATHOLICS, MODERNISTS, DOWIEITES, JEHOVAHS WITNESSES, CHURCH OF GOD IN CHRIST, CHURCH OF CHRIST, HOLINESS CHURCHES, CHURCH OF GOD; 20th century: PENTECOSTAL, UNITED UNITARIAN UNIVERSALIST ASSOCIATION.  In other words Protestant is just as what it is implying, some denomination that is Protesting against the Doctrine and Church of Christ, the Roman Catholic Church.    ? / katholikos is a Greek adjective which means universal.  Among other places, in the concluding verses of the Gospel of St. Matthew (28, 19-20), and St. Mark (16, 15-16): Go into the whole world and preach the gospel to every creature. He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned.    Compare St. John, 10, 16: And other sheep I have that are not of this fold.   Them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold and one shepherd.    Of course the name Catholic was not given to the Church of Christ until after the time of the New Testament.   It was commonly called merely The Church or Holy Church.    There was no need to distinguish.   There was only one Church.    St. Ignatius seems to have been the first to give the name Catholic to The Church.   He did this in a letter he wrote about the year 110, and in the course of the next two centuries the name caught on, and came into general use.   By that time there were a few heresies in vogue, like Arianism, and "Catholic" became a name to distinguish the true Church from error and schism.    In the beginning the word catholic was simply an adjective meaning universal.   Then it came to have the meaning of "one and only" and to be used as an appellativea proper name for the Church.   This appellative use did not become common until the fourth century.    The Apostles Creed in the beginning had I believe in the Holy Church. The word Catholic was inserted in the fourth century.   Some Protestants have now thrown this word Catholic out of the Creed and frankly substituted the word Christian.    As for the word Roman, that is an Anglicanismconsidered superfluous by all continental Europeans.   It is like calling a man by his confirmation name, in addition to his baptismal and family names.    The word Roman Catholic really came from the legislative enactments of Protestant England.   They tried to pretend that there was another Catholic Church, namely, the English Catholic.   Hence the name "Roman" was needed to distinguish the two.   We still employ the consequences of their fiction.    You must understand that before the 15th century Christianity was una (one and unified; universal) as God decreed "One Lord, one faith, one baptism." (Eph. 4, 5) One faith would be the doctrine of Christ, any doctrine that is in contestation of Christ's doctrine is false, and cannot be apart of this "One Faith." The truth is that Protestants (which is the title of those who have protested against the Roman Catholic Church), Lutheran, Anglican, Anabaptist, Baptist, etc. are not Christians, or at least not True Christians. As I said the Term Christian before 1500 A.D. was one (Faith, Church, & Doctrine), and after Martin Luther split along with other men and women, the term Christian became many (Denominations, Sub-denominations, faiths, & doctrines all contradicting and in conflict with one another). But that goes against Our Heavenly Lord's decree does it not? (Eph. 4, 5).    Now my question is, is this a sincere question, or are you simply looking for someone that is in agreement with you?|`|zBqt99avaa	because we ARE Christians.

The name 'Christian' identifies a person that believes Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the saviour and redeemer of the world, and that by coming to know and acknowledge this, and also being determined to please him by conforming your life to his teachings in order to access the salvation he offers to all.    The name 'Catholic' is from the Latin, and means 'Universal.'      The Christians churches long ago accepted that Christianity as a universal religion, and included the term in their denominational description [Name].    All Roman Catholics are Christians, but not all Christians are Roman Catholics.    Other denominations that accept Jesus as the Son of God [see John 3.16-17], are Christians, but all Christians are demarcated by the name of their denomination, ie, Presbyterian, Methodist [all branches], Moravian Brethren, Baptists [all branches], Apostolic, Pentecostal [all branches],Mormons, Anglicans [all branches], Congregationalist, Ecclesia of Christ, Christadelphians, and so on.    You can call a Baptist a Baptist, but that does not mean they are Christians.

(I typed that really slowly)|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Catholicism is not Christian. Here's why:     The first Christians in ACTS in the Bible were NOT CATHOLIC. They were fundamentalist in doctrine. Read Acts for yourself and see.     Catholicism didn't exist for over 300 years later.     Catholicism teaches a false gospel of works ("sacraments") that leads to eternal hell (Galatians 1:6-9). Catholicism is not Christian    Jesus wants to have a personal relationship with you. Catholicism cannot give you this.     Catholicism = faith + works = no salvation and eternal torment in hell    Christian = faith alone in Jesus for salvation, without our own works added = salvation and eternity in heaven with Jesus! :)     Only faith alone in Jesus saves! Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross and rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|vdM9AJDtaa	DONT DO THEY?|`|b1e7acd9969e11fd38ae40bfed0968bfaa	There are many denominations under the Christian umbrella, Catholicism is one of them.

g3Uogm7Haa	Absolutely!  Honestly, look at the different portions of the bible.  I'm not an expert or a scholar, but in Genesis the creation story discusses one man, Adam, and one woman, Eve, as being responsible for seeding our entire civilization.  Is it really possible for ALL people on earth, as diverse as we are, to trace their ancestry back to one man and one woman?  The Bible also provides guidelines and often strict rules on how to live life.  It discusses what to do and what not to do.  I believe that the Bible holds some universal truths, but at the same time encompasses fictional stories (lies) in order to ensure that man (people) acts civilized.  I believe some of these stories are designed to teach and should not be taken literally.  But the genius  of it is to threaten people who do not conform with damnation of their souls for eternity.       In regards to lies, there are claims that certain gospels are left out of the bible, particularly gospels discussing Mary Magdalene.  Mary Magdalene is traditionally portrayed as a prostitute, but may have been the wife of Jesus.  Why?  Why would the church want to hide this womans role in history?  By not telling the truth they are telling a lie.  So, to answer your question, YES, there are possibly lies throughout the Bible.  The book "Holy Blood, Holy Grail" touches on some of the lies told by the church.  It is the book the "Davinchi Code" is based on and a good objective read.          I think you wrote a great question.  Whether my answer is right or wrong, I believe we should always question everything and not just accept it on face value.  The deeper you dig, the more truths (or lies) you may uncover.

Psalm 104:5     He set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved.     Isaiah 11:12 (KGV)     He will set up a banner for the nations, and will assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.    isaiah 40:22   22 He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth,          and its people are like grasshoppers.          He stretches out the heavens like a canopy,          and spreads them out like a tent to live in.    The Bible actually teaches a spherical shape for the earth. In Isaiah 40:22 God is said to sit above the circle of the earth (the Hebrew word for circle can also mean a sphere). Also, in Luke 17:3436 Christ's Second Coming is portrayed as occurring while some are asleep at night and others are working at daytime activities  which means a rotating earth with day and night at the same time.    THE BIBLE IS NOT LITERAL EVERYONE THINKS ITS LITERAL ITS NOT. YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT APART AND SEE WHAT ITS TRYING TO SAY. THERE IS A GOD, BECAUSE HOW WERE WE FORMED? THERE WASN'T SOME CELL JUST FLOATING AROUND AND THE POOF THERES HUMANS? NO, WHAT MADE THAT CELL?    the bible is simply explaining how to life live the godly way.    2 Timothy 3:16  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,    Everyone of you people who said that the bible is a lie   are ignorant, have any one of you even read the bible?    if you have not read the bible, and don't even know whats in it,   i suggest you shut your mouth go actually do some research, and then come back and say how religion is a lie.

216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	First of all, I think where people run into a problem with this is that they don't have their priorities in check. If you don't know what you want out of your life and have a lack of focus, you're more likely to get talked into things that aren't necessarily bad but over time had a lot of stress and distractions. You take the time with this, everything else gets easier. When it comes down to telling someone "no," first tell the person thank you for thinking of you. In most cases, they are paying you a compliment in considering you a responsible person. Give a reason behind why you're saying "no." A lot of times people don't realize how busy other people are, and the majority of the time they're going to be understanding.

The other person will likely appreciate you networking for them.     nfd?|`|r9s0VyJgaa	"No, thank you."     Works every time.

My sister and little niece are the only family members who I go nude with. The rest of my family would freak!

On the other hand, "L'aranciA" is feminine.

AA12139712	The truth is "I do not know.  I wasn't even aware that Hitler was a Catholic.  However, and it is my personal opinion and nothing to do with the official Vatican stand, if I were in a position to decide, I would not have ex-communicated Hitler, or any one for the criminals.  If we were to ex-communicate people for going against the laws of God, no one would survive.  All are sinners, some may have committed one murder, some many, some may have sinned in other ways, but all are sinners.  The Catholic Church shows us the way by interpreting God's laws but the decision to condemn rests with God, not the Catholic Church.|`|GW8LVWT8aa	Well for one, Pope Pius XII congratulated Hitler on the eve of his invasion of Russia...|`|Q7ovix19aa	I didn't think he was a practicing Catholic.|`|n7qcfWxkaa	Because they never asked ME for my opinion. If would have said to excommunicate him.|`|vAbATcTcaa	I do not know.  Would you try to disicpline a dog with rabies?|`|iHDYncuXaa	http://www.remnantofgod.org/NaziRCC/hitl...|`|N53y9qohaa	Hello,    1) Hitler is dead and faced his maker 64 years ago so excommunication is a moot point.    2) Hitler in reality excommunicated himself when he left the Church and sacraments at a very early age. You do not have to receive formal letters and pomp to be excommunicated. For example if I desecrate the Holy Communion, run an abortion clinic or help in such an act, I am automatically excommunicated even though the Bishop or the Vatican can may not know of my actions.    3) Excommunication means I am not entitled to receive the sacraments though I am still obliged to attend church services or not barred from communicating with the parishioners and clergy.      4) Denying that the Holocaust did not occur or numbers murdered have been greatly exaggerated is stupid, a sloppy knowledge of history and poor scholarship but not a sin in itself so long as you are not saying this to promote hatred against the Jews.    A an analogy, if I deny the teaching that the American Revolution was just a sham and its ideals a big lie because the British had to raise taxes to pay for the 40 year French - Indian wars to drive France off the continent which just about bankrupted their treasury, should I necessarily be just told I am off in my thinking since I am ignoring the issue was taxation without representation or face being kicked out of my career for upsetting a bunch of people?    Anyway the Bishops have told the pope they are going to shut their mouths and tow the line so this should be the end of the matter.      Cheers,    Michael Kelly|`|ds3eJjUNaa	He excommunicated himself the church doesn't have to do anything,,,      some words from the paper hanger leader of the protestant Germany who exterminated 6 million jews and 11 million Polish catholics..    I do insist on the certainty that sooner or later  once we hold power  Christianity will be overcome and the German Church established. Yes, the German church, without a Pope ....and Luther, if he could be with us, would give us his blessing. (Adolf Hitler, Hitlers speeches, edited by Prof. N.H. Baynes [oxford, 1942], pg. 369.)|`|gkffZHF2aa	Since this seems to be of such burning importance to you, why don't you just inquire of the Vatican instead of badgering Catholic laypeople about it who are two generations (or more) removed?  I don't see how they're supposed to be answerable to you.  The Pope himself has an e-mail address.  Knock yourself out.|`|W5rxQbbhaa	If you've ever studied the history of the Catholic church, their are alot of crazy things the church did in the past, definitely not the way Jesus taught us.  Interior Castle.....evidently you never studied the real history of the Catholic Church. You were probably just told about it through rose colored glasses by your clergy. Thats like when the Cigarette Co. tells you smoking doesn't cause you cancer.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	How stupid !!!    Any physical move against the CHURCH is automatic excommunication. Stupid, stupid, stupid.     "  "All who kill, mutilate, strike, seize, incarcerate, detain or pursue with hostile intent, cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, legates or nuncios of the Holy See, or drive them from their dioceses, jurisdictions, estates, or domains, as also those who ratify these measures or further them by aid or countenance." ...to safeguard the prelates or superiors in whom the Church has lodged her jurisdiction. The text clearly indicates the acts punished by excommunication, i.e. all violent attacks on the person of a prelate as such; it likewise specifies the culprits, i.e. those who perpetrate such assaults and those who are responsible for them, as also their active accomplices."    If I were standing next to you I would have to be restrained.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Look up the photos of the "pope" hugging Hitler and having a grand old time with him.  The "Vatican" funded the Nazis.    Catholicism is not Christian.  Catholicism teaches a false gospel of works that leads to eternal torment in hell (Galatians 1:6-9).|`|93galWG1aa	This is off the top of my head, but seeing as 3 million Catholics died in the camps(something many seem to know nothing about) it would probably have been an un wise move as it would have antagonised further reprisals.|`|b1e7acd9969e11fd38ae40bfed0968bfaa	Someone is excommunicated for working against the faith or the church.    Cut and past from wki:  According to the Catholic Church, excommunication, in the sense of a formal proceeding, is not a penalty, but rather a formal proclamation of a pre-existing condition in a more or less prominent member of the Catholic Church. When such a person commits acts that in themselves separate him from the communion of the faithful, particularly when by word, deed, or example he or she "spreads division and confusion among the Faithful", it is necessary for the Church to clarify the situation by means of a formal announcement, which informs the laity that this is not a person to follow, and notifies the clergy that the person, by their own willful acts, has separated from the Church and is no longer to receive the sacraments, with the exception of Reconciliation.     Of course murder is a sin but murder will not get you excommunicated.  King Henry VIII was excommunicated because he said "I, not the Pope, am the head of the Catholic church in England".|`|AA12203324	The Church does not excommunicate dead people.  It would be pointless.  Excommunication simply means one is no longer an official member of the Church and therefore can no longer receive communion.  Hitler is extremely unlikely to appear at church now.

Good work finding an obscure quote like that.|`|e248fbf4bda3b339c8800122c1551870aa	I don't really think that paragraph is even proof against evolution.  Just because there are "gaps" it doesn't mean that evolution doesn't exist. It just means they have yet to uncover the evidence. But yeah, I've heard people use that argument against evolution. I just dismiss them as not being able to comprehend it. The truth is that they have found smooth transitions of species (eg trilobites, horses evolution of the hoof, etc. ) but the fundamentalists really only want proof of human transitions.    But anyway, you really took a lot of effort to prove a point. Kudos.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	I gave you a star before you even asked.    Buying a subscription to expose dishonesty... it's worth a star.

Inspiring.|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	No, because your "detective" work is biased toward evolution before you even start.  Whether the quote was attributed to him or not, the quote is still 100% true. In 34 years, nothing science has discovered has changed the validity of that statement. One could just as easily say that Einstein's Theory of Relativity is 70 years old, so it's out of date and can't be trusted. Likewise, Darwin's theory (little "t") of evolution is 150 years old and out of date, so maybe we should just throw it out? In the last 150 years, the only thing the evolutionists have found to support their pet theory are hoaxes and misinterpretations of true facts.  The fossil record is still very much supportive of a worldwide Flood. Nothing has changed.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Lord Carey the former Archbishop of Canterbury put ,it rather well  Creationism is the fruit of a fundamentalist approach to scripture, ignoring scholarship and critical learning, and confusing different understandings of truth!!|`|66ae930022bf29f4c8379012ac4ae691aa	Any "evolutionist", which is any person who "believes or supports evolutionary theory", (which, therefore, I am also an "evolutionist") who believes that there are no discovered intermediate forms of life ought to be hanged.    That's like a football players saying "we haven't yet determined what to call the greatest football game a league could play in a season (superbowl)".    Great investigative work.  These people are liars and scumbags.  There are currently more than seven hundred "intermediate species" that have been discovered.

The fact is, creationism is good for nothing.    There should be laws against those academic predators that openly prey on our children with Creationism nonsense. They should suffer the same fate as their sexual predator cohorts.    I don't know about the hereafter, but here on earth science has been and probably always will be our one and only savior.    BTW, evolution has never laid any claim as to creation. Nor has it ever implied so. It merely recounts the events that has happened through earths history.|`|oGqssgJLaa	I find it very good. Congratulations, you have a critical attitude which many lack. Of course, I'll have to check if you are accurate.|`|ATsdSM7saa	I have a feeling that this is not the only case like this.

Star for you. :) Keep it coming, that was an interesting read. It's nice to see someone that is actually interested in finding the truth, rather than just furthering their own agenda.|`|fqLo4HvKaa	If Creationists would look at the facts like you, it would them a lot of good. They believe what they want to believe, and that leads to lies and and distortions being spread as fact.     I will only add that the quote that started you on search is wrong. I see it all the time - and it is wrong. I wouldn't even mind that much if they didn't try to argue that they have personally investigated the evidence when it is obvious from their own statements that they are scientifically illiterate - and prefer to remain that way.    =====    edit --    Congratulations, this was a great question because the answers (or absence of) proves what every informed person already knows - that facts have the same effect on Creationists that light has on cockroaches.    You know that many more Creation defenders hit on your question than those few that actually responded. There are two possibilities: (1) they actually read the question and did not know what to do or; (2) they went brain-dead and were unable to follow or completely read it.    In either case, the reason clearly is a result of one or a combination of being either: ill-informed; intellectually lazy; or intellectually dishonest.    You know that they immediately ran to a similar but less precisely worded question where they continued their charade of being serious students and intellectual defenders of Creationist belief - and that makes them hypocrites, as well.

JXfGHsF6aa	They have parallel bibles of many versions, including kjv, which is nice to have to compare. I preferably like having a good concordance and a center column cross reference in my kjv red letter edition.    1Co 2:7-13 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.    http://www.rhpa.org/index.php/products/s...|`|e834d8db36b13de567ab48eb9cdaf267aa	There are different approaches used for different translations.    As for Bible versions, there are different levels of accuracy among the translations.    Roughly speaking, some translators try to get an accurate word-for-word translation, some use a thought for thought approach, and some books that call themselves "bibles" are just paraphrases.    The paraphrase will be the least accurate and they may actually contain doctrinal error. These are basically commentaries, more than actual "translations".    Next in accuracy is the thought-for-thought. In these the translators may not try to translate each word accurately, but they try to convey the ideas the text tries to convey. Many of these are pretty accurate as a whole, but the danger is the translators may interject their own bias. Also, if a translator does not correctly understand a passage, then the translation will also reflect that error, sometimes unintentionally. The most popular thought-for-thought translation is the New International Version.    The word-for-word tries to make sure every word is as accurate as possible. In my opinion, this is what you should look for. Let the Word of God speak with accurate words and the "thoughts" will convey what the writer intended.     The best known translation that had this translation aim is the King James Version. The KJV, however, is difficult for some to read because it was translated in 1611 and it uses dialect from that period. Many find the New King James Version slightly more readable. Personally, I prefer the English Standard Version or the New American Standard Bible.    Some people get more than one translation. That way, if you have trouble understanding a verse, another version may be slightly worded another way.|`|AaVfzRamaa	The King James Version is the best but if you buy one published by the LDS (Mormon) church you have a large number of foot notes a topical guide and a Bible dictionary.you read read and or listen to it at www.lds.org under scriptures you can cross reference and it is a great resource.|`|NYGDQ3ezaa	I have a Life Application Study Bible in the New Living Translation (NLT).

Also, you should get lotsa high lighters, that way you always know which verses are your faves! :)  God Bless!|`|AA11551690	I recently purchased a new Bible and did a little research before doing so because I hadn't bought a new Bible in many years.      First, it isn't true that many translations have left out verses, as someone previously stated.      Choose a verse or favorite scripture and read it in various translations and choose one you like best.  There are study Bibles which are helpful in reading and understanding the Bible but can be large and difficult to carry with you.  There are reference Bibles which also help in studying and comparing verses with other verses.  Then there are compact Bibles, easy to carry around.      One way to read translations before you purchase a Bible is to go to biblegateway.com and read scripture in various translations.      Personally, I ended up purchasing a large print, faux leather covered NLT translation.  I like it very much...it's lightweight and the print is good size for my aging eyes.    Good graces on you as you search and God bless you in your reading of His Word.|`|fI263M9eaa	It should have an Official Certificate of Authenticity signed by God herself.  ***ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES! ***|`|RNyEQUQDaa	Iv read the whole Bible, some parts many times (u start with New Test. Bk of John [connects 2 whole Bible] - details below). However, ur approach, methodology, purpose & attitude (in)directly affect what u learn. I use the English Standard Version (ESV) b/c its easier 2 read than many other version while adhering 2 the word 4 word translation method (see below).    In reading the Bible 1 must know this - theres many ways that seem right 2 men but its end = death & verses must b judged with right judgment. The Bible isnt 2 b read as a novel or a bedtime storybook. Many think they can just read it & understand it or its rubbish or pick parts of the Bible not easily understood even by seasoned actual Christians.    No matter how much well-meaning people (religious or not) read the Bible they cant find Jesus Christ without going directly 2 Jesus thru His Biblical instructions (Jn 5:39; 10:1,7; 3:3,5). God outsmarted man - the Bible's the only 1 that cant b properly understood without Jesus (Jn 14:6; II Cor 3:14; Is 29:11-12 - If Jewish people cant pierce the veil over the OT without Jesus then 4 sure all gentiles cant). Thats why theres many interpretations & many thinking its just fairy tales (Jesus came with the sword of division).    The Bible severely warns us not 2 trust humans (including clergy), not even ourselves (Jer 10:2-5,23; Is 2:22; Job 12:11; Prov 14:12; Acts 17:11). So carefully think over what I say. Dont just believe or dismiss what I write so u wont make the mistake many have, getting caught up in religious beliefs that wont lead u 2 God (things written about the Bible r by man not Jesus - like books/commentaries).    Never forget: Neither a label, title, name, its history,   of members, amount of time it existed or whats stated about them means anything - its whats practiced that makes it valid or a lie or not useful (even with respect 2 Bibles). Most Bibles contain the truth but many hv bad errors.    Many miss this - Jesus is the only 1 in history who said He's "the" way, "the" truth & "the" life & NO 1 can know God except thru Jesus (Jn 14:6 - ref Acts 4:12; Jn 5:39; 10:1,7). So "the" whole truth was complete & there4 finished thru what Jesus taught/did or God doesn't know what He's doing & cant be God. The truth is either fully true or its a lie. The full truth cant contain a lie - the absence of any lie. So any so-called new teaching, other religious beliefs or from self-proclaimed prophets & teachers r null & void & cant lead u 2 God. But God always knew what He's doing & all Jesus would do.    Jesus couldnt have done nor said what He did unless He fully knew the entire OT (the NT didnt exist @ the time of Jesus) - only possible if God sent Him & the Apostles couldnt write down the NT unless Jesus allowed them 2 remember & know His purpose (Lk 24:25-27,45). Not possible unless God caused it.    Religions made many fatal errors. They built religions on what man would like God 2 b like. They cant all b right (i.e. Theres 1 Bible, why so many interpretations? - II Pet 1:**19-21). Religion wont teach u much about God (they cant teach what they don't know).    I know many Biblical things but most important is do u know about being Born Anew (Jn 3:3,5)? Whats Biblical is built on it (NT - John is the place 2 start, Chap.3 1rst - the whole Bible is connected 2 John). Im not religious under "church" type labels b/c the Bible is about eternal life not how many rituals u can do (wrong use of the Bible - part of why theres many interpretations). By loving the truth 1rst u'll learn the true love of Jesus Christ.    2 begin 2 find our real Jesus, start with Jn 3:1-14 - note: Nicodemus was very religious but Jesus flatout told him he had missed the 1rst most important step - being Born Anew. 2 be Born Anew u must 1rst understand that no1 can live without breaking God's Law = sin that separates us from God (Rom 3:23; Acts 3:19). There4, u must pray 2 Jesus asking Him 2 forgive ur past sins, accept Jesus Christ as ur 1 & only Savior, ask Him 2 give u God's Holy Spirit (Lk 11:11-13; Jn 15:26; 14:26), seek 2 know & follow Him - u always need a Bible (Jn 7:17; Jn 1:12,13; 3:16,17;21; 36; 5:24: 6:37; 8:12; 10:9; 11:25; 14:6; 20:31; Is 34:16;46:10 - memorize this set of verses - later they helped me).    BIBLES    Use a version that gives 1 the quickest path 2 the truth 4 the best chance not 2 b confused, which u'll hv along the way - especially 4 young people - what u feed children spiritually will affect the outcome - imput = output (Always get a Bible with references 4 related texts). I hv access 2 30+ translations. Iv found the best 2 versions (1 or 2 others r almost as good but not needed). Why I use these 2:    Being wise we know there cant b many versions that can b the best/close 2 the old texts. Theres 3 main types of translations with overlaps/mixtures within each catagory (dependant on agendas or philosophical approach - some may classify some in 1 catagory when they belong in another - especially within B&C below - 2 a degree more than 1 method may b used 4 readability or depending on agendas or theology concepts - some overuse):    A. Word 4 word &/or literal translations  B. Dynamic equivalence or thought 4 thought or overused Literal  C. Concept 4 Concept or paraphrased or overused Literal    1a. Word 4 Word with Literal Trans.    I use Bibles based on "word 4 word" &/or some "literal" translation methods - some literal added 4 easier reading. The reason is they adhere best 2 original text. The translations, best 1rst, r King James III (KJ III) (newest update) by J. P. Green - also published a Literal Translation & an Interlinear Version (IV) - includes Hebrew&Greek, **English Standard Version (ESV) - the "easiest good version" 2 read (a related update of Revised Standard Version (RSV - best older translation), New American Standard Bible (NASB) -|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	Look for one with "LIES" written on the front.

The New World Translation of the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures is a good one.  For one thing, it is an accurate, largely literal translation from the original languages. It is not a loose paraphrase, in which the translators leave out details that they consider unimportant and add ideas that they believe will be helpful. As an aid to students, a number of editions provide extensive footnotes showing variant readings where expressions can legitimately be rendered in more than one way, also a listing of the specific ancient manuscripts on which certain renderings are based.    Some verses may not read the same as what a person is accustomed to. Which rendering is right? Readers are invited to examine manuscript support cited in footnotes of the Reference edition of the New World Translation, read explanations given in the appendix, and compare the rendering with a variety of other translations. They will generally find that some other translators have also seen the need to express the matter in a similar manner.|`|03c287c9e9e2feef723946b70ad122f4aa	Then you have a good one.

LuN1unJ3aa	A lot depends upon how you define "blind" in blind faith. If you are talking about innocence, as in a child's faith, there is nothing wrong with it.     If you are talking about an unwillingness to consider evidence to the contrary of what you believe, that is another matter and is not only blind, but deaf (having no eye to see or ear to hear).    To fully appreciate your own faith / path, you need to see and recognize other points of view and appreciate what they can add to your own.|`|eomrfXrzaa	The blind part.  Refusal to accept that the horrendously outdated worldview of the bronze age is wrong is what leads to all the religious nonsense in the world.  Those with blind faith reject blatantly obvious scientific theory, and theory in science does not mean crazy idea, it means something that has been intensively tested and produced confirmative results every single time.  It is as close to proven as scientists allow; there is no such thing as "truth" in science)    "Blind faith" causes people to see themselves as right and everyone else is wrong just because I said so.  This raw arrogance leads to contempt of "infidels", which leads to hatred, which leads to genocide.  This has happened with every single theocratic nation since the beginning of civilization.  Blind faith inhibits real progress, it prevents mankind from achieving its true potential.  It hasn't been prayer or faith that has made the common man of today live better than the richest kings of the bronze age could ever have dreamed of; it's science and reason.  Rejecting logic and science in favor of a 2,000 year book that is magical just because it is is the single worst thing a person could ever do.|`|ncXMA6rsaa	Nothing, as long as it doesn't interfere with anyone else's life.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	nothing but we wont remain blind when we repent..|`|AA12059478	Two words:  Heaven's Gate.

Not blind.|`|9Dq2176oaa	To believe  requires faith. The Bible states that without faith it is impossible to please [God] well, for he that approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him. (Heb. 11:6) Blind faith is of no value. But faith based on evidence can give solid hope. God has provided us ample evidence to believe, not only that he exists, but that he is the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him. Consider what he has already done in the past as evidence of his care and concern for the good of mankind|`|2d3c0dd80f2737f4fd6ec8f62b612c70aa	There are too many religious people who become religious precisely to avoid having to think, writes the dean of a theological seminary in the United States. They simply want to accept everything on faith, he added.  The implication is that most people who profess religious faith give little thought to why they believe what they do or to whether there is a reasonable basis for their faith.     Does it not strike you as odd that the person who does extensive research just to buy a carwhich one day will end up on the scrap heapwould say regarding his religion, If it was good enough for my parents, its good enough for me?  If we are truly interested in pleasing God, should we not consider seriously the accuracy of what we believe about him?   a hired painter who works hard to paint a house but uses the wrong colors because he fails to listen to the owners instructions. The painter may be pleased with his work, but would it be acceptable to the owner?  Real faith is to be obtained only through diligent study of Gods Word, the Bible. www.watchtower.org|`|e834d8db36b13de567ab48eb9cdaf267aa	It is not the type of faith described in the Bible!  (Acts 17:11, Romans 10:17)    "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world."    (1 John 4:1)    "For he vigorously refuted the Jews in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ."  (Acts 18:28)    Notice the evidence the apostles gave in Acts 2, the beginning of the church.   They showed what David said, and what Joel said in the scriptures about the coming Christ.  They spoke of the miracles that were done that the people had seen and knew about firsthand and they spoke of witnesses of the resurrection of Christ.    After all of this evidence, the people were told, Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ." (Acts 2:36)    Notice the evidence Paul gave in 1 Corinthians 15:1-8.    Paul listed the witnesses of Christs resurrection.    There was Peter, then the apostles, then over 500 at one time.  Most of those witnesses were still around.  These people probably knew them and could ask them about what they had seen.  Finally, Paul added himself to the list of witnesses.    Faith is not credulity!
T52vXXBJaa	Because testimonials and anecdote appeal more to the uneducated masses than facts or research. The power of a Ph.D. - even in an unrelated field - lends strength to the position in the minds of those whose opinions are supported by the list.

It's also because they can't get the signatures of those Ph.D.s in the relevant fields because these people know better than to attach their name to something this silly.|`|qnt1wAfiaa	People LOVE to find reasons to believe.

I believe the consensus here was thet she was incredibly rude and had no right to go into someone else's home and "demand" anything.  She even mentioned that there were closed doors and that she wanted to know what was behind those doors.  What a nutcase!  Is that the same person? Or maybe YOU are that woman?|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	STop being a wuss and just say no.  It's your home and you don't have to show it to anyone without a warrant.  You already know this person is nosy and she's going to want to get into everything so be prepared.  When she says she wants to see the rest of the house, just say no, we like to keep our private areas private.  And keep your personal things like your purse tucked away when she's around.  Never leave her alone in your home or your private area (office or car or whatever) unless you're willing to let her snoop.  You know what kind of person you are dealing with; just don't let her have her way.  She'll get mad but she won't die from being denied.  And if you cannot trust her to respect your privacy at home, don't invite her into your home, just tell her you would invite her in but she doesn't respect you or your family so she can't come in.|`|rcCYssKYaa	Nosy!!!

I personally wouldn't be intimidated into allowing someone I didn't know well into my home -- and my bedroom is off-limits to casual acquaintances -- close friends and lovers only!

bRoFUcIgaa	I'm from Canada but it's not a big deal at all, well I mean- it *is* a big deal in the long run as your grades will suffer but people skip all the time. Usually there will be no punishment- as you will just be marked as an unexcused absence in the class which you aren't attending.   If you are caught in the school while you should be in a class, they'll just tell you to go to class. In junior high (7-9 at my school) you would be given a warning if caught first time around, and then the next time you'd be sent to the office and given a detention possibly- if they keep catching you then you could get an "in-school suspension" which is when you spend the day at the office, lol.  But in senior high (10-12 at my school), they don't care... like I said... they'll tell you to go to class and that's about it. I mean, it's basically *your choice* if you want to graduate hey?!? And there isn't much they can do to get you to go to class if you refuse... your parents can get mad at you all they want because there the ones paying for you to be there!!!|`|AA10064810	It is a stupid waste of time and money.  In the olden days, I could have been expelled from Purdue University for having 3 unexcused absences total for all my courses.  Why get into a project, class, etc. and then cut yourself off from whatever benefit it offers, even if it is only a passing grade?  One consequence is that the instructor will not look favorably on any problem you have meeting a deadline because you show no interest in fulfilling the most basic requirement of the class, actually being there. I've known of students who were between a D and an F being given the D because of attitude and attendance.|`|lwG6tvOqaa	It depends on what kind of school you go to, and where it is located.    Most school will give you detention/ discipline referral/ phone call home if you are caught skipping class, but for repeat offenders, you could get suspened/in-school suspension/out of school suspension.    The adults don't like it when kids skip school, because it usually increases their chances of getting in trouble, which is never a good thing.|`|cnulCeFaaa	Not at all. People do it all the time now.|`|YdjX5fOWaa	It depends on the school and of course if you get caught. But I know when I was in school it was a big deal if you got caught.

Can you look in the mirror and be thrilled with what you see? Can you dissect your self and admit who you are, accept your flaws, and be thrilled with who you are? When you walk down the street and men ogle you do you think they are dreaming coz you are just a little to good for them?  I am 37, and have all of this, I know who I am, my flaws and great attributes , I love my body, soul and mind and I would not trade places with anyone. I have no kids never be married and adore being single. I love my life and me, and I am blissful. When you can love and accept you like this you will feel fulfilled. So start writing it down and bury what you don't want then make yourself who you want to be. Then you will feel joyous.

I was thrilled to death with the birth of my children, and loved every minute of raising them, but I always had that uneasy, disatisfied feeling.  Is there something wrong with me?  Why am I not like everyone else?  What is God's plan for me?  What am I doing wrong?  What do I need to do to feel "normal", as if I belong, as if I'm fulfilling some sort of destiny.  Now that I'm getting close to 60, I'm not sure I ever found the answer to any of those questions, it's more like I don't have those questions any more.  My children are grown and are healthy and happy; that gives me a lot of peace and satisfaciton.  I remarried - the man of my dreams!!! - and am so happy with this relationship and life.  I have awesome grandkids that I adore.  I enjoy my career, but it is also very stressful, and now I see that I am nearing retirement age and a relief from all those challenges.  Why am I so happy and relaxed now?  Is it because I've finally achieved what I wanted to, and have a more secure and happy lifestyle?  Is it because I'm getting older and more burned out, and have given up on a lot of idealistic dreams?  It's hard to say.  I just have a feeling that you have these uneasy moments because you are also idealistic, that you have high hopes and expectations, and this is a crazy world where the best laid plans can go awry.  I do know that I felt God was not listening to me and not answering me, but now I think He was doing the best He could to get His message across.  He did answer my prayers in a very big way when I asked him to send me a GOOD man - and I've been married to that wonderful man for 12 years.  We're having a wonderful time!  But you know, I'm sure many tough times lie ahead - that's the nature of life.  Probably none of us will ever have that feeling of 100% ease and satisfaction - just be ready to see all the good times God has in store for you, and try to understand the trials that He send as your opportunity to grow.|`|IWyrJ7o3aa	I agree with Jackie Blue and you know none of us are happy all the time, and no one can make you happy but yourself.

Contentment and being fulfilled is a state of mind and it does not rest on fame or fortune. I found it when I began taking everything to God in prayer and when I started learning just how wonderful and very subtle God speaks with me. Now I hear him when the Mourning Doves coo and the Bobwhite Quail calls, when the doe, with her fawn see's me and sneaks away, when the Roadrunner looks at me and wonders what I am doing in his domain, when the Mocking Bird sings in the moonlight and when I just take the time to slow down and listen and look.  Seek and you will find. Knock and it will be opened unto you. That is what I had to do.|`|xyt9NdjVaa	God answers us, it just isn't the answer we always expect. Sometimes there are lessons to be learned. Believe me, I do understand where you are coming from. I was there. A time when raising a family and life was good. I've got blessings too, I sometimes forget to just stop and think about them. I have found that when times are as the way you describe, though you say you talk to God, it does help to get into His Word. Some of the most serene and contented times in my life was when daily reading was a part of my life. It got me through the times when I didn't know what was wrong. I think as we age we sometimes began to reflect and think about the what ifs and could be's, but do stop and count your blessings. Perhaps there is someone out there that is in need of a friend as yourself. You never know, be receptive to others around you, and don't close yourself off to something new, and you might just find something that will fulfill you. God does answer, just be patient. He is in control, if you will allow Him to lead you.|`|YTasscmKaa	Deep down you know what you're missing. Think on it. Decide what it is and make a plan to get it.

lh8Tn02Naa	I don't find it strange, but I don't like what it says about the people who actually want to believe in deities like these.    Men have this stuff called testosterone sloshing around inside them.  We need it to stay male I guess, but it doesn't half cause some problems.  It not only makes us violent, we actually get off on violence.  Usually, thank the Lord, at the level of fantasy.    But these pictures of God are testosterone-fuelled projections, invented by men (and I mean men, very much as opposed to women) on the basis that to be divine is to be just like a man - therefore violent and aggressive - only more so.    Since we have come to understand the role of psychology in the way we portray God to ourselves, we now distance ourselves from these kind of images.  I'm not saying there's no God; I'm saying we need to be very clear that he is not to be identified with our pictures of him, especially when they are as bloodthirsty as this.    Check out Exodus 32: 25-29.  The numbers killed aren't as high in your examples, but the morality of this passage is simply unbelievable.|`|xmnlLubzaa	Because of Cthulu!!!

Priests and tribal eldars did much the same thing when they invented their god-stories, and religions around their gods.  The Bible is part myth, part fairy tale, and part history book.  Your job is to figure out which parts are which, and you seem to have a good start on the whole problem.    Its like film, television and video games today - the make believe violence often produces real violence in the more troubled members of the audience.|`|dz5Og81Qaa	This just shows how much the Bible is a collection of men's perceptions about what they think divinity is. The Bible is definitely NOT the Word of God.    No matter how inspired the authors were or by what source, the information had to filter through their minds and personalities. The Bible was written by men immersed in an ancient patriarchal culture. They all had agendas, whether it was keeping the social order, unifying doctrine, eliminating heresy or gaining converts. For me, it's a pretty transparent piece of propaganda.    What I do value in the Bible is the story of Christ's life and teachings. I think He knew how misinterpreted and manipulated words can become and therefore lived in a way that would allow us to follow in His footsteps regardless of what anyone wrote about Him.

1c25f0773926f8cde3f71d5867bbbc1eaa	It appears that the orginal cause for excommuncation of Richard Williamson has nothing to do with his views of the Holocaust. He was excommunicated along with 3 other bishops for their "schismatic" views, and specifically for having been made bishops by archbishop Marcel Lefebvre in the 1970s in an unsanctioned consecration. These men resisted the "liberalization" of the Catholic Church in the 60s and 70s. The current Pope Benedict XVI is trying to mend fences with the ultaconservative branch of the Catholic Church, but the price he is paying is appearing to turn a deaf ear to the anguished Germans and Jews upset over William's views of the Holocaust. The real question is, should Pope Benedict XVI then excommunicate William for the separate charge of his denial of the Holocaust? It is very doubtful that the pope would ever do that, no matter how strongly the Germans or the Jews (or anyone else for that matter) feels about it. This is all internal church politics.     Is it a mistake? Yes, I think so. It makes the church look out of touch with the world today.  However, the Catholic Church has always had the attitude that they've been around for 2,000 years, regardless of what the rest of the world thinks of it, so to them it's just tempest in a teapot.|`|GW8LVWT8aa	He singlehandedly made Roman Catholicism a laughing stock.

It is sad that the most minuscule thing that anyone can in a round about way tie anywhere to the Pope and it becomes and automatic Statement from the Pope himself.    I say, grow up.    Peace!|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	The Pope does not deny that the Holocaust happened. He has written and spoken about that tragedy numerous times.    The Pope has been trying to rehabilitate a wayward bishop who at one time believed that the Holocaust was faked. I do not know if that man has changed his position or not, but one would think he's on a firmer place of reality or the Pope would not have rescinded the guy's excommunication.     We might try waiting for facts instead of relying on conjecture.    EDITED TO ADD:    Here it is -- this bishop will NOT be received into full communion until he rejects his previous position about the Holocaust.     http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories...|`|AA11440601	These "bishops" were excommunicated for being ordained as bishops without the Pope's permission which is against both Church Tradition and Church Law.    It is well within the Pope's rights to reconcile with these men if that is what he wishes. Let's hope that these repentant men will lead the SSPX into rightful Church Tradition.    This action just lets these penitent men receive the sacraments. It does not let them act as bishops nor does it have anything to do with their personal opinions about the Shoah or any other issue.    Fortunately or unfortunately, the Catholic Church does not excommunicate people because they are mistaken about history.    Remember the purpose of excommunication is the correction and redemption of the person who has chosen to separate himself or herself from the Church.

It seems to me that the devil is attacking you and causing this anxiety.  He wouldn't bother if he already had your soul.  You backslid.  You confessed your sin to God and asked His forgiveness.  He forgave you.  Now you have to step out in faith.  Read your Bible daily, especially the New Testament.  As you get to know Jesus better, your fears will subside.  Join a good Bible-believing church.  If you can't find one where you live, move to where there is one.  It's very important to have the fellowship and support of other Christians.   Pray before you start your day.  Just  talk to the Lord about everything that's on your mind.  Set your clock a half hour early in the morning if you have to.  It's very important to pray and read the Bible.  God speaks to us through His holy word.  He will guide your life through His Word.  Get involved with a church ministry.  Serve God.    Look up Philippians 4:6-8.  Also, John 1:12, Romans 10:13, 1 John 12,13; 1 Corinthians 15:1-5; Proverbs 3:5,6; Romans 3:23, Romans 6:23, Romans 5:8, John 3:16, 1 John 1:9.

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13).  :)    The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

DfDss68haa	People are ignorant. And they truly believe their hair is "bad". It's just jealousy and insecurity on their parts. They are mad becuase they truly believe they need weave and relaxers. It's also ignorance becuase many people straight out of Africa have a looser texture. Go to http://nappturality.com. They have forums just on this topic. Also go to the below websites (I highly recommend http://naturallycurly.com) if you are interested in managing your curls. You don't have to flat iron your hair.  Heat damage is real:  http://rockyournatural.blogspot.com/2008...    The best thing about going natural myself is that I don't have to look at your hair and feel bad about my own hair even though it's what is called "bad" hair. Unfortunately until we rid the black community of this idea that hair can be good or bad you are always going to have people insisting that you are mixed and commenting on your hair. I am glad you have not bought into the whole "good hair bad hair thing".     Next time someone asks if you are mixed, just say "Yes, I am mixed with black and blacker."    And the next time someone tells you you have good hair call them on it. Ask them "What makes hair good? Does it sing you to sleep at night? What makes hair bad, does it sneak off at night to rob banks?" lol    Also you should check out Chris Rock's new documentary coming out on this subject called Good Hair addressing this nonsense.

SsSIbFhcaa	Man it is easy to see how ignorant people are about what is going on in the world.    1st: While Britain is not a Muslim nation they have adopted Sharia Law for any Muslim practicing citizen.    ISLAMIC law has been officially adopted in Britain, with sharia courts given powers to rule on Muslim civil cases    http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk...    2nd: Britain does allow a Muslim to have multiple wives. The crux is you can't marry them in the UK, to be allowed the extra marriages must be done outside of the UK.    Even though bigamy is a crime in Britain, the decision by ministers means that polygamous marriages can now be recognized formally by the state, so long as the weddings took place in countries where the arrangement is legal.    http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopi...    So those who say Muslim Law is not permitted in the UK are ignorant as well as those who say you can not have multiple wives in the UK.    edit  Oh and I live in the US and know about this because I pay attention. What is the excuse of all the others?    edit  People can thumbs down me all they want, the fact is it is happening and you have your heads in the sand about it.|`|Fm5YsQnfaa	We do not change our laws to suit the minority of people who choose to live here.    You can take a hundred wives in your faith, marry them in accordance to your religious laws and they can all live with you in the UK. However you can only have the one legal wife at a time.     Most people in the UK do not bother with marriage any more any way.|`|ncXMA6rsaa	Because having more than one wife is sexist and patriarchal in nature. We find that OFFENSIVE over here. Why do you need more than one wife?! What is wrong with you people!|`|D1BNSf5uaa	Marriage regonized by law has nothing to do with religion. It existed before. If you want to marry more than one woman, move to freaking Saudi Arabia. If you move to the UK, expect to adapt to its customs.|`|TPPZp8IYaa	Because in Western Society it is against the law...|`|WF085j2Daa	If you dont like the rules go back to your mud hut and total lack of medical or sanitation facilities|`|6296beaabcf8f4682bfa047d500f8e9aaa	The UK has many laws that violate common sense never mind other peoples religious freedom.    You have 2 options, move somewhere with a set of laws you agree with or stay here and try to have the laws changed to something more accommodating to your beliefs.    I think if you're crazy enough to want more than one mother-in-law then you should be allowed to, but most of the rest of the UK are Christian in some form and are against polygamy.    Of course, should you want to change the law to favour your religion it will often impact other peoples rights to practise their beliefs.  If a more Muslim view was taken by the courts then gay people would be in trouble, adultery would be a criminal offence, the currently unused blasphemy law would come back into use.  All of these are bad things to people who live in a free and just (kind of) society.    So while in this case I totally agree with you, how much freedom do you want the people of the UK to sacrifice to accommodate any other beliefs you wish to be allowed?  Should stoning be a punishment for certain crimes?  Should women be forced (they should always be allowed to if they choose to) to cover up?  Should someone showing or creating a picture of the Prophet be killed?  These are the issues that would be raised and lead to outrage among otherwise moderate people.    I forgot to mention this before, but the vast majority of cultures that have existed on earth (that we know of) have permitted polygamy, link below.  "According to the Ethnographic Atlas Codebook, of the 1231 societies noted, 186 were monogamous. 453 had occasional polygyny, 588 had more frequent polygyny, and 4 had polyandry."|`|AA11264399	Because that's bigamy and it's illegal.|`|o9cAl8xhaa	Because the UK is a Christian Kingdom.|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	It just is, it is for legal issues and has nothing to do with your religion.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	Because the UK operates under British, not Sharia, law.

You can't expect freedom to live like you want in our lands while not giving us the same freedom in your lands.|`|9d43ec02a222734089d9cf48ceafea47aa	what? you want lots of wives  but you cant handle it when your girlfriend of 1 year cheats on you.   tut tut. i read your profile.|`|nHizaTiDaa	This is why I argue against "tolerate everything".       If we don't all have a "baseline" or something in common to base our standards on- everything goes.    Wake up people.  If you want to remain free.  We DO NOT have to tolerate everything.

While I don't agree with that lifestyle, I believe that freedom of religion includes freedom of ALL religions. It isn't right that our countries' laws are at least partially still based on Christian values.     It may hearten you to know that some of us are dedicating our lives to stopping that.|`|o8PFZZi3aa	Take the hint and go back to the emirates.|`|gOKi1dcVaa	Why don't you return to your country of origin and have multiple wives there?|`|0828da5af665965d93cec715ea16e810aa	Because that's the law.

Make sure you know them all, go talk to an imam before you marry someone else. - You have to treat all of them equally - can you do that? Most people can't... It's not all about financial support.   Plus islamicially 100 wives is wrong.     Anyways, Islamically you can marry someone else without it being an official UK marriage.Talk to your imam.    EDIT:   Out of pure intrest could you actually find a 2nd wife? Women genrally dont take to kindly to this.. Especially if there from the UK and are use to this sort of lifestyle.. And what would your current wife say? (Assuming your married right now..)|`|V6GI0m8Caa	I'm sorry this is a ridiculous question, which i am sure you can work out for yourself!  Britain is a christian country, with christian beliefs    We don't come over to your country asking you to change your laws and beliefs.  We don't believe in marrying more than one person for a reason.  It's a self indulging, sexist act that quite frankly sickens me.    I don't care if you have enough money to support 2 billion wives, how insignificant do you want to make each wife of yours feel?  Marriage is a special, once in a life time thing - not something which is meant to happen every other day!!    Why do you need more than one wife?  That should be the question you are asking my friend.|`|AA10105819	The U.K. isn't a Muslim kingdom, so don't expect Sharia to be the norm. You went there voluntarily, so expect to abide by the rules. If you want more than one wife, then yes, go to the Emirates (or any Muslim country). Marry someone in the Emirates and bring her back to the U.K. if you want to continue your life there.    Sometimes, you can't have your cake and eat it too. Make a decision with what you have instead of complaining. They're not Muslim, so they don't have to adopt Muslim laws.    EDIT: You and Tim A can have a "bromance" lol!

Religion doesn't have an exclusive claim to that belief.  And you're employing the same empty-headed fallacy that all of your "believer" brethren seem to do: Insisting that if people can't prove your god doesn't exist, it somehow proves he does. You can't prove that Bigfoot, leprechauns, fairies and unicorns don't exist, either - that doesn't mean that they do.|`|a2c597f938ef5660383e867387c501a6aa	This is a difficult question to answer as there hasn't been much study on the decomposition of human remains. The field is growing, but much is yet to be learned about what happens to human remains after death.    If you are speaking of consciousness, then that is a question that only philosophers of religious doctrine attempt to answer, even if they don't call their religion by a name you might recognize. There is a certain degree of superstition or suspension of disbelief necessary to imagine a consciousness that survives a corporeal existence. Those who do not indulge in superstitious thinking must rely on reality.     Reality states that death is the end of consciousness. I've yet to meet a discorporeal consciousness, so I must surmise that there is no "afterlife".|`|QusqTXCaaa	Well, if I die with a sword in my hand, after living a good and heroic life.  I will be guided to the drinking halls of Odin by the Valkyrie, and then I will feast and fight and, er copulate until the coming of Ragnorokr, which will happen after three years of winter "Fimbuveltr", then Skoll will devour the Sun, Hati will devour the Moon, three Cockerels will call to the ?sir, the giants, and the dead.    Terrible Earthquakes will release the terrible wolf Fenris, his lower jaw will scrape the ground, his upper jaw will scrape the sky.  Narglfar, the ship of the dead, made from dead mans finger nails will set sail.    Gods, Giants, Dwarves, Daemons and Elves will ride to Vigrid were the final battle will be fought.  Thor and Jormungand will kill each other, Fenris will swallow Odin, and Vidar will kill Fenris.    Then the nine Worlds will burn in the fire of Surt.  But a new Earth will rise, an idyllic world where wickedness and misery will not exist, this world will be populated by the descendants of Lif and Lifhrasir.    Now, this is a rough description of the apocalypse of Germanic paganism.  Its what the pre Christian Scandinavians, English and Germans believed.      I don't believe it any more than you do.  But its only as valid as your talk of God and an afterlife.  How many other religions and beliefs do you emphatically reject?    What inside information do you have that every belief that you don't have is false?    I accept or reject beliefs on what can be proven, not on what can't be proven.

There is also scientific evidence that explains the "near death experience" (tunnel, white light, etc.) neurologically.|`|v7Wflu78aa	One method, and it's a very good method, of getting close to the truth is making hypotheses that can be tested, and then test them.  Then, get other people to test them, and get other people to see how YOU tested them and interpreted the answers.    However, you have to accept that a better test or better hypothesis can replace the one that you proved.    We call the creation, testing, and confirming/rejecting of hypotheses "science."  There is no place for magic, i.e., non-natural, causes.    Water will boil NOT when a genie says "BOIL", but when the pressure and heat combined can vaporize water, which then bubbles up through the rest of the water.  You can test this by increasing, decreasing heat and or pressure.  You can't test whether or not a genie said "BOIL."    So it is with death.    One hypotheses is that when life processes stop, there is no more life.    I've seen dead animals, and they don't seem to have any life.  They get poked, run-over, burned - but they don't breath, show thought processes, produce new flowers, lay eggs, or whatever.    So, given all the actual evidence that when things die, they are no longer alive, I am pretty convinced.    BUT... In the absence of knowledge, humans make stuff up.  The best we can do when we suspect something is made up is think of the fiction as a hypothesis, and come up with some tests.    For example, "Drugs will kill you," is a hypothesis.    You then smoke pot, snort cocaine and you are still alive.    But, your best friend died of a heroin overdose.    You might restate your hypothesis, "Some drugs kill, if taken in large enough quantities."    The same with death.    "After death,  such and such happens."    Well, test the hypothesis.  Let us know when you get the results.

I mean if you just got your degree, it's okay to brag. Although, informing, updating someone should never turn into "bragging".  It's not okay to be consumed by showing off. Dominating and interrupting every conversation with an endless list of how or what you've accomplished is not cool either.  Accomplishments, things that you worked your *** for are worthy of bragging.

7q9MN1Wkaa	I LOVE Asian guys!! My BF is Chinese, I'm white. I've dated slightly more Asians than whites. But I think I'm still in the minority in the US. It's changing, tho. I see more & more Asian guy/ White girl couples.    I think most Asian guys are just too intimidated by white women.  They are just chicks!  Ask the out.  Trust me, they would be flattered.  Even if an ugly guy (or someone I wasn't attracted to at all) asked me out, I would be flattered.  Just go for it.    I found that Asian guys are less "proactive" when it comes to dating.  Sometimes I have to do the work!  But it paid off.  My BF is HOT!|`|uQfJukisaa	I love asian guys. I have actually dated 2 asian guys.

I think that everyone has their opinions of what they like..|`|CaogIDbXaa	True love is blind.    Race, looks, height, and size doesn't matter. Sure there are those who will tell you that they do matter, but those things are just superficial and the icing on the cake. What matters most is the other person's personality, intelligence, etc.    Each person has this idea of the perfect companion that would make them weak in the knees and go gaga over that person. While it is not really discrimination when it comes to dating, it is personal preference, although I feel that people should not limit themselves to just their "ideal image" in what they think is perfection in their second half. It is their loss if they refuse to look past cultural differences and possibly finding true happiness or love with the person that "doesn't fit" their illusions.    The ones who refuse to look outside the box are closed minded and not worth the time or effort to try to get them to go out with you. If they refuse to be open to new things, then you are better off trying to find someone who will be more open and receptive to the type of person you are and not look at what your cultural background is.|`|5O4YvRiKaa	Asian guys are hot.|`|RDdhVnksaa	Your a nerd.. I see alot of asian men with other races, its probably just your game>|`|C85USMF0aa	Well, I'm caucasian, I live in Europe and I don't think that Asian guys are ugly or something like that. Not at all.    Okay, first of all, the problem is that Korean, Chinese,Japanese and most of the asian people have almond shaped eyes, and a specific shape of their nose, mouth, etc., People tend to call an Asian person "Chinese", because they are the most spread in the world. Another reason for them to do this is that they are not aware of the specific details of their appearance, and every asian person looks the same for them.      People in my country don't know how to make the difference between a Korean or a Japanese guy or girl because they REALLY lack information.     I've studied Japan's, Korea's and China's cultures and societies and now i can tell which is which.     I don't really know why they call you like that, since they're asian too... I don't get it. *straight face*    About your attraction for Latin women...Well, you asian people are very cold comparing to us, the Latins. You don't express your feelings too much, especially while walking on the street, you're very calculate. A Latin girl will give you a passionate french kiss even if you're in the middle of the street and all the people around you are watching. She'd hug you, she'd scream that she loves you.  Another reason for the Asian guys to like us is that we're not so "icy" like Asian women are. We're able to start a conversation with a guy in a matter of seconds.     You'd rather be attracted by a Latin girl because she' s more curvaceous, she has a nice body, boobs etc. I'm not saying that every Latin woman is like that, you'll find some that don't look so good, but generally, Latin girls have a nice body built.     Some girls prefer an Asian guy over a caucasian one, although it's a small percent.    Why aren't Asian men so popular with girls?  Don't know, but I've heard that (hey, no offence, it's just a rumor) they don't satisfy them in their sexual intercourses. I repeat, it's not my opinion, i just heard it.    Why would they choose a boyfriend whose income is over $250,000?!  God, this must be a mistake. I mean, what percent of the Asian guys have this money?   And the rest of the guys are left alone?   Nope, it's a mistake. I think every Asian guy can meet a cute Asian girl and get along with each other and stuff like that.     I hope it will help you. Theese are just my thoughts, don't take them as a general opinion. :)      P.S. I wrote so much! It looks like my diary!|`|nuUsNzj7aa	you obviously is a white guy in disguise.  You know what your motive of asking this question is.|`|lv9ahVwgaa	After I had an asian boyfriend I don't want anybody else. I'm wondering what asian guys who never dated latina think about us ?
216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	First of all, one should choose that ring which suits the style and persona of your lover. It should have the capability of adding charisma to her personality. You can also choose the engagement ring, depending upon the fact, whether she is a housewife or goes regularly to office.    The second most important thing which should be kept in mind while buying engagement ring is the quality of stone. If we speak about diamond engagement rings, which also are the most favorite of women, while buying it, one should concentrate on the 4 Cs of diamond. The 4 Cs include color, clarity, cut and carat. Colorless diamond stone are considered the purest form of diamond. But many of us do not know that diamonds come in many other colors. Some of the most adorable colors in which we can find diamonds are pink and blue. Many celebrities have been flaunting colored diamonds in the past.    The next most important aspect to be kept in mind while buying engagement rings is your budget. You can go for designer engagement rings, if you have a big budget. Then there is no limit. But if you have a defined budget, then you have to think twice before buying the ring. You need to buy the best at minimum cost.     Buying an engagement ring should not be a part of a hasty decision. Choose from as many options available. It is a time consuming process, but after all it is worth the time.     But still if you fall short of time, you can book an engagement ring online, let it be diamond engagement rings, vintage engagement ring, designer engagement ring, discount engagement ring or customized engagement ring. Avail all the offers that come your way. So what are you waiting for, order your favorite diamond engagement ring today.    nfd?

IZJYCYkoaa	No, It's not correct.   Christ established His Church on the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets. Himself being the chief corner stone (Eph 2:20, 1 Cor. 4:15). He appointed Peter as the leader taking into consideration his "more love" (Jn 21 :15?17) or "more faith" (Mt. 16:13-20). As the tiny mustard seed becomes a huge tree (Mt. 13:31) and a small quantity of leaven leavens the whole measure of flour, the Church inaugurated by Jesus with a small band of Apostles became a big organization in course of time.   All throughout the centuries it remained God's Church due to his continuous presence in the Church (Mt. 28:20) and the work of the Holy Spirit (Acts. 2:4). Even from the early days, it was called God's Church (Acts 9:5).   After his conversion, St Paul indicts himself, "For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it (Gal. 1:13).   The Apostolic tradition of this "God's Church" is rightly claimed by the Catholic Church.   Even Paul, the greatest missionary had often recourse to the Apostolic authority to establish the veracity of his teaching (Gal. 2:2). However, some people nowadays teach different doctrines and run the risk of ruin.|`|vAbATcTcaa	Jesus said "I will build my church" He said that to st. Peter.

Jesus established His church, the one and only Catholic church on the firm foundation, Peter the first Pope.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	Incorrect.      It's clearly in the bible that Jesus said he was establishing his Church and Peter was the first leader of it.  The church is clearly apostolic (meaning it didn't end with the disciples), just read Acts, and early church writings (there is a history of the church that shouldn't be ignored)-- note:  Jesus is the Rock, but Simon (who's name is changed to Peter) is elevated to be 'a rock', indicating the establishment of a covenant with God (Abrams name was changed to Abraham when God established the first covenant with him.).  Not to mention the transference of 'keys' which are a symbol of power and authority.    Jesus also promised that not even the powers (gates) of Hades (death) would prevail against it, meaning it would remain here on earth until he returned.    After he left He sent the Holy Spirit to the Church, because he also promised he would not leave us orphaned.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	There is a Church (the Catholic ) that says that Jesus established it.     I am a Catholic. You have to answer for you on that topic.|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	Paul established the first church, Christ had already died.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	The Bible says that the church is the physical bodies of saved believers in Jesus.  That's what Jesus established.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	Ephesians 4:5.  |`|XsTJPMHqaa	That is not correct. Scripture clearly states that Christ said to Simon, who became Peter, which means "Rock" "Thou art Rock, and upon this rock I shall build my Church".    Notice He specifically says "My Church" implying that there is just one that belongs to Him. Not "Churches". Furthermore, that Church was established on St. Peter.    There's a reason the Pope is called "The Successor of St. Peter" or it is said he "sits on the throne of St. Peter". St. Peter was martryd in Rome, and ever since the Bishop of Rome has been the Pope who leads the Church on Earth.|`|93galWG1aa	He did and it was on Peter he built it.|`|9mLOH7bpaa	Christ was a Jew. It would have been a synagogue.|`|Dh8i9msPaa	A body of believers is a church, not the building.|`|SsSIbFhcaa	Jesus established the church.    When he asked the disciples who he was there were several answers but Peter said you are the Christ (messiah). Jesus said upon that truth would the church be established. Matthew 16:18    He also directed the disciples to go into all the world teaching, preaching and baptizing in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (Trinity, notice it says Name not Names). This is called the Great Commission, the direction to establish the church.    So those who claim that Christ never direct it to be established are wrong, the bible shows it. People who say Paul established and create it are wrong since Paul was not at this time a disciple of Christ, that happened after Christ died and rose again.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	The church was founded over one hundred years after Jesus. The Roman Catholic Church was established by combining christianity with all the pagan Roman beliefs to please the Roman Patricians and the Emperor and still appeal to the plebeians and slaves. Jesus would not have recognized 'his' religion, had he lived.|`|DCe7GVJAaa	yes.his deciples established church|`|e834d8db36b13de567ab48eb9cdaf267aa	Jesus established His church. (Matthew 16:18)    He did so by the things he taught and instructed.  The apostles in turn were to go into the world and teach others to observe the things Christ had instructed them. (Matthew 28:18-20)    That church will exist until Christ returns.    How do you identify and recognize this church?  Look into, diligently and honestly study the Bible.  Look at the pattern that was taught there.  Compare doctrine to the scriptures to see if it is true. (Acts 17:11)    Any church that claims to follow Christ should not object to such a comparison to scripture!  In fact, they should encourage it!  The scriptures are useful for our doctrine, teaching, to correct error, and to reprove (check to be sure they are on the right path). (2 Timothy 3:16-17)    When you find the church that worships the way the original church did, teaches what the original church did, is organized the way the original church was organized, and does what the original church did, then you have found the original church that was established by Christ.    The church should speak where the Bible speaks, be silent where the Bible is silent, do Bible things in Bible ways, and call Bible things by Bible names.|`|VvZPM6Yyaa	well christ had made prayer areas not non as church   but later known as church and im put u back in contacts      : )|`|1lRlNIelaa	It is. Unless you view the Disciples as a Church which they were not. He was a teacher and he had students. Those students (namely Paul and Peter) founded the actual Church but since Jesus taught the ideas and all in this religion it is logical to call him the origin or head or creator of the idea while the Disciples were the "physical" founders.

bda465ikaa	King John and his subjects lived in a feudal society. In accordance with feudal custom the king granted barons land in return for an oath of loyalty, obedience, and military service. The barons provided knights for the king's military whenever required instead of paying rent to the king. Barons received control over their land but it was still owned by the king. In turn, the barons granted smaller parcels of their land to individuals chosen to serve as knights. This arrangement was known as holding land "in fee" from the king. For their loyalty, the king was obliged to treat his barons and knights with fairness and respect.    In addition to military service, a king was allowed to charge and collect a variety of taxes or fees from barons to support the crown. Customary fees included reliefs, aids, scutage, and county court fines. Reliefs were collected when a baron died and the baron's heir inherited the baron's land and other property. If the heir was underage, the king could take guardianship over the land and all of its profits. The king could sell the guardianship to anyone who could pay the worth of the land. When the heir came of age, he had to pay a relief to get his land back. The king also had the right to sell widows and daughters into marriage for the price of the land.
