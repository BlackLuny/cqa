20090310031458AAVD8kl	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Quick growing grass in Hawaii?	Most companies online don't ship to Hawaii. Does anyone have an advice for what kind of grass would be quick growing and quite hardy? I have two dogs and the grass we currently have lays flat but it like a 6 inch vine of grass, it's odd and not nice to walk on at all! Any advice? I'd like to have a nice lawn. The dogs don't really destroy the grass it's just kind of bad grass to begin with.       I don't mind watering and am home often, we have lots of red dirt and the current grass doesn't stand up to rain and gets VERY muddy.      Sorry for rambling but any advice would be GREAT!

20090310033443AAyDiJ1	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Am I allowed to show a picture of my non-existent garden for landscaping advice on yahoo?	I've lived in our new place for 3 years and steill haven't done the landscaping - it just seems too difficult. The land is on a block, full of clay, on the border of an Australian native reserve, is on a sweeping bend of a cul-de-sac and is just so exposed, ugly to look at and really needs a fresh set of eyes to look at it and make some suggestions.   Of course the less amount of money I have to spend on the landscaping would be a bonus (a family friend has an excavator and that's no problem in that area) but just some type of direction or idea on what to put there.  Passers by always walk on it as they think it's just open land next to the footpath.  I draw the line at native wattles as they trigger hayfever for my family but would consider almost anything else. I should mention that the block is a north/north easterly direction and is quite exposed to the elements particularly wind. It gets all day sun and any trees in this area would be ok as it wouldn't block out afternoon sun in the winter.      Any help is much appreciated.

They did manage to eat a small patch of sheetrock inside my kitchen a few years ago.  This "spot" is on the opposite side of the wall to my laundry hutch.  My clothes washer did leak throughout the hutch / kitchen until I bought a new washing machine.  -  That problem has been solved.  :-)   My problem now is clearing the 10 sq. feet patch of dead tree limbs from my back yard.     My father uses those tree limbs as firewood in his fireplace.   I am now at the cleaning-up point where all I have is small tree limbs that are too small to use as firewood.   MY QUESTION IS do termites thrive more on the large tree limbs / trunks or do they also live in the smaller twigs that I can either keep as landfill or simply take to my wood-shipping site?

Also, we run off well water that is sometimes fed by a saltwater creek...would that do it?  Combination of the two or something completely different?

I had someone come to my house the other day to give us our annual "free" system checkup that was included with an initial service we had done.  Technician called me after the checkup, and mentioned that one of our blower capacitors is on the "low range" of where it needs to be, and then quoted me a price of ~$200 to replace it.  He also quoted me various other "suggestions" (ceiling saver kit, blower cleaning, secondary pan for main system, etc.).      My question is whether or not this is something that is typically replaced, and if the price quoted is in line with what I should expect (or if it's something easy enough to replace myself with a little research)?  I don't want to be scammed by his upsell techniques, but have no idea whether it's a legit problem.

20090309123129AAdIzi9	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Looking for 2 types of trees that produce flowers...?	The first one produces small dark pink/hot pink flowers and has kinda a deep red bark. It is thin and doesn't seem to grow super large or anything. All of them that I have been seeing are on the small side.   The other tree is about the same size with lighter colored bark and produces light purple "tulip" looking flowers. I want to find them so I can plant them in my yard.

20090309131505AADfM7k	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Which side do I paint!? HELP!!!?	1. Say there is a door coming from the living room to the bedroom.   I am painting my walls a chocolate color, and the trim a cream. Do I paint the door to match the trim? Or leave it white?      2. I am painting the bed room a yellow color, with white trim, so leaving the door white isn't a problem here, but the problem is do i leave the bedroom side white, and paint the other side cream? How do I go about this?      Thank you!      3. Does a sage color carpet go with brown and cream? What about yellow and white?

20090309125510AAXCxaY	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	What kind of paint to use in the bathroom?	I currently rent and I live in a house where all the renovations are done by someone who doesn't know how to do them (ie halfassedly!). So this means that I don't have to worry about my own touches being perfect... oh, if you could only see the paint jobs in my house. My bathroom is currently painted in a flat white color... I don't know much about paint, but there's no shine to it or anything. It's less glossy than the paint used in my bedroom.       I have about half a can of blue flat paint that I'd like to paint the small bathroom with, but it's not really for bathrooms. So my question is...      I know they make specific paints for bathrooms, but, can I do it anyway and expect it to be just fine for at least a year or so? Sure maybe it's not the best choice for a bathroom, but is it really going to be that terrible? Or can I go ahead and do it anyway? The flat paint in there now is holding against moisture just fine.      Thanks for the feedback guys!

I'm going to use some extremely bright LEDs, and to make it look like a normal, and above all, stylish lamp, I need a diffusing material.   It has to let light through, yet not so much that it's transparent like a window. It also has to be white, and I want to shape it in my own style.   What kind of material is it I'm searching for, and where can I buy it?

20090309131510AA6qAdq	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Decorating My Room!!!! But I Need Some Help...?	Ok, so, I really want to redecorate my bedroom, but I need help with a few things.          1- How should I break it to my parents?      2- I'm into the pop-punk/alternative kind of music and I really want a music themed room. What should I do?      Here's a list of bands I like so you can get an idea of my music taste:         All Time Low   All American Rejects   Boys Like Girls   U2   Rolling Stones   Beatles   Fall Out Boy   Secondhand Serenade   Time Tells All   We the Kings   We the Living   Coldplay         and I'm only 12 going on 13, so I know I'm not allowed to paint my room a really dark color like black.               Please help, but not by just copy and pasting a website URL into the answer box. I want some really original ideas, not website things that everyone else does. I know that I'm going to have a really low budget, so some DIY stuff would be really good.               Please and thank you!
