The Only Girl      Now that I cannot call you mine   Now that you walked out I am fine   Though sometimes I sit and stare at the screen   Watch your songs change and   Wonder if you're staring back thinking of me      I feel the emotions choke me up like vomit   I search for a way to be happy without you   But I guess I've come to realize   Happiness doesn't exist without you in my life.       Chorus:      So I will wait   For you to return   Spend my days wasting away dreaming of   The life I wish we could have lived   But still I'm devoted to the only girl      I see you sleep as if you were next to me   I pray I could stay asleep   Because only there I can taste your lips against mine   Now that seems so far away and out of reach   Now..      Chorus.      To the only girl   My only girl   You're the only girl   The only girl      In the end I believe   You will see that I am your only as well.      Chorus.

Season three would then pick up with stories including Bricriu making a reappearance, possessing Fi who would later be saved by Molly's priest brother. Fi would have continued to investigate the paranormal but the encounter on the rooftop would have made her more cautious; the Phillips witch ancestry would be delved into; the alien thread from the past two seasons would have come full circle; Jack would have been revealed to have lived a past life as a knight (subtly alluded to in past episodes); Molly's past alcoholism (the subject of "In the Darkness") would have been addressed; and Rick's story would have continued through to the series finale of Fi going into Hell to rescue her father.....      but disney wanted a lighter tone and wouldn't allow this plot and the writers quit. cara delizia(fi) also quits. some say its before they decide this and some say it was after....      but don't you miss it?

Another day without you has gone   Without you I walk along the street   My friends all around me, but I feel alone   Like in this world there is nothing more for me.      How can I habituate myself   To live living without you?   How can I take mind off these things   Please could you tell me something new.      Another day without you has gone   People say that extremes meet   I just know I hate to live on my own   I must wake up early, but I can’t get to sleep.      I guess tomorrow will be another day   Even so. The day without you   And you will not come to me to stay   I’m not myself everyday without you…         Thank you very much.

If despite this square, there is a lot of understanding, can square become more prominent later in the relationship? What other difficulties could this square mean?      On the other hand the composite Venus shows really good aspects. Venus in 2nd, Conjunct Pluto and sextile Neptune. Can this "smooth" out the square in Synergy? (sun in the composite also has mostly harmonious aspects to it)      The reason I'm wondering is that Sun square Venus in Synergy has the most negative value assigned to it out of all other squares

[REC](Spain) - Remade as 'Quarantine' in the US.    The Orphanage (Spain) Planned US remake.   Oldboy (Japan) - Planned US remake with Will Smith.???

Since then she's been kinda withdrawn and unsociable to everyone including me, her boyfriend. Yesterday she expressed a desire to possibly split up if things keep going bad. I need a song and quick! Something to show I care about her and want her to stay with me would be best. We are both big fans of all the older 70's, 80's, 90's rock too, so from that timeframe would be appreciated.

If I should replace my pickups, which one is recommended. Everything on my bass is stock items and the bass has never been upgraded other than the strings.

You can see the pain in her face, the emotional pain.  When you look past  the swelling and bruising you can see all the humiliation and suffering she is enduring.  I hope they prosecute him to the fullest extent of the law.  No more excuses for this monster, teeny boppers.  Some people belong behind bars.       I love it that in Califirnia, the District Attorney has the power to choose whether to press charges with or without the victim's consent.  I'll bet RiRi is so frightened after having this happen to her.  The prosecutor will be strong for her and give her maybe a small taste of a silent victory since many celebs want to "wish them the best" and hope they "get back together" (like Magic Jonhson, said).      But, the question...this the picture bring tears to your eyes too?

20090219183134AAIGqrX	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	BACHELOR finale - who do YOU think Jason will pick?  And why?	My theory is a bit unorthodox -- they keep on saying Deanna is going to return to discuss wrong choices.  Most fans will interpret that as Deanna saying SHE made the wrong choice, and she should have chosen Jason last season.  Well, my theory is that Deanna comes back all right but to discuss how JASON is making the wrong choice:  And the finale will have everyone thinking he is going to pick Melissa, BUT at the last minute Jason will realize that Jillian really was the girl for him.  Besides the Passion he keeps on stressing is an important factor, Jason will finally "see the light" and decides to call Jillian back and chooses her (Jillian).  He will then know that Passion AND Best Friends are a combination that will ensure a long happy married life together.  Don't you think that would be a great "twist" -- something unique, especially since the whole concept of THE BACHELOR/BACHELORETTE shows needs a boost so people will then tune in next season with the renewed idea that  ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN !!        I welcome your opinions about my theory, as well as your own individual theories/choices!

Rate, hate, and creative criticism is loved.         Instrumental:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKlXcO4v1...       Dip my pen, in the ink bin, my pages is on a late night rhyming binge/   Writing sins, thought I’d never fly off the hinge again, with a sadden tinge/   Wish this’ll never happen again, my words playing a overlapping violin/   I’m snapping violent, love trapped in the silo within, telling my mind to pile in/   Pain’s been sitting silent, until the madness dials in, as my heart vials sin/   Broken glasses, on the floor my sanity passes, down the drain, in the sound of rain/   The scales unbalance barely by pounds of grain, the alcohol found the pain/   Eliminated it for mere minutes, until I drank every drop in it, the agony is innate/   Affection is what she instates, as my last bottle of gin breaks, this mind she dictates/   My hearts sliced open and filled with citrates, burning with the love it makes/   Made of porcelain she shoves it breaks, bleeding, trying to stitch me back together/   Karma is suppose to make you better, but it’s not when you write a fake new letter/   Cuz when you have a heartache you let her, pick you apart at the seems/   The angels felt my heart as it sings, reciting the poetic art of the kings/   As my heart starts the aching, and she once again starts the faking/   Taken apart, breaking my heart, faking’s her art, making it dark/   Blackout on the floor, wake up and it replays the act out all the horror/   Inside my cardiac she saw the tore, noticing the piece missing was called her/   A picture left stored in my memory, over years barely resembling symmetry/   Ink smeared across a faded page of tears, turned yellow from aging years/   So wise of terrors, I can say I’m a sage of fears, or a mental patent here/   Writing my poetics on the wall of my cerebellum, printing them on vellum/   So when I’m gone my voice can tell them, what I felt for her over piano keys/   Describing my anomy, over a full hand of beats, only thing keeping me alive/   Is music without it I’ll be asleep on a flat line, or hanging by a noose on a ratline/   Falling into a ocean of contentment, for once I’m actually sentient, regrets I’m penitent/   The angels voice I hear it, I can no longer endear it, sirens in the sea of heartbreak/   Repeating it’s our fate, saying we need to go our way, now my soul’s far way/   But for our sake, I write the words on the page as a score of pure love/   Filled with pain or of her love, to say these poetics are all hers hereof/         Instrumental really doesn't fit well in my opinion. Feel free to list some you think would fit better.

Callbacks were this afternoon and I got one and was really excited. The only problem was that the theatre teacher has a daugther who doesn't like me, because she thinks I "stole some boyfriend" or whatever. I didn't get the role, I found out I lost it to the daugther. She wasn't even at school. She didn't fill out the paperwork or even audition, and I know that was the reason I didn't get the part. The tryouts for alternate are tommrow and I will try to get that. I just am so sick of the mom and the daughter being rude to me, and then getting mad when I refuse to play their game. This is my last year at this school (Im transferring to a preforming highschool next year). Do you think its OK for the mom to favor the daugther? What would you do if you were me? What if you were my parent. What would you do?

I opened up the first one i grabbed (i believe it is called J-14) and read this mini article on How there would be "No Miley Duet" It was an article on how there was going to be no TH/Miley Cyrus duet. DUH!! And it said that Bill told the media that "We met miley at the VMAs and think she is very NICE" Haha being called nice is almost as bad as being calle some other bad things in my opinion...... its such a blah term....... Anyways doesn't it make you mad to see our beloved TOKIO HOTEL beside pictures of SELENA GOMEZ, MILEY CYRUS, AND THE EFFING JONAS BROTHERS!!!!!!!!!! in my opinion it is virtually IMPOSSIBLE for those people to compare TH to any of those disney-made "stars"! Doesn't It tick you off too??????????      I only felt better after I realized Tokio Hotel probably couldn't even have a NORMAL conversation with Miley Cyrus due to the language barrier.      The fact that most people wouldn't be able to understand a word of what TH said makes me feel better. I get jealous REAL fast when it comes to Tokio Hotel:)

20090219201542AAgu6zw	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	How much influence do you think your own free will has on your birthchart?	I hear a lot of comments here that go along the lines of, "you are what you make yourself", and "squares can always be used positively".   Now, I'm a big believer in taking into account experiences and human psychological functions in behaviour, as well as making the most out of what you've got.      However, sometimes I wonder... certain tough placements in a birthchart seem almost unavoidable from what I have observed. I mean, I WANT to believe that you can overcome anything, but to be quite honest I have never seen someone overcome the innate problems that are indicated in their birthchart. Maybe it's just that people don't try hard enough, or go about it the right way. I hate to think things are set in stone, but that is just my observation.      What are your opinions?

20090219193134AAB6YV9	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Have you seen the movie "The Wackness"?	Okay, I was always interested in it since I saw the trailer for it.   I thaught I would be able to relate with the main character (Josh Peck), a white kid who listens to rap music and has a hard time "getting laid". lol, (not funny).      So I'm watching this movie thinking I'd be impressed with the way the Hip-Hop music would be portreyed, but no. This kid claimed to be a Hip-Hop Head and he said, unlike the kids at school, he was loyal to he music giving his only evidence, "Man, I still listen to cassettes". Keep in mind that this movie took place in '94, WHEN THAT SAME OLDSCHOOL MUSIC WAS POPULAR and WHEN EVERYONE STILL LISTENED TO CASSETTES. He went to his classmates' parties,and everyone there was blasting Wu-Tang. The time and setting was really only applicable when Josh Peck went to see his "Jamacian" drug dealer Method Man, and he had some new tunes blasting in the room, and Josh says "Who's this?" and Method Man says "It's new sh-t. They call him Biggie." I was only impressed by Method Man's part.      As for the movie itself, it was about Josh Peck's troubles in life so he deals his drugs to a psychaitrist, who became his friend, in exchange for therapy sessions. So they always got high together and Josh ends up falling in love with the psycaitrist's step daughter, but she doesn't love him, she's just bored in the summer.      Then sh-t gets flipped a little bit and the movie just ends.      --I hope you've seen it, otherwise it just seems like I'm ranting.      But, the end of this movie kinda messed up my evening. It wasn't anything exciting, it just left questions in my head, and none of the characters were really "happy".      And what's the most dissapointing part of the movie, is that Josh Peck's character, the kid I thought I would be able to identify with, is a friggin' moron. He kinda just goes thru life. And as the audience member, we should able to see him acting more impulsively when he's not in public, like when he's in his room, he should be looking in a mirror or talking to himself to relect on his thoughts or his emotions. But, no, he just sits around in public, and lays around in private.      This was, without-a-doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Basically, someone gave me this lotion that smells like sandalwood and cinnamon [heavy on the cinnamon] because apparently there was a survey she read that said a lot of guys get turned on by the scent of sandalwood, cinnamon and/or pumpkin [yeah idk lol].       So I tried it. You know how well it worked? My husband ignored me and played video games with my little brother for an hour, took a shower, said "omfg. is that nasty *** smell you?" and went to bed. LOL. Apparently, he doesn't like the smell that much! =P       So I'm wondering if any guy is turned on by the scent, or if the survey was made up. THANKS! =D

20090219193718AAheLEf	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Looking for songs similar to ......?	hey this might be a little fun. k, so i found this song i really like and i would like to find more music like it.    its sort of a "heavy" alternative sort of song i guess. i don't really know what genre it would fit best. its some form of rock.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR6p4phW2...    listen to the whole thing, skip around through it, doesn't really matter because throughout the song it all has the same kinda feel.   I really like the "feel" of this song. its this upbeat grungy kinda music that makes you wanna do something. it makes you feel real good.      so what i want is more songs with a very similar feel and sound to it. Ive looked around at many of this band's other songs but they vary quite a bit. this is their only song that really has this sort of feel to it.       please suggest particular songs. it gets hard to look up new music by band. you have to listen to like 20 of their songs before you find their good ones and such...    so please suggest songs that are similar to this, thanks!!

20090219194626AAt6kye	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Dragon Ball Z Manga or Anime?	For me, the manga is 100% better.       I thought I would watch the episode when Trunks dies after Cell comes back, because I had just read it and wanted to see the differences. It was terrible. Cell spent ten minutes talking about how each part of his body was regenerated. Then they start saying Trunks is still alive? NO! In the manga, Trunks is dead the second he gets hit. And then Vegeta starts monologuing about how he should have treated Trunks better (which is totally out of his character). In the manga, he sees Trunks die, says "T-Trunks...", then shouts out in anger, and fires the blast at Cell. Then he starts shooting chi blasts over and over, and Cell comes out and hits him. This took an entire two pages in the manga, and took ten minutes in the anime.    Wow. I couldn't even continue watching. I can't wait until they finish the redo of the anime with most of the filler cut out.      What about you? Do you like the DBZ manga or Anime better?

20090219183747AA9wY1i	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Can you list some albums that you think are exceptionally well produced?	Any genre is fine.  Also, any year is fine.  Obviously, the production is going to be judged relative to the technology available at the time the album was released.  For example, The Doors' debut came out in 1967, and it has remarkably good production for an album released at that time.      "Dark Side of the Moon (1973)" is another example of a remarkably well produced album for its time.

SONG 1: I'll start this broken heart I'll fix it up so it will work again Better than before Then I'll star in a mystery A tragic tale of all that's yet to come Fingers crossed there will be love But I get carried away with every day And every fantasy the deeper the wound, the harder I swoon and wish that that was me So much to say But no words to convey The loneliness building with each passing day But I'm getting used to it, you have to get used to it I'll devise the best disguise A brand new look and take them by surprise They'll never guess what's not inside I'll express myself with ease, With confidence and character complete With fingers crossed they'll talk to me But I get carried away with every page In every magazine The cheaper the thrill the deeper I fill my head with blasphemy So much to say But No words to convey The loneliness building with each passing day But I'm getting used to it, you have to get used to it I'll destroy this useless heart I'll **** it up so it'll never beat again Not just for me but for anyone But I get carried away with every phrase and made up malady The longer I hide behind these lies, The more I disintegrate So much to say But no words to convey The loneliness building with each passing day But I never get used to it, you just have to live with it          SONG 2: Down to you You're pushing and pulling me Down to you But I don't know what I Now when I caught myself I had to stop myself From saying something that I should have never thought Now when I caught myself I had to stop myself From saying something that I should have never thought Of you, of you You're pushing and pulling me Down to you But I don't know what I want No, I don't know what I want You got it, You got it Some kind of magic Hypnotic, Hypnotic You're leaving me breathless I hate this, I hate this You're not the one I believe in When God is my witness Now when I caught myself I had to stop myself From saying something that I should have never thought Now when I caught myself I had to stop myself From saying something that I should have never thought Of you, of you You're pushing and pulling me Down to you But I don't know what I want No, I don't know what I want Don't know what I want But I know it's not you Keep pushing and pulling me down When I know in my heart it's not you Now when I caught myself I had to stop myself From saying something that I should have never thought Now when I caught myself I had to stop myself From saying something that I should have never thought Of you, I knew I know in my heart it's not you I knew But now I know what I want I want I want Oh no, I should have never thought          SONG 3: When somethings pure How can people just say We're not meant to be And when somethings true How can people just Keep me away from you Suddenly I'm all alone Pushed away from nothing wrong Don't you have the guts to say How you feel about me Out of the blue They said we couldn't be together I have to get over you We've been given no choice, We have no voice Out of the blue Can't even call on the telephone Don't even know if you're at home But to control just how we feel Between you and I Not for one to steal Suddenly I'm all alone Pushed away from nothing wrong Don't you have the guts to say How you feel about me Out of the blue They said we couldn't be together I have to get over you We've been given no choice, We have no voice Just wanna hear what you've got to say Are you feeling the same 'Cause I'm not okay Thought when we met there was something more But the others said no - they shut the door Out of the blue They said we couldn't be together I have to get over you We've been given no choice, We have no voice Out of the blue We should have been together Don't wanna get over you When love makes a choice, it has a voice Out of the blue         SONG 4: Don't know where you are Wish I just could be near you I would sail oceans To get a glimpse of how you feel You're all the things I'm looking For everything and so much more What I think You are just perfect Could it be That I am worth it Is this thing an open door Walk right through to something more You and me My life would change in a second In a second Don't know how you feel You seem to keep it to yourself Would you climb mountains To show me this is something real You're all the things I'm looking For everything and so much more What I think You are just perfect Could it be That I am worth it Is this thing an open door Walk right through to something more You and me My life would change in a second In a second Could it be Could it be You and me You and me Do I see Do I see Clearly What I think You are just perfect Could it be That I am worth it Is this thing an open door Walk right through to something more What I think You are just perfect Could it be That I am worth it Is this thing an open door Walk right through to something more You and me My life would change in a second In a second

20090219185004AAmiO6n	Entertainment & Music;Music;Singing	How would you define good singing? bad singing? Is bad singing when you sing monotone or all over the place...?	and out of control?        I don't know if the distinction is universal and objective, but many ppl do agree on what a bad voice is (american idol rejects).  Or perhaps we are conditioned to classify some voices as wretched and others angelic.  Maybe it's a cultural thing.      What do you think?  Are there any scientific studies that have investigated human perception of singing?  (much like science has tried to define beauty).

We spend so much money on other countries with invasions and help. If we can spend so much money on other countries, we can afford universal healthcare in america. How do you feel about that movie?

Has anyone ever seen a French foreign film about your typical family living in the suburbs, you the type, Mother, Father 3 kids (I think).  Except that the middle child, a grade-school aged boy has extreme feminine tendencies.

Until he actually believes his a girls and tries to make the next door neighbors son his "boyfriend".  The parents love their son so much, just the way he is, they confront anyone who has something negative to say about their son or their family.  It's a great flick, I'd love to watch it again, but I can't remember the title.  Thanks
