20090307120857AAuO5iT	Travel;Africa & Middle East;South Africa	How safe is Johannesburg and Cape Town to visit alone?	How safe is Johannesburg and Cape Town to visit for a 20 year old white Australian male? I've heard mixed views. Some people, primarily South Africans who have moved to Australia, have told me it's virtually anachy and how anyone alone gets shot/raped/mugged/beaten/murdered, etc, and how I should basically avoid the place like the plague.      However, other South Africans have told me that on the whole the danger of Johannesburg and Cape Town is overplayed, and in reality providing you take resonable precaution and don't go walking around randomly in the middle of night, a visit will probably be incident free.       I suspect the truth is somewhere in the middle of those two extremes, but I'd like some more info.      Thanks

I would be landing at Peshawer airport and then going to Mardan where my bf's family lives.  Are they really far away from each other?   Also, is it okay to where my own clothes when I am there or is that a bad choice?  Should I buy one of those Kamiz dresses?  Also, what kind of food should I expect?  Is it safe? What is there to do for someone who is visiting?  The reason I ask if that my boyfriend thinks its the best place in the world but I sort of want a more unbiased view.    Thank u.

I'm moving to San Diego in October because my husband is stationed there and I want to be with when he arrives from his deployment. My major is Childhood Education and Psychology. How do I start off? Do i go to a community college first then transfer? Will I have to take out a loan because over here I had finacial aid. Also what schools should I look at?

The leaders have to see proof that we went, so somewhere we can take pictures would be good, or like the movies or skiing where you get a ticket thingy.

However, i have heard recent reports in italy about RAMPANT, DEADLY racism. I dont look FULLY-FLEDGED ITALIAN, but i am a light-yellow skinned male with short, shiny curly hair, and bright brown eyes. the reason im stating how i look is because racism usually starts from someone just glancing at you, and i dont look lke a FULL FLEDGED ITALIAN, and that may lead to an attack. So tell me, because i REALLY want to study in ROME.

20090307152121AAxf8KE	Travel;Australia;Other - Australia	For a Australia 462 visa, do they always check your bank statement, and when do they?	I was looking into doing a working holiday as an au pair in Australia. I read that I need $5000 AUD in my account, because they "may" check. Do they? Is it only if you don't have a job lined up? If I were to go, I would only do so if I have a job/host family set up prior to leaving, and I would stay with them the entire trip. I would also have a round trip ticket.  I don't have that amount in my account, but my father would be supporting me from overseas and depositing money as I need it. I just won't have a lump sum. I will be earning a very decent living though, and won't be paying for my lodging.      Do I have anything to be concerned over? I have also read they tend not to bother when you come from a "wealthy" country. Is this true?
