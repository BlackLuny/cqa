Bd16ixUQaa	Here is how you solve problems like these:<br>  <br>  Take whatever fraction unit you're working in - in this example its halves- and draw lines to divide every circle into these fractional units. So, in this case, you would divide every circle they give you in half (into halves)<br>  <br>  Then shade in what they tell you.<br>  <br>  In this case you shade in one whole circle first.<br>  Because remember for mixed numbers, there is an invisible 'and' between the whole number and the fraction, so the fraction reads:<br>  one AND five halves. This means shade in one whole circle and five halve sized pieces of circles.<br>  <br>  So, I'll walk you through.<br>  <br>  So, first you have 1.<br>  This means you shade in 1 whole circle.<br>  <br>  Then you take you second circle and divide it in half.<br>  Do the same for the third circle.<br>  And the fourth circle.<br>  etc.<br>  <br>  Then shade in 5 of those half pieces you just made.<br>  <br>  When you are finished, you will have:<br>  1 whole circle from the 1 they started you with.<br>  both halves shaded in for your second circle which equals one whole.<br>  (that's 2 halves down)<br>  both halves shaded in for your third circle which equals one whole.<br>  (that's 2 more halves down; we've shaded a total of 4 halves at this point)<br>  and one halve shaded in for your fourth circle.<br>  (there's your fifth halve!!!)<br>  In total you've shaded in 1 whole circle, and 5 halves (or half sized pieces).<br>  <br>  If you count them up, you've got a total of 3 whole circles shaded in and one half circle shaded in or 3 1/2|`|1WG0iCQWaa	You have at least six circles.

Due to the fact that the gas that the earliest stars formed from was 'pristine' (meaning it had no elements heavier than helium, and that was only trace amounts) the first generation of stars could get larger than they can in the 2nd or 3rd generations.  It is speculated that stellar masses in excess of 100 Msun were common in the 1st gen stars.  <br>  <br>  Stars this big live very short lives, on the order of a few million years, so easily enough time to fit in that time frame.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	The more massive the star, the shorter its lifespan.<br>  This is mostly because massive stars have more gravity exerting greater pressure on their cores, which means they have to fuse hydrogen faster to maintain enough heat to balance the gravity.  The most massive stars last an average of about a million years.

nHQ2W6Ijaa	The rate of a reaction, r, depends on concentration.  They are related by the rate law: r=k*dc/dt.  But the rate constant, k, is a function of Temperature ONLY, NOT concentration.  Overall activation energy will depend upon the amount of reactant you have (i.e. moles of reactant), but the activation energy per mole will not be affected by the concentration.  So if you have the same number of moles, but at different concentrations, the activation energies will be the same.|`|vGjxpHD9aa	I think it would but I am not completely sure <br>  <br>  <br>  XxX|`|AA11318863	yeah rate of reaction increases or decrease  with concentration..i.e. its directly proportional to concentration where as activation energy doesn't....its the minimum amount of energy required to start a reaction so it isn't related to concentration at all..
KHeR3hGIaa	Well, cars and tractors and such have electric components too -- so they would not work.<br>  <br>  Food could not be transported, and farmers would have a much harder time producing it without their tractors.<br>  <br>  Millions of people would starve, as less food would be created and there would be no way to get it to the people.  Boats would be stranded.  Planes would crash.  Our economy would collapse immediately.  <br>  <br>  Overall, It would harm people immensely.<br>  <br>  It would help those who are already living without electricity and are able to defend themselves against the starving masses who walk or bike over from the cities looking for food.  They could possibly set themselves up as little warlords, with the with city people who appear as their serfs, forced to work the land for food.<br>  <br>  What would the rest of the world do?  They'd send in aid, but if their electrical devices stopped working at the US borders they'd be unable to get food in.  They could redesign their vehicles to work without electricity, but that would take time.  If whatever broke the electricity lasted forever, eventually most of the people in the US would either leave or die, and those left would be sent back to a 1800s style lifestyle.<br>  <br>  It might benefit the entire world.  With the US out of the picture, other countries would rise to power.  Global warming would be slowed by a significant degree, but not enough to fix the problem.  And of course the rest of the world would be very busy trying to figure out what happened in the US to break all electrical equipment -- can they fix it?  Could it happen to them?  Could they prevent it?<br>  <br>  Now, if it was only the electrical grid that failed and cars and such kept working, it wouldn't be quite so bad, but it would still be very bad.  Our economy would collapse -- food could still be created and transported, but it would be harder to pay for it, and the farmers won't work for free.  And food is only a small part of our economy, so farmers who can work without electricity would be rich, and everybody else would be dirt poor.  (Of course, guns would still work, and so the hungry masses would likely kill the farmers and take their food.)<br>  <br>  Cars need gasoline, and the infrastructure that provides this (refineries, gas stations, etc.) runs on the electrical grid.  So unless that could be worked out, the cars and tractors and such would stop working within a few days and we'd be headed towards the scenario I gave above.  People would be very motivated to work it out, however, and so they'd be looking for ways around whatever magical thing broke everything electrical.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, the end result depends on exactly what catastrophe befalls the electrical devices and the specifics of what it did -- what devices are broken, can they be fixed, can it be worked around, etc.  At worst, most of the US would starve, leave or be killed in food riots, and the rest would be heavily armed and living like it was 1800.  At best, our economy would take a big hit for a while, but people would get whatever the problem was fixed in a few days and life would continue.|`|AA11537248	It would benefit the people who are able to provide for themselves, like farmers and hunters.<br>  <br>  I imagine that urban areas would be mass riots.|`|7o3DMzXQaa	benefit: we would be able to see the stars at night<br>  harm: people in hospitals relying on machines would die|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	I'd guess that 90% of the population would die in the next few years, with most of the rest reduced to canibalism.<br>  <br>  Remember with no electricity, you have no autos, aircraft, boats (except sail boats).

You can also try joining the Air Force if you want to be a shuttle pilot.  Keep in mind it's extremely competitive, so don't get a science degree just to become an astronaut, because it's not likely to happen for anyone - find a job you really like and will be happy doing either way.

WRyHOEjSaa	Well it’s either A or D.  I’d go with A.  The simplest cladogram would show a single fork, resulting in two populations.  Each line after the fork would constitute a monophyletic lineage.  A cladogram wouldn’t be able to adequately show a situation in which monophyly isn’t followed, such as the hybridization of two genetically separate lines.<br>  <br>  My only problem with D is that cladograms need not show species relationships. They can show relationships of subspecies, or of genera, or of other taxonomic ranks, so long as all populations involved are essentially isolated genetically. You can't assume you're looking at inferred species relationships.<br>  <br>  Edit: Gardengallivant (below) wrote: "Cladograms can be monophyletic or show a single clade. They do not have to show two or more."<br>  <br>  Response:  It's difficult because a cladogram typically does show a single monophyletic lineage. However, that single lineage typically has multiple monophyletic lineages within it. The two or more lines extending from any node (fork) each represent the beginning of a new monophyletic lineage, which is a subset of the whole. So to establish a cladogram with only one monophyletic lineage you'd have to avoid all nodes, and just show a single line. I've never seen or heard of such a cladogram. There would be no point to it, since it couldn't show how one population related to another.|`|YYLybWHSaa	D is correct. <br>  <br>  Cladograms depict relationships between the selected taxonomic groups. They can show time in general by altering the branch lengths to show sequences of evolutionary events.

MFcSwTFpaa	Speed is relative.  It is judged by picking a spot to be considered at rest and judging the movement of something else relative to that fixed location.  Your rambling is essentially correct.  two asteroids moving at .6 light speed in opposite directions relative to a fixed observer are indeed moving apart faster than the speed of light.  individually they do not exceed the speed of light but relative to one another they appear to do so.  the center of the universe is fixed relative to everything else and can be used to judge the speed of all else.|`|oYb4yC0jaa	You forgot the speed at which galaxies move away from each other, also known as Hubble's Constant.|`|BoUeBvYQaa	The short answer to your asteroid paradox is that relative speeds don't add together in the "normal" way when things are traveling very fast.  (This is one of the results of relativity.)<br>  <br>  There is no "true speed" (in the sense of  an _absolute_ speed); only speed relative to a given observer.  And where we once thought that space and time were unrelated (so that any relative speed were possible), we now know that space and time are tied together by the constant "c", in such a way that nothing can travel at greater than "c" relative to any given observer.<br>  <br>  Let's take your example and plug in some numbers.  Say we have two asteroids traveling in the same path at .99c relative to some observer, and the two asteroids are 1 light year apart.<br>  <br>  The first thing to note is that, from the point of view an observer on either of the asteroids, they two asteroids are NOT 1 light year apart; from that point of view they're actually something like 7 ly apart.  This is the "length contraction" effect, that says that distances between points are relative to the observer.<br>  <br>  The second thing to note is that, from the point of view of the "stationary" observer, the clocks on the asteroids are ticking only 1/7 as fast as they should be; this is the "time dilation" effect.<br>  <br>  Since there are differences in the ways the two observers perceive distances and time, it should be no surprise that they also differ in their judgements of distance divided by time; i.e. speed.<br>  <br>  Okay, let's say you're on the leading asteroid, and you throw a baseball back to the trailing asteroid at a speed (relative to yourself) of 0.99c.  From your point of view, the baseball has to travel about 7 light years at (nearly) the speed of light, so it seems to take about 7 years for the baseball to get to the other asteroid.<br>  <br>  From the point of view of a stationary observer, the baseball's apparent speed follows this formula:<br>  <br>  v = (u - w)/(1 - uw/c2)<br>  <br>  where "u" is the asteroid's speed (relative to stationary observer) and "w" is baseball's speed (relative to asteroid).  In this case, both "u" and "w" are 0.99c, so "v" is zero.<br>  <br>  This is just a long-winded way of saying that the baseball looks stationary from the stationary observer's point of view.  To him, it looks as though the baseball is floating while the two asteroids speed past it.  And from his point of view, this takes only 1 year, since the two asteroids (to him) are 1 ly apart.<br>  <br>  Now let's say the people on Asteroid #2 catch the baseball, and decide to send it flying back at the same speed (0.99c).  This is where the fun begins.  From the point of view of Asteroid #2, the ball travels forward at 0.99c.  But from the point of view of the stationary observer, the ball is going at:<br>  <br>  v = (.99c + .99c) / (1 + (.99c)(.99c)/c2) = 0.9999495c<br>  <br>  In other words, it's going faster than the asteroids, but it's STILL not exceeding the speed of light.  In fact, from the "stationary" observer's point of view, the baseball on its return trip is just barely keeping ahead of the asteroid, and in fact takes much, much longer (about 100 years) to make the return trip, than it took to do the first leg.|`|16Wyr0Ouaa	It's however fast sonic the hedgehog can run. And yes I'm intelligent just not particularly helpful. My only redeeming quality is my hair. It smells of coconuts|`|vPqk1SGHaa	Our understanding is that universe is a three dimensional space. Problem is that there are no fixed points in it, so we can measure only relative speeds, as you had explained.<br>  At present, I do not know how to determine absolute speed. However, I think that there is no need to know that.  <br>  Long ago philosophers realized that we can never know absolute truth about universe because we ultimately must rely on our senses and reason and these are fallible. The best that we can hope for is a relative truth - agreement between our thinking and our experiences. <br>  Einstein's theory is a bit like a ruler made of elastic rubber - every measurement agrees with whatever you want to, but overall is useless. <br>  There is no point to question Einstein's theory because one can not argue with someone who rejected common sense.
78b3d834e72deac7083fdd58233b5cbfaa	There is no earthquake that only has P waves, they all have P, S, and surface waves.  If you only read P waves, then you are in the S wave shadow, which mean the earthquake happened on the other side of the earth (from you) and the S waves were blocked by the liquid outer core, because S waves can only travel through liquids.|`|AA12139405	That means you are away from epicenter that needs to travel through water. S wave can not travel through liquid. Unless the S wave arrives at the surface of earth you can not get L & R waves. If the earthquakes are stronger it may take more time to reach the seismic station because of several refraction and reflection under earth core.

G3LpGWXbaa	Try using the analogy of water. In a water hose the force would be measured in PSI instead of Volts. The flow rate would be measured in GPM instead of Amperes. The resistance to the flow of water of the hose would be measured in inches of water column instead of Ohms.<br>  <br>  For a given PSI there will be more GPM in a larger diameter or shorter hose than in a smaller diameter or longer hose. This is akin to the resistance property of a length of wire. In a wire you are pushing free electrons. The more free electrons in a conductor, the lower its resistance to flow (Amperes) for a given force (Volts). Some of the ways in which you can decrease a conductors resistance are by making its cross section larger or using a shorter length.<br>  <br>  As far as why energy is converted in an electrical load, we can still use the water analogy. Imagine that there is an impeller inserted in the hose. The impellers shaft is connected to a mechanical load. The impeller would have to use up some of the force (PSI) and resist the flow of water (GPM) in order to perform work. The same thing happens in an electrical load. If you have a force (Volts) and a rate (Amperes) then you are performing work (Watts). Work over time is energy (Watt Hours or Joules).|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	You need to ask a more explicit question. <br>  <br>  wikipedia:<br>  The electrical resistance of an object is a measure of its opposition to the passage of a steady electrical current. The SI unit of resistance is the Ohm. Its reciprocal quantity is electrical conductance measured in siemens. An object of uniform cross section will have a resistance proportional to its length and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area, and proportional to the resistivity of the material.<br>  Discovered by Georg Ohm in the late 1820s, electrical resistance shares some conceptual parallels with the mechanical notion of friction. The SI unit of electrical resistance is the ohm, symbol Ω.<br>  The resistance of a resistive object determines the amount of current through the object for a given potential difference across the object, in accordance with Ohm's law: I = V/R<br>  <br>  .

If you write this out, one on top of the other, you'll see the blank spot is in the lower right hand corner. You take the two values that are diagonal of eachother and multiply them (2y * 25x) (hence the 'cross-multiply'), and then divide by the remaining value (10). This will give you:<br>  <br>  2y * 25x = 50xy <br>  50xy / 10 = 5xy|`|JUmfm168aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Note that you have gone from 10 to 2y.<br>  <br>  To get from 10 to 2, you must divide by 5. We'll call this (1).<br>  <br>  Next, to get from 2 to 2y, you multiply by y. We'll call this (2).<br>  <br>  Now, you begin at 25x.<br>  (1) : 25x divided by 5 = 5x.<br>  (2) : 5x multiplied by y = 5xy.|`|gTDzR23jaa	Okay,<br>  You know that (10/2)y is 2y, right?<br>  So you do: 25x/5 equals 5x, and 5x times y is 5xy<br>  Hope this helps!

Your own cited article says so as well.<br>  <br>  Edit: Alright, I see farther down in your article that the original discoverer of the soft tissue still thinks it's at least partly dinosaur tissue. Assuming that's so, I still don't see that as evidence against the fossils being millions of years old. The bacterial biofilm could well have protected some of the original proteins, and in an anoxic environment we wouldn't expect further bacterial attacks after the anoxic bacteria that formed the biofilms ate what they could and died out.|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	> fresh bone tissue found in the partially fossilized dinosaur<br>  <br>  LOL.

Otherwise, no one is going to believe you.<br>  <br>  And secondly, that would have more to do with fossilization, and how it could have been preserved for so long intact.  Not so much an evolution issue.<br>  <br>  EDIT: That's an interesting article.  I wasn't aware of that.  But my point remains valid.  It would not go against evolution.  If indeed it was soft tissue remnants of T-Rex, then more research would be conducted to see how the tissue had been preserved for so long.<br>  <br>  It sounded like the dates are still good/accurate, from the article.  So the only thing that comes into question is how did it survive intact for so long.

Keep in mind that fossils are simply things that have been buried in the ground for some (usually long) period of time.  You may be confusing fossilization with mineralization, where the organic materials are replaced with minerals so that the original bone or wood or whatever turns to rock.  I'm not sure how finding tissue in a fossil conflicts with evolution though - that's happened many times, although it would be massively cool to find some in a dinosaur bone.  In this particular case, it seems more likely that the material is a bacterial residue than actual dinosaur tissue, although the claim that bird-like protein fragments were extracted is certainly interesting.  The link below gives a good summary, although it's about a year old.  I haven't been keeping up with the paleo news so there may be newer information around.

If your body is well hydrated, your veins dialate. When dehydrated, they contract, making it harder to find the vein. The other is scarring due to over-puncturing a vein. In this case, it's important to alternate arms when giving blood. Sometimes it's not an issue of not being able to find a vein, but more-so just harder to actually "catch" it. Some people have veins referred to as "rolling veins" that like to dodge the needle evertime it's pressed upon.|`|lXE75yQjaa	Yes, the more you are poked, the harder it is to get into the vein.

2lQ8DJAcaa	Yes. India was once part of the Gondwanaland which consisted of the whole of Africa <br>  <br>  Throughout most of geologic time there were only two primordial continents: Laurasia in the north and Gondwanaland in the south, separated by the Sea of Tethys. Gondwanaland consisted of Africa, peninsular India, Australia, South America, Antarctica and Eurasian regions south of the Alpine-Himalayan chain. About 265 million years ago, this continental togetherness began to split. For 200 million years, India, Arabia, and Apulia (consisting of parts of Italy, the Balkan states, Greece, and Turkey) drifted across the ocean, and finally collided with the rest of Eurasia 65 million years ago. The collision uplifted the Alpine-Himalayan mountain ranges extending from Spain (the Pyrenees) and northwest Africa (the Atlas) along the northern margin of the Mediterranean Sea (the Alps, Carpathians) into southern Asia (the Himalayas) to reach Indonesia.|`|eVIUwF1waa	No, India was part of Australia you can see the outline of India and see the missing outline in Australia.

dGN8YoEQaa	-what is it?<br>       *Plankton is the foundation of the ocean food web. <br>       *Phytoplankton are organisms that float on or near the surface of the water. Most are rounded and single-celled. All phytoplankton use photosynthesis for their energy. The most common phytoplankton are diatoms and dinoflagellates. <br>       *Zooplankton are ocean animals that don't swim at all or are very weak swimmers, and they drift or move with ocean currents. They can be found in the sunlit zone and in deep ocean waters. Zooplankton range in size from tiny microbes to jellyfish, although most zooplankton are tiny, single-celled organisms. There are two types of zooplankton. Permanent or holoplankton will always be zooplankton. Temporary or meroplankton are made up of the larvae of fish, crustaceans and other marine animals. <br>  <a href="http://www.nhptv.org/NATUREWORKS/nwep6d.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhptv.org/NATUREWORKS/nwep6d....</a><br>  <br>  Plankton consist of any drifting organisms (animals, plants, archaea, or bacteria) that inhabit the pelagic zone of oceans, seas, or bodies of fresh water. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton</a><br>  <br>  -where is it found/located?<br>  Many marine plankton are found in the deep waters of the outer ocean, or pelagic waters, whereas others are found in the shallow waters known as the neritic zone. <br>  <a href="http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Oc-Po/Plankton.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Oc-Po/P...</a><br>  <br>  -why is it important?<br>  Phytoplankton are responsible for making up to 90% of Earth's oxygen.<br>  <a href="http://www.whyplankton.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whyplankton.com/</a><br>  Blue whales, bowhead whales, baleen whales, gray whales, humpbacks, and right whales all eat plankton. <br>  <a href="http://www.whyplankton.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whyplankton.com/</a><br>  They provide a crucial source of food to aquatic life.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton</a><br>  <br>  -what would happen if it disappeared?<br>  Phytoplankton use CO2 for survival, which means that the more phytoplankton there are, the more CO2 will be sucked out of the air.

The word plankton comes from the Greek word planktos, which means ‘wandering’ or ‘drifting’. Plankton dominates the well-lit surface layers of the world's oceans<br>  <br>  -where is it found/located? - Plankton are found throughout the oceans, seas and lakes of Earth. However, the local abundance of plankton varies horizontally, vertically and seasonally. The primary source of this variability is the availability of light. All plankton ecosystems are driven by the input of solar energy  and this confines primary production to surface waters, and to geographical regions and seasons when light is abundant. <br>  <br>  -why is it important? - They  provide the primary food source for the zooplankton, and together form the base of the oceanic food chain.  Larger and larger zooplankton, fish, and mammals depend on these plankton for their survival.   Tying it all together, the bacterioplankton play an important role in the recycling and remineralization of materials and energy within the food chain. <br>  <br>  -what would happen if it disappeared? - could cause danger to the Blue Whale. most life on earth ultimately depends on plants for nourishment. In the ocean, microscopic animals called zooplankton graze on the pastures of plankton. These little animals are ultimately eaten by larger zooplankton, by fish and as amazing as it may sound, by the largest creature of all - the blue whale. <br>  <br>  -Is it affected by global warming? - Scientists led by Jef Huisman of the University of Amsterdam have calculated that global warming, which is causing the temperature of the sea surface to rise, will also interfere with the vital upward movement of nutrients from the deep sea.<br>  <br>  These nutrients, containing nitrogen, phosphorus and iron, are vital food for phytoplankton. If the supply is interrupted the plants die off, which prevents them from absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

NbdTgyLPaa	It depends, but it depends mostly on the father of your child.  Since men are the ones with both the X and Y chromosomes, it's the man's sperm that determines the sex of a child.<br>  <br>  As other posters have pointed out, you have *roughly* a 50% chance of either a boy or a girl.  While the man's sperm will have either the X or Y chromosome which determines the sex of the child, this does *not* mean each are equally likely.  You should be able to examine the statistics for the sex of newborns in your country on the CIA website.  (I've included links to both the USA and UK in my sources.)  If you are in either of those countries, you will see that the ratio of is 1.05 boys to every 1 girl child born.  This would mean you would have approximately a 48.8% chance of having a girl if you lived in either.<br>  <br>  Also as others have also pointed out, the sex of a child is not dependent on the sex of children that were born before them.  However, it's possible that the sex of previous children might indicate the father was predisposed to have a child of one sex or another.<br>  <br>  In a study done many years ago, it was found that men who worked as pilots and were flying before conception, fathered girls far more often than the norm.  (See my third source.)  If I recall correctly, there was also a similar study that found a greater than normal occurrence of girl babies to boy babies when the father was in a very high stress occupation.|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	About 50%.|`|XLVRRtBaaa	Take a penny flip it. 50/50 shot it will be heads.<br>  Flip it again what are the chances it will be heads? 50/50.|`|mRG0W5Yxaa	A rough approximation would be 50:50, but it's probably not exactly that.

OJNBYgenaa	Both products probably work the same. When taken after a cold starts, vitamin C supplements do not make a cold shorter or less severe. When taken as a daily preventive medicine, vitamin C very slightly shortens cold duration — by 8% in adults and by 13.6% in children. When given as a preventive medicine to highly fit people in conditions of extreme cold — data based mostly on marathon runners — vitamin C cuts the risk of getting a cold in half. The average adult who suffers with colds for 12 days a year would still suffer for 11 days a year if that person took a high dose of vitamin C every day. <br>  <br>  Vitamin C is one of the safest and most effective nutrients. It may not be the cure for the common cold. But the benefits of vitamin C may include protection against immune system deficiencies, cardiovascular disease, prenatal health problems, eye disease, and even skin wrinkling.

Natural selection is the gradual adaptation in the dna to help the organism survive in their own environment, this happens slowly in each generation
NbdTgyLPaa	No.<br>  <br>  To quote Wikipedia, "Artificial selection (or selective breeding) describes intentional breeding for certain traits, or combination of traits. It was defined by Charles Darwin in contrast to natural selection, in which the differential reproduction of organisms with certain traits is attributed to improved survival or reproductive ability (Darwinian fitness"). Artificial selection can also be unintentional; it is thought that domestication of crops by early humans was largely unintentional."<br>  <br>  There are two key parts.  Being artificial basically means something done by humans.  The second part is that the breeding must be done for certain traits.  Dogs are a great example of this.  The approximate size, shape of body, color of their coat, etc. are all things that were selectively bred for to create the various breeds.<br>  <br>  When humans from different nationalities have children together, it's no different that when humans from the same nation have children together.  There might be a certain amount of artificial selection involved, as in someone wanting to marry a tall person to have tall children.  But that sort of thing is not the main reason people choose a mate, nor does it have anything to do with whether or not the mate is from a different country.|`|XLVRRtBaaa	It is if you are trying to create a certain trait. For example, a black man and a white woman mate for the purpose of having a light skinned black child. <br>  We don't term this artificial selection since no one mates for the sole purpose of getting a certain offsrping. Artioficial selection is used in agriculture. For example, brocccoli is an example of artificial selection.

2cq46sDeaa	For a feedback control system, you have a demand and a feedback.<br>  <br>  By subtracting the demand from the feedback, you determine the error.<br>  <br>  For proportional control, you multiply the error by the proportional gain to drive the output device to correct the error.<br>  <br>  When you achieve the demanded value, the error will be zero<br>  <br>  This means that proportional control can be used for instance to control the height of an aircraft via its elevator, because when you are the desired height, the elevator should be centered.<br>  <br>  It cannot be used to control the speed of a DC motor via its armature voltage as the speed is roughly proportional to the armature voltage and therefore you require an output from the control system to aintain the speed|`|qaMPEdL2aa	Too vague. <br>  <br>  For proportional control of water level in a tank where you have control of a valve that admits water but no control over how much goes out, proportional control means that the speed of the valve is proportional to the error signal, the difference between ideal level and actual level.

DNA<br>  <br>  RNA polymerase binds to the promoter sequence on the DNA to start transcribing RNA(mRNA, rRNA, tRNA) from one strand of DNA going 5' to 3'. Transcription stops when terminator sequence is reached. <br>  <br>  The mRNA binds to the rRNA (makes up the ribosomal subunits). The mRNA contains codons (3 nucleotides) and bind to an anticodon location on the tRNA. tRNA contains an amino acid (there are 64 condons that code for 20 amino acids).<br>  <br>  the tRNA enters the A-site of the ribosome and binds to the start codon on the mRNA. then the next tRNA comes into the A-site, the first tRNA will move to the P-site.

hChJyYEBaa	Hypotonic: means the water is more concentrated on the outside compared to the inside. ie, there are more solutes found on the inside.<br>  <br>  Water moves from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. This can be thought of a attempt to balance out the concentrations. If this occurs over a semipermeable membrane, this is called osmosis.<br>  <br>  Animal cell: The water moves into the cell, if the concentration gradient is high (ie, there is a large difference in the concentrations of water) water will continue to move into the cell until the cellular membrane can no longer stay together and the cell bursts.<br>  <br>  Plant cell: The water moves into the cell as before, however, due to the presence of the cell wall the cell does not burst. This results in a turgid cell, and the turgidity of the plant itself (as plants do not have a skeletal system). This can be seen as if you remove a water source from a plant it wilts, as the cells are no longer turgid and cannot keep a rigid shape.|`|NIb8zWEHaa	When an animal cell or a plant cell is placed in a medium, which is a water solution , the possible consequences are listed below.<br>  <br>  1. If the water concentration of the cell?s cytoplasm is lower then that of the medium (i.e. the medium is a hypotonic solution) surrounding the cell then osmosis will result in the cell gaining water. The water molecules are free to pass across the cell membrane in both directions, but more water molecules will enter the cell than will diffuse out with the result that water enters the cell, which will then swell up and could possibly burst.<br>  <br>  2. If the water concentration inside the cell is the same as that in the surrounding medium (i.e. the medium is a isotonic solution) there will exist a dynamic equilibrium between the number of molecules of water entering and leaving the cell and so the cell will retain its original size.<br>  <br>  For example, the red blood cell in the blood plasma retains its shape because of the isotonic nature of the plasma.<br>  <br>  <br>  3. If the water concentration inside the cell is higher then that of the medium (i.e. the medium is a hypertonic solution) the number of water molecules diffusing out will be more than that entering and the cell will shrink and shrivel due to osmosis.<br>  <br>  <br>  Effects of osmosis in plant cells<br>  <br>  Plant cells are enclosed by a rigid cell wall. When the plant cell is placed in a hypotonic solution , it takes up water by osmosis and starts to swell, but the cell wall prevents it from bursting. The plant cell is said to have become "turgid" i.e. swollen and hard. The pressure inside the cell rises until this internal pressure is equal to the pressure outside. This liquid or hydrostatic pressure called the turgor pressure prevents further net intake of water . Turgidity is very important to plants as it helps in the maintenance of rigidity and stability of plant tissue and as each cell exerts a turgor pressure on its neighbor adding up to plant tissue tension which allows the green parts of the plant to "stand up" into the sunlight.<br>  <br>  When a plant cell is placed in a hypertonic solution , the water from inside the cell?s cytoplasm diffuses out and the plant cell is said to have become "flaccid". If the plant cell is then observed under the microscopic, it will be noticed that the cytoplasm has shrunk and pulled away from the cell wall .This phenomenon is called plasmolysis. The process is reversed as soon as the cells are transferred into a hypotonic solution (deplasmolysis).<br>  <br>  When a plant cell is placed in an isotonic solution, a phenomenon called incipient plasmolysis is said to occur. "Incipient" means "about to be". Although the cell is not plasmolsysed, it is not turgid. When this happens the green parts of the plant droop and are unable to hold the leaves up into the sunlight.<br>  <br>  Effects of osmosis in animal cells<br>  <br>  Animal cells do not have cell walls. In hypotonic solutions, animal cells swell up and explode as they cannot become turgid because there is no cell wall to prevent the cell from bursting. When the cell is in danger of bursting, organelles called contractile vacuoles will pump water out of the cell to prevent this. In hypertonic solutions, water diffuses out of the cell due to osmosis and the cell shrinks. Thus, the animal cell has always to be surrounded by an isotonic solution. In the human body, the kidneys provide the necessary regulatory mechanism for the blood plasma and the concentration of water and salt removed from the blood by the kidneys is controlled by a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The process of regulating the concentration of water and mineral salts in the blood is called osmoregulation Animals which live on dry land must conserve water and so must animals which live in the salty sea water, but animals which live in freshwater have the opposite problem; they must get rid of excess water as fast as it gets into their bodies by osmosis.<br>  <br>  <br>  for more see<br>  <a href="http://spmbiology403.blogspot.com/2008/08/types-of-solution-hypotonic.html" rel="nofollow">http://spmbiology403.blogspot.com/2008/0...</a>

XLVRRtBaaa	Cohesion is the bonding between the same particles (the opposite is adhesion-binding between different particles). Surface tension is created by waters natural resistence to anythin that reduces it surface area.
XLVRRtBaaa	It is dense because the polar covalent bonds that join hydrogen and oxygen are aided by the hydrogen bonds that join additional hydrogen to the negatively polar oxygen. However, keep in mind that the hydrogen bonds are continuosly broken and re-made. Interestingly, these bonds do not exist when water freezes. The molecules of H2O actually separate. Meaning that water has a higher density as a liquid than as a solid. This is why ice floats.

eebcae069679bc48e08b87150b37c89caa	Carbonation is gas dissolved in liquid. Two factors can effect the solubility of gas in liquids. These are temperature and partial pressure of the gas above the water. <br>  <br>  However as you are only looking for the effect of temperature on carbonation, gas has a limited solubility in liquids. Or, in other words, only so much gas can be put into the liquid. As solubility decreases, while temperature increases gas cannot remain in the liquid because there is simply no mechanism to hold it in suspension.<br>  <br>  Basically, cold liquids can hold more gas then hot. There is a whole nother level of understanding on it having to do with bonding between solids with differing temperatures but yeah thats pretty much it.|`|daf39013edd5f269ffb8da3637e5b361aa	Gases become less soluble in water as the temperature increases, so high temperature increases carbonation loss in soda.  You can see this very well if you open a warm soda and it foams out of the can.<br>  <br>  DK|`|AA11852174	Henry's Law states that the solubility of gases is inversely proportional to the temperature. When one goes up, the other goes down.<br>  <br>  So, when the temperature is raised, the solubility of the carbon dioxide, which makes for the carbonation or "fizziness", decrease. Less carbon dioxide, lest carbonation.
Gnfc4wRlaa	No, it won’t.  None of the claims by the doomsday prophets are based on science, just wild speculation.  The people writing the books (notably Zecharia Sitchen) aren't scientists and are just trying to make money.<br>  <br>  The Mayans didn’t predict doomsday.  It is just the end of the current cycle of their Long Count calendar.<br>  <br>  Nostradamus didn’t predict it.  He never mentioned 2012 and all the Nostradamus "quotes" being thrown around aren't what he actually wrote. They are what some people have decided that he meant. Even Nostradamus scholars don't agree on how the various centuries and quatrains should be interpreted.<br>  <br>  The Bible never mentions 2012 or references it in any way.  It talks about the end times, but there is no mention of when.<br>  <br>  Nibiru/Planet X doesn’t exist.<br>  <br>  The Sun isn’t going to be aligned with the center of the galaxy.<br>  <br>  There is no actual planetary alignment.  Sometimes the planets appear to be aligned in our view of the sky.  This is a long way from actual alignment in space.<br>  <br>  Geomagnetic reversal - These reversals of the magnetic field have occurred in the past, as shown by magnetic striping, but we can’t predict when they will occur again.  However, the time between reversals is not constant, varying from less than 100,000 years, to tens of millions of years. <br>  <br>  Although fast by geological standards, reversals are by no means quick on the human time scale. They take roughly 5,000 years, with estimates ranging from 1,000 years to 8,000 years.<br>  <br>  Solar flares – These do increase and decrease in an eleven year cycle. They haven't caused any serious problems in the past. The direct effects of solar flares are mainly related to communications and radio transmissions.

The prophecy was invented by modern woo-woos to sell books and videos.<br>  <br>  The planets will not line up with the Sun, look for the "Solar System Live site", put in any date within centuries of today and  it will show you where the planets will be.<br>  <br>  There will be no stray planets called X or Nibiru, no alignments with this or that in the galaxy, no photon belts either. All these are lies, it does not matter how many web sites or YouTube clips say these things, they are just copying each other and adding their own nonsense.<br>  <br>  What will come to an end then are these websites and clips on YouTube and books will be pulped. The History Channel will dump the rubbish 2012 documentaries on hand and start transmitting some other pseudo science material to fill the hole in their programming. <br>  <br>  By about 2018 most people will have forgotten the hysteria about 2012 and the frauds will start another end of the world scare, based this next time on Mongolian prophecy or Inuit folktales, anything that is not easily checked.

1myyubNeaa	The causes of desertification are by no means clear; overgrazing, overcropping brought about by a switch to export cropping, badly managed irrigation systems, and deforestation for firewood and timber have all been blamed, and yet some writers argue that true desertification is not occurring on a large scale (Agnew, Geography 87), and counter the claims that between 33 and 37% of the world's land surface is suffering. It may be that we are merely witnessing short-term climatic change. Others suggest that pastoral nomadism, once thought to degrade the environment, may represent the best use of desert areas.|`|WPPIaLORaa	One cause in changes in the climate that reduce rainfall.  <br>  <br>  Another is excessive grazing at the margins of the desert, a common problem in Africa.<br>  <br>  Another is changing the natural flow of rivers with dams and irrigation systems.|`|S1kYphmGaa	desertification can also be caused by circulating air flow patters of warm , moist air from the equatorial areas, raising, cooling, and condensing and returning back to the earth around the 30 degree lines of latitude.  This results in dry air pulling any existing moisture out of the air as it returns back to the equatorial regions.  This can cause deserts along the 30 degree lines.  Other possible causes are a rain shadow effect from nearby mountains, or a climate shift depriving an area of moisture, such as what caused the deserts of the south-western US.

UXf6g6Sjaa	Probably your best bet is to have somebody else manufacture it, then you do the sales. Go to an industrial design house (google a local one) to get production squared away. They will likely recommend that you produce it offshore.<br>  <br>  The hard part is sales. For this you need to do a test market, decide on what distribution channels you will use, and come up with an advertising strategy. If you want to get it carried by one of the large toy store chains, you are in for a substantial expense.<br>  <br>  All of this will cost money, of course - but you already knew that, right?<br>  <br>  If you have no experience in the toy industry, consider getting a job in the industry for a year or two.

Bd16ixUQaa	This is a classic system of equations problem.<br>  <br>  1. Write a mathematical expression for each piece of data:<br>  two times the sum of a and b equals 1236 -> 2 (a + b) = 1236<br>  twice the difference of those same two numbers (a and b) equals 680 -><br>  2 (a - b) = 680<br>  <br>  Now we have a system of 2 equations.<br>  There are two ways to solve systems of equations problems: substitution and elimination.<br>  In this problem elimination is easier so I'll solve that way first.<br>  <br>  First you have to simply each expression. Use the distributive property.<br>  2a + 2b = 1236<br>  2a - 2b = 680<br>  <br>  Now for elimination, we add the two equations together to try to get rid of one term.  In this case if we add positive 2b and negative 2b we get zero so the b term is cancelled out or eliminated, so let's do that:<br>  <br>  (2a + 2b) + (2a - 2b) = 1236 + 680<br>  Now the associative property says we can group however you want and the commutative property says we can move terms around so lets rearrange the left to look like this:<br>  (2a + 2a) + (2b - 2b) = 1916<br>  now let's simplify.<br>  4a + 0 = 1916<br>  4a = 1916<br>  Isolate a by dividing by 4 on both sides and you get:<br>  a = 1916/4<br>  simplified you get <br>  a = 479<br>  <br>  Now, take either of the two equations and plug in 479 where you see 'a' and then solve for b.<br>  <br>  Let's take the first one:<br>  2a + 2b = 1236<br>  (2 x 479) + 2b = 1236<br>  958 + 2b = 1236<br>  Solve for b.<br>  subtract 958 from both sides <br>  you get:<br>  2b = 278<br>  divide both sides by 2 to isolate b, you get:<br>  b = 139<br>  <br>  Now let's check whether it's true that a = 479 and b = 139<br>  2 (479 + 139) = 2(618) = 1236<br>  2 (479 - 139) = 2 (340) = 680<br>  <br>  Now, we could have plugged in 479 for a in the other equation of 2a - 2b = 680 and we'd have gotten the same b.<br>  <br>  Now, we could have also used the substitution method.<br>  This means for solve for any one variable in one of the equations, and plug the expression it equations in place of it in the other equation.<br>  So, we had:<br>  2a + 2b = 1236<br>  2a - 2b = 680<br>  <br>  We could have solved for a in the first equation to get (I'm not going to go through all the steps again for isolating a variable):<br>  a = (1236 - 2b) / 2<br>  Which simplifies to (although we don't have to simplify if we don't want to):<br>  a = 680 - b<br>  <br>  Now in the second equation (the one we didn't use) everywhere you see a, plug in the expression (680 - b)<br>  So, the equation we didn't use is <br>  2a - 2b = 680<br>  So, in place of a we put 680 - b<br>  2 (680 - b) - 2b = 680<br>  Now we solve for b.<br>  1236 - 2b - 2b = 680<br>  1236 - 4b = 680<br>  -4b = 680 - 1236<br>  -4b = - 556<br>  b = -556 / -4<br>  b = 139<br>  (which is also what we got using elimination)<br>  Now take either of the original equations:<br>  2a + 2b = 1236<br>  2a - 2b = 680<br>  Plug in 139 for b and solve for a.<br>  <br>  So, you see there are lots of ways to solve this.<br>  If you choose elimination, you can eliminate either a or b whichever is easier. Once you solve for the one you didn't eliminate you can plug that answer back into either original equation to solve for the other.<br>  If you choose substitution, you can take either equation and isolate either variable, a or b. You then plug the expression for that isolated variable into the equation you didn't use and solve for the variable left. Once you get one variable solved for, you can go back and plug that into either of the two original equations.|`|7qpQSk0Paa	2(n+m) = 1236<br>  2(n-m) = 680<br>  4n = 1916<br>  n = 479<br>  <br>  2m = 1236-2*(479)<br>  m = 618-479 = 139|`|cdcec5a9c09477417e887534e87f188caa	2(x + y) = 1236<br>  2(x - y) = 680<br>  <br>  Distribute:<br>  <br>  ---->  2x + 2y = 1236<br>  ---->  2x - 2y  = 680<br>  <br>  Add the two equations together, then solve for 'x':<br>  <br>  ---->  4x = 1916<br>  ---->  x = 479<br>  <br>  Plug in x = 479 in the first equation:<br>  <br>  ---->  2(x + y) = 1236<br>  ---->  2(479 + y) = 1236<br>  ---->  958 + 2y = 1236<br>  ---->  2y = 278<br>  ---->  y = 139<br>  <br>  So...x = 479 and y = 139.<br>  <br>  Plug 'x' and 'y' into the original equations to check if the answers are correct:<br>  <br>  First equation:<br>  2(479 + 139) = 1236<br>  <br>  ---->  958 + 278 = 1236 (correct)<br>  <br>  Second equation:<br>  2(479 - 139) = 680<br>  <br>  ---->  958 - 278 = 680 (correct)|`|vC4nWjQ4aa	numbers are x and y<br>  2(x + y) = 1236<br>  2(x - y) = 680<br>  <br>  distribute . . . <br>  <br>  2x + 2y = 1236<br>  2x - 2y = 680<br>  <br>  Add the two equations to get rid of the 2y, and leave it in terms of x<br>  4x + 0 = 1916<br>  4x = 1916<br>  x = 479<br>  <br>  Plug this value for x into one of the original equations<br>  2((479) - y) = 680<br>  479 - y = 340<br>  -y = -139<br>  y = 139<br>  <br>  The numbers are 479 and 139<=======ANSWER|`|ZBMWaIubaa	2(x+y)=1236<br>  2(x-y)=340           <br>  thus , divide them by 2 , getting <br>  x+y=618<br>  x-y=340   ------(1)          add all these equations getting <br>  <br>  2x=958    so x= 479 and substituting this into (1) you get y= 139.<br>  <br>  x=479 , y=139<br>  <br>  give me five bro.|`|AA11318863	the numbers are 479 and 139

The golden ratio is an irrational mathematical constant, approximately 1.6180339887.[1]<br>  <br>  At least since the Renaissance, many artists and architects have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratio—especially in the form of the golden rectangle, in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio—believing this proportion to be aesthetically pleasing. Mathematicians have studied the golden ratio because of its unique and interesting properties."|`|gTDzR23jaa	This is how to find  the golden ratio:<br>  Let's say that there is a recangle.  You know the length of all the sides.  However, long the shorter side is, you measure out that distance along  the longer side.  Then you draw a line straight down, and it makes a new, smaller rectangle on one side and a square on the other.  And, whoa!  The sides in the smaller rectangle has the same ratio as those in the larger one!  That ratio (the large side to the small side) is the golden ratio<br>  Rectangles with the golden ratio are the most pleasing to the eye, in fact, in the parthenon (a famous building in Greece) if you measure the height of the building and then the width of the front side, it makes the golden ratio!<br>  It is about 1.61803, and the equation is this:<br>  golden ratio = x/y where x/y = (x-y)/y (That's the more mathematical version of my rectangle example)<br>  Another way of saying this is: (1 + sqrt5) / 2<br>  Hope this helps!|`|i1t4Lc3Aaa	It is (1 + √5)/2 or 1.61803...<br>  <br>  Read all about it in my source below:
ZtZm4qfxaa	The word protein is derived from the greek meaning 'primary' ; proteins are the primary importance in life and the reason for DNA is to make their production possible. They allow cells to communicate and tell weather there is an infection via cell surface proteins (peripheral proteins).  The proteins ankyrin and beta spectrin are vital in keeping a red blood cell in the correct shape, biconcave. They are called structural proteins. A red blood cell can bend in and out of the smallest vessels, eg. if the red blood cell does not posses it's unique shape and therefore can not bend well it will become trapped and lyse (split and die)<br>  <br>  Maybe too much detail... I recently did a paper on hereditary diseases<br>  <br>  The hereditary disease spherocytosis causes a deficiency in either ankyrin or beta spectrin causing the  the red blood cell to deform allowing it to get trapped. with all sufferers the spleen needs to be removed (spleenomagaly) because of a build up of lysed red blood cells that release iron and haem as well as other things. It then can lead to jaundice and problems with the liver. As a result, folic acid prophylaxis needs to be taken for life...<br>  <br>  And all that caused by a deficiency of a protein!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Additional notes:<br>  <br>   I say 'primary' when i talk about proteins but equally we would be unable to exist without any other macromoleculs like lipids, nucleic acids or carbohydrates.<br>  I say 'hereditary' spherocytosis because 75% of cases have a family history and the other 25% represent new mutations where there is no family history of the disease.<br>  <br>  I hope i have shed some light on their roles.|`|mMxfVTSHaa	Enzymes- facilitate chemical reactions.

qaMPEdL2aa	The dimmer will work well for the soldering iron. <br>  <br>  It may also work for the sewing machine.  Old style electric sewing machines had only a variable resistor to control the motor speed. I would be surprised if there is not some speed control already in the sewing machine that you could use.  If you want to sew with it it really needs to be controlled by something other than your hands since sewing requires both of them to control the item being sewn.  A foot pedal or knee lever were used.

Graph that point, and do it again, this time letting x = (another number, preferably close to 'home,' in other words, 1-10).

(We've just made this seemingly impossible equation, very possible indeed.)<br>  <br>  (4 - y) - y = 6<br>  <br>  Using the distributive property, we can simplify this as follows: <br>  <br>  4 - (1)y - (1)y = 6     or    4 - 2y = 6<br>  <br>  Now it looks simple!

So the 5 inch side must also be expanded by a factor of 2 1/8 which makes it 10 5/8 inches. Answer is B.<br>  <br>  This assumes you want to keep the same aspect rato of 5:4.|`|HGb05ll0aa	The answer is B.<br>  <br>  The problem doesn't state it, but the intended answer is an enlargment with the same aspect ratio. The card has dimensions 4 x 5, the paper 8.5 by 11. To make the most enlarged version, you will have to find out which side you can max out, without going over on the other side.<br>  <br>  In other words, if you want to make the 4 inch side enlarged to the 8.5 inch side, you would multiply it by 2.125 (2 1/8). You get this by dividing 8.5 by 4. If you wanted to max out the 5 inch side, it'd be 2.2 (2 1/5); again, 11 / 5.<br>  <br>  So now you have two choices, and to keep the aspect ratio the same, you must enlarge both sides by the same amount. 4 * 2.125 = 8.5 and 5 * 2.125 = 10.625 (10 5/8). So that enlargement would be fine. However, if you tried the other one, 4 * 2.2 = 8.8 which is too big for the 8 1/2 inch paper.

If you are standing at the bottom of mount Rainer, you will feel as you did as you walked up to it.  However the higher you go the pressure changes. For instance your ears may become stuffy or your feet and hands may retain water.  The temperature will change as well. For you will find yourself getting colder and perhaps light headed and unable to think clearly. Both of these are caused because you are climbing up and hence forth your altitude is changing.  This is why people who fly from point A to point B often complain about ear aches and their shoes suddenly becomming to tight.|`|qQPxLBbcaa	While pressure does decrease consistently as altitude increases, this is not true for temperature. Temperature decreases through the troposphere going from ~15 degrees C at sea level to ~-50 degrees C at the Tropopause (15km from sea level), this level is controlled by 'greenhouse' effects. In the stratosphere Ozone heating causes a positive thermal gradient, reaching ~0 degrees C at 48km. The subsequent decrease and increases can be seen and are explained on the diagram linked below<br>  <br>  <a href="http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405101733,descCd-DOWNLOAD.html" rel="nofollow">http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/...</a><br>  <br>  download chapter 2 and refer to fig 2.5|`|n9ZuxAHkaa	ok, as you go higher and higher up, pressure decreases because there is less activity within the molicules. less activty means it's colder. but it's colder anyway because the heat is at the earths surface, it says there for a while.

A photon does have momentum, equal to Planck's constant divided by its wavelength, but given the way momentum is defined at relativistic speeds, you can't calculate a mass from that.

As far as the photon knows, it's still moving in a straight line.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  I'm not sure about Mr Wizard's answer. You can't calculate mass as he has done, by dividing the momentum by c.

For they use Euro-dollars there, right?<br>  <br>  Let me give you a basic overview on percentages.  If you want to convert a percentage into a decimal, shift the percentage symbol left two spaces.  For example: 14% in decimal form is .14 <br>  <br>  Now, how do you find the percentage of a big number like 13,000?  First of all, forget the euro-dollar sign.  We're working with only numbers here.  <br>  <br>  Simple!  You just multiply 13,000 by .14 (remember, the decimal form of 14%).  But, as you see, you must do this 3 times in a row, because it loses value every 'annum' (I don't think we call it that here in the United States =)<br>  <br>  So, the first step: 13,000 multiplied by .14 = 1,820<br>  <br>  Second step (and commonly forgotten): THIS IS NOT YOUR FINAL ANSWER!!!  You must SUBTRACT 1,820 from 13,000.  This will give you 11,180.<br>  <br>  Third step: Do it the second time (for the second annum).  This means, 11,180 multiplied by .14 = 1,565.2<br>  <br>  Fourth step: SUBTRACT 1,565.2 from 11,180 = 9,614.8<br>  <br>  You're almost there!<br>  <br>  Fifth step: 9,614.8 multiplied by .14 (again!) = 1,346.072<br>  <br>  Sixth step: SUBTRACT 1,346 from 9,614.8 to get your final answer, 8268.73<br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  If you happen to have a more advanced-level calculator, the answer may appear to be 8268.8, but you get the idea.|`|2L5uDR4Caa	vale after 1st year = 13000 x (100-14)/100<br>  =11180<br>  <br>  value after 2nd year = 11180 x (100-14)/100<br>  =9614.8<br>  <br>  after 3 years = 9614.8 x 86/100 <br>  =8263.73|`|O2xrHTVGaa	((13,000 x 86%)x 86%)x 86% <br>  = 13,000 x (86%)^3 <br>  = 13,000 x 0.636056<br>  = 8,268.728|`|0Y2HH0FEaa	14% of ￡13,000 is ￡1,820.

However when exposed to the oxygen in the atmosphere  it quickly forms aluminium oxide which is protecting it from further corrosion. That's why aluminium has a dull appearance.

Which can be shown in mirrors since the reflecting material in many mirrors is aluminium.<br>  <br>  The Works contains a lot of hydrochloric acid which has the ability to break through the protective aluminium oxide barrier.

Each method builds upon the last until we can make a pretty good estimate. Parallax is direct, based on the shift of an object against the much farther background. There are Cepheid variables that we measured using parallax which we can use to measure some of the closer galaxies. We base more distant galaxies on what we learn from closer ones, and finally we use redshift for the more distant objects. We can also use other "standard candles" such as some supernovae and globular cluster brightnesses, but you get the idea.|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	For closer objects, we can use parallax, for further objects, we can use more complex ways.

The light maybe needed about 6 billion years...<br>  <br>  Yes - that means it was emitted even before Earth was created, that is no contradiction.<br>  <br>  It was detected by the brand-new Fermi satellite. It is also a space telescope, but was designed to look for gamma rays, instead of visible light (like Hubble). <br>  <br>  Like earlier Gamma Ray telescopes, Fermi has a typical operation scheme: It is surrounded by omni directional gamma ray detectors, which notice bursts quickly and measure only their rough direction and their intensity. Fermi then quickly! turns around and points a more accurate telescope at the source of the burst and measures it, making Gamma ray images of the burst.

Just because certain cultures predict it like the Chinese, Japanese and all of them doesn't mean their predictions are correct. As I said, nobody can predict such a thing.  ? No comment will hit Earth.  ? If you have been watching the History Chanel about 2012 or anything like that, all they are just trying to do is scare people so they can make money.  ? We are going to have a rare night sky, nothing more. No asteriods, no comments, etc.    Each time the end the world is predicted. They are always wrong. Here are all the predictions of when the world would end and each time they where wrong. Every year there is a prediction like this. I'm sure that if 2012 doesn't happen, they will think of something else. Through out history the end has been predicted but has never happened.|`|rYaqoPTHaa	The basis of intelligent design      Paraphrasing the creation story and approximate history until today  (Extremely old school style)    By David Watts 2/09    (Literal) Day 1 Genesis 1:1-5 states that God created the earth.  On this first day the earth was a void in space staring at the sun.  This was not the earth we know today.  No plants and animals, a complete barren ball of water as land had not yet been introduced.    (Literal) Day 2 Genesis 1:6-8 states that God separated the waters above and below.  A shield of ice or mist was introduced into the atmosphere.  The expanse between the waters was called sky and this was the second day.  Basically, this is when He made our atmosphere.    (Literal) Day 3 Genesis 1:9-13 states that God created land and divided it from the water.  The world looked somewhat Pangea like in form, as the continents were all together.  God than created all the plant life we see today.    (Literal) Day 4 Genesis 1:14-19 states that God created the stars in the sky and the moon and set the revolution of the earth in motion around the sun.  The Earth was not capable of sustaining life before this step.    (Literal) Day 5 Genesis 1:20-23 states that God created the creatures of the sea and the air and he blessed them.  Incidentally, this is the first blessing in the Bible.      (Literal) Day 6 Genesis 1:24-31 states that God created all the land animals and than humans and gave us humans dominion over the Earth and told us to take care of it.    (Literal) Day 7 Genesis 2:1-3 states that God rested on the seventh day and made it holy as an example for us to use one day a week as a day of rest.    There was about 2000 years between the great flood when the waters above came and flooded the land and creation.  Before the flood, people lived to be several hundred years old and the differing atmospheric conditions allowed for constant growth.  As for dinosaurs, there were never any different species than what we see today.  For example, if my dog never stopped growing over his 600-year life Im sure hed be as big as a house!  These truths have often been cast aside but never disproven.    During the flood the earth below the waters broke apart creating the continents we have today.  The flood also dramatically changed the atmosphere, as there is no longer water above the earth.  The new atmosphere accounts for the differing atmospheric changes and climate we see today as before the flood the earth would have been fairly temperate.    After the flood there was 2000 years before God came to Earth in the form of Jesus.  It has almost been 2000 years since Jesus came.  His return is foretold in Revelation and many prophesies about that return are being fulfilled now.    If you have any questions about creationism please feel free to let me know.|`|sVrkjixAaa	I don't believe there will ever be an "end" to the world, not until the sun burns out. 2012 will come, some people will be freaked out, and nothing will happen.

The world will not end in 2012,  o Planet X will slam into our world and destroy us, and no rainbow lemurs from space will come and beat us to death with lazer burritos (you'd be surprised at the theories you can find on the net). Jesus is not coming back during that year, because it clearly states in the bible that we will not be able to predict his return to Earth, ever, no matter how hard we will try. Dec 12 2012 will be a regular day for the sane people, who get the kick out of watching the gullible people run around in circles screaming and hiding under their cardboard boxes with tinfoil hats on.

God Bless!|`|AA10348639	Honestly, 2012 is in three years and I highly doubt that something so catastrophic could happen in such a short amount of time. I mean there are plenty of factors that could lead to the end eventually, but not in the time being. Three years isn't that long of a time. Here is why it could happen: 7 reasons the world will end in 2012 Scientific experts from around the world are genuinely predicting that five years from now, all life on Earth could well finish. Some are saying it'll be humans that set it off. Others believe that a natural phenomenon will be the cause. And the religious folks are saying it'll be God himself who presses the stop button...1. Mayan Calendar The first mob to predict 2012 as the end of the world were the Mayans, a bloodthirsty race that were good at two things:Building highly accurate astrological equipment out of stone and Sacrificing Virgins. Thousands of years ago they managed to calculate the length of the lunar moon as 329.53020 days, only 34 seconds out. The Mayan calendar predicts that the Earth will end on December 21, 2012. Given that they were pretty close to the mark with the lunar cycle, it's likely they've got the end of the world right as well. 2. Sun Storms Solar experts from around the world monitoring the sun have made a startling discovery: our sun is in a bit of strife. The energy output of the sun is, like most things in nature, cyclic, and it's supposed to be in the middle of a period of relative stability. However, recent solar storms have been bombarding the Earth with so much radiation energy, it's been knocking out power grids and destroying satellites. This activity is predicted to get worse, and calculations suggest it'll reach its deadly peak sometime in 2012. 3. The Atom Smasher Scientists in Europe have been building the world's largest particle accelerator. Basically its a 27km tunnel designed to smash atoms together to find out what makes the Universe tick. However, the mega-gadget has caused serious concern, with some scientists suggesting that it's properly even a bad idea to turn it on in the first place. They're predicting all manner of deadly results, including mini black holes. So when this machine is fired up for its first serious experiment in 2012, the world could be crushed into a super-dense blob the size of a basketball. 4. The Bible says...If having scientists warning us about the end of the world isn't bad enough,religious folks are getting in on the act aswell. Interpretations of the Christian Bible reveal that the date for Armageddon, the final battle between Good an Evil, has been set down for 2012. The I Ching, also known as the Chinese book of Changes, says the same thing, as do various sections of the Hindu teachings. 5. Super Volcano Yellowstone National Park in the United States is famous for its thermal springs and Old Faithful geyser. The reason for this is simple - it's sitting on top of the world's biggest volcano, and geological experts are beginning to get nervous sweats. The Yellowstone volcano has a pattern of erupting every 650,000 years or so, and we're many years overdue for an explosion that will fill the atmosphere with ash, blocking the sun and plunging the Earth into a frozen winter that could last up to 15,000 years. The pressure under the Yellowstone is building steadily, and geologists have set 2012 as a likely date for the big bang. 6. The Physicists This one's case of bog-simple maths mathematics. Physicists at Berekely Uni  have been crunching the numbers. and they've determined that the Earth is well overdue for a major catastrophic event. Even worse, they're claiming their calculations prove, that we're all going to die, very soon - while also saying their prediction comes with a certainty of 99 percent- and 2012 just happens to be the best guess as to when it occurs. 7. Slip-Slop-Slap-BANG! We all know the Earth is surrounded by a magnetic field that sheilds us from most of the sun's radiation. What you might not know is that the magnetic poles we call north and south have a nasty habit of swapping places every 750,000 years or so - and right now we're about 30,000 years overdue. Scientists have noted that the poles are drifting apart roughly 20-30kms each year, much faster than ever before, which points to a pole-shift being right around the corner. While the pole shift is underway, the magnetic field is disrupted and will eventually disappear, sometimes for up to 100 years. The result is enough UV outdoors to crisp your skin in seconds, killing everything it touches.   Here is why it won't: For all those 2012 Mayan Prophecy believers out there, I have bad news. There is going to be no doomsday event in 2012!!! A calendar resets; maybe the Mayans calendar just didn't calculate past 2012!! Here's a great quote: "when a calendar comes to the end of a cycle, it just rolls over into the next cycle. In our Western society, every year 31 December is followed, not by the End of the World, but by 1 January. So 13.0.0.0.0 in the Mayan calendar will be followed by 0.0.0.0.1 - or good-ol' 22 December 2012, with only a few shopping days left to Christmas." - Excerpt from Dr Karl's "Great Moments in Science".|`|z7gLIRxfaa	There are predictions of the end, but all are unfounded.

QcR0B0j3aa	Here's an answer for your last qustion...<br>  <br>  Nephridia are invertebrate organs which function similarly to kidneys. They remove metabolic wastes from an animal's body. They are present in many different invertebrate lines. There are two basic types, metanephridia and protonephridia, but there are other types. In many earthworms the nephridial ducts open into the digestive tract instead, a condition known as enteronephry.<br>  <br>  A metanephridium (pl. metanephridia) is a type of excretory gland or nephridium found in many types of invertebrates such as annelids, arthropods and molluscs. It typically consists of a ciliated funnel opening into the body cavity or coelom connected to a duct which may be variously glandularized, folded or expanded (vesiculate) and which typically opens to the organism's exterior. <br>  <br>  A protonephridium is a network of dead-end tubules lacking internal openings. The ends are called flame cells (if cilliated) or solenocytes (if flagellated); they function in osmoregulation. The terminal cells are located in the bottom of the protonephridium. Each cell has one or several cilia and when they beat inside the protonephridial tube they create an outward going current and hence a partial vacuum in the bottom of the tube. Because of this partial vacuum waste fluids from the inside of the animal are pulled through small perforations in the terminal cells and into the protonephridium.|`|VFRXrlDVaa	Is this your homework?|`|e04025e23b950e2f3fe00c64e34a3bf1aa	i can only answer the question pertaining to Hermaphrodites - it means male and female parts are present in the same body<br>  good luck just google it

JqAckVa9aa	Polarizability does increase with mass ... as you go down a group in the periodic table. As you go across a period things are different. What is important for polarizability of neutral atoms is how tightly the valence electrons are held by the nucleus - so the trends in polarizability of neutral atoms follows the trends in atomic radius - bigger atoms are more polarizable.<br>  <br>  As you go across a period the effective nuclear charge increases and the valence electrons are held more tightly so the atom is less polarizable (atomic radius decreases). As you go down a group atomic radius increases and polarizability increases.

Apparently the top of the shelf won't cause the majority of the thought scenario. However the bottom below the water might be the reason. If the shelf breaks apart it can't fall. The moved water would be much too less to cause a tsunami (imho). If it's collapsing... , well... i don't know exactly, but i'd say to collapse... most of the ice has already been molten.

X0e6p9Ilaa	Electrical charge is not something that anything "gives off", it is something that an object simply has.  When you scuff along on the rug and then a spark jumps between you and a doorknob, it's because you had developed a charge.  You had a charge as long as there was no place for the electrons that you picked up to go.  Then you approached the doorknob the electrons jumped from you to the door.

So in an atom the proton and neutrons lies inside the nucleus where they can not leave the nucleus, while electrons are on the outer circle of the nucelus with the electron clouds. When transfering charges you can only transfer electrons to one atom to another, so you can't give off neutral charge or protons, the atoms can only receive or donate electrons.|`|yEPQO79maa	Technically speaking it doesn't actually give off a charge as it is classed as electrically neutral - it does nothing except give the nucleus it's mass, neutrons play no part in reactions (hence why isotopes of the same element react the same)|`|1DuMOwJNaa	it's neutral

0124d04ea568166ef47684e1b0bc96a0aa	3. It's all due to epigenetics. even though their genes are the same, their environments can affect the expression. Here's part of the transcript from a video i had to watch in cell biology, it's all about epigenetics and how it affect gene expressions. It's quite interesting.<br>  <br>  NARRATOR: If the epigenome controls the expression of our genes, could it solve the mystery of identical twins?<br>  <br>  These rare individuals are living illustrations of the boundary point between nature and nurture. For, since their DNA is 100 percent the same, any difference should reveal the influence of the outside world. <br>  <br>  Most identical twins appear so similar they seem the product of genes alone. Consider Javier and Carlos. Their every gesture seems the same. Or take Ana Mari and Clotilde, who show up in nearly the same red dress when, in fact, neither had a clue what the other was going to wear. They moved through life in symmetry.<br>  <br>  CLOTILDE: When I see my sister, I see myself. If she looks good, I think, "I look pretty today." But if she's not wearing makeup, I say, "My god, I look horrible."<br>  <br>  NARRATOR: But, five years ago, symmetry appeared to break. Ana Marie was diagnosed with cancer and Clotilde was not.<br>  <br>  CLOTILDE: I've been told that I am a high risk for cancer. Damocles' sword hangs over me. <br>  <br>  NARRATOR: In fact, it's not unusual for one twin to get a dread disease while the other does not. But how? How can two people so alike, be so different?<br>  <br>  Intrigued by the mystery, Spanish geneticist Manel Esteller set out, in 2005, to find the answer to that question.<br>  <br>  MANEL ESTELLER (Spanish National Cancer Center): One of the questions of twins is, "If my twin has this disease, I will have the same disease?" And genetics tell us that there is a high risk of developing the same disease. But it's not really sure they are going to have it, because our genes are just part of the story.<br>  <br>  NARRATOR: Esteller suspected epigenetics was the rest. To find out, he and his team collected cells from 40 pairs of identical twins, age three to 74.<br>  <br>  Then began the meticulous process of dissolving the cells until all that was left were the wispy strands of DNA, the master molecule that contains our genes. Next, researchers amplified fragments of the DNA, revealing both the genes and their epigenetic tags. <br>  <br>  Those that had been turned off appear as dark pink marks on the gel. Now, notice what happens when these genes are cut out and overlapped. The epigenetic effects stand out, especially when you contrast the genes of two sets of twins who differ in age.<br>  <br>  Here, on the left, is the overlapped DNA of six-year-old Javier and Carlos. The yellow indicates where their genes are functioning identically.<br>  <br>  On the right, is the DNA of 66-year-old Ana Mari and Clotilde. In contrast to the younger twins', hardly any yellow shines through. Their genome may be the same, their epigenome clearly is not.<br>  <br>  Identical genes active in one twin maybe shut down in the other. Thus, as the years pass, epigenetic changes accumulate in twins, as in the rest of us.<br>  <br>  MANEL ESTELLER: One of the main findings of our research is that epigenomes can change in function of what we eat, of what we smoke or what we drink. And this is one of the key differences between epigenetics and genetics.<br>  <br>  NARRATOR: But why does the epigenome change, when the genome does not?<br>  <br>  In Montreal, scientists Michael Meaney and Moshe Szyf believe the question contains its own answer. <br>  <br>  MOSHE SZYF (McGill University): We have this very, very static genome, very hard to change. It could be only changed by really dramatic things like nuclear explosions or, you know, hundreds of thousands of years of evolution. On the other hand, we have the dynamic environment that changes all the time. And so what there is here is an interface between the highly dynamic world around us and the highly static genome that we have. Epigenome is an in-between creature, built in a way, to respond to changes around us.|`|a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	3. environments in which they were raised were different enough to affect the expression of their genes.<br>  <br>  For example, different foods may affect hormones differently, resulting in different cellular expression of the same genes.|`|qxteTM9Kaa	3,It's a fact that most kids raised in poverty are at a disadvantage compared to other kids.|`|OXw0rv4Saa	3. environments in which they were raised were different enough to affect the expression of their genes.<br>  <br>  absolutely agree with the above comment:<br>  the foods you eat (and the amounts of those foods) as well as the nutrients and additives in the water, the sports they played growing up (which would only strengthen certain muscle groups) The amount and type of TV they watch- lots of thing can effect a person besides just their genes. <br>  <br>  As for the other answers:  for 1&2, those are NEVER the case- it's impossible because that's not how reproduction works.<br>  #4- the environment can't change the DNA you have- that's set from the day you are conceived.
uXS6b847aa	The reason it's called a "dwarf planet" because it technically is a planet, just not accepted by scientists. They don't seem to find pluto as a planet, but more as a turd of the solar system. Since it IS still part of the solar system, they decided to rename it as a dwarf planet. Hope this helped!|`|LGBNKuxRaa	so you're basically asking if dwarf planets are a subcategory of planets, or not? as currently defined, I think they could be - they are in hydrostatic equilibrium (i.e. roughly ball-shaped due to self gravity) and orbit a star but don't satisfy the 'clearing the neigbourhood' criterion. it's that last one that's new... we've had a while to sort out the 'orbits a star' thing, so we almost instinctively "know" that moons aren't planets. we might go the same way and say that ball-shaped things that haven't cleared their orbit aren't planets either.    I think sometimes we lose sight of the fact that category definitions are supposed to be useful... it's not an end in itself, debating this stuff. pluto is what it is, however it's categorised. might be hard to convince a 5 year old of that, though :)|`|6ybhTE0saa	I believe that you are right.

Astronomers have a problem with calling them all planets.  I don't know why, but they do.  If Pluto was classified as a planet then there would be literally dozens, if not hundreds of planets.  I guess that blows their minds.
kQSbBPppaa	Let the greater number be P  less= (P-6)1/3    p + 1/3(p-6) = 346  p + 1/3p - 2 = 346 --------> 1/3times p + 1/3 times -6  4/3p = 346 + 2 -----> p=1p which is 3/3p--3/3+1/3=4/3  4/3p = 348  3/4 times 4/3p = 348 times 3/4   p = 261  the greater number is 261  the less number is 261-6=255 times 1/3= 85|`|nAN7lb6Gaa	Solve by substitution means using a variable.  So lets use the variable "x".    So, let one number(the larger number) be x.  So, as the other number is 1/3 of quantity 6 less than x, it is equal to:  1/3 (x-6)    Therefore sum of the two numbers = x + 1/3(x-6) = 346....Given in the question  346 = x + 1/3 (x-6)  346 - 1/3 (x-6) = x  346 - x/3 + 2 = x  348 = x + x/3 = (3x/3 + x/3) = (3x + x) / 3  348 = 4x/3                         [ Multiplying both the sides by 3 ]  1044 = 4x                          [ Dividing both the sides by 4 ]  x = 261    Therefore the other number is 346 - 261 = 85. If you want to verify, then put the value 261 in the equation above, or better method would be to first subtract 6 from 261 and then divide it by 3:  261 - 6 = 255  255 / 3 = 85.    It satisfies our equations too. So these two are the numbers.

CYtMRC4eaa	No, it is not the same thing.     In dominance/recesssiveness, one allele will produce, say, a protein that makes flowers red (call it R), and its homologous allele will not produce it.  So any flowers that are RR or Rr will have red flowers, and any flowers that are rr will be white.    In imprinting, if the allele from the father is R and the mother's allele is imprinted, then the father's allele will NOT be expressed.

AA11432707	It depends entirely on the anesthetic.     If you are under general anesthesia, you feel nothing and remember nothing of the experience.   With a spinal or epidural, you may have some vague sensation that something is going on down there, or you may feel nothing at all (depends on the surgery and specifics of the block), but you don't feel pain.  With sedation, you might feel some pain or you might not, depending on what's being done and whether the surgeon is injecting local anesthetic or not.    In anesthesia, keeping patients pain free is a close second in importance to keeping them safe and alive, and we're usually pretty good at it.  We're also concerned with how you'll feel afterward, but pain control becomes the surgeon's responsibility once you leave the recovery room.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	If the anesthetist is any good, yes.

When u divide all terms by x^4, the only terms left are y=3/2, the rest approach infinity or zero. So y=3/4 is your horizontal asymptote. <br>  <br>  To find the vertical asymptote, find what x has to equal for y to not exist. So if u have a rational, a fraction, find the zeros (x-intercepts) of the denominator. Dividing by zero leads to infinity, so the equation will not exist at those points. <br>  <br>  For example, if u have y = X + 1 / X^2 - 5x - 6, the zeros of the denominator are x= 6 and x= -1.

It had killed around 15 sheep within two weeks. The story was only reported in 2003, and the lynx is apparently now in the possession (as taxidermy) of a collector in Suffolk. For many years this incident was considered to have been a hoax, particularly by the hunting community, But in March 2006 a police report confirmed that the case was true.

N0UUmjDlaa	I'd suggest if you want to see how it works, get a toy and pull it apart!<br>  Basically, the pullback winds a spring, like a clockwork spring. It stores the energy you impart to it by pulling it back.<br>  When you release it, the spring changes over to propel the toy forward. Either a governor or a flywheel is used to govern the rate at which the spring unwinds, so the toy will not expend all the spring energy quickly by just spinning wheels. When the spring energy is expended, the spring is decoupled from the drive, and the toy stops shortly after the forward inertia ceases. In the case of a flywheel regulated motor, a lot of the spring energy is stored in the spinning flywheel, so after the spring has released all its energy, the flywheel energy carries on until it is then expended.<br>  Yes, such a system drives wheels, so certainly circular motion is possible.

Uiab4hSaaa	The expansion or contraction of the universe depends on its content and past history. With enough matter, the expansion will slow or even become a contraction. On the other hand, dark energy drives the universe towards increasing rates of expansion. The current rate of expansion is usually expressed as the Hubble Constant (in units of kilometers per second per Megaparsec, or just per second).|`|ON7F1YRsaa	The universe is currently expanding at an accelerated rate due to something called Dark Energy. I'm not sure what the exact rate is at this point in time, but it would not be constant.|`|cJPOs7Tsaa	The answer to this question is unknown. The reason is that when we peer into deep space, we see the ancient universe as it was billions of years ago. Furthermore, all we can see is the light from the universe that is reaching us NOW. It is possible that at the outer reaches of the universe, that space is expanding at a rate faster than light. (Space can expand at any speed; objects moving through space must be slower than light). Since the expansion of space carries objects apart, then we can speculate there must be objects that are receeding from us faster than light, and therefore we can never see them.

No matter if we're talking about an isotope or a negative or positive charged atom. The ATOMIC NUMBER is always the same: the number of protons in the atom's nucleus.<br>  <br>  * The atomic WEIGHT is the average WEIGHT of an atom in twelfths of a Carbon-12 isotope. As you may know, there are different isotopes in nature, that is, atoms with the same atomic number (number of protons) but with a different number of neutrons, this gives different masses for different isotopes. And since the atomic size is so small, it would be rather impossible to measure an atomic weight with a macroscopic weight unit. It was decided to simply compare the weights of the atoms to the weight of a carbon atom with 6 protons and 6 neutrons (the 12C carbon isotope). The result is, for example, the hydrogen atom has an atomic weight that is approximately 1/12 of a carbon atom, but is not exactly the same, due to isotope averaging. It doesn't have a unit like ounces, pounds or kilograms. If want to give it a name, call it twelfths of a Carbon-12.<br>  <br>  * SUMMARY and tricks to help you remember:<br>  - Atomic NUMBER is the NUMBER of protons<br>  - Atomic WEIGHT is the WEIGHT of the atom compared to the weight of the 12C<br>  <br>  Remember, the key is in the second word: NUMBER and WEIGHT.|`|2WVFdO92aa	atomic number = number of protons<br>  atomic mass = number of protons + number of neutrons<br>  <br>  Think of H, atomic number 1<br>  It has to have at least 1 proton, so atomic number = number of protons|`|vbedfwsuaa	atomic # = # of protons= # of electrons in a neutral atom<br>  <br>  # of neutrons = mass# - # of protons|`|LWsyxuMfaa	Atomic Number = # of Protons

l0Ojx5DCaa	When you multiply two terms that have the same base, you maintain the same base but combine the exponents by addition. When you divide two terms that have the same base, you maintain the same base but combine the exponents by subtraction. So, (d^7)/(d^2)=(d^5). Or, (5)^(2n) * (5)^(n) = (5)^(2n+n) = (5)^(3n)<br>  <br>  When you multiply two terms that have the same exponent, you maintain the same exponent but multiply the bases. When you divide two terms that have the same exponent, you maintain the same exponent but divide the bases.

AA11148143	First you should know that the phrase 'survival of the fittest' does not appear in Darwin's writings. It was coined by Hobbes, an English philosopher, author of 'Leviathan.' So do not attribute it to science or scientists.<br>  <br>  Second, Hobbes did not understand what Darwin said about natural selection. He thought it had to do with teeth and claws and animals preying on each other, which has nothing to do with evolution. He was profoundly conservative, like many others who have made this mistake, and used the notion to justify free market capitalism and the corollary that poor people deserve to starve to death because they can't compete. That idea, you may notice, is still with us.<br>  <br>  As noted, most scientists would agree that there is no logical path from 'is' to 'ought' and hence no justification for social Darwinism, the monstrosity that Hobbes created and you are correct to condemn.<br>  <br>  Humanists believe that humans should be treated with respect whether or not they have soul. Ethical treatment for animals includes us, obviously.|`|AA11606721	"Survival of the fittest" has to be interpreted correctly - your interpretation is incorrect.<br>  <br>  Evolutionary fitness and "survival of the fittest" is deferential reproductive success in a given environment due to an individual's genetic disposition. It may involve weakness, if weakness helps or hinders you from reproducing AND weakness is a strongly heritable trait. It may involve intelligence if intelligence helps or hinders you from reproducing AND intelligence is a strongly heritable trait. But are weakness and intelligence strongly heritable? No. Weak people can have strong offspring; smart people can birth idiots.<br>  <br>  Population genetics shows us that trying to create a "superior" gene pool the way you describe will not work. There is no way for anyone to determine the heritable traits that our species will need to survive as our environment changes. In fact, the individual traits that seem so apparent in social exchange are linked in unimaginably complex ways to other traits that are invisible to the eye. Science tells us that any attempt along the lines you suggest will fail.|`|OXsRXLx1aa	Because we have people like you who stop us.<br>  <br>  The selfish Octuplet lady having 14 children beats even the most promiscuous couple; this means those like her will dominate the gene pool when such "giving" and "charitable" people give her the means to.)<br>  <br>  I'm a firm believer of not letting what the movie "Idiocracy" is showing is happening to the world.|`|vPqk1SGHaa	You seem to confuse two things: our understanding of how nature works with our ideals how we should act. In nature most creatures devour one another, this that not mean that we should resort to cannibalism. <br>  In addition 'the fittest' does not mean 'superior'. A flu virus is certainly 'fit' but not superior to us in any respect.|`|t5Nrj6Txaa	Show me a place or a time in history when the weakest among us have not been exploited by those with greater wealth and power.  <br>  <br>  Then we can have something to compare our existing society to for the sake of this argument.|`|40960c1c250a7d9c5f78b0b092644e29aa	No. Other than the obvious (this whole question being an example of the naturalistic logical fallacy) humans eliminating "weak" humans would be:<br>  <br>  1) Artificial selection, which has been known for thousands of years and is not Evolution by Natural Selection at all.<br>  <br>  2) Idiotic as far as out long term genetic viability goes. Genetic variability is crucial. And we aren't capable of determining which genes and gene combinations will be "fittest" in the future anyway (you seem to have totally missed the point of the statement "survival of the fittest" which doesn't refer to "strong" and "weak" but the ability of pass on genes and for those genes to survive).<br>  <br>  And 3) Utterly immoral.

cCShIyWUaa	Stop being so lazy and do your own HWK|`|3ZPYB7nxaa	////////////// here's how udo this stuff ////////////////<br>  <br>  First of all, know what a "mole" is and how chemists use it. A mole is actually just a number and chemists express weight with it. This many hydrogen atoms weighs 1 gram. This is Hydrogen's atomic weight, and can be found in a periodic table.<br>  <br>  What applies to atoms applies to molecules, too. Molecular weight is what 1 mole of a particular molecule weighs. For example, the molecular weight of the KCN in question 2 weighs the total of 1 mole of Potassium atoms, a mole of carbon atoms and a mole of Nitrogen atoms. This would be 39.1 + 12.0 + 14 = 65.1 grams/mole.<br>  <br>  Molecular weight is then used when an amount and a balanced chemical equation is given:<br>  <br>  KCN + HCl -> KCl + HCN<br>  <br>  The equation is balanced because there are equal numbers of atoms on either side of the "->" sign. What the equation is saying is that for every molecule (or mole) of KCN, a single molecule (or mole) of HCN is produced. <br>  <br>  Now, the moles of KCN = (0.320 grams)/( 65.1 grams/mole) = 0.005 moles. This will also be the number of moles of HCN produced. With a molecular weight of 1 + 12 + 14 = 27 grams/mole, 0.005 moles HCN = (.005 grams)*(27 grams/mole) = 0.135 grams HCN.<br>  <br>  Easy, no?|`|AYyLIpc1aa	for # 1<br>  <br>  Carbon<br>  <br>  4g C6H12O6 * 1mol/180g (molar mass of C6H12O6) * 6 mol C/1 mol C6H12O6 * 12g/mol molar mass of carbon)<br>  <br>  For H and O just substitute the carbon data with the appropriate data for that element.

4RJKl1aKaa	They are different quantities.  The wavelength describes the colour of the light emitted.  Unlike most other light sources lasers are highly monochromatic - that is, they emit one single colour and nothing else, as opposed to most light sources that emit a broad range of colours that only averages out to the colour you perceive.  532 nm is a good colour (it is a shade of green) because it is very close to the peak sensitivity of the human eye: that means that the beam appears brighter at that colour than an equivalent power beam at any other wavelength.<br>  <br>  The 20 and 30 mW are power ratings - how bright the beam is.  Don't pay too much attention to this figure, especially with low cost units, since the figure quoted is often more aspirational than anything else.

5W9KNNk4aa	Quick answer: it depends on your latitude<br>  <br>  Longer answer:  The Earth rotates around the sun in approximately 24 hours if you stand at the same point.  If you want to keep the sun at the same spot in the sky, you must travel around the world in that same 24 hour span.  The distance around the earth at the equator is 24,902 miles.  To travel around the earth in 24 hours at the equator is equal to traveling at :<br>  <br>  24,902 miles / 24 hours = 1,038 miles / hour<br>  <br>  The distance around the earth at a given latitude is given as the distance around the equator (24,902 miles) multiplied by the cosin of the latitude.<br>  <br>  I-80 in pennsyvlania is at approximately 41.5 degrees N latitude.  The distance at this point is:<br>  <br>  24,902 * cos(41.5) = 18,650<br>  <br>  To keep the sun in the same point in the sky, you must travel that distance in 24 hours.  It is the same as traveling the at the speed of:<br>  <br>  18,650 miles / 24 hours = 777 miles / hour|`|iuY0sIL9aa	The earth has a circumference of approximately 24,900 miles. More precisely the circumference of the earth. at the equator is 24,902 mi.<br>  <br>  Lets go with 24,900 miles.  Sun goes around earth one time in 24 hours, so it is traveling at<br>  <br>  24,900 miles/24 hours = 1037.5 miles/hour.<br>  <br>  Basically, even with latitude/season changes, you can't drive that fast.<br>  <br>  ------<br>  <br>  Here is another answer I found:<br>  How fast does the earth spin?<br>  The speed at which the earth spins varies upon your latitudinal location on the planet. If you're standing at the north pole, the speed is almost zero but at the equator, where the circumference of the earth is greatest, the speed is about 1,038 miles per hour (1,670 kph). The mid-latitudes of the U.S. and Europe speed along at 700 to 900 mph (1125 to 1450 kph).|`|O9FojdEMaa	1037.58333mph at the equator|`|g54tGcRvaa	Depends on your latitude, and season of the year.<br>  Equatorial radius = 6.4*10? m<br>  Equatorial rotation = 2π * 6.4*10? / (24*3600) m/s<br>  = 465 m/s = 1040 mi/hr<br>  Then multiply by the cosine of the latitude for local equinox terminator speed.<br>  Let's say you're about 40°N in Pennsylvania.

tU5NJVL3aa	Sorry, but you are not going to get very good answers here since we can't draw anything for you.  I'll try to describe the answer to the first question:  You've got a square with each side 60 cm.  If you were to draw a line from the mid-point of one side to the mid-point of an adjacent side, that would be one of the folds.  The other two folds are from these same points to the corner at the opposite end of the corner that is between these two mid-points.  Clear as mud, right?  Here it is again, slightly reworded -- label the four corners A, B, C, and D.  Draw a line from the midpoint of line AB to the midpoint of line BC.  Draw a line from the midpoint of AB to the corner D and another line from the midpoint of BC to corner D.  Better?<br>  <br>  [EDITED TO ADD]<br>  I knew that the folds had to be that way because it was the only way one could do three folds to create a solid... my mind just works that way.  <br>  <br>  The volume (I don't think you meant area) of a tetrahedron is given by the formula <br>  V = (1/3)(Ah)<br>  where A is the area of the base and h the height from the base to the apex.  In your situation, the little triangle is the base with an area of (30 cm)(30 cm)(1/2) = 450 cm^2, and since the height is 60 cm we can compute V = (1/3)(450 cm^2)(60 cm) = 9000 cm^3<br>  <br>  [EDITED AGAIN]<br>  Wow!  I expected at least one or two math wizards to chime in with some other info... but I guess it's not going to happen.  I'll give you a couple more hints and then stop coming back to this.<br>  <br>  The maximum volume that can be enclosed by any surface is that of a sphere, so the closer to a sphere that is formed by the net of a solid with that area, the more volume it will enclose. <br>  <br>  Lastly, since it is asking what the largest volume can be for "this area of card", and since the solid that encloses the maximum volume for a given surface area is a sphere, we have to compute the volume of a sphere with a surface area of 3600 cm^2 to get that maximum. <br>  <br>  Spherical equation for area is A = (4)(pi)(r^2), and for volume is V = (4/3)(pi)(r^3).<br>  <br>  Use the area equation (plug 3600 in for A) and solve for r, then plug that r into the volume equation for your last answer.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped!

Steam takes up vastly more space than water or ice; a little will shift and break the glass, then the drop in pressure will force the remainder to shift all at once. This will allow you to observe a very rapid shift, and also either kill or seriously maim you and any innocent bystanders. We don't normally think of water as an effective explosive but the shift to steam generates a lot of force.<br>  <br>  The surface temperature of the sun is 5,400 degrees C.

JqAckVa9aa	An equilibrium constant of 12000 means the reaction is strongly product favored. So the spontaneous direction of the reaction is toward the products - ie Delta G will be negative. Unless you know delta S for the reaction you cannot be 100% sure if delta H is also negative. However the standard conditions are room temperature so T is not so large. Probably delta H will also be negative - delta S would have to be unusually large to give a positive delta H.<br>  <br>  Finally delta G° = -RT ln K<br>  <br>  so you can calculate it from K

sXZWQRGdaa	Because thats not at all how evolution works.<br>  <br>  Evolution doesn't have an end goal.  Evolution happens because mutations happen, which changes or even adds traits to a species.  When a population of a species changes enough to not be able to interbreed with another population, a new species is born.<br>  <br>  We also did not evolve from chimps.  We share a common ancestor.  Evolution isn't linear, it branches.  One branch went to us, another went to chimps.<br>  <br>  Because of how much humans migrate making a large gene pool, because of how slowly we reproduce (compared to like, mice), changes in the gene pool don't have much effect and so there has been little changes in humans biologically throughout recorded history (about 6,000 years).  If a small population of humans became genetically isolated, then they might actually evolve into a new species in less than 25,000 years or so.|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	cause of lack of education in different places, we develop when we improve our knowledge and minds.|`|tfuPCVzOaa	Evolution is just a THEORY and has never been proved.

A good example of evolution recently happened in London where the peppered Hawk moth has evolved from its old colours resembling tree bark to a much darker almost black colour. This has happened because the trees were becoming dark due to smog hence moths this colour were less likely to be picked off by birds. The first moth to be this colour was a freak of nature but became a survivor due to the change and so bred and more of these darker moths were born. This is how evolution works.

Not saying that the kinematics solutions are wrong, this is just a different approach.<br>  <br>  The Work-Energy theorem is as follows:  Work = Change in kinetic energy<br>  <br>  If we find the initial and final kinetic energies of the train using 1/2(mv^2), we can figure out how much work the frictional force has to do on the train to slow it down. <br>  <br>  Our change in kinetic energy is Kf - Ki, or final kinetic energy minus the initial kinetic energy. Of course, we want our final kinetic energy to be zero since the train is stopped. This will give you a negative quantity as the result. This result is how much work the frictional force has to do on the train in order to stop it.<br>  <br>  The next step is to find the frictional force. The frictional force is given by F = uN where u is the coefficient of friction and N is the normal force. In this case, N = mg, where m is the mass of the train and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Force will be negative in this case, assuming the direction of motion of the train is positive, which friction acts against.<br>  <br>  Now that we know the amount of (negative) work to be done and the (negative) force due to friction, we can find the distance taken to perform this amount of work by using the equation for work, which is: W = Fd, where d is the distance. Modifying this equation, we find that d = W/F. Since we know both W and F, just plug these quantities into the equation, cancel the units, and you will end up with your distance in meters that it takes for the train to completely stop.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|20a28a16f9146e565f0d0f4721edc101aa	Frictional force = 4.8x10^4x9.8x1.5x10^-3 = 705.6 N or deceleration due to this force = 705.6/(4.8x10^4) = 1.47x10^-2 m/s^2<br>  distance, S in which the train will roll to stop is given by<br>  V^2 = 2 aS or S = v^2/2a = 20^2/(2x1.47x10^-2) = 1.36 m
Gnfc4wRlaa	A wind turbine is a rotating machine which converts the kinetic energy in wind into mechanical energy. If the mechanical energy is used directly by machinery, such as a pump or grinding stones, the machine is usually called a windmill. If the mechanical energy is then converted to electricity, the machine is called a wind generator, wind turbine, wind power unit (WPU), wind energy converter (WEC), or aerogenerator.<br>  <br>  Wind turbines are in use now.  I saw miles of wind farms when I drove through Kansas a couple of months ago.  Wind generation is a non-polluting method of generating electricity.  <br>  <br>  At the end of 2008, worldwide nameplate capacity of wind-powered generators was 120.8 gigawatts.[1] Although wind produces only about 1.5% of worldwide electricity use,[1] it is growing rapidly, having doubled in the three years between 2005 and 2008. In several countries it has achieved relatively high levels of penetration, accounting for approximately 19% of electricity production in Denmark, 10% in Spain and Portugal, and 7% in Germany and the Republic of Ireland in 2008.<br>  <br>  Wind power consumes no fuel for continuing operation, and has no emissions directly related to electricity production. Operation does not produce carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, mercury, particulates, or any other type of air pollution, as fossil fuel power sources do. Wind power plants consume resources in manufacturing and construction. During manufacture of the wind turbine, steel, concrete, aluminum and other materials will have to be made and transported using energy-intensive processes, generally using fossil energy sources. The initial carbon dioxide emissions "pay back" is claimed by one company to be within about 9 months of operation for their offshore turbines[102] and the British Wind Energy Association claim the average wind farm will pay back the energy used in its manufacture within 3 to 5 months of operation.<br>  <br>  Danger to birds is often the main complaint against the installation of a wind turbine.  However, studies show that the number of birds killed by wind turbines is negligible compared to the number that die as a result of other human activities such as traffic, hunting, power lines and high-rise buildings and especially the environmental impacts of using non-clean power sources. For example, in the UK, where there are several hundred turbines, about one bird is killed per turbine per year; 10 million per year are killed by cars alone.<br>  <br>  the wind turbines I saw were turning far too slowly to be a danger to birds.|`|pqqKLCmwaa	Wind turbines turn the unidirectional motion of the wind into rotational motion by way of blades.The rotational motion is used to drive a generator,effectively turning the kinetic energy in the wind into electricity.  The electricity can then be fed into batteries for small home sized projects , or through regulators and inverters ,into the electrical power grid.<br>     Wind power is a part of a larger plan which would include other renewable sources such as solar. Enough wind is only available in certain places.Other sites can be used for collecting solar ,geothermal, or other types of energy. Using renewable energy lessens pollution, greenhouse gasses, and will eventually make energy cheaper.  Home sized, and commercial building sized  solar or wind units would make people more independent and self reliant.|`|pBZLTc6kaa	The mechanics behind a wind turbine are fairly simple.  The wind basically turns a generator.  The blades of the turbine are spun by the wind, as the blades spin it turns a magnet inside the turbine.  A large, stationary coil of wire is around the spinning magnet.  As the magnet spins its north and south poles force electrons to move through the coil of wire.  These moving electrons are essentially electricity.  The electricity that is generated is then carried to a transformer that transforms the DC current to AC current, and is then allowed to enter the power grid that houses get energy from.  <br>  <br>  This principle, discovered by Michael Faraday, is basically how all power generation works.  Hydroelectric power, for example, works the same way except that falling water is used to rotate the magnet instead of the wind.  Also, if you have a generator and run electricity into it, it works in reverse, and the electrical current spins the magnet, and you have an electrical motor.

D5ShDa5naa	Strictly speaking, sound is not carried by any particular particle. It's effect of one particle bumping another, which bumps another, which bumps another, and so on, which creates a wave traveling in all directions. The particles would have to be so small that no matter how far they traveled, they would never travel far enough to hit the next one overthey'd have to be infinitely small, and that doesn't seem likely.

Hydrogen gas (H2 because it is diatomic) would present a very small particle comprising a gas as well as helium which is inert and travels alone.  Sound travels through a gas when something (a speaker cone?) pushes adjacent gas imparting excess energy that causes the gas molecules to push on other gas molecules forming a sound wave.  As you remove more and more gas from a vacuum chamber the gas becomes increasingly rarefied and a speaker cone imparting excess energy to a gas molecule might drive it across the chamber to the opposite wall without striking another gas molecule and no sound wave would be formed.  As you perfected the vacuum any sound waves would become weaker and weaker until there is no remaining gas medium.|`|77cb033374598e8c10938763c9fe03f7aa	The smallest particles are atoms.

Hence, all physical mass structures move in an oscillatory manner.  The phenomenon of sound is the result of consecutive atomic molecular collisions in the structure of the medium causing the motion of forces ,hence a wave.    Light micro mass particle do not move as molecular collision in a material. But rather collision with the medium of the space substance. The difference between sound waves and the motion of light is that the light particles do not touch but move sequentially at a  certain distance apart just like a wavelength and at the same speed. Both light and sound  waves require a medium in order to move.    Protons are particles that move in the solar wind, and large mass structures like the Moon and Planets disturb the Substance of Space which is the medium for moving forces ;hence form a wave called "Gravity wave" but because of its frequency we cannot hear a gravity wave.    In order to calculate the energy of a sound wave an hypothetical energy quantum of sound  ,analogous to the Photon mathematical construct  of light ,has been defined as an imaginary particle called a "Phonon"|`|MHAPOrziaa	you're right sound needs a medium to travel  It doesn't matter how large the particle is as long as its dense in an atmosphere. did you know that helium(the second smallest element) carries sound soo fast that a man might sound just like a 2 year old.  our atmosphere contains dense amount of air in which compression and decompression of molecules can take place(sound travelling) and our ear drums move because of this.  In a vacuum, there is no molecules or atoms which can be compressed or decompressed and thus our ear drums dont move so no sound is created.

Follow back with comments if you need more help.|`|FGyBCGZYaa	Raising a number to a fractional power means you are going to find a root of the number, the denominator, and raise it to a power, the numerator.  So,    (16/9)^1/2 means square root (16/9) raised to the first power  square root (16/9) = square root (16) / square root (9) = 4 / 3.  Raise 4/3 to the first power and you have 4/3.    27 ^1/3 means third root of 27, or the number you multiply by itself twice (write down three times) N*N*N= 27, N=3.  So 27^1/3 = 3.    64^2/3 can be done as third root of (64 squared) or (third root of 64) squared.  This is true of any exponent like this.  64 = 4x4x4, so the third root of 64 is 4.  4 squared = 16.  64^2/3 = 16.    As the other poster mentioned, any number raised to the 0 power is 1.

65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	To calculate Young's Modulus, you need the stress in the sample, and the strain (change in length divided by original length).    I think the hardest part of this will be the stress, how will you determine the cross sectional area of the strips?    The easiest way I can think of is to hang the strip vertical and attach a known weight and measure how much it stretches.  On each end of the strip, use something like those black plastic binder clips to hold it, and hang the strip from something solid by the metal prongs of the clip, and also hang the weight on the other end from the prongs.  This would allow you to avoid any problems caused by punching a hole in the strip to hang it from (the stress at a hole is much higher and will mess up your results).    Before hanging it, mark intervals on it, being as exact as you can.  Do this in the units you'll be using (I'd suggest marking off 1 cm intervals).  With the weight hanging, you can measure between the marks and see how much that interval stretched.    Then calculate:  stress = force/cross sectional area (area will be small, bag is very thin, might be able to use very precise calipers to measure)    strain = change in length / original length (length between marks)    young's modulus = stress/strain    I hope this helps, or at least puts you on the right track!

AA10929714	For part (a), you are supposed to plug the proposed solution into the differential equation and show that the equation is satisfied for certain values of k.    If y = sinh(k*t),    y' = k*cosh(k*t)    y'' = k^2 * sinh(k*t)    Plugging y and y'' into the original differential equation results in the characteristic equation:    k^2 - 25 = 0    k = +5 and k = -5    (k = 0 is also a solution, but this is the "trivial" solution, i.e., y(t) = 0)    -------    For (b), do a similar thing.  This time, take the second derivative of the solutions:    y = A*sinh(5t), y = A*sinh(-5t), y = B*cosh(5t) and y = B*cosh(-5t),    Plug them into the original differential equation along with the appropriate version of y, and show that the equation is satisfied.    --------------------------------    (c)  If y = sin(k*t), then y' = k*cos(k*t) and y'' = -k^2 * sin(k*t) = -(k^2)*y    Look for a differential equation of the form:    y'' + a*y' + b*y = 0     that is satisfied by the above solution.     Plug the derivatives into the differential equation and solve for a and b in terms of k.  (We'll set k = 5 and -5 in the next step to get actual numerical values for a and b):    -(k^2)*sin(kt) + a*k*cos(k*t) + b*sin(k*t) = 0    For this equation to be true for all values of t, the cosine term must always be zero, so b = 0.  After dividing through by sin(k*t), we have:    b - k^2 = 0    b = k^2    In our case, k = +/-5, and k^2 = 25, so the solution that satsfies the differential equation is:    y'' + 25y = 0

dCzoIUP7aa	When thinking of building a wheelchair ramp for your business or home one must consult the Americans with Disabilities Act for guidelines on building the proper wheelchair ramp. These guidelines are called the ADA Standards for Accessible Design and can be found here http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada/stdspdf.htm... The Federal minimum requirements for wheelchair ramps are as follows.     1. The maximum slope of the ramp is one inch of rise for  each linear foot of run. (one inch rise in 18 inches of run  will better assist the elderly)    2. The minimum clearance between handrails is  36 inches. (42 inches recommended)    3. The maximum rise for any ramp segment is 30 inches.  After 30 inches of rise a flat rest platform must be  provided. The platform must be as wide as the ramp and  a minimum of 60 inches in length.    4. A flat landing must be at the bottom and top of all ramps    5. Handrails/Guardrails must be on each side of the ramp  and landings. Rails must be at least 30 inches above the  ramp and no more than 38 inches above the ramp,  measured Vertically    These Federal guidelines are the main standard and all encompassing but your local and State wheelchair ramp building codes must be checked for any additions to the Federal standard.    Or you can get a portable one at:  http://www.google.com/products?hl=en&q=w...

iHSDSPrhaa	Definitely NOT impossible Sargosis!<br>  <br>  It is exactly the same principle as two healthy parents having a child with cystic fibrosis. Both the mutation that causes CF and the blue eye allele are recessive. This means that if you carry both the dominant brown-eye allele and the recessive blue then you will have brown eyes but can still pass the blue-eye allele to your child. In order for two brown-eyed parents to have a blue-eyed child they must both carry the blue-eye allele. So as someone above said they must both be Bb.<br>  <br>  If this is the case then EVERY time they have a child there is a 1 in 4 chance that it will have blue eyes. So although it is unlikely, it is not impossible. Just like throwing three 6s with a dice in a row is unlikely but not impossible.<br>  <br>  To get three blue-eyed children the probability would be 0.25 x 0.25 x 0.25. Which works out at (0.015625) 1 in 64. Much better odds than wining the lottery!<br>  <br>  x|`|m18scL37aa	Completely possible although the odds would have been against all three having them. <br>  <br>  Eye colour like hair colour is decided by a combination of two genes. <br>  <br>  Brown is represented by a B and is the dominant gene <br>  <br>  Blue is represented by a b and is a recessive gene<br>  <br>  you also have green in there too somewhere but I can't remember its exact details. <br>  <br>  So imagine the family your thinking of <br>  <br>  Mum and Dad have Brown eyes so they have a dominant brown gene but as the children have blue eyes both parents must carry the blue recessive gene giving both parents a Bb combination. The combinations their children could have had are BB Bb Bb bb giving their children a one in four chance of inheriting blue eyes. <br>  <br>  Hope that makes sense to you some how, it can be quite confusing to explain but pretty interesting when you get to grips with it. <br>  <br>  You have no need to worry though it's all very possible so no need to go starting those affair roomers.|`|efzoxU0uaa	dnt listen to who says its impossible,have anyone else in your family tree got blue eyes?den its possible its the same in my family, both my parents have brown eyes i have hazel eyes my we bro has brown eyes n my older bro has blue eyes|`|MUIEn7RWaa	it isnt impossible... has any of your other relatives got blue eyes or had blue eyes?<br>  both my parents have brown hair and they had five children; one turned out ginger, one turned out blonde, one turned out auburn and im the only one who turned out brunette.|`|GxapFaqtaa	Have a DNA test, Something wrong there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you owe it to the child or the child may get you back when they are older.<br>   My cousin hates both his parents and no one talks to them now.|`|339NqJ84aa	Must be the milk mans kids :)|`|6T9fpKiVaa	mmhhh. idk if its IMpossible bit idrk.

Blue is the most common eye colour and is not dependant on genealogy.<br>  <br>  However it is worth looking to see what coloured eyes the postman has.|`|0iTNDPzoaa	It is very common. You can carry the gene for blue eyes and this can results in some siblings having blue and some with brown. It has to do with probability that all the children have blue eyes and not impossible.|`|715f8a57435bf66b324f94e65dec6359aa	Sargosis is completely wrong - he/she has totally misunderstood the point of recessive genes.<br>  <br>  You have two genes for each trait, one inherited from the mother, and one from the father. In the case of blue/brown eyes, the gene for brown eyes is dominant, which means that if you have one gene for brown and one for blue, you will have brown eyes. <br>  <br>  However, this means you can have brown eyes and still be a carrier for the blue-eyed gene. If both the father and the mother are carriers, then on average one child out of four will have blue eyes. This is because the children could inherit one of four possible combinations of brown (B) and blue (b) genes:<br>  BB - brown<br>  Bb - brown<br>  bB - brown<br>  bb - blue<br>  <br>  So, for all 3 children to have blue eyes is pretty unlikely, but certainly not impossible.|`|ef781bf475a2f0b25dfeb4116db82bd3aa	Actually, genetically it's impossible. One of you is cheating on the other.<br>  <br>  Ahem...allow me to add clarity:<br>  Brown eyes are a genetically dominant gene. If both parents have brown eyes, then there are only very specific combinations that can occurr, and it's almost always the crossing of the dominant traits. <br>  <br>  If both parents have dominant brown-eyes, then it's not possible for even 1 (let alone 3) genetic recessive-recessive mixes to occur.|`|DoHaUEziaa	I don't know how well you know your neighbors, but is it possible they could've adopted them? Also, the grandparents could have blue eyes. Regardless, I'm not sure what the point is other then curiousity. As long as they are all healthy and happy. That's pretty much all that matters.|`|JC9F4C2Taa	Blue eyed genes are recessive, only two blue genes together will produce blue eyes. If just one brown gene shows up, then the eyes are brown. So:<br>  <br>  blue + blue = blue<br>  blue + brown = brown<br>  brown + brown = brown<br>  <br>  Both parents have a 50-50 chance of either gene showing up in a child

And that would be hard, without allowing Doppler Shift. <br>  <br>  It is perfectly a 3000K temperature spectrum, extremely red-shifted so it's peak is now at 2.9K. This temperature of 2.9K is also one of the reason which delayed it's discovery: How large the early universe was, was not known then until this uniform background radiation was finally found, but with this measurement, you can calculate this and you can also deduct small mass concentrations in the early universe from small variations in the temperature. <br>  <br>  This is all something, which the Big Bang theory can explain in a reproducible way. You can test it. Your theory would have to explain the same measurements and survive similar hard tests. The Big Bang theory was initially fought hard, because it countered scientific doctrines and was considered creationism.|`|YfkkpDpAaa	The "big Bang" a load of cr@p .

With respect to red shift, the scientific community behaves like a police department that has a likely suspect in custody and political pressure to get a quick conviction. Anyone who offers an alternative red-shift theory is denied government grants, barred from publishing in peer-review journals and branded as a crazy, radical pseudo-scientist. The scientific establishment is more interested in protecting the incomes, reputations and social standings of its members than in discovering the truth. <br>  <br>  The very nature of cosmology is such that all cosmologies, including Big Bang, are unprovable. Therefore, the whole subject of cosmology is more a matter of religion than of science, and the present situation amounts to an unconstitutional establishment of religion. <br>  <br>  No; I am not a creationist, either. I have to agree with the arguments of "intellegent design" advocates regarding the conspiracy to suppress ALL heretical ideas, not just their own. The methods used to suppress intelligent design are used just as effectively to suppress all alternatives to Big Bang. <br>  <br>  2. Newtons universal "law" of gravitation became law because it passed all laboratory tests. It was then presumed to prevail outside the laboratory, as well. It still appears to work at distances up to the limits of paralax (several parsecs). Beyond that, we have observed that galaxy rotation curves do not agree with the law of gravitation. Instead of looking for flaws in the law, we invent dark matter to preserve the law. <br>  <br>  Some rogue scientists have proposed that the speed and range of gravity may be finite, whereas the law of gravitation (and general relativity) tacitly presumes that both are infinite. I believe that, if gravity's range is less that width of a galaxy, the modivied law of gravity would tend to require more dark matter, not less. However, a speed of gravity of 25 billion times the speed of light would mean that stars 50,000 light years from the center of a galaxy would be pulled toward where the galactic center was about a minute ago. I'm no mathematician, but I think this would tend to flatten the predicted rotation curve.|`|aSTmFCiBaa	messrs penzias and wilson did some work for california telephone co detected a three degree kelvin microwave rf that interfered with phone lines causing static,in like 1964,,the source is in the sky,,,,,,360 degrees in all directions,,,this bit of background radiation is the residue of the big bang,they had to clean out pigeon poop that perhaps was causing the static,,,yuck,,,real dedicated fellas
4uf044sFaa	I agree with the guy above me 100%.  Forecasting exactly how much snow will fall on a given area is the most difficult thing to do and nearly impossible.  You can have a heavy pocket of snow over a area that might dump 2 to 3 inches in an hour, and the county just ten miles away might be under the lighter bands and may just get a dusting.  I understand what you are saying, and it does get frustrating when they predict so much snow, and you go out and get things you need to prepare by spending $50, and you get no snow.  <br>  <br>  That actually happened to me a few weeks ago.

Weather forecasts have substantially improved over the last 15 years, but forecasting how much snow is going to occur is very difficult. One problem is that the same amount of rain can make vastly different amounts of snow, depending on the type of snow: wet, fluffy, powdery, etc.  Usually people say that 1 inch of rain makes 10 inches of snow, but it can vary from 4 inches of snow to 50. Even forecasting the amount of rain is one of the more difficult things to do, but even if they get that right they may get the snow off completely.|`|yyvcryrbaa	the take the computer too seriously.|`|JoWF6YQRaa	global warming

A coastline of zero indicates that the country is landlocked.<br>  <br>  The coastline paradox states that a coastline has no single fixed length. Measurements of the length of a coastline behave like a fractal, being different at different scale intervals (distance between points on the coastline at which measurements are taken). The smaller the scale interval (meaning the more detailed the measurement), the longer the coastline will be.[1] This 'magnifying' effect is greater for convoluted coastlines than for relatively smooth ones. For example, as seen on satellite image websites, the length of Canada's very convoluted coastline at a scale interval of 500 km is only about 20,000 km, less than a tenth of the value given in the table. On the other hand, Australia's coastline at 500 km intervals is about 12,500 km, around half the value in the table.[2]<br>  <br>  The coast/area ratio measures how many meters of coastline correspond to every square kilometer of land area. The ratio illustrates the ease of accessibility to the country's coast from every point in its interior. Therefore, an island country like Maldives, or a country carved by the sea like Greece, is more likely to have a high ratio, while a landlocked country like Austria will have a ratio of zero.<br>  <br>  Note that the scales at which the CIA World Factbook figures were measured are not stated, nor is it known whether the figures are all reported using the same scale. The figures are not necessarily comparable across different countries.<br>  Rank  ↓  Country  ↓  Land area[3]<br>  (km2)  ↓  Coastline[4]<br>  (km)  ↓  Coast/Area Ratio<br>  (m/km2)  ↓<br>  &0000000000000001.0000001   Canada  &0000000009093507.0000009,093,507  &0000000000202080.000000202,080  &0000000000000022.22200022.222<br>  &0000000000000002.0000002   Indonesia  &0000000001826440.0000001,826,440  &0000000000054716.00000054,716  &0000000000000029.95800029.958<br>  &0000000000000003.0000003   Greenland  &0000000002166086.0000002,166,086  &0000000000044087.00000044,087  &0000000000000020.35300020.353<br>  &0000000000000004.0000004   Russia  &0000000016995800.00000016,995,800  &0000000000037653.00000037,653  &0000000000000002.2150002.215<br>  &0000000000000005.0000005   Philippines  &0000000000298170.000000298,170  &0000000000036289.00000036,289  &0000000000000121.706000121.706<br>  &0000000000000006.0000006   Japan  &0000000000374744.000000374,744  &0000000000029751.00000029,751  &0000000000000079.39000079.390<br>  &0000000000000007.0000007   Australia  &0000000007617930.0000007,617,930  &0000000000025760.00000025,760  &0000000000000003.3810003.381<br>  &0000000000000008.0000008   Norway  &0000000000307442.000000307,442  &0000000000025148.00000025,148[5]  &0000000000000081.79800081.798<br>  &0000000000000009.0000009   United States  &0000000009161923.0000009,161,923  &0000000000019924.00000019,924  &0000000000000002.1750002.175<br>  &0000000000000010.00000010   New Zealand  &0000000000268021.000000268,021  &0000000000015134.00000015,134  &0000000000000056.46600056.466<br>  &0000000000000011.00000011   People's Republic of China  &0000000009326410.0000009,326,410  &0000000000014500.00000014,500  &0000000000000001.5550001.555<br>  &0000000000000012.00000012   Greece  &0000000000130800.000000130,800  &0000000000013676.00000013,676  &0000000000000104.557000104.557<br>  &0000000000000013.00000013   United Kingdom  &0000000000241590.000000241,590  &0000000000012429.00000012,429  &0000000000000051.44700051.447<br>  &0000000000000014.00000014   Mexico  &0000000001923040.0000001,923,040  &0000000000009330.0000009,330  &0000000000000004.8520004.852<br>  &0000000000000015.00000015   Italy  &0000000000294020.000000294,020  &0000000000007600.0000007,600  &0000000000000025.84900025.849<br>  &0000000000000016.00000016   Brazil  &0000000008456510.0000008,456,510  &0000000000007491.0000007,491  &0000000000000000.8860000.886<br>  &0000000000000017.00000017   Denmark  &0000000000042394.00000042,394  &0000000000007314.0000007,314  &0000000000000172.254000172.254<br>  &0000000000000018.00000018   Turkey  &0000000000770760.000000770,760  &0000000000007200.0000007,200  &0000000000000009.3410009.341<br>  &0000000000000019.00000019   India  &0000000002973190.0000002,973,190  &0000000000007000.0000007,000  &0000000000000002.3540002.354<br>  &0000000000000020.00000020   Chile  &0000000000748800.000000748,800  &0000000000006435.0000006,435  &0000000000000008.5940008.594<br>  &0000000000000021.00000021   Federated States of Micronesia  &0000000000000702.000000702  &0000000000006112.0000006,112  &0000000000008706.5530008,706.553<br>  &0000000000000022.00000022|`|rOY2J0UAaa	Canada<br>  Indonesia<br>  Greenland<br>  Russia<br>  Philippines<br>  Japan<br>  Australia<br>  Norway<br>  United States<br>  New Zealand<br>  China<br>  Greece

It specifically damages certain brain cells, possibly causing memory problems, confusion, depression, sleep problems, anxiety, and paranoia. There are, of course, other effects on other parts of the body, but the problem with injuring the brain is that the lost brain cells do not grow again or get replaced. It is not really worth it.|`|lhB213Imaa	It depends on the dose.  A high dose will cause more intense signaling in the brain which can be neurotoxic.

AA12350771	OK, starting with 6). You have 2 angles in the triangle - 65° and 82°. So the other angle is 33° (has to add up to 180°). 6) + 33° has to add up to 180°, so 6) = 147°<br>  <br>  4) This is on a straight line so the 3 angles have to add up to 180°.<br>  So 70° + 65° + 4) = 180°, so 4) = 45°<br>  <br>  5) We have 45° as one of the angles. The other angle is 180° - 118° = 62°. The last angle has to make the triangle add up to 180° so:<br>  180° - 45° - 62°= 73°<br>  <br>  3). We know 4) is 45°, so 3) = 180° - 45° - 70° = 65°<br>  <br>  2). The unmarked angle in this triangle = 36° as the angle crosses another line. We know 3) = 65°, so:<br>  2) = 180° - 65° - 36° = 79°<br>  <br>  1). We have the 2 other angles of the triangle: 68° and 36°. Therefore the remaining angle in the triangle is 76°.<br>  1) = 180° - 76° = 104°.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope I explained this clearly enough!|`|DSTBzLFOaa	Finding Angle One<br>  All angles of a triangle must add up to 180 degrees.  Since you already know 68 and 36, you add them up and then subtract that number from 180.  That gives you the angle adjacent to angle one.  It is 76.  Angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees, so you subtract the angle adjacent to angle one from 180 and you get angle one.  When you subtract 76 from 180 you should get 104 degrees.  That is the measure of angle number one.<br>  <br>  Finding Angle Four<br>  Before you can find angles 2 and three, you need to find 4.  The two angles adjacent to angle 4 are 70 and 65.  It is a straight line, so again, it must add up to 180.  Subtract 70 and 65 from 180.  That will give you angle 4.  You should get 45.  <br>  <br>  Finding Angle Three<br>  Before you can find angle two, you need to find angle three.  You know that angle 4 is 45, so you just subtract both that 45 and the 70 beside angle 3 and it should give you angle 3 because all three of the angles are on a straight line and need to add up to 180.<br>  <br>  Finding Angle Two<br>  Now that you have 3, angle 2 will be easy.  You want to try to find all the angles in the triangle that angle 2 is in.  You know angle 3, so all that you need is the third angle.  You know what the other angle is because it is opposite of the 36 that is given to you.  Opposite angles are equal.  Now that you have both angles, you can find angle 2 by subtracting the 36 and the angle 3 (65) from 180 and you will get angle 2.<br>  <br>  Finding Angle 5<br>  Finding angle 5 is simple.  You simply do what you did to find angle 2.  Find all the angles in the triangle where angle 5 is except for angle  5. It gave you 118 on the far right side, so you know that the angle beside it is 180-118.  You should get 62.  You already know angle 4 (45).  Subtract both 45 and 62 from 180 and you will get your angle 5.<br>  <br>  Finding Angle 6<br>  To find angle six, you need to find the angle beside it.  To find the angle beside it, you need to find all of the angles in that triangle.  You already know the angles because they are given.  Subtract both of them from 180.  You should get 33.  Now subtract 33 from 180 to find angle 6.  You should get 147.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

My way to make sense of the confusion is to remember that I don't have all the answers and I can't comprehend what God does.<br>  My question is why do religion and evolution have to be rivals?<br>  If the earth was created in 7 days, who's to say God's "day" is the same as our 24 hour schedule? And who is to say that God didn't create man through evolution? If I'm remembering my scripture correctly it says man was created from dirt and God's blood.

To be honest with you, those who believe in evolution have set it in their hearts almost AS a religion and arguing against it is like arguing against someone's faith.  You won't get very far.<br>  <br>  But as far as being convinced yourself?  Consider this: Scientists have developed a field of study they call "bio-engineering".  In this field, they examine works of nature (created things) and develop machines or tools or items than mimic the properties of the things in nature.  For instance they examine things like a gecko's feet.  A gecko can climb anything (except for I think teflon).  His little feet grip in a very unusual way.  Or they might examine how a particular fish slips through the water with very low drag (a boxfish for instance) and then design a car that is able to slip through the air based on the same ideas.<br>  <br>  Or they might examine how a hummingbird flies and figure out how to make a helicopter from what they have learned.<br>  <br>  Throwing out all theories, all preconceived ideas, and just using logic, does it seem logical to YOU, that man has to first examine these things, then figure out how they work, then get a team of engineers together to design and emulate them to create a poor copy of the original, but the original needed NO designer? that it all happened just by accident?<br>  <br>  There is wisdom evident in the created things.  There is balance and organization and knowledge evident in the way things grow, in the way animals and birds care for their young, in the way some animals are so well adapted to their environments.  There are marvels to be learned from nature and the natural world.  How logical is it REALLY to assume it was all a colossal accident?<br>  <br>  Go in the kitchen, pour yourself a glass of tomato juice and then drop the glass and shatter it all over the kitchen floor.  THAT is an accident.  Then examine the mess and see if you can find any order or meaning or anything of value in what is there on the floor.<br>  <br>  You might find some evidence of external forces at work on the glass. How gravity made it fall, or how at the point of impact it spread out in all directions around it, but beyond these obvious things, what sort of order are you going to find in the chaos of the broken glass and juice?<br>  <br>  Not much.  Accidents don't create highly complex and organized systems.  You aren't going to find a new way to do anything from that broken glass.  You aren't going to learn how to develop a box fish shaped car, or a helicopter, or how to make velcro (from observing burrs) or how to climb walls like a gecko.  All you are going to find is a big mess you now need to clean up.<br>  <br>  If the world got here by accident, there would be NO organized or complex systems about it.  There would simply be chaos.<br>  <br>  Anyone who believes otherwise really isn't using any sort of logic.  They are just putting faith in a different sort of "god" because they don't want to believe in an idea of intelligent design.<br>  <br>  The thing about Darwin and his "theory?"  He assumed that there were "simple" life forms for more complex ones to develop from.  What he thought of as "simple" in his day has been proven to be vastly more complex than was previously imagined.  Even single celled creatures are highly complex.|`|E1DOJj67aa	To refute it you would have to demonstrate that changes to an animals environment *do not* lead to the selection of creatures with specific characteristics.<br>  <br>  But you've got a problem there.<br>  <br>  Science *has* seen selection of certain genotypes as a result of environmental changes.  We see the rising prevelance of bacteria that are resistant to anti-biotics - the population of bacteria is reacting to a change in their environment, namely our use of antibiotics.<br>  <br>  So at the cellular level even this trivial example shows that evolution occurs.<br>  <br>  This is not refutable. <br>  <br>  Unless one were to imagine that a deity has spontaneously caused a new form of life to arise with characteristics that are better fitted to an environment. That's evolution by proxy though.<br>  <br>  >Also could some of the edvidence be simply a hoax?<br>  <br>  The nature of science is that hoaxes are slowly but surely weeded out of the pool of ideas. If it cannot be replicated by other researchers, then any finding is suspect and gets, ahem, deselected from the next generation of ideas.<br>  <br>  This is why science works so well - it's not quick, it's not 100% accurate, but it doesn't need to be. Bad ideas (those that make untestable predictions, or those that turn out to be incorrect) get pushed aside by ideas which *do* make testable predictions and which do turn out to fit reality well.<br>  <br>  Evolution is the best model we have to explain the proliferation of life on this world.<br>  <br>  Find another model, one that makes testable predictions, and see if those predictions are accurate.<br>  <br>  If you cannot do this then you cannot overturn the status quo.|`|mRG0W5Yxaa	Well, it's not a matter of faith or belief; if you can develop a model that explains the way the world works better than evolutionary theory does, and if rigorous testing over a hundred years or so doesn't disprove it, we'll all sign on.  Science is like that, although usually there's a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth before everybody finally comes to accept the more likely theories.  If you just don't like the implications that you believe evolutionary theory comes with, though, then your job is easy - you just say "I refute the theory of evolution", and you're done.  Of course, not too many people are likely to accept your refutation, but there it is.  You'll be satisfied, and that's what counts.<br>  The problem with science is that it's rarely, if ever, definite about anything; we're talking degrees of confidence.  I'm pretty certain that the sun is going to come up tomorrow, and even that it will rise in the east, but I'm not absolutely certain; too many things could conceivably happen, from the sun suddenly going out or blowing up unexpectedly to the Earth's rotation changing.  The chance of any of those things happening is pretty darned minuscule, based on what we know about the Universe, but we can't completely rule out stuff just because we don't think it's likely.  Of course, if any of those things did happen, we probably wouldn't be in a position to really care much about being wrong about the way the universe works.  Science predicts that certain things will happen based on what we know and what we have seen, but there's always a little room left for things that we may not yet have noticed or not have fully understood.<br>  I'm sorry about your doubts, I really am, but science is not the place to resolve them; all we can do is say "As best we know, this is how things work."  If you want absolute certainty, you have to go to faith.  Of course, you can easily be absolutely certain about something and still be completely wrong.  I still think that humanity shows that God has a rather mordant sense of humor.<br>  PS - if you really want to refute evolutionary theory, you would be well-advised to learn about it.  A good grounding in biology would be a minimum: I'd recommend a BS followed by at least a few graduate-level courses in evolutionary biology, and maybe some paleontology thrown in.  It also wouldn't hurt to get some zoology under your belt, plus some taxonomy, botany usually helps, and don't forget to get a good basic grounding in microbial biology.  Also, everybody should have at least one good basic course in Ecology.  Just for general living, I'd strongly recommend a course in logic (it really helps you deal with advertising and politics, too, trust me) and maybe a basic course in statistics.  Once you've got that squared away, then refute to your heart's content.  I'll be most interested to see what you come up with (and I mean that most sincerely)!

The mass of the Earth atmosphere is 5.14×1018 kg [17], so the total mass of atmospheric carbon dioxide is 3.0×1015 kg (3,000 gigatonnes). Its concentration varies seasonally (see graph at right) and also considerably on a regional basis: in urban areas it is generally higher and indoors it can reach 10 times the background atmospheric concentration.<br>  <br>  Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. See greenhouse effect for more.<br>  <br>  <br>  Due to human activities such as the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation, and the increased release of CO2 from the oceans due to the increase in the Earth's temperature, the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased by about 35% since the beginning of the age of industrialization.[2] In 1999, 2,244,804,000 (=~2.2×109) metric tons of CO2 were produced in the U.S. as a result of electric energy generation. This is an output rate of 0.6083 kg (1.341 pounds) per kWh.[19]<br>  <br>  Five hundred million years ago carbon dioxide was 20 times more prevalent than today, decreasing to 4-5 times during the Jurassic period and then maintained a slow decline until the industrial revolution, with a particularly swift reduction occurring 49 million years ago.[20][21]<br>  <br>  Up to 40% of the gas emitted by some volcanoes during subaerial volcanic eruptions is carbon dioxide.[22] According to the best estimates, volcanoes release about 130-230 million tonnes (145-255 million tons) of CO2 into the atmosphere each year. Carbon dioxide is also produced by hot springs such as those at the Bossoleto site near Rapolano Terme in Tuscany, Italy. Here, in a bowl-shaped depression of about 100 m diameter, local concentrations of CO2 rise to above 75% overnight, sufficient to kill insects and small animals, but warm rapidly when sunlit and disperse by convection during the day[23] Locally high concentrations of CO2, produced by disturbance of deep lake water saturated with CO2 are thought to have caused 37 fatalities at Lake Monoun, Cameroon in 1984 and 1700 casualties at Lake Nyos, Cameroon in 1986.[24] However, emissions of CO2 by human activities are currently more than 130 times greater than the quantity emitted by volcanoes, amounting to about 27 billion tonnes per year.[25]|`|EMC7JwVBaa	There are over 6 billion of us.

Here′s how I would go about it:<br>  <br>  Turn on the oscilloscope. Adjust intensity. Check triggering mode, source, level and coupling. Usually you would want A triggering, ch1 or ch2 triggering. AC-coupling and auto level triggering. Once you've have a sweep running from left to right you can fine tune intensity and focus of the beam and the horizontal position of the trace. The vertical position is adjusted for the separate input channels. Sometimes you′ll need to adjust the tilt of the line with a small screwdriver. Now connect your probe to the calibration output (if it′s an x10 probe) and adjust sweep time and input range so that the square wave can be seen. Adjust the probe with a small screwdriver so that the displayed square wave has as square edges as possible.<br>  <br>  Now you can connect the probe to the thing you want to measure and adjust sweep time, input range offset and triggering level so the signal can be clearly seen.<br>  <br>  On modern digital oscilloscopes there′s an auto-button that greatly simplifies this procedure. Simply connect the probe to the thing you want to measure and press the auto button.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	I've used a half dozen different models over the course of 30 some years.

Good luck.|`|0bff81ed3d62dee95cf8cc2a3daa55a4aa	A simple (but inaccurate) approach would be to take the diameter of a tennis ball (about 3") and pretend it's in the shape of a 3x3x3 cube.  So 8 balls would fit along one side of the box, and therefore the box would hold 8x8x8 cubes, or 512 cubes.  Then you use that as your answer.  In practical terms, that would mean stacking the second layer of balls directly on top of the first, which would be very difficult unless you put a layer of cardboard or thin plywood between each layer.  The reason is that as you placed the second layer, the balls would want to settle into the spaces between the balls in the first layer.  You would get fewer balls in the second layer, but because they're sitting a bit lower in the box, you could get more layers into the box.  The third layer would be identical to the first layer, and so on until the box is full.  Calculating the number of balls in the box would be quite tricky - you could probably load the box for real faster than you could calculate the number on paper.|`|MuzqSYjwaa	assuming the balls have a 3" diameter.  Then its obvious that 512 would fit if they were neatly stacked on top of each other, and if the balls filled all the space available then about 1467.5 would fit.

I guess it would depend on how human the humanzee's brain was.  Another huge problem would be vocal cords.  Humans have unique throats and vocal cords compared to other animals.  Chimps have vocal cords that are located higher than humans and they are therefore unable to talk.  If there was a humanzee, then maybe its vocal cords would be more like a human's and it could talk.  I suppose if they were somehow able to make a humanzee it might be able to talk! haha.

However (there had to be a catch, right?), some zebras are born with genetic variations that make them all black with white stripes, or mostly dark with the striped pattern only on part of their coats.

wzCJNj3Baa	Because the temperature of the universe is estimated to be about 4 Kelvin. But let′s start from the beginning.<br>  <br>  (Intra-)Space contains no matter so heat can not be transferred from the earth to another material. So the only way heat can leave the earth is by radiation.<br>  <br>  The Earth is rotating so the ground will be reheated by the Sun every day. But if the Earth was facing one side to the Sun all the time. Then that one side would get very warm and the other side would get very cold. The side facing away from the Sun would radiate heat but would not receive heat from the Sun. But the atmosphere would still move to the "backside" and currents in the oceans would move heat to the backside. So it wouldn't get completely cold.<br>  <br>  But what if the Earth had no atmosphere and no ocean and one side of the Earth was facing the sun all the time. Would the side facing away from the Sun get down to 0 Kelvin? No because scientists have found that the universe actually has a background radiation. Not only does the stars in the universe emit heat but there seems to be infrared radiation in locations where no stars can be seen. This radiation is believed to have come from the Big Bang and is estimated to be in equivalence of a body with the temperature of about 4 Kelvin. So this is the absolute minimum temperature a body in the universe can reach. If it gets lower it will be reheated by the background radiation.<br>  <br>  In a laboratory however temperatures very close to 0 Kelvin has been reached using special cooling techniques.|`|YpUhEviCaa	Reaching it is impossible because south polr is already cold enough|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Are You kidding ?! -Winter's are cold ENOUGH, as it IS !!!  :)

Gravity is an attraction that every object in the universe has for every other object.

oZrfOhG0aa	That's not always the case, but for those where it is, it makes some sense.  It only takes one pistil for seeds to be fertilized, but it doesn't guarantee that the pollen will find it way to the pistil.  In insect pollinated plants, the insects may visit a different species next, so the pollen would go to the "wrong" type of plant.  And the wind can carry the pollen in the "wrong" direction.  So by producing more stamens (and therefore more pollen) it increases the chances that at least some pollen gets to the "right" place.

Cloned tissues are genetically identical to the person they were cloned from, but they lack all of the environmentally acquired things that the original tissue had.  For example, you could clone tissue from an alcoholic's liver, and even though the original organ would probably be fairly damaged, the new tissue would not be.  This also means that if you cloned your brain tissue, it would not portray any part of your personality.  <br>  <br>  In addition, I'm not certain that it is possible to clone an entire brain, and I'm fairly sure that no one would want to, since if you transplanted the entire thing the recipient wouldn't be the same person anymore...

It takes a lot of salt to completely saturate water, about 2 pounds per gallon.<br>  <br>  One thing to know about the use of salt on ice streets: salt doesn't actually melt ice/snow.  Salt lowers the freezing point of water, so it should be applied before freezing temperatures hit to be effective.|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	Brine is actually put on before it snows so when they plow the snow isn't stuck to the concrete.
