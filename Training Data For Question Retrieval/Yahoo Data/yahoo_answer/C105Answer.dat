A successful package will be one where the money is immediately spent, as that goes to paying wages, so employees can buy things, so more wages can be paid, etc... the wheel goes round and round.    Bush's stimulus package was unsuccessful, because most of it was in the form of a check, which most people saved (or paid off an existing bill) instead of spending it.

This need not be bad if the parents cooperate To see that the kids spend a maximum amount of time with each parent. unfortunately, it all too often translates into very little visitation time with the non-custodial parent, and lots of bitter disputes over missed Visits and inconvenience. The best remedy would be to agree on a parenting plan with visitation clearly defined and return to court for an order otherwise you are basically at his mercy for the terms.~

I'm not familiar with the doctrine of the Mormon faith but most religions speak somewhere about tolerance.  This issue is absolutely heartbreaking because no matter what sexual orientation someone has, they still need spiritual ministering.  This lack of tolerance in your church and churches across the country tells the story of a double-standard and high levels of prejudice.

It sounds like your whole life is based around the church, though.  All I can say is, these people are mortal, not divine, so do not let them rule your life!!! You will not change their minds.

But running away from this will not solve your problem not matter what your opinion towards her new lifestyle maybe.    I say continue  to go to church that way you can either:    A.

There is no way you can say it's illegal because of separation of church and state. The government isn't going to control the actions of the church, especially when they can cite their religious doctrine as the reason for their actions (as long as the actions aren't illegal, which this isn't).   That's really unfortunate. Honestly, if tis upsets you so much, I'm surprised you're a member of this church. They are obviously preaching things that you don't agree with. The only advice I could really give you is to try to find a different church. I know that some branches of Christianity are more open to things like this than others.   Good luck. I hope your daughter is dealing okay. It's hard enough to be confused without people telling you your feelings are sick. That's really sad.

h6c0qGwaaa	Muerto Mujados I do not except you to understand "human" emotions, so please if you do not know or can not civilly participate then please keep your hands in your pants pockets as not to bother others.    No Easy Walk to Freedom I found to be three things a speech, a book and a song.  As a speech it began,   "No Easy Walk to Freedom"  "Presidential Address(1) by Nelson R. Mandela to the ANC (Transvaal) Congress"    21 September 1953    "Since 1912 and year after year thereafter, in their homes and local areas, in provincial and national gatherings, on trains and buses, in the factories and on the farms, in cities, villages, shanty towns, schools and prisons, the African people have discussed the shameful misdeeds of those who rule the country. Year after year, they have raised their voices in condemnation of the grinding poverty of the people, the low wages, the acute shortage of land, the inhuman exploitation and the whole policy of white domination. But instead of more freedom repression began to grow in volume and intensity and it seemed that all their sacrifices would end up in smoke and dust. Today the entire country knows that their labours were not in vain for a new spirit and new ideas have gripped our people. Today the people speak the language of action: there is a mighty awakening among the men and women of our country and the year 1952 stands out as the year of this upsurge of national consciousness."  Note 1 reads "This was the Presidential address by Nelson Mandela to the ANC Transvaal Conference. He was elected as ANC Transvaal President earlier in the year but had been served with a banning order and the address was therefore read on his behalf."  http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/speeches/1...    It is a worth reading because it gives Mr. Mandela's feelings on the treatment of his countries people when viewed as less because of the color of their skins, it talks about progress made and the victory that awaits, it gives hope that continuing is worth its efforts.     The closing statement says it all,  ""Dangers and difficulties have not deterred us in the past, they will not frighten us now. But we must be prepared for them like men in business who do not waste energy in vain talk and idle action. The way of preparation (for action) lies in our rooting out all impurity and indiscipline from our organisation and making it the bright and shining instrument that will cleave its way to (Africa's) freedom."     In the book "No Easy Walk to Freedom" By Nelson Mandela, Ruth First, they give transcripts from the trials, speeches, letters from underground and articles in parts and in whole.  http://books.google.com/books?id=rMiKlmG...    And the song "No Easy Walk to Freedom" from Peter, Paul and Mary who disbanded around 1970 can be found on the album of the same name. During this time the band was part of a huge support for anti-apartheid.    "No Easy Walk to Freedom"    "Brother martin was walkin with me,  And every step I heard liberty  Tho hes fallin, come a million behind!  Glory, hallelujah, gonna make it this time!  Chorus:  No easy walk to freedom,  No easy walk to freedom,  Keep on walkin and we shall be free  Thats how were gonna make history  Across the ocean, the bloods running warm  I, I hear it coming, theres a thunderin storm  Just like we lived it, you know that its true,  Nelson mandela, now were walkin with you!  (chorus)  In our land, not so long ago,  We lived the struggle, and thats how we know  Slavery abolished, comin freedoms call  Keep on walking and apartheid will fall!  (chorus)  Oh, bread for the body, theres got to be  But a soul will die without liberty  Pray for the day when the struggle is past!  Freedom for all! free at last! free at last!

jLI0IgWkaa	you probably have to serve, but ask them if you can postpone your jury duty for a different case (say in the summer time, when you don't have to teach.)    If you're principal writes up a report of how you are indispensable it might help.    hey eldude, that's just the problem, that you're not a teacher.  A truly dedicated teacher does not feel comfortable putting a sub incharge of her class -- even for an important thing like civil duty, because no matter how "good" the sub is, the lessons are never the same with a sub, then with the teacher actually teaching the lesson. I always find that when I have a sub in my class, it takes at least 3 lessons to get my class back to the level and point of learning where I left them off,  before there was a sub in charge. that's just the way it is. so yes, civic duty is important, but not at the expense of the children's learning.    good luck .|`|ffe8fdebdc4a1d2c733dc6b66a78cbf0aa	Why should a teacher be excused from their civic duty and responsibility?

etcMARCAaa	It's pretty safe to say that the economic system of our nation and how it relates to the rest of the world is about 10 times as complex as brain surgery.  Its unlikely to find two economist who can even agree on our problems much less the causes and for everyone that labels something a factor of our crisis there is another that will call it the one brilliant idea we ever had.   I personally believe that we have been building up a financial crisis for decades.  We have an economy based mostly on debt.  We sell it and call it credit. As consumer debt rises, consumers are forced to purchase less because debt takes more and more of their income. If their income raises then so does their credit rating which in turn lets them purchase for a short time followed by a lifetime of paying off their debt. People have less money in their pocket to employ the service industry that makes up a large part of our economy. As companies replace labor with automation or out sources to raise their profit/stock value they lay off consumers who in turn spend less.    As far as the housing crisis goes, that was irresponsible and stupid practices on the part of banks, urged by the government with no thought to what would inevitably occur.  Did they honestly think that property values would just rise to infinity?  Inevitably prices would reach a point where even the most clueless people would realize the houses cost too much regardless of how easy it was to finance.  We had 1500 square foot houses with asking prices of $300,000 here in the US and that was before the interest of a loan with a balloon payment.  So people stopped buying and bankers were shocked.  These are experts who have devoted their lives to the study of finance and they couldn't figure out that if something cost far more than what it is worth people might not buy it.   I guess if you want one primary cause of our problems it is rampant unrestricted greed at nearly every level.  But we tend to consider greed a virtue so I doubt if we will solve that anytime soon.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	The democrats told the banks they HAD TO give loans to folks that don't qualify.....

Most of those people have the highest repayment records, they were scammed, VICTIMS. First the economy was going south becuse George Bush is a crook and a thief and they were sucking the social security funds dry and paying themselves millions more than should be paid for war services.  Then they discontinued all corporate regulations, tried to legalize predatory lending and usury rates.  They artificially  propped the economy up by keeping interest rates low and encouraging people to buy houses or invest.  Then they started sucking people in to scam loans that would adjust to usury rates.  A normal adjustable loan should never go up like these did when the % rates are so low., they should go down.  But the greed machine was cranking ala George Bush, Dick Cheney style.  Every one take as much as you can ***** every one over who is in your path.   So then the loans started going up, people wanted to sell (too many) and then it just started to crumble.  Had there not been millions of preditory loans out there perhaps most of this would not  have happened. Just when we would think it was as bad as it could get, it would get worse.  When every ash wipe around started short selling so the market started going to hell and the banks were bundling bad loans together and telling companies like AIG they were good & going to get better when they went up, and they bought them.  I guess a lot of them.  That doesn't say much for their brains.  So much damm greed that they just would not stop making bad loans, selling them, and now we are where we are today.  Thanks, George.  And those of you who got a tax cut got it because you lost money, or lost a job.  Yea Republicans..  I personally think George Bush was furious becuz his daddy got beat,  then because (to clean up the debt) Clinton put back the CUT taxes from the top 1% of America (only those making over 250K ) not the rest of you you did not have one.  That and he saw the alternative energy needs were going to come so they were going to bleed the oil industry and us dry, and steal as much of our tax dollars as they could from granting favors, to Haliburtin contracts with out competitive bidding.    The top 1% of the country is about 700 billion richer while we have been destroyed.  I pray for the worst possible things to happen to those selfish pig crooks.    CORPORATE GREED AND DEREGULATION AT IT'S BEST.  DO NOT FORGET THIS WHEN FAT JEB BUSH WANTS TO RUN.

He was the founder of the 1st Special Service Forces, an elite paratrooper/commando unit during World War 2, very similar to that of the OSS.    United States Army Special Forces were formed in 1952, initially under the US Army Psychological Warfare Division headed by then-BG Robert A. McClure.    Special Operations Command was formed by the US Army Psychological Warfare Center which was activated in May 1952. The initial 10th Special Forces Group was formed in June 1952, and was commanded by Colonel Aaron Bank. Its formation coincided with the establishment of the Psychological Warfare School, which is now known as the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School.

JOXQrsw0aa	It is not really possible to say what your chances are without knowing what "weren't good" and "crap"  really mean and with no indication of  high school curriculum or SAT/ACT scores. USNA is not only looking at grades and test scores. They are looking at the whole person score.    Here is how OPNAVINST 1420.1A defines scholastically qualified:    g.  Scholastically qualified as determined by the Naval Academy based upon:            (1) An acceptable secondary school transcript with college preparatory subjects and grades indicating college capability and a class standing normally in the top 40 percent in high school.  To be competitive, applicants should have completed 4 years of math, (including a strong foundation in geometry, algebra and trigonometry), 4 years of English, and 1 year of chemistry.  Additionally, physics, history, and 2 years of a foreign language are strongly recommended.  Courses in pre-calculus or calculus are also very valuable and encouraged.              (2) Acceptable score(s) on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) or the American College Testing (ACT) Program Test.  These tests must be no more than 2 years old upon applying for the Naval Academy.  To increase competitiveness these tests should be taken within 1 year.  To be considered for a Secretary of the Navy nomination, a candidate should obtain an SAT score of 550 Math and 500 Verbal, or ACT scores of 24 Math and 22 English.  These scores are not competitive for entrance into the Naval Academy, but may place a candidate in contention for NAPS based on a "whole person" assessment.  Tests may be taken more than once, and the highest scores in each category on either test will be accepted.    http://www.usna.edu/Admissions/documents...    There are about 1700 offers of appointments given to the Naval Academy each year. About 1250 accept. Of this 170 are for active duty and reserve Navy and Marines. At least half of these 170 appointments go  to HS students who join the Navy Reserves to enter NAPS. So a maximum of  85 appointments each year go to active duty and reserve Navy and Marines who actually were in the Navy or Marines at the time of application to the Naval Academy. Let's split this 85 2/3 for Navy and  1/3 for Marines. That is 57 appointments for active duty and reserve Navy. There is also an age limitation. 23 on July 1 of the year entering the Academy.   I honestly feel any guy has  a better chance going to a Military JC  or a Maritime Academy or a College with and NROTC detachment and  either working on weak academic areas or taking a similar curriculum to 1st year at USNA  or maybe a  curriculum similar to what the preps sponsored by the Naval Academy Foundation take:  http://www.nmmi.edu/prep/usna.html  ....and then applying to the Naval Academy and other schools and also for the NROTC scholarship. I don't know what your academic record is so I cannot make more specific recommendations. NMMI is only about 13,000/yr including Room and Board for out of state.   http://www.nmmi.edu/Business/newchg.html  If you turn in the FAFSA,  federal grants will probably pay for much of this if your parents don't have the resources.  http://www.nmmi.edu/FinancialAid/finaidj...  If the Naval Academy did not work out you'd have a post grad year or a year of college and could re evaluate if you wanted to give the Academy another year and then if that didn't work out you'd have two years and could continue on and get a commission through NROTC.  If you were appointed to the academy you would be able to validate out of certain classes. That is the best I can do without more specific information. In the Navy whether you are a viable candidate  is going to depend on the recommendation  of a CO who you may not get along with or who might just be a jerk  and  from two additional officers. Your CO even gets to choose whether you can be recommended for NAPS.  http://www.usna.edu/Admissions/stactive....   http://www.usna.edu/Admissions/documents...|`|9tcv3TiWaa	It is great to have a dream.  Make sure though that the dream is realistic, the Nuke program is hard, you have to get a very high ASVAB to have it offered to you.  The school alone is 2 years, then you have to do Sub training, then when assigned you have to do qualifications to earn the dolphins and that isn't easy at all.  It is possible for you to do it, have a positive attitude, do well in studies, listen, learn and don't talk back.

AA11644291	It kind of depends on where you live. If you're in a smaller city, they will probably take it more seriously. If you're in a bigger city, they will ignore it because it takes more time to deal with than the 25 bucks is worth to them. I highly doubt though that they will increase it without notifying you. The next time you go to the DVM, it may pop up and you can pay it then. Or when you have business at City Hall, it might pop up. If I were you, I'd just forget about it until I had $25 and give it to them. They're just happy to get anything they can. They won't penalize you.

aTAUOI8caa	It passed the House of Representatives.  It has not passed the Senate, and then there is still the House/Senate meeting to turn it into the final bill.    There is also a Republican plan for the economy that needs to be voted on as well.          But I also hope it's a good thing.  Obama has gone to all Democrats and Republicans, and plenty of economists.  I'm hoping that he got the input that he wants and can sift through the good stuff while tossing out the bullsh*t to get a good plan.    From what I've seen of him, he's got the ability to do this right.  But this is a big thing for anyone.  We'll see, but I'm hopeful.

If that money is added to the economy, it devalues the money already out there.....unless the fed originates loans to back the value of that new money.  Someone needs to buy those loans.  The number one purchaser are oil producing nations that are required by treaty to take a percentage of those oil profits and buy US debt.    The price of oil has crashed hardcore.  So has the amount of profits these oil producing nations make.  And with it, the amount of money they spend buying US debt.  This has created a glut in the loan market.  Too much money loaned out and not enough people willing to buy that loan as a long term asset.  That's why the credit markets are frozen and is almost the sole cause of our economy having trouble.    I would like to point out that the price of oil crashed because the democrats pushed through a bill and created an organization that would essentially throw speculators in jail for the (LEGAL) behavior of investing in such a way that it drove up the price of oil.  They all dropped out of that market in a panic....causing the oil futures market to crash....the price of oil went down with it.    By spending money like a drunken sailor, all Obama is doing is making the situation worse...ALOT worse.  The amount of debt will go up.  The credit markets will freeze up even more.  Businesses won't be able to borrow the money they need and will go out of business before they can turn a profit.  People will be laid off.    Worse....what if the fed tells Obama he can't have the loans to underwrite his congressional spending?  If he still insists on spending that money that doesn't yet exist, it will result in hyper-inflation.  Our old pal from the Carter years, stagflation, will be back.    So far, Obama gets an F on the economy.  His plan isn't just unworkable, it shows real ignorance for how our economy works.  Our congress needs to cease all spending immediately if they want the economy to recover.|`|5uFXCBpraa	Only 12% of it has a chance of stimulating the economy.  The rest is pork.

We are throwing good money after bad.  I've been watching CSPAN the last few days, and it is really comical.  Here is the dialog:     Republican:  "Can we at least know where our money is going?"    Democrat:  " The time that it takes to answer your question is time that Americans don't have a stimulus package!"    Republican:  "Ok, can we at least take out all of the pork-barrel and ear-marked money to your friends?"    Democrat: "  You sir, are UNAMERICAN!  You are just trying to hold up this process.  We need to pass this bill NOW!"    Republican:  "  Isn't that what Nancy Pelosi told us about the last 85 BILLION dollars that we forked over to financial institutions, with zero results?"     Democrat:  " Ok, maybe you're not understanding, we're in power now and your voice doesn't matter"|`|IwyqrWneaa	The plan that passed the house is pathetic.  We should all be outraged.  We are being duped - again.  There is very little that in this bill that will do anything at all to stimulate this economy. I can't believe that Nancy Pelosi pretty much authored this bill - Obama should have authored it in the White House.  What an embarrassment.  Why should government jobs be grown?  That is the sector that has seen THE LEAST amount of unemployment.  They don't care about us - none of them.  Tax cuts work - let us keep our money in our paychecks (if we can get a job), make it attractive for businesses to hire employees, put the money in roads and bridges that will get the most bang for the buck.  What the heck does money for STD's and birth control do to help us all?  These people in DC need to be thrown out - all of them.  Even Jim Cramer/CNBC Mad Money (a  big Obama supporter) said the Republicans are right, right, right on this.  He said this was a joke.  There is no reputable economist that believes this is worth the paper it is written on.  The way this is written will only grow the GDP by 1% - maybe 3% at the most - not enough to do anything but save a few jobs for a few more months.  We don't need government sticking their hands in our pockets.  Look around at everything they touch - they can't do anything right - let the people do it.  The New York Times has written some good articles along with Wall Street Journal concerning this mess.|`|BHBQPFzlaa	It's the right way to inject money back into the economy. If we were to just give people tax breaks (what republicans were pushing for), odds are  that most folks would do what they did with bush's tax breaks -- save it or use it to pay off an existing bill.

p21qJQ4Jaa	yes you can do this...    get through bootcamp, MCT, MOS school, and get back into school full time for a year. ONce you get to that point you will want to contact an OSO (officer selection officer) in your area and let him know what you would like to do. He will more than likely set up a meeting with you and get a package started to get contracted to go to OCS (officers candidate school) under the PLC (platoon leaders course) program. basically what uould happen from there is once you get contracted for OCS that will void out your reservist contract and you will get sent to OCS each summer after your sophomore and junior year. As long as you graduate from OCS and you graduate from college you will get your commission as a 2nd Lt. in the Marine Corps. From there you will get sent to TBS (the basic school) to learn how to be an officer and then to your new MOS school.

In contrast, other leading countries from England to Japan and the up and coming BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) economies are focused on repetition, memorization, and replication. If you are interested in medicine, you will note that most new drugs are developed in the US. You could look at other entrepreneurial characteristics like number of inventions/patents.

21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	Ok. When bringing the gun onto base you have to have it unloaded and either the gun itself or the ammo locked in a compartment (IE locked glove box or trunk. The other portion has to be seperate and out of arms reach...like behind the drivers seat.   You will have to go to the Military Police Station and pick up a Personal Weapons Registration form. You will fill this out and take it to your chain of command to be signed. Once signed you will take the original back to the Military Police Station. You will keep a copy with the weapon at all times (they will tell you which copy)  If you live in the barracks you must keep the weapon in the Unit Arms Room and can withdraw it at any time that the Arms Room Personnel are present to sign it out to you. As soon as you are finished @ the range you will have to store it back in the Arms Room.   If you live in housing then you can store the weapon in your home (still has to be registered of course) and any time you transport it around base you will have to store it in your car the way I described above.|`|9dd7255bfe9e90bbd64019154baae7a6aa	In the Army, we had to go to the MP station first to let them know we are bringing a personal weapon on base, the to our company commander and he signs some paperwork so you may store it in the Arms room.

Whatever happened to the right to bear arms?|`|AiqQgy0faa	if you want to take it on base you have to register it with the armory.  you can take it on base as long as it isn't loaded and the gun and ammo are in separate places like the trunk and glove compartment.

Dangerously silent.|`|9npIzlHKaa	Because there's a new President who actually has a well thought out plan that leads to ultimate peace.  Not a plan that has no end and only exists for endless war and war-profiteering.  There's the difference.|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	There's no peace movement, only pansies that want to see America go the way of weak Europe. Sure you can reason with terrorists!

64SObnr5aa	The Taliban was not responsible for 911, they refused to turn over those responsible unless proof was given.  Instead, we attacked  We have still never proved Bin Laden was responsible, it is only thought he was.  The true alleged confession tape was not a true translation.  If it was, then we could never say he admitted to it.    One trillion in all of our costs for the wars is an increase in military spending.    Journalists have been jailed in the USA and our propped up governments in Iraq and Afghanistan for saying things against our government and policies.

"    Of all the enemies to public liberty war is, perhaps, the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other.

No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare."     James Madison, Political Observations, 1795    Edit: Stilwaters, please provide a link to your figures.

The US military has not killed 600,000 civilians. Ofcourse military spending went up. That's common sense.   Saddam was stupid to not allow UN inspectors do there job man!

That has been trashed.  And the far left and the neocons go off on you if you disagree with them, thus causing damage to the 1st amendment.  So 2 of 10 are a major issue.|`|xVRGz3Oaaa	Think there are no factual statements presented--sorry moveon.org--it did not work.|`|e0c51b39028498ec82e61c51a9b0b0e5aa	I think that number 1 is factual, that is it can be easily proven using data.    Number two is open to interpretation.  Your subversion may be protection to someone else.    Number three is half factual, as the war in Afghanistan could easily be considered retaliatory.      I would say that you're batting about .500 in terms of actual FACTS.  There is a pretty strict definition of the term.  Two of your facts are dependent on the definition of the terms you're using, namely "subverted" and "preemptive".  If I were using these points in a formal debate or a a formal argument I would change the wording at the least.|`|maBzn6v7aa	I don't know about ALL the Bill of Rights.

Your "facts" are phony. Especially the "600 thousand civilians" number. That was debunked a while ago.    I just found out your first fact is phony too.     http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0904490.h...    "You can't debunk deaths?"    You can debunk phony studies that manufacture phony numbers of phony deaths. They didnt count any bodies. They took a POLL! You cant gauge the number of deaths with an opinion poll!

YnlT7m8raa	Keep watching the dollar. We're going to get to experience this first hand.|`|VxPBolWgaa	I think that it is a very sad thing that this type of human disrespect is still allowed to go on.  The people there want the change,  they voted for it.  But corruption is so high up that there is no way we can help.  The exchange rate to the Zim Dollar is not as important as the many that are dying of Cholera and starvation.  It is not fair that we get to live in a place that has an abundance of groceries and restaurants that we have the option to choose sometimes so many that it is hard to just pick one.  There is nothing on the shelves there,   there is no gas for their vehicles,  there is no hope for so many people that do not deserve to be in that situation. I wish that we could send in a big red cross package with food and aid and all the trimmings.  The only problem is if it will be received and distributed to the people who it is intended for.  I do wish the people of that country a better life.  Even though English rule was not the best thing for those people,  I dont think the system they have now is really working.  They need to revamp their country from top to bottom and the only thing that is going to do that is time.  Hopefully they come to some sort of power sharing agreement,  but that is honestly in my opinion doubtful on many levels.  The dude does not want to give up his seat.  He should just go to one of his houses in the Swiss Alps or whereever and just kick it.  They need some sort of hope to make it through this mess and a bunch of much needed help from the rest of the world.  If the spotlight comes to that country and they revolt,  our government will probably step in at some point,  What role they will play right now I really dont know how much they would want to be involved politically,  but in a human awarness campaign we would win over more countries respect if we non-violently assisted that country to regain itself.    I love America and the people of Zimbabwe.|`|FpioJ7F5aa	The Organization of African States could fix that problem in a new york minute.  They could fix it, and make it permanet, and they don't.

Why should we support his failed ideas which are the same socialist ones that FDR tried.    I hope you realize that all Obama wants is more control over the private sector.

You are way to sensitive and you won't last these next 4 years like this. I am going to tell you that there wasn't one once of support from the left and the democrats for Bush so you really are asking a lot. Not only wouldn't they support Bush they literally mauled McCain and Palin and not because of who they were but the party they represented. It was your side who started this all. And I do think Obama is going to destroy us.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	Name exactly what every little thing is that you speak of. Independent here, but tiring quickly of this witch hunt against Reps. Obama is making decisions, and BIG ONES, that affect us all--and therefore, he is responsible for each and every move he made. And similarly, since you mentioned Bush, you can't only hold a president responsible for his actions when he is a Republican. Obama is screwing us over big time, I'm sad for the people that can't see it. They will be the least prepared.|`|AA11148986	Cause they needed someone to blame, but they don't want to blame themselves.    PS: Bush had a 90% approval rating after 9/11. I think he had to have a few liberal Democrats in there, it's too high to be just Republicans and independents.|`|4eb0e2f9d5b148fde3255d87f69f396daa	Democrats have had it in for Bush since Gore lost the election to him in 2000.  If you believe that Bush's "downturn" began with Katrina, how do you figure that?  Better yet, why are you blaming Bush for the lack of leadership of Louisiana's local government.    That whole Nagin, Blanco, FEMA thing was a fiasco and should not be levied on Bush's shoulders when the state never did a thing about those levies.    We get the government we deserve.  The majority spoke and now we all suffer.    So in response to your request that we show a little mercy?  He has done nothing to inspire hope or change.  It is business as usual.  I think before the Bama's 4 years are up, some of you Bush haters will be wishing he was still in office.  We don't have much anything more than a slick politician in office now that is going to be able to do anything he wants to, because the Democratic congress isn't go to do anything but go along with whatever he says.|`|ZfxLoMwMaa	Yes.  Repuglicans are going to show their a^^.  They can't stand that a black man is president.   They are going to fight him every step of the way and let him know he's not like them, not white. Obama is tying to built a bridge and be bipartisan.  Barack is extending his hand as friendly hand of freindship and the repubs still have their hands in a fist. ;))|`|0lV2C78xaa	I am a liberal southeastern Louisiana resident and I must say, Bush had little fault in Katrina. His biggest fault would be lack of funds on the levees(a federal responsibility, not a local one). But Blanco & Nagin were no angels either. Thank goodness I'm two miles outside of New Orleans city proper, so while I can enjoy the city when I want, Nagin is NOT my mayor(though since we're neighbors, much of what he does effects us) and THANK GOODNESS FOR JINDAL.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	they are so pissed off about thei old byddy george being such a failure that they are just blowing off steam. just listen to jay z"S  momma he is really upset about his fallen hero.|`|AA10206116	Because he said he was going to be as bipartisan as possible, but the stimulus plan passed today and not one republican voted for it.|`|mT6b7INZaa	The GOP effed things up so badly that even they don't really believe what they are saying ...|`|ayhDyb16aa	Ohhh and the compassionate caring Democrats didnt blame everything under the sun on Bush ?

Seems to me they are taking the equity out of the country with no intention of paying anything back.  All they can do now is find another way to tax us to make up for what they appear to be stealing.|`|T4C4r5sbaa	The difference is that Obama's $819 Billion dollar stimulus bill includes a "Buy American" provision demanding that all corporations wanting to get a piece of the government "pork" fest (as some have called it) must use only American made products (and therefore hire Americans) for those jobs.  This is protectionism trade policy designed to reverse the flow of jobs out of the country and bring them back home so that Americans can get back to work and stop living on the dole.  Sounds like a good plan to me.  If there are more people working, then there are more people to pay back that money to the government through "taxes".|`|RNkw1BWVaa	Much better. Buy American! Put Americans to work.    Then I hope he directs the IRS to go after all those wealthy tax cheats that are off-shoring corporate profits while taking government contracts. That has got to stop!

The Japanese economy stagflated in the early 1990's, and Japanese governmental spending skyrocketed in a futile attempt to jumpstart the economy, including passing numerus stimulus packages.

After all, there will be another phony conservative Republican elected again someday.|`|xVRGz3Oaaa	It will not be 2 years, they will be back by summer for more spending money--not a stimulus mind you but spending money.|`|maBzn6v7aa	More like a few weeks.......    I know it for a FACT:    http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090129/ap_o...    WASHINGTON  The Obama administration is developing proposals to help rescue the banking system that could cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars beyond the $700 billion bailout Congress already has approved.    Details are still being worked out. But the administration is looking to spend hundreds of billions more to address the foreclosure crisis, help banks get out from under weighty bad assets and expand liquidity programs.|`|AXqmo8rlaa	2 years!!!....try 6 months!   The new government is sucking on the worlds biggest udder....the American taxpayer......and their appetite has only just been whetted.
WbOcDjfeaa	The equation Obama presents cannot sustain itself. By the time he grows the government to his liking taxes will not be enough.    The one proven way to create jobs is the one thing Obama is not doing, cut taxes for Business.    Obama's agenda appears to be a downward spiral to the point where all industry, banks, and maybe even property is owned by the government.    My inference is Obama's agenda appears socialist.|`|LiC73eggaa	no, it's not true.  you lie.  there is a lot of money out there that we can use to help the economy.  You think Bernanke needs taxes?|`|KAKXZw0Qaa	No kidding just ask Republican George W. Bush .|`|PoJLz2fhaa	People get mad when they have to pay taxes for things, then also get mad when the government tries to cut programs and roads and schools are falling apart|`|qSm8N91iaa	You are correct.. Tell it to the dummies...|`|VOccyg7daa	You got it. However, there are some people out there that that's alright with. They want government to provide everything for them. Besides, those people don't pay taxes anyways.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	You can't inject common sense into a group that believes people didn't vote for Obama because they are racist. You expect them to understand this?|`|tnkp8n2Zaa	bigger govt. should in theory be mroe efficient then going through more middlemen, we pay state and local taxes too but now all of our daily consumer products have gone way up.
QlPTVcrHaa	It is not approved yet.    It still has to go to the Senate.    The word is that, despite waiting until the last minute and offering up a slap-dash alternative with no figures, the Republicans made their point that they want more say-so.    The Senate leaders are indicating that they are more open to compromise providing the Republicans don't get the idea that since the Democrats are open to compromise, they are not going to let the Republicans try to hijack the process (which they probably will).    From what I've gathered from reading differing accounts...    http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&tab=wn...    ...the general consensus is that the tax breaks need tweaking, some pork trimming is in order, and the "long term" provisions need to be cut and introduced as follow up legislation.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	You are making an assumption that in the future there will be income, taxes, and government.  This is highly unlikely.  A couple of years from now we'll look back on the good old days of government interference.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	It is my understanding that Pres. Obama was confident that the senate would approve it. It won't take more than just a couple of votes from the Senate Republicans to pass the whole works. All I can say is that no matter how much we scream about the stupidity of this whole thing, the powers that be in Washington are not going to listen. It won't be long and we will find the government taking over more businesses because they failed to pass the bail out test etc...or at least that will be the excuse. Now liberals, when that happens, will you admit that THAT FACT when it comes is a true definition of socialism? When the people lose the power, government owns us.|`|i0vcEyJtaa	There is still time to contact them.|`|fUh7LHzvaa	Most economists agree the best way to stimulate the economy is to spend, spend, spend.    Too bad Republicans had to spend when times were good. So much for fiscal conservatism from them.|`|BUI2nlUVaa	who can stop it?  the dems have a lock on the house and senate.  only one vote to stop a filibuster?  come on now.|`|0tp5qpzkaa	Who are we to stop it, we have no voice other than our politicians, which I can proudly say my state's Democratic Politician voted "no". Hope he still has his job tomorrow, lol.|`|XvovBRlnaa	because we love america|`|7aed01780e0f597b42c6f8b57a2f4065aa	Good question    I am sure that many Americans, like you and me, wrote to their Congressman to voice their opposition to it.   What we found out, although for me it has been common knowledge since the 50's, is that we don't have high paid lobbyists calling the shots for us.  We lose!    We can vote the scoundrels out, if a candidate can drum up enough loot to oust an incumbent, but the damage will already be done and the scoundrel will leave office richer than he entered it.  Plus, he will then become a high paid lobbyist.    Today, I read that Obama has reneged on his word about hiring lobbyists and all the apologists are falling over themselves to define the difference between his lobbyists and those that worked in the previous adminstrations.    makes me proud that I voted for Ron Paul|`|7cbc19e2f9c7ea7d710c505dfeaf136daa	Maybe because MANY Nobel Prize Winning Economists agree with his plan.|`|604963ef82ec90b5bd0becdfe005c25eaa	We approved it?  When did we ever get to vote on such a disastrous thing?    The sheep were asleep when Bush did away with our civil rights, all in the name of keeping us safe.  You don't take away liberties to protect them.
RrmWvGYBaa	I was extremely happy with Bush in office...    and i was not a supporter of Obama, but i do know that it is too early for most of the Obama voters to tell.  Most of them are very uneducated about his current plan that they probably wont even hear about it until it ends up making them pay more money.     but,...many will probably still love him just because he is black. Skin color does not matter and it shouldnt have effected this election. highly unfair.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	i have to be pleased with my choice since i had no choice. i hated bush  couldnt stand palin so therefore i couldnt vote for mccain  noe how"s that grab you ???|`|KAKXZw0Qaa	YES very   Thank You|`|XoYaFgkyaa	Its too soon, it will take them at least 7 years, then the mob will be iching for a "change" and someone will come along and go, "I"LL GIVE YOU EVERYTHING YOU WANTED!".  They will all go aaaahhh oooohhhh, and vote.|`|AA10653749	YES....Why wouldn't we be ?|`|CZdFWit7aa	So far so good|`|8YjutSI2aa	That is very good question.. because Obama seemed to be doing good job getting people attention and showing good side of him until Jan 20th.. He completely changed.. now he is doing stuff that every "very far leftist liberals" already done or would do.. But that doesn't surprised me.. I didn't voted for him, but I was hoping Obama would do well.. before Jan 20, he did impress me on things he did, until after Jan 20th, my hopes for Obama has drowned.. But we can wait few more months and hope for the best.. God is in control.|`|AA11148986	Yes|`|M6TNZt9baa	Damn str8, I'm pleased!|`|LiC73eggaa	yes, got my big mac, now i'll get a check too.|`|7P518NRmaa	I'm just as pleased as I was when I left the voting booth. I'm confident in our government for the first time since Bill Clinton left office.|`|0PkFuZMwaa	YES I AM.and will do it again.and not because of the color of his skin.|`|AA10632060	YES
fAcVndo7aa	Legally, a private school can make any rule it wants to, as long as it does not contradict any state or federal laws.    You can try taking a petition, or attending school board meetings (or PTA, or whatever your school may have), but I wouldn't count on it making much of a difference.  As for the reasoning behind it, while you are supposed to be in school, the school can potentially be held responsible for anything that happens to you.  It sounds like they are restricting you so that they know where you are.  The staying for an extra hour rule, I would guess is to meet some mandate of how many hours you have to be in school for it to be considered a full day.|`|1hciyvKdaa	I doubt it. In schools who allow kids to leave at will, personal injuries go up, ditching goes up, controlling the student flow back into the school goes up. Car accidents around and near the school goes up. Schools with huge populations, that have fast food nearby do this to speed up lunch and use less payroll persons working in the cafeteria. So they look the other way to the bad parts of an open campus. You can try but, more illegal activities also take place too I forgot to mention, and since your parents are paying the bills or special program, it would take all the parents if they pay for it, to rally the cause not the students.|`|VOccyg7daa	Nope. In school you have virtually no rights. Sorry.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	you don't -your parents have paid for these rules.  if you want a more liberal place to learn, return to public school.|`|UldvbAIWaa	sorry your boned unless you can bring up things like   if ur 18 than ur aloud to sign your self out... um just make a good case to ur dean or w.e you call the schools head.. but no nothing legal about it.|`|PoJLz2fhaa	I went to a public school and we weren't allowed to leave for lunch, but then again it was a public school and easy to break rules.|`|Wcb1ZCb2aa	Well there is 1 month of the year where you can make a case to your city school board and you can change things if you have a good case in public but your private so, nothing|`|ItEUj0miaa	No private schools set their own rules you cant change them they are not run by the government you can't fight them I got to a public school 2100 people they dont give a **** we just go where ever we want.|`|BA3tFr4oaa	I've got the same problem-private school rules suck! You probably can't do anything, my school says "It's for safety reasons'' and all that crap.|`|LitjxAAEaa	it's not legal i guess.... But just hop the fence.... You just gotta b low key....
0sEJuAvQaa	I prefer news papersspecially the NY Times|`|z6mbVz8maa	unlike you, people use toilet paper to wipe their bottoms lol!   The statement you made about things you like....good for you...|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	Yeah? Is that where your dug your brains up from, a congressional toilet? Sure sounds reasonable to me.|`|fc1c892dcf9d7a268b9cf39bc9bcad11aa	I use my penis then a series of seashell shaped devices|`|VzJcl7WAaa	that is a weird question my friend.  very weird info as well lol.    i love politics too.
BIQrsl4paa	AS a former Army recruiter, I can tell you that the policy on retesting does not allow you to retest solely in order to qualify for a specific job. As for the person out here who stated that just passing the test with a 32 would qualify you to be an MP, WRONG. That person, like so many others, seems to think that the Army takes only marginally qualified people and offers them jobs requiring a highel level of intelligence.  Talk with a (your) recruiter and find out what your ST score needs to be for MP's and then do your absolute best on the test.|`|HVMX90Ijaa	you can re take your ASVAB after 30 days    so if you don't do as good as you would like the first time....study up a bit...and try again...    good luck|`|AiqQgy0faa	your not in until you sign the contract.  you can back out at any time until you sign at MEPS and do your oath of enlistment.|`|mm5p5sy6aa	You'll do fine on the ASVAB if you just pay attention and use common sense.    If you don't score high enough you can always retake the test at another time until you score high enough, if MP is what you want then don't settle for less.|`|BMkVOR0caa	For MP you need a score just above passing.  I think 32, for Army and Marines.  36 for the Air Force.  Those are not good scores.|`|uGQ1WtYtaa	Just to let you know you must score a 50 on your ASVAB now to be able to join because so many people were joining they're making it more "challenging" it get in.
ZpO4AJeDaa	Well, this shows that you, just like I, did not drink the Kool-Aid. Since these people have no standards, they can't violate any. If Socialism does work then why are the socialist/communist countries adopting Capitalism?|`|IDZTtipeaa	I know some people said he wasn't a socialist.  I know some people now say socialism is good.  I haven't heard the same person make these claims (with the exception of the socialist candidate for president, who obviously thinks socialism is good, and who unequivocally stated that Obama was not a socialist).   I have been saying that he supports some socialist policies, which does not make him a de facto socialist.  He seems to be like every other president in recent history who has supported some forms of socialism.    In this way I think some socialism is good.|`|2mbiQfSmaa	Obama is above the law.  Anyone daring to take a closer look at his politics are instantly considered unpatriotic.This is very dangerous as there is no accountability for a man like this. He was not elected for his policy he was elected because he stood for "change".  If you ask most people what change he was for they couldn't tell you.  People were sick of a republican president so they just voted for the opposite.|`|AA11086243	the VAST MAJORITY of the people calling him a socialist, used "communist" half the time also when referring to him... and when they said "socialist" most clearly were using it as a synonym with communism    now... is it somewhat socialistic... yes...    is it communist, which was blatantly what they were inferring and saying? no, not even in the same zip code    people have no clue what these terms even mean anymore it seems, so it's difficult to discuss them rationally...    AND who has said "socialism isn't so bad"? I've not heard that from any democrat or even close?    you're reading a lot into it here... and you're making VERY REPUBLICAN LIKE assumptions with no seeming basis...    so, you're not a Republican.. you just act like one?|`|nVQtiU5baa	he has just started to tread on the mill in a  while  we get to know him if he is a real socialist or it was only a "buzz word" thingy bob|`|7aed01780e0f597b42c6f8b57a2f4065aa	Obama never really came out with a cohesive agenda to illustrate how he would make things better since to do so would have required him to substantiate his policies.  He may actually seem to be more centrist than his true socialist party members like Pelosi, Reid, Boxer,and Kerry but he will tow the party line like a good comrade.    Socialism has proven itself to be a bankrupt form of government.  To adhere to it is to admit that one has no initiative, ambition, or work ethic.|`|JthubNIsaa	I didn't vote for Obama.  It will only be when Obama policies start shutting down the media or it's voice, that they will take notice thereby reporting to the people who are spoon fed by them.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	I didn't usually argue that he wasn't socialist.  I just said that if he was, at least he was socialist for the lower classes instead of for the rich as the Bush administration was.|`|YIWKPXokaa	Socialist is the new Republican  "buzz" word.  I doubt that many even know what the word means.|`|lU5mdniUaa	let me break it to you softly we are already a socialist country they just forgot to tell you that. we give free education free loans for education and we have a program which in case you do not have a job get paid not to work and we also have a program if you are old and have worked get paid not to work and we have medical for you too in case just cause we do not say it doesn't mean we are not socialists in a lot of areas in this country get over it and free your mind and come to the dark force of socialist and its ok to be me in this country. have a nice day|`|tDZMJue9aa	cause they dont have any to start with and he is the great savior...and therefore he cant be wrong|`|hIaBgCrgaa	Its all part of the charade thats been going on these days. Its all nonsense democrat repulican letf side right side of the brain. What i see is just some bad acting by clowns who are pretending that they know what they are doing or saying. Reality Check its all irrelevant.    Jah Rules while all the fools go to school to learn the Golden Rules.  so be cool.|`|5lflypTiaa	Anybody who equated Obama's policies with socialism clearly has no idea what socialism means. Whether they support  or attack his policies using that term they aren't worth listening to.|`|45u7BzCUaa	Because it's just a word.  You may not be happy with socialism but others are ok with it.  Capitalism, socialism, they're both just words.  What the goal of each word is, is to keep an economy going.  Whatever it takes.  Why can't you accept what you might think is right, may not be right in another's thoughts?  You're Republican right.....ahhhh that explains it.    Capitalism = deregulation = catastropich failure = today's economy.|`|qcLP5j8zaa	Please provide your source it would enable us to read and form our own opinion.
6t76bgS3aa	it's a person who advocates for certain policy objectives.  they try to get certain laws passed.  lobbyists are employed by all kinds of organizations: drug companies, doctors, taxpayers, tobacco companies, supporters of Israel, pro-life people, pro-choice people all have lobbyists.  Usually with every big issue there are lobbyists working on both sides.    Lobbyists usually work in Washington and state capitals.  They make donations to politicians which some say gives them added influence.  They call up legislators and their staffs and set up meetings where they try to convince them to introduce certain bills.  A lobbyist for a taxpayer group might ask that a bill to lower taxes be introduced for example.  Lobbyists also organize events and even trips for legislators and their staffs.  But all of this is done with the purpose of getting certain laws passed.  Lobbyists believe their role is educational although some people suggest their influence gives wealthy interests to much power.|`|aTAUOI8caa	Sombody who goes around trying to convince various politicians in power to back their cause.    It may be a company, or an organization, or a group representing a movement of some kind.|`|uuHDQr1paa	It's usually an individual that is paid by an individual, company, or organization to sway politicians into voting a certain way.|`|VteSW8nBaa	Everything these posters said is right.  The unfortunate part of the equation is that the donations and favors these people use to influence Congress are often close to, or over the line, of what most people would call bribes.  ps. I am glad your life is good (really!)|`|e2tE6EI8aa	They promise BIG money to politicians if they vote for there Business or cause.

BUI2nlUVaa	Was the fine levied by the school or the city's parking enforcement?  If it was from the school you're fine.  If it's from the city's parking enforcement you probably should pay the fine.  Go to the city and tell them that you completely forgot about a parking ticket you received awhile back.  They'll let you pay it with a penalty and you'll be on your way in a jiff.  No one will know the difference.  If you let it go, there won't be a 'warrant' on the car but if your parents try to re register the car they'll be asked to pay the fine and then you'll be found out.|`|MIc06pgAaa	Tomorrow:  go to traffic court. Explain what happened. Bring money. Pay your fine. Be apologetic and remorseful.|`|agR89OPtaa	Are you sure the ticket was yours and not blown off another car?  I don't know anything else other than call down to the police department and find out if there is an outstanding ticket against your parents car.  They may have just paid it thinking it was theirs.|`|JgnFCxD0aa	People toss those things all the time, but little do they know that they are forwarded to the DMV, and they'll need to pay the bloated fee before they can register their vehicle.    If you have registered your car since then, or did not receive something in the mail, you're probably fine.
tDZMJue9aa	yeah im not either and everyday my unease with him grows, so on yahoos home page right now it says billions passed blah blah will need many more billions to bail out blah blah..so this will continue sounds like we may have sold our souls to the devil cause others chose to live outside their means and obama is signing the reciept..hope its worth it|`|mT6b7INZaa	You will find it helpful if you imagine Sarah Palin standing in the doorway winking at you while you jerk off.|`|z9UAnf3Waa	I completely agree with you.  Our community is literally dying.  Thousands of jobs have been lost and more will soon follow.  We were one of the areas of the country that has endured much of the crisis until recently.  Why?  Because Obama and other liberal fanatics have managed to drive oil and gas production away by making exploration regulations so restrictive that it is not economically feasible for them to continue.  Thanks Obama.  Thanks alot you freaking liberals.  Thanks ever so much to the state and congressional democrats that have made sure that prairie dogs (for you city folks, think country rats) will have a safe place to live.  In the meantime, the PEOPLE of our town are suffering and losing jobs, homes and hope.|`|a2fc33ef68683e992ed3b3d9ab5e762aaa	Yep, the country is going through difficult economical times, and so one of the first things Obama does is to sign an executive order so that we can send millions of dollars to help fund abortions in other countries.       A lot of the terrorists who have already been released have gone right back to their old jobs as terrorists.    I agree that he has weakened our country--all in just a few days.  I cannot imagine what it will be like after 4 years of this nonsense.|`|8l2IMrsFaa	No, I am not tired of it.    LUCK?  Nice interpretation of recent history.    Have a go at The Constitution my activist friend.|`|qSm8N91iaa	He is showing what he is really made of... chicken sh*t... He will be the worst president this country has EVER seen..  He will be damn lucky to make it a full term.|`|08ecd8b76e95de5e722d935f06309747aa	He's doing what a true American is supposed to do. So I guess you think that doing the right thing despite of makes you weak? You have to get with the program. He's doing well for his start and is trying his best. You messed yourself up when you said u "tried to be positive." How about stop trying and do it? Nobody wants an American that's not willing to have faith in her country. Even though a lot of people think Bush really messed up, myself included, we still wanted the man to suceed, and kept holding on. U need to do the same and scratch out the fear. If we get hit, we get hit. But 9/11 shows that we are willing to stick together and fight back if we have to, but America will not swing the first swing. He's trying to avoid all that which is why he's doing the things that he's doing. And the "list goes on," but I think I'll just stop here|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	I am not excited either. I think it was entirely irresponsible for people to only have voted for him because he is black, and they wanted to make history. They needed to vote on the issues. People view him as Jesus Christ.      I am mostly upset at the closing of Gitmo. Those people were there for a reason, and they need to be kept there. I don't care if we torture them, they are terrorists!!!|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	Obama is the worst thing that could have happened to our country at this time. Now all the morons that voted for him are beginning to have buyers remorse and unfortunately there no exchange policy for 4 more years!!|`|BIQrsl4paa	Well pal, they got what they asked for when they voted for him. BHO wouldn't know the truth if it kicked him in the mouth. Witness, he stated there would be no lobbyists in his cabinet, or among his advisers. So far, he has appointed TWO to the cabinet, with possibly more to follow and several have become close advisers.   Some "honesty", huh?  I can't wait to see how he lies to us next.|`|84059953db605b032d680002df0b2a4faa	There, There!

I wish he would get to work and quite begging a celebrity...|`|AA12048731	I think it's the fact of Obama's presidency multiplied by the fact that W is no longer president that has gotten most of america and the world so excited (and al qaeda... concerned)|`|3yXhtBSxaa	I'm not excited.  Like you, I am terrified of what his Presidency is going to do to this country...what it has already done.  I am tired of the self-serving interests of our elected officials.

AA12109395	There is no riciprocal agreement between the Military and any State Police for transferring a certificate, however, your certication will be considered based on the needs of FHP. Since their current manning level and their demand for a K-9 handler determines when they hire, the length of your wait would only be someone's guess.You would more than likely have to get some street time in and a recommendation from your supervisor.|`|AA11644291	Hope this sheds some light on your question.    https://www.cool.army.mil/31b-eswda-psdc...|`|02v1YaI5aa	You would need to get in first.    Then you would be assigned regular patrol like everyone else out of the academy.  Then when a spot in the K9 unit opened up - you could put in for it.

As for Rush being the official leader of the republicans? I am independently wealthy, too... Besides, the real leaders of the republicans slither around, very silently, like the snake in the Garden of Eden; and they do not want to be recognized because they are silently working both sides of the aisle in DC.|`|Qz3sii2caa	He is? Last I checked the Republicans have no leader. Haven't had one since Reagan as far as I'm concerned.     And hey, it's painkillers. It's not like the guy went poking around for illegal street drugs, he got dependent on his post-surgery meds. It can happen to anyone and he's taken care of the problem (meaning he's quit them).     I haven't heard anything about his golf game other than while he enjoys playing, he sucks at it. But who cares about that? It's golf. It's not like he's stuffing ballots when he was behind on his Senate race recount... oh wait, that would be Al Franken (well, he lacks subtlety everywhere else, I shouldn't be surprised that he can't cheat subtly either).    But don't be mad. Bush is outta here. While I'm concerned that Biden is next in line, OBAMA is in the White House. It's a happy time! Perhaps Rush can lend you some of his Viagra?|`|AFqZEOlRaa	Are you implying that Republicans don't take drugs or cheat at golf?  I never heard that!  LOL
qB4qe2iPaa	Not sure about this new form of enlistment but I'm sure they're widening their search do to low enlistment, low reenlistment, the gov't are possibly planning to omit "stop loss" program, and a lot of people are retiring in the military.

These are mostly commonly rocket platforms mounter on armored vehicles, like tank chassis or trucks and can saturate areas with rockets.    Here's a wikipedia link, it had a few images of common MRL systems:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_La...    If its a WW2 design it will most likely be a Katyusha rocket launcher. Here's a link from Wikipedia:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyusha    What you should do is post another question with a link to a image of the weapon specifically.

And I believe that he is a Republican that is more true to your philosophy of conservatism and that he does have integrity and a higher purpose and standard .|`|iWaU76T5aa	Ron Paul is over 70 years old and is a Republican from the State of TEXAS, now who does that remind you of?    Anyways, Mitt Romney has the best shot at beating Obama. Romney/Jindal 2012 ticket has the best shot at getting into the White House.

He would win over many liberals, like he did with me, he would get the stray republicans in the constitution and libertarian party, and Obama couldnt use the economy as his strong suit because Ron Paul is 1 million times more versed in Economics than him. Plus Ron Paul voted NO ON THE PATRIOT ACT, NO ON FISA, NO ON THE BANK BAILOUTS! SO YOU TELL ME, WHO IS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?|`|WbOcDjfeaa	Whoever it is running against Obama they need to be conservative to the core.|`|mPLXUorTaa	I think if there were ever a "messiah" it would be Ron Paul to his drooling, devout followers.

Ron Paul doesn't have a chance of being nominated in 2012.|`|NXGCUotGaa	Ron Paul would have told the truth somthing no one else seems to be able to do. everyone seems to be either a puppet or there being payed off to support whatever.........|`|aTAUOI8caa	Obama is not a "super left-winger", and is in fact far closer to Ron Paul than most Republicans.      The idea that he is comes from Rush Limbaugh making sh*t up, as he so often likes to do, and then attacking his misrepresentation.  Obama is centrist.    And Ron Paul, while having many great ideas, did not bring people to the Republican Party like Ronald Reagan.  Now he is far more Conservative than Reagan, who was practically a Socialist.  But very few went for him, in or out of the Republican Party.    To his credit, the problem is not in his ideas.  His problem lies in his image.  He has a very whiny voice, and does A LOT of complaining.  Now everything he complains about is true.  But one can only take so much complaining, especially in such a voice as his, before they can't take it anymore and then they quit listening.      I currently don't see a Republican that can beat Obama.  Obama's ideas are too close to Ron Paul's, while at the same time he is much easier to listen to, that Ron Paul would fail as well.  He's a good guy with great ideas, but he will never be President.      There may be a Republican out there who can win, but I don't think so.  If I had to pick someone, I'd roll with either Mitt Romney or Bobby Jindal.  But Bobby Jindal doesn't want to run, and Mitt Romney showed extreme trouble in getting the Religious Right to back him.  And for the record, Ron Paul would have even more trouble with the Religious Right than Romney would.          Add-on:    I know what Ron Paul says, and he's wrong on Obama.  I listened to both of them, and Obama is far closer to his way of thinking than most believe about Obama.    Obama has strengths and he has weaknesses, but being far to the left is not one of his weaknesses.|`|QgD4Cbb7aa	I like Dr. Paul when it comes to Abortion.Dr. Paul is pro-life, who would know better than a Doctor nobody.Anybody will beat Obama in 2012.Dr. Paul  is a doctor not like the other so called doctors who kill babies.|`|2YyQAmufaa	Ron Paul is much more educated on the issues than Obama.

6b6ff719959d29a5aa770465d592c901aa	Stimulus bills have never worked. See europe, far east and big time Japan. Companies are not stupid, they  can see and project short term spikes in sales. They don't bring on staff for that especially when they see larger tax bills coming to pay for the stimulus. Wait a couple years and a couple more stimulus bills, then there are either permanent tax cuts or major depression.|`|BHBQPFzlaa	Not as much, and that's why it'll work better.    Bush's package absolutely failed, because most people took the money and paid off an old bill or saved it. This doesn't help the economy at all, since the money doesn't go to a company to pay someone's wages, and the employee spends it, someone else gets paid, etc...    We need actual goods and services to be purchased, and handing everyone a check has proven to be the WRONG way to do that.|`|5rXzu0IWaa	We will get 15000 in bills and a 1000 in tax cuts. Most goes to the rich.|`|45u7BzCUaa	$500 for individuals $1000 for families.  For individuals it's better than Bush's $300 but for families it's worse.|`|ghItgMZxaa	yeah it gives if you don't have a job|`|T4C4r5sbaa	The $819 Billion dollar stimulas bill also has a "buy american" provision which demands that any corporation wanting to get a piece of the government monies must only use American made products.  This is to ensure that American workers get those jobs rather than having the raw materials purchased from abroad.  It balances out the massive trade deficit we have with China (which is a part of our economic problem to begin with).  In this case, protectionism is good...very good...because Americans can get back to work and earn the paycheck to payback that stimulus money to the government rather than being on the dole.

This is something that has been upheld over and over again in the Supreme Court regarding search and seizure of lockers, purses, bags, etc.  Each time the court has said that the school has a right to search for contraband and confiscate it.  If it is something of value it would have to be returned.  In this case the teacher would have to return the tape to the parents of the students.  Try explaining that one to your parents.
b1d464d92abde2c75d6493dfe3d6c310aa	Most people don't know it but government itself is a limit on liberty, and therefore it's size and power are inverses of your own. The more powerful it is the less you are.    Every law it creates is a limit on liberty. Some are acceptable which is why humans choose to live in civilizations where murder is illegal for example. The government can take money through taxes but money gives us power though so this must be balanced. It is all a matter of opinion of how far government can and should go. Things must be considered which rarely are. Liberty vs. Security, Liberty vs. Equality, Liberty vs. etc. Were the balance lies in these things are important and usually aren't agreed upon.|`|rUNlmQG5aa	They do so by a very limited fiat and by all likelihood far under any public "radar".

How else can one explain the most recent Presidency, for God's sake?|`|BHBQPFzlaa	Like deciding who can get married?|`|P4vRH5Ufaa	The government places limits on our liberties in any way it can.  It is the nature of government to oppress its people.  historically speaking even the best governments corrupt and decay.  The constitution was created to protect the american people from this. 1st ammendment we can talk about overthrowing the government. 2nd ammendment we have the guns to overthrow the government militia, etc down the line
GiJ7thLqaa	No politician is above the Constitution, but they sure do act like it!  If a majority of voters thought their behavior was a problem, then these rats wouldn't be in office.  Just goes to show how little the population cares about the Constitution, also.|`|J758mw2Naa	Yeah people who own guns are "Freaks"...what the hell is wrong with some people.|`|YupMCYHlaa	When our Constitution was framed, a lot of compromises were built into it to get all 13 states to sign on.  One point of contention was whether the United States should have a permanent, professional 'standing army' or stay with its old system of temporary volunteer citizen-solders in militias commanded by each state.  Pro-militia people were afraid a standing army could be used by the president to take over the country, and they also observed (very presciently as it turned out) that nations with large standing armies were continually engaged in war so as to justify the cost and permanence of the armies.    The compromise was reached that the federal govt. -would- have a standing army, but states would also be allowed to retain their militias, which some years later were renamed the National Guard.    This is what the Second Amendment was all about, that states would be allowed to bear arms because a well-regulated militia was necessary.  That was it.  Nothing about citizens being able to take over the country, or people being allowed to own as many guns as they want.    The Supreme Court held this opinion until just recently.    When people say the govt. is ignoring the Constitution, well sometimes I think they're right. Other times, something happened that they don't like so they whine that it's unconstitutional.  The federal government has a perfect right to control the purchase and ownership of guns, just as it does with hypodermic syringes, explosives, narcotics, and about a million other things.  These things are not illegal, but access to them is controlled, for excellent reasons.    The ONLY politician that I can think of who expressely declared himself above the Constitution was GW Bush.  Hopefully this will not become a precedent.|`|VOccyg7daa	When have lawmakers ever paid attention to the Constitution. I don't think most of them have read it.|`|BUI2nlUVaa	You still have a right to keep and bear arms in this country.  The second ammendment doesn't talk about particular arms so politicians have been able to limit certain types of weapons, give waiting periods and background checks.  Just what we need a bunch of freaks carrying .50 cal machine guns to work.|`|AA11972175	No.  most people just don't read anymore|`|RgO3Sn38aa	I could kiss you for asking this question.  They THINK they are above the law.  But when 200,000,000 of us show them our guns, maybe they will think twice.  The reason the 2nd amendment came after the first is because of it's importance.  Tyranny can be stopped by "We the People." and it's our duty and obligation to protect and defend ourselves, our family, our community, the Constitution and our Country.  It is not the police's duty to protect individuals.|`|9HdexsSCaa	They are above the constitution as long as nobody calls them on it.|`|YnlT7m8raa	Stop throwing the Constitution in my face, its just a goddamned piece of paper! - George W.

Initiate a report or statement to a law enforcement officer concerning an offense or incident within the officer's concern knowing that: 1) the offense or incident reported did not occur; 2) the person has no information relating to the offense or incident reported; or 3) the information relating to the offense reported is false; or  ? Make a report or statement in response to a legitimate inquiry by a law enforcement officer concerning a material fact about an offense or incident within the officer's concern, knowing that the report or statement is false and with the intent to obstruct or hinder the officer from: 1) preventing the offense or incident from occurring or continuing to occur; or 2) apprehending or locating another person suspected of committing an offense; or  ? Intentionally initiate or circulate a report of a past, present, or impending bombing, fire or other emergency, knowing that the report is false or baseless and knowing: 1) it will cause action of any sort by an official or volunteer agency organized to deal with those emergencies; 2) it will place a person in fear of imminent serious bodily injury; or 3) it will prevent or interrupt the occupation of any building, place of assembly, form of conveyance, or any other place to which the public has access.

8MUj24s6aa	Pro 2nd Amendment...That's not funny!    "Yes We Can . . . Ban Guns"--Obama Announces Gun Ban Agenda Before The Final Vote Count Is In     Friday, November 07, 2008       Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign slogan, "the audacity of hope," should have instead been "the audacity of deceit." After months of telling the American people that he supports the Second Amendment, and only hours after being declared the president-elect, the Obama transition team website announced an agenda taken straight from the anti-gun lobby--four initiatives designed to ban guns and drive law-abiding firearm manufacturers and dealers out of business:     "Making the expired federal assault weapons ban permanent." Perhaps no other firearm issue has been more dishonestly portrayed by gun prohibitionists. Notwithstanding their predictions that the ban's expiration in 2004 would bring about the end of civilization, for the last four years the nation's murder rate has been lower than anytime since the mid-1960s. Studies for Congress, the Congressional Research Service, the National Institute of Justice, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found no evidence that gun prohibition or gun control reduces crime. Guns that were affected by the ban are used in only a tiny fraction of violent crime-about 35 times as many people are murdered without any sort of firearm (knives, bare hands, etc.), as with "assault weapons." Obama says that "assault weapons" are machine guns that "belong on foreign battlefields," but that is a lie; the guns are only semi-automatic, and they are not used by a military force anywhere on the planet.     "Repeal the Tiahrt Amendment." The amendment--endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police--prohibits the release of federal firearm tracing information to anyone other than a law enforcement agency conducting a bona fide criminal investigation. Anti-gun activists oppose the restriction, because it prevents them from obtaining tracing information and using it in frivolous lawsuits against law-abiding firearm manufacturers. Their lawsuits seek to obtain huge financial judgments against firearm manufacturers when a criminal uses a gun to inflict harm, even though the manufacturers have complied with all applicable laws.     "Closing the gun show loophole." There is no "loophole." Under federal law, a firearm dealer must conduct a background check on anyone to whom he sells a gun, regardless of where the sale takes place. A person who is not a dealer may sell a gun from his personal collection without conducting a check. Gun prohibitionists claim that many criminals obtain guns from gun shows, though the most recent federal survey of convicted felons put the figure at only 0.7 percent. They also claim that non-dealers should be required to conduct checks when selling guns at shows, but the legislation they support goes far beyond imposing that lone requirement. In fact, anti-gun members of Congress voted against that limited measure, holding out for a broader bill intended to drive shows out of business.     "Making guns in this country childproof." "Childproof" is a codeword for a variety of schemes designed to prevent the sale of firearms by imposing impossible or highly expensive design requirements, such as biometric shooter-identification systems. While no one opposes keeping children safe, the fact is that accidental firearm-related deaths among children have decreased 86 percent since 1975, even as the numbers of children and guns have risen dramatically. Today, the chances of a child being killed in a firearm accident are less than one in a million.    http://www.nraila.org/Legislation/Read.a...    ABCs local DC anchor Leon Harris asked Obama, "One other issue that's of great importance here in the District as well is gun control. You said in Idaho recently... 'I have no intention of taking away folks' guns,' but you support the DC handgun ban." Obama's simple response: "Right." When Harris said, "And you've said that it's constitutional," Obama is clearly seen on tape nodding his head yes.    Lott, John R.

64SObnr5aa	The reason is this    President Bush publicly introduces the new defense doctrine of preemption in a speech at West Point. In some instances, the president asserts, the U.S. must strike first against another state to prevent a potential threat from growing into an actual one: "Our security will require all Americans[to] be ready for preemptive action when necessary to defend our liberty and to defend our lives.  Jun. 2, 2002    Iraq was invaded on Mar. 20, 2003    Remember, a POTENTIAL THREAT, which means, he or Obama can now preemptively strike any country that we THINK may eventually harm us.    This is the first time in our countries history where we have gone from defensive to preemptive.    All we have to do is THINK a country is going to attack us.    The only thing that is preventing that now is Obama (I hope), we are stretched too thin, and our economy has taken a whollaping, in part, because of these treasury busting wars.    I really wish partisans would wake up and understand this.  But for some ungodly reason, they think the boogy man exists under most Muslims and governments that do not agree with us.

"Actually everything I have said is fact, look it up."    Looked it up. nothing you have said is factual.    "Why didn't we provide evidence though?"

BUI2nlUVaa	Private schools are already proving that it is successful.  Look at the graduation rate in Los Angeles, 48%, inspite of the highest per student spending rate in the country.  Private Schools in the same area, a staggering 98.5% with over 80% attending college.  Sounds to me like we're throwing dollar after dollar on a sinking ship.      Vouchers provide for competition and that is never a bad thing.  Public schools would have to compete for business and would therefore have to clean up their acts to attract students.  The only people against vouchers are the teachers and the teachers unions, powerful lobbying organizations.  They love the status quo because they don't have to do anything and they still get paid.  If I only succeeded at my job 48% of the time I'd be fired without question.  Why should they be any different.|`|xVRGz3Oaaa	Privates actually Graduate their students, Govt schools let them drop out.|`|7aed01780e0f597b42c6f8b57a2f4065aa	You might be surprised to find out that more than a few liberals support school vouchers as well, so your snide reference to conservatives only illustrates your prejudice.    School vouchers give parents the Freedom to Choose where their children can be educated.  This eliminates the need for an agenda-driven NEA and its force feeding multicultural crap down our children's throats.   Isn't Freedom To Choose a liberal stance?  Oh, only when it pertains to killing an unborn child, eh?  School vouchers allows those parents who care about their children's education, welfare, and safety to investigate a school to decide if It is worthy of their child, not commanded to do so by some overpaid, overstuffed windbag administrator on a power trip.  Plus, with vouchers, we can cut government waste like the Dept of Education.    It's a win-win for parents, children, and taxpayers.  It just requires one to wash the bullsh*t about public education from their minds and become more creative.|`|n5Fkuxz5aa	I would echo the sentiments that suggest choice would make for a better education system, it would work on a free market principle. As for rural schools, I have not seen how they could apply in most cases. Most American families live in either urban or suburban areas, so it doesn't matter to them. I could see how in a state that has urban, suburban and rural areas the rural areas getting the shaft as the state attempts to help public schools compete with voucher schools by pouring money into them (which won't work anyway). Any vouchers plan is going to have to address rural school issues to insure that they do not lose their public funding if they're the only viable schools in the area. But again, they only service a small segment of the population. Vouchers for rural people could be traded in possibly for grants to improve rural schools, that's the only thing I can think of offhand.|`|iZGGj1g5aa	There is no indication in the constitution that the government should be in the business of teaching our children.  It cites many things the government is required to do (roads, postal service, ect.) but education has always been left in the hands of parents and those that parents choose would best educate.  Today children in the ghettos have no chance at a worthwhile education because they live in "bad" districts and are not offered up vouchers for quality education.  They are, however offered vouchers on subsidized housing- keeping each generation doomed to the mistakes that the previous generation made, with little hope of escape.|`|lUe4rReZaa	Because it would introduce Choice and Competition into our schools.   Public schools would be forced to become innovative in how they teach students to compete with the more efficient and effective private and Parochial schools.  In areas where charter schools allow more choice for school enrollment they are so popular that there are often long waiting lists and even lottery's to get children enrolled.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	Your question assumes ALL conservatives support school vouchers.  Your assumption is wrong, since I do not support them, and I am a conservative.  This is why we should never deal in absolutes, my friend.    School vouchers are a terrible joke.  They allow us to ignore the problems in the crumbling schools.  Instead of giving out vouchers, we should fix what's broken.  If we get rid of people who have no business being teachers and replace them with those who are dedicated to their profession and actually do something to earn their salary, we would be a lot better off.  Bad teachers are the main reason why all these schools are failing nationwide, why our public schools in St. Louis City have NO...that's ZERO accreditation.    As long as we ignore the problem, it will not go away.    EDIT:  I answered because you mistakenly posed a question to conservatives, when you should have said Neocons.  They're the ones who j i zz in their pants over school vouchers. I was simply correcting you because, quite frankly, we conservatives hate having to share an umbrella with idiots like Sarah Palin.|`|kE29abUUaa	Privatizing everything would remove income tax.

MKrNZMVDaa	This is a bit of a tricky question to answer, but I'll try.    Earning  enough money to lead a comfortable but not extravagant lifestyle is important to me as long as it's not at the expense of other people.   It distresses me to see other people doing it tough whether it is through bad luck or bad choices.   It also makes me mad to see some people who never know when enough is enough and who are constantly fearful that their 'hard earned' money or wealth will be given to other people in the community who they perceive to be non deserving.  I wish these people could be more like Bill Gates who has a very comfortable but not 'over the top' lifestyle and who uses millions of his 'hard earned' wealth to help the poor and uneducated to improve themselves.     So I suppose I'm on the left of the political spectrum ... I'm not a communist ... probably more of a democratic socialist.|`|c41f84986e1b8e191747b9c81200eafdaa	Other people.

AA11875616	"Paying taxes is the rent you pay for your stuff on this Earth."  If you and your stuff take up whole city blocks of acreage, you ought to pay more, and not just percentages more but by proportionally more.  Taking from those who scratch bread crumbs to survive from day to day while you hog the whole table is both morally wrong and economically wrong.

Now if they decided not to do that, and just cut the social programs, much of the demand for the products the rich sell would vanish over night. This would cause prices to drop and the rich to lose much more money.|`|DB7UMkGCaa	"Since Republicans seem to believe that tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts are the solution to help the ailing economy, shouldn't they just advocate one to stop paying taxes or to pay significantly less than what is owed?"    We Republicans are law abiding citizens who go by the book. We may not like paying the high amount of taxes, or any taxes at all, but we pay it because we're obligated to. We do not advocate people break the law and just stop paying taxes. We do advocate that if one doesnt like paying taxes, or high taxes, you can always try to have the law changed, which is the legal and proper thing to do.    "If they go to jail, they could be considered martyrs, no?"    No. And who cares about having martyrs? Having a martyr doesnt really accomplish anything.    coalition writes: "After all, roads, schools and hospitals are paid for with taxes. Therefore we wouldnt have to see them on the roads, in the schools, or at the doctors office."    Wrong. How do you think those things were paid for before taxes? Why, through private enterprise. They had hospitals and school and roads and if the current taxation system were to disappear, those hospitals roads and schools would still exist and be paid for through privatization.     "Frankly I think its a great idea. And if one of them gets robbed, oh well...taxpayer dollars for the police...too bad buddy."    Sheesh. Again, we would have privatization step in, and/or we would defend ourselves.|`|hdUmMuN9aa	Well.. if we stopped paying taxes we would go to jail... so NO.    In addition, theoretically tax cuts result in the government making just as much.. if not more money from people spending that money to help stimulate the create of wealth. If people have less money they spend less.. resulting in business's spending less, resulting in the government making less.    At no point do they advocate spending no taxes. Tax money should be spent on roads, schools, national defense, and the like. Instead it's spent on global warming research, and pork barrel B.S. for political interest groups who 99% percent of the time are worthless idiots who accomplish nothing.     Then again if Obama cut taxes 100% for just a few months it would result in a massive instantaneous stimulation of the economy. Instead there spending it on roads, and more special interests, etc... Last I checked I already pay for roads.. That's what the gas tax is for.    Oh and..    The term martyr (Greek ?? martys "witness") is most commonly used today to describe an individual who sacrifices his or her life in order to further a cause or belief for many.     Do you expect us to die in jail?|`|c654465d22c58a2c5b0af285003b2789aa	That would be sweet!

The reason for ships being referred to as 'she' these days is probably more to do with tradition than anything else, but I find it hard to imagine a scene where a salty sea captain gets all affectionate and gooey eyed and says to his men 'The ship came through the storm boys - he held us close and dragged us through again!' or even on seeing a new ship for the first time - 'Look at those lines - he's a beauty! I can't wait to get inside him!' And why? Because we have some way to go before women and men are statistically balanced in the numbers of jobs of power, particularly in the Armed Forces. There's been a start, but it's decades off. This nonsense about a 'gender neutral' ship is just a lot of guff to feign equality in area which will never have equality and smoke and mirrors to stop you asking the real questions - can we afford it and do we really need it?|`|EBqFpZbjaa	So it's an IT now?    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=zevSwdt_FA...

Although a recent outlandish and wrong-minded Supreme Court Ruling may alter this definition, Eminent Domain has always been the right of the Government to take land or other  property in an effort to provide for the common defense or build up the infrastructure. By "Takings Laws," they must compensate the owner fairly, and they can only take land to build a school, a road, or some vitally-needed military or public building or campus.

Each state, city and county has this right as well.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Eminent domain allows a state to obtain private property, expropriate private property, or seize a person's rights to a property for fair market value but without needing the owner's consent.

AA12109395	He was probably doing some recon for a possible burglary. Probably just checking to see if anyone was home. This is EXACTLY what a criminal does when casing a housing. If this happens again, try to get a general description or the license plate of a car without being obvious or putting yourself in any danger. Do a police report.|`|XFZmAMOAaa	Sounds like thats what happened.Talk to your neighbers and let them know about the incident.Better safe than sorry.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	It sure sounds that way.|`|TtI7VtTfaa	No..    He was lost..|`|CpTQagJOaa	yes...it definently does...I would consider getting an alarm system if I were you and report this activity to the police and ask them to patrol your street more often.|`|JDltTREfaa	It's a distinct probability, but even if this guy does have criminal intentions, it's likely that he's looking for unoccupied houses.  (Most residential burglaries occur during the day when people are at work.)    GOOD FOR YOU for not opening the door to people you don't know/aren't expecting.  You would be considered a "hard target," meaning that criminals are not likely to focus on you.      Anytime there is someone suspicious in your neighborhood, do not hesitate to call 911 and report what you've seen.  Too many people try to rationalize what their instincts are telling them and don't want to appear silly by "crying wolf."  If this guy is 100% innocent of anything and has a reason to be in the neighborhood he'll only be inconvenienced for the five minutes it will take an officer to verify that.|`|VOccyg7daa	You might report that as suspicious activity to the police and get yourself a big dog. The best anti-theft device for your house is a dog.|`|AA11644291	Definitely report that to the police department. They can send out an extra patrol every so often to make sure nothing happens.|`|NdC2s0F5aa	That sounds suspicious, it could of been a neighbor wanting to know if you had something he could use, maybe he needed help. Perhaps he was examining the area to make sure nobody was looking to see him there while he tried to do something. that's something I would do probably, (Never theived in my life)  Most likely it was nothing, and wait for your husband to be home to answer the door just incase, and have something handy incase anything is to happen, you want to be safe at all times, and don't want to be living in fear. Someone just robbed my truck of a sterio a few weeks ago, I wish i had a camera, you might want one of those if you want to take it to extreme levels.|`|b3a4e3954118fb9fef3e435ed488eeadaa	Call the police and report the individual and let your immediate neighbors know what you saw.  You don't say that you actually answered the door. It sounds like you just peeked through the peephole or the window.  It's possible that the person was lost or had the wrong address. It's possible that he was casing the place. What did your husband say? What exactly was suspicious? The fact that he was unexpected, wearing a sweatshirt or was it something else?|`|zokJMPBAaa	sounds like someone was watching your activites,what time your husband left who was going to be a home at that time,it's been probably going on for a while,the police can set up a small ops to catch the guy,let the police know what's going on,he has to be caught in the act,take care of it yourself to keep your husband from beating the crap out of the guy and he will end up in jail|`|wg78UkxFaa	You may want to call the police and let them know what happened.  You may also want to let the other neighbors know what happened as it will allow them to also keep an eye out for this person, it will also allow each of you to help keep an eye out for one another as well.    Maybe install a camera on your front porch as it may deter the person from trying to do any thing when they see the camera.  Get a large dog that will bark if when they hear some one messing around.  It may make some one think twice before they mess around by your home.    Also when you talk with your neighbors talk about getting together a neighborhood watch program, its a good thing for any neighborhood.    God bless.  Stay safe and always pay attention to what is going on around your home as well as your neighbors.
ffuaQiMCaa	I agree.     And I consider Obama's Stimulus plan as a different approach than Bush's Bailout.    Bush bailout = injecting money into economy in a top down direction = failure because CEOs and bankers are greedy fat cats who put that money in their pockets and continued to fly around in $50 million+ luxury jets while laying people off    Obama stimulus = injecting money into economy in a bottom up direction = potential success because if every low/middle class people have jobs then they will have money to spend and they will go out and buy stuff and businesses will thrive, because that's what really drives an economy. Plus our infrastructure will get a much overdue upgrade at the same time!    If you ask me, the middle class really doesn't exist anymore. Most people consider themselves middle class when they technically fall in a category closer to lower class. Low class doesn't necessarily mean you are living in a trailer park or a cardboard box. If you have a car, but don't really have the money to put gas in it... you are NOT in the middle class and voting for tax cuts actually benefits the rich and does nothing for you. We need to invest in infrastructure, energy and most importantly invest in our own citizens by creating jobs. We also need to wean ourselves off our dependency on foreign oil. We are never going to do that if we don't put some money into domestic energy upgrades. HELLO!    I'll work at a government sponsored green energy company. Sign me up!    We should have invested in infrastructure years ago instead of war on Iraq... which never had WMDs BY THE WAY!!!|`|aH8MWUataa	I want the money....|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	More Debt is not an investment.

It will stimulate the economy for about a year at most, then the gains will be over.    Cutting taxes for businesses would be much better. Instead of stimulating the economy by re-sodding the National Mall for only the 6 months it would take, the tax cuts would last until the economy got back on it's feet.

Since World War II, none of the recessions that have hit the U.S. economy have lasted more than two years. Most have lasted 12 months. The new mega-injections of government investments championed by Obama are intended to break the momentum of a recession were probably more than half-way through suffering.    The Congressional Budget Office crunched the numbers and concluded that a huge bulk of the federal spending orgy wouldnt actually kick in until the recession is waning  if not already over.    Take a stand against Holder and the Obama-Pelosi false stimulus bill.    This plan is the old-style pork-barrel spending -- not stimulus:    ? $6 billion for colleges/universities -- many which have billion-dollar endowments.  ? $166 billion in direct aid to states -- many of which have failed to budget wisely.  ? $50 million in funding for the National Endowment of the Arts.  ? $44 million for repairs to U.S. Department of Agriculture headquarters.  ? $200 million for the National Mall, including grass planting.    House Democrats plan will cost each household $6,700 in debt, which will be paid for by our children and grandchildren.     Create or save 3 million jobs -- which means this plan will spend $275,000 per job.    It is crucial to recall the reality that lies behind the rhetoric. The media is still cocooned in a warm comfort zone of infatuation with Americas answer to god himself. We should be long past applauding politicians of any color. They got us into this mess. The best deserve a probationary opportunity to prove themselves, the worst should be in jail.|`|tDZMJue9aa	i think its called TROUBLE they already are saying it will take more..how much more should we give a plan before we say hell no...we are talking generations into the future paying off what has been passed in the last few months..obamas change mantra seems to be going with what was there already..spending on a big fat *** nothing...a bunch of ear marks...probably less than half is going toward our bridges etc...|`|AA11942937	You sure do have high hopes for earmarks........an investment?  Only for those benefiting from specialized earmarks.    Pouring token money into a bunch of areas isn't going to fix anything....only prolong the misery.    I haven't seen anything that the stimulus package will fix.    Is now a good time to give millions to hospitals and insurance companies to computerize their records?  I think not.|`|cgb4WOnVaa	It was wrong last fall.. and it's still wrong.

Here's a thought... if we want a stimilus package lets put that 12% in and throw out the rest.      As far as it being an investment... If you couldnt pay your bills would you be investing your limited income or paying your bills? Why should the government do less?      Is this change or just the Dems paying off their base for support?|`|FUL3Ez2Iaa	Those kinds of projects do create job, but critics argue there is relatively little for those kinds of projects in there: Of the $819 billion package, $30 billion has been set aside for infrastructure spending.    Among the funding measures included in the proposal are $25 million for new ATV trails; $400 million for the National Endowment for the Arts; $400 million for global warming research; $335 million for the Centers for Disease Control to combat sexually-transmitted diseases; and $650 million coupons to subsidize TV viewers for digital television conversion.  How do you think these are going to stimulate the economy?    We are setting out children and grandchildren up for failure.  Their tax dollars are going to have to pay for our sins.  And do you think they are going to actively seek employment when the majority of the money that they earn is going to be taken by the government to pay for the bills we are running up?|`|aI6QFXClaa	Don't do it, we are spending money that OUR grand kids,  children are going to have to pay.|`|Nr8XlhAxaa	My thoughts:  How come nobody mentioned Willie Nelson's corn?|`|QlPTVcrHaa	From what I've gathered from reading differing accounts...    http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&tab=wn...    ...the general consensus is that the tax breaks need tweaking, some pork trimming is in order, and the "long term" provisions need to be cut and introduced as follow up legislation.
w87icQkoaa	I'm in the process of joining the Navy, actually. I've talked to a recruiter over the phone, and he's calling me back tomorrow to set up a meeting with him. I think you should go Navy.    For a good look on what the navy does go to http://navy.com/careers/    The Air Force is good also, but very hard to get into. Their demand for recruits isn't as high, and all the jobs are mostly technical. You need high ASVAB scores to get any good jobs in there.    The Marines is basically just ground and pound. They're the first ones in, and the last ones out. They are the ones who get killed the most. They do the most killing. Therefore the Marines is the most dangerous.    As far as which branch ranks up the fastest. That is not so much which branch you choose. It is more about what rate (job) you choose. The less in-demand the job is, and less people are in it, the faster you'll rank up. Also, putting you to use all depends on what rate you choose, not necessarily the branch.    Navy boot camp is 8 weeks.  Air Force boot camp is also 8 weeks.  Army boot camp is 13 weeks.  Marines boot camp is also 13 weeks.    The safest branch is definitely the Air Force.  The most dangerous is the Marines, as I stated before.  All branches have the same benefits, basically.    Army & Marines don't have as many jobs you can use in your civilian career after retirement.    Navy & Air Force have a lot more options on civilian careers you can use afterward.|`|mm5p5sy6aa	Which branch puts you to use the quickest:All of them need people, all of them will use you ASAP  Most dangerous:Depends on your MOS. For instance an air traffic controller is far more safe than a cavalry scout  Best Benefits:Army|`|AiqQgy0faa	AF does combat landings in combat zones like Iraq.  You can rank up in the AF quick if you can test well and can retain information you read.  that's all it takes, read something and test on it.  I believe it goes AF, Navy, Army, Marines for boot camp quickness.  they all "put you to work" as soon as your done training you up.  depends on what job you get for the safest.  if you are finance your safer than someone in the infantry or on the front line.  they all have the same benefits, it's all base dependent on which base is better for housing, BX/PX, clinic, etc.|`|0Ad0SrEfaa	by service desertion rates    http://usmilitary.about.com/od/justicela...    also, suicide rates are highest among Marines, then Army, then Navy then AF|`|Z1FYjWmJaa	I have friends in all branches of military, and the one I've heard the fewest complaints about is Air Force.|`|BMkVOR0caa	Coast Guard  Boot Camp is only 8 weeks!   If you like the air you can always do something in avaiation in the USCG!|`|rgmI03Ulaa	coast guard. still work on the water but no long deployments. Can still fly and you get to arrest drug runners|`|A6UPTz4caa	I can only vouch for the Marine Corps. I was promoted to E-2 at three months, E-3 at 9 months, E-4 at 1yr 8 months, E-5 at 2yrs 10 months and E-6 in under 6 years.    The Marine Corps has the longest and hardest boot camp. 3 months long. However, it has been made easier by Mothers of America.    Depending on the MOS you choose will determine how long until you get "put to use." I had 3 months of Boot Camp, 1 month of Marine Combat Training, and 3 months of MOS training. I joined in September and started doing my job in May of the following year.    The Marine Corps and the Army are the most dangerous. Marines are invaders and destroyers. It is our job to kill the enemy.    All branches recieve the same benefits on a certain level; however, the Marine Corps gets the worst gear and the smallest budget. Therefore, we are considered poor compared to the other branches. Air Force personnel that are stationed with Marines get extra pay because of "Hazardous living conditions."    All in all, I love the Marine Corps. Everytime I see a sailor, airman or soldier I say to myself, "Thank God I joined the US Marines."

21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	Ok. I was stationed @ Fort Stewart for 4 years and I hated it until I left (one of those you dont know what you have till its gone kind of things). Now I want to go back. Doesn't make much since but turns out I really miss the area.   On post housing is great there... dont let the old housing fool you (it looks horrible)... because they have built all brand new housing that even includes garages (which is a rarity... because here @ Fort Hood we dont even have a car port)   Hinesville (the town right outside the main gate) is small with not much to do. There are a few restaurants but that is about it.   Richland Hills is pretty nice (have a few friends that live there and thats where I always got my hair cut) and that is about 30 minutes away.   Savannah is fantastic on the weekends. There are always festivals in the Historic District. You HAVE to go to Bay Street Blues (karaoke bar...the bartender Bonnie is awesome) and Wet Willy's (on River Street) We always had a lot of fun there.   In the summer you can drive the hour to Tybee Island and have fun on the beach and theres also fishing off the pier.   Hilton Head isnt too far, Jacksonville is an hour (great zoo!), Daytona beach is a few hours, as well as Orlando (military has great discounts @ Sea World and Disney World!)   The area is great in terms of being able to go to a lot of really neat places within a few hours of home.

And those mortgages were put on the market for an investment bank or company to buy   .  So they could reap in the tons of money in interest when that low interest rate jumped threw the roof  .  One day 10 years latter   that home owner got a min. payment that was 80% higher than it was last month  .  So default plan started to be put into action  .  And all those investment companies are now holding a lot of property deeds  .  And no money to cover the cost they paid when they brought those  .  And these are companies world wide   .  A couple of million of these were put on the market for any investment firm to buy  .

aTAUOI8caa	Muslims come in all races, just like Christians.      Obama has shown us a birth certificate, and it has been independently verified by a number of sources (the FBI and the Hawaiian government among them).    And his mother was American.            This reminds me of the case of Leo Donofrio.  Mr. Donofrio brought a suit against Obama saying that Obama was not an American citizen.  While Donofrio conceded that Barack Obama, Jr. was born in Hawaii (as proven by the birth certificate he saw), Mr. Donofrio insisted that it didn't matter.  That would be because at the time of Barack Obama, Jr.'s birth, his father (Barack Obama, Sr.) was a British citizen.    Therefore, Barack Obama, Jr. must be a British citizen.      Well, the Constitution and the Supreme Court have come up with a number of scenarios in which someone would be a natural born citizen of America; but for our purposes, we will only need one.      A child born on American soil to at least one American citizen is a natural born citizen of America.    Well it turns out that Barack Obama, Jr.'s mother was an American citizen, by virtue of her having been born in Kansas.    And it also turns out that Hawaii is American soil.  For confirmation of the fact that both Kansas and Hawaii are American soil, you can check pretty much any map or globe.      So by admitting (again because he saw the birth certificate) that Barack Obama, Jr. was born in Hawaii, Mr. Donofrio admitted everything necessary to prove that Barack Obama, Jr. is a natural born American citizen and that he himself was a complete idiot.      May I suggest that you learn the lesson that Mr. Donofrio did not?|`|L7BSLB6faa	From www.factcheck.org    Born in the U.S.A.  August 21, 2008  Updated: November 1, 2008  The truth about Obama's birth certificate.  Summary  In June, the Obama campaign released a digitally scanned image of his birth certificate to quell speculative charges that he might not be a natural-born citizen. But the image prompted more blog-based skepticism about the document's authenticity. And recently, author Jerome Corsi, whose book attacks Obama, said in a TV interview that the birth certificate the campaign has is "fake."     We beg to differ. FactCheck.org staffers have now seen, touched, examined and photographed the original birth certificate. We conclude that it meets all of the requirements from the State Department for proving U.S. citizenship. Claims that the document lacks a raised seal or a signature are false. We have posted high-resolution photographs of the document as "supporting documents" to this article. Our conclusion: Obama was born in the U.S.A. just as he has always said.    Update, Nov. 1: The director of Hawaiis Department of Health confirmed Oct. 31 that Obama was born in Honolulu.|`|qcLP5j8zaa	No, but we should send GWB and company to prison.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	I wish the courts would do something about educating people, so they don't make irrational statements.

I think I will have YOU deported.   Your answer to that? You don't have to prove anything to me, because I am not the govt. That would be correct. If you don't choose to show me your proof, you have that legal right. It is called an OPTION.   You are correct that the courts will not do anything about it. There is no law that Obama has to show you his private records. You are totally correct that the courts are not going to waste their time, making up fake laws to satisfy you.   "He's not really an American" is your hallucination. People don't get deported because you want to make up your own laws and false conclusions.

Now talk about something interesting for a change.|`|IUXriZQJaa	Now that he is a sitting President, he would have to be impeached and removed before anything could be done to him legally.    It is sure he never showed us a birth certificate. What he showed us was a certificate of live birth, which Hawaii only issues to children born abroad. Even that was forged. The border is from onw year's document and the background is from another, and neither is from a document from the 1960s.  The designation "African" would not have been used. They would have written black or N e g r o . The pixelation around the writing is enough alone to prove the document was poorly cobbled together on a graphic arts program, and the obvious and amateur dodge-n-burn job along the border is insultingly poor grade.   Surem Fact-Check said it was legit. Obama used to chair its parent Annenberg Foundation. He has similar relations with Snopes.com and several other 'Hoax-buster' sites.  The fellow who calls this insane dreams is foolish.     That much said, no, muslims are not typically Arabian, but I would challenge you to read the Quraan and the Hadiths and see what level they put the Arab Muslim on and where they see all others.      I think the next 4 years are just going to stink. We may well see our country collapse under Obama.    -----  EDIT to respond to a lot of nonsense posts  -----    McCain was born in Panama, yes, in the Canal Zone, which until  Jimmy Carter gave it away was U.S. Soil.

And they aint't Arabs. Do you realize that the country with the 2nd largest Muslim population is India? And they ain't Arabs.    Obama's father was from Kenya. I'm not quite sure if Kenyans are considered Arabs or not.    Obama was born in Hawaii, to a Kenyan father and an American mother. Since he was born on US soil, to an American mother and a father that was not a representative of a foreign government, he is therefore 100% American.    So, no. You cannot deport a US citizen.|`|FdQD8H3qaa	Why does his father being from Africa over rule the fact that his mother was American and gave birth here....

And to answer your questions about abortions, they are older than the Hypocratic oath.  Hypocrites said that no doctor should participate in an abortion, this part of the oath has since been removed.  Most people only know "first do no harm".|`|IDZTtipeaa	People who commit acts are responsible, largely, for those acts.

Apparently a lot of people did so recently with the ex president Bush.|`|U60KCkdcaa	Most people who blame Bush read the comics and the headlines in the New York Times only. On occasion they may read about their favorite sports team.(sarcasm, people who follow sports are more informed than the average democrat).    I find it funny, especially now that Obama is proposing to give 5.2 billion dollars to his private army, ACORN that defrauded the last presidential election, by registering thousands of illegal voters and the democrats have nothing to say on the matter. ACORN also worked with the two government shell companies MAC and MAE in shaking down the banks in threatened law suits if they did not lend money to minorities.    Bush was not the cause of this current crisis for the most part. Yes, he did spend lots of money before the banking collapse, but it did not cause the housing crisis. Under Bush, he cut taxes, and kept our economy strong for 7 years, with low inflation and unemployment.|`|0Ad0SrEfaa	are you slow or just home-schooled?|`|o6fkps1Oaa	you partly right; but it was the republicans who had a chance to regulate fannie mai but they didn't. why? because somehow barnie franks stopped the entire republican party. haha.  Bush should not take the entire blame, but the fact he is the "head' of the government and "head" of the executive branch, he did not take any initiative for the economy.  All he cared about for most of his presidency the was the Iraq war.  When you are the president, your number one job is to protect the country, but dont EVER forget...you are the CEO of the country.  When the country falls apart, you are its leader and are suppose to keep it together.  Bush failed at that during 911 and he failed at it in the economic crises.  It is not the conservative or liberal principals you can blame...it is the people.  And THE person who could've prevented all of this was former president Bush.|`|7P518NRmaa	It's not just the housing crisis that caused this mess. IT IS THE WAR BASED ON BUSH'S LIES THAT COST US TRILLIANS OF DOLLARS A MONTH! Not only that, but the economy tanked under his watch. He did nothing to stop it. He did not attempt to do anything to stop it. The most he did was push through the Auto Bailout, which is the most useful thing he has done in the entire 8 years he ran the country. He turned the surplus that Clinton left us into the deficit.    Perhaps you should stop watching Fox and listening to Rush Limbaugh.|`|5lflypTiaa	Most Americans realize that Bush was the President. It's his job to monitor the economy. How hard is that to understand? That's what he was there for. Bush attempted to regulate them? Really? Well, he completely  failed at that, didn't he? Some leader. Seems like he was ineffective.I don't agree with your argument, but if the guy in charge can't do anything to prevent what happened, then he really was useless, wasn't he? Barney Frank had more power then the President and the Republican controlled Congress? Really? Do you realize how really bad that makes not only Bush, but the entire Republican Party look?

6LTaPSaeaa	Grades and classes will have no weight when it comes to enlisting.  All that matters is your ASVAB score, that will tell the military what you are qualified for.  After you take that and they start inprocessing  they will tell you what jobs are available that you qualify for.  Thats when you get to choose.  Benefits are free medical, free food, and a place to live.  Not to mention the possible opportunity to travel the world.  Negatives are deployments and high risk jobs should you choose one, not to mention relationships if you have one are extremely hard to maintain in the service.

Put it this way, I scored a 93 on the ASVAB and they let me choose my job.  Don't stress the test because it isn't bad at all and I thought BMT was a blast.  It's hard and demanding, but what in life that's worth it isn't?  It's better to go and miss four maybe six years of your life and leave with your college paid for, great friends, and fond memories verses always wondering if you could've landed that job at NASA.  BTW, I got offered that job and I skipped half of my high school education (and not for academic reasons).  So, that's why I say it's all a matter of mind and determination, you'd be amazed where it gets you.

DTSUJe2oaa	DNA Evidence Part 2: DNA in the Courtroom How do Defense Attorneys Successfully Challenge   DNA Evidence? DNA evidence has taken on mythic proportions in the   courtroom, the media, and the public eye. There is a   widespread belief that DNA evidence can be used to make   or break a case. As Kim Kruglick notes in her Beginners   Primer on the Investigation of Forensic Evidence: Crime lab reports seem to have this aura of   invincibility about them that lead few trial   lawyers to confront their conclusions head on   in front of a jury. Maybe its because some part   of us believes that the reported results are   based upon scienceOr maybe its because   we tremble at how excruciating high school   chemistry wasOr maybe, jut maybe, its   because we simply dont realize how extremely   vulnerable to challenge the crime lab work   product really is. In fact, the presence (or lack thereof) of DNA evidence does   not definitively establish guilt or innocence. While DNA evidence can be very daunting, it is not infallible. Mistakes   can and do occur in the testing, analysis and presentation   of DNA evidence. Often, it is up to the defense attorney to   discover these mistakes and bring them to light. This fact   sheet offers suggestions for defenders faced with DNA   cases and offers suggestions for building a strong DNA   defense.   Collection from the Crime Scene and Transport to   the Laboratory Thoroughly examine the chain of command used in   handling the forensic evidence. The more hands it has been through, the more likely it is that it has been contaminated.   This is especially serious when labs use PCR based   methods  by amplifying a sample, a miniscule amount of   contamination can easily become a huge problem. In   examining the chain of evidence, points to consider include:   ? How was the evidence first discovered?     ? Who collected, packaged, labeled, transported and stored the evidence? How was it done?   ? Who removed the evidence from storage and transported it to the lab for testing? ? Once at the lab, who handled the documentation of the evidence before testing?~|`|SIK1A02yaa	With PCR technology only a tiny amount of sample is needed to run tests, which means it can be very easily contaminated.  Analysts have their own DNA profiles on file at the lab in case there is suspicion of contamination.  There are investigators and evidence collectors who may contaminate the DNA sample also.    Analysts use enzymes as part of their tests and if there are inhibitors it can make the results all screwy.  If a DNA sample was collected from an item of clothing, the dyes in the fabric could be enzyme inhibitors.  Usually these can be removed during extraction but not always.    But mainly lawyers look for mistakes.  Is the scientist's math perfect?  Did he/she forget ANYTHING on the report.  Did he/she say something in another court case ten years ago that contradicted what was just said?  The weak link in the DNA profiling technique is the human component, so instead of attacking the DNA evidence itself they try to make the analysts look like they aren't competent enough to tie their own shoes.

9tcv3TiWaa	If you are looking to go into the medical field in the Navy good luck, the HM (Corpsman) for women is currently closed because there are so many in it at this time.  It has been closed for awhile.  If you are looking at doing something else then it depends on what you want to do.  If you are looking at it for education purposes you are not always going to get a chance to study or take classes, especially while on deployment.   It can be difficult at times, good at others, yes there is good benefits.  How much you enjoy yourself depends on how you like your work, showing respect, and your attitude.|`|KM8uZ4fVaa	Pros are that women can do most of the jobs in the Navy that a man can; I can tell you the cons in one word: Tailhook.|`|TpdvK4Wxaa	my husband is in the navy and i am pro-military as well.  to answer your question, you can't beat the benefits.  the schooling and health care alone make the navy or usaf top dogs.  if you love to travel and want to see a lot, pick a job in the navy on the boat, you'll definitely get around.   if you want to learn and travel, try my husband's job.  he's aw aircrew on a p3 orion.  he loves it.  there's two parts to the job acoustic or nonacoustic, one primarily with radars the other with a headset.  aircrew isn't that bad physically and i met a few of the females that were in his class.  they didn't have anything bad to say about it and liked being treated like "one of the guys".  that's the only gripe i have with the military, it's too politically correct, after the third time of being asked if that statement offends you, you'll understand too.  so, for that being my only gripe, i'd have to say it's a great opportunity.  hey go talk to a recruiter.  they have a program where you can keep going to school and get paid, you only have to dep in.  you don't go until you finish your schooling.  i know they offered that in various engineering jobs, but they might for health care too!
BUI2nlUVaa	Yes you can petition the court to award your mother sole legal and physical custody and therefore she would be able to sign the papers.  This should take about 2 months to sort out.  Your mom would have to be the one filing it.  She can do it Ex Parte (without an attorney).  It should be fairly simple.  It would be easier to try to convince your dad to just sign the papers.  Tell him what you plan on doing and let him know that he'll have to make the trip to North Carolina to appear in court so you can tell the judge what you want.  He'll probably relent since he hasn't been that committed to you previously.  Good luck to you.  BTW...just to clarify you're not seeking emancipation you want your mom to have 100% legal (this has nothing to do with where you live but the ability for your mother to make all legal decisions for you)custody.|`|2daf1f643b0222e20fe97c10246019f0aa	See an attorney.

But, why not give college a chance, and THEN make up your mind!  I hope you have been reading the papers and listening to the TV, there are so many yourng men and women being killed while in the Military!  I can quite understand your father's feelings.

And, in my never-to-be-humble opinion, no law was violated.    Since we are not in Germany and we are not in WWII-era Germany, there are no Nazi SS Officers that person COULD send to you.  This is what is known as an idle or empty threat.  There probably was no crime committed.

So, they figure that the conservative viewpoint is getting out and being accepted by America while the liberal viewpoint is getting out, but is being rejected by America.

Dems don't give a damn about GOP credibility.  They are just afraid of the opposing viewpoints turning favor away from Obama.  Obama is needed to save the Democratic party.   They can't allow support for him to drop.   And it's always been "open season" on conservative talk radio.   That's no real threat.

He looked at all sides and spoke to his concerns on all sides. We actually enjoyed watching him. He was not antagonistic, didn't speak rudely of others, just gave opinions that might cause people to think, but never acted in a way that caused a one sided discussion. It was an interesting talk show. Over the years as he grew in popularity he began making more money. From that point it should seem obvious what was going on.   Just last July, he signed a new 8 year contract worth well over $400 million, with a signing bonus of $100 million.  In my opinion, as he's gotten older, his views may have changed that's true, but also, when one is getting paid that kind of money, to bring in the revenue for the people who pay him, it's logical to think that he also says many things and acts as he does to continue doing just that. It's called smart business, and greed. I personally don't think he believes many of the things he says.   But when he stirs up hatred in the ways that he does and fuels fires in derogatory ways, I don't consider people feeling threatened by that, but more insulted.  It's a shame really, because as I said, many moons ago, he was actually a 'thinker' who took the time to ponder situations and actually bring about a discussion, now it just seems to be mindless conversation that riles people up, with some thoughtful tidbits thrown in once in awhile.  My thoughts on what President Obama said, to not listen to Rush Limbaugh, I think was actually suggesting that they think for themselves. Something Mr. Limbaugh once encouraged himself in a bi-partisan manner many moons ago.   The key word there is bi-partisan. We have one President at a time, not everyone has to like him, but since we are all citizens in the same boat (country) that has great concerns currently, should we remain divided or work together. The petition from my understanding, is simply for that purpose, to stop division. Mr. Limbaugh stated "I hope he fails" regarding President Obama.  In all due respect, while I was not overly fond of the Bush administration, he was my President for 8 years and I did respect him as such.   I don't follow the difficulty in understanding that concept.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con...

The indolent behavior was actually on the part of:    Carter who enacted the community reinvestment act which forced banks to give loans to people who could not otherwise qualify.     Bill Clinton who made the community reinvestment stronger and more powerfull making banks give even more bad loans. Also for appointing Jim Johnson and Franking Raines to run Fannie Mae. They cooked the books paying themselves millions of dollars in bonuses that they were not entitled to.    Acorn for using the community reinvestment act to blackmail and bully banks to give even more bad loans.    The Democrat party and mainstream media two years ago for protecting and lying about what was going on at Frannie Mae to keep Republicans from reforming it and killing their cash cow.    Barney Franks, Pelosi, and Chris Dodd for investigating the problem that they, the Democrat party, and mainstream caused and protected and of course found themselves not responsible for.|`|r7I7FoNMaa	We may never recover from this 8 years of indolence.|`|NXGCUotGaa	um i never cared for bush but you need to get your facts straight.    1999 clinton pushed for removing all tariffs and trade restrictions with china. move forward in time china now owns us and they flooded america with there stuff which helped destroy american jobs. took time but it has devastated are economy and job growth in america.    allso in 1999 a bill was passed that forced banks to lower there lending practices so low that they were forced to give fraudulent loans just to satisfy the federal goverment or fannie freddie garbage. which in return the goverment had to pay for. bush warned about it 3 times even had congressional hearings on it and was always blocked from doing anything about it.    the high gas prices that seemed to happen over night bush allso warned would happen within the first year he took office if we didn't drill due to global riseing demand anything that had to do with drilling was always stopped and the high fuel prices bush warned us about did happen. they voted on drilling 3 times?? this allso helped destroy the auto industry in a period of about 1 year when they almost trippled in a single year.     so even though you say this is republicans fault its not    but to be honest this is all happening by design. they want are econmy to fail because it gives the goverment a chance to take control of us and take away even more rights from us...     everything thats happening is because of the nwo.. its all by design|`|mUMMLjDdaa	polar bear, i couldn,t agree with you more. the bush administration  has ruined the american and world economy.|`|2pWMhDcEaa	It is well summarized in "Idiocracy", nominally a silly comedy about Army Private Joe Bowers, who wakes up 500 years in the future, but really a brilliant tragedy about the aftermath of 500 years of Republicans:    Narrator:  Unaware of what year it was, Joe wandered the streets desperate for help.

My Uni degree would be meaningless but I'm currently in recruitment for enlisting as a Reservist in the army. I imagine that would help somewhat in such a situation. Personally I would ally myself with the army considering my employment, I would imagine that the authority would remain unless it's organization structure had fractured into factions ie, civil war. From here I would establish an endeavor for military rule, to reestablish order and maybe usurp power of the nation if the armed forces were ambitious.    Personally the suggestion of complete loss of order in the near future is ridiculous, only after a catalysts such as a Revolution, Nuclear War/ Fallout or other major upheavals of authority would such an event be instigated by society. Even in the United States and other western nations were individuals own firearms such a suggestion is unlikely.    You might as well prepare for more likely disasters or if you feel such an event is going to happen just prepare. Stockpile equipment which would come in handy, mostly sandbags, firearms, body armor, camouflage netting and clothing, food, rations, a shelter and a good plan with friends/ family would be good places to start.
UwsbuHZYaa	Well the Constitution says that congress has the right to COIN money.  Not to print it. The FED is unconstitutional and should be abolished immediately.  The constitution of the United States has vested in congress the power "to coin money, and regulate the value thereof." Art. 1, s. 8.    Act of April 2, 1792, 1 Story's L. U. S. 229.    1. 9. That there shall be from time to time, struck and coined at the said mint, coins of gold, silver, and copper, of the following denominations, values, and descriptions, viz: Eagles; each to be of the value of ten dollars, or units, and to contain two hundred and forty-seven grains and four-eighths of a grain of pure, or two hundred and seventy grains of standard, gold. Half eagles; each to be of the value of five dollars, and to contain one hundred and twenty-three grains and six-eighths of a pure, or one hundred and thirty-five grains of standard gold. Quarter eagles; each to be of the value of two dollars and a half dollar, and to contain sixty-one grains and seven-eighths of a grain of pure, or sixty-seven grains and four-eighths of a grain of standard gold. Dollars, or units; each to be of the value of a Spanish milled dollar, as the same is now current, and to contain three hundred and seventy-one grains and four-sixteenth parts of a grain of pure, or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver. Half dollars; each to be of half the value of the dollar or unit, and to contain one hundred and eighty-five grains and ten-sixteenth parts of a grain of pure, or two hundred and eight grains of standard, silver. Quarter dollars; each to be of one-fourth the value of the dollar, or unit, and to contain ninety-two grains and thirteen-sixteenth parts of a grain of pure, or one hundred and four grains of standard, silver. Dimes; each to be of the value of one-tenth of a dollar, or unit, and to contain thirty-seven grains and two sixteenth parts of a grain of pure, or forty-one grains and three-fifth parts of a grain of standard, silver. Half dimes; each to be of the value of one-twentieth of dollar, and to contain eighteen grains and nine-sixteenth parts of a grain of pure, or twenty grains and four-fifth parts of a grain of standard, silver. Cents; each to be of the value of the one-hundredth part of a dollar, and to contain eleven pennyweights of copper.

aTAUOI8caa	Usually something special attracts the interest.      Someone getting shot in the street or stabbed at a bar is still considered murder, but no one cares about those guys.  We assume they were doing something stupid and got what they deserved.      Now a Caylee Anthony case has a cute white girl.  And I know that sounds racist, and it is, but we are who we are.  We are getting a little better about it; not too long ago I heard about a case in which a black teenager was killed.  But mostly it remains cute little white girls that get the attention.      Or in the case of that woman killed while trying to protect her son from a sexual predator.          These are interesting stories, with victims that you can care about.  So they get our attention, and that is what the news goes with.  I can envision my own daughter when I see Caylee, or envision my own mother trying to protect me.

Most are just gang shootings. Nothing riveting about that, at least not to the viewers. The news channels just want ratings.|`|FZ0hwowaaa	It's a decision of the journalist based on newsworthy or not. If not newsworthy they don't care.
cpfwyFo7aa	i have a permanent disabled placard, i was in iraq twice and i have gone through operations and surgeries du to explosions and attacks. I'm 21 years of age and i have all my body parts, and i get that look from people when i park in handicap areas, but i cant walk for long distances and i have a titanium rod in my in my leg. but i think those people that drive some siblings car should get cited, and that is against the law for the carrier of the handicap permit as for the violator. its a $650-$800 fine according to the DMV handbook|`|BHBQPFzlaa	The permit is for the vehicle, not the driver or passenger(s). Sometimes the permit is actually on the license plate (depending on which state you live in) -- obviously not removable if an able-bodied person is driving the car once in a while.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Not all disabilities are obvious.  Someone could have congenital heart disease, which makes it difficult to walk long distances.      And yes, it is illegal to use a disabled space/permit unless the disabled person is driving or in the car.|`|CpTQagJOaa	Many people have severe back problems that prevents them from walking long distances.|`|6SB4ufEYaa	I have a chronic illness. I look perfectly healthy on the outside. Inside.. i feel like i'm dying.     I have been shouted at SO many times for parking in the disabled spots. Because i don't 'look' disabled.    Some illnesses don't show on the surface you know??|`|HP9eT8eLaa	Yeah, you can't judge just by looking at the person.  I know what you mean though because you KNOW there are lots of people that abuse the sticker they got for someone else's use.  But there still are people that do have problems and they aren't always obvious.  I know when my back went out one time, I could drive but walking was tough.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	if you drive on someones permit then yes you can get in trouble.  i look perfectly fine but i have end stage renal disease. heart disease and i broke my neck in 2004.  i walk a little slower and not as long as i could.  on a good day i park in normal space and let the space go to someone with more disability.  i haven't figured out where deaf and mute get handicap permits.  the things i remember from application was how far you could walk and physical things like that.  i've known a lot of deaf and mute and don't see any of them having trouble walking, unless something else wrong with them.
AA10709853	DEPper Action Request.   it is just that..a request.    the only way you could go earlier is if a slot opens up in A school.  That would mean somebody else slated to go DC fails to ship or fails to qualify for DC.      you can literally get 24 hours notice..and often they will say.. A slot is open, I need an answer in the next 30 seconds whether you will take it or not.

Don't be dumb.|`|70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	You can't sue or press charges against anyone at 12 years old, your parents would have to do that.    If the police were involved, they would most likely tell the parents to handle it.    You have no cause for a lawsuit, behave yourself before you both end up in juvenile hall.|`|BUI2nlUVaa	Nothing is going to happen if one twelve year old punches another twelve year old.  The cops will take each of you to your parents and let them work it out.  Monetary damages are only awarded to people who sustain major injury or damage due to reckless action of another.  You'd have to prove that the 12 year old was reckless and acted out of malice.  In other words if a kid punched you in the nose because you called him a jerk, grow up.|`|817cba953d47b19d42283b382144cae4aa	None dumb $$. The person commiting assault will go to jail. The person gets punched can sue in civil court but is unlikely to see any real reward.|`|749nTZQ9aa	dude im scared to answer this ? you might sue me.|`|Msu6RB1Qaa	You are talking about two separate issues  1. . The criminal assault in which the D.A. determines if charges should be brought before a judge or if there is a plea. Unless there was a visible physical harm and witnesses probably nothing is going to occur.    2. The civil case in which you or your parents hire an attorney for a fee or part of the settlement. Because the person is twelve years old, their parents are sued for physical/mental damages and if there is sufficient medical evidence and documentation the court MAY rule that court fees and actual damages be paid.  These cases are very rare, because there are few lawyers that will take on this type of case against a minor and their parents.

He treats looking for a job AS a job.  He's gone on a ton of interviews, but they all tell him the same thing at the end of the day:  he's OVER qualified.  Right now he's making money preparing people's taxes.  It's not steady work, and it's not as much money as he's used to, but it is a blessing.  We have to thank G-d for it.

No, because now the Dems have a comrade to rubber stamp every spending spree they ever wanted.

The old president also tried to instill a perpetual sense of imminent danger, and that fear is tearing us apart, not bringing us together.

Why wouldn't you go to the office and demand a paycheck?  Maybe you could call the local news channel and get "Bobby the weather guy on your side" to settle the matter?  Maybe you can send a certified return receipt letter to them asking to be paid...see if that helps.

But we won't mind recession. After we get out of the depression, a recession will seem like a piece of cake.<br>  <br>  The Government gets their money from our paychecks.<br>  <br>  The Government has not one dime. The money is ours. If there is a debt, it is ours the taxpayer.<br>  <br>  Look at your paycheck. Where it says Federal taxes. State taxes.<br>  This comes out of every ones paycheck. The Government should use this money to benefit Americans. <br>  <br>  Some always needs to go to debt. Some back to infrastructure. Some into our programs that help our public. Some goes into Education. It goes into so many things.<br>  <br>  When the Government needs more money. They raise the taxes. Your taxes on your paycheck will increase. Both State and Federal taxes.<br>  <br>  With the amounts being borrowed. We will never pay this off.

NOT A SINGLE THING.  No product to sell, no service to sell, no source of income other than the theft of peoples hard work and labor.<br>  <br>  Third, if you run a business, and you have no product or services, then you will go broke.<br>  <br>  Fourth, creating jobs in the government sector was arguably the reason the Great Depression lasted over ten years.<br>  <br>  Fifth, Had F.D. Roosevelt, not implemented government jobs and regulations, by the time he was inaugurated as president, the economy was turning around. By following a small portion of obama's plan, FDR guaranteed a prolonged Depression which only ended when the Democrats took us into war because of their soft stand internationally.<br>  <br>  Sixth, I don't expect you to believe me, just watch as the Stock Market reacts and tells you how stupid this governments plans are if you expect to put people to work.<br>  <br>  Seventh, and MOST IMPORTANT,  WHY SHOULD I AND OTHERS WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE WITH OUR SPENDING AND DID NOT BUY HOMES, BOATS, DRUGS, CIGARETTES, OR VID.

With all of these bailouts, companies will not have the desire to work hard, because they know if they fail, there's a government bailout with their names on it waiting to be signed. Successful companies won't have the incentives to work hard and continue being successful, and eventually our economy will actually be as horrific as Obama is painting it to be right now.|`|otYOxmnuaa	Jessica -- the CBO (Congressional Budget Office), the base financial institution of the U.S. Government, said this will fail.  You can't ignore the numbers and power through on "hope".  If the numbers say fail, 99.99% of the time it means FAIL.<br>  <br>  And as for tax-cuts being a solution, the program pays for itself in inflation-adjusted dollars in five years at which point it brings in MORE tax-revenue than before.  It's amazing how individuals put their money to work when they have more of it.  Common sense, right?  If you have an extra $200, what do you do?  <br>  <br>  It was proved during Reagan's years and again in our last 8 years under G-dubs.  So do we stick to a tried-and-true approach, or do we experiment w/ 5-generations worth of tax-revenue and base it on a "hope" that things will turn out okay?

However, other big corporations have to stop gouging us to death....such as oil companies......If you are smart enough to think back when the demos regained control of congress, they all ran on, "fixing gas prices"  Did gas prices drop...not a bit...under their control  they did nothing, and gas prices rose to an all time high of over $4.00.  Can they do something about it....sure.....why do you think gas prices dropped so much during christmas.....it was because the government knew that in order for everything not to fall to pieces faster, they had to get the oil companies to drop the price of gas, and they did.....and yes the govt. can force them to do it again.|`|AA12176505	Because you should be self-sufficient.

Officers are commisoned as officers and are more of managers.  jobs for officers are not open to warrant officers for the most part.  warrants are usually like Mechanics, pilots, detectives.  officers have specialist jobs like Lawyers, doctors and dentis, but they are usually not expert of anything except commanding units.    you don't need any degree to be warrant officer, however, you need to hold NCO rank unless you wand to go as an aviator.    officers need 90 college credit to commission through OCS and Bachelars through ROTC.|`|Nejnh1Bqaa	Warrant Officers are officers, but they are considered technical experts and are highly specialized, that is they work only in one specialty.

Msu6RB1Qaa	Maybe you should listen to the complete conversation of Rush. Rush sad he hopes the socialistic polices and ideas of President Obama fails because he wants our country to remain a capitalistic republic democracy.    I doubt there are many individuals in this forum that claim to be as American as I am. My family has fought for this country in every major war starting before the War for American Independence. We have often shed our blood and in some cases given our lives for our belief in the Constitution.  What have you and your family done for this country?  I consider myself a moderate with lean to the conservative side.|`|So9MR55Xaa	american first.  Sorta in the middle second.

Conservatives did not want the bail out back then, the reason it passed quickly was because democrats passed it.    The reason it's not going over so well now is because the corporations that claimed they were in dire need gave out big bonuses to the idiots that got them in debt to begin with and it makes the democrats look even stupider.    Conservatives have no problem paying their bills, it's the democrats always asking for free money cause they can't figure out why they should have to pay bills.|`|7aed01780e0f597b42c6f8b57a2f4065aa	Limbaugh didn't state that he hoped that Obama's plan failed, he said it would fail.    Your question borders on the ridiculous.  Whether a person is a political conservative or liberal is secondary to being an American citizen.  By pidgeonholing people into choosing is asinine.    That said, and with a nod to Mr O'Brien and his dumbass comment about Bill O'Reilly, Obama's plan will NOT help the country out of recession.  It will only make it longer.  Count on 3 to 5 years.  Bush did not bail out anyone.  The stimulus bill he passed was authored by a Democrat Congress, which wanted to send checks to people who were dropped from the tax rolls by Bush.  He signed it because he knew the Dems had enough votes to override a veto, so he saved us a waste of time, which Congress has become very good at doing.    I don't listen to any talk radio, Limbaugh or otherwise, but I support a person's right to choose what he or she wants to listen to.   If you don't like what you hear, turn the damn dial.   That's why I choose Not to listen to half wits like Keith Olbermann.|`|FUL3Ez2Iaa	I am an American.  And a conservative one.  Now, put Rush's comments into their proper context.

Its a matter of common sense. The plan will fail and has failed many times in the past. Two off the top of my head is Germany and Japan.  You cannot fix an economy by increasing govt spending and throwing more fiat money after already over diluted economy.  Hope isn't going to do it either.

My boss and I at some other time had a conversation about sexual harassment. I told him I would never waste my time reporting sexual harassment to him because many of our female customers had made a lot of complaints of some really egregious behavior, and the company had done nothing to protect them.

Sine that time They have kept us in fear, and accepting of threats to our basic liberties. They've made us fearful of outsiders, suspicious of non-Christians, and averted our attention away from the greed that that has reduced our economy to shambles while the privileged profit.

Media coverage for celebrity births is greater than ever before, and it seems that every television show has run with a pregnancy related plot-line.

ZOXoPgJbaa	I used to think it was crazy, but the more I do research, the more I believe it to be so. There is a reason William Cooper was killed months after it happened.    If you dont know the William Cooper story, he was a former military official who in june of 2001, heard that a CNN person had spoken to Bin Laden, and that Bin Laden supposedly said that he was going to attack us. Cooper knew at the time that Bin Laden was already a wanted man for the 1993 attacks, and said in an interview that The CIA FBI, ETC has been looking for Bin Laden for 8 years, but some CNN guy went into a cave and interviewed him? He didnt believe it and told Americans to WATCH OUT , and that something big was going to happen and it was going to be done by our government. Sadly it did, and two months later after 9/11 , when William started doing speeches about 9/11, WIlliam Cooper was gunned down in his house....    Aaron Russo, also dead now, was told by Nick Rockefeller, about an event that would occur, which would lead them to take the pipelines from the caspian sea and Iraq. Dont forget the Rockefeller's own Exxon Mobil, formerly Standard oil, and David Rockefeller is the leader of the CFR, of which most the leaders of the world, the media, and the academia are members of.    Also in Bin Ladens confession video, he starts writing with his right hand, when Bin Laden is left handed. And also, Bin Laden needs a kidney Dialysis, so he would need to be in a hospital, but yet, hes been able to survive in caves this whole time?    also the whole wtc was pulverized, and there was molten steel, but they supposedly found the passport of one of the terrorists, unscathed, do you guys really believe that?      It could have been crazy muslims that drove the planes into the building, but I believe it was someone else behind it.  http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nD7dbkkB...|`|ff4620d7ef5c56f9405c2f52615552f5aa	There is lots of overwhelming evidence that says so.|`|CpTQagJOaa	No.|`|13920962b7119a1b4d44ad9700a88994aa	No, you have been listening to Rosie haven't you.  lol lol lol lol|`|nTzTIrataa	"I think a building that size does not fall with a plane"    You think wrong.

Hormidically sealed  Multiple professional organization say that the pancake affect was not possible    =========    What people do not realize, is the reason 911 happened and why the truth is so damning to our country.    War for profit  An oil pipeline  Oil and control of the middle east.  The only way that could be done is to put fear in the people. The people would not have put up with an invasion of two countries --- that is, till we were given a reason.    911 is an inside job, done by very powerful people.    I always tell people this --- don't believe me, look into it for yourself -- look at both sides --- look at it critically.  If they do that, they will come to believe things do not add up.  I used to believe the official version, now I don't.  It is not just one piece of evidence, it is a whole bevy of evidence that needs to be answered by a non partisan independent investigation given real authority to get to the bottom of this.    There are so many reason to believe we are not being told the truth.  Yet people who do not know or believe the media and our government version and refuse to consider anything else are the ones saying, people like myself are nuts.    Yet, what is really nuts, is not that, but believing that it was the work of terrorists with box cutters and our military did not intercept the jets ----------- WHY? Why were the planes not intercepted, when in that same year 86 planes were intercepted within 10 to 15 minutes?    That is just one issue, what about the hole in the Pentagon? It was not large enough. What about the lack of wreckage? How in the world did the plane get through our defense system when the Pentagon is the most heavily defended building in Washington, maybe even the whole country? Why is there no footage from the aprox 90 security cameras that actually show the jet hitting the building? The footage supplied to the media does not show the plane, it only shows something that is not identifiable.    What about WTC 7, the third building that came down? The 911 report never even mentions that.    So many unanswered questions.    =============    I invite anyone who does not believe 911 was an inside job, or at the very least not believe our government was involved in a cover up, to look into the issue objectively and critically, like I did, and then draw your own conclusion.    The facts are damning, the official report is trash.    =============    I'm telling you people, one day this is all going to come out and instead of being generally not accepted, the conspiracy of an inside job is going to be accepted. Just like the WMD's who the majority of the people believed in, but today they know we were led down a deceptive road.    Why do people selectively believe our government and media, when both have been shown to be deceptive at the least, and liars and fabricators at most?    ==============    Peace  Jim    .|`|e4hyq5hsaa	No. Anybody that thinks this was an inside job deserves a slap in the face.|`|F5JXQUEAaa	Yeah man, I believe so.|`|JnuU4c5raa	There is a history between Osama Bin Laden and the Bush family that goes back up to 20 years before 9/11.

In addition, Chicken Little was right.  The sky IS falling!!!    Bulletin!!!

Nor is it the first time that the world trade center was targeted.    Personally i find it amazing that a sole called aeroplane hits the pentagon walls and not one full sizes piece of aeroplane is found on site, supposedly disintegrated... but there was a passport, simply there on the ground from one of the said terrorists?    There are too many discrepancies. Too many.    The main argument against it, is that it is absurd to think a government would do that to it's people. Demonise anyone that could possibly propose such a horrid thought. Even if there are honest people around that want to tell some truths it is doubtful that it will happen, simply because they would know the damage it would cause to the country they are trying to protect.    Also it is easy to snub someone as a conspiracy theorist but considering more than two people were involved, it is, by it's nature already a conspiracy.    I would like some explanations as to why there was an explosion on one of the towers reflecting onto the aeroplane that still had not hit the tower though. Seconds before, the other building that was brought down in a controlled explosion and the fact that the fueld on board could not of generated such heats needed to melt the columns.    It's that old saying, there is not smoke without fire. If your senses tell you something is not right then most of the time it isn't. More people think there is something not right with the whole thing than trust the official account, that in itself will give you most of the answer.

A public defender generally will have neither the time nor interest necessary to work on a dismissal or abandonment of charges.                  With no record, a decent alibi and maybe one or two witnesses you can put yourself in a strong position to see the charges dropped or win  acquittal by creating a  reasonable doubt of either the alleged circumstances or witness/victim credibility.                  This seems hardly earth shattering but is deserving of attention. This is not anything you want on your record.  I see potential anger management course as your worst case scenario or suspended jail sentence. Real behind bars imprisonment very highly UNLIKELY.                   Your magistrate provided good advice. Follow through...                     Good luck.

The good news: There was great music that came out in the 30's    The bad news: Hitler came out of the 30's.|`|ff4620d7ef5c56f9405c2f52615552f5aa	I heard about 2015...|`|yeYL8Udoaa	vary soon if people would stop being so damn greedy...|`|FdQD8H3qaa	The only way is if people stop living the way they are and change.  This country got here because people think that they are owed something and don't want to wait to get it.  People look at what their parents have and think that they should get the same things right from the start and not work their way up... So many people are living way above their means..  They need to start saving and get things that will last.  Stop living a disposable life and get back to basics.  There is no reason to have a Hummer if it is just you and your spouse same as there is no reason to have a 5 bedroom house when you have no kids and not intention of ever have any.  The sad thing is that the average house size has gone through the roof when the average family size has been shrinking..  My grandparents raised there family in a 3 bedroom house with only one living room and an eat in kitchen and they all were fine... why do we now need  a house full of rooms that only serve one purpose.. and have both people working full time for said house that they never get to use because of how much it costs.....   People got into the housing mess because they were told that in theory that they could buy a $500,000 house but really should have only bought one that was half that... or they went into adjustable rate mortgages  so that their payments would be smaller and they could get a house worth more money.  The housing thing is really just the market correcting itself.  Once people come to a balance with what they want vrs what they can afford then the economy will right itself|`|NqNbIp2caa	This will not be the worst recession. Between 1929 and 1932 the US GDP fell by more than 25%. That is an 8% contraction per year. The worst estimates for next year are -1.6% from the IMF.  http://sg.news.yahoo.com/afp/20090129/tt...  As for those quoting 5 years or more before we are out. Again this is ridiculous.  Following the Great Depression steady growth began in 1933 (less than 4 years after the onset) and GDP had regained its pre crash levels by 1936.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gdp20-...|`|EeQ6qL52aa	8 years.

Let's see, last year was Bush's $700000000000 bail-out. So next years should be around $1000000000000.

I bet by summer things will look much better.|`|Msu6RB1Qaa	Don't believe all what you hear, the world is not in the worst recession ever in history.  The worst recession in history turned into a depression during the Great Depression.  You do not see soup lines, do you?  You do not see massive number of citizens stealing food, do you?  You do not see 50 % or more of the population income being reduced by 50%.  You do not see labor camps, where men traveled hundreds of miles to live and work to get enough money for their families, do you? You do not see adults abandon their families and children in stores/churches/businesses, because they can not feed and house them, do you? You do not see 35% of the population homeless, do you?  Of course not, we are better off today than our ancestors in the 20's and 30's. These are scary times, but the nation is strong.|`|fUh7LHzvaa	I think the recession will end within 2 years and start to moderately grow again after that.

That was the worst recession the country has experienced.  Now to answer your question.  It all depends on when people will begin to start spending their money.  Even the banks are starting to lower their interest rates so people will borrow money and spend their way out of the recession.|`|FUL3Ez2Iaa	It is not the world's worst.  It is not even America's worst.  The recession was much worse when Reagan took over and the recession in the late 30's lead to a depression that only ended with our involvement in World War II.|`|A5W8LQzVaa	It's when we stop thinking we're very much affected and we decided to make life to go on.

And it has been gone for a very long time.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	The Federal Reserve has the capability of printing money out of thin air thats why it's not gone.|`|xjcZkmpbaa	Good question.  It's amazing to me how misunderstood this concept is.|`|2p5VsmZhaa	Money is connected to gold and silver. As long as there is so much gold and silver, there is that much money. When you buy something with money, you're really trading gold or silver. If you just print money, without anything to back it up, items cost more and then the whole system's out of whack. That's how some countries are now. If the gold and silver are lost, then some of that money is worthless. Back a long time ago, you could trade in bills for gold and silver on the spot. If no <br>  one had any gold or silver, then that money was worthless paper. That's how it works.
wg78UkxFaa	I would say that there is more to the story than he's telling you.  Most likely he doesn't want to share it all with you, he may feel that you won't approve with what he's done.    You may want to find your self a new boyfriend, one who's not going to do stuff that's going to get him into trouble, one who won't  make you feel betrayed.    I'm so sorry that he's done this and made you feel this way.  You have every right to be up set with him.  As I've said find some one who won't do this to you.  I wish you all the best.  God bless you.|`|WqdKoil9aa	Your bf getting locked up is just the first in opening your eyes and removing the rose colored glasses.  He is only telling you what he thinks you can handle.  You need to think what kind of life you want to have and think more of yourself.  Don't justify what he is doing and isn't telling you.  He is not worthy of you and you need to count your blessing this was revealed to you now.  Close this door and the sooner the better.  Right now, do not feel sorry for him and move on.  Surround yourself with people who love and support you and go forward with him.  If you had been in the vehicle with him, you probably would have been locked up too.  This has happened many times to innocent people being with people selling drugs or having stolen property.  Do you want to be a felon because you love him?|`|AA10811674	He isn't telling you something, like there was jewelry and tv sets in the car or something like that.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	You can believe me. There is WAY more to the story. Something in the car indicated they were thieves. If the police arrested every one they saw with tools and boxes the jails would be full of innocent people.|`|2d643fe2509c39d5e9d2affcc16d13bcaa	Yup.. There's more to the story than your hearing. The whole jail system is gridlocked. They are NOT going to hold someone in there on that kind of bail for some tools... Unless it's thousands of dollars worth and the owner has identified them.|`|BUI2nlUVaa	He's lying to you.|`|JDltTREfaa	Was your bf arrested for robbery or possession of stolen property?  Robbery is a very serious offense.  Essentially, it means the police believe that your bf and his friend either used force or threatened to use force to take something that didn't belong to them.  If your bf was arrested for robbery, it also means that the police have a victim.    How about you look into this for yourself - that way you don't have to be stuck in the middle?    My recommendation is that you submit a public records request to the police department asking for the police report that was prepared by the arresting officer.      All you do is to send a letter to the police department that says something to the effect:    "Dear Sir or Madam, I am submitting this public records request to you for the purpose of obtaining a copy of the police report that was prepared regarding the arrest of (your boyfriend's name and date of birth or age and, if you know it, the friend's name and date of birth) on January 27, 2009.  I have enclosed a self addressed stamped envelope for your convenience and would appreciate it if you could send me a copy of that report to my address.  Thank you in advance for your cooperation."  Then provide your name, a mailing address and a telephone number.    (As an FYI, every state has some version of the Public Records Act.  Essentially, it states that private citizens have the right to review almost any government document and it states that government has an obligation to allow citizens to review those records.  There could be a small fee to get this document.)    His name and the name of his friend will be almost certainly be redacted (blacked out) from the copy that you receive, but you will be able to read for yourself exactly why the police officer arrested him.  This would be a great way to have concrete proof and you won't have to agonize about whether your bf is telling the truth or your friends are right.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Lynn is correct. There's way way more to the story then either you know or are telling us. Cops don't just lock someone up for having tools in there car. It seems with these question we never actually get the whole story. Your boyfriend is in a lot of trouble, perhaps you should consider someone a little more less felon-like.|`|uRh1xCf8aa	Barack Obama plans to issue an executive order on his first full day in office, directing the closing of Guantanamo Bay. He said he needs the money for new prisons to hold Democratic mayors and governors|`|npktPruMaa	There's definitely more to the story.  They can only hold you for 24 hours without charging you with something.  So if they're holding him past 24 hours then they've arrested him and have charges against him.  Your friends are right that there's more to it.|`|AA11644291	I don't believe that you can be arrested just for having tools and other equipment in your vehicle. That brings up a concern with probably cause, i.e. whether there is sufficient reason to believe a crime is committed. I'd agree strongly with your friends in that there is more to the story. Skepticism is a good thing to use liberally, especially regarding law and law enforcement. If it is the case though, that there was no robbery, the tools should not have concerned the officer, the case will be thrown out. If not, which is the more likely scenario because police officers don't usually arrest people for no reason, he will have to do the whole "Law & Order" thing and work this out. Hope this helps somewhat. And I'm sorry this happened to your boyfriend. I hope it's just a big misunderstanding. Don't worry, nothing is ever as bad as it seems. :)|`|cO186jeaaa	sounds like burgluary not robbery, and yes it is a crime to posses burglary tools. slim jims, crowbars, screwdrivers. lockpunches, ect.
RvShEWESaa	Did you win the case?<br>  If you didn't you lost, and there is no money.<br>  You need to first talk to your lawyer, and find out how the case is going.

I think your afraid to call them or neglected to, and they haven't even sent in a demand package.<br>  The information you give tells me that your a victim of your own negligence.|`|24cfb9540386b800bb43a544c412b806aa	mAT is right. It depends on what happened in your case since 2005. Did you win the case? Then there were medical liens on the case that the lawyer had to pay with the amount you won. Did you lose? Then that's a different story. Have you contacted this lawyer since you sued? Has he contacted you?|`|aDhZIhQcaa	What your lawyer did is unethical and he should be reported to the Bar Association.

Get another attorney and sue the previous one based on unethical behaviour and misrepresentation and also, sue for reimbursement of all expenses and for the new attorney's fees and court costs.  Trust me, your old attorney should be bonded and insured and they will probably settle with you so that he can maintain his reputation.  Grow some big kahuanas and don't take any crap.

1CVOHoapaa	In the first instance no. A formal caution would normally be given by an inspector or above following you admitting the offence. It would also normally be given in a police station and there is a bit of paperwork involved.<br>  <br>  In the second incident it is possible. You may have been cautioned as part of the release procedure. If a crime had been recorded, (which it would have been possibly common assaul or ABH), then the police would want a detection against it. A caution is a way of detecting the crime for Stats.<br>  <br>  The caution would also allow the police to take and keep your FP, photo & DNA.<br>  <br>  I am guessing that you may be filling in a CRB form. If this is the case go to the police station with the form and some ID. (passport or photocard driving licence with counterpart), explain the situation and they may check their crime information system for you.<br>  <br>  Note if the answer is no then you should request that your fingerprints, photo and DNA records are destroyed.<br>  <br>  If it is a crb it is important that it is correctly filleed in as if you put down no cautions and one shows it may be seen as a form of dishonesty.|`|2Jh7YH9yaa	When i had a fight once at college, i was cautioned and they took finger prints off me, i was at the police station for about 4 hours, when they cautioned me i got it written on a picece of paper, cautioneds are only supposed to last 3 or 4 years i think, i wouldnt of thought you will of been if you didnt get anything given in writing and as for the cannabis i know lots of people who have got caught with it and they just get it taken off them and nothing else said ( what a waste ) and as for you gf my sister has been in a simlar situation with her ex, they used to fight and police were involed and again he just got warned not to do it again and he already had a bad past with the police, as she didnt press chargers on you or anything like that i reckon you wont have one, have you tried looking on google about it? <br>  :-)|`|91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	To be formally cautioned in England and Wales you have to admit a criminal offence and sign a document acknowledging that your are being cautioned. The caution is formally administered by a senior officer at the police station.<br>  <br>  I think you would remember all that, so I doubt it.<br>  <br>  If you're asking because you are likely to be CRB checked, be aware that if the employer does an "enhanced" check your bit of bother is likely to show up; this is because an enhanced check not only includes any criminal record you may have but also anything known about you to the police.

VWLCwLNMaa	Portugal. Brazil was colonized by Portugal. Brazilians speak Portuguese and not Spanish like the rest of South America.  But, people were already there when the Portuguese claimed Brazil. So the population consists of various Indian tribes mixed together with Portuguese. I'm sure they also have some African and Spanish heritage also.|`|WxrRRMZUaa	well of course you have white people in latin america, i dont know why americans have the idea that all latin americans are mestizos, anyway... white brazilians are usually from portuguese, italian or german heritage|`|UEDUvVxaaa	Well their official language is Portuguese and yes they are a nation of immigrants.  There are probably a lot of inter-racial couples in that nation.|`|29yMjFInaa	It's most likely that their distant family came from Spain. Spain is part of Europe and many native Spaniards are light skinned with blond hair. I actually have a friend from Spain and she has blond hair and has very light skin. Because of the distant European heritage they could be from Brazil and still have light skin.    If you want to think of it on a biological level, many different genes go into determining skin color. There is also the chance that the genes can be hidden by another gene. So in the case of skin color, the many of the genes that code for that trait can be experiencing an incomplete expression.

Punishment could range from a verbal counseling by a supervisor to criminal charges appropriate to the assault.    The category of what constitutes police brutality is large so you will have to be specific for a better answer.  For an example of what I mean, putting a pair of handcuffs on too tightly could be called police brutality.  So could the beating of Rodney King.|`|HZvMciZ9aa	Most of the time, they don't.    But in all fairness, most of the time, the guilty people they arrest for committing brutally violent crimes get off easy.  Not all of the time, but most of the time.    And most of the people the cops are unnecessarily brutal to practically BEG the cops to kick them to death.  Not all, but most of them.    To answer your question though, I don't know.  i get the impression from fictional tv shows though that when accusations are formally made, there is an internal investigation.  Internal being the important word.  But those are just tv shows, and are usually full of crap.
9VRwBeATaa	In some provinces it's 18. I think that is the right age.

At the age of majority a person can vote, make a contract, get married, join the forces and die for their country.  Therefore, in my opinion, they should be able to have a beer.  If Canada is going to raise the drinking age to 20 they need to make the age of majority 20 in all Provinces.|`|73W7ReR9aa	I think it should be lowered to 16.

m3znBkunaa	Driving on a suspended license is a class 1 misdemeanor.  That carries a penalty of up to $2,500 fine and one year in jail.  Normally the jail time is 30 days with some or all suspended.  As far as the probation goes, a condition of the probation normally is not to get any further charges during the probation period.  If his probation is violated he will receive any outstanding suspended sentence from his prior conviction.

ab407d966f7a7da9c12993692322a29caa	moskit is known as the ss_sunburn , it is a very fast anti ship russian made missile, its speed is mach 2.5 which makes it the fastest anti ship missile in the world.it is so well desighed that once it reaches its target it makes violant manuvers to counteract and self defences the target might have so its virtualy undestroyable.|`|f89b352246306e490163cf6ea4f2ecbbaa	The Moskit (Mosquito) (NATO reporting name SS-N-22 Sunburn) is a Russian supersonic ramjet cruise missile. The missile system was designed by the Raduga Design Bureau during the 1970s as a follow up to the SS-N-9 Siren. The Moskit was originally designed to be ship launched, but variants have been adapted to be launched from land (modified trucks), underwater (submarines) and air (reportedly the naval variant of the Sukhoi Su-27). The missile can carry conventional and nuclear warheads.<br>  <br>  The exact classification of the missile is unknown, with varying types reported; this has been due to the secrecy surrounding an active military weapon. It is one of the missiles known by the NATO codename SS-N-22 Sunburn. In NATO analysis the Moskit is one of the most feared weapons due to the potential of quick elimination of friendly naval fleets due to its high speed. The Moskit was designed to be employed against smaller NATO naval groups in the Baltic Sea (Danish and German) and the Black Sea (Turkish) and non-NATO vessels in the Pacific (Japanese, South Korean, etc.), and to defend the Russian mainland against NATO amphibious assault. [1]<br>  <br>  Variants of the missile have been designated P-270 (P270), 3M80, 3M80M, 3M82 (Moskit M) [1]. The P-270 designation is believed to be the initial product codename for the class of missile, with the Russian Ministry of Defense GRAU indices (starting with 3M) designating the exact variant of the missile. The 3M80 was its original model. The 3M80M model (also termed 3M80E for export) was a 1984 longer range version of the missile, with the latest version with the longest range being the 3M82 Moskit M. The ASM-MMS / Kh-4 variant is the air launched version of the missile.<br>  <br>  The missile is reported to have been purchased by the People's Liberation Army Navy (China), as well as by Iran.

T8nap2Pnaa	It may be possible, but in a situation like this you really should talk with a good immigration lawyer. His chances of coming back legally would depend largely on why he was deported. some things can be forgiven, and some can't. first you would  need to file an I-130 immigration petition and then wait for a year or so for it to be processed and sent to his country. then, he would be interviewed and turned down, as he's been deported and he was here illegally as well. then, you would have to file a waiver through USCIS, but depending on why he was deported, he may not be eligible for a waiver. so, rather than spend all your time and money on something that may not prove to be possible, check first, and then decide what to do.|`|AA10045620	There is nothing you can do except wait out the ban.

In either country?    If he's not subject to a 10 year ban file an I-130. You will also need to file a W-601 but I don't know if that is part of the I-130 or the I-485 package.

The British Army was one of the best armies around, to be sure, but the British were unable to deploy their full strenth to the colonies.  They had lots of other committments (in India, the Caribbean, etc), and also had to keep a considerable force at home to protect from Spanish or French invasion.  As a result, they were able to deploy only a fairly small force to the Colonies, and were forced to suppliment that force with very expensive Hessian (German) regiments and with unreliable Tory units and with very unreliable Indian forces.  <br>  <br>  2.  Asymetrical Warfare.  The militia forces fought a largely geurilla type war against the British, and even Washington's conventional Continental Forces seldom gave battle unless they had some sort of advantage, and when they did, they were careful to keep their route of retreat clear.  This meant that the Americans tended to hit and run until such time as they had numerical superiority, and then they struck with the sort of fury one might expect of a people who felt they were being invaded by a foreign army.  See Saratoga.<br>  <br>  3.  The British commanders tended to be kind of half-hearted and not very energetic.  Time after time the British leadership (both Howe and Clinton) delayed pursuit of the Americans or else pursued slowly and cautiously.  This allowed the Patriot forces to escape the noose on several critical occasions.  Additionally, lack of unity in the British commend led to some grievous errors, such as Clinton's failure to meet Burgoyne at Saratoga, and instead, go off to capture the Rebel capitol for his own glory.  <br>  <br>  4.  The French, who had a larger military (although an admittedly inferior Navy) became involved, and the supply of weapons and powder was critical, as was, later, the commitment of significant numbers of French troops and a large fleet of the French Navy.  See Yorktown.<br>  <br>  5.  Due to French (and Spanish and Dutch) intervension, the British had to disperse troops and their fleet even further, after 1778, and were fighting at the end of a very long, very tenuous supply line.  The fragility of supply lines and the slow speed of orders from the King hampered the fight.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Overall tougher conditions, the British weren't used to America's land.

And I agree with the ones that he is trying to help don't deserve it. If a family files for bankruptcy, will the government intervene and bail them out? No. So why companies. I say let them close and help others thrive and get the businesses that we have overseas come home and give jobs to Amercians.  I'm f*%@ing sick of seeing "Made in China" on every product I buy.  I would like to call a toll-free number and get a real people that speaks American.<br>  <br>  Obama says he will improve employment ratings. How?  What jobs? New jobs are needed, so let those companies go bankrupt and let others buy them out. And get the overseas businesses back here.

They should not be spending any money at all. Those companies who are weak should go out of business and the companies that are still strong don't need a bailout. Also, with the weaker companies out of the way it will leave an increased amount of demand in the market which will be picked up, hence, increasing profits to the stronger companies and giving them the monetary assets to expand. But, in reality those weak companies are going to be right back in this position in a few years even with the bailout. Those how know how to read the market and make the right choices will ALWAYS come out ahead. If there was a complete distribution of wealth equally among every citizen in the U.S. I am willing to bet that it would end up in the same place it is today. Those who make poor financial decision will always do so. It is never fair to have those who work hard and make sarcifices punished because those around them chose to screw up. It is the same way in dealing with our population. The rich (and most aren't born into it) who studied hard for many years and not to mention took ALL the risk are always paying for those who chose to ruin their credit, party too much, not make investments in education, etc.!|`|akKqmvvjaa	Then It wouldnt be "bailout" money.

After the Nazi-perpetrated Holocaust during World War II, genocide was defined (in part) as a crime "committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such." Does genocide apply to the experience of the indigenous peoples of the New World?<br>  Some scholars believe that it does. Historian David Stannard, for example, has argued that "The destruction of the Indians of the Americas was, far and away, the most massive act of genocide in the history of the world." Stannard believes that the natives of the Americas were deliberately and systematically exterminated over the course of several centuries, and that the process continues to the present day. Stannard estimates that almost 100 million American indigenous people have been killed what he calls the American Holocaust.[16]<br>  Stannard's claim of 100 million deaths has been disputed because he does not cite any demographic data to support this number, and because he makes no distinction between death from violence and death from disease. Noble David Cook considers books such as Stannard's—a number of which were released around the year 1992 to coincide with the 500th anniversary of the Columbus voyage—to be an unproductive return to Black Legend-type explanations for depopulation. In response to Stannard's figure, political scientist R. J. Rummel has instead estimated that over the centuries of European colonization about 2 million to 15 million American indigenous people were the victims of what he calls democide. "Even if these figures are remotely true," writes Rummel, "then this still make this subjugation of the Americas one of the bloodier, centuries long, democides in world history."[17]<br>  While no mainstream historian denies that death and suffering were unjustly inflicted by a number of Europeans upon a great many American natives, many argue that genocide, which is a crime of intent, was not the intent of European colonization. Historian Stafford Poole wrote: "There are other terms to describe what happened in the Western Hemisphere, but genocide is not one of them. It is a good propaganda term in an age where slogans and shouting have replaced reflection and learning, but to use it in this context is to cheapen both the word itself and the appalling experiences of the Jews and Armenians, to mention but two of the major victims of this century."[18]<br>  Therefore, most mainstream scholars tend not to use the term "genocide" to describe the overall depopulation of American natives. However, a number of historians, rather than seeing the whole history of European colonization as one long act of genocide, do cite specific wars and campaigns which were arguably genocidal in intent and effect. Usually included among these are the Pequot War and campaigns waged against tribes in California starting in the 1850s<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_history_of_American_indigenous_peoples#The_genocide_debate" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_...</a><br>  <br>  of course there is the embargo on iraq in the 1990s killed 1500000 iraqi civilians according to UN. america is the major power in the world then and clearly responsible, all atempts to left the sanctions were mainly stoped by the american and there british tail. i didn't mention heroshima and nagazaki. i'm sick of all of this, i don't won't to search any more. you win.|`|ced59d06acef8031c0b8f61b935f1742aa	<a href="http://lexrex.com/enlightened/articles/warisaracket.htm\" rel="nofollow">http://lexrex.com/enlightened/articles/w...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clubhousewreckards.com/plot/plottoseizethewhitehouse.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.clubhousewreckards.com/plot/p...</a>|`|fe55f872a270662c24f8728b8d2b674aaa	Don't know, but we have lost over a million combined in all the wars we've been in.<br>  I can't find the web site now...but Germany holds the record for most killed.

AA11645739	In 2004, most states had a chance to vote for Badnarik/Campagna (Libertarian) (48 states +DC), Peroutka/Baldwin (Constitution) (36 states), Nader/Camejo (Reform) (34 states +DC), or Cobb/LaMarche (Green) (27 states +DC). While they had a chance, they picked up less than 1% of the popular vote (as well as 0 in the electoral college).<br>  <br>  The third parties took a beating last election as in the 2000 election Nader picked up 2.7% of the popular vote. Back in 1992, Perot even got a whooping 18.9%. The have even made a difference before, such as the elections of 1892, 1912, 1924, 1980, as well as the aforementioned '92 and 2000 elections.<br>  <br>  The problem with the popular maxim of 'a third party vote is a wasted vote' is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. When someone realizes this and throws their chips in with a third party, it will draw attention to that party (especially if it is a 'safe state') whereas most people probably never heard of them regardless of whether they were on the ticket.<br>  <br>  I do believe that the third parties will draw more attention soon (perhaps in 2016). The two major parties need to consolidate the perception of their positions. This is not happening, which means a third party will rise and they will fix themselves by the next election or a third party will replace one of the big two (the Republican did this in 1860 with the Whigs).|`|AA10114303	Two reasons.

Most of us have only a capability with our jobs and activities to see two sides to each issue.  Often the chances of another view actually playing a significant part in political change is snuffed out by our attention spans.  Perhaps in the future, maybe 30 or so years down the road, we may be able to advance to an understanding of how to vote candidates on issues a little more.  We live in a society where judging is done on personality rather than issue oft times and the privlidged in this society get to present the ideas.  This also protects us at this point from the autocratic rule that can take place in the world from concentrations of wealth there.

You have to take 50% + 1 vote in order to get the electoral votes in all but two states (Nebraska and I think Maine), so even if a 3rd party candidate had a large enough percentage of votes, he would still have to win the electoral college.<br>  <br>  All of these systems are designed to keep any third party candidate out of the running.

Sa8J4Cr6aa	To serve in the Indian Police Service one has to pass the Civil Services Examination or elevated from the state cadre, which is conducted by the Union Public Service Commission, every year. This examination is a common examination conducted for selection to the other one of the other All India Services, viz. the Indian Administrative Service, as well as various other Group A and Group B services under the Central Government. (The recruitment examination for the third All India Service- the Indian Forest Service- is conducted separately by the UPSC.) This examination consists of three stages.    At stage one, there is an objective type examination called the Preliminary examination. This is a qualifying examination and only the candidates who clears this can appear for the next stage called the Main examination. In the Main examination each candidate has to select two optional subjects, apart from which all candidates have to take a General Studies, Essay and compulsory language exam. The Main examination is a very intensive subjective type examination for which marks are awarded.    A shortlist is prepared on the basis of the Main examination and these candidates can compete in the third and final stage of exam called the Viva voce or the Interview. The marks of the Main examination and the Interview are combined to prepare a final merit list of selected candidates.

Two men walked into the Grand Market, in the 6200 block of South Sixth Avenue, sometime before 5:30 p.m., said Sgt. Mark Robinson, a Tucson Police Department spokesman.   They shot at an employee, a man in his early 50s, who fired back, Robinson said.   The employee shot one of the would-be-robbers, an 18-year-old, who ran outside into the parking lot where he collapsed and died. The other robber ran away, and police are still looking for him, Robinson said.   The employee was also shot. He was taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, Robinson said.   Witnesses described the missing suspect as in his mid-20s to early 30s. He was wearing a black-and-white football jersey and a red bandanna, Robinson said.   Margarita Grajeda lives in the area and drops into the Grand Market from time to time.   Grajeda wasn't surprised that someone could get shot trying to rob the market. She said the store had been robbed before, and it was only a matter of time before someone at the store was forced to shoot.   "I knew somebody was going to get shot someday," she said.   As for the store owners, she said she hoped they were all right.   "They're such nice people. So nice," she said.|`|13fDE4nGaa	Bend over & grab your ankels and do some smuthin or move to the Midwest

We can offer definitions like "Truth is that which conforms to reality, fact, or actuality."  But this basic definition is not complete because its definition is open to interpretation and a wide variety of applications.  What is reality?  What is fact?  What is actuality?

E9XL5x3Paa	For the purpose of your illustration, you said that the trickle of the hose cannot keep up with the hole.    But it can if we repair some of the hole, right?      Well, it appears Obama is planning to do so. He is leaving the Iraq War.     Bush wanted to fight the war, but not raise the funds (taxes) necessary to cover the war. To do it, he borrowed the money from other countries; and then had to borrow more and more when the war wouldn't finish.    He turned the $4 trillion National Debt he inherited into $11 trillion. Such a meteoric rise scared investors into no longer backing the dollar because they didn't believe we could pay back our debt. That sent the dollar's value down.        That means businesses have to pay more dollars to make the same products. Oil is also measured in dollars, so with the dollar losing its value it took more of them to equal the same barrel of oil. That sent oil's price way high, which raised costs of shipping way high as well. That combined with more expensive production costs to send prices through the roof.    To make up for that loss in money, the businesses had to cut expenses. The biggest one they cut was payroll; in other words, they laid off employees.    Well, employees are also consumers. When they lost their jobs at the same time that prices went skyhigh, they had to cut their spending. There's the problem with Middle Class spending.    Fewer sales meant a lower profit line for businesses, which meant more layoffs. There's your problem in the job market.    A lower profit line meant fewer investors. Would you invest in a company barely making a profit? How about one making an out-and-out loss? There's your problem in the Stock Market.    And employees are also bank lendees. Having lost their jobs and their savings (401k lost to stock market as well as investments), they started defaulting on their home loans, mortgages, and car loans. There's your problems in the financial sector, the subprime mortgages, the real estate market, and the auto industry.        If we leave the Iraq War, we stop incurring that expense. That reignites investors want to back the dollar and it recovers. That means the businesses can afford to make products again, and need someone to make those products. Jobs come back, and that means more customers.    More customers means a higher profit line because of sales, which means more investment into business from investors. The whole system is restarted.        You're right that we have to get to a place where demand and supply meet, and demand is too low. But if we keep the system afloat with the stimulus, while at the same time getting more money to the customers through jobs, they will meet at a higher point even if the trickle in is not as big as you think necessary.    Rather than put water in and try to save it, Obama only puts enough to keep the system alive. But he raises the customer's abilty to demand products. He's coming at it from the opposite angle you are, but reaching the same goal.|`|FdQD8H3qaa	you seem to have answered your own question in the question but the fact is that yes the stimulus won't fix the hole it will just try to keep adding water to the top of the bucket at the same rate as it is leaking out the bottom...  It isn't even a patch job... the thing is that it's not so much that there's a whole in the bucket it's that the bucket is shrinking so the water is spilling out every which way.  The 14 trillion bucket was to big and has to be brought back down to a manageable size.  True people have to spend more so that the demand and supply are equal but the thing is that people need to reign in their excessive spending and start saving... right now people are trying to save as much as they can and spend as little as possible. so it's not so good right now but once people feel safe and secure with what they have saved they will start spending again its just that they need to find the balance between being  frugal and being wasteful.|`|85be78e04e9f820a7ce075e3e85248e8aa	wow that was a lot of reading hmm this stimulus plan is bull that's all i have to say|`|Oj5oZYJ4aa	I think the big question here is how to efficiently fix the hole instead of trying to ignore it by adding more water.  If your water got turned off or it's a slow trickle wouldnt you have to find a way to fix the hole quickly without waisting so much water?  but how?|`|cRDbeUDvaa	Not a bad analogy.  And from 1929 to 1932, we did indeed have a 45% contraction in GDP.  But since 1938, we have had only two years that the nominal GDP (not inflation adjusted) has contracted at all (1945-46, 1948-49), and both very slightly.  Yes, real (inflation-adjusted) GDP has contracted by a small amount a few times since 1938, but the worst post-war contraction in real GDP (1981-82) was less than 2%, Even then, nominal GDP grew. Macroecomics is sophisticated enough now that we know how to keep that hole to only a few percent.  Even if the contraction is an unprecedented post-depression amout of 5%, the stimulus makes up the difference.  So the stimulus, along with all the actions of the Federal Reserve, will work fine.  Predictions of financial armageddon are huge exaggerations.|`|3FtC9D40aa	Ahh. But isn't taxation effectively another hole in the bucket.     And the hose will never stop.

First have him/her count out all the monies in the piggy bank - another leaning experience. Next, go to the hardware store. Depending on what he can afford, it seems like the choice is between buying something to patch up the bucket with, or getting a new bucket. Personally, I'd go for the new bucket. Luck.
026b1934d4ff58e232cc4b419808adc4aa	I think the Republicans are making a gamble. Remember where the Republican party is. They have lost the House, Senate, and the Presidency. They have nothing left to lose. They also know that no matter what Obama does, he cannot fight market forces. He can maybe soften the blow of our horrible economy, but that is about it. The market will have to correct itself.    With that being said, the Republicans have nothing left to lose. They knew it would pass without them. The one thing Republicans do much better than Democrats is that they stick together. They figured that if they didn't vote for the stimulus, they would have tremendous ammo if the economy doesn't turn around quickly, which it won't.

How are we wrong for opposing billions of dollars in pointless government spending that will do nothing to help our economy? Why is this wrong? Why do we need to spend 25,000,000 of taxpayers money to make ATV trails, when the 99 percent of america wont even use them? Why should we have to pay 335,000,000 for STD prevention when we arent sleepin around? Its a corrupt bill, and republicans are smart enough to know this. It will do nothing to stimulate the economy. And if you "hear" it worked, your listening to the Mainstream media too much, and there brainwashing you from reality. Get a grip people.|`|9b4c3cf261f87e8eff03139562cebd19aa	they did not vote for it because it did not work for Bush and will not work for Obama this administration should listen to the nobel prize winning economist instead of going for more money|`|f7EC1HESaa	This plan will cause inflation, the treasury has to print more money. you cant just pull money out of no where. this theoretically might help jobs but the dollar will drastically decrease in value. not to mention we already had a bailout plan the the republicans did vote for last year and it still hasnt worked. do you remember the stimulus checks that we all got, those did not help. its not that we republicans don't care about the poor we are just no to sure spending more money will help. During the Jackson administration he eliminated the national bank, this caused banks to print more money than they had causing massive inflation and a huge depression in the early 1840's. German did the same thing, they printed more money than they had after the young and dawes plan and things got even worse. it might work but there is a greater chance that it will not and we republicans dont want to waste 800 billion dollars on something that has a small chance of working. instead we should probably cut taxes for all classes to stimulate growth in the economy. more rich people with more money means more jobs for the lower class.

fQgbBx7caa	OMG.  This is the thing that pisses me off.  When I see on the news some of these large stores opening up creating jobs,  it furiates me.  How in the hell does anyone even if you are married can live on minimum wage?  So what if they created jobs, one damned pay check goes to rent, its a crock of ****.  I have asked on this site how in the hell does anyone make it on the crumbs these companies pay, and no benefits whats the incentive?  All these jobs do is give teens some play money, pay for gas and insurance to get them back to that low paying job.  The immigrants gets more than that an hour.|`|rDMDRRihaa	because 7.00 an hour beats 0 dollars an hour and with this economy you should take what you get|`|OLhAsgLmaa	well, maybe you like that type of work...|`|IWlPfk1raa	This is a problem caused by illegal immigration.

Well on the assumption, many people agree with you. You can get paid a lot of money on social security money so why work right? It makes no sense if you ask me. They should either;  A. Get rid of social security money so more people have to work.  B. Make minimum wage higher.

But, I did as a single mom with a baby so I don't accept excuses.  It is baffling, is it not? usually, a man gets most of his pride from the work he completes. If you are going to be staying home, most likely drinking and smoking, then getting depressed, getting your free rides to the doctor that L & I provides, then L & I or SSI will then tell you that you have to see one of their doctors, etc....Get the picture?

You could get two jobs if you needed to, and I also think that if you stuck with a job and did it well you could move up, even if it's a freaking fast food restaurant.    Do you not want to better yourself?? Are you really and truly happy and okay with living off the government without any plans to ever having anything better in life than what you currently?      As for your comment about learning disabilities and not doing well at school, go to trade school. You could be a beautician, or whatever else tech schools offer. You don't have to be the brightest bulb to graduate from one of those.

I am in a situation now where I can take the route you have taken. I am praying everyday for a work at home job though. My last job was cleaning for a hospital & the people I worked with were so nasty. I was treated like a slave & I really did work hard & do good things for the hospital. I risked getting MRSA & really messed up my hip, shoulder & feet running around so much. I couldn't have a snack in the afternoon & once almost feel on the floor from low blood sugar. The nurse who took by blood test told me I better watch it cause when people fall it is not gentle. I don't know how I could do anything cause I was not allowed to take a break in the afternoon & constantly berated about not getting more done. So I quit a year ago to take care of my health first. So I don't want these problems again where I am riding around with low blood sugar which is like being drunk. I have borrowed money to survive so I need a big income to  pay my bills. I understand why you are doing what you are doing. I am the type of person who will end up freezing to death with the poor circulation from diabetes, if I don't have more money to borrow or a job. So I am happy for a person like you that can survive. I was raised to be a martyr like the 93 year old man who froze to death the other day...I have no explaination for anyone to make $7 an hour cause if they need transportation to get to the job they will end up in debt so they can work.|`|CdTe8MO4aa	you sound ungreatful|`|FZRWMc3Baa	The American Dream.

Keep in mind, almost everything in the Air Force is computer and technically driven, which is the way of the future.
VjFCNozjaa	The guy that answered above is correct but I wanted to add a few things:    Don't count on your family being able to move right after you graduate A school - it can take a while to make arrangements (you will start on that when you arrive at your new duty station) and they shouldn't count the date as definite as far as graduation from Basic and A School goes because injury, not having enough people to fill a class, and other things out of your control could change when you finish Basic and A School.    There is also the matter of availability of space at your new duty station in base housing. I know it's tough but you're going to have to be a bit patient this first few months. The motto in the military is "Hurry up and wait."    Make sure your wife has your recruiters number in case she needs help. Also make sure you leave her a copy of any contact info provided in the initial paperwork they send you and a copy of your orders to go to basic - she may need it to prove that you are where you are and conduct business for your family while you are gone.    Make sure you leave her a list of account numbers, passwords, and get the bills and things you may handle normally organized and in a folder for her so she has an easier time handling things while you are gone.     Email me if you need any help.|`|0BoDF6iBaa	In Boot camp and A school(assuming it's less than 6 months) you'll get BAH based off the zip code that your wife and kid are living in.  When you get orders to a permanent station, you'll be funded to move your family to that area and receive BAH based off that zip code.    EDIT: Oh and no, they won't move them to boot camp area, nor the A school area.  You'll finish those first and then your family can move with you when you get permanent orders.|`|XzStbSPnaa	Yes, but you won't actually get it in your bank account for about 45 days|`|9tcv3TiWaa	Boot camp is not accompanied you will not see your wife/child until you have completed it.  BAH then will be based on her zip code at the time you left.   A school if less than 26 weeks in 1 location then it will not be accompanied and while there it will be based on her location at the time you left.  If it is over 26 weeks and approved then the Military will hire movers to come and get your things, move them to where you are going to, you qualify for housing, etc.... If you didn't get to be together at A School then it will be at the orders you are issued and you are reporting to your first command.   Then the Military will hire movers to come and move your household, your spouse will get MALT (mileage of $.24 per mile) and Per Diem to get there.   You qualify for BAH based on that zip code or military housing.  Sometimes the wait list for military housing can be awhile.    While you are in Boot Camp your pay will be deposited into the account you wish.  It is on the 15th and 1st of each month.  The BAH will be divided between the two paydays and added to the Basic Pay.  First pay can take up to 6 weeks to be received, it will be backdated.  You will also qualify for Family Separation of $250 per month when gone longer than 30 days on orders.   First pay can be less as you have a lot of deductions coming out of it, like Federal & State Income Tax, Social Security, Medicare, SGLI, FSGLI, Gi Bill, Advance Pay....|`|AA10709853	BAH will be based on your Home of Record( NOT necessarily were she chooses to live) while you are in Boot and A school.   it will be based on your duty station after that.     they cannot move to Chicago.   they won't see you for 9 weeks anyway, as you are not allowed visitors and phone calls must be earned.   if A school is under 6 months long they cannot move to that location unless they choose to do so on your dime.  YOU will not be permitted to live with them.      Only accompanied PCS orders rate a paid Household Goods Move.  and yes, there are places you can be sent that family members are not permitted.. E4 and below do NOT get accompanied orders OCONUS( to include HI and AK) and certain other locations such as Diego Garcia, and in your case, Bahrain( no children, only spouses may go) , no family members are permitted|`|gDSJpRvTaa	Best take in to account that you will  assigned to a Unit that is about to be  Deployed right after "A" School...    Base Housing is assigned on a First Come,  First Served Basis...some wait lists are  up to a year long.    Rule of thumb...  The further away from the Base you get  the Cheaper and Better the Housing...  Just because there are a lot of Service  people living in a Complex, does not  mean it is good...    Been there, Done That...
a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	Slavery is alive and well in the US. A clear 1/4th of the worlds prisoners are here in the US and they all work for 25 cents an hour or less for industries who make huge profits from for profit prisons.  It would be all good and well if even half of the inmates were there for real crimes, but drug possession, especially marijuana is hardly a crime against humanity or even society and that makes up nearly 3/4ths of all  US prison inmates.  We were clearly all lied to and lead to believe there was no way we could afford to keep people in our jails so privatization came into being while new "tough on crime" laws were passed and everyone who was "guilty of smoking pot" was slapped into the system called criminal "JUST US". I've never profited one nickel from for profit prisons and i seriously doubt any of you have either unless employed as a guard in one. And those guards, by the way have unions.. They sure as hell do and they ALL vote republican and donate heavily to them because they support "tough on crime" schemes. But the rest of us aren't supposed to have unions. They allegedly rob us all blind even though they never did before prison privatization of the 80's and 90's when the pukes controlled congress and the white house..  Slavery is alive and well in America and now perfectly legal. BIG corporations use prison labor every single day and that's where the jobs are disappearing as well as a communist nation Reagan pretended to hate so much.  You want job security in America? Go to prison. They'll make sure you have a job for life....as a slave.|`|IM30PoPNaa	No. We're not.|`|rUNlmQG5aa	It is less back peddling as keeping up with the illusion of solvency.

Most Americans still believe that there should be a minimum wage law and that it should be raised periodically. That means that MOST of us are not backpedaling toward "slavery." You apparently want for 100% of the people to all support the minimum wage law and the increases of it, because if even so much as one person disagrees with the majority, then "we" are doing something wrong. Not very tolerant of diverse views, are you?    For myself, I also oppose the minimum wage law, but I express my reasons why I oppose the law better than the person whom you quote. I have also resigned myself that I am and have been for a very long time outnumbered on my view. I still believe that the minimum wage law is economically foolish and that for an employer to pay an employee less than the government's mandated minimum is not at all "slavery." But I'm outvoted and it may be the case that I always will be.|`|ScZPVCUpaa	People like that abound in Y!A.  The current financial meltdown shows that when the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, a huge void is created.    We pay our employees a living wage which is almost twice the minimum wage.  Our profits may be less, but having pride and integrity more than makes up for that.
64SObnr5aa	The answer to your question is this:    Stop the insane profits    Stop the insurance industry which is the single biggest contributor to our medical costs --- after all, it's only money and $10 for an aspirin is nothing, just as long as they continue to hit their bottom line of profit, on top of more profit, on top of more and more and more.    ============    I had a nasty fall in China, ended up in the hospital.  Multiple CAT scans, ex rays, treatments and visits and the whole bill came to $130.    I estimated that the total cost in the USA would be $1,300 based on cost of living adjustment.  I believe, in reality, it would have been $10,000 or more based on my past experiences.     I'm certainly not saying that the China system is better, but our system is nowhere near $8,700 better.    ============    I would welcome nationalized health care in the USA, if they do it smart.  Smart to me means going to every country that has such care, then taking the best of all worlds and building a health system based on that will be the envy of the world.    We can do that. Not only do we owe that to our people, but we also owe it to our pride.  We have very little social pride in America, what we have is nationalism pride which has a nasty habit of turning the ones we are trying to help against us.    Peace  Jim    .|`|VxTYl48Caa	The current bill they are proposing for National health care will run current providers out of business and they know it!  They have provisions to employ some who loose their job and the remainder get an extended unemployment package.  Plus it will provide worse health care and save no money.  We saw how the government programs work (Social Security)  The fools are on the loose.|`|u9g2Cl6Eaa	Yes, costs are going up and the ability of people to pay is getting worse.    FACT - the USA spends more on healthcare PER PERSON than any other nation on the planet.      FACT - the US has higher death rates for kids aged under five than western European countries with universal health coverage.    That means that a dead American four year old would have had a better chance of life if they were born in Canada, France, Cuba, Germany, Japan etc, all of which have universal health coverage.|`|c88d6a4b2e8a26ac9bd239980605f6f8aa	Our leaders?

wg78UkxFaa	Because they are in prison!  Inmates are not sent to prison so that they can have fun by playing video games.  It is meant to be a punishment, a place where they are sent to reflect on what they have done wrong in an to society.  So that hopefully they will change their ways and become a better and a productive person who does the right things.    Answer to  2 Question.    No its not a good idea.  Why would any one want to reward people who murder, rape, rob or commit any other crimes against society.  They are in prison for a reason, its a punishment and its not suppose to be a fun time for them.    I hope this helps answer your question.

It's like they come out of jail with a degree in what to do next and how to do it better..|`|m3q6CIQMaa	I dont hear of very many prisoners playing video games.  Whether an inmate can have something in his jail cell is going to be up to the correctional facility where they are.  Most jails wont allow them to have anything but the necessities because almost anything is good enough to be considered as a weapon.    They should not be allowed to have fun.  They are in prison for a reason.  They are there to serve time.  Not play games.|`|XYTUAzzgaa	because then nerds would flood into the prisons|`|zokJMPBAaa	when you in there for life or facing the death row both cases you going to die in prison it should be allowed no different than giving millions of dollars to these failing businesses and what they do with the money  excuse me taxpayers dollars?|`|cO186jeaaa	because its PRISON, it aint not resort and it aint supposed to be fun. its intended as punishment for crimes commited!

I was disapointed. The tiers in our western Society were still there. The millionaire class were represented by the Party Leaders. the middle classes with all the fancy clothes and the smart motors were repesented by the Secret Police who really were not very secret etc. etc.  I realised that Communism is based on a totally false premise.  It is based on the assumption the Humankind are basically altruistic. That we all want to look out for each other and work tegether for the common good of mankind. Whereas we all know that it`s every man for himself out there.  Were it not for this basic flaw I would plump for communism every time.  At least Global capitalism is honest in its representation of itself as a grasping dog eat dog society.  There is no way out in this life I fear. Just do your best, turn to God and expect the next life to be better.
3yXhtBSxaa	Yes.  Nearly every picture we see of that poor man makes him look like a drooling doofus.  I think they took those pictures on purpose, when he's in the middle of saying a word to perpetuate the "idiot" tag so many people have placed on him.    I am NOT his biggest fan.  I criticized his policies often.  However, I don't think he's an idiot.  Many people don't realize he suffers from dyslexia, which naturally makes giving speeches difficult.  That, paired with the fact the liberal media HATED that Gore and Kerry lost the elections, put him in a much worse light than he should have been in.  He obviously wasn't the best President we've had, and he's made a lot of decisions I don't agree with, but I have seen worse, much worse.    EDIT:  Joe...seriously? That is what you SERIOUSLY believe?  ROFLMAO!|`|c654465d22c58a2c5b0af285003b2789aa	Absolutely! It's disgusting!|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	Not all of it, but the media certainly did the man no favors whatsoever.|`|k1W70RHFaa	Er, not really.    The media doesn't distort any facts. It simply reports.

How did those look like?|`|2pWMhDcEaa	No, pretty much Bush generated.|`|QTQTdPO1aa	Yes it was.  People didn't like that fact that he did what he said he was going to do.  People don't know how to handle that, because so many in the public eye flip flop.|`|2fn7tbrxaa	Because the media primarily leans left of center politically, and uses its influence to propel their agenda, which includes bashing Republicans. Bush was a prime target not only because he looked a fool often, but because his actions as President were in defiance to the left's positions. By taking him down, they assured themselves a good chance at having their nominee win the election.|`|DX9ImmRHaa	Yes.  They damned John McCain too.|`|64SObnr5aa	It was 95% Bush generated.    Yes, there is editorializing done in the news, like having a stupid expression on a politicians face when they do something stupid, to having the brash leadership one when they do something patriotic.    I think that is wrong for the press to do that.  Editorializing needs to be on the editorial pages, not the news pages.    In Bush's case, he made his own bed.

LOL|`|89BVfrHyaa	When you go to basic training, you do all of your Army in processing at reception battalion, which will include a full dental exam. At that point they will determine your dental classification and if your wisdom teeth will need to be removed before you graduate basic and AIT or not.    I've been in for a few years now, and I still have all 4 of my wisdom teeth. They're comming in straight, and aren't causing any discomfort at all. However, they still are going to get removed eventually. At some point when doing my yearly dental exam the dentist is going to order me to get them yanked.|`|UoAZLRG8aa	Maybe. They pulled my finger.|`|021dCKpDaa	yes, if u are in the military, your wisdom teeth will eventually get taken out.|`|3efddv41aa	Yep.. most likely! I had mine taken out while I was in the military!|`|00d786944e606b597135130a50ce9affaa	Yup they will, when my dad was in the Marines he had to have his pulled. All branches have the same medical qualifications. Luckily I already got mine pulled lol.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Maybe, maybe not.    They will ask you to schedule an appointment to take them out, every time you go to the dentist.    But they will only order you to have them taken out,     If they start impacting other teeth or your health.    IE: if they start growing sideways into your back molars.    That's what happened to me, for 3.5 years they ask me to get em out,     Then an x-ray showed they were touching my back molars,    And I was ordered to have them taken out.    It is not a big deal, an oral surgon will do it,     I had no pain at all.

S3ktbzDNaa	The second one is correct.    The first one describes the niece or nephew of an aunt or uncle through marriage. Since the niece or nephew of your aunt or uncle not through marriage is your first cousin, I would say this relationship would be called a first cousin through marriage.    Here's the way orders of cousins work:  If you share a set of parents, you are siblings  If you share a set of grandparent, you are first cousins  If you share a set of great grand parent, you are second cousins  If you share a set of great great grand parent, you are third cousins and so on.    For removed cousins (from different generation), count up from the younger generation until you get one of these relationships. The number you get is the number of times removed that relationship is.    For example, my second cousin's grand children are my second cousins twice removed. If you count up two generations from them, you get a second cousin relationship with me. Hence two generations removed from second cousins, or second cousins twice removed.|`|HP9eT8eLaa	I understand the second cousins thing, but what would I call my first cousin's child in relation to me?  Is that where that "once removed" thing comes into play?|`|QQsIPlV2aa	The second one is correct - once-removed means exactly that - once removed from the first cousin!!!|`|70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	I thought we had this settled...lol.    Children of first cousins are second cousins to each other, and yes, they share a bloodline.    http://www.sonic.net/~fredd/cousins.html    Edit for Alexis....when starting with YOU, children of your first cousins are your first cousins, once removed. Check out the link, it gets confusing after this.    Explaining the, "once removed," can confuse people even more but here goes. The, "removed," part has to do with the difference in generations. I'll explain first cousin once removed this way:    The first cousin of your mother or father is your first cousin once removed. You are two generations younger than your grandparents, and your mother or father is one generation younger than your grandparents. Two generations minus one equals one, thereby....once removed.

First USA should give Pakistan the proper and latest equipment to seal its border with Afghanistan then criticize Pakistan, I wonder how Americans can only blame Pakistan for Taliban attacks? Since all 35 NATO nations are in Afghanistan with their latest equipments USA itself is there with the number one technology in the whole world, Afghanistan should care about its borders but yet the whole world and specially USA blame only only only PAKISTAN.  We all know that USA can't secure its easy border with Mexico with its world number one technology but they expect Pakistan to secure its Mountainous border with Afghanistan, i just wonder on the hypocrisy of Americans.  Securing Pakistan Afghanistan border is a joint joint joint responsibility of all NATO and specially AMERICA & Afghanistan & then PAKISTAN.  And Pakistan has lost more troops & civilians than USA or any other country for this so called war on terror.  USA and WEST first look at their deeds then point out their fingers on Pakistan, USA must must must give Pakistan the latest spying equipments otherwise they should not expect something from Pakistan which is not possible even from them.

This country was built on the ideas of small government and not interfering in the goings on other countries. Unfortunately, the US no longer follows its own Constitution and is turning more and more into a super power police-state, trying to take on the problems of the world and put a band-aid over them. We should not be policing the world, we shouldn't be involved in other country's business. However, to this date we have soldiers stationed in more than 180 other countries - and that is where part of our tax dollars go. The other part, to line the pockets of the 1% wealthy that couldn't care less if we live or die.    Hoo-ray, America.|`|oIdQaEAUaa	Err - for your information your government has signed up to a United Nations agreement on aid. In 1970 the developed nations agreed to provide 0.7 percent of GDP in aid to developing countries. This promise has never been fulfilled. USAs aid, in terms of percentage of their GNP has almost always been lower than any other industrialized nation in the world, though paradoxically since 2000, their dollar amount has been the highest. Only since 2004 have they moved up from last place, by just one or two places. The US provides more aid to Israel than the rest of the world put together! Aid is primarily designed to serve the strategic and economic interests of the donor countries. Pakistan is on the verge of bankruptcy - and America wants it to fight it's "war on terror" Pakistan can't do this on its own. The Americans have never cow towed to Pakistan - in fact its absolutely the other way around and it's one of the factors which is causing some of the problems faced by the country.

They will then be the burdens on the taxpayer as they will find it difficult to get jobs, rely on benefits and this may carry on through the generations.

The problem is yet again irresponsible parenting - if they want their children to fit into their adopted country they should make an effort to teach them basic English at least so they start school with the same advantages as everyone else and dont have to spend the first year or so being taught English.    Unfortunately we are between a rock and a hard place - part of me thinks tough let them get on with it and if their parents cant be bothered why should I pay to educate them - but as you say if we dont educate them then we are storing up problems and an increase in welfare in the future.

We risk returning to life as cave-dwellers if this ridiculous trend continues.    On the one hand we have text speak which is taking over from standard spelling, and on the other there is an inability to spell words like 'lose' which is often spelt as loose. There is an inability to differentiate between to, two and too, but that is all right as we can just use 2 for each of them. Many cannot differentiate between there, their and they're, so they just use there for everything. Again, 'you're' and 'your' have become 'your'. Whilst I agree that it's terrible that many immigrant children cannot speak English, I am far more angered and ashamed by the fact that many children who were born in the UK are not much better.

93AgePoZaa	I dont know how much of the news you hear but my husband said that the goverment is paying a couple billion dollars to help out the car manufacterers because noone can buy new vehicles. he figured it out and if they would give that money to us citizens 18+ that would give everyone $100,000 so I see what your saying they should just give more of a stimulus check this year and get the economy back on its feet. the stimulus that got passed today doesnt help everyone. only the rich. because they get tax breaks what about everyone who doesnt make that much money and they dont need to pay they are gettin screwed!|`|8704d6bf53d5099969addcfa560ad9eaaa	With all the bail out and Obama trillion dollar stimu-Obama package there was enough to give every taxpayer $100,000 each with money left over, even if everyone paid off all their bills with in one month everyone will be back in debt and the economy would be booming once again.  But all that money was not to help anything but the greedy and Obama apparently is the greediest of them all.  Obama criticized Bush administration for the National Debt and with in Obama second week has added almost ONE TRILLION DOLLARS to the debt, and just about everyone claims it will not do any good Obama experience kicking in I guess he knows better that those that been around the Hill for twenty plus years to Obama 18 months Oooohhhhh!    2009 has just begone and already we are in the hole nearly one trillion dollars and the only thing YES OBAMA BOTS the only thing the taxpayer is getting is the bill in the form of higher taxes and a bigger government which means more higher taxes.

Giving everyone all the money at once will be inflationary and will then lead to stagnation when that money is spent up. That is why only about 25% of the stimulus plan is being spent this year.  2. Public works allows for investment in the infrastructure of this country that will have long term supply side benefits as well as short term demand side kick  3. Targeting recipients allows us to put money where the largest propensity to spend and the lowest propensity to import is.

The top ten percent of taxpayers pay about 70 percent of all taxes.  The bottom fifty percent of ALL taxpayers only chip in less than 3 percent of federal income tax.  This means half of us get a free ride.  4 out of ten pay no income tax at all.   Any government money given out comes from the hard work of the few that are financially successful in this country.  We are not just a few billion in debt, if you add  social security and medicare etc we owe over 60 billion and it grows by the hundreds every second.  Our grandchildren are paying for all of this greed we are displaying.  The ticking time bomb that will eventually ruin our lifestyle is our debt, added to by the minute by a new desire to increase government spending.  All of it is irresponsible and desiring money from the fed is turning us all into leaches.  The problem is it feels so good to get.  Like feeding school children breakfast, it appears to be kind but in the real world this kind of thing is a black, demeaning idea that makes us more dependent which means the more the fed does for us the less freedom we have.  Government spending has NEVER EVER in all of history EVER helped the economy.  Spending government money is a simple minded solution for a looming problem that sooner or later must be addressed by adults.|`|c88d6a4b2e8a26ac9bd239980605f6f8aa	Why not just give everyone $20k?

I also had a written contractual agreement with the IRS to pay xxx amount of dollars each month until my deficiency was paid. When my husband and I filed our taxes last year, we were sent a letter than stated our "stimulus check" would not be forthcoming because of money owed.     Now, tell me--how did our $1500 "stimulate" the economy?     I have no confidence in Barack Obama's "stimulus "plan, or in any "stimulus" plan formulated via state or Federal government.

The problem the government has when they give out money is that everyone puts it in the bank, where it does no economic good.    Our class suggested giving out gift cards to a lot of people. We saw no flaw in that either. Dunno, either the government is comprised of idiots (I don't think it is.) or there are too many laws restricting how the government can HELP people.     "The best government is one that governs not at all." - Henry David Thoreau, I interpret this as "The government should help but not govern, govern taken as control, The government should help the populous without controlling their lives."|`|82xr8sM5aa	Give every person, regardless of age, $1,000,000.  It will cost less than 10% of the 800+Billion the feds. are wanting to spend total and less than what it plans to spend in the first year of the stimulus plan, so it is economically feasible.  Here's how it works:  The upper class will invest the money, this will help publicly held companies by increasing cash-flow. This will also help all the brokerage houses and all involved in the investment industry.  The middle class will use the money to pay off debts. This will help the ailing mortgage industry by increasing their cash-flow. After debts are paid, people would spend. New cars, home repair/additions etc. The auto industry would get a nice pick up when people started buying cars again and the construction industry would boom as well. Then there's retail spending. Big ticket items, vacations, etc. All these industries would boom.  And obviously poor and homeless would benefit as well. The poorest would be forced to have a savings account as most currency exchanges wouldn't be able to cash a check that big. This would help inform many about the benefits of saving money and starting investing. Poor families would be able to save for college and pay for medical expenses. Struggling mothers would be able to work less and afford better child care, or be able to stay home until their children were of school age. Renters would finally have a chance to buy. Again more help to the home market. Yes there will be those who blow the money in a matter of minutes on expensive toys and such, but they'd do that with $100 so who cares?  Communities as a whole would benefit because of increased property taxes due to new homes built and sales tax increases. This means better schools and so on.     Many of you are right when you say that $5000 won't do anything. But $1,000,000 will. It's so much money that the average person would have to do more than just pay off a bill or two. I haven't even began to touch on what it would do for small and micro businesses or those wanting to start one. Obama talked about "wealth redistribution", well this is his opportunity to do so.

jgRRsG8Daa	I can well understand your disgust with the establishment in general and in particular the bestowal of R-Day honors on citizens.While a majority of those honored do merit them,there are also a few who   squeak in through chicanery on the part of their benefactors who   mostly appreciate two basic things.Money and sycophancy.And the   persons who recommend names for the awards can be equated to the class of civil servants in Britain.I am sure you are wondering what the connection is.It is generally said of civil servants in Britain that they do   not know their rears from their elbows.Now you know.Anyway, just  don't let such trivialities get the better of you and push up your BP.Not  worth it.Now,you take an issue like the case of Ms.Bohra and her  children being denied access to the Rashtrapati Bhavan to receive the  Ashok Chakra award bestowed on her husband posthumously.That is something worth feeling not only sad but outraged about too.A real   horrible affair for which the whole nation should hang its head in shame  don't you agree?Have a Nice Day.

Just discovered the top 10 percent own 70 percent of the wealth but pay 40 percent of the taxes! And they still want more tax cuts! Does Rush just simply pick and choose his facts? Or maybe he distorts only certain ones using the power of distraction.    Things Limbaugh supports for you:    You pick up a disproportionate share of America's tax bill. You pay higher prices for a broad range of products from peanuts to prescriptions. You pay taxes that others in a similar situation have been excused from paying. You're compelled to abide by laws while others are granted immunity from them. You must pay debts that you incur while others do not. You're barred from writing off on your tax returns some of the money spent on necessities while others deduct the cost of their entertainment. You must run your business by one set of rules, while the government creates another set for your competitors. In contrast, the fortunate few who contribute to the right politicians and hire the right lobbyists enjoy all the benefits of their special status. Make a bad business deal; the government bails them out. If they want to hire workers at below market wages, the government provides the means to do so. If they want more time to pay their debts, the government gives them an extension. If they want immunity from certain laws, the government gives it. If they want to ignore rules their competition must comply with, the government gives its approval. If they want to kill legislation that is intended for the public, it gets killed.    The stimulus bill was designed by Paul Volcker, REAGAN's leading treasury guy. That's right. The same guy that made Reagan's economic policies so popular by fixing the economy back then, is now the guy in charge of the new economics department Obama setup.  How did Rush miss this fact? Rush's war against Obama also includes making sure his audience gets their sole source of facts from Rush and maybe Hannity on FOX.    Oh that's right, because that damn 40 percent!!!    And no corporation can do any wrong!! Nope!! Unless it's support liberal policies! Conservatives were against civil rights, women's voting, freedmen, social security, the highway project, the peace corps. Because IT WASNT PROFITABLE.

h6c0qGwaaa	Morning, I have never heard of the John and Ken show, it might be that because I am in the upper Midwest by their website numbers it seems that their listeners come from both side of the issues but listeners from both side can usually be said of most talk shows.  Well it should not have to be said but since I have never heard of the show, I have never had reason to email them either. Good luck though with getting a reply as I have ask questions of other radio shows and waited as long as 45 days (the longest) to get a reply.     Joel W, I tried the link you gave and it seems the station the poster asks about and the one you referenced are two different ones. I tried searching on yours for the John and Ken show but go no matching hits.  http://www.hometownstation.com/index.php...  I might not be using the correct string phrase in the search but as it stands using the words, "August Welfare Costs" results in one hit of a "(News/Local News)" which makes me believe "August Welfare Costs For LA County Released " is a carried article on that stations news list only.  http://www.hometownstation.com/index.php...  As for the John and Ken Show I will listen a few times via the "Listen Live" link on their web site.  http://www.kfiam640.com/pages/johnandken...  http://www.kfiam640.com/main.html  I do want to point out however I noticed that they are affiliates of The Rush Limbaugh Show which makes me a tad queasy about the some of the possible views..

That volum of email tells the producers of the show they are being listened to by a huge number of people so the email is not wasted.      One item they are discussing, by the way, is this:  ======================================...  August Welfare Costs For LA County Released        Friday, 26 September 2008    Supervisor Antonovich breaks down the numbers.  http://www.hometownstation.com/local-new...    New statistics from the Department of Public Social Services reveal that illegal aliens and their families in Los Angeles County collected nearly $37 million in welfare and food stamp allocations, announced Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich.     In August, illegals collected over $19 million in welfare assistance and over $17 million in monthly food stamp allocations, for a projected annual cost of $432 million.  Nearly twenty five percent of all welfare and food stamps benefits is going directly to the children of illegal aliens.     Illegal immigration continues to have a devastating impact on Los Angeles County taxpayers, said Antonovich.   Annually, the cost of illegal immigration to Los Angeles County taxpayers exceeds one billion dollars, which includes $220 million for public safety, $400 million for healthcare, and $432 million in welfare allocations.  This does not include millions of dollars for education.|`|AA10487501	i will try and let u know

But it began with Reagan while the Democrats slept in the late 70s. They saw an opening and seized it then went rampant with deregulation so the new robber barons of the world could once again rule over us all.  Military might in Iraq was step one with weapons, then there is also the genocide sanctioned in SriLanka against the Tamil's but hidden well by labeling all Tamil's as terrorists when in fact they have been civilians for centuries.

Then it occurred to me, that I did not own my home (the bank did, but that is a whole other issue) but rather the government did because if I did not pay the taxes the bank would force me to, or if I owned the home outright, the government would take it away, along with all the improvements.  In affect, I never really owned the home, I was only renting it.    It took me a decade to finally get out from under my massive debt and I have not borrowed a dime in the last 20 years.    The American dream is smoke and mirrors and the sooner the people wake up to that is the sooner the people will take it back.    Being debt free is the most freedom I have ever enjoyed.  I am free to travel, change jobs at will, and even pick up and move to another country.    Freedom is not always measured by politics, I hold freedom from debt higher and political freedom second. Being in debt always means slavery, lack of political freedom does not always mean that.    Peace  Jim    .

E9XL5x3Paa	In fairness lonewolf, you could say the same about Christianity.      And as a rule, anyone who hates Islam does so because they don't know what Islam is.  In fact, they are an extension of Christianity, and even believe in Jesus.        Judaism begins the process when they have the story of man's fall from God's grace by eating the forbidden fruit.  God tells them they must leave the Garden of Eden, but that he will one day provide a way for them to re-attain salvation and come back.    Then we travel through the years, with various prophets and judges and kings to tell the Israelites (and eventually us) about how God will back those who follow Him.  Many proofs of this are given throughout that time period by God.    Judaism believes the Savior has not come yet.          This is where Christianity takes over.  They do believe the Savior has come, in the form of Jesus.  Jesus comes and tells us about God's plan, how He has come to fulfill the prophecy of the Savior, what to expect after his death and at the end, and how to prepare for it.       This is where Islam takes over.  They also believe in Jesus and that He was sent by God.  But they believe words that Jesus said have since been misused.  And it is hard to argue with that, considering the evil that has been wrought with Bible backing; despite the fact that Jesus was very peaceful and preached peace and love for fellow man.    So Islam believes that God sent another prophet, not to replace Jesus, not to counter Jesus, not to clarify Jesus, but simply to repeat and restore what Jesus had said.  And then to provide certain things, like 5 prayers a day, to keep us constantly thinking on the words of all the prophets so that no one could ever twist or misuse their words again.  We would know the words and would not let them do that.    That prophet was Mohammed, and he also taught peace.        Both Christianity and Islam are religions of peace.  Their "followers" have not always been followers of peace; but the religions themselves both preach peace and togetherness.

hJNwAHccaa	After he completes AIT and is assigned to his new unit, there is certain additional training and preparation that he must go though before heading out to deployment.  There are many deployment briefings and theater specific training that he must attend.  He must also go through weapons qualification because they're not just going to send him if he's not "calibrated" to his assigned weapon.  This may take weeks...maybe a month at most.     If he is assigned to a unit that is already deployed, it is the responsibility of the Rear Detachment to ensure that they are fully ready (physically, mentally, financially and legally) before shipping them out to war.  If a Soldier out of AIT needs to take care of financial or family issues, then those needs are met.  We don't just slap them out into the warzone and say "do your job" if they have issues that need to be resolved prior to deployment.      I cannot give a specific timeline because each unit is different.  He might get lucky and get into a unit that either just got back or is prepping for deployment.  In either instance, the same measures are taken to make sure that he is ready to deploy at a moment's notice.    As far as living conditions, he will be living in the barracks on post for as long as he is single.  If y'all decide to get married, then he has the option to live in on-post housing or off the economy.  In Iraq, everyone lives in trailers.  In some locations, they are pre-wired for internet and cable.  You'll still be able to talk via webcam and even talk with him if he takes a laptop with him and downloads Skype and programs a US phone number.    Hope this puts your mind at ease a little.

Politicians do not come from the sky,they are from the same society. when the entire society - entire polity become corrupt at large polititicians are bound to be corrupted. In your another question I have posted answer as to why the corrupt people are organised. To the honest lot, the only way to organise themselves ironically is the political parties and social organisations. But paradox is that instead of attach in the honest people they used to detach them.Yet another way to organise the honest people is the democratic process. But again it is the people who elect murderer, rapist, goons as their representative in our rotten democratic process. But  within the politicians honesty is never absent to many, but who cares ?

And he described what is happening as a massive collision on the global economic highway that has caused all traffic to come to a stand still. He said that the wreckage has to be removed before the traffic will flow again.     Like I said. I don't think anyone knows what the hell they're doing. They have a goal. They want to globalize. And they're trying to learn as they go.      Meanwhile governments are trying to ease the pain of globalization by spending money on infrastructre programs and giving tax cuts.

Now assume we take a screwdriver and jam a hole in the bottom of the bucket and say that represents the housing crisis -- the escaping water is actually people losing money -- the credit markets freezing up (no loans/no credit cards/reduced credit lines/etc) - home equity lines of credit freezing up - spending stops -- businesses suffer -- people laid off -- more spending stops -- more businesses suffer -- more people laid off...it's a vicious cycle that won't stop for a while.    So now you have a bucket filled with water representing 14 trillion dollars worth of economic activity -- but as the clock ticks it drops to 13.9 trillion...13.6 trillion....13.2 trillion...okay?    The water is going to leak until consumer spending (demand) matches the products/service supplied (supply).  Basic economics tells us when demand goes down -- and supply stays the same...the price must drop to a new equilibrium where output and supply must also recede (businesses scale back).  The same thing applies here.    So -- we need to find some way to increase demand.    What the stimulus proposes is that we inject more money into the market to offset the amount of economic activity escaping.    Let the water hose represent the stimulus.  If we turn the water on and pour it into the bucket (inject money via infrastructure investments) -- we can theoretically slow the rate at which the economic activity is decreasing.  You'll have water leaking out of the bottom (loss of activity) and water being poured into the top (increased activity).      Essentially what it does is creates an artificial bottom or an equilibrium at a higher point than would be demanded by conventional usage of the law of supply, the law of demand and the point at which they cross, the equilibrium.    However -- if for some reason the hose stops pumping water (we run out of money in the stimulus w/in 4 years) before the leak on the bottom of the bucket is fixed (the economy hasn't experienced any growth and consumers haven't replaced the government spending with their own), then the free-market will take over and "drain" economic activity until we reach the true supply and demand equilibrium....say economic activity at 7 trillion instead of 14 trillion.    What the stimulus proposed to do is create a support somewhere between 7 and 14 trillion until consumers are willing and capable of spending again to support business and subsequent economic growth/strength.      The question is:  1.  Is the stimulus big enough?  (Can we keep the hose running long enough to plug the leak in the bottom of the bucket?)  2.  If the hose does dry up, what do we do?  Does the government ask for "stimulus II" and do taxpayers approve it?  Or do we say "nope, didn't work -- let the free-market take over and we'll take our chances that we'll only be in the trough for a short period of time before we experience growth/expansion.    Remember the natural business cycles are:    Expansion - Peak - Contraction - Trough - Expansion - Peak - Cont....    We're in a contraction period sliding into a trough -- and the unknowns are how deep will we go (can it drop to 5 trillion...3 trillion...probably not)?  And how long will wel be here (2 years, 5 years, 10  years)?    This is the problem I see.  The stimulus only uses 300 billion dollars of direct investment in infrastructure.  The annual economic activity is 14 TRILLION dollars.  And the 300 billion is spread over 4 years.  I don't think it'll make a noticeable impact.  The trickle from the hose will be no match for the hole in the bottom of the bucket and I believe we'll see no slowing in the loss rate of economic activity.  That is to say the trickle from the top (government spending) will be no match for the gaping hole at the bottom (free-market correction).    I think it's the foot in the door and the Administration will be back asking for more money soon.  It's already rumored that the banks are going to get another "bailout" to the tune of 2.2 trillion dollars.    When will it stop?  It's lunacy.    The government likes to talk about "kick starts" and instigating growth through these types of programs but it couldn't be further from the truth...the injection of money isn't big enough.      It doesn't matter how much money we inject, we're subject to the workings of the natural business cycle in the free-market.  In other words, until we plug the hole in the bottom of the bucket, there's nothing we can do to maintain our 14 trillion dollar peak (absent of spending trillions of dollars to maintain that value).  The rate of economic loss will still be the difference between the amount that leaks out daily and the amount we hose in.

433571011989f7699b6947635139e845aa	It will make your application more desirable.  However, you will still have to qualify and meet the training requirements of whatever state you live in.  Most will require you attend the fire academy for a sort of basic training and more and more are requiring degrees in fire science for any sort of promotion.  Additionally, more and more areas have gone to volunteer fire departments, with only a few paid slots so there is lots of competition for them.  The military background will help, but if you truely want to make this a career on the civilian side, start working on your degree now.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	hell no they are laying off .|`|1KGXts5Daa	The civilian fire service is very much a "para-military" organization.    You will find many similarities with regard to rank, seniority, command structure, fireground/incident tactics and strategies, terminology, chain-of-command, order and discipline, station duties, etc. - not to mention the experience of working as a member of a team under stressful conditions - with lives at stake.    Most municipal fire departments give bonus points (usually 5) on the civil service exam to all honorably-discharged military service-members.    Also, most large metropolitan departments assign hiring priority (under federal, state, and local "Affirmative Action" hiring and promotion policies) to anyone of a race or nationality other than caucasian - which may, or may not, be to your advantage.    Any firefighter training and experience you receive (structural, Aircraft Rescue FireFighting-ARFF-, vegetation, vehicle, other) in the Marines will be an advantage to you when it comes to completing the academics and practical skills at Fire Academy.    Of equal importance is any emergency medicine/treatment knowledge and skills you are able to acquire in the military.  They will prove helpful during your EMT (or Paramedic) course.    Also, any specialized training or certification related to Hazardous Materials, Confined Space Rescue, High-Angle Rescue, Swift Water Rescue, Vehicle Extrication, general construction, fire prevention inspection practices, fire origin/cause investigation, general chemistry, and WMD-nuclear, radiological, chemical, biological, etiological agents will give you an advantage over many other "Probies" (Probationary Entry-Level Firefighters) who have yet to acquire any knowledge or skills in those fields - all of which are parts of a professional firefighters acquired knowledge skill-set.    Enrolling in fire science classes at the community college level is the best thing you could do after you leave the military.  Obtaining an Associates (AA or AS) degree in Fire Science (60 units) should be high on your list of priorities if you are serious about a career in the fire service.  Most professional firefighters have at least an Associates degree, and many have either a BA or BS (usually in Public Administration).    A career in the professional fire service is one that many desire, but few are able to obtain - with a "rule of thumb" being that the top 2% of any group of applicants will make it all the way through the process and get hired.    But I can tell you from experience, it is well worth the effort!|`|c88d6a4b2e8a26ac9bd239980605f6f8aa	Probably; but, most city fire departments will require you to complete an application, and upon acceptance, complete any courses required by that city.|`|AA11156037	A previous question has you going into the ARMY.  Make up your mind.    If you are a Fire Fighter, sure.  You will probably have to pull a certified Fire Fighting course with whatever municipality you are applying for local techniques/ practices.

Several Departments have an age cutoff so if you finish out a military carreeer before applying you may age out.  Your certifications as a Marine Firefighter may not transfer to the state level, you would have to request reciprocity or recertify.|`|A6UPTz4caa	Being a Fire Dog in the Marines is a very physical and skill demanding job. They drill almost everyday. If you do choose this route, you should be able to get a job at any fire department in the world. But why leave the Marines? Stay in for 20 years and retire.
Uxe1GjP0aa	No. You have to follow what you think is best for your career and doing something you obviously have a genuine desire to do should be supported by those who wish to see you happy. However, life in the military isn't all that easy for girlfriends so you have to deal with the fact that she may leave you and accept it as part of the package. It would be unfair to her to force her to live a lifestyle that would not agree with her personality or her career ambitions.|`|1NCPPHR9aa	If she loves you she will encourage you to follow your dreams . You are not selfish,  But maybe she has something better to offer you. Idk but are you planning to marry her? Be careful that she doesn't try to control you completely. You should follow your dreams.|`|w87icQkoaa	No, you are definitely not selfish! I applaud you for wanting to serve our country. It is your future you're thinking of, and that is in no way possibly being selfish. She is being selfish for not supporting you with what you want to do with your life. You do what you need to do. There are plenty of girls out there for you. She doesn't seem like one that you would want to be with for the rest of your life, anyways. The Navy, (or any branch of military) is a tough decision that will affect you for the rest of your life. If you really want to do it, go for it full throttle, and don't look back.|`|jOyzcJd7aa	NO! Your not selfish at all, it's selfish of her to ask you to give up your dreams. If she really loved you she should support her as you should support her when it comes to her dreams. Don't be in such a rush, there's a girl out there who will hold your hand through everything!|`|57N8Ls5Oaa	No she is the selfish one.  Sounds like a spoiled selfish brat.  Go ahead and join either she will support you or she won't.  But doesn't loving someone, make you want them to be happy and fulfill their dreams?|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Your girlfriend is not worth your time if she threatens to leave you if you join the military. Love and commitment are supposed to last forever, and if she can't even stay behind and be faithful for a few years that's sad. My ex-fiance joined the Marines after we had been together for over a year. It was hard, I won't lie. But if she loves you she would attempt to help you in your dream of becoming a Navy Seal and not hold you back.     You are not being selfish - she is. Don't let go of your dream. If she isn't willing to be a military girlfriend, leave her. There are thousands upon thousands of women out there who would love you and support your job. She sounds very young and foolish.|`|KkY5CKlaaa	She should support you no matter what you do if she really loves you.  My husband is in Afghanistan right now.  I know he didn't choose to go there  but he did choose to be in the army and I support that.  Maybe she is afraid of losing you.  She should be proud of the fact that you want to serve your country.  There has to be something more to it for her and she just isn't opening up and telling you.  Good luck|`|UlQpadSQaa	military will **** up ur family life, and if u ever plan on starting a family i suggest u drop that dream rite now.|`|uGQ1WtYtaa	pshh.. If she loves you then she'll stick by you. Do you know how many military wives.fiances and girlfriends there are out there who are away form there soldiers for 12 to 15 months at a time, and they defiantly aren't selfish! She should be proud that you are thinking about joining and stop being selfish her self. Maybe compromise on the job you'll do get a desk job or a recruiting job so you'll have less chance of seeing combat, you'll be fine. Just do what you think is best, and honestly, how old are you? And how long have you been together? Do you really think she'll be with you for the rest of your life. I think you'll regret it if you don't, because it'll always be in the back of your mid.."what would've happened if I would've joined the military?" It'll make you a better man, and you'll be serving your country and you can have something amazing to be proud of!     My mans in the Army and I wouldn't have it any other way, because it was his dream and I couldn't see him doing anything else.      Shes being selfish not you.  & if you end up staying with her, you'll prolly end up resenting her for not letting you join.    -Proud Army Fiancee!|`|A6UPTz4caa	I'm no professional when it comes to relationships but I'll try to give you some advice from my past experiences. First off, what does she have against the military? It is a great opportunity for anyone. Free college, job security, and a guaranteed paycheck every two weeks. With today's economy, the military is a very viable choice. I would look at it from this point of view. If she really loved you and wasn't being selfish herself, she wouldn't have issues with you joining the military. She should be proud that you want to do your part and serve your country. If anything, you would be representing all that is unselfish. Risking your life for the people and country that you love, including her.    Maybe if you did some research to show her in black and white all of the benefits that the military has to offer, which is a lot, she might change her mind. I've been in the Marines for 6 years. I've deployed many times but now I am stationed in Hawaii for three years and I'm at a non-deployable unit. I sit in Hawaii and soak up the sun and enjoy life. Free housing and free medical care. Free college for you and she even gets money for college now just for being married to an active duty military member. Tell her that this is your dream. You want to be a part of something bigger than yourself. If she can't understand that and support your decision or even consider it, then maybe she should re-evaluate her definition of selfish.|`|TR1ap48Paa	I know what you're going through but i was on the other side.. i was the gf. You're not really being selfish.. but you are choosing your career over her, kind of. Because of all the time away from her, your relationship might not work out.   It's your life so do what makes you happy. But your girlfriend might be afraid because of the distance and all the hard things you have to go through in the military if you're in a relationship.  She might also be afraid for your safety.. i know i was.. and thats normal since there's a war going on.  You need to decide if she's worth it.. i mean, explain it to her better because she might just be judging the military life without knowing much about it. I was..   If you plan on marrying her, then do it, that way she can come with you and stuff.   My bf wouldn't change his mind,, it was his dream..   i was planning on leaving him for it too.   But I didn't, i knew he was going to do it no matter what i said, and i got over it and accepted it.  Now we're married and im living with him and even though its realllyyyyyyy tough to be away from family, its not as bad as i thought it was going to be.    Good luck! =)|`|PpcuGhemaa	First Question is do you want to marry her? If so then I would consider not joining. Being on the other side my future wife is in the navy and having her gone sucks. We cant plan our wedding because she cant get a straight answer out of her command about anything. Also realize that you most likely will not be a seal no matter when bullshit your recruiter feeds you.   As for all the benefits, there great if your going to go career but in the end in 4 years most are in the same position that went in with as far as marketable career skills. Some employers look favorably on military service, the field I work could care less.  The upside is that many people do very well in military life, of my friends both college and high school, the ones that weren't as smart have eaten it up. (i.e my ranch hand/college drop out buddies) My friends that were good students and a little more motivated haven't faired as well. 2 wash outs and one acholic so far.

The reason, the F-22 Raptor air superiority fighter.      Of course we have better stuff in Area 51, but why would you need to expose a secret plane to an air force that hides in caves whenever you take to the air?     Oh, and there's nothing interesting in the so-called Area 51.|`|IBs900Hkaa	F22 Raptor|`|Z391sLTcaa	At this moment in time its probably a close tie between the F22 Raptor and The EF typhoon (eurofighter), in most respects to weapon loads and beyond the horizon missiles etc they are very similar, where there are differences is the F-22 is more stealthy, however against eurofighter sophisticated locating systems, and working in conjuction with the uks newest destroyers type 45 (now the worlds most advanced warship) they would be able to locate an f22, and dont forget the EF Typhoon also has a very low radar cross section itself, aswell as the most sophisticated jamming systems, The F22 is also a lot heavier and slower than ef typhoon, ityphoon is the only aircraft that can do acrobatic manouvers while still maintaining supersonic speeds, It also has an incredibly sophisticated interacted cockpit, a system which has been adopted by the US for the raptor, in reality a one on one fight between these two is going to be decided by who gets the first shot, The Raptor might have a marginal upperhand in this, so long as Typhoon wasnt faceing head on (low radar visiblilty), and even then once the raptor has fired, the Typhoon is super agile and may be able to evade it, if that happened the raptor would have revealed its position and in a fight where the stealth aspect is removed then the ef typhoon would be the victor! either way though these planes are possibly the best in the world at present, and are unlikely to ever face off in combat, but if the unthinkable happened and the EU and US were at war then the europeans would be able to field far more Ef Typhoons as the costs of building is half the price compared to a Raptor, so air dominace might be achieved by the europeans, an equaly capable aircraft in far greater numbers, when it comes to value for money id go for Typhoon.. but i bet the russians would argue differently with there S37, i dont think anyone would disagree that this plane has amazing agility and the tech involved is almost as good as the europeans and americans, its a bold design that works well and is musch cheaper than both the western planes to build.    europe has already looking to around 500 Ef Typhoons, while the US congress has capped he amount of Rapters to 183,In anycase in a full on war, in the skies over the atlantic, the europeans would dominate. against any other nation including china the raptor will be a devasting fighter and will not be matched in combat and would evade there less sosphistacated radars with ease. for overall bang for buck, typhoon is best!|`|1uL7coBcaa	F-22 Raptor. That Plane is super fast.|`|AiqQgy0faa	f22 it can lock on to multiple aircraft from far distances.  it kills everything else before they know it's even there.|`|zZoIvLgKaa	F 22 Raptor, but not absolutely because it depends on the pilot controlling the aircraft. An F 22 can still be shot down when its counterpart's pilot is better.|`|ymZlFYn1aa	The F-22 Raptor is the best.|`|kqW5WdQcaa	The F-22 is the best in the world in air combat, because it is one of few aircraft (other than the F-117 and B-2) that possess near-complete stealth capability.  That means it cannot be targeted by radar, which makes it almost invulnerable to radar missile lock.  It is the only 5th-generation fighter in the world (acknowledged by not only the U.S., but Russia, China, and the E.U. forces also).   F-22s engaged and destroyed six F-15's in an Air Force mock-dogfight in Alaska, single-handedly (1 vs. 6) multiple times.  Look up Operation Northern Edge Alaska 2006.  That's how good it is.

It is good practice though to be visible, as the purpose is not just to catch, but also demonstrate the fact that the police are out there enforcing speed limits. They can't do that in hiding.    How do you catch people speeding if you advertise it ? I mean, it's published on the internet, advertised on roadsigns, available as a satnav download, you can get devices that tell you where they are, and they still need to be in line of sight of the road....! How much more do we need to do ? Sorry, but if you get gatso'd, you really haven't been paying attention.    Part of the aim should also be to make people look more closely at their surroundings, even if it is for police vans..! This would hopefully help in spotting hidden dangers.    But, on the bright side, YOU noticed it.... so don't worry about it...!
oFiGyMWraa	You have rights under the Sale of Goods Act for the goods to be of satisfactory quality, free from defects etc. Those rights exist whether or not you have a receipt, because the actual contract is concluded before you hand your money over. The receipt is just a record that there was a contract. But if the shop wants to avoid their responsibilities they can use the lack of a receipt to avoid helping you.    Hypothetically, if you took them to court with no receipt it would be up to the judge if he believed that you bought the goods when you said you did. If you had a witness to back your story up that would help. If you had packaging from the shop in question that would also help. But a receipt is irrefutable evidence of your purchase.    A Switch receipt is useful evidence but is not definitive. It may be enough to convince the shop but it may not. Most shops have computerised systems, so there may be a reference number on the receipt that lets them identify the transaction.|`|EBqFpZbjaa	You have rights - check out the links below - and there is NO time limit, in spite of the waffle given to cutomers by some shops.    http://www.monikie.org.uk/yourrights.htm    http://www.hiebusiness.co.uk/bdotg/actio...    http://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/bdotg/ac...

noo8vpvzaa	Maybe it was the same accountants the Clintons used.    In 1994 The Clintons paid the Internal Revenue Service and the Arkansas state government $14,615 in back taxes and interest, after failing to report profits from a commodities-trading venture to the IRS. They said it was simply a mistake, an "oversight".    Democrats seem to have a little trouble reporting income and keeping their taxes straight.    Also:    Clintons Charity Not Listed On Senate Disclosure Forms    Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and former president Bill Clinton have operated a family charity since 2001, but she failed to list it on annual Senate financial disclosure reports on five occasions.     The Ethics in Government Act requires members of Congress to disclose positions they hold with any outside entity, including nonprofit foundations.     Hillary Clinton has served her family foundation as treasurer and secretary since it was established in December 2001, but none of her ethics reports since then have disclosed that fact.     The foundation has enabled the Clintons to write off more than $5 million from their taxable personal income since 2001, while dispensing $1.25 million in charitable contributions over that period.     Clintons spokesman said her failure to report the existence of the family foundation and the senators position as an officer was an "oversight."      If these people can't keep track of their OWN finances and taxes, how on earth can we trust them with OURS?|`|bhOn6uWQaa	Tim did his own taxes and he didn't screw up.

I don't believe anyone should put anything before American.  I think it's ridiculous.  I don't go around saying I'm Armenian American.  Funny, I'm Armenian, born in Australia, living in America.  Does that make me an Armenian Australian American?  To heck with it.  I am proud of who I am.  I am proud to be an American.  Besides, no one ever wrote a song called proud to be an Armenian American, or whatever.  Besides, not all black people hail from Africa.  I met a man once that was black.  He got extremely offended when someone referred to him as African-American.  He corrected them and said, "I am not African, have never been to Africa, nor have my parents."  Turns out, in fact, he was an Aborigine from Australia and was visiting America as a college exchange student.      Back in the 70s and 80s, there were Blacks, Whites, Indians, Asians.

GL2xOdYfaa	If you are new to the world of loans, then all the jargon and terminology can seem very confusing. There are so many different terms to understand, and unless you know some of them you will not find the best loan deal to suit your needs. If you want to know more, then here is a guide to some of the basic loan terms you might need to know.    http://www.worldbestloans.com/    The lower the APR, then the cheaper the loan interest will be. Credit scoring is a method that lenders use to determine your eligibility for a loan. They ask a series of questions about your earnings and financial situation. Each answer you give is scored, and the better your score then the more likely you are to be accepted for a loan.

It's not like Hitler was going to get the the Atlantic ocean in Europe and say "yah... dis is good enough for da Fuhrer... no need for America too"|`|ScZPVCUpaa	FDR went to great lengths to convince America to get involved in WW2 by promoting the "Lend Lease" act, which he said was like lending your garden hose to your neighbor whose house was burning.  America was isolationist after WW1, thinking Europe should solve its own problems.  But Lend Lease allowed us to help England financially before we actually declared war after Pearl Harbor.  England and Russia fought the Germans with everything they had.  But I think it's fair to say that our entrance into the war enabled England to survive as a nation.|`|AA10444571	No,you didn't,and you couldn't...the war was decided first by the inability of the Germans to land and conquer England(anything else was just a matter of time...as it was said elsewhere) and the inevitability of the  attack against the Soviet Union which was being planned by general Paulus as early as the summer of 1940 under direct secret order from Hitler,even before the air attack against England had begun...   Only the Soviet Union had the ability and the quality of material on land(ex:T34-the most succesful tank inWW2-etc) to trade space for time,to originally fend of and then defeat the German army...  The US didn't even feature at par with such powers at that time,with 60-70 inexperienced divisions-against 325 german divisions in 1942,most of them veterans-it was like a...pin-prick in the side of Germany.   In 1944 the allied landing in Normandy took place against 80 German divisions,broken in the eastern front.  So you didn't save England in 1940,the British Channel along with the British fleet were more than enough to prevent German landings...  the assistance you gave in the form of Lend-Lease was well placed since you new that if England fell you would be next in line...|`|70QRG1afaa	lol, true.

One of my former commanding Officers is female and I found her to be a competent, efficient CO.     What are you trying to talk her out of? Training, pay and benefits, college money, veteran's preference hiring, confidence and physical conditioning, and the honor of serving are all part of enlisting.

JDltTREfaa	Good grief.  Do you honestly think that you can and should sue over a mistake?  Don't answer.  I know we live in an "I'm gonna sue you" culture but c'mon already!  They apologized.  Obviously they are going to fix the problem.  What exactly do you think you're entitled to get?  A lawsuit is supposed to make the victim "whole."  Essentially, to return the victim to the financial condition they would have been in if the bank had not made the mistake.  If the bank apologized and fixed your account you don't have any damages!|`|64SObnr5aa	I used to know a guy who would constantly threaten to sue people and businesses for their perceived wrongs. One day I told him to STFU and grow up, that he's never sued anyone in his life and never will because all this harm done to him is all in his head.    He then threatened to sue me.    The moral of the story, is you must have been damaged and there was no offer to relieve those damages,    I have had the same thing happen to me, a paycheck that was not posted and multiple bounced checks.  I calmly went down to the bank, told them I deposited the check and provided the ATM receipt.  They said they could find no record but would contact me that afternoon.  They contacted me late that morning with a full apology, that the check was lost and they ended up paying for all the fees, wrote letters to all the businesses claiming full fault and of course reversed all charges.    You need to provide proof of damages.  Just because it was an inconvenience and nothing more does not mean damages.    If it means that the hospital refused to give your child life saving treatment because of a bounced check for her illness and it resulted in her death, then you may have a case, but probably a better one against the hospital.

sX9Ilrpxaa	Poor people often suffer from obesity for several reasons.  The first is that poverty is often linked to lack of education.  If you don't get a good education, chances are that you will not know as much about proper nutrition.  Therefore they are likely to make bad food choices, not because they are stupid, but because they do not know any better.  Another reason is that most poor people lack adequate access to healthcare.  Without a doctor telling them what overweight for them is, or how to correct the problem, they probably won't be able to do much.  The third is food prices.  Have you ever noticed how it is expensive to eat healthy?  Fresh fruits and vegetables and lean meat cost more at your average supermarket than processed foods high in fat and sugar.  Even if a poor person knows how to and wants to eat right, they might not be able to afford it.  After all, most people would rather eat unhealthily than be hungry.      Though it doesn't generate the immediate rush of sympathy that starving children in developing countries do, it is indeed a serious nutritional and public health problem.  Poor people generally have worse health, and since they are less likely to have insurance, their medical treatment ends up costing taxpayers a lot of money. The US needs to make some policy changes to work on this issue, because there is no reason that the one of the richest nations in the world should have people living in it who can't afford to be healthy.  How we take care of this may or may not change with the new administration, but at least the issue is being brought to everyone's attention.    That's my two cents, I hope it helps.|`|sLEdPDkHaa	sounds like the wrapped liberal view of America we are so poor but we suffer from obesity lol the real poor nations do not have obesity ie Somalia Ethiopia etc etc they are all stick people who really go hungry!|`|cRDbeUDvaa	What part of it didn't you understand?|`|XYTUAzzgaa	sounds like the food stamp program is about to get a makeover...so i guess those folks better get a job because the days of laying back watching oprah with 3 big bags of lay's is coming to an end.|`|noo8vpvzaa	Yeah, people in America are starving...that's why the poor are so fat...

EDIT:    The price of a bag of potato chips would buy a pound of pork chops    The price of a 12 pack of soda would buy 2 pounds of sausage or 5 pounds of pinto beans    The price of a bag of candy would buy 4 cartons of eggs    The price of one whole cake from the bakery would buy 10 pounds of potatoes, 2 pounds of carrots AND a 1 pound beef roast    The price of a bag of cookies would buy 2 whole chickens    The price of a carton of ice-cream would buy 6 cans of tuna    It's all about personal choices and responsibility|`|QgD4Cbb7aa	I gave up a long time ago trying to make sense of Obama.|`|dtq32xuwaa	you have to understand hes a private chef. probably refuses to touch non prime cut steak. wouldnt really know anything about being poor and hungry if it bit him in the kitchen|`|NXGCUotGaa	yea he wants the federal government to take more control over what people eat. and he wants to feed the entire planet even though we don't feed everyone in america. he wants to give the united nations piles of money that will never be used for anything. since there some of most crooked people on planet. and he wants to do this even though we are broke...|`|m8OJuOgGaa	There are 2 types of people:  a) those who are severely poor and hence die of starvation, eg developing countries such as African countries, and  b) those who are of low financial income  (eg Western countries such as the USA), who are not destitute as the above group, but nake wrong food choices and hence have to deal with health issues related to malnutrition.|`|Zcrlqz6Raa	Poor people are not usually obese because they are gluttens but rather due to the fact that foods that are high in fat and carbohydrates  tend to be cheaper than good and wholesome foods such as fresh veggies and fruits.

56f857adccfe97c5b5197529fd3759b6aa	If the case relates to a personal civil grievance with the employee, there is no need to get any permission.     If it involves his mis use of position in office etc, because of which you were affected in any way, then you would have to first take the matter to his dept head first and if there is no action taken in reasonable time you may sue the employee along with the superiors who did not take cognizance of your complaint. A vakil would give you advice on this.     In matters of criminal offense, like cheating, you can lodge police complaint straight away.. In such cases, only the police would inform his office authorities if the employee is arrested, to have him suspended from duty and to proceed against him as per law.    It is not our business to approach the dept in such cases.
hJNwAHccaa	AR 220-45 Duty Rosters (dtd 15 Nov 1975) clearly states that "a person's name may be omitted or deleted from any duty roster when he is excused from or not qualified to perform the duty concerned."    Exemptions on the duty roster are purely at the discretion of the unit 1SG.  If he wants to exempt those who are PCSing 30 days out, then he can.  In the same respect, he can also keep you on the duty roster until you start clearing.  When you are clearing, you're obviously not qualified to perform Staff Duty or any other detail.     Yes...even though this is dated 1975, it is the most current regulation on duty rosters.  As you read through it, you will see it is very vague.  Exemptions and the methods to the exemptions is solely up to the Chain of Command.

6Fp1KVIKaa	Though it does happen and every time its a tragedy. I believe much of the soldiers committing suicide are a myth propagated by the media. They do this so that they can be anti-military without being anti-troops by portraying us all as victims of circumstance.      I think if you look at the numbers between soldiers and civilians and take into account age demographics.  The suicide rate in the Army has only surpassed that of the US civilian population in the last couple of years.  This is mostly due in large part to the ongoing stress of repeated deployments.  Also, as a whole the military is younger than most professions due to the large base of the enlisted corps.     However, having come back from my first deployment in a pretty bad state of mind, I can tell you that there are some issues.  For one as a Soldier, Airman, Sailor, or Marine you feel cut off from the rest of the American society upon your return; like an outsider.  Also, while deployed you are in an almost constant state of readiness that can be very stressful.  Many times that stress doesnt show until you get back to the states and all of the sudden it stops.  No slow release it just stops.  Stress can do funny things on the human mind.  Also, they have been away from their families and the readjustment back to a civilian after work life can be difficult.  A big thing for me as a single Airman who worked with the Army was that the military was like a family and we did not all come back together and I felt like I was abandoning my brothers in their time of need.      There are many reasons and I am happy to say that finally many are being addressed by programs like the Minnesota National Guards "Beyond the yellow ribbon" program that helps soldiers readjust back to life in the states.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	It is not abnormally high.    A a fact the media always seems to leave out.    Over 70% of the military suicides, have never deployed.    You basically have a military that has a huge percentage that is under 21 years old.    And that's the largest group that commit suicide.|`|AWCx0Blzaa	Post traumatic stress disorder from their deployment or during because they are in an infantry unit and have get ambushed often and have to fire, they see people in their unit get hit/killed by fire, IED and have no choice but to defend themselves and fire, you can't see the enemy, guerrila tactics.  They can't cope with what they have just done or seen and/or go back home and realize that they have been changed by their experience and their family has changed and can't relate/talk to anybody, or their spouses have cheated. Or joined the military for economic reasons are single and have no one at all to talk to back home and aren't mentally ready for deployment. Commanders can override a psychologist's recommendation against deployment. Reintegration process lasts one month and often does not do follow ups for those that seemed okay but later can't cope.|`|CdlSbr0aaa	well Ive haven't been in the military but Im leaving for the marines in septemeber.

The unemployment rate, is determined by a monthly survey of 60,000 households.    It is not an exact count of those unemployed.    Since people who do not want to work ( mother raising a child ) Etc.    Aren't considered unemployed.    But the rate does show the trend in employment,    IE: going up or going down.    Since there is no Federal Office employers must notify everytime an employee quits, is fired or layed off.    There is no accurate way to track unemployment.

If convicted,  your DUI is a misdemeanor, and it falls under the category of "crimes of moral turpitude". Generally you would need to be sentenced for one year (regardless of actual time served) for a single misdemeanor of this type to affect your citizenship.       If convicted, your citizenship application could possibly be denied. As I said they generally are not, but the interviewer will look closely at any other character issues he/she thinks you have and they can deny you at their discretion.      This single crime does not put you at risk for deportation as some have suggested. Two crimes in this category would automatically result in a denial of citizenship and subject you to the possibility of deportation.|`|m331KW7Taa	Asta Sergio.

If you are cleared, then no problem, your citizenship application will proceed.  If you are convicted, it is likely that it will be denied.|`|AA10045620	Yes, it sounds like your prospects at citizenship have dimmed quite a bit.  It is very possible that you will be denied because of your actions.

Your actions will be used in your immigration determination.|`|RWwNLEuMaa	There is a good moral character aspect of your application for Naturalization. When your court case is resolved they will take the official findings into consideration. Until then your case is on hold. You might download the Guide to Naturalization or contact an immigration attorney in the meantime to see if you can get any further guidance there.

Pre-trial? sentencing?|`|6y94LMmqaa	Yes it is extremely possible she will see some jail time. Ultimately it is up to the judge and his day... for misdemeanor up to one year, felony 1 year plus but you can get out for good behavior etc. she could get off, however if guilty she may just get probation and slap on the wrist its up to the judge.

The UN's World Court at the Hague has charged big countries with war crimes (the United States is not one of them) and small ones.    That the US is under closer scrutiny is not a bad thing.

k4Z46Ni3aa	I really don't know, I think they're so confused they don't even know what they want because usually white supremacists want to kill our first African-American president,even if he is part white and in racist websites they talk cruelly about him along with his family especially creating pictures of them calling him Obongo like this :http://celebrityapes.com/wp-content/uplo... http://www.pleasegodno.com/uploads/obama... I think they're lying that they're happy for Obama is because they may harass some black people(like for say if there's a black person alone walking) like ones did in the past when blacks weren't treated right at the time when Martin Luther King Jr was alive or mayy think they will get the chance to murder Obama.Hey, maybe the ones who are happy are probably not racists anymore,like the fact that Obama is part white, or since a black person became president they couldn't believe it and gave up.Who knows.|`|rUNlmQG5aa	You must be miss-aligned.|`|pueeMH6gaa	I don't really care what they think but since the Democratic idiots in congress are funding every fringe group possible under this joke they call a "stimulus package" maybe the nazis are in line for some bailout money and they're happy about that.|`|524ae26534ddf801aecd5122aa2ed234aa	1.

Check out Project Gutenberg, the first producer of free electronic books (ebooks) Send them a photocopy of the title page with publication date and they will clear it for copyright, and then you can scan it. Put it through OCR )( optical character recogniton)  and fix the mistakes and Gutenberg publishes it.|`|w9cicy0Daa	Frankly, there is no restriction if the copyright has expired and the work is in the public domain; except that copyright expiry dates differ between countries. You can republish it as you see fit, design a new cover, reset the typography etc. You can publish electronically or in print and you can even copyright you edition.    I have published two books that out of copyright.|`|5BiBamrxaa	Copyright for literary works is Authors life + 70 years.  So if first published in 1917 then copyright will more than likely still exist on the work depending on when the author died.|`|AA10206116	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_doma...    You'll find your answer there. Someone does actually still own the copyright, but after 50 years, unless they renew it, they cannot collect royalties. You still need to buy the rights from them though if you want to reprint it I believe.

Create jobs, yes it will, but I nowhere near trust the numbers.    Put America back on the path to recovery?  Yes, to a point.  The private sector needs to get rid of its top heavy administration and salaries before it lays off the little guy.    We need to put controls in place that no longer allow the huge box stores wholesale buying power, so the little guy can once again thrive and all the box stores can sell themselves on is convenience, instead of low price always.

He is doing what the economists are telling him is right, even though it is a repeat of most of the Bush policies.  Bush cut taxes three times in the first two years of his presidency.  You can see where that got us.  I don't think anything is going to fix the current economy.

T4C4r5sbaa	The actual proposed bill is called the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.    Here is a summary from the link below:    American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  A bill to create jobs, restore economic growth, and strengthen America's middle class through measures that modernize the nation's infrastructure, enhance America's energy independence, expand educational opportunities, preserve and improve affordable health care, provide tax relief, and protect those in greatest need, and for other purposes.    Current 111st session of congress OpenCongress Summary:    This is a placeholder for the Senate's yet-to-be-released economic stimulus package, a companion to the House version: H.R.1. The broad outline of the House bill - 60 percent new spending, 40 percent tax cuts - is expected to remain the same in the Senate's version.    Edit:    For example, in the economic stimulus package, there is a provision that states if a small business wants to obtain a loan from the SBA, they cannot hire illegal immigrants (in other words - BUY AMERICAN).      Another provision I located in this bill is called "special rule on contracting" page 181 in which regarding the use of iron and steel produced in the United States "a local educational agency shall not obligate or expend funds received under this provision for a project for the modernization, renovation, or repair of a public school facility unless ALL of the iron and steel used in such project is produced in the United States" (Another Buy American provision).    The Stimulus bill being debated in the House this week can be viewed here:    H.R. 1 - American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|`|LEBV1FPuaa	If did leave we would be stronger with out them and the real Americans.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	w.w.w. com   br549|`|ff4620d7ef5c56f9405c2f52615552f5aa	Well, a law has been passed (Bill H.R. 3997) that if you move out of the USA, all your money and possessions are to be taxed, so I doubt any companies would get away with that attempt.

Since they have been told that he is a black, Muslim socialist with a Harvard education they are very afraid...I like to call this particular disorder Obamaphobia...and irrational fear of anything that he is connected with. It would be too much to ask that they find out the truth I guess. Of course I may be underestimating their intelligence since, according to them,  it seems like all of them have read and can comprehend a 700  page stimulus bill in just a couple of hours!|`|6t76bgS3aa	lol, right on man ... it stems from people who use words like that, we like joe sixpack better|`|68b7fe8af8ba2cd679ce447ab1965dacaa	You are too funny.  I think it comes from negative influences from people that appear on a certain unnamed news station.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Likey the big words, too?    It's not all of them.  In fact, they are at the very least paying lip service to bipartisanship, and it may even be serious.    They are still testing the waters.  They had their *sses handed to them, and they don't know how much support they have; and are pretty sure they can't beat Obama's current support.        The ones losing their minds wiht frivolous and exorbitant abhorrence are those like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.    And in fairness, they make their money off ratings.  That means they have to focus on their target audience.  And their target audience is both afraid and angry.  So Rush and Sean have to kind of play both emotions off of each other to keep them going and strengthening; so they can then make higher ratings when those audience members call in with continued claims of "Muslim" and "non-citizen" until they have worked themselves up into a fevered pitch.      If you get a chance, go to the zoo and visit the chimpanzee exhibit.  Do a couple of "whooop, whooop, whooop, oooh, OOOH, OOOH, AAAHHH, AAAHHH."

Why do the republicans hate the President?   Wow didn't even need and adjective.    Also, why is the grammar of your question screwed up. "Where does the hate from republicans to our President come from?"    Okay now for the answer. It isn't so much hate for the person as it is contempt for his policies and intentions. We believe in personal responsibility over his government dependence.    Also whether Barrack is intelligent or stylish is questionable because the first has yet to be proven and the second is purely opinion.    Well first abhorrence means hate, loathe, detest not fear. Second the word would be "of" our president not "to".    I.E. Fear of flying. Not fear to flying.|`|AA12205000	I'm sure you are trying to sound intelligent, but it would help if you used proper english and spelling.  To answer you question simply, his plans are too expensive, too socialistic, far too left.  Republicans can't help  to notice that President Obama is in a running start to making things worse.  You don't spend more, but leave certain classes out and hope that will improve our economy.  The majority of the people he is planning to help don't even pay taxes.  The people that actually pay the taxes and don't get much of it back, are the ones he is penalizing.  Now you tell me?   If I am loosing more money and I am paying taxes, am I going to hire new employees?  No, I am going to fire people so I can survive myself.       If President Obama wants bipartisan negotiations and not have Republicans demonstrate "inexplicable abhorrence", then he has to give more middle ground.  Just inviting Republicans to negotiations doesn't mean it is bipartisan.  You actually have to give in some as well.    Astute and modish are not words I would use, and if you are in love with the Koolaide, I don't think you can offer an unbiased opinion.|`|zfFjKhJJaa	Obama is a sycophantic, sinister, scurrilous, specious, spineless, sordid, superficial and swindling scallywag....Sorry    Make sure you look all those words up libs, so you know which way to thumbs me|`|FCDKzBONaa	The hate comes from the fact that President Obama is taller, darker, better looking, has better teeth, a better mind, dresses better, can get 2 million people to come out to his inaugeration without one single incident, does what he says he is going to, and does not have a beer belly, missing teeth, is not married to his first cousin, his children are beautiful, respectful, darling and polite, unlike rednecks children who learn to light a burning cross at 2, and have to be homeschooled by poeple who needed to be homeschooled by people who were illiterate because they refused to pick up a book and read iot.  They rednecks of this country hate Pr4esident Obama because they are racist pigs who deserve to live in gitmo, because for all intents and purposes, their hatred against their president and commander in cheif makes them extremists, and terrorists, and that, under their OWN President Bush, and I use the term lightly, makes anyone that harasses, or speaks ill of the President or commander in cheif a terrorist.  That means that the hate really stems from the fact that they really all hate america, american values and american people, and want to terrorize the people of this nation. FOr that they deserve to be incarcerated in as fine a facility as ever had for a terrorist: GOTMO. There is PLENTY of room in gitmo now.  I say re open it, and put these sick, twisted nazi terrorists in there for good, and good riddance.    BUT WAIT!!!..........now im acting just like them. Thats not what president Obama wants. We need to treat these poeple with respect, and empathy. Thats why we need to open special mental facilities, and help these poeple to recover from their trauma of hate. Yes. Thats it. Thats my answer.  Peace.  Love.  Granola bars.  And straightjackets for all.  GOD BLESS AMERICA.

He could be the devil himself, and these clowns would find a way to justify it. As for the Devil thing, the jury is still out, on that one.|`|uFTO5rs8aa	Touting? He mentioned it briefly, to show that he has some common ground with the people of Muslim nations.    He's trying something Bush would never do: honest  diplomacy.

OMG !!!!    were all doomed !|`|mPLXUorTaa	Oh, hi! Welcome to the world of politics!    He's a Christian who has family members, living and dead, who follow/followed the Muslim faith.  When he's talking to people of the Muslim faith, of course he's going to bring up that fact.  That's a way of getting them to relate to him.    Calling President Obama by his full name is totally fine, but Hussein, B Hussein, or Barack Saddam Hussein Obama is completely ignorant and hateful.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	Double standard. Plain and simple.|`|L7BSLB6faa	Please!  President Obama is stating facts . . . and when his middle name was used as an alleged slur, it did need pointing out.      And as far as I am concerned, organized religion is ridiculous.|`|68b7fe8af8ba2cd679ce447ab1965dacaa	He always talked about his heritage.  He said he is not muslim, and he's not.  Muslim is not a nationality.  Why these lame questions?  Do you guys not understand that a person's religion is a choice.  You don't have to be what your parents were?  This is getting weird!    For the morons who said he didn't swear on the bible the second time as though it were intentional, you do realize that if he did not believe in the bible, it wouldn't mean anything to him and he wouldn't care if he swore on it anyway, don't you?|`|NqNbIp2caa	Nobody objected to using his full name. We just pointed out that capitalizing the middle one as if it meant something was very ignorant.|`|CZdFWit7aa	Please. How ignorrant. Please except the fact that he's President and he will be making major decisions for this country no matter how hateful you are. And whats wrong with the middle name Hussein? There are no muslims in my family and we were all raised Christian. But I plan on giving my daughter an Arabic name because of its meaning does that automatically make her a Muslim?

3GXYel3Kaa	I can't give you a specific recommendation, but there are a couple things you should consider.    1. Does your community college system have a channeling program to state universities?  That is, if you complete successfully your course work at your CC, can you automatically be accepted at a state university of your choice?  Some states have such programs, some do not.    2.  Consider how much money you will actually save.  If, for example, there is a state university near your home, it still will be considerably cheaper than going away to college.    3.  Can you actually study your chosen major once you get to a four year institution?  Some majors, especially the sciences, require not only completing certain courses at the four year institution, but require a minimum gpa in those courses.  Some even go further and make you apply to get into a major.  These things may be hampered if you go to a community college first.    There are other considerations, but those are top of the list.

They offer opinions based on facts.  They have as much right to their opinions about news as you do.  Some of them are hard news writers/deliverers.

cNnTgm7maa	I try to keep an open mind to all ideas. Though I have to pick what benefits me and my family. I do not like to see my freedoms taken away. Therefore although I listen to what others have to say, I always seem to be on the far right.     I do not trust the police to protect my family when in danger. I have been a cop, 98% of the time things happen to fast for the police to get there in time to stop the criminal from doing harm to others. Therefore I am a gun owner and own lots of them (ALL LEGAL). Many liberals tend to think all guns are bad. A little fact finding will show the cities and states with the highest rates of violent crime also have the strongest guns laws and the least gun ownership. I.E. D.C, NYC, and so on.     I served my country, and I believe a strong military is essential   to the safety of our nation.     I am a Christian, and I love Jesus. Seems liberals have no problem with any other religion. Though want to restrict when I can pray or celebrate my religion.     I believe criminals belong in jail, I believe murders should receive the same fate there victims did.     I believe a stronger penalty for a so called "Hate" Crime is dumb. If you do the crime you should be punished. Race, sexual preference, is just the motive. We don't punish differntly for why you robbed the bank, we punish for the act, not the motive.     I work hard, and pay taxes (Alot of taxes, lol) I have worked hard to achieve a level of success. I do not like to see my tax dollars going to someone who is to lazy to go to work. Or some woman with 5 kids from 4 different fathers. Maybe you should have been a little more responsible.

But only if they lay off abortion and gays (I know, it's no longer Conservatism without those key issues, but I'm just saying).    While I would never abort my own baby I have no problem letting a woman choose for herself (hey, it could mean one less daddy-less welfare baby my tax money will have to pay for). I'm not gay, but if my next door neighbor wants to marry their homosexual partner, I'm all for it. Love is love and who people want to screw is none of my business.     Liberalism has a problem with rich people. I do not, rich people keep me employed and pay me very well. I have no complaints, I have what I need. I'd rather have the power to choose where I'd like to work and make my own money, not have the government give me what they think I need. I want to make the money I want to have, not work my can off just to give half of it to my neighbor who watches soap operas all day.    What do I think?

It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies.

He didn't just wake up one day and think "I know, I'll get the world to hate me so I'll go to war with Iraq" Honestly it really annoys me when people just point the finger so easily... there were hundreds of people behind the decision to go to war and Bush was probably one of the least influencial.|`|t0gChuAUaa	You need to get your facts straight:http://www.iraqbodycount.org/database/    Total estimated Iraqi civilian casualties: 90,441 - 98,730    That's nearly 100 thousand, tragic yes, but not even close to millions.      Number of people killed on 9/11/01: 2,973    Only three months of the Iraq occupation have the Iraqi civilian death tolls exceeded this number, NOT every month.    While it's very probable that the numbers are slightly higher due to the difficulty of obtaining accurate information, they're nowhere near what you're suggesting.

oIdQaEAUaa	I always feel a little sad that Americans have such an arrogant and selfish view of the world that they are part of - here are some facts ..    1. When the Americans wanted to oust the Russians out of Afghanistan it was Pakistan that recruited, with the help of the CIA, Mujahiddeen and achieve victory. Decades later its these same extremists that are returning to haunt both Pakistan and the US.     2. Pakistanis have captured more high profile terrorists then any other country in the world. Musharaf and now Zardari are doing all they can for America's so-called war on terror.     3. This support has cost the country dearly with more suicide attacks in Pakistan last year than in Iraq! More than 3,000 dead and thousands injured.     4 American drone's constantly attack the borders of Pakistan killing innocent civilians which fuels more anger and more militancy. Let's just bomb Texas because there maybe some Christian extremists there! I wonder how Texans would feel about that?    Pakistan is a sovereign nation (just about) if it is asking America to discuss what they want to do in the Waziristan region. Does it mean Americans are bowing down? It's a ridiculous notion.      Please I urge you not see the world through the limited landscape painted by the American media.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Without any details, there no way of providing a specific answer.    So I shall abstract it for you.    I believe that any govt. should act in accordance to the morality and ethics of its citizens.

The USA, having isolated itself from the global community by bombing everyone, is no longer in receipt of enough support to continue its mono-power strategy.  Don't mess with the Mullah! Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world and it now has nukes.  My advice? Move to China and keep your head down!

There are a billion of them, but you see only a handful of these people doing that.   Just for comparison, over 14,000 of the 16,000 Americans murdered each year are killed by minorities besides Muslims. Hispanics are responsible for most of them.   They arent on some spanish Jihad, there are individual personal reasons for all of them. Poverty and severe disrespect from other races does not help.   I guarantee you I can find examples of all other races committing "Jihadist" type attacks, like the Oklahoma City Bombing, and the Nerve gas attacks on the Tokyo subway.  The truth is that Muslims should be given praise for being the most peaceful major group of people on earth.

They certainly can not go head to head with the US military, so they have found different ways to fight.  They certainly can not kill us in numbers, but they can kill us in public perception, even if their methods seem barbaric.  The Vietnam War proved that.    Are we really that different if we kill them with cluster bombs as opposed to one of their own strapping on explosives?  Sure they kill their own, but if we were not there, then non of that would be happening.    It works    It's war, remember.

It is to protect the public and property owners  Example, in a residential zone, one can not build a junk yard  In a heavy industrial zone, one can not build a home or a government a school.  Etc.    With that being said, I agree with zoning laws to an extent.    If I had a million dollar home, I sure as hell would not want someone to buy the plot next to me and put in a trailer, that would drive my property values down.  But on the other hand, if I had a trailer on a plot of land and someone wanted to build a million dollar home next to mine, I would welcome it.  Eventually I am sure my property values would go up.    However, in this case, I simply do not have enough information.    Is the bungalow a violation of the zoning laws?    If so, by how much?    Will it affect property values?    Has the land been declared part of a environmental clean up?    The reasons are many.    Believe me, I have his sympathy, but I need more information to make an informed decision.

Never mind I found it.  ***********OUTRAGES**********inhumane*... will stand before God someday and have to explain that one.  *********UK**********   NEWS COUNCIL BANS NEW HOME FOR DISABLED HERO  Wednesday January 28,2009    A CRIPPLED soldier is devastated aftecouncilorsrs threw out plans to build him a specially adapted bungalow so he could move home.  Royal Marine Joe Townsend, 20, lost both legs when he stepped on a mine in Helmand, Afghanistan, a year ago.  His grandfather offered to build a wheelchair-friendly bungalow in the grounds of his East Sussex home so Joe could be closer to his family.  But planning officers at Wealden District Council rejected the intrusive plans, even though not one neighbour had complained.

Local council bullies delight in making ordinary folk jump through hoops for basic services that we pay them to deliver.|`|Qqj1VTmXaa	As an ex British soldier myself i find cases like this get me angry, you serve your country see active duty get injured, maimed or killed only to be kicked in the bollocks by pen pushing absolute waste of space people like those that work for local councils. I do not know how someone has the bollocks to throw out plans to build him a specially adapted bungalow so he could move home, because the plans are considered "intrusive" these people are an absolute disgrace|`|715f1626818f5d62fcf3ef5c3b86c820aa	i hate local government,and i threaten them back. people don't understand that when the federal government sold land,for the most part they made it illegal for any government to interfere with property owners. look up land patents. most local governments are run by people on a power trip,a bunch of weasels.   jim zoning laws are nothing but property confiscation,what give anyone right over someone elses land. unless public safety is threatened then zoning is wrong. your rights end at my property line. found story not in US but still an outrage
t82AcQT1aa	Politics is like one big miserable continuing soap opera. Somebody is always screwing somebody else.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	See the start of Fahrenheit 911 for the actual onstage words between Bush and McCain (actually Bush just stands there blinking like a deer in the headlights like he always does) including when Bush used these same groups to accuse McCain of being against Veterens (LOL!)|`|YupMCYHlaa	I lost most of the respect I had for McCain at this time.  After his campaign was destroyed by these slimy smears, McCain showed up at the next Republican candidates' debate and said Bush should be ashamed.  For emphasis, he looked right into Bush's eyes and said "You should be ashamed!"  Bush acted like he didn't know what McCain was talking about. (But then, that's how Bush -always- acted!)    But after that, McCain went off to lick his wounds and decided he should be more of a team player.  So he stopped being a maverick and became a Bush-booster.  He came back to endorse Bush, and the press took this as a surprise so he said "I support Governor Bush.  I support Governor Bush." over and over, like it was joke.    All through Bush's two terms, McCain never criticized him or disagreed with him, at least in public.  And it worked--McCain came from last place to win the nomination in 2008.  But he wasn't able to (or wasn't allowed to) distance himself from Bush, so he gave us no reason to hope that his presidency would be any different.  He reversed his stands on a lot of important issues, things that had gotten him noticed in the first place.    And, the frosting on the cake, though he promised to run a clean campaign, he ended up hiring the same guys who had smeared him in 2000 to come up with smears against Obama.    FDR once said he'd rather be right than be president.  McCain was just the opposite.  He showed that being president was more important to him than his principles.  It was disgusting, but it was also kind of sad because I'd once had a lot of respect for him.|`|c654465d22c58a2c5b0af285003b2789aa	I can make up stuff too but I wouldn't expect any serious answers.|`|ScZPVCUpaa	It was hideous to watch the contempt and ridicule they heaped on him.  I will never understand why McCain stuck around for more abuse.  He used to be a decent guy, but the man he became was a creature of the Republican machine.|`|aVEVchFxaa	Why did McCain forgive Bush for having this country go to war for his vendetta? McCain at one time was totally against the war and Bush. (Can ya say Flip Flop?) I heard about the "mixed race baby", and how old Johnny cheated on the original Mrs. McCain with his new plastic surgery Mrs. McCain. And why did he so-call volunteer to remain a POW? Why did he leave if he liked it there so much? Some of his fellow soldiers said that he was not tortured, and that his story was different than how he told it. So many questions about old Johnny. I sure don't think that he deserves some free ride just because he was in the military. Nor does his story impress me. Many were in the military and held captive, and came back home in a wooden box.|`|Q7ovix19aa	Where do you people get this nonsense?

pueeMH6gaa	The US Military really doesn't exist to build a positive image for itself. It's here to protect Americans and they do a great job.  I'm sure the jihadists and dictators of the world don't care for the US Military that much.  So what?|`|AA11163314	The perception of the US and the US military will be based on the interests of that nation and the amount of exposure their people get to US troops.    For example - the Iraqi people have a great deal of respect and even admiration for US troops.  In their eyes we are competent, generous, and honest.  As Michael Yon put it - every Iraqi kid he met knew about the website 'goarmy.com.'    Other nations have a negative view of US troops because that view reinforces their politics.|`|AA11586960	EDIT Thumbs down read the question this is how i see the US military  i do not trust the US military  1 Good reason US Military :- WW2 we will defend Australia  from the Japanese when you eventually arrived we did not need you we did it ourselfs     Thanks for Nothing when you left you left tons of rubbish behind and never came back to clean up the mess some Friend some allie     No thank you     i don't trust any Military Organisation that promotes its generals in any field of conflict to be the highest rank so as to take over     since 1812 the American military has been a bully they have to much authority even in the USA the military take over where in other countries it is done by the police     I don't care how big your military is they have shown they are Not  "The Best" and Vietnam  Afghanistan and iraq is a perfect example the British have had enough and are leaving i would like the Australians to follow      in WW2 Montgomery was promoted to Field Marshal before DDay and even after dec 1944 when 5 generals were promoted to 5 star monty was the senior general as he could not be promoted any higher and his commander in chief was King George VI where Eisenhower never made 6 star only Washington and Pershing     (from the US Congress) Since the British promotion of Montgomery to outrank ( wrong in payment for a great job in North Africa ) Eisenhower was the trigger to resurrecting the five star plan, Congress had to expand the five star rank beyond the Chiefs of Staff to include the three major theater commanders, MacArthur, Nimitz, and Eisenhower.  The promotion list and dates of elevation, as passed by congress, read as follows:    Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy: December 15, 1944  General of the Army George C. Marshall: December 16, 1944  Fleet Admiral Earnest J. King: December 17, 1944  General of the Army Douglas MacArthur: December 18, 1944  Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz: December 19, 1944  General of the Army: Dwight D. Eisenhower: December 20, 1944  General of the Army Henry H. Arnold: December 21, 1944     to in fact they were all promoted to try and Equal Monty and Monty still outranked Eisenhower  by seniority by 6 months But never made any attempt to take over he just wanted to get on with the Job which he did with Skill and Professionalism and never had his army taken from him    But monty was a 5 year veteran of WW2 and just got on with the Job at the end of the war all 5 stars went back to 3 stars but Monty Died a 5 star as his promotion was for life and not just out rank some one more deserving of the rank Eisenhower stayed behind and directed traffic Monty led the Way     so the USA military only promote their senior generals to out rank any other nation but they don't hold the rank in peace time which shows it is only to take over instead of joining|`|7cei5ifNaa	The best in the world and tuff... don't mess with the US|`|SkWzsnuxaa	The "world" doesn't hold a perception of the US Military. That is only individuals. And just like media, those who like us see us at our best and those who don't, like the New York Times and Al Jazeera only see us at our worst and assume that is the standard. If you ask the Kurdistanis as a group how they see us you will get a very positive result; less so with non-Kurds in Iraq. The militaries I have trained around the world all have a positive view of us. Amazingly enough all who really know us have a positive view. Even those we have held as POWs have viewed the US Military as a strong positive force.|`|o8o689x5aa	No idea.

Clausewitz said, "War is policy by other means".  Put another why, when diplomacy fails, you send in the military.  Their job is to convince the enemy that they are better off with the original (or new) offer.  So the only perception that matters is that they are capable of doing a lot of damage.
dcWGYBfYaa	The deliberate annihilation of Native Americans began in 1400s and continued right up to the present day.    There are those who know the full extent of the Native American genocide, state that it's the worst Holocaust in the history of man.  =======================    Up until the 1980s Native children were forcibly taken from their families and placed in boarding schools. . Children were physically abused, sexually abused and murdered. Documents show more than 50% of the children died in those schools.   ? Soul Wound: The Legacy of Native American Schools  http://www.amnestyusa.org/amnestynow/sou...    April, 2003, six members of the Sioux Nation filed a class-action lawsuit against the United States on behalf of hundreds of thousands of Native Americans mistreated in government-run boarding schools   ? Zephier, et al. (Sioux Nation). v. United States of America Complaint  http://www.twofrog.com/lawsuit.html    The same policy was carried out in Canada Up until 1989, Christian churches ran around 100 boarding schools for aboriginal children. Like the United States,,,,,,, documents show a death rate of 50%. Reportedly, more than 50,000 children died in these schools.    ? A 2001 report by the Truth Commission into Genocide in Canada   "The report says church officials killed children by beating, poisoning, electric shock, starvation, prolonged exposure to sub-zero cold while naked, and medical experimentation, including the removal of organs and radiation exposure  http://dutroux.blogspot.com/2008/02/rape...    In 1978 The Indian Child Welfare Act, passed to prevent the state and county welfare agencies from stealing the children and placing them in in nonIndian homes. Today there is still legislations that prevents Native Americans from protecting the children.  American Indian Child Welfare Act  http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/labriola...  -------------    Thousands of Native American men and women were sterilized right up to the 1980s. Even though the investigations began in the late 1970s    ? A Look at the Indian Health Service Policy of Sterilization, 1972-1976   http://www.whale.to/b/england.html  ? A History of Governmentally Coerced Sterilization: The Plight of the Native American Woman   http://www.whale.to/b/define.html    The United States and Canada carry out the same policies in regard to their Native populations. Here is another example.    1928: Sexual Sterilization Act is passed in Alberta, allowing any inmate of a native residential school to be sterilized upon the approval of the school Principal.    1933: An identical Sexual Sterilization Act is passed in British Columbia. Two major sterilization centres are established, in which thousands of native men and women are sterilized by missionary doctors until the 1980s.  http://canadiangenocide.nativeweb.org/in...  ===================    Add to that:  ? Slavery 1400x to 1980  ? Experimentation on Native populations to present day.     - radiation, drugs, vaccines, etc.  ? Contamination and toxic waste dumps on reservations.  ? Police & military deployment against Native communities.  ? Governmental legislation & policies to eliminate the Native population.  The list just go on and on and on.  ================    This is what the youth say    Indigenous Holocaust 2008  http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=vmaSF2aIxZ...  .|`|jI85GYGoaa	Not sure of the relevance of the example you cite to the situation in the Middle East.    I put it to you that the rest of the Arab world is not exactly falling over itself to show support for the Palestinians/ Hammas cause.  Egypt - Syria - Iran - Kuwait not exactly countries without influence in the area etc are not even publicly condemning events in Gaza.    Why is that I wonder? Surely they would be the 1st to support radical fundamantalism?    Best Wishes|`|3yXhtBSxaa	Um, excuse me...    I am very sorry for the losses of life and harsh treatment the native tribes have endured here.  But YOU CANNOT compare it to the genocide my people have had to endure for many, many, many, many centuries.  And you cannot say the "guilt" felt by people who did not participate in these crimes is the reason we have an alliance with Israel.    The natives in this country have learned to live peacefully among the ancestors of those who have taken this land.  My mother is an Israeli and my father is a Greek Jew, my family had no part in the settling of this land. so give me a good reason why I should feel guilty.    I could go on about how my people have been treated when we Jews began immigrating here: such as how we were not allowed to find work because no one would hire us, or how they put restrictions on how many Jews could go to a certain university, or how zoning restrictions prohibited us from living in the good part of town, but I don't.  Because I have been fortunate enough not to experience that kind of pain.    I don't take too much offense when someone calls me a kike or a Christ Killer...and that happens more often than most people think in this day and age.    I'm not bitter.  And I am sure that there are some Natives who might be bitter, but they have learned to survive, as all of us who have the "taint" of being different has learned to survive.    Your ignorance is one of the problems we have in this world, and it would be ever-so nice if fools like you actually picked up a book and learned something instead of spewing your stupidity around like a disease.    I'm not even offended that YA doesn't recognize kike as a derogatory word!|`|rUNlmQG5aa	Sorry, charlie, we don't buy it for a minute, don't kid yourself.|`|u9g2Cl6Eaa	To answer your question, no.  It is an interesting analogy, one that I have thought about myself in the past, but the real reason for the level of support is the political lobbying done on behalf of Israel in the USA.

AA11570618	My guess is that 'big business' (especially big media) is behind the push for digital. It has nothing to do with providing viewers with higher-quality definition and clearer reception.  I'd guess it has a lot more to do with opening up the airwaves so that broadcasters have more channels so that they can continue to help dumb-down America by offering more cable channels, fewer quality programs, and additional advertising revenue streams.   69 million Americans who are without cable service, or who own older televisions sets, are being forced to buy 'converter boxes' in order to continue to get TV reception. Even if they only have to pay $10 for their converter box (after a $40 government coupon), that adds up to an astonishing $690,000,000.00 in converter box sales!! The companies that manufacture these converter boxes stand to make a fortune while American taxpayers subsidize all those purchases with $40 giveaways. I, for one, won't be sucked in; I'll simply stop watching television, and maybe find more productive things to do with my time.   -RKO-   01/29/09|`|EPqnB7Epaa	The $600 million wouldn't really be necessary if people were to plan properly.  We have had two years notice that this was going to happen.  A converter box costs about $60.00.  That means if folks who needed to set aside $4.00 per month (which ANYONE could do) actually did so there really wouldn't be a problem.  The bottom line is that we could have had ten years notice and there would still be a tiny minority complaining about it.  Now that is Common Sense in a nutshell.    Are you honestly telling me that there is a person in the United States who owns a television that couldn't have put FOUR DOLLARS aside per month for the last two years to purchase a converter?  Get real, nobody believes that nonsense.    The ignorance posted here is sometimes stunning....God forbid you folks ever own your own business.|`|FdQD8H3qaa	It was another brain child of Bush...

The thing that gets me is that it's $60 for the box and you still need rabbit ears for the dam box to work... If you ask me it was a way to make everyone worry about that and not focus on the really evil things that he was doing... you know make them stress about day to day things so he can bomb who he likes without it getting in the news!!|`|RRTDRSw1aa	Yeh, it is.|`|s3E3KfBsaa	Progress is good!

This is the next four years of your life, at least. Make sure you research and get as much information as you can before signing on. Once you sign on, there's no turning back.

It was also the first time the US raised the American flag in a foreign country. Yeah, "the shores of Tripoli"came from this. So, he killed gobs of them because he admired their religion? The first military statue was in honor of this fight and now sits at Annapolis. I think that revolution would be on their minds, don't you?

Especially releasing prisoners from Guantanamo during wartime to US Courts. It looks like it is so attorney's can make money representing them. What else could it be?|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	The founding fathers would not recognize this country say nothing of what is going on so much has changed.  HOW COULD THEY? Labor is not the sweat of men but machines.  Travel is not measured in days/week but hours and minutes.  No longer going to Europe by ship but plane would be asking a little much of them.  They would stagger at the national debt.  I don't believe they could or had reason to count that high.  Trust me, "a melting pot" was not a part of the vision.|`|IUXriZQJaa	No.  The founding fathers were Christians, all but 5 of them. Notably, those 5 are the only ones we hear much about, except when we hear unsubstantiated lies about Chaplain George Washington.  Thomas Jefferson demanded that the Public Schools in Washington DC use the Bible and Watt's Hymnal when he was superintendant there. Jefferson also commissioned missionaries to evangelize the indigenous people.  Basically, the farther we get from having good, Godly, Christian men in office, the farther down the road to insanity we shall descend.  God will not help us if we keep shutting Him out of our country's doings.  None of the founding fathers would have condoned globalism, pluralism or the so-called multi-culturalism, which is nothing but an effort to meld all cultures into one prefabricated, disingenuously' designed mockery of what cultures are and what they do.  "No king but Jesus" was a common battle cry.  "No entangling Alliances" was a dominant doctrine early on.  No negotiating with  terrorists . . . That led us into the Barbary wars, which resulted in our ships gaining safe passage through the mediterranean, free from the Islamofascist pirates on Libya's north coast.    Oh, and shall we mention natural-born citizens as presidents?|`|otYOxmnuaa	They'd be loading their muskets getting ready for target practice.|`|VWLCwLNMaa	The multiculturalism maybe, but definitely not the globalism.|`|rUNlmQG5aa	Hell no, by a long shot.

Revolution would be nice except for one thing- the thug culture in which we now reside- these are precisely the individuals I would elect to eliminate, even though I am no criminal myself and in fact rather loath guns in general.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Well I don't think they'd be all too glad to find out that we consider them such heroes, only to know almost nothing about them.      And the one who did know something about Thomas Jefferson got repeated thumbs down for it.  Thomas Jefferson was a Christian, but was quite critical of Christianity for a long time.  He eventually reconciled himself with it, but he was very critical of it for a long time.    And he was quite fond of Islam.  He even owned his own Qu'ran; Representative Keith Ellison used it for his swearing-in ceremony when he first got to Congress.|`|0Ad0SrEfaa	Morons like you are making Thomas Jefferson roll in his grave|`|e2tE6EI8aa	NO WAY....we have stomped all over what they worked so hard for....Im embarrassed at what we have become....|`|FjwdmI0oaa	you can hear them all rolling over!|`|2DICrKNraa	Well, if you knew your history you would know that our founding fathers disagreed over a lot of things.  So, the logical conclusion is that  they would disagree over what is "going on (in) this country now."|`|aTAUOI8caa	The Founding Fathers disagreed with each other all the time; and Thomas Jefferson was about as Liberal as it gets.        Thomas Jefferson was also rather critical of Christianity, but had an admiration for Islam; and that was true even after he had a couple of run-ins with what was radical Islam of the time (mostly pirates).        As far as how any of them would see what we have today, almost none of them would have liked it.  They disagreed on almost everything, but the one thing they did agree on is that we should never have messed with the internal affairs of any other nation.    So they'd have a problem with how we handle the Middle East, Cuba, China, Russia, Israel/Palestine.  They would have a problem with how we are number 1 in the world, especially considering that it was our interference in Japan's internal affairs that got us into World War II and eventually took us to the top spot.

Also, if you do get in you probably will not be able to accept a commission, especially if you have to have a security clearance.

I barely squeeked in.|`|UoAZLRG8aa	Moral Standards   The United States Military Services make every attempt to assess the moral quality of potential recruits, and several categories of moral offenses may preclude enlistment. This is primarily accomplished based on criminal record.   I should note here that there is no such thing as a "sealed record," or an "expunged record" as far as the military is concerned. The recruiting services have access to law enforcement and FBI investigative records, which -- quite often will list arrests in these categories.     Nobody has a right to serve in the United States Army. Federal law and Department of Defense directives give the military services significant leeway in determining who they want to accept for enlistment or commission.     An applicant's criminal and "moral" history plays a large role on whether or not they are eligible to join the United States Army. It's important to note here that federal law requires applicants to divulge ALL criminal history on recruiting applications, including expunged, sealed, or juvenile records. Additionally, in most states, such records are accessible to military investigators, regardless of what you have heard to the contrary.     The process begins with an interview by the Army Recruiter, asking the applicant about any records of arrest, charges, juvenile court adjudications, traffic violations, probation periods, dismissed or pending charges or convictions, including those which have been expunged or sealed. Providing false information, or withholding required information is a federal offense, and individuals may be tried by Federal, civilian, or Military Court.|`|AA10709853	it is doubtful you will be permitted to enlist.   you can almost guarantee you will NOT be getting a Commission.       anything stronger than  Marijuana is usually enough to kill all chances of enlistment.  the GTA just seals your fate.|`|gDSJpRvTaa	Gee another one...

Also keep in mind that just because they allow you to sign up for a job it doesn't mean that you will be able to get the Clearance for it.

gHLryouJaa	I'm right-wing because conservatism makes sense.  But to clarify, I'm a populist, NOT a neo-conservative.    TRUE Conservatism is nationalism, and defending our national interests.    Liberalism is the opposite.  Liberalism at its core is anti-American, hostile toward U.S. national interests.  Liberalism is hostile toward anything that would preserve the U.S. as we know and love it, and always looks to Europe for how the U.S. should determine law and policy, instead of looking to the Constitution and U.S. national interests.    True conservatism, in the tradition of Teddy Roosevelt and Calvin Coolidge, opposes unnecessary foreign entanglements, opposes free trade and globalization, and always asks what is best for the United States and its citizens.  As opposed to liberalism that has a contempt for the U.S. and its citizens, and slanderously labels any nationalism and preservation of our culture and traditions, and regards EVEN TEACHING of the  TRUE HISTORY of our nation and its heroes as bigoted, racist, and jingoistic.     Unfortunately, the neo-con wing of the Republican party has abandoned Republican principles and sold out to hold onto temporary power, that disappeared on January 20th.      Read WHERE THE RIGHT WENT WRONG by Pat Buchanan, for a clarification of what *real* Republicanism is.    John McCain, on the issues of amnesty for illegals and global free trade, is not a real Republican either.  I would be glad he lost, if the alternative were not ultra-socialist spend-us-into-oblivion Obama.   I hope we can survive the next 4 years.      Now that the neo-con influence on the GOP is gone, hopefully Republicans can return to true Republican principles, and pull this country out of the ditch that  presidents Bush Sr., Clinton and George W. have cumulatively put us in.    Regardless of my political affiliation, this has been a bipartisan failure.    And bipartisan economic treason.     Regarding the economy, it should scare you that while Bush, Bernanke, and Paulson are gone, Rep Barney Frank, Sen. Christopher Dodd, Sen Charles Schumer, and Barack Hussein Obama (up to his armpits in Fannie Mae payola and with a Fannie Mae executive on his V P selection committee) , are all *still*  in office, and more powerful than ever, continuing to make  HUGE bad decisions with what's left of our country.|`|KuWLNfYbaa	I am a staunch socialist and believe that governments must intervene to stop the rich getting richer at the detriment of the rest of society.If governments had raised interest rates when the housing market went into overdrive then this credit crunch and world economic slump wouldn't have occurred.Why let the banks determine rates,they are a business and want profit so don't make decisions in the public interest.The trouble is that we don't have a socialist party any more,New Labour is nothing more than a milder form of  Conservatism akin to liberalism.Keir Hardie would turn in his grave|`|g7M1DxFCaa	Hey Croxx, New Labour are even more right wing than Thatcher was, they certainly don't represent any left wing attitudes or bear any similarities to 'old Labour'|`|EPqnB7Epaa	Wrong about the economy?

The early ruling elites learned early on that they couldn't simply rule over us by brute force alone and therefore created theology and ideology to control our ideas and justify their position at the top of society.    For long periods, most people agree or go along with most of the ideology of our bosses. One person on here even likens capitalism to a 'law of nature'. That's why they are able to get people to fight their imperialist wars, despite the fact that one group of workers slaughtering another group of workers doesn't serve the interests of the working class as a whole.     However, every now and then large numbers reject these ideas and demand a different system...that's why we have revolutions.    The dominant ideas of any society are the ideas of the ruling class. The key is to recognise ourselves as a class and act in our own interests. If we don't then our planet will be destroyed in capitalism's' mad rush for ever increasing profits at the expense of everything else!    We need to create a different world!    http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/articl...|`|VfYvJypEaa	You're an idiot .|`|44AkhdRnaa	"We've already seen that right-wingers were wrong about the economy, wrong about war, and wrong about the environment"    I agree however new labour say they are not right wing.    new labour have ignored the problems of the UK and just have added to it.

He increased the size of government like a liberal. The republican  congress spent like liberals and was defeated in 2006 because of it. Conservative supply-side solutions have been abandoned by today's republicans, so you can't say what hasn't been tried has failed. Contrary to what most democrats believe, the reason the democrats are in charge is not because the American people woke up one day and realized left wing, democratic socialism is the better way to go, but because conservatives like me didn't show up to vote for the republicans. I was told to vote for McCain by the republican party's representatives in the media, because he was the "lesser of two evils." No. I'm not voting for evil. McCain wanted to continue on this trend of printing trillions of dollars of cash out of thin air to pay for bail outs, he wanted to saddle our industry with this asinine cap and trade system. Let Obama do that crap, and let the democrats take the blame for it when it fails, which it most certainly will.|`|t4YoOX1paa	I'm a right leaning conservative because those ideals are what made America great . And no sir your wrong, We have not seen that conservatives are wrong about the economy, And the reason I know this is because there have been no conservatives making significant decisions on the economy in quite some time , Most of the Republicans have been moderates, Not true right wing Ronald Reagan Republicans, Your not informed. And no were not wrong about the war, The war in Iraq although unpopular was a success . And no we don't ignore problems of society to benefit another, We just don't believe the answer to every problem is throwing money at it which is the typical approach of liberals . And is there a place at the global table for conservatism? Conservatism and conservatives such as Ronald Reagan are the reason we're a leader in the world having any place at the table to begin with . The truth of the matter is, 99%  of the carnage you see in this world such as Break down of families, Crime , Immorality and such ? Is a complete and direct result of liberalism sweeping our globe.

Rush Limbaugh said he wants Obama to fail because he knows what you obviously do not, And that is that socialist economic policies such as Obama's can't not jump start a capitalistic society . Taxing and spending your way to prosperity does not work . Japan tried it in the 90s and ended up in worse shape then they were before they did it .

You don't have a problem with Rush disagreeing with a president, But rather a black president ! And that's the real problem here.

(It's kind of implied by the worship.)    But I don't think most white males agree with him. After all, he hasn't substantively effected an election in at least 4 years.    Limbaugh is a Media Clown, whose job involves getting listeners. As a result, he can (and does) cross lines of appropriate behavior. Often, he simply waits for his listeners to defend him.    If it's any consolation, Limbaugh's time is really just about up. As I said before, his influence on public policy and elections has been waining, and the importance of AM radio is also fading. On top of that, he has proven to be almost entirely unable to attract an audience in new venues. He's failed in television three times (his own show, his replacement gig on Pat Sajak, and his controversial failure at ESPN), and no publishing company has offered him a third book contract.    On the other hand, he has been very successful, and will die a very rich man. No schadenfreude for us!

If I was him and you stole my Ipod, charges would be pressed.|`|AA11752525	Good idea if you want to face theft charge and criminal prosecution. You cannot enforce a civil debt through criminal means.    Have you heard of Small Claims Court? Properly sue your roommate. Get your judgement. In many jurisdictions you might eventually seek to enforce your judgment by placing a lien upon the ipod. At the very least you will hurt his credit.    Good luck.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	It's a difficult, but valid reason not to be able to afford something and then promise to pay you back. Stealing on the other hand, is deliberate and never a valid action. But you can ask him to give his iPod to you for collateral. Sign an agreement with him for him to pay you back by a certain time and include the iPod as collateral. If he doesn't pay you back, then sell the iPod to reclaim your money. If he doesn't agree to the iPod, you can take him to small claims court.|`|1939q5Tgaa	well just don't pay the last 250 of rent for that month. or you could take him to small claims court.|`|cc86004dad5cecb00082abddf292e245aa	Once u leave the place, u will never get anything back.. It's good idea to take away his ipod as collateral but dun inform him in advance , just leave a note where he can see later after u left.|`|6Gfz125Paa	No, you can't.  It would be considered theft.  You could, however, say that he needs to give you collateral or you will sue him.

3U1po4Ihaa	The money for WW2 came from taxes.  Our government before WW1 did not tax our income,( amazing), and once our government voted to do that, it has never been lifted.    16th amendment 1913  Before,  the losing country or countries were forced to pay the winning country over time for the cost of war and repair themselves.  WW1 left most of Europe in a horrible state and many countries countries couldn't pay or simply wouldn't pay. Ex Germany.      Infrastructure did very little for the economy, because roads and bridges are not products to be SOLD.  Money only gains in value when it circulates really well and really fast.  People don't build roads and then sell them for a profit; that's why it didn't work.  WW2 help the economy so much because American companies made "tanks" and then SOLD them to the American government; circulation of money works every time.|`|TxRRITveaa	WW2 got us out. People bought war bonds and sacrificed alot to get us through the war.

The war also helped a lot, as sad as that sounds. WWII employed those who usually weren't (old people, women, children) while the men were fighting. They worked hard to support the war efforts, thus stimulating the economy. Obama plans on creating more public works projects to employ people, especially when it comes to the improvement of the environment and technology.|`|mOgFDOa9aa	thats basically what Obama is trying to do with stimulus and gov't jobs|`|0s09peMQaa	I asked this before.. Here..     http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...
K64Oi3hwaa	First of all we need to build a giant fence and invest in new technology/more border patrol.  Second, we need to increase raids and send all criminals that are illegal aliens back to their country of origin.  Third.we need strict regulation to make sure that the children of illegal aliens do not receive social security or US birth certificate.  Fourth,we need states to implement laws that say that only US citizens and residents can go to public schools,use government benefits,etc.   Fifth,landlords should by law be obliged to confirm that the person they are renting to is legal in this country.  Sixth,companies suspected of hiring illegals should be raided and if caught in the act should be forced to pay heavy fines.    If the incentive to come here is done away with then they will not come.    Let me just throw this out there...our government should cooperate with the Mexican government to send in US troops to fight,bomb,kill,and capture drug cartels and human traffickers.    To counter what Nat below me said. Mexico has a lot to offer. It is the third largest exporter of oil(PetroMex) to the US after Canada and Russia. Nonetheless their governments are corrupt and most of mexico's wealth are in private swiss bank accounts of corrupt mexican presidents,politicians,and lobbyists.|`|gZJ1EQx5aa	Mexico as a country has little to offer in way of natural resources or trade and their government has been downright corrupt concerning the drug trade from South America to the Southern USA. That said, I see where you are coming from. I hate that the people there have to suffer as a direct result of their terrible government, but if I wasn't so sure that that very same government would take that money and use it for selfish or pointless things, I'd be more inclined to go with your plan.|`|Z7W6FRoSaa	Because our govt wanted the illegals to invade our country to lower our middle class standards, lower labor standards and wages and use up all of our welfare money to create antagonism between us and illegals as a distraction from our govt doing other illegal activities like bailing out the banks, etc.|`|O1Unx5RUaa	Mexico should be incorporated into the USA.   Finish what President Polk started|`|nxS7Yzydaa	Go USA Cody!|`|ayhDyb16aa	Ya sure id help em by building and electrified fence with a surrounding moat filled with crocodiles and an anti personnel mine field and an armed National Guardsmen every 50 feet. Should provide some relief from over population therefore easing the strain on the Mexican Government to provide social services to its own people.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	First, the direction has changed.  Many of the illegals are going back to Mexico because they can't find jobs here.      We should not help a country that will not help itself.  Mexico's government is corrupt and geared to suit the rich with no regard to the poor.  There is no commitment to education or advancement of the lower classes.  There is no welfare.  One of the biggest sources of income there is oil, which means they should have plenty of money to fix it themselves.  The other big moneymaker for Mexico is illegal drugs.  We send them something around 60 billion dollars a year of American money spent buying those drugs.  And almost all the illegals are sending American dollars back to Mexico as well.  We're already sending them a bunch of money.  Why should we send more?|`|uuHDQr1paa	Bottom line...there was nothing in it for the U.S.  The U.S.A. only helps nations that have something they want or fear.|`|bxji3S56aa	good question....you'd think our neighboring country would come first.|`|FdQD8H3qaa	the thing is that a lot of people ***** about all of the illegals coming across the border and how much it costs and blah blah blah... The truth is that it is in fact good for all of those states and for the country as a whole..  these people are taking jobs that Americans don't want because A, they think that they don't pay well enough.... news flash if you are in high school and think that you should be getting $10+/hr then you are crazy...  B, they would rather sit on their butts and collect welfare  C, want to blame someone else for being a lazy *** and why not blame the people that aren't from here.... news flash! this was the natives land before there was the little invisible line called a border all of the brown people be it Native American or Mexican were the natives to North America not those of European or any other country's decent.    A lot of the illegals I know work really had at crappy jobs so that they have a better life for them and their families.. Most of them don't file tax claims even thought they are taken out of their pay checks because they are scared that if they do they will be rounded up and shipped out without notice  so in fact the country is making loads of money off of their hard work.  A lot of people I know say that they would have gone back to Mexico long ago if it hadn't been so hard to get here....  People say that they need to do it the legal way but the government has a quota about how many people they will let in from each country and it is crazy low for Mexico and cost a lot of money...     The bottom line is the situation will never change because the government isn't going to put millions of dollars into getting the people to come when they will come for free and make the government money in the process!!|`|5cc93dc15af56e8f47884e200463a48eaa	"Why didn't we put so much money into helping out a neighboring country, instead of a country half way around the world?"    there's no oil in Mexico and establishing a military presence in Mexico would not help the US in the middle east.|`|i0vcEyJtaa	Because it's not our obligation to help out other countries. We need to take care of ourselves, and only ourselves. Besides, their politicians are very corrupt, that money would have gone straight to their pockets. I don't think we should send money to anybody, that's including Israel, Egypt, and the rest of the world.|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	We need to first stop the massive influx of illegal immigrants by putting up a HUGE fence and boosting border patrol.     Other than that, I think we should stop sending aid to other countries that can't get their stuff together, and focus in the poverty and other issues here in the United States.|`|aMkLPOOeaa	mexican workers send 25 billion $$ back to mexico every year instead of putting it back into our economy|`|637425337df7c9e767eafff511b43419aa	I see how that would make things better for Mexico, but the reason it has not happened is because of Mexico's unwillingness to take care of its drug problem meaning drug trafficking, corruption in its own government is the biggest part of that. Corruption goes from Government to it's army down to local police. When Mexico takes care of its drug cartels and all of the corruption then the USA would be willing to help them out more. Not to mention all of the money the USA has already sent to Mexico anyways..... Basically what you say sounds good on paper but making it actually happen is very unlikely.|`|qcLP5j8zaa	Bush granted (our money) money to the Mexican government to help their country, my guess is that the people never benefited, otherwise we would not have so many illegals.  It's crystal clear the illegals have contributed to our economical  woe, however, we will not hear that from the media.|`|4dLPiqlZaa	We do.  The better question is, why isn't it making the country better?  The people of the country make it, not the government (free countries that is). Those who come here want a better life like all of us do.  Why then can't they make their own country better????     Canada is our neighbor and they are not streaming over the border to get a better life.  There is no reason why they cannot make their country better for all of their citizens.  It is a mind set, culture and a way of living that they want to keep.  All of Mexico isn't poor, a lot of it is.  There are cities where the standard of living is better.  Ever take a cruise?  Where the cruise ship stops the tourists get off and spend money.  Good for the economy.  Good for the people.  There are options for making a better life.  You have to want it.      I have no problem with anyone comming to this country LEGALLY to make a better life, after all this is the "melting pot" country founded on immigration.  But, I do have a problem with those comming over here ILLEGALLY and getting things like free health care, welfare, schooling (in spanish), food stamps, free or low cost housing - all paid for by my tax dollars.  Things that make it hard for me to make ends meet, while they have to bear none of the burden or feel that there is any responsibility to this county.  While there are, and I know some, that are honest, hard working people, there are more that want this country to become "Mexico".  These want everything in spanish (not learning english), their customs, their ways of living, bring crime, drugs and gangs and generally don't care about anyone but themselves. Have you watched the news about Mexico lately?  It isn't safe to "go over the border" (tourists) anymore.  If they can't make it work in Mexico, what makes you think they can make it work here?  Do it legally, be responsible for yourself and your family, be honest, work and have a productive, and you are welcome, anyone.|`|T4C4r5sbaa	Don't worry about it.  The US, Canada, and Mexico will soon become one under the North American Union (an extension of the NAFTA trade agreement) and we will all have open borders and one currency between us.  If you dare to find the truth in this statement, then perform a google search on these keywords - AMERO, North American Union, death of the US dollar, Council of Foreign Relations, DAVOS 2009 Summit...    BTW, Just this week at the DAVOS 2009 summit, the remarks from both Russia and China give a hint to what is about to come.  Those remarks include Vladmir Putin suggesting that the world's reserve currency is not to be the US dollar any longer.    Think about that.|`|p5F2LtmNaa	Okay! I had my identification stolen by an illegal alien! I am still pissed off! I am also a Mexican-American. I do believe that we should do this;    (1) If you are not here in the U.S. legally, then you have absolutely no right to sue anybody here!    (2) Let the Border Patrol do their job!    (3) Per every illegal that we catch, Mexico coughs up one barrel of oil! Mexico has what we want.(Oil) We have what Mexico does NOT want. (their poor)     (4) End ALL free handouts to illegals! That includes Health Care! Free Bank loans of any kind! And welfare!    (5) End all anchor babies! Restructure, do away with the 14th amendment!     We need to start to helping ourselves before helping others!|`|YnlT7m8raa	How about we take care of our own problems before we start dicking around with everone else.|`|rcgVQVg6aa	You are not stating anything I disagree with except for the "Steady Rate" phrase.     Illegal immigration has taken a steep decline since our economy is down.    I can literally see it where I live.      Illegal immigration will always follow our economy.  When things are good, people from other countries like to take advantage of us.  When things are bad, they act like they don't know us.|`|xVRGz3Oaaa	Mexico is a corrupt Socialist nation. 80% of the military are on the take from the Drug Lords so noting will change.    We should enforce our Immigration Laws just as Mexico does--violate Mexico's Immigration law--go to jail-no questions ask.|`|AXqmo8rlaa	Here is another question.....why is an oil producing country like Mexico not doing more to help their own people and economy? Corruption, greed, systemic in their political system presents a poor example and recipient for more aid when it will just enrich the top politicians. This exists with  many of the countries the US provides aid too. No other country is as generous.|`|maBzn6v7aa	Mexican cartels are getting FILTHY RICH providing the illegal narcotics to the  1 drug consumer in the whole world. (the United States)    Because the U.S. continues the fraud that is the War on Drugs, these drugs remain illegal (which means they're very profitable if you can move them to where they are wanted).    Cartels do this. They now have as much power as the govt. This type of unstable society results in people leaving the home country for another country. Why not go north??    Don't forget: to move drugs you got to have guns, big guns (also illegal, thus also worth a fortune if you are willing to take the risk).|`|NGvYcbToaa	23 or 24 of Mexicos states are ran by drug gangs, , and the majority of them are near the US border. Mexico is on ther verge of collapse, which could be a scary unpredictable thing. We need to close our borders ASAP, but we all know that wont happen with Obama and pelosi.
KAKXZw0Qaa	Before Nixon most every one in my Family were  Republicans . My Mother was an elected judge under the Republican ticket . When I was a teenager back then I was nominated to be a page in the state house of Representatives by a Republican.   But when Nixon came along and radically changed the nature of the party in a negative self serving way . Instead of Fiscal conservative it became self serving ambition and greed . In stead of less government control there seems to be more government control under Republican rule now days .  Instead of going to church and living a Christian Love filled life Judgment entered and reared it's ugly head . Martin Luther King was a Republican . Yet I doubt he would recognize the party today .|`|mL1yi935aa	Yes.|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	Democrats don't give a rat's @ss about "bipartisanship" until the Republicans are in power, but you have the audacity to accuse conservatives to have a tendency toward attack and cynicism.      That's just great.  Really great.    EDIT: How can you so clearly and succinctly miss the point I made above?  Look, the Democrats crying for "bipartisanship" during the '90s when the Republicans took over Congress was nothing more than an organized attack.      To address your immediate need to make the Democrats seem so benevolent, let's use Tina Fey as an example.  Quotes she made on Saturday Night Live to be funny are being attributed to Sarah Palin instead, and it's not by accident.  It is by cool, collected media design.      And look at Former President Bush.  Democrats are still attacking him by the tens of thousands per day.|`|Q7ovix19aa	Hamilton was pretty bad.  So were many of the initial leaders. The terrible mud-slinging eventually caused Hamilton to be killed in a duel.    However I haven't seen anything before like the crap thrown at Bush.  I'm not sure who started it, but every spoiled and sheltered brat Democrat seems to have joined in on the eight year temper tantrum.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	Um, no.  Liberals are more likely to attack and be cynical than anyone I know.|`|159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	Nixon was a liberal.    Granted, he manipulated foreign policy very well, but he was still a liberal. He loved owning a big government. The wage and price freeze is evidence. I remember that my dad couldn't get a raise, and lots of new products showed up at the supermarket in order to avoid the lockdown.    Goldwater and Reagan were the only conservatives around at that time. And Nixon, like Rockefeller, disliked them intensely.    We should never confuse the term "Republican" with "Conservative."|`|DX9ImmRHaa	Look in the mirror.  What did the Dems do to Sarah Palin?    EDIT: No, Sarah Palin's qualifications were the footnote of the bombardment against her.  She was attacked personally, with insults being flung about her family life, her personality, and her parenting.  She was turned into a King of the Hill type cartoon character by the media, as opposed to an actual politician.    Of course the Democrats (like yourself) try to dull the nature of the hatred towards Palin by saying it was ONLY her qualifications that were met with met scrutiny.  HA HA HA.     Obama's staff sent a team of 30 journalists to Alaska the day she was announced as the Republican VP nominee JUST to dig up something on her.  Her kids' friends were harassed about town by reporters trying to get info on what life at home with the Palins was like, for Christ's sake.    So don't act like hitting below the belt is something that occurs only on the Right's watch.|`|A7qDWyTYaa	Yes, without a doubt. He also denied being a crook, but once the light of day was shown uoin his operation, we found out that candor was not one of his strong points--and he had to leave the office.    Since some of the charges that have been levied against members of the Bush administration are far worse that what Nixon did, I am afraid some of them may end up at a Federal Camp Cupcake washing other inmates socks before it is all said and done.|`|86bdee7210e024dfe5c8dc94b917c424aa	I guess that what the Democrats did to Judge Robert Bork in 1987 demonstrates that they learned from Nixon how to do it effectively.|`|Tp8M1IgRaa	Probably.      http://postpartisannews.com/

If you make him aware that you have been drinking or he has reason to believe you have, not only is he bound by law not to allow you to drive, he may arrest you for being drunk in public using the rationale that your judgment was impaired.|`|y0jL9n6Taa	He can ask any thing he wants.  But he's probably in jail by now.|`|u6ALw1gAaa	If he has to ask then he has had to many.  He should call a cab.|`|JDltTREfaa	Absolutely.

hJNwAHccaa	Honestly...as an Officer...you don't work on ANYTHING.      If you are chosing Signal Corps as your branch in the Army, you'll need to have a working base knowledge of networks, how they work, signal flow, and how to troubleshoot.  Your job in the Signal Corps could be anything.  If you are assigned to a non-Signal unit, you're basically a SIGO.  You are expected to be the subject matter expert...but I'll tell you...you won't.  That's why you have NCOs and Soldiers that, if you're good to them, will teach you what you need to know so you don't look stupid.    If you're in a Signal unit, you'll most likely be a Platoon Leader.  You mirror leader in the Enlisted side is your Platoon Sergeant.  Listen to when he/she has to say and learn from your troops.  Don't think that being an officer makes you "above" them.  YOU are the PVT of the Officer Corps.  If you play your cards right, Soldiers and NCOs will teach you about how Signal equipment works, how signal flow is maintained, how networks connect to each other and what happens when they have to troubleshoot a link.    You don't really need to study anything fancy.  I suggest taking Network + as a starter.  Most get into CCNA, MSCE, A+...just start off with Net +.  If you can comprehend that, then you'll be able to understand how we work.  It's more than just computers and internet.  Think on the broad spectrum of tactical satellite systems and atmospheric transmission equipment.
WR3JgCxPaa	Good question.
RWwNLEuMaa	You should probably consult both a tax professional and an immigration attorney.    May I presume that the US citizen is the worker and has the social security number? Filing joint will require the illegal alien to acquire a Taxpayer Identification Number. I would imagine such returns are flagged and reported to ICE but I don't know how much manpower they can assign to a case like this. Face it, they would still rather go after the criminal alien (committing rape and murder) than the one that is pretty much minding her own business.    You probably would get more back as their would be two people to claim a deduction that just the one.    I guess you have to balance getting a bigger return/smaller tax bill vs possibilities of slapping the ICE bull on the butt and having it turn around and gore you.|`|84a8c56763d68beb4ad1677de837b103aa	The IRS does not report to ICE.

70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	The strawman fallacy occurs when a statement misrepresents or invents an opponent's point of view in order to discredit it. It does not consist of stating an opponents position, but only stating it inaccurately.    The strawman argument is intended to give the appearance of successfully refuting the original argument, thus creating the impression that it has refuted a position that someone actually holds.    In essence, a strawman is constructed expressly for the purpose of knocking it down.    How this applies to the rest of your question, I'm not clear on that.

The interesting argument about being pro choice is that everyone has a choice...except the fetus whose life is about to end.

Kind of hypocritical isn't it?
fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	I don't think a woman who has an abortion should be put to death.  There goes your premise for your question.  And if you are making up questions to satisfy your curiosity about the meandering thinking of a fringe fanatic, then you need to re-think just where YOU are on this complex issue.   That being said, there is nothing left in your rant to respond to. You seem much more interested in the act of coercing sexual activity within the parameters of a relationship than with the resulting pregnancy.

C)  On the strawman argument that it is "hypocritical" for pro-lifers to support execution of a convicted murderer, while simultaneously call for saving the life of a pre-natal child... the murderer is not innocent, and the unborn child IS innocent.      You kill a murderer to save lives, so that a tried and convicted murderer will never have the chance to murder again.     You save an unborn child because it is innocent of any crime.|`|WMqYhDNMaa	No, cos apparently you lose your right to life once you turn 18.|`|hexzaIGgaa	It seems like you could reap direct benefit from some of the stem cells that we cannot harvest because of people who "think" like you.    Anyway, just where are these babies that are commiting these murders anyway? You'd think that law enforcement would want to put a stop to that.|`|74c8b30f822cbd858ebede507e67269caa	No, I feel they are trapped and feel like there is no other choice. I am an odd pro-lifer. I feel that when a woman finds out she is pregnant, she should decide quickly if she feels she has no other choice and will not change her mind against abortion, she should do it early. I worked as an "abortion consultant" for an insurance company. All women had to be counseled before having an abortion under this insurance. My job was to attempt to change their mind. I saw women who were almost to term. It is legal until labor starts. I have seen a hysterotomy abortion. Where they remove the uterus with the baby and send the whole thing to pathology. By time it is "examined" they read it as uterus with baby in utero deceased. I had a baby at 30 weeks. 10 weeks premature. He had to be in a NICU for 33 days but he was very viable at birth. How can I possibly agree that aborting a baby is not murder. Saline abortions basically burn the baby to death since their skin is basically transparent and do not protect them from the injected chemical. I believe if death is the cesitation of heartbeat and brain function then the opposite is life and that is intact at 10 weeks. I believe most women know they are pregnant long before that. I believe the death penalty should be used for cold calculated murders. I believe most women who seek abortions do not really know what is happening to their baby, how developed it is and do not want to go through all that it takes to give it life and suffer emotionally with knowing you gave it up for adoption. They just want a medical proceedure that rids them of the problem. Out of sight out of mind.|`|1c74cc7ee9876780e94d288d920e0d0aaa	I am pro life, but don;t agree with killing women who get abortions.  What would be ideal is for them not to have to get them at all.  There is birth control, abstinence, The morning after pill, etc.  We are not some third world country with no resources.  I am also pro-death penalty however when you are sent to prison  for rape, murder, child sex crimes.  People can call it hypocrisy if they like but  there is a fine line that has to be drawn.    Can any of you here who say the death penalty is barbaric sit back and do nothing if you,god forbid had a child raped and murdered?  Would you feel sympathy for the person who did that to your child, your mother, your sister, your wife?  Would you not want justice?  Well I would, so call me a murderer.|`|YrW8QwVjaa	no|`|YHmr7nvsaa	The far right and the militant right to lifers aren't mentally stable.
YupMCYHlaa	You might remember that GHW Bush tried to abolish the food stamp program altogether, but he wasn't able to.  What stopped him was not the poor, powerless food stamp recipients but the big agribusiness and processed food manufacturers who made big profits off food stamps.  It made it clear that this is not so much a social program as a subsidy to food producers.    As a practical matter, if you're going to exclude whole categories of food, it could be difficult to define what's a junk food and what's a nutritious food.  If potato chips are excluded (not a bad idea) what about shoestring potatoes?  Frozen Tater Tots?  etc.  If soda pop is banned then what about fruit-juice based soda?  Energy drinks?  Fruit-flavored vitamin water?   If pastries are excluded then what about dinner rolls?  What about foreign cheese vs. US-made cheese?    It might come down to a product-by-product list, which would just be an incredible  hassle.  People will get stuck at checkouts where some items are allowable and some aren't, and they don't know until they're actually scanned at the checkout.  In some supermarkets maybe 20-30% of people are using food stamps, so it could get to be a real hassle.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	say what??   this is the way it was originally. Of course, it is reasonable. I don't know why they stopped. Food stamps were intended to insure that persons had FOOD to eat, hopefully nutritious food for kids.   Many govt programs have limitations, that isn't anything new.|`|f4doqdSCaa	I don't know where Obama stands on this.  Actually, I'm not sure what I think about it. On the one hand, it's obviously in everyone's best interest to purchase healthier foods over junk, and people who are on public assistance would certainly do better to remain healthy. Also it has been statistically shown that in times of economic crisis, that the obesity rate increases, due to the fact that 'bad' foods are often cheaper.  This leads to the other side of the coin. 'Junk' food tends to be less expensive, it's costly to eat healthy. If you're trying to feed a rather large family on food stamps, I'd imagine it's quite difficult. Of course, they aren't going to get very far on candy, soda and chips, but who are we to say that even they don't deserve a 'treat'?   And finally, wouldn't this action actually take away some freedoms?|`|fh12fkNWaa	No he shouldn't. We really don't need to set up the food police and having people reporting them like they were drunk drivers. Some states do have restrictions on buying some junk foods with food stamps, so be careful when you think the entire grocery order is all on food stamps. Watch sometimes they add cash to the stamps for the items not covered.|`|xtrdlyJHaa	He'll make sure Kool-Aid stays on the list.|`|vMG0CHmgaa	yeah they should. if ppl are getting free food why let them get fat off of it and then they need more food than last time|`|AA11378593	I really hope so. I was behind a lady at the store and she got chips, dip, mayonnaise, hot dog buns, cookies, a couple packs of pop, and more things that were already rung up and bagged before I got there, and I highly doubt she just happened to put all the healthy food on the line first. She then paid with a food stamp card and bought cigarettes on the side. Way to use our tax dollars on your junk, lady!|`|d92d9e4d19ffb819be90e8ef2b343f22aa	Food Stamps were set up to help people who are disadvantaged buy staples.  Soda and candy and chips, are most assuredly not staples they are considered junk food.  So if that is true and you need milk but get soda with the money? I think not.    When you are on subsidy this means you are on the tax payers bill, we pay those who are working for your food. As such? I think it would be better if you did not eat chips but carrots, and milk instead of soda. So for me? Yes I think it is a great thing to do, to monitor what is being  used and more importantly abused in the system.    I work so I can afford to choose what I want to purchase with the money I earn for a living.  So if I choose to get milk and soda, I don't have the government watching my food bill because I make the money.|`|85be78e04e9f820a7ce075e3e85248e8aa	i don't think that people should be banned from eating what they want to but if that's true i think that's what they would do|`|C8rRM4p5aa	In the state I live in  our state food stamp program already bans those items. I don't have a problem so much with chips, but pop,and candy ...come on. Make Kool-aid,and bake a cake...it's cheaper,and better for your kids anyway.|`|40zQThV1aa	I love that you asked this question! It's a hard one to answer without offending someone though. So in my humble opinion (climbs onto soap box)...      I think that it sounds reasonable to limit junk food from food stamp purchases. The reason I say this is because food stamps are meant for those with low income that would not otherwise be able to get the nutrition that they need. Junk food is not nutritious.    I do not think that it's politically right for tax money, or where ever else the government pulls the money from, to go to people buying fat sugar foods that will do more harm to a person's body than good. This also leads to the government shooting itself in the foot. For example...let's be honest, if you can't afford your own groceries, you most likely can't afford a doctor's visit, which is what you will need when you get cavities or become obese with diabetes from eating too much junk. Who do they expect to pay for medical then? The government of course.    I can also say, from my own experience working at a grocery store, that most, but not all, food stamps are used on junk food. In that case everyone might as well sign up for food stamps so that all of us can go into our favorite store and grab our favorite candy bar and soda during lunch break.     To me...something is very wrong with that picture.... Food stamps and government help is great, but let's not abuse the system!     I don't know if Obama will agree to it, but I sure hope he does!    p.s. I did say LIMIT junk food. Why don't they create a food stamp that is marked special for junk food (they can make a list stating which foods fall under that category) and only a certain small percentage of the food stamps go to treats? That way the majority of the food goes to healthier stuff, but they can still have a snack on occasion?|`|4TqERLSgaa	I was at the grocery store today. A woman who looked quite healthy to me, had two shopping carts full. She was buying steaks, shrimp, and all the good stuff she could never afford without food stamps. What is wrong with this picture? Yes she paid with food stamps, because the checker dropped the card, and I saw it. When I got home, my husband asked me if I bought steak for dinner. I told him no, we will have to go on food stamps to afford that. If they give you the food stamps, then yes they should be able to dictate what you can buy with them.

fAcVndo7aa	In New Jersey, your driver's license number is determined by your name and birthdate.  It's not uncommon for a number to be generated and issued even though you don't actually have a driver's license.  They use the same number for non-driver's identification cards and handicapped parking placards, for example.  My 6 year old niece has a medical issue, and her handicapped parking placard was issued with what would be (and will be) her driver's license number.

I know secret clearance goes back 5 years into you past so enlist 3 years into 11B and get some Small Unit Tactics experience out of the way so you'll have better chance at SF Selection.  non prior service has only 30% sucess rate.  Prior service infantry/ rangers have 70% if they finish SFAS.    Good luck!!|`|UoAZLRG8aa	Probably not.

That enlistment doesnt even guarantee you will make SF... it just means you get the school. If you dont make it through the school or selection (oh yes, you can make it all the way through SF school and get turned down because your peers dont like you) then you are just stuck being infantry anyway.  Your best bet if you really want to be SF is to enlist as 11B (infantry) and then talk to an SF recruiter later on and see about going to that school in a couple years. This way you can prove to the Army that you are reliable.

DTSUJe2oaa	Summary judgment is a legal term which means that a court has made a determination (a judgment) without a full trial. Such a judgment may be issued as to the merits of an entire case, or of specific issues in that case. The court could give a summary judgement upon the reading of the contract and consideration of the facts as presented by both sides, without knowing the facts presented it would be impossible to determine who would prevail,~|`|0cc280908f5890dc4f887659d66561b6aa	If there is enough evidence, admissions and the facts of the case is within the jurisdiction of the court, a summary judgment can be made by the court.|`|VjgqZetcaa	No, summary judgment requires that there be no material dispute of any essential element of the complaint or defense. Here, Jill has alleged fraud (which is a tort, outside of the contract) and Jack has alleged "mistake", which is an element of contract. This leaves not only a dispute of fact (he said, she said) but also a difference of applicable law, opening the door for further evidence, motions, or even a trial.    If the court is not convinced that the existing record clearly resolves the issues to favor one party or the other, then summary judgment is premature.    Jill's admission that she entered a contract is a legal red-herring, if she can be released from that contract because of her defense or because of the lack of mutual understanding. Jack's statement of Jill's misunderstanding is contradicted by Jill's assertion, thus leaving open issues of fact and truth.  If they were to mutually stipulate what was Jill's expectation upon entering the contract, what was Jack's intent in the contract and what was actually delivered, it may be possible for the court to determine the outcome on the pleadings.    If the court were to read Jack's defense as an admission that there was no "meeting of the minds", as necessary to form a contract, then it may be possible to rule on Summary Judgment in Jill's favor (making her belief there is a contract a mistake of law, which can be resolved by the court in her favor).

Because Indonesia does not allow dual citizenship, Obama thus loses his U.S. citizenship when he becomes an Indonesian citizen, in or about 1967. At this point Obama also ceases to be a Kenyan citizen, according to Indonesian and Kenyan law. Ann Dunham would have been required to renounce her U.S. citizenship, under Indonesian law, for her marriage to Lolo Soetoro to be considered legal in Indonesia. If, after Obama returned to Hawaii, he applied for and was granted American citizenship, he would be a naturalized citizen (like California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger) and not a natural-born citizen, and would therefore be ineligible to serve as President of the U.S. It is possible that Obama did not even bother to become a naturalized citizen of the United States, and remains an Indonesian citizen. Appropriate federal records would exist if Obama made application for naturalization; if they exist, they have not been made public. Indonesia still does not allow dual citizenship. Under Indonesia law, once Obama became a naturalized citizen by virtue of adoption, he could not lose that status without relinquishing his citizenship in writing, under oath. If he did that, the government of Indonesia would have those records. If he did not do so by age 21, Obama is to this day still an Indonesian citizen. If Obama became an Indonesian citizen, his place of birth or the nationality of his mother is irrelevant; Indonesian law takes precedence under The Master Nationality Rule of Article 4 of the Hague Convention on 1930. The United States accepts dual nationality only if the other country does; Indonesia does not. If Obama did not relinquish his Indonesian citizenship and become a naturalized U.S. citizen, he remains an Indonesian citizen, and has not been a U.S. citizen since being adopted by Lolo Soetoro in Indonesia in 1966 or 1967. Thus, he is ineligible to be President of the United States. (He is also ineligible to be a United States Senator.) Obamas repeated failure to provide documentation to prove he is a U.S. citizen suggests to many that it does not exist, and he is therefore possibly perpetrating a colossal fraud on the 300 million citizens of the United States. Obama may, in fact, be an illegal resident alien, subject to expulsion from the United States Senate, arrest, and deportation to Indonesia. Obama could also be subject to a massive class action fraud lawsuit by everyone who made donations to his campaign (over $600 million), under the mistaken belief that he was legally eligible to serve as President. Note that Indonesian passports expire every five years. If Obama became a citizen of Indonesia through adoption by Lolo Soetoro in 1967 and was then issued a passport, by 1982 he would need to again renew the document. Obama turned age 18 in 1979. If he renewed his Indonesian passport at any point after his 18th birthday, Obama would have officially lost U.S. citizenship - if he even still had it - according to 8 USC Sections 1481(a)(2) and 101(a)(1), because of taking an oath or making allegiance or other formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state after having attained the age of 18. It is unknown who financed Obamas costly, multinational 1981 trip. There are also allegations that Obama may have visited gay friends on the trip. Note that a trip to Pakistan in 1981 was not possible for Americans, except for those who were on official government business, because it was on the list of dangerous nations banned by the State Department for U.S. travelers. Pakistan was also under martial law at that time. It is possible that Obama was able to enter Pakistan on an Indonesian passport, but he would have had that document only if he was an Indonesian citizen; if he had become an Indonesian citizen, he was no longer an American citizen and his use of an American passport would have been illegal. Pakistan, being almost 100 per cent Muslim, would have welcomed foreign Muslim visitors in 1981. The U.S. State Department would not have known Obama was in Pakistan had he traveled on an Indonesian (or a Kenyan or British) passport Obamas school records from Occidental College have been kept secret. This may simply be to hide poor grades.

Mayport is the only Naval Station in FL. No one will be able to tell you what your chances of getting your choice of home port are until you actually get your orders. But, put them on your dream sheet anyway! Check out the link to see what ships are stationed at what home port.

Despite their supposed communistic failure, Russia still sees the West as a threat to their global intentions. Perhaps the latest example is their defiant invasion of Georgia.|`|ed8e2883b996a3685d6359a821a2d765aa	The West German state was not 'formed'.  It was what remained of Germany after Russia partitioned East Germany off after WW2.    NATO was a threat because its strongest member was the USA which was very much opposed to communism.|`|Ro03hVb6aa	In order to increase Soviet power, they wanted to increase the number of Soviet republics and keep those they had (look the USSR's actions whenever any of their puppet governments started acting like they wanted leave the soviet union in 1956 or 1968 for example).  The formation of NATO was a threat to that ambition.      It is very difficult for Russia to be a global power without directly occupying other countries as they have very poor sea access and, unlike the USA, cannot use a huge navy to coerce other countries by sailing carrier battle groups around.  Russia's only deep port open all year around is 11 times zones from Moscow, the others are all hemmed in by land or, just as bad, ice for large parts of the year.  To achieve the same global power, they needed a land empire and NATO stopped that expanding.    Their opposition to NATO expansion these days is slightly different but based in similar principles and I believe they would invade Ukraine if it tried to join.
9tcv3TiWaa	The military will not help in any way for you to sell your house that is your responsibility.  While you are in Basic your wife has to stay where she is, you will qualify for BAH - Housing allowance - based on your zip code there.  This is to pay for your rent/mortgage & utilities.   During AIT if it is longer than 22 weeks then you can get accompanied orders in which your wife can go with you, she will qualify for housing if there is any or she can live out in town.  The BAH will then be based on where she is at the time, which is where you are.  If the AIT is less than 22 weeks then it is unaccompanied so it continues to be based on your HOR zip code.  When you get your orders is where you will be finally moving to, it could be in the lower 48 (CONUS), it could be Alaska, it could be Korea, it could be Germany, no way to determine that now.      What you might want to do is find out how much your BAH will be now  by looking at http://perdiem.hqda.pentagon.mil/perdiem... (you are considered usually E4 and below) then you can determine if you should sell the house now and look at rental.  Consider how long it would take to sell your place and what your options really are.|`|AA10709853	no.   you are on your own in that regard.   Most people end up renting it out if they cannot sell.      you get housing allowance regardless.   where you would run into issues is what that allowance is based on.. it will be on HER location while you are in Training and on Unaccompanied orders.   it will be based on YOUR Zip code at all other times.      also Base housing has been privatized now so the BAH you get goes  right back out as an allotment.|`|w87icQkoaa	Try http://www.goarmy.com    That should help a lot more than army.com|`|hqJbghUUaa	air force offers this kind of stuff|`|51Ge1ffHaa	NWIP gave a great explanation, but I wanted to add my two cents.  My husband is in the Army, and we recently bought a house -- and then the Army moved us to Germany!  We handed our house over to a property manager to rent out, and the rent should cover the mortgage payment.  By the time we're done with the Army, the house should be practically paid off.  Just a suggestion.  :-)

bp59GQ0yaa	They cannot DEMAND it from you unless you are arrested.    If you do allow this for the purposes of eliminating you as a suspect then ensure that you get the samples deleted as soon as possible after they have discounted you as a suspect.  Get a written confirmation that they have destroyed them.  Ensure prior to giving the sample that they confirm they will be destroyed (I would get that in writing).      Those saying "if you have nothing to hide etc" should research the subject a little more before they blithely conform to this sort of thing.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with wanting to hide anything but rather ensuring that this insidious intrusion by government does not continue unchallenged.|`|zwctZ812aa	They have to have a warrant for your DNA, but you have nothing to hide, it might be worth it giving to them.  At least then they would get off your back.|`|ojHFFpcBaa	No. However, any DNA or fingerprints you put in the public domain, like those on a used cigarette butt or a water glass in the wash are fair game.

I mean you can ask the police what they will do with them and how long will they keep the prints for e.g if they destroy the prints at the conclusion of their investigation and the offender is caught then it seems fair they should have to assist their investigation. Most likely they are guessing its an inside job which frequently happens    However take not and refusal with the police will put you into strong suspicion. However you are still within your rights to say anything or give any sample you dont want to at this stage.|`|10541eb54f0b51e5e05e9e92b9882bbaaa	suspect!|`|fda66a3825ca9cdd945fd0f771540bddaa	They can't, but they are not asking you for them because they suspect you.  They are asking you because they know they need to eliminate the fingerprints and DNA of staff members in order to isolate those of possible suspects.  Your refusal alone is likely to be only a minor inconvenience for them, but if everyone refused then they can't do their job.|`|t0gChuAUaa	No.  They might be able to obtain a warrant, but until they do it's completely voluntary.|`|HOdisPCWaa	Yes they can if they arrest you for that offence, but if you are Innocent why not agree and help the police eliminate the innocent people so they get the culprits. The police have my DNA and finger prints and I have never been arrested.|`|de22c7d652b124696a6e263a4e7b0f66aa	QUOTE,  "Although the DNA database is a crime-fighting tool, producing around 3,000 matches a month with samples taken from crime scenes, around a third of all the DNA stored is taken from individuals who were not charged with any offence, and have no criminal record.  DNA records, which are taken regardless of whether a youngster has committed a crime or not, are held on file until the day they die.  In the past, police could take a DNA sample only from suspects who were charged with a criminal offence, and it was destroyed if they were subsequently cleared or a prosecution dropped.  But under reforms introduced in 2000 officers no longer have to erase innocent people's entries.  In 2004 police were given the power to take DNA swabs from anyone placed under arrest."|`|YHPYg7pWaa	It would appear that they are trying to eliminate as many people from the incident as possible.  If you and your colleagues refuse;It does send out a certain signal.

E.g. a DNA sample found in a drawer could be that of the drawer owner, not the offender. Unless you have the owner's DNA - how can you establish who the offender is ?    If you give it as a wtiness, it must be removed from the database when no longer required.|`|ypnWDDB8aa	do you have something to hide?|`|JA2Eq4Ypaa	No they can not, it is violationg your rights!|`|cGs9hkOKaa	Depends where you are from mate, but I'm pretty sure they can make you give finger prints or you will be charged with "obstruction of justice". Either way, its going to seem suspicious if you refuse to let them take your fingerprints, to them it means you have something to hide. If you know your innocent, give fingerprints and prove them wrong, but if you know you're not..............watch out.|`|AibeI0iCaa	no u don't have to but u mite loose your job and it would look a lot like your guilty of something.  you could make an agreement saying if anything is robbed then u would give your finger prints but not before!|`|NAAPpPduaa	they cannot demand to take your fingerprints; you may refuse.  they can only demand fingerprints if they arrest you for a crime|`|nahohzLHaa	they can if you have done something wrong or if they suspect you of doing something um like robbing a shop or something...  yeah so if that helps kwl|`|02v1YaI5aa	They asked for your PERMISSION to take your DNA and fingerprints.    You have a right to deny that permission.    However, if they can develop some proabable cause they could get a search warrant for your DNA and prints.  Then you would have to comply.|`|QRw8AhX7aa	Unless you are arrested you are under no obligation to give your fingerprints or a DNA swab. However the police may want your fingerprints to eliminate you from the investigation, they cannot then hold those prints on record - they have to destroy them. Problem is though, if you are even remotely suspected of wrong doing you can be arrested and have fingerprints and DNA sample taken, then even if released without charge the police will keep the prints and DNA sample which can then be used to check against crimes from the past ad any in the future. Good Luck|`|LxZ0tsjoaa	NO THEY CAN NOT AND IF THEY DO THERE VIOLATING YOUR RIGHTS AND YOU SUE THEM BUT WHY WOULDNT YOU JUST LET THEM UNLESS YOUR DOING THE ROBERIES ALSO YOU MUST BE A SUSPECT FOR THEM TO ASK YOU OUTTA ALL PEOPLE|`|OfUeh7AOaa	if they have interest in someone and have enough evidence they should be able to obtain search warrant for dna. hire an attorney!|`|bZNxLJFRaa	dont do it mate once theyve got ur dna its on there for life if ur unlucky 1 day ur fingerprints will appear on a crime scene n ur be number 1 suspect!lol!serioulsy dont bother just refuse!!!!|`|lmESBQb7aa	No, legally they cannot. They are violating your rights. They have no reason to believe you are the criminal without evidence. Then again, if I were you, I would do it if you really have nothing to hide.
EQCBK9PWaa	Worst case scenario: If the Police find the gun they will no doubt dust for prints and run any results through the national database. If your bro has previous and his prints are on the gun then they will come knocking.   What to do - co-operate fully and do not resist arrest or pull any more weapons for pity's sake. Police will want to know where the firearm was acquired, why and so on. Be prepared - get a good lawyer. Once again do not resist arrest - it could end up getting your bro killed as they will turn up with an armed unit.    Best case scenario - your bro's prints are of no use as he has no previous and they cannot link the gun to him in any other way so no knock on the door.   What to do - slap you bro really hard around the face and the next time he picks up a weapon of any sort you take him down the nick and hand the fucka in. Good luck!|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Well they can't book him because they have no reason to.|`|iBpi90l2aa	Call the police right now and turn your brother in before you end up in Federal pound-me-in-the-*** prison.|`|JemYTym5aa	uh, yah.  most places would try their best to find your brother.

Trust me on this.  I'm not one of those "barracks lawyers" that tell you sh!t because I think it's right...I KNOW it's right.  The same thing happened to a NCO I knew.  He had the same exact thing happen to him except for the fact he was already permanent party and in the Army for quite some time.  He was discharged from the Army and had an RE-4.  Usually with a RE-4, there's not chance of getting back in.  I went back home, took care of the kids, got full custody and put his life back in order for his family first.  After almost a year, he got remarried and decided that he wanted to come back to Active Duty.  He spoke to his local congressman about the incident and his explanation of the wrongful discharge.  His congressman wrote back to the unit, who happened to have the same company commander that discharged him, and asked for a rebuttal.  Apparently the rebuttal for the excuse of discharge was not sufficient enough and this NCO was reinstated back in to the Army.    I don't care...others can say I'm full of sh!t but I've seen it happen and I know it can happen.  I look at it like this.  If you were to speak to your local congressman about this, the worst that can happen is that you won't be able to come back in.  If you don't take the chance, you might regret it later if you really had hopes of ever serving your country.

Typically there's a reason why people don't want the police involved, it's because: (a) there's a warrant for your arrest and you don't want to go to jail. (b) You don't have any insurance. (c) You were at fault or engaged in some other type of criminal activity such as drinking and driving or possessing dope. I'm betting we're not getting the whole story here.

A range of guest speakers will be discussing nonviolent strategies and campaign tactics.    Handbook for Nonviolent Campaigns  Social change doesn't just happen. It's the result of the work of committed people striving for a world of justice and peace. This work gestates in groups or cells of activists, in discussions, in training sessions, in reflecting on previous experiences, in planning, in experimenting and in learning from others. Preparing ourselves for our work for social justice is key to its success.    On the 14th of February 2009 WRI will launch its latest publication the Handbook for Nonviolent Campaigns. This handbook shares what people have already developed in different contexts.    It includes sections on:    - developing strategic nonviolent campaigns  - preparing for effective nonviolent actions (complete with checklist)  - exercises for working in nonviolence (including group dynamics and gender issues)  - stories and strategies both showing the use of nonviolent organising tools in specific settings and describing global campaigns.    There is no definitive recipe for successful nonviolent actions and campaigns. This handbook, however, is a series of resources that can inspire and support your own work, especially if you adapt the resources to your own needs and context.    Programme  - Presentation of the Handbook for Nonviolent Campaigns by Javier Grate, Coordinator of the Nonviolence Programme of War Resisters' International  - Talk on Nonviolent Campaign Strategies by Howard Clark, Chair of War Resisters' International  - Discussion on what makes an effective nonviolent campaign  - Drinks and snacks    For ordering copies of Handbook for Nonviolent Campaigns, please contact the WRI office at info@wri-irg.org.|`|rTscI3Lwaa	lol sigs, oh dear. sorry mucker R.E.

I know some people, who are 'liberal' thinkers...who really try to be fair, but the majority are brainwashed these days, or so it appears|`|sJeR0kzUaa	Yes, this one seems a bit more mature than most others I've met though.|`|587533eca4604b2d23fa382dc6204d59aa	Once in a while they don't START that way but yes, EVERY discussion with a liberal will go there - right after you say something true.  Of course, you shouldn't test this by finding a liberal stronghold to try it in. In places they feel "safe," their FIRST resort is violence.
TsjqzanQaa	Disability varies from state to state, and also an individual case basis.    And anyone who is rude about Asperger Syndrome is an idiot.    People should be aware that autism has nothing to do with intelligence, and it's difficult for people with autism to interact with others.    You can apply for disability, and I recommend that you do so as soon as possible, as it takes a long time to get it, and even if you're turned down, when it's finally awarded, you can get money retroactively.    The best of luck to you.|`|AA10709853	if you are asking does the military offer you any support: the answer is NO.   you are on your own, your spouse's occupation has no bearing on social services you are entitled to through the State.  ADA will offer you some help/protection with regards to making REASONABLE accommodations such as providing a stepstool.       Frankly you are going to have to find some way to  get past the whole lack of social skills, because even the most solitary job in the universe STILL requires you to interact with other people.|`|DQkDQraOaa	Getting disability has nothing to do with your husband being in the military. These are two separate issues.    I would visit your nearest SSI office, or at the very least call them. They can give you the specifics of what you will need to file for disability. Your doctor will be asked to fill out forms stating your condition and that your are disabled. Some people end up hiring an attorney to assist them in this process, especially if you get turned down.    EDIT:  You want to go to college and get an engineering degree and then be an engineer? All of this after being declared totally DISABLED and unable to work?????     So which is it? Are you totally disabled or not??????????    EDIT:  You know, I was right with you until you edited and added that part about being an engineer. It all fell apart after that.    As for your dwarfism being a hindrance in the work force, I assume that your dwarfism was obvious to the employer when he hired you. So I'm sure that he would provide you a stool to "reach" things. He wouldn't hire you if he didn't think you could get the job done.    Besides, I thought it was your lack of confidence that didn't allow you to work. How would that change when you became an engineer?|`|433571011989f7699b6947635139e845aa	Disability payments are actually part of Social Security.  It is generally based on income more than impact of the disability and in all honesty even lower ranked enlisted often make just enough not to qualify.  They look at the income of the household, not just the individual, so yes your husband's military pay and some benefits will be taken into consideration.  Additionally, it can be extremely tough to get for anyone on the spectrum, especially the "milder" end which is where Asperger's is generally considered to be.  That being said, the only thing you can do is try.  Go to the Social Security website and click on the links to get info about SSI.  It will explain the process to apply and you can even download the initial paperwork from there.  It is not a quick process and it will be reveiwed every year (so if you did end up finding and keeping a job, you would most likely loose the SSI).  I also suggest you contact the local branch of the ARC as well as any autism support groups in the area.  Adults with Aspergers can have a tough time in the work place if they don't have the needed support or any of the transitional training.  Since communication skills are key in every work place, it is definitely an area that you will need help in.  These orginizations should be able to provide you with support as well as help you find programs in your state.  And finally, consider working with a therapist experienced in working with adults on the spectrum.  Tricare has outstanding benefits when it comes to therapy...you simply need to find a Tricare affiliated therapist through the Tricare website.  A therapist can help you identify what behaviors may need to be worked on and how to adapt.  Use all the tools at your disposal.  Good luck.

rKY8Cjmxaa	This just gets my wheels turning. Time limitation statutes be damned, full speed ahead! The Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act sets a dangerous precedent by allowing anyone receiving a check, including pensioners, to sue. Concevably, a woman in her 90s could sue a company she began working for when she was 15 yrs old, 75 years ago, if she still gets a pension check. This could certainly be defined as "change" coming from the new government. I wonder if this is just the first move in that new direction? Could this be the beginnings of no time limitations of any kind in civil matters?     If it goes that far, I'm going to have to quit working and hire a full time attorney. This is what he'll be doing for starters:    1. Five decades ago a doctor, while working at a prominent hospital located in my home town removed my tonsils, thereby severely hindering my ability to ward off the common cold. I can see some punitive damages due here.    2. Exactly five decades ago another doctor in the same hospital used his scalpel to cut into my eardrums to insert draining tubes. Today, my hearing is failing, due in part to the scar tissue on my eardrums.    3. I'm certain that the generally stiffness and soreness my back today is due to that city-owned vehicle that rear ended me three decades ago. After all, that was the seminal moment for stiffness in my back. Wonder how much that would be worth?     4. Two decades ago I spilled hot coffee on my lap at a fast food drive-through. No one warned me the hot coffee was hot! Stella Liebeck received 2.7 million in a case like this from a McDonald's in New Mexico. What could I get? Who's going to remember the incident other than myself? How could the defense attorney possibly bring any witnesses? Maybe I could get even more than 2.7 mil?    Getting back to the Ledbetter Act, I'm sure that retired and working women everywhere are celebrating today, but so are the attorneys. Talk about shooting ducks in a barrel!     I hope the first judge that graples with this new law strikes it down, and every judge after!|`|587533eca4604b2d23fa382dc6204d59aa	Yet another Democrat bill NAMED with a lie.  As you described, it is actually the "go back in time and sue" bill. It allows lawsuits that CANNOT be defended because the people allegedly responsible for the claimed discrimination are DEAD.  There is a 100% chance that 100% of such claims, even overtly imaginary ones, will be winners since the plaintiff's story automatically gets accepted as fact.

And time for everyone else just to kiss their A** goodbye to the big government programs that Hussein Obama wants......Didn't you notice in his inauguration speech he stated he wanted to "rebuild" America?

c5a80b54427d403df08bd924a7e11fc6aa	Its because all of us yankees are going to have to flee our liberal states that are taxing us to death.  The bad news is that the liberals that ruined the north are going to eventually move south and ruin your states too.|`|bd035cd5fbed641889c4230d224d60d3aa	LOL! Are you serious. When you say the South will rise again, what exactly does that mean? You want to live on a plantation and have slaves to pick your cotton? That was the heyday, right? The North was always the industrial capital. Guys like you have been talking about this crap for over 100 years. If it was up to me we'd let you secede from the union. Less racism you say? In the back woods of Mississippi, a black man is still expected to step off the sidewalk when a white walks down the street. Try that in Ohio! Less than 5 years ago, I was in a mom & pop convenience store in a small town in Louisiana and the clerk told a customer "****** go get me some coffee" and he did. I was shocked! That doesn't go on in Rhode Island, buddy. I'll give you that it doesn't happen in Atlanta or Jackson, but it definitely goes on in the south. It doesn't happen in small town in the North. Not that I've ever seen. I'm not saying that there aren't racists in the North, but it is nothing like what you can experience south of the Mason-Dixon line! Get a grip, for real!    EDIT: I did read your whole question. It clearly states that you believe there is less racism in the south than the north. You saying "not racism" at the very end does not negate that.      Just curious, are you sending insulting emails to everyone that sees your viewpoint as ignorant, or just me. And as far as my education, I'm afraid you missed the mark, yet again. I do have an education, and am a medical professional.|`|5rQnJZ8uaa	Your question is unclear we are one nation and we rise and fall together the only way the south "rose" its claim to fame was succession from the union and its insistence on slavery,  any prosperity it achieved was on the backs of the black people your question is indicative of why race relations still has along way to go in a true age of freedom your question would not even be asked.  Get your local state and Federal representative to work on education, standard of living and jobs for all and the south would have a meteoric rebirth|`|BVaCJkxzaa	Because so many people think the history of the south is all about the slaves and nothing else. They have not a clue of history.|`|otKIUViRaa	Some of your statement holds truth because of less taxes companies have moved south.

I am a southern and I have southern pride. It makes me proud to see others like myself not afraid to show it! Good Luck and God Bless!|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Sounds like a good porno    So what you're saying is that you folk need another general Sherman to put you back in your place.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	Usually when people say the South will rise again, people have visions of the antebellum South with slaves and plantations.  Since you say the South has already risen back up, why do guys like you keep saying the South will rise again?  That seems like a pretty stupid thing to say, now doesn't it?  Unless you're saying it because you would prefer to have your slaves back.    Think before you type, man. DUH.    Btw, I lived down South for quite a long time, and I saw a lot more racism down there than I've seen up here.|`|8PCriC7Vaa	I moved from the north down to Florida, and believe me, there is nothing rising down here.

Cereal is a breakfast food. And no, you can not be charged with a crime, as long as you had no role in the crime itself.     In order to aid and abet another to commit a crime it is necessary that a defendant in some sort associate himself with the venture, that he participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about, that he seek by his action to make it succeed.|`|fQgbBx7caa	Depends on the cereal....was it frosted or not?

However, when I presented him with the catalogue of America's global intervention in numerous coups and assisting dictators hold onto power..e.g Indonesia, Chile, Cambodia, Venezualia etc etc, he replied; "You could be making all this up.

What's that tell you ? Yes many of them are dumb. But something else to consider,  The French are arrogant , stuffy and have disliked Americans for quite sometime, The French are also very liberal and liberals tend to worship education and knowledge while giving integrity and character a back seat to it.

As our population grows, idiots multiply faster than fleas and smart people usually plan to avoid "accidents".  So, unfortunately, yes there are more dumb people nowadays.. But, there are also more highly intelligent people now than 20 years ago. Just not as many because so many think with their smaller head. Just watch, though.

It coincides with the cultural war on personal responsibility and values that promote decency and hard work. The media and pop culture have systematically eroded the need to think things through by replacing common sense with emotionally charged and distorted misinformation. Leftist propaganda has so permeated what we watch and hear, and we have become mentally lazy and complacent as a result. This is because the main agenda for them is to "dumb-down" the public, first eroding values that reinforce families, on to selling them the idea that the "rich" are the source of the worlds problems, etc. People are so confused now, they don't bother to investigate what they are told. They accept things at face value, and look like fools for doing so...i.e. the typical Obama voter.|`|587533eca4604b2d23fa382dc6204d59aa	I empirically KNOW they are.  That's what public school is for. Mission accomplished.  No, I'm NOT kidding or being sarcastic. I did exhaustive research on "The Social Foundations of American Public Education." Trust me - it's PURPOSE it to turn-out generations of STUPID fascists. Why do you think schools are never "fixed?" Be honest and if you can't remember, dig-up old news stories. Public school "improvement" NEVER involves meaningfully changing ANYTHING about content or method. It's always - "more money" but ONLY for schools that KEEP failing. So why aren't they "fixed?" Because they're WORKING. If you think our system is broken, you simply don't know what its for.|`|KsNL5Nhoaa	Methods for totally controlling our society.    Keep the public ignorant    This is achieved by:  disengaging their minds; sabotaging their mental activities; providing a low-quality program of public education  in mathematics, logic, systems design and economics; and discouraging technical creativity.   engaging their emotions, increasing their self-indulgence and their indulgence in emotional and physical activities, by:   unrelenting emotional affrontations and attacks (mental and emotional rape) by way of constant barrage of sex,  violence, and wars in the media - especially the T.V. and the newspapers.   giving them what they desire - in excess - "junk food for thought"  - and depriving them of what they really need.     Media: Keep the adult public attention diverted away from the real social issues, and captivated by matters of no real importance.   Schools: Keep the young public ignorant of real mathematics, real economics, real law, and real history.     Entertainment: Keep the public entertainment below a sixth-grade level.|`|cIsKa7Hiaa	I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THEY ARE NOT DUMB BUT IGNORANT.

Ever note how all the govt employees, teachers do not have to "share the pain".  They get their nogoited raises, pensions health care no matter wht happens to the paying taxpayer.  When we have a fair taxation policy at all levels, and gvt operate with the absolute least amount of money necessary, then you will have ral growth.  Govt has never once gotten us out of a recession, private business activity always has, this is something Obama and the dems refuse to ever admit.  I wonder how much more proof the need.|`|gJzEAvNTaa	what are u complaining about?  this is democracy  the majority have spoken, and they wanted to vote obama  if you got a problem, don't fix it right away  wait 4 years    also i agree  we need to close down all those chinese restaurants  they're making us all fat with that oily garbage  once they're all gone,   americans will be skinny and fit once again|`|h8OnlTjQaa	Calm Down it's not the end of the world dude|`|nzdDdKtyaa	The government can't solve these problems by throwing money in people's faces.    The way I see it, the whole process of government spending, as well as tax rates, needs to be completely overhauled.  There are so many billions of dollars being spent on unnecessary things right now, if they just do what is necessary(for a few years at least) they can lower taxes a good bit.  The U.S. government is a business just like anything else: It has its income(taxes) and its expenditures(government spending). If it lowers its expenditures, it can also lower its income. Lower the spending, lower the taxes.

No economic system can continue an ever increasing disparity of wealth without eventual collapse.  Simply put, a wealthy 1% either cannot or will not maintain the same demand as the other 99%.  So when wealth accumulates with 1% of the population, it eventually drives down demand to a point where there's an over abundance of supply.  At which point, production must decrease, which lays off not the 1%, but part of the 99%.  Which decreases demand further and starts a downward spiral of economic collapse.    Thus, in any society where wealth accumulates among a few, one or two things will happen.  Either there will be a redistribution of that wealth, or there will be an economic collapse.  It is possible to have a collapse and then redistribution.  But either way, there will be redistribution or the system itself will never recover.    Now I realize this is a giant blind spot for those "pure" capitalists out there.  But historical events over the last 7000 years has proved my words repeatedly - every time.  The truth of this is irrefutable no matter how much one wants to deny it.|`|c9c21b842bc0967b25ee1f5620157edfaa	When it hits the bottom.|`|BquqToGaaa	In 2012, when the world blows up.|`|whE5OQ26aa	Start watching Mad Max and taking notes.|`|18167e6cb8bb213b37ad670e7870b7fdaa	The minute you're in your grave we're going to throw a big party.|`|cjNtjOZtaa	Be glad you don't live in Britain we are destined for third world status . - US will be fine it's big enough to get by it may take a while but things will slowly improve|`|t0gChuAUaa	The sky is falling!

ydRx3dAtaa	Probably not at the same time.  Being an Air Force Pilot is a very demanding career in itself.  It's constant drills and keeping up with required flight hours.  Studying medicine is a full time job.  You can go to the Air Force Academy and serve in the Air Force and they may even pay for you to go to medical school.  Trying to be both would put one under more stress than one person can handle.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	Unless you are thinking of being in the Reserves then you would find it nearly impossible to do both. The AF will invest a great deal of time and money training you to be a pilot and (almost) expects to get 20 years of service out of you. You will be a member of the profession of arms. Emphasis on being a professional. You will not have time to dally with other fields of study.

When I applied to my force 5 years ago there were 100 applicants for every job. With unemployment rising this will become even more competitive. So I would say far from being 50-60% it will be less than 1%.

70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	You were married in what is called a, "civil ceremony." This is as legally binding as any other type of ceremony. You will still need to go through the divorce process, file in the same county.    You MUST have a license prior to marriage in every state that I know of. The document that you later receive in the mail is your marriage, "certificate." The license is what makes the marriage legal and binding, I'm thinking you might be confused between the two. You need to find out for sure exactly where you stand though. Contact the Court Clerk at that same courthouse in Santa Ana or the Dept. of Records/Vital Statistics.|`|c9c21b842bc0967b25ee1f5620157edfaa	Sure, I agree.|`|e7513149c6dfdc3ee07fc2d68f1e176daa	If you got a marriage license, the rest is unlikely to matter.  Filing for divorce in California, particularly if you've been separated for a while, is pretty easy.  Trying for an annulment instead (which is what you'd be seeking) would probably end up being more expensive and difficult, and not worth it unless there's lots of community property involved.|`|c8672da7ef4d6901656bd2ee445c88a0aa	If it was at the courthouse I'm sure it must have been binding.

Before recent events, my answer would of have been YES, but since the bailouts have started it has brought home to me, just how the working people end up paying for everything. I am a member of this working class and I am upset over what our government has allowed to happen and their solution to the problem. I don't think taxpayers should have to 'fix' everything. And robbing banks would cost the taxpayers. So no, at this point, now that I truely understand the cost, my answer to robbing a bank is a loud :NO.  Murder: HELL NO, NEVER. Even if we have someone we would like to see dead, to murder them is wrong. You are also hurting innocent people if you do that because everyone is loved by someone, and that someone doesn't deserve to be hurt becasue of me and my feelings or actions. No, murder is not a option and has never been a option for me.
