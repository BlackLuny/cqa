They might also have one that was ordered and no one picked it up.   Also look at the newspaper in misc. sales or the music sales and the second hand shops.  Hope these help.

KlkUj6uFaa	Whether your crush is going or not isn't important because if something that is meant to be fun is causing you to feel so sick then it isn't worth doing. Everyone gets anxiety from time to time, but maybe research this because you might want to see someone about it to help you.|`|CjsFtjuhaa	Don't worry, you won't embarrass yourself.  I'm scared of roller coasters as well, and I just breathe in and out and imagine myself having a great time.  Later, the ride ends up not being as bad as I thought.  My thoughts about what "could" happen on the ride were taking over, and it scared me more.    You don't have to go on all the rides, maybe you want to start off small and work your way up - go ahead!  Or, try new things!  You'll be surprised at how brave you were to go on that ride with the big loop and drop.      If you end up not liking the ride, that's okay.  You could just be glad that you tried.|`|Ot2AERbcaa	dont go or just take slow deep breaths dont go on the rides if you have to it might help if we knew if you get motion sickness.  just take pills to make you not puke.  good luck(:  & if he truley likes you then he will not be wierd about it|`|BTtvG2r8aa	six flags is great, you'll be having too much fun to be anxious about anything, you don't need to go on any rides if you don't want to.  Just remember to take deep breaths in through your nose and out of your mouth and visualise yourself being relaxed.|`|lrBC1dxqaa	Everyone has something in particular that makes them want to throw up hun, it's okay. It isn't anything to be embarrassed about at all. You can get anti-nausea meds from your doctor or over the counter at the drug store. Some of them will make you sleepy so make sure to try to get some with the least amount of sleepy side effects! Also get a baggie of ginger snaps to keep with you and when you drink soda, try to make it ginger ale. Ginger has a natural nausea relief/prevention ingredient that will help soothe a tummy!|`|MMpKdxvLaa	Don't fuss over it. Six Flags won't kill you. Just give it a shot and besides, you're going with your crush so have a great time.|`|yxoXTmlqaa	Listening to music on the way there is a good idea.  Also, try not to look at it as you approach it, that'll rattle your nerves.|`|Q2HmWDURaa	dont go.....pls................................. calm down.......................................|`|pLCLtbtFaa	It's okay. :] Don't freak out.

58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	check out this site for some great inspirations http://www.venetianmasksociety.com/   I'm a mask maker but I make mine out of leather,like traditional venetian mask makers,  which may be kind of difficult if you've never done it before. I suggest going to a craft store and buying one of those cheap plastic mask forms. You can cover it with ribbon, fabric, pretty paper, jewels, feathers or paint. OR you can use the form to make your own from scratch with paper mache. You can cut shapes like wings, horns, eyebrows, etc out of cardboard or cardstock and glue them to your mask to make it more elaborate. On my masks, I also use wire, beads, trim and ribbon. You can also add fake eyelashes or hair. You can use a hot glue gun to attach your decorations. Good luck!

oc5h6B5oaa	Go get a ZyXEL P-330w.  Its an inexpensive router that you can set up as a wifi bridge. Basically turning it into a wifi adapter that you can connect with your 360 over ethernet, while it connects to your main router over wifi.  Its cheaper than some wifi usb adapters.|`|i2zF8RlAaa	Nope, but you could get a long Ethernet cable. A bunch of 50 foot Ethernet cables from Amazon are on sale for like $5-$10 (original $15-$30), and if you worry that it'll get in the way, then you could buy a few mounting clips (pretty cheap, few bucks for like 6) to mount it on the corner of the ceiling or something (If you put it in the middle of the ceiling it might make it look kind of ugly so try and put it in the corner). Good luck with that. =)|`|9y1uYUm3aa	i dont think so|`|0PX29iC0aa	no|`|Mb31azhQaa	get a wireless router, yet itll be expensive cuz u gotta get wireless adapter which runs u $100, so good luck with that

6N3yjlXhaa	Hobby Lobby has McCall's patterns on sale this week for $1.99.  Look through the pattern catalog and you should find something you like.    If you have never bought a pattern before - go by your true measurements and not your RTW (ready to wear) size. The sizes will be on the back of the pattern envelope.    When you find a style that you like, you will find the pattern in the filing cabinet near the catalogs - they go by the pattern number.    Have fun - sleeves are a lot easier to do now (not so when I was in Jr Hi).

I suggest you save your money and buy your own Webkinz.  That will mean more to you than someone just giving you a code.
ysiE6IDjaa	I think you have to go to flooring then 'other' in the catalog. You will see things like graveltar and the sand-type flooring. I definitely have a lot that has the sand type stuff as the roof and it is weather-proof.    Edit: I double-checked this in my game when I got home from work. The floors that work as roof tiles are under 'flooring' then 'miscellaneous'. You will see for example Graveltar that says in its description ' spread tar, spread gravel, get roof'. 'Sand' works the same way, and I think all the others under miscellaneous would probably work as roofs too.    Hi S2P! I will check my email when I get some privacy. :)|`|Dso7k3sjaa	I'm pretty certain that the roofs on the houses that Don Lothario and the two sisters live in in the Pleasantview neighborhood are "weather" proof.  I mean, I played Don in his house after I put Seasons in and he never complained about weather coming into his house that I remember anyway.  Maybe you should play him in his house for a little while, as the Seasons change to see what happens when you play him.    Hi WB!  Hey, I sent an email to you.  :-)|`|JUWzOTTiaa	That's bizarre. i have several lots, both residential and commercial, where I use the flat roofs. i have also made my own custom flat roofs using both the floor tiles from the game and custom floor tiles. i have never had a problem with the snow or rain coming in. Are you sure every bit of open roof is covered?

If he bought it with your money(aka allowance, etc.)? See above  If he bought it with his own money? No. It's his possesion, and although you have total control over him it is still wrong.    Make sure he knows that it's not his fault, and if he wants to play it try to make compromise with him.    No offense if your child is female, easier to type him.|`|p7wnI6Jxaa	Your gonna make the poor child sad because of your problems?? No, it would be right.

127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	You did not list a date, so all people here can do is guess. If the date is 1943 then it is indeed is a zinc coated steel cent. However on the reverse are 2 wheat ears and between them it says "one cent" and below that "United States Of America", the word currency is not there, for the term stands for paper money and is seldom used when coins are involved. If the cent dates other than 1943 then it was silver plated out side the mint and it is considered a damaged coin.|`|d571eacbe97bbafd0175215413966c9faa	Depending what year it is.  There were some silver pennies minted a long time ago, I don't remember the year.  Also depending on what grade you are in, my daughter (8th grade) in science this year, and just recently, were doing a chemistry experiment and changed copper pennies to silver and gold (toned anyway) with chemicals. She brought them home.  Someone at your school might be doing the same type of experiment and dropped one that they changed.  The "one cent" logo was used up until the late 1950's, then changed to the Lincoln Memorial|`|39DseBkiaa	If your penny has a 1943 on it and it is copper to know if it is copper use a magnet if it sticks to it its not copper but if it doesn't it is copper it is about $200,000 or more worth for that only penny if you do have it lucky for you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ZuLY2e6aaa	You may have a zinc-coated steel penny.  These were made only in 1943, due to the copper shortage during WWII.  It is the only US coin that can be picked up with a magnet.  I don't know of any "value" to the coin - for that you would have to actually take it to a coin dealer.

Zombie Deck - this deck is pretty sweet, it is basiclly more communication through the graveyard includes lots of special summoning! also u have to have zombie world field spell or its just useless!

zyzeHbocaa	This is a method that is free for you, but takes a bit of work. You go to this site, sign up, and complete "offers" to get points. You can use these points to cash in for various prizes, Habbo coins included. There is a $10 prepaid Habbo coins card on page 2 of the "Online Prizes" section, and a $25 card on page 6.    Before you disregard it, let me explain how it works. You complete these offers, which are just surveys and the like. These companies that have the surveys give money to Prize Rebel for them referring you, and PR passes off their profit to you in points. Cash in those points for free goodies. However, these surveys totally spam your email, so I recommend getting a new one before you start. Sign up for PR with your main one, but do the surveys with a different one.    You can also get a referral link and sign up your friends. You get 20% of their points as a bonus! So, if you refer someone and they make 10 points, you get 2 for free! So, you get your coins, free of charge (except for some time), and help me out with a referral bonus.    http://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=14...    Feel free to ask if you have any questions. ;)
zDGIjehgaa	well u cant use the god cards in a duel anyway but here are their effects:    Obelisk The Tormentor --- Unaffected by spells or traps     Winged Dragon of Ra --- ATK points are equal to the combined attack points of the monsters you use to summon him    Slifer The Sky Dragon --- Atk points are equal to the number of cards that are in your hand!    Furthermore you if you have all three on the field you can sacrfice one of them to give the third one unlimited attack strength!    cool huh?|`|LnYr2dLfaa	In dueling they have no effects because they cannot be used in any deck.    According to the anime series:  Obelisk the Tormentor: unaffected by Spells and Traps.  Slifer the Sky Dragon: 1,000 ATK for each card in the controller's hand.  Winged Dragon of Ra: ATK = combined attack for all monsters sacrificed for its summon.    All together you can sacrifice 2 of them to give 1 of them infinite strength.|`|lATfd35naa	go to this website, I found it helpful when I wanted to use mine.

No really.... why do you want one?|`|zpRZjyAQaa	Ruger 10-22 semi-automatic .22 cal rifle|`|U7UZqDbRaa	If you are just starting with guns get a .22 long rifle. Not much power, but cheap shells that are good for getting used to guns and accurately killing blackbirds.    If you have a little more practice look into getting a 20 gauge shotgun.  Good for walking through fields and blasting at birds.  Not as accurate, but is a spread shot and is quite fun.    If you are talking about a deer rifle get a .243 or a 30.06 Ruger.  30.06 is more powerfull and works good for dropping deer in their tracks.

I was so excited when I found out it came out next week!, Then they wrote on the website that they are delaying it until June 2nd! I asked my brother if it had happened with a game of his and he said yes. I also asked around and they said some games get delayed. I don't really know why it's gonna be delayed; they never said why.
SwDAZlqWaa	No, Valve has been fighting with microsoft about trying to release the downloadable content for free for a long time now, and microsoft refuses to let them do that. Hence, no content for console players.
40947c53900ba8c2ca9c27de9533b0b8aa	You'll have to make sure that not only did you place your downloaded files in the right directory (there should be a text file telling you where), but that you also activate the add in by checking it under the main loadup screen that shows before launching the game.    Making a house would require using the TES editor, and other downloaded houses can be obtained at specific websites. See my source links for more.|`|6c87307008094e9e07372ef9a829031daa	You could use the Construction set software to make a house, but it's a lot of work, and you can mess up and have to start over.    Or you can join House Hlaalu (or however you spell it) by going to their office building in Balmora.  After you join, you can do lots of quests for different quest-givers in the House, and eventually you'll be promoted to House Father or some such rank.  Then you talk to the guy at the back of the ground floor room in the Balmora house.  He will get you started on getting a house built at Odai Plateau.  It's a cool house: looks like a castle.|`|AA10266358	i have a better idea: kill a guy anside a house (make sure he is not important) and take his. you can also use the Ald'run mage's guild's top floor (2 bed rooms and a closet with lots of boxes) If you really look around, it shouldnt be hard for you to find lots of places that are empty and have lots of boxes
w2xsd28Qaa	they will all eventually be replaced.  i think it takes about a week in the game, but new ones will be standing guard eventually.    i personally like walking around town in guard armor|`|8eb608d3a90ca42a2dc16a5cb10c59caaa	im not sure...but i accidently killed all the gaurds in anvil LOL....and everytime i walk by there the bodies are still there....and i cant find gaurds around anywhere...|`|a118b8144112704be52f2ab81596333baa	Generic guards will be replaced (at least the ones in the wilderness), ones with names won't be, and some can't die until certain quest points and will only be knocked unconscious.|`|9679532c07fd553064300da70efd0842aa	you can't kill someone important, so if you can it doesn't matter. the bodes will disappears after 72 hours and new ones will replace them. the ones with a name won't come back. and you'll get a bounty (obviously!)
w2xsd28Qaa	just assign another spell or item to that hotkey, and the first one will be removed.|`|9679532c07fd553064300da70efd0842aa	it seems you can't remove it (or maybe I never figured out how) but you can replace it with something else. just hold the hot key and select something else. if you remove an item it will be removed from hot keys but you can't delete a spell without using cheats.
w2xsd28Qaa	NO!  It's made by the history channel!  IGN.com rated it a 5 out of 10, and theyre usually generous with their rankings.    according to that site, no multiplayer...|`|HEJrtnIiaa	Holy sh*t!  Way MORE intense than ANY game EVER created!!  EVEN Gears of WAR!!!!   Nothing is more exciting than getting in the middle of a gun fight and firing your one shot and then waiting thirty seconds to get off another!!!  Hardcore!!!  You feel LIKE you're there!!  You UP to the challENGE?|`|c842cdbc07ea6c432f95a945a2810bedaa	I heard its a pretty bad game, gameplay wise....i read its really frustrating and not fun. The civil war is a great historical topic to study, so you should stick to History Channels documentaries, or read a book. The game wont do it.    I hear that after every shot you have to wait for it to reload..like 30 secconds...Even though its realistic, for the time period.. its not fun for a video game.
w2xsd28Qaa	i believe the butterfly game changes depending on how far through the game you are.  if you come back later in the game, it should be a little harder, but you'll get the sigil.
GxA4X5B2aa	Tashi has made a good point, it might be a compatability issue with the expansion pack.  But it looks like a graphics problem, although I think I had that come up at one point...

MKZyKVWLaa	The BC and WotLK trails are only for people with a paid account, and add no time to said account. Basically, they're for people who've already been playing and want to see if they want to shell out the cash for the expansions.|`|tL9SuAWbaa	I don't believe it will...I think you have to make another new account, but you could try it for the account you arleady have it would not hurt.
aLyJe1b3aa	nope. it an alright game|`|HMhUKAgkaa	All I know (from watching Dr. Phil) is that this game is highly addictive and has caused people to commit suicide. Dr. Phil did a show on this game. A man neglected his kids, job, bills, and wife because he was so addicted to this game. In my opinion, it would be ok to let him play it but only in short increments of time. Good luck!|`|DU8zxsKRaa	Yes, the game is addictive, etc. like previously mentioned.      It doens't cause EVERYONE who plays it to lose the face of reality, only a freakish 0.001% of people or less will have problems that severe.    I had a similar conversation with my wife about letting our kids play Everquest (a game we both still play).    Our kids are 7, 8, and 9.  They do understand that the game isn't reality.  I don't think that they'll go out and kill rats and small dogs in real life.  So that's not why I don't want them playing yet.    The main reason we don't want them playing yet is the social aspect.  These games aren't designed to be solo games.  They are meant to be playing with other people (usually not in the same house) so you have to type fast and read fast to get things figured out of how the group wants to play.    My kids are slow readers, and non-existant typers.  If they were to try to get into a group, they wouldn't know what to do, and only manage to ruin someone else's attempt at playing.    I don't know how good your 11-year-old is.  He may be fine, he may be like our kids.    And yes, definatly if you allow him to play, set time limits, make sure he gets homework done first, make sure he does get some outside time on nice weekend weather days.  That's still your responsibility as a parent.|`|MKZyKVWLaa	If the child is responsible, I don't see the harm.  The game itself isn't overly sexual or violent or inherently negative in any way, but other players can get quite mouthy.    A lot of people claim all WoW players get addicted and have no life, but I find that's only true if you had no life before you started playing. If you're a decent student who studies and values their grades and whatnot, a single video game won't change that. Even if it does change that, there are parental controls so you can set when and how long he can play.    And honestly, the addiction thing is blown way out of proportion. It's not that everyone who plays is addicted, it's that everyone you HEAR about is addicted. I mean, "Guy plays Warcraft for a few hours a week and still contributes to society!" isn't an interesting story, a good headline. You know what will interest people though, "THIS DUDE LOST HIS JOB AND WIFE BECAUSE ALL HE DOES IS WARCRAFT ZOMGZ WHAT AN EVIL GAME!", so, that's what you hear from the media.|`|AA10833587	All games are addicting,hell yahoo answers is addictive.Only you know what is best for your child don't ask other peoples opinion because you won't get the answer you are looking for.My stepson plays it,he's 26 he has a full time job pays his rent and all his utilities and he's not neglecting anything.Piss on Dr Phil,the game is just a regular role playing game like any other game.Watch him play it at his cousin's house and you decide on whether purchasing the game.|`|yC1TCiRkaa	My son has been playing since he was 9....he is mature for his age, he realizes that some conversations are inappropriate for him, once he had been playing for a while, everyone knew his age and have been for the most part very sensitive to what they say. It is indeed a game that needs to be supervised as far as time goes. 2 hours can seem like half an hour easily. Otherwise it is good typing, spelling and communication practice as well as learning how to get along with different personality types and being responsible for a "job" while with a group.     I started an account to see what it was all about and to check it out...I now play as well. So it is nice to play with him and have some bonding time in a different format.    I don't know why people "hate" on this game....ignorance I suppose.|`|ivg0lRUraa	The game isn't bad but it may be the end of his life. It is very addicting and time consuming and you may see his personal relationships begin to fail.|`|jqbC4tlpaa	This game is all about killing enemies. Players are put on quests that direct them to obtain certain items, some of these items are on "creatures" others are on humanoid type monsters (some of these humanoids look quite a lot like ordinary people).     Additionally, there are all sorts of weaponry used by the players in this game. Although there are a lot of charachters to choose from, all of them have abilities unique to that character. Some characters are death knights, hunter, warrior, night elf, blood elf, and others.....    In my opinion, this could incite violent tendencies, not to mention becoming addicited to playing the game!|`|eEg5wp8Taa	Nothing Wrong with Massively Multilayer Online games, though I don't recommend WoW, it is much to developed, costs a lot initially plus it has a monthly fee.    I recommend you pick something else, perhaps Lord of the Rings MMO, Final Fantasy 11 or Warhammer.    Just make sure he gets exercise.    There is nothing addictive about WoW, there will be no withdraw effects if he stopped playing it. What it is though, is fun and keeps the interest so there is no desire to leave.    Not desiring to quit does not equal addictive.|`|qgKTqgNBaa	plz plz plz.. tel me your not going to listen to dr. phil. you can let him play. it is an alright game with mild action here and there. if you make him take regular breaks he will be fine.|`|dlJLUTkiaa	check these two videos    youngest WoW player ever - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHGCZemYu...

(there is the original game and 2 expansion packs)    i have met many interesting and nice people through the game and its a lot of fun.    and just for the record, i have a wonderful Girlfriend, a great job. i pay my bills and go out with my friends.  so its a stereotype that people that play it are lazy fat people.    Edit- to the person that said it could start violent tendensies....are you serious or just delusional?|`|rUbnCCDhaa	I know people in WoW that let their kids play at young ages but they are there to supervise.  There is some not so nice chat that goes on in there and the language filter doesnt catch everything plus the chat content can be very adult.|`|5NpI6rLwaa	I play, but i'm not sure i would let him play at that age, maybe a few years from now, dont listen to what u hear about Dr. Phil and Massive Addiction, as long as he/you can limit his play he should be ok. Of course there are other players that can be "stupid" with adult language and such, so u may want to think it over. and how old is his cousin? if he's older, than maybe wait till ur son is his age.  oh and take into consideration the Price, it has a monthly fee plus the cost of expansions, its a great game, but some people can get out of hand if they dont have limits.  Hope this helped :)|`|a786727400409a02aa43ad3cea49d5e5aa	My answer: No  Why?: Make him do real things with his friends play outside go to their house, World of Warcraft is a waste of time and he might play it too much.|`|nEQje1tRaa	yes i want my child to be the laughing stock of all children.. so yes. please let your child play WOW.|`|ZtF7LaLiaa	i would let nobody play WoW    would you not prefer your cousin to have a "life" in the real world.

bqdeD8JHaa	Only if you have soldering skills.  The cord has most likely broken, either at the contacts that go into the controler or somewhere before that. You'd have to take it apart and, once you're sure there isn't a break in the middle of the cable, re-solder the connections.  If this is a XBox 1 controller you can find them used for under $20, so it is most likely not worth the trouble.|`|fvrFL3yTaa	no, the connection wire on the back is messed up so its gonna skip in and out quite often... better to just go get another used controler than deal with the butt ache of loosin connection in the middle of a game
uP8ufTGjaa	Im not sure about that but if I were you I'd get number 4 or 5. Much better quality. Dogz and Catz 5 has a few more breeds but you have to play lots of games for food and toys rather that hust getting them. You can download tons of breed files of the internet when you find the game :D Personally, I think its really good and worth buying. Try ebay for a cheap version. You can also enter online shows with your pets and even breed them. Also, if you get the game i would reccomend downloading PetzA (    The new one isn't called number 2. Its either 6 or something else. Ive seen screenshots but never seen a place to buy the game.

(the other 36 we browsed and decided we'd rather by a different book.:))|`|Nz8KQfQTaa	at 1650 you don't yet have an understanding of basic imbalances  without this understanding you can't properly assess positions   I recomend IM Silmans book  reassess your chess 3rd edition       This book covers things like        1.  How to recognize if the bishop or knight is better in certain situations       2.  The 3 rules of space gaining       3    The 5 rules of the isolated pawn       4.   the factors that allow a combonation         and much more        this book was my favorite from 1600-2100|`|TcTXcOyDaa	Is this for you or someone else?  If it is a gift, it is difficult to choose a chess book for someone else.  If it is for you, you are already a pretty strong player (Class B - Not Bad).     I always enjoy a good book on combinations myself.|`|2b76943fe46383f5bffe500577585298aa	I think that answer really depends on what style of player you are.  If you are already strong in one area, you will want to concentrate in another area that will help you improve.  In my opinion, some of the best books for that level would be My System by Nimzowitch, Reassess your Chess by Silman (though may be for "slightly" lower rated players), Art of Attack is good, and if you can find it, a two book series called "The Middle Game" is great.|`|BNqbOfBsaa	"reasses your chess"  is good. But personally I think you learn more from studying one particular player. It jsut depends what kind of style you play and what kind of style you want to learn. NOt that you will play exactly like that player!      I personally like Capablanca, and Karpov         "best lessons of a chess coach"... is also good.|`|6jSxYrZnaa	I like "Think Like a Grandmaster" by Alexander Kotov and "Chess for Zebras: Thinking Differently About Black and White" by Jonathan Rowson. Books by Mark Dvoretsky are also good (but quite difficult generally). Jeremy Silman's books are often recommended but I haven't read them. Avoid anything by Eric Schiller and most books by Raymond Keene.     One of the most important things I've learned whilst being interested in chess is that hobby players place *way* too much emphasis on books. There is a well-known study (in chess circles) where it was found that grandmasters were no better than patzers at recalling a position that was totally arbitrary but were much better at recalling "logical" positions. In fact, a grandmaster can reconstruct one of these "logical" positions after only a few seconds of looking at it.     The point (yes, I have one) is that there is no such thing really as "talent" in chess (remember that grandmasters couldn't reconstruct nonsensical positions any better than beginners). This should tell us that it through hard work i.e. the constant analysis of games and positions that one can *really* get good at chess. Garry Kasparov was not born a chess genius, he made himself one.    Now, patzers don't generally want to study. They want to "learn" openings and they want to play. This is fine, but it is not possible to get good with this attitude - I think the maximum threshold is about 1800 (for what is attainable with this mentality).     Sorry to answer a question you didn't answer, but I thought you may want to know this.|`|YMHsibG8aa	The art of attack in chess.

l6lh6fT8aa	Actually...it's several things.    1. Milling is much more powerful then it once was. Millstone is now fairly inefficient compared to new spells like Glimpse The Unthinkable, Traumatize, and Memory Erosion. Millstone, while it is constant, simply can't mill fast enough to be worth it most of the time. It's consistant, but it doesn't have enough power behind it.    2. Millstone has been released in many, many, many sets. There are many Millstones. Obviously, this makes the value go down.    3. Millstone's monopoly on "repeatable milling effects" has been broken. When Millstone was first released, it was the only way to mill anyone. For a long time after that, it was the only consistant mill effect. Now, there's plenty of enchantments that have passive effects that allow you to mill away your opponent, and they are usually better then Millstone (as they don't require mana to be pumped into them). There are some creatures, as well, with repeatable mill effects (Cathartic Adept, Ambassador Laquatas).

6N3yjlXhaa	U.S. MATTRESS SIZES   Twin 39 x 75    U.S. QUILT SIZES - Commercial Comforter size (minimal overhang)  Twin 65 x 88    You choose    1 = 91 blocks;   2 = 165 blocks|`|SdHqyWKHaa	A standard size for a twin-size quilt is around 6' wide by 8' to 8 1/2' long; the exact size depends on the size of the blocks you want to use. You mention "6 inch blocks", but we need to know if that's how big you want to cut them (called the 'cut size') or how big they look after they're sewn together (called the 'finished size'). If you cut pieces of fabric 6" square, when you sew them together with the standard 1/4" seam allowance they measure only 5 1/2" from seam to seam; if you want them to look like 6" squares, you have to cut them 6 1/2". Assuming you want to cut 6" squares to finish 5.5", plan to cut 234 - this will give you a quilt that measures 71 1/2" x 99" (18 rows of 13 squares each). If you want to cut 6 1/2" squares to finish 6", cut 216 squares, which gives you a quilt that measures 72" x 108".

c648a9388b1a88dfae79131156aa6523aa	I'm assuming you mean "Blokus", as I can't find any game by the name of "Blockus" exactly.    Use up all of your large pieces first.  Not only are they harder to place at the end of the game, but they're also worth more penalty points since it's per unit that makes up each piece.    Play aggressively.  When you see a chance to block someone in, do it!  That is the whole point of the game.  Always play to deny your opponent(s) building space, then go back and build in the areas that you are in no danger of losing out to.

You just get ones you like just like how people get a ton of different necklaces but they're all together.|`|SdHqyWKHaa	Some people use them to commemorate special events in their lives - they start with the bracelet itself and then add charms whenever they want to memorialize an occasion. For instance, they might add a 'mortarboard cap' charm to mark graduation, a 'key' charm for their first place of their own, a dog or cat charm for a favorite pet, a souvenir of a great vacation, a tennis racquet or golf club for a favorite sport, a baby bottle to celebrate a child, and so on.   Some people find this idea very appealing, others just don't see the point. You also have to be comfortable with noisy, jiggly jewelry on your wrist. If the thought doesn't make you go 'awwwwww', you probably won't enjoy a charm bracelet.

5HGDhEjyaa	How about scrapbooking.  This is a fun hobby that is booming.  To get your started, you can take classes at Michael's for a reasonable fee and learn some quick techniques.  You can purchase your products there.  You will need an album, pretty paper, adhesive and some stickers.  I would start with a small project, maybe a trip you took during a 3-day weekend, or Christmas pictures.  After you get comfortable doing a small album, you can do a 12 x 12 album of all of your baby pictures, or pictures of your parents, that are probably all in a shoe box under the bed.  It's really a fun hobby.  Hope you can give it a shot.  Good luck !

CGhd7xPPaa	The time starts as soon as you register it.  No matter how much you play the game, the trial is being used.  Even if you're not playing.  So after registration your trial will be over in 14 days.|`|9y1uYUm3aa	within those 14 days it counts whether you play or not|`|BNBKVpz2aa	Well the Time starts when you first make the Trial account. By the way WoW is a great game Have Fun!|`|o6IGucJmaa	no its inst because i downloaded it and went on holiday for a week and only went on it a couple of times and it said my time was up to order go on line or something like that|`|4El5rPbyaa	the 1hour your talking about, that only counts to your ingame played time.  The 14 day trial lasts for 14 days IRL (in real life) so that's as long as you can play it... but it's worth getting the full version! it's a great game!|`|0le6RYndaa	You can play as much as you want within those 14 days.

(And maybe cheaper). You need the code to register it. You should report the makers of the machine to someone and they can try to get you a new code, and they can take out the machine. I think that if that happened to other people, they are getting ripped off, and that is bad business. Like I said next time just buy it at a store.

auUeI2Vnaa	Why would anyone cry?  Depends on what you are looking at...if you are talking about economics, you want to expect the unexpected so that you are always prepared for what COULD happen, but you can never be prepared for whats unexpeted really because you don't know it's coming.    If you are talking like in a magic show, they are just trying to get people pumped for something they haven't seen yet.  You may be waiting to see the unexpected, but you can't really expect anything because you have no idea whats coming.|`|WX1b747Iaa	Chance favors the prepared mind.    -Louis Pasteur|`|2c2W4zQJaa	There's always exceptions|`|EhDFNQ5iaa	Thats easy.

CjsFtjuhaa	Well, I looked in Wikipedia and this is what I found:        In 2008, Bennington announced the that Linkin Park's fourth studio release will be a concept album. The band has not released many specific details about the album. In an interview with MTV in November 2008, Bennington stated, "It sounds a little daunting to me, so, I think my confidence level will drop, but when it was presented to us by this friend of ours, we liked the idea. It was an inspiring idea, and it was something we could relate a lot of the things we like to write about to." He also added that the band planned to begin recording in December for a six-week session. He expects the album itself to be released in mid 2009.|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	Do you know how many ask this?!

Over four quarters, you will have a 4 in 100 chance of winning or a 1 in 25 chance of winning.     In reality the odds are different because of the way football is scored and how one each box has the potential to win more than one time.    P.S. I won $125 in the 4th quarter last night. I had 10 boxes which cost me $30 ($3 per box).|`|2d643fe2509c39d5e9d2affcc16d13bcaa	It pays 4 quarters? You have one square?   Your odds of hitting one is twentyfive to one.

lG7HdW6Gaa	Check your shadow settings. The new shadow rendering programming they put into the game heavily affects your FPS. I found this to be my problem when they put out the patch right before WotLK. Turn your shadowing setting way down and your FPS should increase. If your shadowing setting is already down you may want to look into other visual settings. While your specs are pretty good, the only way you're going to get your game to run with full visuals would be to run a dual video card system. You may also want to try getting a removable piece of memory (such as a thumb drive) and use it as extra memory if you're running Vista.     Good Luck|`|AqKOVEDGaa	Since you say it started happening since WotLK came out, it looks like it is just that. A lot of people have this problem.  Your computer is good enough.
HqVPMWGDaa	ok I have been in your shoes. Go to you tube and search knitting     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_hl7HGMD...  If you are using circular needles.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXf3FIBPi...  If you are using double pointed needles I prefer this method. It you are going to do it this way divide you needles by 3 2 will have 28, and one will have 26. This video should help you. If not they have tons of videos on how to. I learned how to make socks on you tube. I am addicted to knittin socks now. lol. Good luck on you hat|`|AA12177717	Spread your stitches along the cable so that the first stitch you cast on is at the needle tip at the left and the last stitch cast on is at the needle tip at the right.  Be absolutely certain that the cast on is not twisted around the cable.  Now, transfer the last stitch to the left needle, pick up the first stitch and lift it over the last stitch and onto the right needle.  Put a marker between these two stitches.  You are now joined, without a twist, and you won't have the little jog or gap between the beginning and the end.|`|z6RmVT5xaa	This is one of those that's so easy once you get the concept but hard to explain.  Okay, you've cast on your stitches and now you hold one needle (end) in your right hand with the yarn on that side.  You want to then knit the stitch at the end (left hand) of the other side of the circle onto the needle in your right hand with that yarn.    The trick is to be sure you don't twist your stitches.  Personally I find it easiest to hold the needles in a circle with the "stitches" towards the middle of that circle.  That makes it easier to be sure you have it straight.   I've read that some just knit as if on straights for several rows and then join in order to be sure they don't twist.  But then they have to make a mini-seam to compensate. I include this because it might be easier for you - but I sure don't see it myself.  It seems to me easier just to be a little anal about that first stitch and then there's no problem.    Once you've done that first linking stitch, it's easy sailing from then on.    Enjoy.|`|q0EwnYroaa	knitting in round.   on circulars + joining - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlNn2ph4H...  on dpns + joining - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQVl8VtXO...  the link for dpns was a great help for me i am sure you will understand it her instructions are very very clear.|`|154dzJ1Faa	As others have said, this is very simple and very basic.  One of the things you need to know to be able to knit anything.    I get my beginners to knit a hat as the very first lesson.  We use double point, but you can also use circular needles. (all circular needles are double pointed)    So all you need to do is knit the first stitch after you cast-on that last stitch, and just keep on going!  There are several different ways to do this, and you will look at them all, and use whichever you happen to like in this case.  None are wrong, some are better for special effects you want to achieve.  And yes, there are some things to watch for.  It's not hard, but you do need to be careful what you are doing.  As in all things, you need to do it smoothly and neatly and carefully and most important, correctly.  It's just that easy.

qGP1bc5Taa	To make an English longbow you would need a stave of dry wood about six feet long.  (You're best off cutting this yourself as I'm not sure where you could buy one).  Yew is traditional, but most woods will work.    Split it lengthwise, take one half and split that lengthwise.  You now have a quarter of a stave with an almost triangular cross section.  That is the main part of the bow.  The differences in the wood will give you the spring required.      Shape it, and then attach a bowstring... (If you're just trying to prove a point to your dad then any old string should work...)     You're done.  Of course there's a bit more to it than that, (the shape it stage is where most of your work will be) but that's the basics.  You now have a traditional English longbow.  These things were pretty deadly.|`|kIqq7yIAaa	join a medieval live action roleplaying group like amtgard  we use bows in our reenactments all the time with no danger to  anyone  we also have people who hand make bows and would be happy to show you how to do that as well    go to amtgardwiki and look for a group near you    BTW a bow without arrows is not dangerous so your dad is off the deep end on this  ask him to take you down to a hunting/archery shop to try out childrens bows on the range  archery is a great sport and some high schools have teams

They may be able to order a certain color for you.      Other than that, you could try using fabric paint on a light beige book.  Get a large bottle and use a wide natural brush and brush it on lightly until you have the shade you want.

My 360 has broken 3 times now, while PS3's have a 0.2% chance of breaking.  And all the games are the same, except 360 has Halo series and Gears of War series, while PS3 has Resistance, LittleBigPlanet, Metal Gear Solid, and a lot more I do belive.    I read some of the other answers, and one person mentioned games that you can get on either console....Just thought I'd point that one out... :D|`|GbJ5OdARaa	xbox 360: yea the live cost money but it is way better and way more fun then the ps3s version of live.

l92miMsVaa	Totally go with Capture The Flag. I've been in my troop for three years now and every year we have a capture the flag camp-out.

d9PCLhh7aa	So its simple Shaymin is going to be my second event cause when for Darkrai this is what they did, so i opened up mystery gift and the first time you open it up it will say " gift detected" or somthing around that. Then it will say the gift name for Darkrai it said" The rise of Darkrai" and then it said is this the gift you want to recieve? Then it said pick up your gift at the delivery man at the pokemart. Then he gives it to you.    Yes it is same each time, unless there doing the item kind of event where they give you the item and you have to catch it, but in this case the delivery man in the poke'mart will give it to you.|`|2QSPkrakaa	i heared its a different pokemon every other event|`|e9WIWHGQaa	Your friend is telling the truth. That's how i got my Shaymin! They r awesome. Try going to seribii.net to find anything about pokemon! Good luck   =)|`|hrqrlLyKaa	its true|`|etB81AVNaa	Its super duper easy. I went to the darkrai event toys r us had and all I did was turn on my ds, picked wonder card on menu screen, and darkrai was right there ready to download. If you have Pokemon battle revolution it should be the same as buying something off the mart.     And if your worried you'll look silly being there because of your age, trust me, there all kinds of people there. I'm 18 and I'm making sure I get my shaymin.
cBZttoXnaa	Depends on what you like. If you're into Final Fantasy, just find an RP forum for it, then sign up.   After that, just post saying that you're new to the RP world and that you'd like to learn how to RP.    I can only think of one forum at the moment that is REALLY helpful with this kind of stuff.  Are you into Fire Emblem?|`|k9KJrjLxaa	There's a great one called "Tales of Zephyr- Of Good and Evil" that is relatively new, but very fun and active. Its fantasy based, so most things go.

dFTr5IPwaa	what pokemon is it?    email me and i can help you|`|Pw1y449Daa	Yeah you need to be a little more specific about the pokemon your trying to evolve.  Your Pokemon won't evolve probably because they need to meet their max happiness, or they need a stone to evolve, or they need to be traded with or without an item.|`|QJwaagGWaa	You should have told us the Pokemons name, so we could see who it is...... Other than that, the pokemon probably evolves with Happiness, which you have to make the pokemon like you. You have to train it more, have it with you, give it berries, leave it on daycare center, give it Proteins, Carbos, etc,and slowly, it would start to love you better and eventually evolve.|`|8Vkvq9YKaa	it depens which pokemon it is.  you can look online at www.pokedream.com/pokerep to check it out|`|jbrhGTBBaa	what kind of pokemon is it?

3xXIKcMOaa	Hate to burst ya'll bubble, but there has been no official saying from Nintendo about the remake of GSC, as of yet.     AND, I will bet my years pay check we will not be seeing a remake of these three at the end of the year.   Red/Blue: September 30, 1998  Yellow: October 19, 1999  Gold/Silver: September 4, 2000  Crystal: July 29, 2001  Sapphire/Ruby: March 17, 2003  Fire/Leaf: September 7, 2004  Emerald: May 1, 2005  Diamond/Pearl: April 22, 2007  Platinum: 3/22/09    Platinum isn't even out yet, and there would be a year gap between a remake.   AND knowing how Nintendo likes to build the suspense up on future games, they would have let some kind of screen play or picture out by now, to get people excited about a possible upcoming.  If it makes you feel any better, Nintendo did copyright some colors for future games, but there is no proof they will actually do anything with them. :/    Nintendo knows GSC was a huge hit. I'm thinking they are saving a remake for whenever they know Pokemon is being over killed.|`|dFTr5IPwaa	you realise about 10 pokemon fans will read this. if you really want to (try to) spread the word, go to serebii.net and go on the forums there|`|jbrhGTBBaa	They are doing one already!

1RtGjzTUaa	I agree with marc, it all depends on what weapon types (era) you like.  I have both and each one is special & great.  They are both the same in gameplay except for WaW in Multiplayer mode, you are able to drive tanks.  I like both, but my preference would be in the modern warfare if I had to choose.  They are now developing Modern Warfare 2 though, so be on the look out for that.|`|uXRhHkkSaa	i think world at war because it has nazi zombies where nazis are back from the dead and you have to kill them,and the weapons are awesome|`|1fYzTWb4aa	I agree with Marc also, but if I had to choose, I would choose MD|`|jxpV13rTaa	their both really good and really similar..i have both and im glad i do..wouldnt want to pick. the new one will have a lot more people playing, and has soem great new features, but it just depends if you like modern or WWII better i guess.

In Wind Waker you start the game all over again but you have different clothes, the game is harder and you keep your bottles. But in Zelda ocarina of time and in all the other Zelda games you can't save your game nor keep playing after beating him.

KZJIjrguaa	There are six categories, each with 5 questions of increasing difficulty. (valued at $200, $400, $600, $800, and $1,000). The first player chooses a question, and then one of the 3 people buzz in. If you get it right, you earn the money, however if you're wrong, you lose the money, and the other players get a chance to buzz in. If you get it right, you also gain control and choose the next question.    The catch is you have to answer in the form of a question. If the answer is Harry Truman, you can't buzz in and say, "Harry Truman". You have to say, "Who was Harry Truman?"    Hidden somewhere on the board is a Daily Double, it is only for the player who selected it (no buzzing-in) and it's significantly harder than the rest. Before you see the clue, you get to choose how much money to risk on it. Get it right, and gain the money, but lose it if you get it wrong.     Play continues until A) The players complete all 30 questions or B) Time runs out for the round.    The contestants then play another round, called Double Jeopardy!. It's the same as the first round except the categories are tougher, the dollar values are doubled, and there are two Daily Doubles instead of one.    Lastly, there's Final Jeopardy!. A category is shown, and the players choose how much money to risk. Then, the clue is shown, and the players have 30 seconds (insert music here) to come up with the correct response. A correct response gains money, and incorrect response loses money. After the game is finished, the winner gets to keep their money and return the next day to try and win more. The second place winner gets $2,000, and third nets $1,000.|`|87Xsok8Gaa	The simplest explanation is that there are categories, and contestants take turns picking "answers" from each category. Whoever got the right answer last gets to pick the next one.    For example, there might be a category called "Food." A contestant could say, "Food for $300", and it will reveal: "This cheesy Italian food is cut into triangles."     Answers are given in the form of a question. In this example the correct question would probably be "What is pizza?"

22oMednCaa	You could get a full-on prosthetic. I'm sure they're not cheap, but since this is only a partial little finger, it may not be as much as you think:  http://www.livingskin.com/Home/Finger.ht...    You probably know that Tony Iommi (Black Sabbath) had somewhat less than 10 fingers. He just made little fake fingertips out of plastic, and coated them with rubber tool dip. They weren't super pretty, but obviously, they worked.    That's what I'd do. Use whatever's available to make the extension part-- clay, plastic? Put a little padding in it where your finger goes. And I guess you could use a "finger cot" to hold the tip on. (If you don't know, finger cots are those little finger condoms cooks use to cover cuts, and bankers use to count money. Like this: http://www.fingercots.net/.)    Good luck, and keep rockin'!|`|kIqq7yIAaa	don't let that stop you from rocking out  just look at the drummer for Def Leopard he lost his whole arm in a car wreck but he still plays drums    adapt and overcome my friend|`|uirnyVeuaa	Cut of a toe and use that as a replacement    wait wat

ZiOZ4Qsdaa	Try the Marketplace and go B>(insert scroll name here) If it's a good day and you try long enough, you'll probably get several offers.    Some monsters drop INT scroll, such as Mano.

Hidden Street: http://global.hidden-street.net/monsters... has a complete list of monsters and what they drop, so you can specifically check what monsters around your level drop the scroll you want.

Real historical events also occur, keeping you up to date with what was going on in the world.    All units are accurately designed and implemented into Empire: Total War to provide you with a unique feeling of realism. The campaign map is also skillfully drawn from REAL satellite imagery. 3D naval battles have now been introduced, graphics refined and land conflicts adjusted for an optimal experience. Gentleman are used for encacting diplomacy (alliances, tribute payments etc) and Rakes can be used for espionage, plus assassination. Religion plays a role and of course, government types can be changed.    It's even possible that up to 100 historical characters appear such as Napoleon Bonarprate, Charles XI of Sweden and George Washington.  --------------------------------------...  Use and take advantage of:    - Artillery like cannons, landmines (primitive fuse wiring), grandiers (iron ball with fuse-wire)    - Gunpowder soldiers armed with muskets, pistols and bayonets, later better weaponry is invented.    - Cavalry of all sorts, including elephants.    - Different formations and cover systems to bring variety to unit choices    - Much more!  --------------------------------------...  10 playable factions are available at the moment, and more are unlockable once you defeat them in your goals for domination and glory.    - Kingdom of Great Britain  - Kingdom of Prussia  - Kingdom of France  - The Ottoman Empire  - The Spanish Empire  - Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth  - United Provinces (Dutch)  - 13 colonies of America  - Russia  - Mughal Empire    (Make sure you have a very good computer so you can run the demanding game).  --------------------------------------...    Try Medieval II: Total War and Rome: Total War - they are both excellent as well.
uXS6b847aa	It's the Vista. It's extremely unreliable, no matter what everyone says, ESPECIALLY for gaming. Nothing really to fix it but to switch computers or hard-drives.|`|glHbgpAAaa	its too long for me to explain here but just watch this video.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmssers0n...|`|Zo7IQX3raa	vista.... plz plz plz pick me (never had bets answer)|`|8oBawBYLaa	Try lowering the graphics of the game.|`|46864596f0eb8c0afb49fb09d1138950aa	Go figure. Vista. You should make you own computer if you have the money or just play on another computer. I'm not sure if this works but while playing you may want to shut off any unnessicary stuff(AIM,iExplorer,ECT) or its because of you router(?) or simply you have a virus. Try to remember what you downloaded 2 moths ago. My dad downloaded somestuff and his computer crashed.
Zo7IQX3raa	I have one! I have 26.... i am soo addicted but now im kinda bored of it. Is tll get on everyday though. Add me my username is pinkswirler|`|kDdjf4qRaa	cool|`|8ymKgIaMaa	no I do not but I'm going to get one.

dpGNPT4waa	try this,     have Ashe use Decoy and Reverse on her self, (use Decoy before the fight starts and use Reverse when the fight starts)...      Make Fran and Vaan HP Crit. (HPs in RED almost dead) give them the most strongest wpns you got if you got 2 Fomalhaut's(The best Gun) give them those if not give them the best swords you got.......Also make sure you learned... "Adrenaline" on the License Board, if you don't have LP for it buy you some "Steel Gorget" with Adrenaline and Steel Gorget in HP Crit. Vaan and Fran will do Massive damage they will do 9,999 if you got Fomalhaut's they could do that much with swords if you got the good ones....      Now, before the fight have Vaan and Fran in Hp RED, make them use Haste, Bravery, and Berserk     For Ashe, have her buff up and use Decoy and Reverse, as i said before you will start the fight with Ashe "ALONE" with Decoy Tyrant will only attack Ashe, with Reverse Ashe don't take any Damage when Tyrant hits her she will heal instead so she will tank...as soon as Tryrant locks on her bring in Vaan and Fran Tyrant will drop before your Reverse runs out if you are doing 9,999 a hit.

gFWzHqEKaa	To get it first you need three bones:  Blue: Can be obtained from the mine  Green: Can be obtained from the mine  Red: Can be bought at Costolots    And you also need an ambar that can be gotten  from the wishing well by throwing it 9999 chocolate  coins or buying it at Costolots after watching the  credits from the main menu.    After you get these four items you need to place  them in a store house.  Depending on the color and the order you place the  bones is the type of pi?ata you get:    Skull- Type of head  Red- Triceratops  Blue- Stegosaurus  Green- Brontosaurus    Ribs- Type of tail  Red- Flat, seven spiked club  Blue- Pointed tail,four long spikes  Green- Tail fan    Spine- Type of color  Red- Purple  Blue- Blue  Green- Green    After you place them in the store house they will fuse  into an egg. You need a cluckles with a jurassic hair wig  to hatch it.To fully mature it you need to feed it a bottle   of milk, a bone, a geckie, a cocoadile and a jameleon.
