wLgGD63raa	It definitely sounds like metabolic bone disease to me.<br>  <br>  MBD is complex disease. In it's simplest terms, MBD results from an improper calcium to phosphorus ratio in the body. When the calcium level is relatively low the body tries to compensate by taking calcium from wherever it can, for example the bones. This leads to a softening of the bones, making them susceptible to fractures and also leading to a deposition of fibrous tissue as the body tries to strengthen the bone in an absence of available calcium. Calcium also impacts a number of other physiological systems including muscle contraction (including the heart) and blood clotting.<br>  <br>  As well as the calcium powder you should probably go back and buy a multi-vitamin for your crested at the pet shop, they will hopefully be able to help you out there. If you do not already have a UVB bulb, I would pick one up. UVB is essential to your gecko it, they use it in order to properly process the calcium and vitamins that they need, and this will help it in it's healing process.|`|VukTbsCUaa	Go to this reptile web site <br>  www.beardeddragon.com<br>  they are great there and they have all sorts of experienced pet owners that can help with different reptiles
4aAhEK9daa	Yes - you're absolutely right about gradually mixing in a food when you want to change to a new one.  And you're also right that Purina is garbage.  But for a lot of shelters, it's all they can afford and/or all that's donated to them.<br>  <br>  Purina, and most of the other foods you find at grocery stores and WalMart contain little to no meat and are made mostly of corn.  Cats are carnivores and should be eating foods with MEAT as the main ingredient, with a high amount of protein and with little to no grain.  Innova Evo, Blue Buffalo Wilderness and Petcurean Go! Natural are all excellent ones - 45-50% meat-based protein and NO grain.  <br>  <br>  They do cost more per pound to buy, but since they're so nutrient-dense your cats will eat a lot less of it and be full.  So you won't buy it as often.  And since the cats' bodies will utilize more of the ingredients - since these foods lack the fillers of the cheap foods - less will come out the "other end" - so less waste to scoop and less litter changing.  So it really doesn't end up costing that much more.  Plus your cats will be happier, healthier and have nice soft, shiny coat and won't end up obese or malnourished so it's well worth the extra cost.<br>  <br>  Interesting to note is that you'll often see on the internet that you shouldn't free feed cats - you should only put food out for them twice a day.  I give my cats canned food once a day and their bowls of a mix of those three dry food brands I mentioned are always out.  My Persian, Percy nibbles all day - and yet he's been the same 10.9 pounds for every vet visit for the last two years!  So you CAN leave dry food out if it's a quality, healthy food like these ones.  If you do notice a cat eating of boredom, of course take the bowls up but with my four cats not a single one of them does.  And the vets - and the judges - almost comment on how my cats are of the perfect build.|`|9byacd9Naa	Because dry cat food contains more starch and more carbohydrates than canned cat food, some have argued that a diet containing large amounts of carbohydrates is unnatural for a cat that is anatomically and physiologically designed to be a carnivore.<br>  <br>  Therefore, I think cat would have to purge canned foods if they have to eat them very often.

The reason that grocery store foods like Purina aren't the best for your cat is that they are full of cheap fillers - corn and by products.  Corn has very little nutritional value for a carnivore, and is the source of many tummy upsets and stinky litter boxes.  By products aren't meat - they are all the scrap "parts" that have been deemed unfit for human consumption.  They are such tasty treats as beaks, hides, tendons, spinal chords, intestines, diseased and spoiled meat - even the scrapings off the slaughterhouse floor.  That's not exactly great nutrition for your cat, even though it technically meets their nutritional needs.<br>  <br>  Go to the pet store, and find yourself a food free of corn and by-products.  Ideally you'd feed your cats an all-canned diet.  Dry food was meant for our convenience, and not for our cat's health, and has been linked to such feline disorders as obesity, diabetes, urinary tract disorders, and even kidney disease.  Read the igredients of each bag or can you pick up, and put back any where corn is listed in the first 4 or 5 ingredients, or ones that contain by-products.<br>  <br>  Do mix the food when you change it - one, it will prevent any kind of digestive upsets from a sudden change, and two, it will give them time to get used to it.  Sometimes it can be hard to wean cats from a junk food diet, just like it's herd to get a little kid to eat a healthy meal when they are used to McDonald's burgers and fries!

Better to keep them separated. l'd also get him neutered before she comes into heat again, or get her spayed.<br>  l'm getting my 7 month old pup neutered next month, to avoid the problem of keeping him separated from my Milly when she has her next heat.<br>  <br>  Be prepared for him to howl the house down!!!|`|3zv2bbolaa	Yes, absolutely. Many males become fertile around six months of age and even though there is a size difference, dogs can manage amazing feats when it comes to breeding. <br>  <br>  Please keep her isolated for the duration of her heat cycle.|`|0e51HkpHaa	He will try, if you don't want puppies he will get her pregnant first try.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Yep, I would.  Just to be on the safe side.  You never really know.|`|cSOwqXKxaa	Not if you live up to your responsibility as a Pet Parent and spay the female and neuter the male.  Then they can play together all of the time!  : )<br>  <br>  Fixing your dogs can lengthen their lives as well as improve their quality of life by removing factors such as uterine and testicle cancer.  And if you neuter your male before adolescence, it should improve his temperament as well.<br>  <br>  But yes - until you do that, keep them far away from each other and don't take your eyes of them for a minute.  I read somewhere about the 2 Door Rule - always keep 2 barriers between them to prevent a mating.|`|TWfDAYK4aa	Considering my female Rottweiler stretched out on the ground with her"good girl" in the air, screaming come and get me to any male that was around, yes, believe it or not size does not matter.  For, where there is a will, they will always find a way.  Your male is at the right age to be able to breed, so keep them separated.  Better yet, he is at the perfect age to neuter, so consider that option.  <br>  <br>  For the record, my girl did that to my neutered male, and he showed no interest.  But, your boy will, so if your girl should put herself in such a position, the result would be more unneeded puppies in the world.|`|fOLO4TNhaa	Yes you should. Of course, cause he is the son of your 3 year old. I think you should have her spayed, you already bred her once. You said she is done now so have her spayed. Also have the 2 pups fixed as well. You bred once, so now its time to start getting them fixed.|`|090e12392ae29e1e6da569bbe031aaf6aa	Yes. And after wards, get them fixed so you won't have to worry about it again.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Yes you absolutely do need to keep them apart.  Our shelter had a litter of chihuahua/Australian shepherd pups this year.  It absolutely can happen.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	Yes. He is now old enough to be neutered.|`|xz1Eqm47aa	Yes keep them away. and get him neutered and her spayed|`|3a1d98e5d06e33a288cfd5d40b0c4470aa	Nothing to worry about. He is too young and inexperienced, neither has his hormonal male instinct kicked in yet. There is absolutely no need to separate them at this stage. When he is fully matured, she may be the kind of female that will not lower herself and he can hump her all he likes, but she will stand up every time he tries to enter, thereby making him slide down to the ground. The only time a smaller male can enter a female on heat is when she lies down and puts her tail to the side. There is absolutely no guarantee this will happen. Dogs can be quite funny when it comes to mating and they do not like you to interfere, although experienced breeders have found ways to force penetration with different sized dogs. Don't listen too much to all the hype about neutering and spaying. I understand that shelters who see much suffering from so many abandoned dogs, this need not apply to your situation. A male dog will not mate until after 18 months at least. I speak from experience. Watch them and see how they interact. For future reference, the time to separate them when he is fully matured, is usually when the vulva prominently sticks out and she wafts her six-pence half penny in front of his nose. You can't miss it. She will have stopped bleeding and ask him to come to her! Neutering and spaying is fine for the older dog, but what people do not tell you is the hormonal trauma dogs experience when young. It can totally change their character and not in a good way. It does not stop aggressive behaviour either. It can however totally interfere with their confidence. To watch the confusion brought on by hormonal disability is tragic.<br>  <br>  The majority of posters will find my comments unreasonable and even irresponsible, but people have been so indoctrinated by the mass hysteria, they forget that animals have cycles for a reason. An entire dog or female can be trained by a responsible owner to deal with this in better ways. Why don't they castrate convicted paedophiles? You decide on what you think is right for your situation, and accept the responsibility that may be required in the future. People need to remember that we are entitled to agree to disagree. That is what makes for a mature and intelligent society.|`|gEhVy5okaa	yes you definitely need to keep the female away from the 6 month old male dog .... unless you want puppies! a male dog can get a female dog pregnant starting at 6 months old!<br>  <br>  i had a female mini cocker spaniel and my brother -in law had a pug that was 6 months old and my daughter let both dogs outside together after she told us the female was inside, and bam next thing we know 3 months later she was showing majorly and had 6 puppies!|`|OAybf9juaa	yes keep them away because he can certainly get her pregnant|`|fzV0R8HSaa	If the male wants to reach the female, he will find a way.  A six month old male can be mature enough to reproduce.  Keep them separated.
tCmwFJn5aa	Well it sounds as though someone took her.  Don't be depressed.  You could put up flyers in your neighborhood and offer a little reward.  If she does not show up soon, I think that you should look for another kitten.|`|Jy6dFXjVaa	Believe me, you aren't the only person who has had an animal they loved run away. It really depends on the animal's personality. Maybe your cat went looking for a girlfriend or if it was female, perhaps she found a safe place to have kittens. Once someone starts feeding an animal, sometimes the animal feels like it has found a new home where someone else loves it, as well. <br>  <br>  Other than what others have suggested about putting up some signs in your neighborhood and a couple of neighborhoods around yours where your cat went missing, there isn't much that you can do. I know that I took in some "stray" cats, one of whom had been abused. It didn't take very long for that cat to form a strong bond with me, especially when you provide a good home, plenty of fresh food and water and the animal has been neutured. When you neuter your animals, you don't have to worry about them straying quite as much. Sometimes, those animals that have been 'fixed' don't want to go far from home and they become lazy, loving animals. When they aren't fixed, sometimes they search for other animals for companionship and then they don't find their way back home to you.<br>  <br>  I hope that your cat wasn't picked up by your local pound. That's always the best place to look when an animal goes "missing" but it doesn't always mean you will find your animal there. There are lots of reasons that animals are at home one day and the next day, they are gone for good. I know because I've been in your shoes except that I found out that a neighbor who loves dogs and hated cats trapped some of the cats on our street and hauled them out to the country where he dropped them off. I hope that your cat has good survival instincts. I know that mine did and I've never forgiven that mean man who trapped not only my cat but two others on this street within just a couple of days of one another. Unfortunately for the neighbor, his two daughters couldn't keep their big mouths shut and that's how my neighbors and I found out about what happened so suddenly to our cats. <br>  <br>  I have dogs now and they aren't allowed outside without being on a leash. I don't want any of them to get run over by a car or have to pay to get them out of the dog pound. It's really the safest way for dogs but really doesn't apply to cats.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck finding your cat. Perhaps it will show up of it's own accord in a few days. It's always so sad to lose an animal, no matter what the reason.|`|c7kl4yjaaa	You should keep looking for your cat. Go around and give them flyers of your cat and see if they could help you find her. <br>  <br>  Never give up. The same thing happened to me. My cat also was an indoor outdoor cat. Then one day he disappeared. I kept looking and two and a half months later someone responed to one of my flyers saying they had found my cat. he had went about 5 miles from where he lived. I took him to the vet after that and they simply said that he was probably just looking for  a  mate since there were no local cats where i lived.<br>  <br>  But keep looking for your cat and i hope you find her soon. dont give up! GOOD LUCK!!|`|rHGWnkdsaa	umm i had a cat too and it ran awy once. there is special companies that search for messing pets. but wat i did is post a note in the street and put my phonenumber + a price for the finder|`|HaQl99X7aa	In the morning you should put up posters with her pictures on it and post her picture in the newspaper. Maybe ask your work and put posters there. I hope you find you cat<br>  GOOD LUCK =)|`|ZVwqmfDEaa	most cats come back. if it doesn't come back by tomorrow post lost posters up. but usually if its a male cat they go after the female cats on heat..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck...|`|jh00NAj3aa	If it doesn't come back, make sure to check at your local shelters, never know, someone could have taken it there. Good luck.  I know I'd be really upset if my cats ran away.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	put up some posters with pictures of your cat|`|RN1wGlWWaa	This is why its not good to allow a cat outside unsupervised.  If she is not spayed, she probably is being bred by tom cats.  Or someone took her in.<br>  <br>  If she comes home, then start training to a harness/leash or build/buy a cat enclosure and do not let her just roam without knowing where she is.|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	Take something that has your cat's scent on it ( bedding, shirt, towel, etc ) and hang it outside.  The "breeze" will carry her scent throughout the neighborhood, and if she's still nearby, she should be able to follow her OWN scent back HOME.<br>  <br>  This worked for me, when my tom got out and was gone for a week.  The day I put his blanket outside, he was home within hours!<br>  <br>  2.5 months is quite a long time, so my idea may not work.  Probably, she got pregnant, had kittens, and someone has taken her inside, thinking she was a stray.......and now she has another HOME.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|0mb78CiWaa	She should be back by tomorrow morning. If not put some lost posters up with a picture of her. <br>  <br>  If she does not come back in the next few days.Try contacting your animal shelter too. They may have her or if they do get her, they will contact you.<br>  <br>  I hope she comes back.|`|e124e8765c4b0ed9c4d1ca5f0af5f848aa	Sorry sounds like your cat is gone!! If your cat is gone that long!!!<br>  <br>  Let this be a lesson that you shouldn't let cats outside! Unless they are supervisised, Security tagged or microchipped!|`|UNFxjNHkaa	You seem to be having a lot of issues with your animals today... I hope your bird is okay...<br>  <br>  As for the cat, is she spayed?  Sometimes they go away when they're in heat to go mate.
AA11901352	First you should not place a fish in a tank that isn't cycled.  Secondly fin rot mostly comes from POOR water quality.  Maintaining 25% water changes weekly with gravel cleaning is needed to maintain healthy tank and fish.  Yes he could have started the tail rot form the old tank.  Meds are not needed if you are keeping the tank clean weekly.  Howeve rit could come from a bacterial infection.  You should be sure prior to treating.  Looking clean to you isn't clean for the fish.  they don't need CLEAN water.  they need water that has beneficial bacteria, no ammonia no nitrites and low nitrates.  How did you move him?  Did you acclamate him to the new tank or just dump him in?<br>  <br>  Even going tank to tank the fish need to be acclamated no matte what
gwhutbkdaa	I use arm n Hammer and when its all balled up U can flush them .|`|cj31x3UMaa	It is not a matter of BEST, but personal preference. I am allergic to the dust from gravel type litters, perfumed litters & get headaches from the pine litters.<br>  <br>  IMHO - THE best is *Breeders Choice* from Australia, but in working out their USA marking & distribution they screwed over the breeders that had been supporting them for many years since 1st imported.<br>  <br>  Yesterdays News is a good enough 2nd choice for me & PetSmart pricing is close to (if not less than) what I used to pay for Breeders Choice.<br>  --------------------------<br>  If you only have 1 cat & are dumping the box daily, consider lining the box w/ newspaper & adding a bunch of shredded paper. Easy to clean up if the cat plays, a daily newspaper is enough to change & dump the box daily & you can ask a neighbor to save papers for you if you need more. VERY cheap!|`|jh00NAj3aa	It's expensive but I use the World's Best Cat Litter.  No chemicals, it's made out of corn.  I clean the litter out of the boxes once or even twice a day because I'm ultra sensitive to any odor, including the urine and feces in the litter box so if I can smell it, I clean it, and I have 4 litter boxes for 2 cats.  One of them doesn't strike the litter to cover their waste, he hits the outside of the litter box instead and the wall.  I leave the untouched litter alone.  Just try switching brands, and make sure you have at least one more litter box than what you need.  Cats usually have a favorite litter box.  Walmart has a cheap kitty litter, and before I switched, I got the kind at PetCo that you can refill in a 5 lb. bucket.  Good luck!|`|kZ5wWUg2aa	The cat litter which is crystals, even the urine doesn't smell with this type all you have to scoop is the poop. Also hooded little trays work well because they have a charcoal insert in the top which stops smells lingering around the house.<br>  <br>  I am from australia so i dont know whats available elsewhere :)|`|Emk4xuTuaa	I tried every cat litter at first, until I found one that she would actually use, which is Fresh Step.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	tidy cat works|`|ftvxAS3saa	PURINA TIDY CATS!!!|`|lTsDwY9Paa	I have 6 house cats and I work at a pet boarding facility so I know a lot about cat litter. I will only use Kitty Diggins (walgreen's brand) or Champion Breed (kmart brand). They both cost about $6 for a 14 lb container. The pieces are very small so they coat the feces better and cover the smell more effectively. I was sick last month and asked my sister to bring me some cat litter. She brought me Tidy Cat Multi cat and the smell was almost overwhelming. I used to use Arm & Hammer and it works ok for one cat, but its not the best.<br>  Those natural litters made from corn, old newspaper or pine are jokes. They do nothing to cover the smell and track everywhere. The Gem litters are the same and many cats won't use them because they don't like the texture.|`|w1lh1INHaa	In my and my four cats' opinion, wood pellets are the best.  The keep the odor down, less litter changing, and feces can be flushed down the toilet without and adverse affect to your septic or public sewer system.<br>  <br>  Pine pellets are sold at supermarkets and pet stores under the name of Feline Pine, for about 20 pounds for $12-15 plus tax.  Or, you can save a bundle of money and get wood stove pellets, which are sold in 40 pound bags for $6-7 no tax.<br>  <br>  Pine pellets not only made a great litter, but they are bio-degradable, which is excellent for the environment and the land fill and the oceans that cat litter gets dumped into.|`|0mb78CiWaa	Scented Fresh Step and Arm and Hammer work great. And so does scented Tidy Cats. <br>  <br>  If you get clumping litter it is better. You can scoop it out a couple times a day with-out having to dump out the whole litter box.|`|hetZz4c1aa	We like Dr. Elsey's Precious Pet.  You can buy it at PetSmart and I find the cost to be the same or cheaper than grocery store brands.  Excellent "smell" control, clumps well and the cats like it.<br>  <br>  good luck!

AA11887983	I would suggest talking to your vet,  and getting her into a good puppy class.  She is about the right age.  This behavior is not unheard of in a young dog, but it needs to be corrected while she is still young.  <br>  <br>  Get a referral for a good training class, and get her started.  That way, you can have her learn, and you can also learn the proper way to discipline her.|`|bPdqwkpPaa	Goldens can leave mom at 8 weeks.  <br>  <br>  Basically, from the point they get their puppy shots, they should be in puppy classes for basic training and socialization.  <br>  <br>  At 3 months, contact a GOOD trainer to ask them about what your next step should be. <br>  <br>  Where was she purchased?  Was it from a responsible breeder who breeds titled dogs?  If not, then it's probable that the backyard breeder didn't breed for temperament, and your puppy is suffering the results.  <br>  <br>  Either way, call a trainer to help you get through this before she's too big to control.  If the trainer doesn't think you can handle it, then it's best to contact Golden Rescue and give her up while she's still young enough to be adopted out easily.  <a href="http://www.grca.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.grca.org</a>|`|40pyDwTGaa	Give her a "pop" under the chin.

eiQigYLfaa	No. It needs to turn off at night so they can sleep. And to add to Mike P's answer about timers, you can get them at Wal Mart for 4 bucks, not 15.|`|rHwMf2P4aa	No. I use to have a bearded dragon for years. But what I did was switched it to a blue or red light at night to give it just that little bit of warmth. But no they do not need their heat lamp on all night long. The temperature call safely fall to 60 degrees at night but I never let mine get below 65.|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	no I use a 12 on 12 off schedule. If you are worried about night temps getting below 60 degrees you can run the red or black bulbs for extra heat or get a ceramic heat emitter. I do have to use these on a couple of my cages for warmth as I keep my temps down.|`|tc5A0vKDaa	No.  In fact, you shouldn't at all unless it is very cold in the room.  Bearded dragons actually "feel" light waves.  They will not go into as deep a sleep as they should with it on, unless it is a ceramic, but ceramic lights get very hot. What we do with our girl is put slate on the bottom of her tank.  It keeps the whole thing warm.

KEYgd73saa	Sounds like Ergasilus.  These are smaller than normal gill flukes and anchor worms, and tend to be greenish, which explains why it looks like plant matter.  They also cause inflamation, and in an area like the gills where there is a large amount of blood, this will cause excessive redness. You can use potassium permanganate dips (35 ml/gallon for 10-30 minutes), but formalin and/or malachite green baths (treating the whole tank for about a week) are more readily available, and generally easier to dose.

0mb78CiWaa	Personally I like cats. They are more independent and are not as much work.<br>  <br>  Dogs need a lot of work and time. If you are at work a lot of the day a cat would be better  than a dog.|`|QdQcAHqaaa	If you are away from home a lot and need a more independent creature, go with a cat.  If you are looking for a pet to go on excursions with you, get a dog.  Both pets are affectionate and sweet.  In general, pros and cons of cats are: they are less costly to feed and take to the vet, they do their business in a box so you don't have to worry about taking them out, they can be left alone for long periods of time with getting anxious; however, they are not animals that can roughhouse, you can't really take them anywhere public, they do not train easily, and they are not big enough to scare off an intruder if that's one of your goals.  Dogs are generally more sociable than cats (though not necessarily true), they can accompany you almost anywhere pets are allowed, walking/playing with them is a form of exercise, owning a dog is likely to lessen the chance your house will be robbed; on the flip side, if you are gone the whole day, you will need to make arrangements to have them walked, they cost a lot (even the little ones), they tend to take loneliness harder than cats, and they require socialization and training to make sure they don't become neurotic.<br>  Both pets are wonderful animals, and they both have been linked to improving owner health.  Good luck for you and your future pet!|`|dx2AepAuaa	dogs are alot of work. They have accidents until they can get trained. They also need alot of attention. If you want  an animal that is easy, I would suggest a cat. They don't have accidents if their litter box if cleaned regularly and they don't need to be babied all the time. I have a dog. Love her, but she has been a pain. Always have had cats and wish I had more!|`|133a80b8f446ced791ae790df571f049aa	Well it depends...<br>  <br>  Cons of a dog:<br>  With a dog you need to walk it every day on a schedule.  If you get a puppy you'll have to housebreak it.  Dogs are more expensive to obtain and care for.  Generally dogs are more high energy.<br>  <br>  Pros of a dog:  You can take it out places with you without people giving you a funny look.  You can make friends at the dog park.  It will give you a lot of exercise.  <br>  <br>  Cons of a cat:  You can't really wrestle with them, sometimes they claw stuff.<br>  Pros of a cat:  You can usually get a cat for free and they don't usually have that many medical emergencies.  You don't need to bathe them as often as a dog.  They are quiet and small, so they don't really get in your face when they want to play.  They don't require as much time/involvement as a dog but can still be just as affectionate.  Since they're small, they can share a bed with you.<br>  <br>  Personally I'm a cat person...|`|7obNke84aa	What kind of an insane question is that? Pick the dog. They're cuter and are more fun to play with. Cats smell, are really boring, and they scratch a lot!|`|rQgW7EaLaa	well i would get a dog their more playful!There more loving and just fun cats just sit around not really fun!|`|gEhVy5okaa	i would say a dog because they are more reliable , loyal and friendly! plus they (if they are trained good) won't make your house smell of  pets and urine and poop! <br>  <br>  with having a cat you have to deal with the whole litter box thing and having to change it all the time, plus in my experience every cat i had in the past turned evil and quit listening and eventually didn't even know there own name and was extremely mean to everyone!<br>  <br>  hope this helps you out, best of luck!|`|kzyf0ze1aa	Dog I would say but you may pick a cat if you would like a large dog i would suggest a Golden Retriever.If you want a small i would suggest a Westie  or a Shih-tzu or maybe a Yorki.The cat i would like is the Scottish Fold or the Bombay. Its your choice though.|`|TnlM7UYfaa	It really depends on your lifestyle. If you have a very busy schedule and have no time to walk a dog 5 times a day then cats make very sweet, fun, loving pets who love to cuddle and play and you don't have to walk them. If you have a lot of time then dogs are great too. But they are a big responsibility. Dogs are loyal, sweet, eager to please, and a lot of fun. Good luck!|`|RHx4vPvCaa	that depends on your life style. if you have to work a lot i would get a cat because they are eaiser to take care of. if you are at home a lot get a dog because they are more work. i hope you enjoy your new pet! :)|`|90R64mJOaa	Well, it depends on you.

Colour is Brown Mackerel Tabby.  <br>  <br>  And yes, the tabby pattern can have spots in it as well.  There's a variation of tabby called "Spotted Tabby" where instead of vertical stripes it's spots.  But the spotted pattern is all over the body.  Mackerel Tabby cats often have spots on their stomach (which are actually broken stripes) or scattered on the body.  This site shows the various tabby patterns - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tabby-types.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tabby-...</a>|`|8DCslWmMaa	Tabby is a color not a breed- many breeds can be tabby colored.<br>  Some tabbies are striped, known as 'Mackerel', and some come with a swirl bullseye type pattern, known as 'Classic' . Sometimes one will even be a mix of these.<br>  And they come in every color - even all black cats, you can see thier stripes when in the sun or thier coat gets faded by the sun. The hairs even have a different texture<br>  <br>  What you have is probably a Domestic Short Hair- a.k.a- a mutt-kitty.<br>  Very cute kitty, I had one just like her named Tiger Lily and someone stole her.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	She is a brown mackerel tabby,domestic shorthair ( mixed breed,alley cat,etc.),and yes,some tabbies have spots.I have a spotted tabby named Ruby.Here she is playing with her friend Batty<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n85/Luna810/PictureorVideo843.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n85/L...</a><br>  <br>  Edit: Though Ruby has some spots,technically she is still a mackerel ,or striped tabby,as is your kitty.Spotted tabbies have a different pattern.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	She is a domestic shorthair. Most cats we own are mixed breed domestic cats, not purebreds. If your cat has some similar features as a purebred cat which you've seen, it doesn't necessarily mean your cat is that breed. For instance, a shorthair cat that was born in America is not necessarily an American Shorthair cat. Just as not every black cat is a Bombay, and not every gray cat is a Chartreux. Also terms like calico, tortoise shell, tabby, and tuxedo are words used to describe the color and pattern; they are not breeds. <br>  <br>  A domestic shorthaired cat (DSH) is a cat fancy term used to describe a shorthaired cat that does not have a pedigree or belong to a recognized cat breed. The domestic shorthair should not be confused with the American Shorthair, which is a Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognized breed.<br>  Domestic shorthaired cats are characterized by a wide range of coloring and typically 'revert to type' after a few generations, which means they express their coats as a tabby. This can be any color or combination of colors. They also exhibit a wide range of physical characteristics and, as a result, domestic shorthaired cats in different countries tend to look different in body shape and size, as they are working from differing gene pools. DSH cats in Asia tend to have a build similar to a purebred Siamese cat or Tonkinese cat, while European and American varieties have a thicker, heavier build.|`|P7VdWn7baa	She is a Tabby very popular breed.|`|BvmOz6Xeaa	"Domestic Shorthair" aka no breed.<br>  <br>  Brown Mackerel Tabby.  Those saying "Spotted" tabby are wrong.  A spotted tabby has the entire tabby pattern of spots - not stripes with a spot here and there.  You might want to believe those that actually show their cats and know coat patterns - most people don't.<br>  <br>  Just because this person "said" their cat has spots doesn't make it Spotted Tabby.  Those are MACKEREL STRIPES in that first photo.  Case closed.  If I said my cat was a Persian but posted a pic of a Siamese - does that make my cat a Persian?<br>  <br>  edit: LOL BlackMoon - you're amusing.  I know Laura from shows and she's none of the things you say.  She drinks? LOL!  Yes, she has an occasional beer or a glass of wine and both of us are buzzed by the second glass.  But at least we're adults.  Grow up, little girl.  You've been reported for "harassing others".|`|E50u6IwRaa	Definitely Spotted Tabby!

OBci1DxQaa	It depends on the pet store.  Some work directly with chinchilla breeders so they can specify dates and colors.  Obviously, you'll save money if you skip the pet store and go right to the breeder.<br>  <br>  Larger pet stores will probably not do this, you'd need to look for a smaller one.<br>  <br>  You won't be able to get a chinchilla younger than 6 to 8 weeks as they are not weaned until then.  But two months is plenty young to work with them and develop their personality.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Most pet stores sell baby chinchillas that are between 2 and 4 months old. DO NOT get a chinchilla until you have done your homework. They may be cute, but they are very needy and require a lot of maintenance. They are not a pet you buy on a whim.|`|rH6UTFf5aa	Most pet stores sell chinchilla but if you get them from a breeder it will be way expensive. If don't have a  lot of time to play with them and take care of them you prob. shouldn't. They may be really cute but they are super high maintenance.
bDPVRtCNaa	Not in a ten gallon. <br>  <br>  The Senegal bichir requires at least a 48 inch tank. They grow about 20 inches, which is the length of the standard ten gallon aquarium. <a href="http://badmanstropicalfish.com/profiles/profile41.html" rel="nofollow">http://badmanstropicalfish.com/profiles/...</a><br>  <br>  Don't get fish unless you have a tank large enough for them to thrive in. A year is a very long time for a fish to be in a cramped environment, and will adversely affect their health.
dE5fs9yzaa	I think alot depends on the breeding genes they both carry...what did their parents look like? I would expect marbles with some Cambodian looking ones. Nice fish, by the way!

81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	You're responsible.  Even if your dog is on a leash and bites someone, you're responsible.<br>  <br>  Don't try and fight it.  You WILL lose.  Just pay the fine and be done with it and be glad you still have your dog.|`|024lJBZ4aa	Nope, you can't fight it.  You were in the wrong.  You dropped the leash, whether it was an accident or not, so your dog was not in your control.  The second strike against you is your dog bit someone.  So you need to be humble, own up to your dog not only being offleash but also badly behaved.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter whether or not there is a camera. <br>  <br>  a)  as you already can see, your Homeowners Assoc can fine you<br>  b)  the Homeowners Assoc can tell you to get rid of your dog<br>  c)  If your dog is not up to date on his rabies vaccine, you will have to quarantine your dog.  Also depending on the laws of your town/city, your dog can be confiscated and destroyed by animal control.|`|PM23RDycaa	Actually its not a lie. By the elevators is considered common area. Your dog was not in your control and thus "off leash" they have it on camera and they know he bit the janitor. Pay the fine and from now on keep a firm grip on the leash. You can ask to see the tapes but if there are cameras in the area which is happened you aren't going to be happy with what you see.|`|3zv2bbolaa	I don't know how enforceable the HOA rule is but in public, even if the dog is on lead and you drop it, you are liable because the dog must be under control at all times. <br>  <br>  They may have a case, but if you feel you want to fight it, consult your attorney.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Since your dog did bite a man & he can testify you didn't have control of dog, you don't have a good defense.  Pay the bill & be glad the incidence didn't cost you much more.|`|0e51HkpHaa	Pay up and be glad you are not being sued.|`|aCqSF87Raa	I would pay the fine - it may have been an accident and the dog may have been startled, but it IS up to you to keep the dog under control. <br>  <br>  You admit to the incident and "I dropped the leash" is not really a viable excuse (sort of sounds like something a teenager would say, to tell you the truth) especially since the dog is only 15 lbs!<br>  <br>  This is a very small fine - if your dog had been any closer to the guy's privates (ouch!), or had broken skin, or was any bigger you would be facing higher fines and the dog may have been seized as dangerous.|`|S9ZNGhqyaa	I have a 12 pound Papillon.  He doesn't really like strangers either.  If I were you, I would just pay the fine and be more careful next time.  Your dog was technically "off leash" when you weren't holding his leash.<br>  <br>  If you really don't want to pay the fine, you could make a case that the man scared your dog and they might let it go.|`|3eI0vYHgaa	Pay the fine! The fact is you let go of the leash, it's your responsibility to have control of your dog at all times. Be happy no one was seriously injured and $150 is all it's going to cost you!|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	You lost control of the dog, which is the same as being unleashed.  Pay the fine and move on.|`|xz1Eqm47aa	i think unleashed is basically the same as no one holding the leash. I would pay the fine and be a little more careful.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	You dropped the leash so your dog WAS off leash and the security camera probably has that on tape.  How can it be a lie when what they are saying is fact.  No point in trying to deny it.<br>  <br>  I would pay the $150 and not create a fuss.  Creating a fuss will bring you more trouble in the future if you intend to keep living there.  <br>  <br>  Afterall your dog did bite someone so it will be a lot worse for you and your dog if you make trouble over this.  They are well within their rights to sue you and you will be in more strife then than having to pay $150.|`|4SQx8smEaa	Because you did not have control of your dog you are liable...<br>  <br>  It really does not matter...your dog did bite someone.....you did not have controll of him....<br>  Just pay the fine....it could be a lot worse, the guy could even try to sure you if he wanted to...or have your dog taken away.<br>  <br>  <br>  And how do you know for a fact that there are no security cameras??|`|p7swtBYzaa	Be glad the guy your dog bit isn't suing, pay the fine, and keep hold of your dog securely from now on.<br>  There is evidence that he's a biter, so lay low, take great care it doesn't happen again or your dog could be impounded by Animal Services and you can be asked to move out.<br>  <br>  Dropping the leash or not having the leash - same thing, either way your dog was not secured.<br>  <br>  Be happy for small mercies - pay the fine and thank the guy for being so civilized about it.<br>  I would send him a nice basket of some kind of goodies just to keep him from reconsidering.|`|TTI1M4fVaa	I agree with the people above. By dropping the leash they can say he was not properly restrained. I would just pay the fine and be careful.

3zv2bbolaa	I am not sure how you came about acquiring a 5.5 week old pup, but this fellow was way too young to be released from his litter and siblings. He was not properly weaned and socialized, much less vaccinated or had enough wormings. <br>  <br>  He is also way to young to interact with your six month old pup, who is going to accidentally injure the pup if allowed to rough house. You need to keep them separated until that baby is at least 10 weeks old and then they can play with extremely vigilant supervision, possibly keeping the older pup on lead so you can immediately correct and separate them if things get too rough.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	5 1/2 weeks is too young for a puppy to leave it's mother and no responsible breeder would have let a puppy go so young. Take the puppy back to the breeder until it is 8 weeks old, and then consider if you want to get it back or not.   Your older puppy is probably just playing roughly and trying to get the puppy to play back, but the young puppy is most liely scared to death and has no idea how to play with a dog so much bigger than itself.|`|TyhHL4a7aa	I'm glad you asked. Like a lot of loving pet parents, you obviously didn't know not to dump a baby into the lion's den ... or in your case Husky hell. That is not how to introduce a new dog.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you meant well, but you cannot just bring a tiny puppy into an established household with any dog of any age. You have to introduce them slowly and carefully. <br>  <br>  It is your responsibility to protect the baby. Put the baby in a separate room, cover it with newspaper so it can be initially paper trained. Very slowly, consider crate training where you keep the puppy in the crate for extremely short periods of time (starting at 10 min.) and sit nearby, Gradually increase the time in the crate. And read up about crate training before you start.<br>  <br>  Your puppy needs a safe haven away from the much larger and more dominant dog. Of course, the husky is the alpha dog -- he was there first and he's older. This might change when the lab mix grows up.

If you are the midwife, without experience, make sure you have ample drinking water. Depending on how long the labour lasts, she will be thirsty. Eating the birth sacks and pushing is hard work. Not forgetting comforting her, because the Mum to be, with her first litter will be terrified, not understanding what the heck is happening to her. Remain calm and give her lots of reassurance.

The AKC waits until most of the bumps are worked out in the breed and a solid breed standard exists on top of breeding consistancy. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ratterrierclub.com/family/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ratterrierclub.com/family/ind...</a> is a great 'family tree' of the breed.  <br>  <br>  But please don't get me wrong.  They are not a yorkiedoodle type dog.  The breed was created very carefully, not thrown together in some puppy mill's breeding crate.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	If in doubt, then do a search on the AKC website to see if its a real breed.  If you don't find it, then more then likely its not a breed or its one of those designer dogs.<br>  <br>  But yes a Rat Terrier is a legit breed.|`|1Du4Rudvaa	It is a recognized breed.  I think the "rat" part in there name makes them seem like bad dogs, but they are very well tempered and active dogs.|`|m6qr8GVYaa	i think its half terrier half chihuahua|`|637af0df73292f4d1c8ec85214c9a369aa	Yes, the rat terrier is a pure bred dog that has been officially recognized by UKC but not the American Kennel Club (AKC).  It has, however, been recognized by the AKC for Foundation Stock Service and is expected to be given official full recognition in the upcoming years<br>  <br>  You can learn more about FSS status on AKC's website.  The Rat Terrier is listed near the bottom of the page with the rest of FSS list <a href="http://www.akc.org/breeds/complete_breed_list.cfm." rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/breeds/complete_breed...</a>|`|inA6ZLeAaa	Yes, and I have one and she is the best and smartest dog I have ever had. She likes to be with our weimarainer all the time an cries when she is not. She was crate trained and she will stay in her crate all day (door open) by her own choice until i get in bed at night because she sleeps with me. She never has gotten on my furniture, bothered anything as far as chewing- just an awesome dog. Loves my cats and kids too.|`|SXlEN1DIaa	Yes|`|2UNBPcxTaa	yes|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Yes, it is a pure recognized breed.  It's not a mutt "breed" like a morkie or a labradoodle.<br>  <br>  They are very rare so they are not recognized by all registries.
tCmwFJn5aa	You are having bad luck with your animals.  :(  Give it mouth to mouth / CPR.  You are joking right?|`|m1ypmbNKaa	If the bird is still choking it might not breath and could easily die.If i were you i would find an emergency pet clinic near you and get it there fast as possible.I dont know how your bird swallow the seeds that pretty strange.So get it there fast as possible before it dies it can die any minute if its still choking.Good Luck to YOU!!|`|zEnwj7IFaa	if he is still choking then idk. but if not then he's fine|`|UNFxjNHkaa	are you serious?  if the bird is choking, you need to call an emergency vet.
EJpiaCMQaa	Get him something with a bell on it, a ladder, or a preen toy.  I'm sure your sun conure will appreciate the toys.|`|6hnjifRZaa	Get him "foraging toys". They have "foraging systems" at Petsmart, get those. That will keep him busy throughout the day. You can also try toys that are made of different things like rope, wood, etc... so he has a variety of textures to play with.

VJs7JrIpaa	I don't think they really care, I think it has a lot to do with who they get the leadership from and who they see as dominant.  We have 2 male and 2 female dogs. All four will do as I say, at the same time all four will question my husbands authority. I am the dominant leader and provide them with everything, so it is vital to them to obey me. Even when he had a dog that was "his", she listened to me WAY more than him.  <br>  <br>  Previous abuse will influence some dogs to bond with the opposite sex of the person that abused them. But it's not a preference, so much as a fear.|`|mNBhYBAfaa	if you adopt a dog they will already have a predetermined 'favorite' of both gender and sometimes even race of people. my dog has never met a black person till recently and he freaked out. didn't know what this strange new thing was. 'new' pups just love their master no matter what. A dogs love is unconditional!|`|GkRRwzheaa	It Really depends on what the background of the dog is. If he/she is adopted, they may have been abused or somthing by a sertain gender, therefore they will avvoid the abusive gender. But if you got a new puppy with no abusive background, then no, it shouldnt have a preference.|`|6DxEDRReaa	no not unless they were previously abused. If a dog was previously abused by men they will probably be afraid of most men unless they really get to know them/ But generally no, it does not matter.|`|x5xMva3Raa	No, but they are sexist. Male owners are given more respect from dogs than female owners. I'm a female and my dog does tend to not obey me as good as he does to my bf and father.|`|S8AKs5s6aa	weeell idk about dogs, but birds(hehe i love them) i know that they do. Girls get along better with boy owners and vic versa.<br>  Im pretty sure its the same for most animals.|`|qSdrfUBraa	No way. would you care if your teacher was different.|`|eznL5Zwvaa	No.All they care about is that you love and take care of them.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Usually, no.  However, I have met some dogs who were abused by men and so feared all men, even ones they knew.|`|el8yX5q3aa	Nope..they expect you to be the pack leader though....<br>  <br>  In my family it is me...they don't listen to him at all..and they follow me all over. I think it is who they bond with when you bring them home.  I took care of them...still do everything for them...they are MINE!|`|KxjUim7yaa	Yes. Our Dachshund picked my husband as his owner at 6 weeks. he likes me. but he is the man's dog. The female is my girl, but like to sit on the husbands lap.Some dogs are afraid of men because of mistreatment or their voices.|`|bYU77eteaa	it makes a difference, of course, by nature... but as the owner a female can overcome it by being stern in her voice and presistant in her actions|`|NbvTyN7saa	Each animal like each human has their preferences based on needs and more typically based on experience.  The answer is individual in nature.|`|CDBRXtnLaa	some do before ive seen at the S.P.C.A where it says<br>  Perphers Females|`|uKW6HUSOaa	Most don't. But if a dog received negative treatment from a certain previous owner, s/he can develop some favoritism.|`|Lt9AmXVeaa	No they care about who your energ bodylanguage and about you being the packleader.|`|R2pyXBzCaa	It depends if you got it and if it was like in a bad house hold before then it could be. but if its a puppy or something usually not|`|yo65rDLDaa	nope its all about your bodylaungage dogs read that over voice pitch and gender|`|SXlEN1DIaa	Sometimes they do.Usually  not.|`|JXAgD52Aaa	no but some dogs are drawn to certain genders|`|iLKtzK0jaa	dont know probably not X_X|`|Gr6Xe1gGaa	No.
m1ypmbNKaa	Anything below 35 degree Fahrenheit the bird shouldnt be kept outside and say its 40 degree F i would cover the cage with a lot of towels.Thats what i did with my cockatiel covered in 3 layer of towels.|`|BG0z9rYOaa	I believe that there is no problem with this as long as adequate shelter is provided.  Bird houses and trees with dense foliage should do the job.  I live in sunny Scotland and know of outdoor aviaries with budgies.  I believe they should be fine although if temps drop below freezing I would cover with polythene to protect the birds.|`|mGG1GkDZaa	i have to disagree i have a few budgies out side in my avery along with ring necks myna birds parrakeet's i find if you can put them in at the beginning of spring they acclimatize themselves to your weather i live in the uk our weather is up and down all year,i do have a small heater in my shed where they can go if it gets too cold.so far i have had them out side for over 6 years and no problems as long as there is no drafts where you put them.|`|o3nNm1iAaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  Is it cold where you live? If yes then you cannot put him out. If it is warm then go ahead. It was winter and it was very cold, I left my window open by mistake when my budgie was in his cage. He froze to death. Learn from my mistakes.|`|OyNJTWaiaa	No....birds even have trouble here in Australia when it get to a low 4-5 degrees centigrade and Colorado get way colder than that.|`|10zHV2thaa	no they die because it has to be around 70 degrees for them to live|`|Gr6Xe1gGaa	No. Parakeets original home is in Australia and it is usually hot there. They need to be in a temperature of 70 degrees. Especially not in Colorado where it snows.|`|DJa2wS86aa	some but not all when its below20 they probably will freeze not Shure about Australia's temps but its probably cold there too,in your neck of the woods i wouldn't pot then out|`|p2pE0Fpwaa	No, you should not even put them by an open window in the summer|`|ytHVAZ0saa	NO
4SQx8smEaa	Take him in ASAP...and post up pictures of a found cat...is he wearing a collar??<br>  If no one claims him he is yours...<br>  ...Did you try yo talk to your parents? That may be okay with it...just until you find a new home for him.<br>  Just make sure that he does not come in contact with your cat with out being vet checked...becuase out door cats are more likley to carry dieases.|`|BCgp7GTpaa	craigs list or call the SPCA|`|e124e8765c4b0ed9c4d1ca5f0af5f848aa	Umm, YOu can call a non kill shelter to pick him up!!!|`|GSkA8wh9aa	How old is the kitten?<br>  Try and take a photo of him and make a FOUND sign. Put them up with in a six block area of your home.<br>  If he is old enough he may survive the winter and you can keep him as an "outside" cat, but you must still bring him to a vet to be checked out, vaccinated and neutered.<br>  I would still mention him to your parents if you haven't already.|`|3CQb6PSFaa	Keep him in your house and put up signs, if no one claims him put an ad in the newspaper for a free cat. Who knows, m/b u can convince you parents to let you have another cat... you know... keep the other one company. :)|`|AA10500537	put an add in the newspaper.<br>  or take to to animal shelter|`|4yZ6t2WEaa	most likely he has a home.<br>  i have 3 different cats that come to my house that none of my family knows. we put our catfood outside and other cats come to eat it. we have a kitten that actually lives under our house that we don't know where it came from. and also, i have seen my cat at other peoples houses, and i know i wouldn't want my cat taken from me.|`|kNYDHZqAaa	If he's a kitten that's constantly outside without a collar, he probably doesn't have an owner. Maybe you're parents would be open to taking in another cat? It never hurts to ask. Or maybe they'd agree to take him in temporarily while you find it a home? I'd check the no-kill shelters in your city, even if they can't take him in they could probably put up a courtesy listing if you could watch him until he finds a home. I found a sweet stray cat once, and put word out that a nice cat needed a home. Someone put up a sign in a vets office and he found a home. It's nice of you to help him out :)

If you're just looking for a pet, a breeder will probably sell you one for like five bucks, which I think is a good deal - you can get a young, healthy cavy with a known background and not be in the dark about what kind it is. Many breeders probably wouldn't mind answering any questions about cavies you have, either. <br>  you can get a 32 oz. waterbottle at wal mart, and probably a food bowl too. if you order from KW you can get pretty much anything.|`|5SN8R3GEaa	If you get it from a pet store, then it will cost around 25 dollars. Getting one from a shelter will be around 35 or 40 dollars. Getting one from a breeder costs a lot, don't get one from there unless you plan to enter it in contests.<br>  <br>  The supplies without the cage wont cost a lot either, depending on where you buy. It is a good idea to look at a few different stores to see which one has the best prices on supplies.<br>  <br>  Keeping guinea pigs is not very costly either, the most you'll be spending is 20 dollars whenever you run out of hay. Other than hay the only other item you need to buy regularly is the seeds, which is about 10-15 dollars for a medium bag, depending on where you buy it.

As long as you train a Pomeranian well you will have a good dog.

bPdqwkpPaa	It's a mutt.  With a mutt, they only come from bad breeders with poor stock, so there's a much larger chance that the dog will have a poor temperament and be un healthy. <br>  <br>  If you want a mutt, visit your local shelter.

Hide the carrier in a bathroom or other small room, then carry him in there and SHUT THE DOOR!<br>  <br>  Turn the carrier UP ON END, with the door facing up.  Pick him up in your arms, holding his front legs with one hand and his butt with the other.  SET HIM DOWN INTO the carrier (butt first) and QUICKLY shut the door.  NOW, you have him in the carrier!  Don't open it until you're at the vet, in the exam room with the door closed and the vet IN THERE!  You'll probably need a few more hands to get him back into the carrier after the visit!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps............Good luck.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	if you want to help him - you should take him to the vet.  If he's limping he could have broken or sprained his leg.

We have 5 ferrel (wild) cats running around our house and one of them was limping too. There wasn't any external signs of ANYTHING though, just limping, after a while she stopped limping but she won't sit on that leg. Wait and see and if she doesn't get better in about a week or two weeks, get a large squrriel/ animal trap to get it. That is what we used to get them all their shots and to get them fixed. Put something tasty in it too like tuna. I'm sure it will enjoy that if it is a stray!|`|AA11148603	Sometimes the wounds can be an abscess. If it is pussing out all the time and crusting up then it me be an abscess. When my cat doesn't want to be picked up and we have to go to the vet. (does not like the carrier). I will take a towel and put it over him, wrap it around his neck like a cape with his head exposed. this will protect you from getting hurt. Then I have someone in the car with me to hold him so he doesn't thrash around. This seems to calm him from being stressed and yelling. He will start to purr from the closeness and warmth after a few minutes. If it is an absences then be careful with the HP. It may eat away at the cats tissue. They are very sensitive.
uBFhKXgHaa	Your kitten is smarter than your vet. My advice is to put your kitty on an all wet diet and ditch the dry entirely. Realize that vets get next to no nutritional training during their veterinary schooling. They know very little about pet nutrition. <br>  <br>  Contrary to popular belief, wet/canned food is actually healthiest for cats.<br>  <br>  The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/</a>  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)<br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canned_food.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne...</a> (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=whycatsneedcannedfood" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a> (Why Cats Need Canned Food)<br>  <a href="http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bpo_ch4.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...</a> (The Dry Food Crisis)<br>  <a href="http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.htm" rel="nofollow">http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...</a> (Max's House: Feline Nutrition)<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=doesdryfoodcleantheteeth" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a> (Does Dry Food Clean the Teeth?)<br>  <br>  Another option to get cats to drink more would be a cat fountain. Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.<br>  <br>  You'll also want to make sure you're feeding a high quality cat food.<br>  <br>  <br>  Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.<br>  <br>  Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.<br>  <br>  Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul and Felidae.<br>  <br>  Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:<br>  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food<br>  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food<br>  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food<br>  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Gena, without even addressing the rest of your nonsense, I really can't believe that you lumped Innova (one of the highest quality dog foods on the market currently) with crap like Iams, Purina, and Science Diet. It just... boggles the mind. Have you even compared the ingredients of these foods? If you had, you'd see that Innova is far superior in quality to that junk. Innova was the ONLY high quality food you actually listed in your 'high quality foods' list.<br>  <br>  Darksong~|`|aP4bkYOCaa	Actually, your vet is wrong. The dry food/better teeth thing is a myth and wet food is perfectly fine for your cat, especially since he is male and therefore more prone to urinary issues.

The data we are presented with and then pass on to our clients come from professional veterinary nutritionists who spend their lives researching exactly how much of what our animals require.  (Not from pet food representatives, although we do get cheap food from various companies trying to get in our good graces)  <br>  <br>  <br>  (2) Your vet is not wrong about dry food being better for your cat's teeth.  The idea is that the action of having to break up the food scrapes plaque from the teeth. (Basically the same idea behind dogs chewing on bones.) Also, wet food tends to get stuck in between teeth more easily than dry.  The stuck food is a great source of nutrition for bacteria and sets up the chance for disease.  Having said that, though, it's not a huge difference.  A lot of what predisposes animals to dental disease has to do with their jaw confirmation, not their diet.<br>  <br>  (3) The water content in canned food does contribute to a cat's hydration status, but cats don't NEED wet food for water.  They need fresh water in a bowl every day regardless of the type of food you feed.<br>  <br>  Now on to actually addressing your question:<br>  <br>  Your cat likely prefers wet food because he has grown up eating it, it tastes better due to a higher fat content, is (in theory) fresher since you open a new can every meal, and has a mouth feel that he likes.  Cats are surprisingly picky about the way food feels in their mouths, which (as you are finding out) can make transitioning from squishy canned foods to hard kibble nearly impossible.  If your cat has never been exposed to kibble, he may not even recognize it as food.  The burying behavior you see could be his way of playing with it.  If he eats the kibble after he has buried it, though, it is a sign that he has at least begun to accept the kibble. In this case, you could keep increasing the ratio of dry to wet food until he was on a kibble-only diet.  Cats are notoriously stubborn, but will adapt if given enough time.  Just make sure he is eating SOMETHING since hunger strikes can lead to liver damage and ultimately death in cats.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to feed your cat dry food, there is no real reason to do so.  Dry food is generally recommended by veterinarians because of its convenience; it doesn't dry up, rancidify, or cause a huge sloppy mess like wet food can.  It's basically foolproof to feed.  Yes, dry food can help scrape accumulated gunk from your cat's teeth but, just like humans, in order for a cat's mouth to be remain healthy, his teeth need to be brushed daily and professionally cleaned as needed (never more than once a year under normal circumstances).  If you're not brushing your cat's teeth, old food and plaque is going to accumulate regardless of the type of food you feed.  So, keep feeding wet food if you want.  On a dry matter basis, there are actually fewer calories in wet food so (if fed in healthy proportions), it could help keep your kitten lean.  Contrary to a growingly popular belief, it won't reduce your cat's risk of diabetes compared to feeding dry food, though.  Research has shown that cats easily tolerate the carbohydrate levels found in dry foods, even though they cannot break them down for energy.  Kibble does not predispose to any type of metabolic problems on its own as far as modern medical science can tell.  If you want to get the best of both worlds, you could try feeding the kibble from a tartar-control diet to your cat as treats to help with dental health.  Your vet should have free samples, so you don't need to run out and buy a whole bag to try it.<br>  <br>  Just make sure that you are feeding a high quality food (Iams, Innova, Purina, Science Diet...) since grocery store brands tend to be less stringent about the source and quality of their ingredients, their canning procedures, and their nutritional sufficiency/ safety studies.  All these factors can lead to toxicity issues which (since grocery store brands also tend to be harder to get in contact with) you rarely find out about until it is too late.  When it comes to cat foods, you get what you pay for.  Make sure the protein content is high, the ash content is low, and taurine is supplemented, and you should be fine.  If your vet gets snippy about you feeding wet food, just remind him/her that the more tartar that accumulates in your cat's mouth, the more often you'll have to bring him in for a cleaning so the clinic is actually making money on the deal. :-)<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Gena|`|Mq6B3VSjaa	I am astonished at the number of ignorant people giving you stupid advice designed to kill your cat.<br>  <br>  Never give a cat fat drippings.<br>  <br>  Nevever, ever, ever moisten dry food -- there is already bacteria on dry food and it flourishes when wet -- after 5 minutes there is enough bacteria to make a human sick, and if it wasn't that a cat has a more resilient digestive tract, would make a cat sick also.  If you want Irritable Bowel Syndrome when your cat gets older, then, by all means, moisten wet food.<br>  <br>  Fish?  A little as a treat now and then, but fish is not good for cats otherwise it would be natural prey for them.  Fish has high levels of mercury which a cat can't tolerate, is high in magnesium (not good for urinary issues), and prevents important potassium absorption.<br>  <br>  Feed your cat wet food, and you can leave a little dry out for free feeding.  Free feeding dry is the ONLY way that dry food even remotely helps clean teeth, because that is usually the only time a cat chews.<br>  <br>  Think about it....if you let your cat revert to a wild state, what would it eat?  It wouldn't fish.  It wouldn't be chasing corn or gobbling up wheat.  It would be eating moist meat.<br>  <br>  Look for a food that has real ingredients like chicken or turkey.  By products can be anything from hooves and beaks to intestines. <br>  <br>  I think people stick up for dry food because it is convenient and cheap to them.  Or, they are too stupid to be able to do some research, think for themselves, and put unjustified faith in someone who has no real training in pet nutrition.   Real cat lovers simply do not feed their cats a diet of dry.  They know better.|`|NbvTyN7saa	Your vet is mistaken and is basing their info on outdated practices.  Dry is not better for cats. They say that it helps with tartar control but it doesn't as the pieces are not big enough to be chewed in a way that rids the cat of tartar.  It is like saying eating an oatmeal cookie helps you with your tartar control.  <br>  <br>  Listen to your animal.  Being so young, they can in many instances still be nursing if with their mom so you can either soften their kibble with either some water or goat's milk (they don't do well on cow's milk) or switch to wet food.  Either way the food given should be specifically kitten food for the higher nutritional concentrates a growing kitten needs.  <br>  <br>  My cat eats 70% wet an 30% kibble.  Each animal is a different being and great generalizations across a species is not a good thing.  Your animal will guide you as to what they need.  <br>  <br>  I'd focus feed them wet and let them graze on the kibble with lots of water available to them at all times.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps|`|eRX96A73aa	My 2 year old cat just had 6 bladder stones removed from eating dry food. I would always keep dry food out for him, and it ended up almost killing him.<br>  They say that your cats diet should be at least 50% canned food and 50% dry food. Although my cat's urinary tract may be more sensitive than others, my vet and emergency vet do not recommend dry food at all. It causes crystals in the urinary tract and cause cats and dogs a lot of pain. My cat suffered from Urinary Tract infections for the last year and a half. I had no idea it was the food I was feeding him.<br>  Anyway, for your kitten, to get him to eat and like his dry food. Buy a feeder from petsmart and leave the dry food out all the time. Don't feed him canned food for maybe 3 to 5 days. I promise, he will get hungry and that dry food will look pretty good to him. <br>  After he starts eating the dry food consistently. Bring back the canned food. Half a can or a full can daily depending on how much he eats. He will most likely eat the dry food during the day and then wait for the canned food for dinner. <br>  Also, to keep urinary problems bay, I really recommend a drinking fountain for your kitty.

Science Diet. actually hard food causes cats to get crystals in their urinary system because they do not properly hydrate. most of their water intake is from soft food, without it most cats will not drink enough to flush these nasty crystals from their system, causing infections and in some cases death. i'd say if your cat wants the soft food, give it to him. they make other things to clean their teeth, btw, hard food has never been proven to be a great cleaner for their teeth anyway...

If there isn't one in your area, the only thing you can do on your end, is make sure your dog is leashed or contained in a fenced area when outside.<br>  <br>  You and your neighbors can make up a petition to your town about enforcing the speed limit, setting up radar traps or something, but they may not agree to it.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Sweetie, I'm very sorry about your dog.<br>  <br>  But cars have a right to be on the road, your dog does not.

Though people should not be speeding, you need to be responsible for your dog, and not blame them.  Lucky for you the person who hit your dog did not come after you for damages to their vehicle.

The chief reason why Bubonic Plague (The Black Death) wiped out a third of the population of western Europe in the 14th century is that rats that stowed away on ships returning from Asia carried the disease and it was a crime to own a domestic cat at the time!

OyNJTWaiaa	Oh dear. You should go into breeding with more knowledge and preparation than you have.<br>  <br>  1. They NEVER start incubating the eggs from the first egg laid. So your expectations there are wrong. They begin to incubate the egg partway through the clutch at around egg number three.<br>  <br>  2. If she tried to break it, it may well have been due to your anxiety being transferred onto the hen and you OVER CHECKING the nestbox.  Breaking if eggs is due also to you not preparing her for you to check the nestbox by lightly tapping on the outside of the nestbox BEFORE you open it to check. <br>  <br>  3. How old is your bird....birds being bred TOO YOUNG often do silly things with their eggs. Wait until they are 12 months old before breeding to be sure they have fully grown and arent robbing their own growing bones of essential calcium. If your birds are under 12 months remove the nestbox and WAIT till they are old enough. <br>  <br>  4. You removing the egg and handling it has transferred bacteria to the egg. Do not touch eggs with your hands unless you absolutely have to. You actually would have been fine if you hadnt over checked her nest and removed the egg. <br>  <br>  5. You do not have to do anything to warm the egg as it is nothing at this stage until the mother has begun to incubate and she wasnt at that stage yet.<br>  <br>  NOW............put that egg in a safe place ( no heat ) and wait until your hen has laid her next egg.....two days after the first egg. Then put the first egg back into the nestbox.  Try not to get anxious and upset the mother.<br>  Read this article I wrote....<a href="http://forums.budgiebreeders.asn.au/index.php?showtopic=13358" rel="nofollow">http://forums.budgiebreeders.asn.au/inde...</a><br>  and this excellent article also from my budgie forum  <br>  <a href="http://forums.budgiebreeders.asn.au/index.php?showtopic=22068" rel="nofollow">http://forums.budgiebreeders.asn.au/inde...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  **  Very few female budgies know if there eggs are fertile especially at this stage and they certainly dont go around trying to break the eggs because "they know" they arent fertile. They arent that smart. Many a hen bird has thrown out eggs with live chicks in them....they just arent that clever ...really. <br>  Its only when a hen bird has sat on the eggs far too long and they havent hatched that they figure it out and throw them out.<br>  Candling ( putting a light behind the egg ) is useless at this stage as the egg has to be at least 5 days old to tell.<br>  Warming it at this stage is a bad move. Follow my previous advice and I am happy to advise you further if you need help.|`|MU453gLqaa	If you do not have a male bird also the egg is infertile and will not hatch. But the female will still lay and maybe sit and guard the egg. If she did not there is probably something wrong with the egg. She will lay more. Just throw the egg away.|`|m1ypmbNKaa	If the parakeet is mocking the bird and trying to break it that means the egg is not fertile so there is no chance that the egg will hatch you will have to wait threw out the year again they will lay more dont worry just be patient and wait.|`|qqgXDogYaa	do you have a male too. sometimes the female will break an egg if she know nothing is in it. you should look it up on the net. some websites tell you that if it floats in water then....Im not sure if its not fertile. again I am not sure. hold it up to the Light to see if there is anything in there. but again if you bird tried to break it must mean there isn't going to be born.<br>  by chance if there is you just keep it warm in something soft. <br>  when it hatched they are really small it might be hard to feed it. at a pet store they have special feed for baby parakeet just ask a store worker about it.|`|lW442BUsaa	If she doesn't try to warm it it's probably infertile in which case there's no point of trying to keep it.
NevKx5fzaa	YES i actually have the zebra print one and it's AWESOME!!!! i think it is very nice exept it doesn't have a strap to hold on to... but if u dont mind that it's perfect! it fits nearly all horses! I hope i could help!!|`|BI1GbIZUaa	I've used one like this before. I bought a suede one. It's much nicer to use because it really keeps you from slipping at all. I borrowed different kinds of bareback pads before spending the $60 on one and I opted for the suede one. Maybe someone you know has different kinds you can borrow and try. Or just make sure that you can return it if it doesn't work.|`|EQvAbyvcaa	This is a very "cosmetic" pad but not durable or practical for a more serious riding endeavor.  My pad is topped out with roughout suede and the bottom is medical felt so it does not slip.  Also, rigging is leather with neoprene cinch.  It is a great pad and I should never need another one, it will never wear out.  Mine is available at Parelli.com if you want to take a look.  Great pad.|`|R5nXDuHmaa	every bareback pad ive ever used slips, but especially the fleece ones. if your gonna get one id get a suede one, or just not got one at all. i actually stay on better that way.|`|1eiPSIydaa	Polyester and Nylon... hmmm.  Sounds sweaty to me.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	OOh i have never used those, but i would love to get one.<br>  maybe for cold weather riding where you dont want to tack (too cold, it might crack or take too long.) because it'd be VERY warm, so in warm weather, i suggest against it.<br>  Its really cute though.
LAXxaxAZaa	I have 3 beagles. One doesn't do anything when she gets shots. The other two whine a little when the needle goes in, but that's it.<br>  <br>  Since she's young, I would except her to whine. She might try to lay down, too.|`|bIaywrBCaa	even my tiny chihuahua pups hardly fuss at all after a shot. Adult dogs usually have no reaction at all like they do not even feel it. She should be fine.|`|xi9amEG2aa	My dog gets super excited because she has strangers paying attention to her and petting her...giving her tons of treats, wagging her back half off.  She does kinda flinch whenever she get the shots or if they have to take blood...but they usually have a couple people there to hold them still, just in case.  Plus, you can go in the little room with them to keep the dog as calm as you can  haha.  <br>  <br>  If this is her first vet visit (which I hope it isn't) then she might be a little freaked out.  If she does try to bite, they can always put a muzzle on them, which doesn't harm them.  It just protects the vets from getting bitten.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -<br>  Well love, I think she may yelp...but although my yorkie will yelp when hurt or she thinks someone might be stepping too close to her paws...she does not yelp for her shot.  She does get a bit nervous so the vet scoops her up and loves on her some first.  She chit-chats with her while the whole process is taking place.  I just tell her to sit and hold her (she doesn't move) so she doesn't slide on the metal table.  It takes only a second and before I can get in there to love her the vet has her again telling her how great she did and has a little treat for her.  Although she does not eat treats...she likes to be offered on and takes it like a treasure.  Beagles are wonderful dogs...I am sure with your encouragement she will do great.  I often take mine (the ones I train as well) to the pet store to walk a bit or just for a ride... whatever it is that they especially like that way they don't relate the car with a shot.  My little one loves going to the vet...we stop in off and on just to say hi to the person at the desk.  Inevitably everyone makes it out for a snuggle.  She just finished walk(riding) 1000 miles with me on Wednesday.  I have a stroller for her and the gang for when they tire out.  Dogs are so great!!  Don't sweat it.  I am sure she will do fine...we get more nervous and upset than they do.  After all these years I still feel anxiety just like you do...it's a little thing called love.  :)|`|q0vKbocHaa	she will be fine until the needle goes in, then she may freak out a little bit, but it doesn't hurt anymore than a fly biting them or something, so it shouldn't be too bad.|`|3p6wp7DYaa	It'll be over before she realizes there is a needle in her leg! :) Just make sure to keep her calm and make it a pleasant experience up to that point.|`|azcwMiO8aa	My male beagle could not stand any pain (he thought), and would cry and fuss over his shots like they were killing him.  By the time he was about six he got over it!  Then he was a big enough boy to handle arthritis, and finally the pain of the inoperable huge tumor under his rib cage.  Are all beagles such silly babies for the first half of their lives?<br>  It helps to laugh at them a little and, this seems weird but it works, yawn at them while you are waiting at the vet.|`|tfH0B9Usaa	As long as your calm, she'll stay calm with you.   Female beagles are easier than the male beagles.  My Female beagle was attack by are neighbors dog. When she went to the vet my husband said that she did good for them.  She had two deep marks.  She's fine know and she going to have all puppies next week. Least 5 of them.  She thought that the mutt was going to hurt me and my child.  But my kid was already on the bus.  Droopy torn up his face alittle.  It's part pitt bull and his owner could only say is sorry.  Witch wasn't good for me.  That dog is a mean dog.  He almost bit some one too.|`|dEk2KNksaa	She will probably have that same reaction... a quick scream and try to get away and then she'll be fine. If she has some loose skin around her neck she may not even really feel it. I had a min pin who would get all dramatic and let out a good scream but my puggle and my dachshund mix don't even seem to feel it.
NbvTyN7saa	Really good question.  It generally means that they end product was not tested on animals.  The individual ingredients might have been tested on animals by another company but not the company of the end result product.  <br>  <br>  For the most part, animal testing for things like cosmetics are way, way down in Europe and North America.  Hard core companies that are very environmental or vegan in nature will probably not buy ingredients from sources that might have tested ingredients on animals.|`|fZCfJWpOaa	Huh, that's funny wording.  "The finished product was not tested on animals", probably means that something that went into creating the finished product used animal testing.<br>  <br>  I know my St. Ives bottles just plainly state: "This product was not tested on animals".  I'd think any other wording would be trying to dart around the truth. :/
AA11736483	The Omega 3 is one of the few things that is safe to use at home on the cat. But I don't think that will cure the cat. It's interesting reading your question. It sounds like the cat has the same symptoms that the dog has. It may be possible that the dog brought a virus with him and now the cat has it. Many shelter animals come with contagious conditions, parasites, etc. You probably should has isolated the dog while treating him before letting him roam in your house. Your poor kitty probably needs some antibiotics from the vet.
hC4Z8HIbaa	I have included a link below to a thread in a rat forum that I am a member of that has links to different ways to build your own cage. (And also check out the rest of the site It has tons of great information about anything rat related. I am a member there and I recommend it to all rat owners.)<br>  <br>  A bin cage is OK as a temporary cage, but I definitely wouldn't house a pair of rats in there permanently. They would have the potential to chew on the exposed edges of the plastic, but it doesn't necessarily mean they will. It will mostly depend on how you make the cage and whether or not your rats are chewers. If you want to make your own cage, I suggest not using the bin design (called 'Plastic tub' in the thread below). I have used the design called "storage bin." It is a different concept, which you will understand when you check out the links. The storage bin design allows you to be more creative. When picking a storage bin to use, try to pick something with a large floor area that is also shallow, like an under the bed storage container. This will give them the area they need with the ability to add levels, and will not give them a "fish tank" sort of bottom. In case you aren't aware, fish tanks are bad to keep rats in because they provide poor ventilation and allow amonia to build up. Even though the top of you cage will be open air, the place where the rats pee the most would still lack proper ventilation. I have also included below a rat cage calculator, so you can judge how big to make your cage. As a rule of thumb, a single rat needs at least 2 cubic feet of space. Because rats should live in at least same sex pairs, you should have double that space.|`|ak9DrBSwaa	I love bin cages - for HAMSTERS. <br>  <br>  I don't think there's be anywhere near enough room in one to humanely house a pair or trio or rats. In a pinch, they might serve well as a temporary hospital cage, but I think there'd be much better options as a permanent cage for rats.|`|BWez86Ldaa	This is a very bad idea. Bin cages are generally used for evil feeder breeders. Ammonia builds up in these cages (yes, even with a mesh top) and causes respiratory problems. Rats love chewing plastic, so more than likely they would chew out of a plastic bin.|`|eSe4a2Qaaa	If its wooden, your rats will most likely chew out. <br>  Its not their fault though, they love to chew and would probably do it without even realizing by doing it they would be escaping.
g5ti6Bviaa	Don't do Animal Control or Pound. Same thing and they will die. <br>  <br>  Don't panic. They are young yet and make sure the Mother is nursing them. Keep an eye on them. Give it time.<br>  <br>  Put them on a waiting list with any No-Kill Shelters that do not charge. <br>  <br>  Also, let people know around you about the 4 kittens and that they are healthy. People will take them in if they are healthy.

NbvTyN7saa	It can be so many things.  It can be a nervous thing, an allergic rash, a tumour, a bug bite, the list is endless.  The vet will be able to better judge.  Make sure that you let them know that they lick a lot and drink a lot of water.  Those are not normal things and can indicate a food allergy or kidney issue.|`|6098ebd9c2c175997bc815b09ad17e01aa	These spots can be due to self trauma, although the most common inciting factor for this would be itchiness. A few cats appear to develop these due to obsessive-compulsive behavior, a situation sometimes referred to as "psychogenic alopecia".  To determine if self-trauma is occurring some vets use an Elizabethan collar to prevent self damage. This doesn't give a clear idea of why the problem is occurring but it can rule out hairloss that is occurring without the cat's help. If that doesn't help, skin biopsies can be helpful in determining the cause of skin problems in many cases. <br>  <br>  I do not pursue a diagnosis|`|9MtL3L6Caa	Well...the cat might be stressed about something and keeps chewing that spot.

I don't understand why in the world they would get one puppy.....let alone two.  They already have 8 whiny kids...and now they're adding two 'babies'?  That's just insane.  She'll probably end up either having to give them away, or chaining them up outside being that she probably wont have ANY time to train them properly.|`|qEn157Ppaa	Kate said she doesn't have experience with dogs. They may become outside dogs, which would be sad.  I predict the dogs will be rehomed within a year. TLC should encourage them to take the dogs to training classes, which of course would be filmed and aired.  It would be great for others to watch and see, so more people could learn about the value of bonding with a dog through training, the time involved with getting a new dog, and how necessary it is to train a puppy right from the beginning!|`|PzbRJrTKaa	yeahh me too i hope, but dogs are messy and kate is a neat freakk. they are so cutee. but whyy wouldn't she let the kids name them? i like nala though the name is pretty|`|NkHU8tEJaa	They need more mouths to feed like they need holes in their heads.|`|d4ed95bed4c328fffaf810f911eaa905aa	god i hope not, high drive working dogs are NOT the breed for that household....|`|EtWP9mSMaa	i absolutly love that show but i havent seen that one. i hope she doesn't it would be so cute having the kids play with the puppies. but yeah i can see her kickin them out if they get messey. i hope she doesnt though:)|`|Med7VQI7aa	If they could handle 8 kids, they could handle 2 puppies.

ak9DrBSwaa	Hamsters will destroy an unhealthy pup and eat a dead one. It's likely the result of an inexpierenced too young momma or poor breeding (neither of those is your fault obviously).  I wouldn't worry about the others, there's really nothing you can do that will prevent it if its going to happen it will even under the best care.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't touch the babies until they are fully furred, eyes open and wandering about the cage. It's normally around 2 weeks. <br>  <br>  This is also when you can do the first cage cleaning with realtive safety. General rule of thumb - momma never sees you touch the babies this young. Take momma out first, then take babies out and put them in a seperate container. Clean cage, babies back in first, then momma.<br>  <br>  You didn't mention which species of dwarf, but here's the weaning ages:<br>  Campbells - 21 days<br>  Winter White - 20 days<br>  Robos - 28-30 days<br>  Chinese - 21 days<br>  <br>  REMEMBER - shortly after that get them sorted into same sex cages to prevent an unwanted litter. <br>  <br>  Make sure the pups can reach the water bottle nozzle - you may have to lower it.<br>  <br>  Pet stores selling pregnant hamsters. This is a frustrating practice. Some pet stores near us sort by colour rather than gender (how stupid is that?). Some here (petsmart) only carry one gender which is a good way to prevent their customers from having accidental babies.|`|sddddotPaa	If the mother did eat her baby, it was out of love. If hamsters know that one of their babies had a disability, she will eat it. Just so that it doesn't have to suffer. <br>  <br>  Also, this happens alot of times and many different pet stores. Don't stop going to this store just because your hamsters had babies. This isn't the first time it's ever happened.<br>  <br>  I would say to take them out and hold them about 23 days after birth ( You can do the math lol)  Not until then though!|`|f12MT3Rwaa	Awwwww! poor hamster!<br>  <br>  All i can say is feed it enough!<br>  <br>  Can u please answer  my question!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226175337AARbcRw">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|HIwJFtNlaa	Well, you probably know that mother hamsters/rodents eat their babies soon after birth and it's actually quite common. I don't think you need to be worried about the others being eaten, I think they should be okay. <br>  But that's all I can answer, sorry.<br>  good luck though!
wADItPRyaa	I agree with you fundamentally that his feed is probably too rich for him, but I'd suggest you tell your friend to call her vet. There's always a chance that it's not just all the extra protein that's causing the problem. He may well have a feed allergy or some other issue that you're assuming is the result of his current feed ration.|`|BKXMl8E8aa	Hi, ok when a horse starts getting a runny stool it means he/she's getting to much of certain vitamin's and or mineral's. When you feed alfalfa hay thats really all you need to feed the horse cus it's got so much vitamin's and mineral's and everything else in it to keep the horse in good health. So really you just need to cut back on the adative's like the juniorglo. You know another thing you can do to keep his weight good is just feed'm the alfalfa and oats that's what a lota show horse's and race horse's get. Or with some of my horse's feed'm regular hay and grass with corn, oats, liquid747, 12:12, and wheat germ oil.|`|4AfRTzRmaa	your best bet is barley. <br>  <br>  Barley has the same protien content as grass hay (pretty low). but it sould keep the consistent weight. ONLY feed in rolled/crushed form-it is easier to digest. feed it with caution because too much can cause foundering (it also has high energy lever-highter than oats.) <br>   <br>  If you want to use oats that is the second choice. They are the greatest neuritional bost or a horse-fiber. They dont spoil easily and they dont have to be processed. :)|`|R5nXDuHmaa	you cant have a horse on grain alone, especially a young one. if you have one, call your local purina representative and have them come out. they do a free evaluation and tell you what your horse should be eating and how much. if you cant do that, purina has a free feeding calculator on their website that will give you a general idea of how much your horse should be eating of hay, but it only tells you the amount of their grains (which are great, i recommend you and your friend switch to purina)
xyF4PHzAaa	I think the main problem is getting your rabbits use to being held/handled - it's important to work on this.  Your bunnies need to get use to you handling them for multiple reasons (grooming, health check, medical treatment, etc).  So please try to work on that.  Check out websites on handling your bunnies.<br>  <br>  Please don't sedate them.  Since bunnies are "exotic" animals they handle sedation a lot differently than a cat or dog - only a vet should sedate a bunny - and only when absolutely necessary.<br>  <br>  You can try throwing a towel/blanket over your bunnies (covering them completely) so that you're able to pick them up but don't flip them on their back (another person can hold them while you trim their nails).  If you have a car you can take them there to trim their nails (turn the car on - the noise and vibration will distract the bunnies).  Again, don't flip them until they're use to being handled.   If this doesn't work you'll need to see a vet, otherwise you'll need a team of people around to help hold the bunnies still while you cut their nails, which is not recommended (too traumatic for the bunnies).<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|DWpCS65Naa	Hi, Please don't sedate your rabbits.  You may kill them if you do that.<br>  <br>  There is a website called houserabbit.org where you can find a rabbit savvy vet in your area who can teach you how to trim your rabbits nails.  <br>  There is also a yahoo group called Etherbun and they help people who have questions in regards to rabbit health.  <br>  When you go on the website for houserabbit.org...there is a plethra of information that can assist you.  <br>  I trim my rabbits nails every 2 months.  I sit them on my lap and hold out their paws.  When you go to cut the nail you have to be very careful not to cut the quick which is a blood vessel in the nail. Also, you can't just cut the nail you have to apply slight pressure with the nail cutter on the nail before you cut just to be sure you are not getting to close to the quick.  <br>  It's very hard to explain this way but please do you bunnies a favor and check out houserabbit.org  You will be glad you did.  <br>  I hope this helped.|`|4gcTZNZBaa	Rabbits hate getting nails trimmed so its hard. Ask a neighbor if you can use a room in their house. The rabbits won't squirm as much if they are in an unfamiliar environment.<br>  <br>  <br>  And no sedation!!!|`|UNCwyknbaa	i have a rabbit and we never take her to get her nails clipped becouse she runs round in the garden and we have patio which carvs them down.<br>  Good luck :)

wADItPRyaa	The papers you're talking about are called "Liability Waivers". They're useful, but they won't protect you against litigation as a result of negligence. Meaning that if you do (or don't do) something that either directly or indirectly causes someone to get hurt (even by accident) they still have the right to sue you for personal damages in civil court no matter what they signed. <br>  <br>  Also, each state has different equine and liability laws. For instance, in some states, even if the person signs a waiver, if you don't have a sign with the state's equine liability law posted on your property in a conspicuous location, you are not protected from a lawsuit. And if the language in the waiver doesn't follow your state's law, it's invalid. General liability waivers for equestrian activities are important, but if it's not in keeping with the requirements set by your state, they won't do much good.|`|nGIahXYJaa	<a href="http://www.bvsa.org/hoa/assn12639/documents/equestrian%20release%20of%20liability%20form%20(insurance%20release%20with%20helmet%20waiver).doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.bvsa.org/hoa/assn12639/docume...</a><br>  <br>  that should work ;)

NbvTyN7saa	Well if you've tried a variety of foods and nothing has changed, logically you can deduce it isn't a food based issue.  Cats can be prone to tooth decay like we are and they might have a tooth decay or infection problem.  <br>  <br>  If the smell is as bad as you can it can also be indicative of a sinus infection, mouth tumour or something not working well in their digestive tract.  Worth having a vet take a peek to find the actual source.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Bad breath is a sign of disease - an infected tooth, gum disease, kidney disease, even cancer.  Why would you want to cover the smell when your cat could be seriously ill?  Get him to the vet.  Hard to believe you have a registered Persian and yet are questioning whether to have a vet check him out or not.<br>  <br>  What foods do you feed him?  Cheap foods made with fish can also give cats bad breath.  And FYI "dental" foods are BS.  Cats mostly swallow their food whole making little contact with their teeth <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=doesdryfoodcleantheteeth" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a>|`|AcY9JgJsaa	My sisters cat had the exact same problem, it happened to be a dental problem.  They cleaned her teeth really well and said if it didn't help then they would have to pull teeth out until they see which was the bad one! Poor cat but you should take him to the vet so they could see if its the same thing, they also give them medicine to take.  Hope your cat feels better! =^o.o^=|`|kqSTDuA6aa	Sounds like it could possibly have gingivitis or other tooth or gum decay.  Sometimes we forget that kitty's have teeth too, and they need to be taken care of. If it persists, just take it to your vet. They might have to knock him out to clean it's teeth. If there is decay, it may have progressed to the point of a necessary extraction (which is fine).  If it just ate something unsavory, the smell should go away in a day or so.  Any longer than that, I would make an appointment with the doctor, cuz, hey. . . what if it were your teeth:) Good luck!!|`|lTsDwY9Paa	It sounds like he needs a professional dental cleaning from the vet. He may even need to have some teeth removed. I'd definitely take him to the vet and have his teeth looked at.|`|w2JnfhNiaa	thats how my cat used to be. but my vet said to try to brush its teeth. but if that doesnt work go to your vet. they  can help.

My own little dog is a mix between a Jack Russel Terrier and a Picanese. He is very intelligent and very quiet, but dislikes strangers. From what I have heard, Jack Russels are aggressive, and Picanese have that high shrilly bark. Bloodhounds are quite docile, but because of their ears they get ear diseases and they commonly have hereditary eye problems. Daschunds are very good dogs from what I have heard, as are Scotties.|`|7DWTnXd3aa	I agree with the terrier answer. I am the proud owner of a 6 month old  Jack Russell Terrier, and he is amazing. Jack Russell's are very easy to train, very obedient, fast learners, and good with children as well as other dogs. They do require a high energy level, so if you consider a Jack Russell do alot of research! A very loving dog, great for an apartment or small home. =) Good luck finding a puppy!|`|BJaQv8SGaa	contrary to the "Chihuahuas are psycho" comments, i happen to have an extremely sweet and loving Chihuahua. he loves EVERYONE he meets, even the strangers in the pet store and little kids. he is great, i take him everywhere with me and no one minds, because hes not a barker. i have heard some horror stories, but it really depends on how you raise them.|`|1XmrxDLFaa	Get a minature schnouzer.

0e887501126bed50bff9795d128b616faa	Do not, under any circumstances, flick his beak!!! Not only could you harm him (birds' beaks are connected to a series of sinuses and are also full of nerve endings), but physical punishment doesn't work on birds at all. Dogs, cats, and even humans may learn a "lesson"' this way, but parrots will either strike back with more force, and/or lose trust and become very frightened of you.<br>  <br>  My sun will act the same way at times. He becomes over-excited and will nip harder than he should. The best way to avoid the nipping is to not play 'the game'. That, or stop the game before the nipping becomes too intense. A good way to end the game is to distract him with a toy, or place him on a playstand, or give him a treat. If he still tries to nip, a short time out in his cage will have more of an effect than 'flicking' him. If you are consistant, it won't take him long to figure out that when he gets nippy, he doesn't get to play anymore.|`|wqybX8hqaa	Hi, we used to have a Green-cheek Conure that bit us a lot for a while. It was much like you just described; ruffling neck feathers etc. Someone told us to use a spray bottle of water every time he bites. This must be done within a couple of seconds after he bites or he won't understand why you are doing it. This won't hurt him; it will just be like scolding him (after all birds are used to being in the rain.).  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps:)|`|MU453gLqaa	You are not going to like my answer. every time he bites you flick his beak. Of course do not flick it hard enough to really hurt him just hard enough so he thinks hey maybe I should not bite her.  This will discourage him.
wLgGD63raa	First of all you are going to need a bigger tank. You wont even be able to fit ONE frog in there, it is waaaay too small for that frog. A minimum of 25 gallons for an adult pair of White's Tree Frogs is best. That tank you have shown is listed as a 1.7 gallon.<br>  <br>  An arboreal enclosure is the best choice, as White's tree frogs will spend most of their time being high in the enclosure. Plants and hollow logs/branches provide shelter and security.<br>  <br>  White's tree frogs don't require any special lighting but if you are going to put live plants in there you will need a full spectrum UVB light. Temperatures should get up to 86 degrees, this can be done with a heating pad.<br>  <br>  Potting soil, peat moss or a few sheets of damp paper towels on the bottom can be used as substrate. Avoid using small bark and gravel due to danger of ingestion.<br>  <br>  A moderate amount of humidity is required. This can be achieved through misting of the tree frogs and enclosure two or more times a day. Additionally a large water dish with a depth of about four inches is required.<br>  <br>  White's tree frogs are insectivores. They will eat crickets, cockroaches, locusts, moths and beetles. You will need to dust crickets (or any other food) with calcium & vitamins 3 times a week. Feed the tree frogs daily.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you don't know too much about these animals. You really should read up on them as much as you can before you buy one to make sure you have enough money to buy everything you need to properly care for it. Here are a few care sheets to look at.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://whitestreefrog.net/care-sheet/" rel="nofollow">http://whitestreefrog.net/care-sheet/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/frogsandtoads/a/whitestreefrog.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/frogsandt...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.herpcenter.com/whites-tree-frog-caresheet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.herpcenter.com/whites-tree-fr...</a>
uBFhKXgHaa	One of two things.<br>  <br>  1. Cheaper, low end foods might be called kitty crack because they are crappy and low in nutrition but sprayed with fats and flavorings to get cats to like them.<br>  <br>  Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.<br>  <br>  Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Dry cat food is often referred to as kitty crack. Some cats may like it, but it isn't good for them. Contrary to popular belief, wet/canned food is healthiest.<br>  <br>  The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/</a>  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=whycatsneedcannedfood" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a> (Why Cats Need Canned Food)<br>  <a href="http://www.blakkatz.com/dryfood.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.blakkatz.com/dryfood.html</a> (The Truth About Dry Cat Food)<br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canned_food.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne...</a> (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)<br>  <a href="http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bpo_ch4.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...</a> (The Dry Food Crisis)<br>  <a href="http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.htm" rel="nofollow">http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...</a> (Max's House: Feline Nutrition)<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=doesdryfoodcleantheteeth" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a> (Does Dry Food Clean the Teeth?)<br>  <br>  Another option to get cats to drink more would be a cat fountain. Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.<br>  <br>  <br>  Darksong~|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Some cheaper foods are more "addicting" where the cat will only want to eat that kind/flavor and not want other kinds.  Its not healthy to eat the same foods over and over - they should have variety of chicken, beef, lamb, venison and very little fish.<br>  <br>  Tuna is addicting and some cats get "hooked" on it and refuse to eat anything else.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	I am the one that you have seen  using that phrase. What I mean is dry food.<br>   I call it kitty crack because they put an animal fat coating on it which can make it addictive as well as having a high carbohydrate load which isn't good for carnivores. Dry food is good for people not for cats|`|ikBEORfqaa	crap nutritional value but made to be addictive like the drug crack
iFWUhpiOaa	Play with it a lot! Make sure it's brushed often. Even short haired dogs shed and brushing a pet relaxes it and shows attention which they perceive as love. You might try to be the one that always feeds it. Once you get your friend to love you, and it's not a new pet or has grown up, don't forget your friend will still need to be shown love and attention. My son has had a dalmation for 16 years. She's in bad health now but still loves her boy dearly. Nowadays she can only sit and watch him ride his skate board when before she always chased him up and down the street. She still wines when he leaves to go to school. All of the things I suggested you do, he did with and for her and he's had a life long friend he'll never forget.|`|GiGwzUeRaa	Haha that's pretty funny. But I have three dogs in my house, two family dogs and I have my own dog, and it's obvious my dog likes me best although there are 4 other people in the house. She follows me everywhere, and always comes when I call.<br>  <br>  I think the best way to get your dog to like you is to spend a lot of time with it. <br>  <br>  But I do also think that it shouldn't matter who the dog likes best, because most likely it will love all of the people in your family if you treat it well.|`|IogTqgElaa	Feed it.

The dog should like everyone in the family because they are his "pack" and that is normal. Now if U want the dog to like U just a little bit more -- then that is very simple -- U simply be the one person of the family that takes it on long walks and trains it. THAT SIMPLE. It does not matter who feeds or grooms the dog. The  dog will become the most attached to the very person who spends the most time on the clock with it. Read some dog training books. Knowledge is power.|`|b4NcFBhraa	W-O-W you sound like a 10 yr old :D lol<br>  Okay, feed it, walk it, get it toys, play with it, be the boss of it, then it'll like you best, trust me :D i do it for my dogs and they both like me A LOT either way they'll always love you :D|`|NbvTyN7saa	Why do you need an animal to like you best?

uBFhKXgHaa	Ol' Roy is commonly considered one of the worst dog foods in existence.

I'd look into those and see if they are within your budget.<br>  <br>  Darksong~|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Ol' Roy is the worst of the worst in terms of quality.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Well, Ol Roy is definitely not good.  Neither is Purina or Pedigree actually.  If you can't afford to feed your dog good enough food to keep his insides healthy, his coat looking good, his eyes & joints feeling good, then perhaps you don't need a dog.<br>  <br>  Tell your parents they need to step up a notch, not down.  You'll likely end up with a lot more diarrhea, a lot more poop and having to feed more because the ingredients suck.  It's cheaper to get a more expensive brand that is better and will last longer. :)<br>  <br>  Try Royal Canin or Nutro|`|UE4WbmtQaa	"Ol Roy" is a really bad brand of dog food. never give it to your dog. while your family may be going through some hard times you still should take the effort to get good dog food that isn't expensive. THERE ARE SOME OUT THERE!!! go to <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a>  this will give you reviews on different dog foods|`|kRO55DHyaa	If your parents insist on buying dog food at Wal-Mart, and want Ol' Roy, ask them to consider Maxximum...it's probably the best food that Wal-Mart offers.  Ol'Roy really sucks.|`|3p3otDlXaa	Chances are 1 in 50 it would make your dog throw up or feel under the weather.  Purina's better.  Pedigree is the worst.|`|QRWnKoZAaa	None of those brands are very good. When looking for a food, the main ingredient should be meat. Cheaper kibbles are made with grains, which fill a dog up, but are not part of their natural diet, so they eat more and are hungrier faster, since they can't digest it very well. When you feed a premium kibble like Evo, Blue Buffalo or Orijen, you actually need to feed less because more of the dog's nutritional needs are being met. <br>  <br>  Could you get a part time job to help pay for your dog's food? The economy is bad, but it's less expensive in the long run to keep your dog healthy instead of incurring high vet bills for problems that can come up down the road.|`|iembGsl9aa	Ol Roy is likely the crappiest food brand along with Kibbles n Bits, Pedigree and Purina are better (but not great) and TBH Purina is NOT that expensive.<br>  <br>  R u cutting down on ur food quality for urself too?|`|Do2pJx8Aaa	Those are marginally better than ol Roy
0ZrRRGmiaa	I agree with DENICE, the best solution is obediance and it is not as pricey as everyone thinks. We have our dog in obediance and it only cost $125 for 8 weeks, every monday for an hour and a half. Best money we ever spent if you ask me.|`|FxLKs5Vbaa	When you find out please tell me. I am having the same issue with my Spikey.|`|HIwJFtNlaa	What you can do is carry treats with you while you walk and whenever another dog comes around you catch her attention with a treat and make her look at you and then give her a treat to keep her attention. But you have to remember, she's a dog, she still loves you; she just gets distracted easily, relax!<br>  I have a white west highland terrier, and he has a terrible attention span, and runs away to play with other dogs too, but I know he loves me because he cries when he wants me to open the door for him so he can accompany me, or we watch tv together. Spend more time with your dog, and make sure she knows that you're the caretaker and that you're giving her love and you deserve love back.<br>  good luck!|`|5dqJSTjTaa	take him to obediance school and they will train him and every time he doesnt jolt towards dogs give him a treat or pat him on the head
2CbfO4jWaa	tegus are in the family teiidae, monitors in the family varanidae. the differences are thousands of years of evolution and and oceans between them. tegus and monitors are examples of convergent evolution  meaning 2 totally different animals (in this case families of animal) evolve very similar looks and behaviors due to the similarity of their environments and the niches they in-habit. to put it simply, tegus are the new world version of the monitors.

k7vK0Pccaa	You can either by a larger tank, or get rid of some fish.  Many pet stores will buy fish back from you.|`|CqquoBy4aa	You should get a new tank.|`|a7IHVTNZaa	Its amazing that your tank is doing this well since you added ALL of the fish after only 4 days! Normally you would add some "junk" fish to get the nitrogen cycle started. Only after it has stabilized should you add the bulk of the population.<br>  <br>  How attached are you to these fish? You need to get rid of several of them to make it comfortable for the rest. You need to decide which ones should leave.<br>  <br>  If you can't decide which will go, throw a large oscar  in and it will take care of your overcrowding problem. This isn't a highly recommended method since you will have to rid of a large oscar afterwards. Plus some people don't like the idea of their fish being eaten just to thin them out.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Get rid of fish. Or buy a larger tank and use both of them. Those are your only options.<br>  <br>  Nigerian cycle. You are my hero.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Rehome fish, or buy more aquariums. <br>  As for the people at the pet store they should not have allowed you to buy so many fish at once for such a small, uncycled tank.<br>  <br>  Concerning weekly water changes- I do weekly water changes for my tanks which are stocked well. With an overstocked tank you should be doing multiple weekly water changes of about 25%<br>  <br>  The NITROGEN cycle may take as much as six weeks.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Give your fish away to a friend or get a bigger tank, that's it.|`|TjLCnxkKaa	The Nigerian cycle never ends, just don't give them your bank details.|`|B7ciNw0aaa	You need to get rid of some fish.

6SstJ0sdaa	Yes, she's probably cold. She'll probably start going outside again when her fur grows back and/or when it gets warmer outside. You may just have to open the door and set her out on a schedule if possible. Or get her a doggie sweater. Probably the shoes aren't necessary.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|GSf09ALBaa	Giselle, most people on this site don't agree with putting clothes on a dog.  But in your case, get her a sweater.  You had her groomed down to the skin in the coldest of winter and she is freezing.  That is probably one of the biggest reasons she is not using her doggie door.  I have a foster Dachshund that refuses to go outside when it is 50 degrees here in Florida!  <br>  <br>  Put a sweater on her and while her coat grows out, keep the mats combed out so you don't have do to this again.  One of the most important parts of being a good dog owner is keeping your dog comfortable in it's own skin.  In otherwords, keep your dog clean and mat free.|`|dEk2KNksaa	My dogs hate going out when it is cold or snowy out. When it is brutally cold, I will put a sweater on the little dogs (although I think it is ridiculous as well). If you get one, I have found that they tolerate the ones that don't have "arm holes" but instead have a strap that goes across the chest to keep it on.<br>  I would suggest that you don't give her much freedom when she is in the house. Make sure she is always in the same room and very close to you. And just take her out and set her in the grass until she goes. It stinks standing out in the cold but I guess if we want them to do it sometimes we have to as well. We also keep our dogs crated when we're gone until they are 100% housebroken. We have a dog door too but they only use it when it is nice out. Other than that, we have to tell them to go out.

znGpjsGjaa	Since no one gave you an actual answer that is going to help you hopefully I can help some.<br>  <br>  The best way to make sure she is feeding them since she has fed them that you know of is to "force" the doe to feed the kits. This will not hurt the doe or the kits but will get her to feed them so you know they are getting enough.<br>  <br>  First you need to get a better box to put the kits and their nest in. A clean unused cat litter box will do. Place the whole nest (not the cardboard box) in the litter box. Remove the kits from the does cage. Place them in a safe place away from any other animals or people.<br>  Leave them seperated from the doe for at least 2 hours.<br>  Take the box to where the doe is place the box on a sturdy table or the floor. Have a towel that will cover the box completely with the doe in it. Place the doe in the box directly over the kits. Cover her with the towel and leave her in the box for 15 minutes. Stay close by so she doesn't try and jump out. If she does just place a hand on her back and lightly hold her in the box. After 15 minutes check the kits. If they look fed (their bellies are round) then return her to her cage and repeat the process again in 8 hours. If she has not fed them return her to the kits and leave her for another 15 minutes. If after this time she has not fed them return her to her cage and try again in another 2 hours.<br>  Do this everyday, 2 and perhaps 3 times a day until the kits look like they are growing and getting plenty to eat. This usually takes about a week to 10 days. After that time just return the nesting box to her cage and she will take care of them.<br>  <br>  Do not worry that it is because you touched them. that is a myth that way too many people like to keep telling. I have raised rabbits for over 16 years and have hundreds of litters. I handle the kits from day one and the does have never hurt or ababdoned them because of it.<br>  Some does just need to be "reminded" of what their job is.<br>  A doe will only eat the kits as they are being born and have a "blood smell" to them. After a couple hours they will not cannibalize them.<br>  <br>  Remember to clean the nesting by day 10 so the kits will not get nestbox eye from dirty litter. Try and save some of the fur the doe pulled to cover them back up. They should start opening their eyes at day 10-12.<br>  <br>  By 3 weeks they will start exploring and will leave the nesting box for periods of time. Make sure they can get to pellets and water. No fresh foods until they reach 6 months.<br>  <br>  Do not feed peanut butter to a rabbit, it will make them very sick. To help her produce milk feed her fresh parsley leaves and dry uncooked old-fashioned oatmeal.<br>  <br>  If you need more help or have questions you can email me privately from my profile.|`|sP3UtfJ1aa	by touching the babies she might not want to take care of them at all but u also have to be careful wen my rabbit had bunnies she ate them! it was mortifying !  they r known to do that apparently|`|P9byozx9aa	First of all how do you know shes not feeding them, maybe they're getting fed, you just don;t know she's feeding them, mother rabbits feed their babies around the time they were born. Feed her something like squash, or maybe a little peanut butter to help her produce more milk.|`|AA11230150	What exactly is your master plan for these rabbit babies?  Huh?|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Rabbits do not feed their babies as much as you think they do, and you shouldn't have held her down to do so. If she didn't have enough milk they wouldn't have had fat bellies to begin with!<br>  <br>  You also shouldn't have touched the babies. <br>  <br>  You should be feeding her more, that will help and we give our does calf manna for extra milk.<br>  <br>  <br>  I did give you the correct answer, you shouldn't be touching the babies and the mom obviously knows what she is doing if the babies are fat. We have NEVER made a doe feed her babies, NEVER and I have raised rabbits all my life as well as my family before I was even born.<br>  <br>  And I raise rabbits as well and no it is not a myth. They don't like their nests to be messed with or anyone handling their babies. If you absolutely have to (and I have had to, to get dead babies out of the nest boxes) you can put vaseline on the moms nose so she can't smell and pet her so your hands smell like her then do what you need to do. But it is wrong to have to hold them one by one on a nipple.
cNYugr5raa	Most places tend to allow dogs more than cats,if you are renting that is. Also, for some reason most people tend to be more attached to dogs than cats when they are pets. i personally love cats above anything else.|`|HzL6FSVgaa	cats are useless.  At least dogs will keep you company, cats will only come around for food.|`|CqquoBy4aa	It seems like dogs are more expensive and people like them more.|`|lif8jpq0aa	people like dogs more!|`|61067fedf264463ca62586a8d1d24170aa	Dogs are more personable and friendly.

AA11901352	First off only one fish for now.  You will need to get a filtered tank and forget the carnival fish unless you are talking about fancy's (most fairs give fancy's away not commons or comets these days)  A medium size fancy is around 4 inches a medium size comet is 6 and a medium size common is around 18  that doesn't say much here.<br>  <br>  Honestly I know you think your fish is small but he will grow quickly and soon out grow the 1 gallon bowl.  Really, no more fish and you should consider getting alarger either bowl or tank 10 minimum.  Really.<br>  <br>  No more fish here.|`|6jrv0MWTaa	One is too many: by placing more goldfish in a small tank you would be damaging their health, and shortening their lifespan.

Goldfish grow to 16 inches. There is no reason for one to be in any less than 20 gallons. Stop being cruel.<br>  <br>  The carnival goldfish are usually comet goldfish. Those were the ones that grow to 16 inches. You are still cruel.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Absolutely none. Not ever should a goldfish be housed in something that tiny. Twenty gallon minimum for a juvenile goldfish, 55 gallons at least for a single adult comet.<br>  <br>  A medium sized goldfish is about six inches. They should grow at least one foot long, but have been known to grow larger.<br>  <br>  I assure you that the fish does not have plenty of room. When housing goldfish you need to take into account their adult size, and waste output. At least a foot long, and a massive waste producer...now look at that one gallon tank. It is too small. Adding more fish is out of the question.<br>  <br>  ~Please be aware that goldfish do not grow to fit the size of their environment. The goldfish will stunt in a tank that size which means the body stops growing but the organs continue. It will shorten his lifespan.
CqquoBy4aa	You might have to change your water more often.|`|d4ed95bed4c328fffaf810f911eaa905aa	how large is the tank, what temp you keep it it?<br>  <br>  if you are wanting a quality betta, it is worth paying extra, and ordering one online and having it shipped to your house.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  there is part of your problem. <br>  <br>  you have a tiny tank.

Because of genetics, some fish are hardier than others of the same species, and even from the same egg clutch. <br>  <br>  that means, after all the stress from the store, you get them home, and give them itty bitty living space, and cold water, and you have an increased chance that the weaker fish wil not survive that.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  please, give a larger heated tank a shot....|`|5534c8c49d7bb6d1ff3d50a5664ff8b7aa	I was always told to use distilled water only with my betta's.

UKpNiRf6aa	Housetraining is one the most important training efforts you'll ever make, but it does not have to be difficult.<br>  <br>  First is to establish a routine. The first thing every morning and the last thing every night, take your puppy outside. Feed him at the same time every day and take him outside as soon after a meal as possible, usually within fifteen minutes. During housetraining when you're with your puppy, take him out every hour. While fresh drinking water should be available at all times, you may want to time a very young puppy's drinks to just prior to his scheduled hourly potty breaks.<br>  <br>  Second, until he is trained keep a constant eye on your puppy. During housetraining, the only time your puppy should have the run of the house is when you are there to watch him.<br>  <br>  Third, is to crate-train your puppy. Puppies instinctively want to keep their sleeping space clean. Make the crate a happy place for your puppy. Encourage him to go into the crate by tossing a toy or kibble of food inside while commanding "crate". Once inside, praise him and close the door. After a moment, let your puppy back out of the crate. Repeat the exercise, gradually extending his time inside.<br>  <br>  Use the crate as a bed and as a safe place for your puppy whenever you are gone or cannot watch him. Try not to make a big deal out of opening the door to let him out, you want your puppy to know that praise follows the command to go inside the crate. When taking your puppy out of his crate during the first few weeks of the housetraining period, put a leash on him and walk to his designated potty place as quickly as possible. This will lessen the chance of an accident.<br>  <br>  As a general rule, your puppy can safely be left in his crate the number of hours that equal his age in months plus one.<br>  <br>  Fourth is designate a potty area. Let your puppy know where he should go potty by taking him to a designated potty place. Do this by consistently taking him to the same spot and commanding "Go potty". When he does have an accident, wipe it up and put the rag of paper towel at the designated potty place. The scent will help clue him in to your command. When he does potty in the proper place, reward your puppy with lavish praise and lots of petting. Only after he has eliminated should your puppy be allowed to play outside. He has to learn that it's business first.<br>  <br>  Fifth is to correct your puppy's mistakes only when you catch him in the act. With a firm "NO!" pick up your puppy and take him to the designated potty area. A puppy is a baby and you must expect some accidents. It's not his fault. Be patient. Clean up the area with an odor neutralizer to prevent further soiling in that place.<br>  <br>  Should your puppy continue to have problems with urinating, we would recommend that you continue to work with your veterinarian.|`|BJaQv8SGaa	they are indeed notorious for this. my Chi will NOT pee on us or the couch, so i hold him after he eats/drinks until we take him outside to pee AND poo. try putting him in an area he will not go to the bathroom until you take him outside and show him where he should go. it's difficult sometimes, they're persistent little guys! =) good luck!|`|8TLCxEJzaa	well my chihuahua is hopelessly impossibly can not be potty trained. so i let her out when ever she barks and after she is feeded. my chihuahua is also 2 years old.|`|bIaywrBCaa	have you just recently got her? Dogs do often look at carpet as giant pee pads. That is why we no longer have carpet in our house. Can you keep her in a bathroom or laundry room while you are gone? Or better start crate training her as if she is a puppy. Also we have a doggy door and even our young pups learn early to start going outside to potty. Some chihuahuas can be easily trained to use a litter box as well.|`|Ot06v8yvaa	the person on top is right
lLC7Cf2zaa	Like the others said, and take him to the vet today asap.  I understand, you think he's a tough dog, that he'll get it out on his own - but he's not so tough and needs your help right now by taking him to the vet.  Personally, being curious, I'd try to get a good look at it with a flashlight and tweezers.  If it looks like one solid piece, not splintered or in a strange shape, just pull a little to see if it comes out.  Keep encouraging the dog and tell him not to bite you.  Then if it's really still in there, go to the vet immediately.  You might need to get some antibiotics, it depends.  They love to "enlarge" the opening and do a little surgery.  They won't do it infront of you, so you don't need to be worried about it.  And he'll have local anesthesia to numb it like at the dentists', ok?|`|5rfnEQnGaa	If you cannot simply pull it out you may need to take the dog to the vet.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Not to be rude, but you shouldn't have been letting him chew on a stick.  Also, why wait all day before doing anything?<br>  <br>  If you can't reach in and get a grip to pull it out yourself then you need to call the vet.  If it gets infected he could end up with a lot more serious problems than a mouth splinter. If he swallows it, and it gets stuck in his stomach/intestines/throat/bowels/etc you have a whole lot more problems.|`|v0RsFaAzaa	If you don't want to cause permanent damage to your dogs mouth by trying to remove it yourself, you need to take him to the vet and have the vet remove it the right way! That's got to be not only very painful for him, but very aggravating to him. He won't be able to eat or possibly drink. He will probably get an Infection.You need to take the poor thing to an Emergency Vet Tonight! He's already suffered with it stuck in his mouth all day and I think it's cruel not to take care of it immediately! Get off the computer, grab your dog and go! We cannot help your dog over the Internet! Why didn't you take him to the vet when you saw the stick was stuck and made him suffer with it all day, is something I don't understand.|`|Dkb2ZR3Daa	YOU don't.. you take him to the vet where they will for you. Why... you need to make sure that it is in fact only one splinter, it probably is very painful, and may need some sedation. Lastly, he will definitely need antibiotics!
G0KKfXMUaa	Well, first things first, give him a break. You both need to cut down on the stress and frustration. If you both keep having bad days, it will only get worse.<br>  <br>  And when I mean break, I don't just mean a day. I mean about a week. I understand he needs to lose weight, but one week won't hurt, especially if it will help make him easier to ride.<br>  <br>  But, as you already did, just keep trying to change things up in the ring. Instead of just cantering around the ring, do a lot of circles, lead changes, cutting half the ring, through the center, etc. And trot a lot of poles. But not just a normal line. Lay them in all sorts of spots in the ring. Make it a good challenge for him to figure out. The more you make him use his brain, the better.<br>  <br>  And if you jump, set up some awkward jumps and lines to keep him excited.<br>  <br>  Now, you said you have no trails? Well it doesn't have to be labled trail for you to go on it. What's around your barn? I would assume dirt or cement roads? Are they busy? If not, you could take him in a "trail" and just follow the road, as long as it's not too congested.<br>  <br>  But other than riding, make sure to keep him entertained on the ground. Make sure he also gets let out with a friend. Also work on building your relationship with him... this calls for a lot of grooming, leading, washing, etc.<br>  <br>  Another thing, riding with multiple horses' in the ring might perk him up since he likes a lot of things going on around him. Ask a few friends to ride with you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Edit- to everyone who said change the feed, she already said she doesn't have control over that.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit again-<br>  <br>  Until he stops acting up? This depends. Some horse's will stop right away when the schedule is changed. Though some horses will take a week or two to be "englightened" so to speak. Just don't give up. And if there is not good footing in the field, do not ride him in it. Everyone who is saying ride in the field does not know what your field is like.

Align yourself straight with the small jump and give him a lot of leg so that he won't refuse. And there ya go! He should go over it. If he goes around it, then just give him more leg. the more practice, the better he'll get.|`|ff42beaeb7a8ee5d3b32dd2655c08c36aa	if you are the trainer why do you have no controil over what they are feeding this horse?<br>  he sounds completely burnt out.<br>  he needs to go on the trial.<br>  i would be bored to death myslef if i was land locked on 4 acres with no access to anything else.|`|BI1GbIZUaa	For a horse that has been out of work riding him every day isn't fair. He should always get a day off. Even though my horse is used to lots of work i always give him a day off. Try riding around the barn at a walk for your warm-up and cool down. He needs other stuff to stimulate him. Only ride him and work him really hard a couple days a week and ride him lightly the other days. Sounds to me like he was thrust into too much work too fast for him. I know you want him to lose weight but try giving him a couple days off and see if that helps. He may just need to rest his brain every could of weeks.Sounds like you're going to have to work him into accepting a vigorous work schedule. Don't be discouraged, he'll get used to it and then you can ride to your hearts content.  I would also try to seriously talk to the owner about what he's fed. If they care about his health they will want him to lose weight and will agree to a change in his diet. You could also see if they would be ok with him being turned out in a grazing muzzle a couple days a week.|`|ecf159d9c2d48432e189d0cac81882e2aa	My friend has a ring sour horse and it is NOT fun. <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is give your horse a break. <br>  If he is getting grain - stop giving it to him.<br>  <br>  A week without being ridden should give him the mental break he needs. <br>  <br>  Yes he'll gain a little weight back, but that doesn't mean you can't get it back off. I'd say riding him every other day, or at least giving him one day off a week is the best thing. He'll still loose the weight if he's on a proper diet and doing the right exercises. But horses get stressed and mentally overworked just like people. I ride my extremely easy keeper 3 times a week and he is in best shape at our barn.|`|geeSX6HHaa	Try doing ground work while inside the arena and doing your riding outside the arena.  He'll learn that the arena isn't just a place for work but a place to just kick back an run around as well.  You could try turning him out in the arena as well.  But I would definitely suggest lunging and riding in places other than the arena.|`|Y12dZVLjaa	jus keep ridin him and lunging and stuff like that u will have to be patient it will take time for ur horse to lose wait!xx|`|d6gE2XQ0aa	My horse had a ring sour problem for a long time and he wasn't getting any where. I figured to put myself in his place and look at it that way. Try longing in a new place, or maybe even just walk a whole lot in the arena. It might be better if you and him have somebody else to ride with. Only for your sake and his as well. Try riding new ways, switch directions often and don't make him go one way for to long, because they get bored and that might change their attitude. I only recommend the longest break to be about three days. If the break is to long he might be sore or not as well ridden. I hope you follow this advice it worked for my horse.|`|LAXxaxAZaa	Mix things up.<br>  <br>  Work him in the pasture he gets turned out in. Turn him out in the arena. Ride him around the barn. Walk him into the arena, give him a treat, and put him back in his stall. Feed him in the arena.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT -- Also, remember that you can work him twice as hard three days a week and get about the same results. It'll be tough for him at first, but as he gets more conditioned it'll get easier and easier.|`|ejj2N3uaaa	Are there any other places you can ride other than the arena? Even if there are no trails, riding in the pasture (when it's empty) or any available open space would help. Play games and learn something new. If the main goal is getting him in shape, it won't really matter if it's not his "normal" discipline. Do some trot poles. Try some dressage moves. Set up a trail course. Make it fun. <br>  <br>  If he still won't perk up, you might want to give him a few days off. I know it seems like that would defeat getting him in shape, but a slightly fat horse is better than a horse with a bad attitude. A few days off might change his attitude enough so that he's ready to work the next time.<br>  <br>  Is there no way to limit his grass or feed intake--a muzzle during turnout, less feed, etc.? What about increasing his turnout (using a dirt/sand area, if possible so he can't graze and eat more)? Take him on walks (hand walk if necessary) anywhere you can. Take advantage of any available opportunity to do something new or get him off the property.
cqLYkuz8aa	It really depends on where you are and what you are doing. Most veterinary associates make between 65,000 and 80,000. Often less for the first couple of years. If you specialize or own a clinic you can make significantly more. If you work in the city, you usually make more than if you live in the country.<br>  <br>  BTW in the US, a veterinary doctorate is a medical doctorate, not a PhD. A veterinarian has either a DVM or VMD, depending on where they go to school.<br>  <br>  Veterinary medicine has a very poor education to income ratio. No one goes into the field for the money.<br>  <br>  Different kinds of vets:<br>  Small animal: works with mostly dogs and cats, but can also specialize in a single species like cats only. Usually work in an office.<br>  <br>  Large animal: Farm animals and Horses. Can work out of an office or do farm calls or both<br>  <br>  Equine: Horses, can work at a race track, hospital, or do farm calls.<br>  <br>  Food Animal: work only with animals used for food, dairy cows, beef cows, chickens, pigs, goats. Usually farm calls.<br>  Industry/lab animal: working for a large company to oversee animals used for research. Office job<br>  <br>  Exotics/pocket pets: small animals that are not dogs or cats (things like rabbits, guinea pigs, sugar gliders, reptiles, and birds).<br>  <br>  Regulatory: work for the government evaluating food safety, public health, and animal welfare. Help investigate and control outbreaks. can be office job or field job.<br>  <br>  Wildlife/Zoo: work at zoos or for various agencies providing medical care for non-domestic animals and doing wildlife research.|`|cNYugr5raa	you can specialize in exotic animals such as big birds and anphibians, or you can be a vet that deals mainly with dogs, cats, and things closely related to that. Or you can specialize in horses and livestock, you mainly see these kind for ranches and such. Seeing as you will have to have a PHD to be a vet, you will probably make no less than 70,000  starting and can move up to about 100,000 depending upon location, years of experience and what type of animal vet you want to be.|`|9z5YJKqLaa	there are many kinds, specific ones dont come to mind,<br>  <br>  a vet technician makes about 60,000 a year|`|8QvvXYaqaa	about 80,000 a year

PM23RDycaa	Buy putting up a fence. Fences keep other animals out as well. You shouldn't be leaving you animal outside unsupervised to begin with. Anything can happen. If the dog is outside you need to be outside as well.|`|iembGsl9aa	With a fence<br>  No dog is ever 100% reliable 2 not leave the yard. Yes some dogs r very good, but there is always that chance. Especially in the front yard.<br>  DO ur dog a favour and get a fence|`|Ah9nRiidaa	Yeah you can never fully train a dog to stay in the front yard because something can go wrong. If they are to attached they are going to follow you if you walk away from the front yard. If they like to run they are going to run right out of the front yard..So I agree get a fence.
YtBzRAxMaa	This is a whole lot of horse and $$ for an inter rider.<br>  <br>   The add says he is bold - usually means he is fast over his jumps. Watch his head after each jump - he is pulling the reins wanting to speed up.

Anywhere near the level he is?<br>   Do you show? Do you know how to continue his training for him to become a jumper?<br>  <br>   I'd pass if I were you - and look for a horse that is more suitable for you to handle as an inter.

Use that as your model.<br>  <br>  I don't know where your horse is on that scale, but do lots of flexion work to get him supple and responsive (ask your trainer to show you how). Work on keeping him slow and steady. Consistency is key. Transitions should be discreet but quick (no kicking your horse into the lope or pulling him hard to get him to slow down). You need to go on as loose a rein as possible with no visible rein cues. Basically, the horse should look like he's doing it all by himself. Slow is your goal, but not dragging/on the forehand--make sure he's using his hind end as well.|`|uVBrBGh1aa	you cant "look up" skills you gain them through practice and experience.  what kind of skills are you trying to obtain,  can you control the horse?  do you just need to work on equitation?  you need to do different exercises to strengthen your riding abilities?<br>  <br>  well figure 8s help to teach your horse to bend, you to properly switch diagonals (if riding english), you and your horse to do lead changes.  you could set up obsticals to steer around or over, there lots of things you could do, you could ride bare back or just without stirrups for a bit.  it depends what kind of skills you are wishing to obtain and how you want to go about gaining the experience.     <br>  <br>  good luck|`|G0KKfXMUaa	Well... what kind of advice?

X2BMymt8aa	It's impossible for a dog to moo because it's vocal chords are not designed to be able to make a proper moo sound. Humans can only imitate animal sounds, they can't actually do them properly. I suppose you could get your dog to imitate the moo sound if you had a lot of time and patience. A cow wouldn't be able to make a dog sounds either.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Sure you can.  People teach their dogs to say "I love mama'.

2p5VsmZhaa	He's probably a mix between a Maltese and some other dog. Possibly a Cocker Spaniel/Maltese mix, if the owners said so. Or it could be a dog that's neither a Spaniel or Maltese. My best advice would be to make a chart and look through an AKC book of breads, then check what characteristics he has like some dogs you see, like this<br>  <br>  (place breed here)          (place breed here)            (place breed here)<br>  <br>  (information here)           (information here)            (information here)<br>  <br>  then try to see what dog he's most like.

KuUx34hCaa	as he goes to bite put your thumb in his mouth & press down on the tongue quite hard he might yip but it will do NO damage but it will teach him not to bite it's an old native technique & it works but be consistent & say no bite at the same time|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	Omg I have a jack-rat.  We got her as a puppy.  Same thing - devil and angel in one little furry body.  Try substituting chew sticks - rawhide chips too... give her a firm "no" and switch out the item being eaten for the item to be chewed on.  Encourage him to be nice, not to bite.  Don't let the daughter play with him at all without your direct supervision and instruct her on nice petting techniques.  Jack Russells/ Rat Terriers are not often fond of children - they'll deal with them and tolerate them, but it will take some time before they will accept them as part of their "pack" that is to be protected and adored by the JRT.  Don't hit him or mistreat him b/c their temperament is still sensitive and feelings can be hurt - they get that from the Jack Russel.. The Rat Terrier side is also very skiddish around people and unsure of the intentions of little hands.  My dog doesn't bite anymore, now at 5 years, except the occasional overexcited play fighting nip.  She used to chew our chairs, anything wood in the apartment.... horrible!  And poo and pee everywhere.|`|yLwKWzIUaa	use baby gates to section off the house. and keep dog and todler separated.<br>  both are too young to play nicely and need to learn, but it will happen. i suggest you being there though when puppy and todler are together<br>  so you can teach both of them how to play nicely :)|`|3p3otDlXaa	yell at him firmly without anger.
bIaywrBCaa	a sudden change like this at any age is cause for concern and specially with an aging dog. I hope the vet will return your call soon and he will probably need to do a full exam on her.

He was playing outside, and had tweaked his back. He was 11 at the time.  We took him to the vet after a day or two of him acting very pathetic and yelping and even occasionally nipping at us when we tried to pet him (which he NEVER did). The vet gave him some pain killers.  It made him a zombie for a while, and he laid around a lot for a few weeks, but eventually his back got better and he is back to his old puppy playfulness.  He's not 14 yrs old and still acts like he's 2.  He has an occasional accident now... I think that's his old age, but we try to be sweet to him anyway and just keep him on the tile.  Be assertive with the vet if you have to because your dog is obviously very important to you. Good luck.  I hope your dog gets better.

3p6wp7DYaa	Yeah, I think the salami is probably the cause. Imagine giving salami to a toddler who never ate anything like it and you will get the point. She's probably going to be fine after expelling all of this from her system. However, you should watch out for any signs of dehydration or any other issues. Offer her water and give her ice cubes to chew on. Call the vet if she's not better by tomorrow morning.|`|NbvTyN7saa	Anything is possible.  To help control this, get canned pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling but canned pumpkin and put a good tablespoon in their food.

I consider small to be less than the size of a quarter.  <br>  <br>  When my dog gets the runs, I give her 24-36 hours to work it out.  If it continues, or is paired with any other symptoms (like lack of appetite, lethagy, panting, vomiting, etc), then she goes to the vet at their next opening.  My vet usually has same day appointments for urgent cases.  <br>  <br>  I would NOT do any at home remedies unless recommended by your vet.  Pumpkin can cause runnier poop in some cases.  I would withold food until the stoll starts to form a little, and then I would gradually introduce boiled unseasoned chicken and white unseasoned rice.|`|CQww1c2daa	Salami could do it.  <br>  <br>  If she continues to have diarrhea, please take her to the vet.|`|HJ0Ujd4Oaa	i think u answered ur own question|`|dEk2KNksaa	If you are just talking about a small piece of salami, there is no way that this would cause 18 hours worth of diarrhea. Could your dog have gotten into anything else? Maybe something outside like a dead animal or something rotten? If you have fed the dog regular food and the diarrhea has not subsided, you may want to think about taking him or her to the vet. The dog is probably dehydrated and may need to be given some fluids either through a shot or an IV.|`|tTntRZNDaa	If diarrhea is the only symptom and it goes away within a day or two, it's likely that your dog simply ate something she shouldn't have.<br>  <br>  But if she has any other symptoms, such as vomiting, loss of appetite, or lethargy, if there's blood in the stool, or if the diarrhea is chronic, there may be a more serious problem. If you observe any of these symptoms, definitely contact your vet.<br>  <br>  To prevent food-related diarrhea, don't give your dog anything that's gone bad (contrary to popular belief, dog stomachs aren't "tougher" than ours). Keep his diet relatively steady; a lot of variety can cause gastrointestinal upset. And of course, keep the trash off-limits.|`|iFWUhpiOaa	It sounds like the beginning of Parvo and it won't take long to take your dog down. You may already know, but for a dog, having Parvo is like us having the flu, only it kills them and there's no shot to prevent it. They don't always throw up and blood may not be in the stool yet but I've had too many dogs die from it as well as saved a few. Has your dig been vaccinated for Parvo? If it were me, I'd run not walk to the nearest vet. If your pet isn't taking in liquids it may not have as much diarrhea, but still be sick. There is also something called Montezuma's revenge. Any animal or person can get it. I had a cat who had it and the cat had diarrhea real bad. I didn't think it was serious because it was still eating and drinking the first several days. It took about 5 days, but it died. By the time I realized it was serious and took it to the vet it was too late to save it.

evnj2DUpaa	The gestation period for cats is about two months. Be careful with your calico, it is a fact that multicolored cats are more prone to breast cancer, my aunt's calico cat died of it. They can get it even if they are spayed. I suggest getting her spayed right after she has her kittens. Best of luck, and be careful.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Get her spayed.  No reason she should be pregnant.<br>  <br>  And cats carry kittens for 63-68 days.|`|dy23vqlBaa	It takes 63–65 days. for a female to have a litter. you may need to keep a close eye on her the last few days of her pregnancy young mother sometime have a hard time with delivering the first time.

kNYDHZqAaa	Have you considered getting another cat? It can really help with aggression issues, because then they can bite and wrestle with each other instead of trying to do it with you. Sometimes cat attacks aren't really attacks, it's the cat trying to play with you and get some energy out. Don't bite him on the ear, though, he won't get why you're doing it. The squirt bottle is a good discipline tool when you need it, though. Also, when he gets in attack mode, try to refocus his attention on the toys.<br>  <br>  And part of the problem is probably that he was taken from his mother at three weeks. That's not normal or recommended, and it can lead to some socialization problems.|`|6OgJK9E4aa	Another option is to put about 25 cents worth of pennies into an empty glass jar and shake it loudly at the cat while saying "no".  <br>  <br>  Here are some more tips:  <a href="http://www.our-happy-cat.com/cat-discipline.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.our-happy-cat.com/cat-discipl...</a>|`|5mPUumWvaa	I have the same thing with my kitten, it takes a little bit of time.  Squirt bottles are only effective in certain situations (like when my one cat climbed the christmas tree--she never did it again!)  I'd recommened bopping her on the nose, that is how the mother cat teaches them when they are young, but since you got him so young it might not work, when i got my one cat at 4 weeks she could give a rats behind on a bop on the nose.  I am not being cruel when i say this, but if you have to bop her nose or give her a light smack on her toosh he will learn his lesson.  At this age kittens are invinsable it takes a lot to hurt them.  I NEVER would abuse my cats, but sometimes you just got to show them whos boss.  Also get him fixed! If he is an indoor-only cat it is not cruel to get his front claws removed, but if he is an outdoor/indoor cat then dont.  Hope this helps :) dont worry the kitten crazies will be over soon enough (sometimes not soon enough ;))|`|n7BIleRFaa	Give him time.  Kittens need time to grow attached to you.  I would suggest to stop using your squirt bottle and simply clap and say no loudly at the same time when he misbehaves.

I would have a necropsy(autopsy) done to find out for sure.<br>  <br>  So sorry for your loss.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Vomiting, white gums, shaking/weakness, and lethargy are all signs of shock.  There's absolutely no way of knowing what caused the shock though.  Could be anything from a poison/toxin to heart failure to a contagious virus such as parvo or distemper, internal bleeding due to injury, internal bleeding due to cancer, death of the intestine due to torsion, the possibilities are nearly endless.  If you really need to know to find closure or for the benefit of other dogs in the house hold then your best bet is to take the body to a vet and have a necropsy performed.|`|dEk2KNksaa	Did you take the dog to a vet?

Aren't you concerned?  Why are you on here asking?  Just go to the emergency vet right away.

As long as the dog is eating, drinking, acting normally, exhibiting no other signs of illness, and showing no increase in frequency of the vomiting, there is typically no reason to worry.<br>  <br>  Always consult your vet if your dog's vomiting is chronic, continues for more than a day, or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as weight loss, decreased appetite, diarrhea, or excessive water intake.|`|75h5Bzfvaa	That means he is sick. You should take him to the vet as soon as possible.|`|FDQg1ldFaa	clean it up
MmRDzhaHaa	It often takes this long, but as 2 hours has now gone by you should expect the next in about half an hour to 45 mins,it can take up to 24 hours for the whole litter to arrive,but this depends how many she expecting,be sure to check that she doesn't accidentally squash the new kitten while giving birth to the next as she will move about a lot in her birthing bed!|`|0YzP6iOTaa	My cat had her kittens about a year ago April1st. She had her first 5 kittens pretty quickly within 10 mins of each other. Her 6th came an hour after her 5th, so anywhere from about a few mins to an hour. My cats vet said it averages about 8 hours to give birth to all her kittens. If it goes too much over an hour bring her to the vet ASAP.|`|dfgFiAUNaa	ok well from personal experience cats can give birth to kittens that last between 5 min and 3 hours between them. cats can also stop their labor for up to 24 hours if they feel stressed out or annoyed. my cats has done this several times. when the male cat would not leave her alone with her last litter (born a week ago) she stopped her labor and then the next day she had her kittens She did not come on a "schedule" one kitten was born the 30 min later another then like and hour and 30 min later another then 10 min the 3rd one and bout 2 hours later the last one so it just depends on the cat|`|uR1xpNtRaa	it varies it will take anywhere between a 3 minutes to thirty minutes.
v0RsFaAzaa	It sounds to me like she is dying. When dogs are dying, they hide in a place they feel comfortable and secluded in and they die. Please try to get her out from where she is hiding, take her to the vet and if the vet cannot help her, have her Humanely Euthanized. The smell she's giving off, is also another sign of a dying dog. I'm very sorry!|`|bIaywrBCaa	she may have decided that is where she wants to die. I am sorry, she probably does not have much time left.|`|GSf09ALBaa	She is trying to find a comfortable quiet place to die.  Bundle her up and take her to the vet and put her humanely down.|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	Oh I'm not a believer in humanely putting animals down - but just about every pet my family has ever had was put down "humanely".  Death comes when it's ready.  And the animals aren't ready either when there's that evidence of love and adoration still in their eyes.  I've just never had the time to help them at the very end, and it's so hard to watch them at the end, but it must be done if you love your animal and can learn from my mistakes...   The animal may be in pain - so give it comfort and support, maybe pain killers - and even keep her cool if she seems overheated.  Give her something to help her be soothed, like her favorite stuffed toys.  Allow her food and water.  If she wants to go to the tub, put a blanket in there.  She might just end up passing in there.|`|sQOXjKFNaa	dogs dont have sweat glands.  She may be crawling in there to cool off!  Something is definailty wrong!  Please take her to the vet.|`|3p3otDlXaa	I would give it some pure fresh clean water.|`|iFWUhpiOaa	My friend has a dog that is real old. We think she (the dog) has Alzheimer's. When she is put down on the floor, she'll find the nearest crack or crevasse and crawl into it as far as she can get herself buried. My friend has found her in some pretty strange places. It sounds like your dog is in distress. The kindest thing for your pet would be to take her to the vet and have her put to sleep. I know it will be hard but that would be so much kinder than leaving her to hang on and suffer. I have given my friend the same advice.|`|1b229f9360a3a0af95c67051a894404faa	Agree with Pisces if yodon'tnt want to take her to the vet.-stay with her and pet her and talk to her and tell her you love her andintnt let her die alone. i know it will be hard ,just know you loved her and gave her a good home ,and when you are ready,give your love to another .|`|K7hYJAQfaa	Well most dogs when they know that they are going to die will run away from home where she is inside she may be trying to hide to pass on.
9e4cc937385b500f07dcfe521561dfc1aa	I think only if the bird seeds ALL sunflower seeds it might feel that effect..but not from couple of sunflower seeds mixed in with other seeds/pellets etc..|`|6Jtr4m3Faa	Cockatoos, eh? They are no harm for the birds but you should see the nutrition facts and see what the seeds contain or do some research on google to see what they eat. I will start you off.<br>  Fruits<br>  seeds<br>  vegetables<br>  nuts<br>  protein<br>  bean mixture <br>  table food; cheese<br>  corn<br>  cereal<br>  pasta<br>  meat etc. <br>  note: do not give cockatoos too much vitamin C or else it will ="Iron Overload Disease" as vitamin C increases the amount of iron absorbed from foods and supplements.<br>  I do hope this works for you.|`|dd29142df42d00c2832dc987bcd6b003aa	I have done a search on the composition & dietary benefits of sunflower seeds,they are of immense value both to humans as well as birds lucky enough to get them as part of their seed mix or as a treat.<br>  These seeds or rather the kernel which is the edible part after de husking are a good source of protein & also have Vitamins like E & B ,they are a source of many minerals like,potassium, calcium ,iron & zinc,all beneficial in health promotion.<br>  No where is there an ingredient that remotely will act as a drug so the 10 % can safely be given in your pets diet .|`|0e887501126bed50bff9795d128b616faa	Seeds can make up 10% of the diet, but it shouldn't be all sunflower. They are high in fat. The birds love them, but they aren't particularly good for them. They don't act as a drug, other than the birds love them so much they will eat them and nothing else if given the chance! I give them as a treat to my 'toos.|`|OP0WnHYZaa	sunflower seeds are a seed that has a very high fat content so like kids with fatty food they love them and will eat them first before anything else|`|CEgq26oHaa	I don't think so.|`|FeFuIgwCaa	No they do not.  As one previous user said, they are full of fat and therefore, the bird will eat it before all other ones because it is a quick source of rich energy.  <br>  <br>  People are told not to give their birds a lot of them because the bird will prefer the seeds to other things and will not get adequate nutrition from them.  It would be like putting a suguary snack on a plate or some bland greens that would be better for you nutritionally.  Most people would probrably take the sweet first.<br>  <br>  It will not make your bird high and wont cause it to become an addict.  It is just not good to give a bird that in the wild would eat fruit, bugs, and seeds just seeds.

3sB49YNnaa	Gestation is 10 weeks (68-72 days is most common). You don't see much for the first 3-4 weeks except perhaps some weight gain. At about a month, weight gain becomes obvious and continuous and an experienced breeder can palpate the pups. At about 6-7 weeks the sow starts to look sort of pear shaped and you can probably feel the pups by placing your hands gently on her sides. At 8-9 weeks, you can feel the pups moving. At 10 weeks, an experienced breeder can feel the pelvis dilate and delivery comes shortly after.<br>  <br>  If she is pregnant, you need to be sure she has a proper diet. You should have plenty of 18% protein guinea pig pellets with stabilized vitamin C, grass hay and fresh water in front of her at all times. Supplement this with a moderate amount of greens. <br>  <br>  Once she is clearly pregnant, if she is still with a boar remove him or he will breed the sow very shortly after she delivers. Be sure to remove any boar pups by 3 weeks as they can mate their sisters or rarely their mother shortly thereafter|`|nPdKJyK4aa	Did you accidently put a male and female together not knowing? Do it intentionally? Or buy her pregnant? I would NOT use the kitten formula. I'm not an "expert" so if you want that kind of advice you should probably bring her to a small animal/exotic pet vet ASAP. There are many variables as to weather she would live through this.

There are many "hobby" operations where someone keeps a few mares and maybe a stallion.<br>  <br>  FWIW, not all commercial breeding operations have both mares and stallions.  Some Thoroughbred breeding operations operate as "stallion stations," standing as many as 40 stallions (Gainesway farm in Lexington, at its heyday) to outside mares, and some commercial breeding operations do not stand any stallions at stud, preferring instead to own shares in/book their mares to stallions that stand at other farms, rather than going through the expense of building facilities for stallions and managing and promoting stallions.<br>  <br>  There are some breeders who don't own a farm at all.  The Phipps family, for instance, breeders of horses like Bold Ruler, Personal Ensign, and many other champions, board all their mares and stallions at Claiborne Farm, which manages the broodmare band and stallions for the Phipps family.  <br>  <br>  There are some farms in Kentucky that operate purely as boarding operations for broodmares.  They may not own a single horse that's on their property, except for a teaser stallion or two, but they may board dozens of mares and foals and manage them for many different owners.  <br>  <br>  And of course for breeds that allow the use of frozen or transported semen, you can have an artificial insemination station that does semen collections off-premises, but prepares, stores and ships the semen.  A breeding operation without live horses on the premises, if you will.<br>  <br>  With embryo transplant from frozen embryos, there's a whole brave new world of commercial breeding operations to consider, too.|`|hYRYO5GYaa	i wouldn't base it off quantity, but quality of horses if there 1 nice stud and 3 nice mares and they can produce a 30,000 dollar colt. thats a breeding farm to me, not to mention most studs also have mares brought to them, theres no telling how many of those pay just to get theres bred|`|rTSwouqXaa	I don't think its as much a matter of how horses they have as a matter of what their breeding program is trying to accomplish. It could be as little as 3 mares and 1 stud.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	I don't go by number, I go by main purpose of the farm.  If the farm's main purpose is to produce nicely conformed, well bred horses then I consider it a breeding farm.  Even if they only produce 5 foals a year, if those foals are top quality then they are a breeding farm to me.<br>  <br>  A farm that breeds but also gives lessons or something is not a breeding farm to me.  <br>  <br>  A BYB'er with 20 mares and a single stud doesn't count as a breeding farm to me.<br>  A place that gives lessons as well as breeds doesn't count as a breeding farm to me.|`|4AfRTzRmaa	ex. holistiner breeding farm: 3 stallions/6 mares  very fancy!<br>  <a href="http://www.misporthorse.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.misporthorse.com/</a><br>  <br>  ex. all horses (maninly jumper) 11mares/8? stallions Nice!<br>  <a href="http://www.elkrunfarm.com/stallions.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.elkrunfarm.com/stallions.htm</a><br>  <br>  ex. 14 mares/2 stallions (all horses) GOOD<br>  <a href="http://sonestafarms.com/breeding.htm#stallions" rel="nofollow">http://sonestafarms.com/breeding.htm#sta...</a><br>  <br>  i would have to say the lowest should be  3 stallions and 6 mares, thats not very many horses, but with awsome bloodlines :)
L4uwRphSaa	haha its not so bad, i suggest pulling his mane, i know i sounds bad, but horses litterally can't feel it, they don't have nerve endings in the root of their hair, thats why people/indians used their hair to mount! if you don't know how to pull a mane, look it up or type mane pulling on YOUTUBE.<br>  and you can control how long you want his mane and everything. and it looks cute and natural!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Steps<br>  Separate a section of your horse's mane to be pulled - about three inches. Take the remaining mane, if you think it will be in the way, and secure it with either a clip or large rubber band.<br>  Take the section of mane that you are pulling in one hand, holding the longest hairs in the section. With the comb, comb the hair in the opposite direction of growth - upwards, towards the neck, so that most of it bunches up.<br>  Take the unbunched part and wrap it around the comb, giving it a good, firm pull where you want to shorten it so that the hair is pulled out at the roots.<br>  Brush the entire section again, and repeat until all of the hair in that section is the desired length.<br>  Repeat with the rest of the mane, making sure to brush it out every so often to verify that it is even in length.<br>  Remember to praise your horse for being so patient!|`|gdH0Xmfjaa	Well he could defiantly use a trimming, it's nothing that you can't fix. I would really really recommend chopping it off, so that you have about 5 to 6 inches of main left, it's SO much easier to maintain and that way you don't have to brush it out everyday, and so on. If you've never trimmed a mane before don't do it alone get someone who knows what they are doing. Your horses mane is nice in long so you can totally fix whatever happened.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	If you trim it up some more don't use the scissors left to right (or right to left). Make them vertical and clip it like that.|`|XL62syrCaa	The best way is to go through and "pull" the mane which will shorten it a bit, but will make it more natural looking. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newrider.com/Library/Horse_Care/pulling_a_mane.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.newrider.com/Library/Horse_Ca...</a><br>  <br>  Thats the best way either that or just let it grow out.|`|3LXbUg1raa	In my opinion, from what I can see in the photo, it really doesn't look that bad...To make it look more natural, though, you can try pulling the mane or comb through the mane using a dematting comb which can give the same shortening/thinning effect as pulling the mane yet it is more tolerable to horses while still giving a more natural look to the mane...doing either of those can "fix" the mane and make it look more natural and not so blunt ended.
IddUYNR3aa	Dogs' paws are sensitive and he may be biting at you to let go because you are squeezing his paws. Or because his hind legs are tired after just a short time. Dancing With Your Dog is a choreographed routine to a song you choose. It's fun. There are web sites you can find and DVD's that show you how. You don't dance like partners. It's really cool. Look it up.|`|OFpl236faa	I've done some canine freestyle with one of my Border Collies. It's a form of dancing with your dog, but is choreographed to music.

342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Yes, massages are GREAT for dogs!  And yes, everyone was a rookie at some point, but why aren't you getting some help from your dog's breeder?  Wearing a young dog out to the point he won't move is damaging his joints!<br>  <br>  Shepherds are high energy dogs, capable of a ton of activity, but this dog also needs something to exercise his mind.  Aren't you doing any obedience with him?  Agility?  Tracking?  Herding?  Flyball?  He needs an activity to exercise his mind too.  That's one of the commitments you made when you got this breed - as well as walking - a LOT.  <br>  <br>  I've got a 9 month old Belgian shepherd puppy and he gets out for 2 or 3 walks every day, sometimes goes to the dog park, sometimes has a play date with his husky buddy.  In addition to that, he has obedience and conformation training sessions every day, as well as weekly obedience classes and handling classes - and he's still a puppy.  Your dog needs more to do to keep happy.|`|5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -<br>  Oh love...no one trainer or not should be rude.  It sounds to me like you love your dog and are totally dedicated to doing what it takes to make sure he is kept in the best of health/exercised.  I walk about 8-9 miles a day.  All the dogs I train come along with as well as my yorkie all 4.5lbs of her.  I have a stroller for the little ones to rest in every now and again and they let me know when it's time to get out and walk some more.  <br>  Your dog is telling you he can't run home...so let him walk.  He's so tired the rest of the day?  But not exhausted to the point of not eating...just showing "hey...I'm done here...time to nap" mine do the same.  This is generally the time I train them - because I deal a lot with aggressive dogs this works out best.  It brings them to a calm submissive state and they are willing to do commands and learn a lot more quickly when they don't have so much "stored up" energy.  You are hydrating your dog...so you are doing great.  As for soreness?  My dogs love a massage...but do not show signs of soreness.  If this does occur back off some and work up a bit more slowly.  <br>  Your dog is very fortunate to have someone dedicated to exercise.  Many get obese and lazy and get a lot of health problems because of it.  My vet keeps an eye not only on my own personal dog, but all the dogs that are in my care.  She is very positive about all of the exercise, weights, as well as nutrition.  I am sure I don't exercise as fast as you...but I generally have at least one extra dog if not 3 besides my own with me.  It takes me 2 1/2 hours daily.  Some people when they hear what I do explode with all sorts of exaggerated behavior about "over doing it".  But when a vet approves I think I'm on the right track.  My little one has been walking with me since she was 4 months.  When she wants to walk she does the "dance" and I let her out.  When she's needing a rest she will go ahead and look back.  When I say "up?" she sits, I scoop get a kiss and put her in the carry pack or stroller whatever I have with me.  <br>  Have fun!!  And good job on your dedication to making your dog healthy and happy.  Actually...I'm proud of you.|`|9825a4accf342d98abca06fdb35d659aaa	It sounds like plenty of exercise. Be careful about biking and having him run along side you. Dogs are very motivated to please and he may be getting too tired but keep pushing himself because he thinks that's what you want. If he is lagging on the way home it might be a good idea to shorten his exercise time. He really doesn't have anyway to tell you that he's exhausted, but if he's tired for the rest of the day I think it might be too much at one time.<br>  <br>  What I do with my puppy is give him several shorter excercise sessions spread throughout the day--a couple of walks and a couple of sessions of fetch someplace where he can run freely without being in danger. Sounds like he's a lucky dog to have you spending so much time with him though.|`|eznL5Zwvaa	If he seems happy,other then when you get home,he is just fine.He played hard and needs time to rest.I bet he got up when he saw you come through the door!!!!!|`|3p3otDlXaa	so far so good, and you probably feed him a little more back home.

AA11121172	Okay, your not going to like any of my answers.<br>  <br>  Mice are stupid, breed like rabbits, and are territorial.  Live trapping and releasing far away is still going to kill the mouse, it will just take longer and the mouse will suffer, in fights with other mice, not knowing the territory so starving or being eaten.   Cats are quick, easy way to take care of a mouse problem.  So are those traps that kill immediately.<br>  <br>  But the best thing to do is mouse proof your house.  Make sure all food is in containers a mouse cant get through.  Having the cats wlll help.  I suspect they have killed more than one mouse in your house.  <br>  <br>  Also, as a vegetarian and someone who respects life, realize that cats are made for catching mice and small rodents, and usually kill quickly (unless training kittens, or not hungry).  Also, it might help to think of the mice in your house as free range, living a very happy mouse.  <br>  <br>  Other things to consider, mice usually don't bite children.  Taking precautions with your food and other things mice might be interested in might mean you and the mice live in uneasy cohabitation.|`|hBiSNoE7aa	The best way to efficiently get rid of the mice is to cut off their food and nesting sources. I would try to segregate the cats, just so they do not catch any diseases or parasites from the mice. But you cannot really stop them from killing or eating mice. They are only doing what seems natural to them. If you do catch them in the act of biting or killing a mouse, try not to scare them, they might get bitten or choke on it. Maybe just offer them a treat or toy instead.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	you should eat the mice.<br>  <br>  im sorry .i just cant understand why you worry about this.<br>  <br>  think about this, in order to raise the vegetables for you to eat, farmers have to level forests and animals die. not to mention the cute bunnies that get chopped up by the plows just so you can be a vegetarian.<br>  <br>  cats, unlike humans, can only eat meat.<br>  <br>  let the cats murder the mice.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Either let the cats take care of the mice or YOU take care of them.  Its unhealthy to have them in your house and eating your food and leaving their mess behind.<br>  <br>  I love animals (had hamsters) but you have to draw the line somewhere.  Wild mice are not like the cute little white mice in the pet shop.  They do carry diseases and should not be living in the house.<br>  <br>  If you use a live trap and do not relocate them miles away, they will find their way back into your house.  I'd much rather kill them quickly then to let them suffer (glue traps are inhumane and should be banned from the market!).  I would use DCon and kill them quickly.  If you use DCon - be sure the kids and cats cannot get to the little bait traps.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	I would say if you can set a live trap or two go with it. Release them somewhere else and re-set the traps. In the mean time if your cats kill any more mice don't feel too bad about it. The cats are doing what domesticated cats have done since the first cat was brought into the home. Don't stop them from getting the mice it is the cats nature and denying them such an activity would confuse them.  <br>  <br>  The only thing I would worry about is the cats bringing you the dead mice, or leaving them somewhere a child could get at them.|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	Mice can carry diseases, their poop can contain the Hanta Virus which can be deadly. There are so many mice in the world that killing the ones that get into your house is not going to affect the survival of the species. Let the cats do their job and hunt them down. A big pail with a mouse walkway going in and peanut butter at the bottom can work as a live trap, cheaper than store bought too. Any pail deep enough for them not to be able to get out of will work. Also have a rodent control person come check out your house for possible places that the mice are getting in, s/he may see something you don't. Mice can squeeze through a hole about the size of a nickle. Cover any openings with metal mesh, stucco lath works really well. After you have done everything you can to stop mice from getting in, do a seasonal check of you house, fall time it's a must, just to make sure your house is still sealed.|`|NbvTyN7saa	The best thing to do is make your house as uninviting to mice to start with.  Make sure every external hole is plugged in some way.  Remember they can get into very tiny spaces.  Don't leave food out on the counters and have everything in a sealed container.  <br>  <br>  Cats are obligate carnivores so need to eat meat unlike most humans and rodents are their natural food source so trying to convince them to not hunt them will be more than a challenge to say the least.  <br>  <br>  Live traps can work but be careful. You don't want to remove a momma and have the babies left behind somewhere.|`|GqsLNUE8aa	No mouse would dare come into our home ~anymore. Lisa catches them around the garbage outside then leaves them on the doorstep. Sometimes I walk out to half a bird on the steps. My husband, who's Dad is a trapper up north (gasp! I know bothers me too) says once the mice know/smell a cat is there they will not return and they will warn all their mice friends as well. So if I were you I'd let the cats be cats. Let them show their presence and kill a few, then you'll notice you don't have mice anymore. They will leave. Before Lisa became well known by the mice in our area we had a few adventures. Once while I was in the kitchen I saw one running back and forth under every appliance as if it was a chicken with it's head cut off. I have a serious phobia of little gross things that eat garbage and are faster than me. So I jumped on top of the table and yelled for my Saviour "Lisa!!! Lisa!!! Lisa!!!" She came running so fast around the corner she missed the mouse the first time cause she slid half way thro the kitchen, caught herself and saved mommy from the little gross thing ~ she even took it outside for me, seriously! My cat is brilliant I know. I have to post a question now about Lisa and her new babies because clearly I love talking about my cats. LOL|`|vOomJtbsaa	Liseee Looo!  Let the cats eat the mice.  That way you don't have to do the dirty work.<br>  This brings to mind a story that happened to me about 3 years ago.  I lived with my younger brother, it was my very first apartment.... he was 21 and I was 23.  We were fixing the place up nicely and taking tons of pride in it.  Well we had a party one night, my cousin who can be a bit of a rascal was over and got pretty drunk.  Well the next morning I woke up to the loaf of bread sitting on the microwave being bitten through, the plastic and all.  I of course instantly blamed Brian (cousin) saying "God, if Brian wanted some bread he could've at least opened the packaged, not bitten through the entire loaf, plastic and all!!"  to my brother.... Jamie (brother) laughed and agreed with me.... saying Brian was a nutcase & it was probably him doing something stupid like that.  Well I threw the bread out, the next night the same thing happened to our bag of bagels that was sitting on top of the micro... now I know Brian wasn't there that night.  All this time we'd been blaming my dimwit cousin and Brian actually turned out to be a mouse!  LOL.  So we called the apartment manager and they came and set those sticky traps all over the kitchen cabinets with peanut butter.  Well the next night at about 3 am, I woke up to a huge banging sound and I couldn't figure out where it was coming from.... I checked to see if the back door was closed, it was closed, then I checked to see if the dogs were in Jamies room.... they were.... then I flicked on the lights to the kitchen and HOLYYYYY HELLLLL!!! There was the HUGEST RAT half stuck to the trap and the other half of it's body trying to squirm away from the trap, that was making a huge slapping sound on the kitchen counter.  So I run into my brothers room screaming hysterics.... "Jamie Jamie OMG OMG The rat, the rat!!!"  He was delirious with sleep and he's like "Beck, the dogs are in here with me, and they're fine."  I'm like "NOOOOO, the RATTTT, it's in the kitchen!!!!"  So he hops out of bed, and runs to get the rat,  grabs the trap and takes it outside onto the balcony.  All the while I'm screaming "Jamie, please don't kill it, just pull it off the trap and let it go."..... LOL!  He's like "No Beck, unless you want to take half the rats body off, it's really stuck on there."  So he grabs the broom handle sitting on the balcony and tells me to turn around and kills the poor little rat.  It let out the worst little squeak I've ever heard.  I actually went to bed that night and cried for the poor thing.  I was really saddened by seeing something killed right in front of my eyes like that.  And the little noise it let out.... pathetically heartbreaking!  So the moral of my story is, let the cats do the dirty work, you don't want to have to! :)
6b3fd330dd0ad7c1bdcb07718498e43aaa	Too bad you say no rats because they truly are the best. If you had a gerbil in the cage a rat would fit perfectly.|`|nwH5ax40aa	I say rats too, my 4 boys are brill!!!<br>  I've had 20 girls in the past and they are all amazing.<br>  But don't put them in a tank, rats get breathing problems if kept in a tank, and also not with shavings too dusty, paper based much better|`|vJRMmgd6aa	your  choices are really only hampsters or gerbils|`|BWez86Ldaa	Rodents should never be kept in glass tanks. Ammonia builds up and causes lots of respiratory problems. Perhaps do some research on all types of rodents to find the right one for you. It sounds like you're looking for a pet just because you have this extra cage; sometimes this is not the route to go, but I do commend you for no impulse buys! :) I'm not very gerbil or hammy savvy, as the ones I've dealt with in the past were rather aggressive, so between the two I can't really suggest which you should get.<br>  <br>  Martin's makes wonderful rodent-appropriate cages, and so does Midwest. Martin's has great multilevel cages, but are more difficult to clean, in my opinion. Midwest carries the Ferret Nation and Critter Nation, which are fantastic for daily cleaning, which most rodents require.<br>  <br>  If you have this empty tank, you may want to research some reptiles, if you like reps, that is. :) This would be an appropriate cage for many baby reptiles, and a good enclosure for leopard geckos.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|840nqUePaa	I highly recommend getting a new cage, and adopting rats. they are amazing, i love my ratties|`|PN7XMglOaa	a kangaroo rat|`|rIXqviz7aa	a naked mole rat
meoRbjgCaa	I have all three, and use each one for a different purpose.<br>  <br>  I ride English when I need to ride in an extended trot often and/or do a lot of collected work that requires pin point accuracy in where I'm placing my horses feet.  The shorter stirrups allow me to post comfortably at the extended trot and prepare for jumping obstacles.<br>  <br>  I ride western when I am practicing slow collected ring work and or doing gymkhana type events such as barrels or poles.<br>  <br>  I ride my aussie when I know that I am going to be in the saddle for hours and doing a lot of up and downhill cross country type riding.  I like that the longer stirrups don't bend my knee as much as in the English, yet because they have English style leathers they don't torque my knee like the western saddles. <br>  <br>  Each saddle serves a different purpose, but if I were to have one, I would probably choose the aussie because I do more trail riding then anything else.|`|RZPLec5Eaa	Rosi M probably has best answer, that was good info! <br>  <br>  For me, I'd rather ride in a jump saddle. All riding takes practice, none of it is "easy". It's whatever you feel comfy with.|`|B6zl0AJDaa	An Australian Stock saddle is like riding western in a dressage saddle.  You sit back, with your feed forward and should be able to see the toes of your boots when you look down.<br>  <br>  A Western saddle is heavier than either the Australian Stock Saddle or an English Saddle.  Once again you're sitting back, you should be able to see your toes when you look down so your legs are slightly forward.<br>  <br>  As for an English saddle, there are several types:<br>  Huntseat/Jumping where you sit slightly forward and should NOT see the toes of your boots and are made so that your stirrups are shorter than either the Australian Stock or Western Saddles so that posting is easier and that your knees should fit nicely into their kneerolls when jumping or in two point position.  The flaps are more forward to help the riders get up over the horse's shoulders when the horse is going over a jump.<br>  <br>  Dressage:  You take a deeper seat, much like the Australian Stock Saddle with longer stirrups and should NOT be able to see your toes.  The flaps are straighter than the H/J saddles, so the horses can perform the movements called for.<br>  <br>  Saddle Seat:  This is a VERY shallow seat, straight flap so the horse can easily negotiate the higher knee actions needed of a park or gaited class.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|AA11570905	I've ridden in all three and prefer the western saddle.  <br>  <br>  The Australian saddle I rode in felt as if the stirrups were too far back and was uncomfortable for my hips.  <br>  <br>  In order to ride properly in an English saddle my stirrups are shorter than is comfortable for me. <br>  <br>  I prefer my western saddle.  I ride with an almost straight leg, my knees don't hurt, and my hips are comfortable for the first 10 or 15 miles.|`|bVLwH4jlaa	There are no preferences. You may find that different horses respond better under different saddles.<br>  <br>  For example, police troops around the world use whatever saddles that suit their horses' needs.<br>  <br>  I would suggest getting in touch with a professional saddler with your questions, for a bad fitting saddle could ultimately cripple a horse.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, again, it is not a question of easier for you, it is the health of your horse that matters.|`|PWankIUpaa	You are asking a loaded question! Until my saddle was stolen I owned a Smith Worthington 4" cut back with a leather tree which in the 70s cost a thousand dollars! I loved that saddle . <br>  <br>  I never owned a silver saddle but always wanted one . <br>  <br>  Australian saddles are fine I am sure but a good Western saddle is preferable in my own humble opinion.|`|c94edb500cc7fe12b1da30dfd93db57caa	google each to look at pictures and see the differences.<br>  <br>  English saddles...<br>  A all-purpose (your typical 'english' saddle) is used for general everyday riding, you can do some jumping, flatwork... whatever you want, this saddle is a all-around good saddle for your typical horse owner.<br>  Dressage saddles are deeper cut, meaning that you sit deep in the saddle... this helps you stay in the saddle and thus communicate better with your horse through leg commands and such.  Jumping saddles have a 'forward' cut, which helps you sit forward, and helps you rise into the jumping position.  There are many different 'specific' types of English saddles, depending on what you do.  There are even saddles made specially for the game of polo!<br>  <br>  Western Saddles<br>  Western Saddles have deeper seats, helping you to stay in the saddle and stay comfortable.  They were made for ranchers and thus should be comfy for long hours.  They have longer stirrups to be more comfortable and help you stay in the saddle.  They come with a horn, which is used to tie/secure your rope... but very good for beginners to hold onto (as a note, for anyone to hold onto if you get into a rough situation!)<br>  <br>  Australian Saddles<br>  Australian saddles are a league of their own... and almost like a mix between English and Western saddles.  Again, the purpose is for comfortable long rides, and a secure seat.  Today, they come both with and without a horn.<br>  <br>  Personally I prefer English or Australian saddles, but I've never had a chance to use a western saddle that fit me well (both that I used were to large thus uncomfortable) so I suppose I am biased.  I only used an Australian saddle once and it was VERY comfortable, I really liked it.<br>  <br>  There are also racing saddles (very very light, almost no seat, as the racers don't sit while racing) endurance saddles (sort of like Australian saddles I believe -- very comfortable for long rides, but allow for more movement) and many more saddles within the subcategories of English and Western.<br>  <br>  This is a very good site to read more about specific saddles and see pictures:<br>  <a href="http://horses.about.com/od/typesofsaddles/Types_of_Horseback_Riding_Saddles.htm" rel="nofollow">http://horses.about.com/od/typesofsaddle...</a><br>  <br>  Google specific types and you'll get a lot of information... hope this gave you a good basic overview of what you wanted!

6L0tVhn7aa	Coraline is a calcareous algae that grows by encrusting onto other surfaces, why would you want it to grow on corals? this would kill the coral.<br>  If you have some Coraline on the glass (for example) you can get a sharp edged blade and scrap at it, as it comes away from the glass your powerheads will blow it around the tank effectively 'seeding' the tank as it will grow where it falls (remember to turn of your skimmer/filters for an hour).<br>  Coraline likes two things...calcium and actinic light (not white) so therefore you need to make sure your calcium levels are sufficient to support it's growth (350-450ppm) and you have a quality source of actinic light (T5 actinic lights would be good).<br>  Coraline also need good levels of Magnesium and Alkaline.|`|zOtiAN3xaa	I had it everywhere!

That works well. <br>  <br>  BTW, coraline is nice but it's a pain down the road.

You need good (actinic) lighting, and you need high calcium and KH levels for good coralline algae growth. We aren't talking about slime, or diatoms, coralline algae is calcified, and hence hard. It usually takes time, and grows best in a mature tank. It also needs to be seeded. If you have some live rock with it, and the conditions are favorable, you will get coralline algae.

ak9DrBSwaa	Rabbits do NOT stink. They can also be litter box trained.<br>  <br>  Look up "House Rabbit Society" and find a branch in your area.<br>  <br>  If the choice is a rabbit in an outside cage or no rabbit, the humane thing to do is to have no rabbit.<br>  <br>  Another posters cage recomendation - good god, please no. Do not ever keep rabbits, or any other animal on a wire floor in a cage. It's CRUEL. Want to test it out - go buy wire mesh at the feed or hardware store and cover your house's floor with it and walk around barefoot  for any lenth of time. Also, cedar is a horrible respiratory irritant for small animals. It's far better to use aspen bedding rather than cedar and pine.|`|76nTvO4iaa	We had bunnies for years.  They lived in the house. <br>  <br>  One was litter box trained and was allowed free run of the house.  My kids just dumped the litter box every other day & changed it.<br>  <br>  The other one was antisocial and stayed in his cage all the time.  The cage had a removable tray on the bottom that we kept cedar chips (bought by the bushel at the farm store) in.  They dumped and rinsed the tray every other day & refilled it with chips.<br>  <br>  Here's the kind of cage we had:<br>  <a href="http://www.bassequipment.com/files/images/content/cover2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.bassequipment.com/files/image...</a>|`|hQQuqyYcaa	I really would not recommend it unless it doesn't get above 85F in your area. Rabbits are extremely sensitive to heat. They can be in temperatures as low as 20F, though. But they can die quickly with temperatures above 85F. Do a bunny a favor and do not get one just because you want one. If you can't provide housing in cool temperatures, then please don't keep one outside. It's possible to get bored quickly with rabbits outside too, sometimes. They don't bond as well, usually not as friendly, and it gets difficult to keep them comfortable.|`|5hzVSugmaa	I wouldn't do it.  Nevada can get very hot (like California, which is where I am)  Rabbits already have a naturally higher body temperature than humans, (somewhere over 100 degrees I believe) and with all that fur, heat can easily kill them, even if they are in a shady place on a hot day.  I keep my rabbit inside during the summer, because it gets way over 100 some days.  I only put her back outside in a playhouse that I made as nice little rabbit hutch/house for her when it is steadily under 85 degrees, preferably 80.  And even then they must still be in constant shade, like under a nice tree, AND they must have some sort of ventilation.  If they are in the sun, (even if they are in the shade of their hutch) they temperature will crawl to a very high temperature, probably above what the temperature outside is, and it will stay like that untill it cools down considerably.  Plus, when you have a hutch outside, you have to take into account weather.  The roof of your hutch must be slanted so that water can run off it and it must be rasied off the ground so that bugs and other little rodents won't eat things.  AND you MUST have a securely latched/locked door.  Things like racoons are very smart and they will hurt your rabbit.<br>  <br>  Rabbits CAN handle cold though.  They actually do quite fine with it.  (you must make sure they are extra warm if it happens to be snowing, even take them inside if you have to).  Just don't keep them in the warm house, then stick them outside in the cold weather the next day.  If you want to let them live outside in the winter, then start them outside in the fall when it's around 65 degrees or so, so that they can get their body used to the cold.  If you just stick them out there in freezing weather, it will shock them.<br>  <br>  Rabbits are a huge responsibility and require a lot of attention and time to freely run around out of their cage every day.  They get very expensive, and if you haven't already, maybe start with a smaller animal like a hamster, then work your way up to a rat, then maybe a rabbit if you feel you are ready.  They are very great pets though and have wonderful personalities, and you can easily train them to use a litterbox like a cat would, and I think you could definately control the smell to make it almost nothing if you clean out the litterbox once or twice a week.  I really reccomend keeping the rabbit inside full time, because when you keep them outside, you tend to pay less attention to your rabbit, and your rabbit won't bond with you like it would if it were inside.  Plus, they love to be in places where people are walking past their cage throughout the day.  Both you and your rabbit will be happier if the rabbit is indoors.|`|ZxLzNWvkaa	yes they can live out side but not in the winter time.<br>  they love munching on the grass!<br>  just make sure they have a little shelter house or something they can get always from the rain or sun.<br>  and make sure the cage is be anough for them.<br>  there not actually that stinky you just need to clean their cage every week.<br>  i suggest you buy a book on rabbits before you get one, it would be a lot easy for you to under stand what kind of habitat they need.|`|hYRYO5GYaa	unless is was in an insulated cage where wind and weather couldnt bug it at all. bunnys are  very sensitive to cold and hot weather. if its to hot they die, if its to cold they die.
JFuVm9k5aa	okay i totally disagree with giving him a "jab" in the mouth or pulling the reins so hard!!! the problem sounds like the horse may have a hard mouth so by ripping on the horses mouth probably wont fix anything. the horses mouth is a delicate place, you should never do such a thing to a horse who is trusting you every time they let you stick the cold hard metal object in their mouth and then you go and jab them with it?<br>  <br>  anyway, have her teeth been checked recently? try that...that could be a big problem if not looked at.<br>  <br>  the saddle fit could easily be the problem depending on when this arose. did it JUST happen or has it been forever and in any saddle? if it has been forever then yes the saddle fit is someting that needs to be addressed but not the root of her problem...necessarily.<br>  <br>  if you cannot get in control enough once you get cantering to circle....try having someone lunge her with you on her. not really to do anything but to be "back up breaks" per say. you can also try a different, stronger bit, or even a hackamore. hackamores did wonders for a few horses i knew that had no respect for stopping. with a stronger bit though..it will probably only mask the problem and inevitably make it worse. the hackamore will also help if her problem is her teeth or mouth etc.<br>  <br>  you say she is good at the walk and trot so i am not sure it makes sense it is the bit or saddle. because if the saddle was enough to make her really bolt then it should show up even mildly in the trot. and with the bit...she should always be bad about taking the bit etc.<br>  <br>  a kimberwick isnt a bad idea. but i do think you need to be sure of what is causing this behavior before ADDING things. it may be her saddle so changing the bit may make the problem worse etc.<br>  <br>  i hope i helped. i would try and have a vet out to check her teeth, fit the saddle and give her a physical evaluation to see if there is somehting causing pain or inhibiting her ability at the canter.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck and be careful!|`|u45B1OYiaa	maybe you should try hard sharp half haults?|`|FcR8G8hPaa	Your horse probably has a combination of training problems. Neither stronger bits or lunging your horse meaninglessly to exhaustion will help. Starting at the beginning, you need to get good stop responses every time on lead line and lunge. <br>  <br>  Yank the lunge rope repeatedly if the horse is not responsive to down transitions and whoa on the lunge, and don't stop until he drops gait or halts.<br>  <br>  Under saddle, you are probably worried about speed and are holding the reins too tightly all the time as a result. This is devaluing the reins as a stop cue. You will need to loosen your grip on the horse's mouth to begin to reinstate the value of the reins as stop.<br>  <br>  Then you need to get his stop working at every gait, walk first, trot second, canter last. Open legs, say whoa and only if the horse doesn't respond, tug or alternate tug the reins but do not hold them tight, until the horse stops. Get this really good at the walk before moving to trot.<br>  <br>  Now you need to reinforce speed control at walk, trot and canter. Each time the horse rushes for even a stride, you need to take him to the stop (from the walk) or the next speed down (from any other gait). Of course, for this to work, the horse needs to stop well at the walk. That is the foundation of success. Once the horse has speed control at the walk, you can move to trot, and then, when consolidated very strongly at trot, you can move to canter.<br>  <br>  Remember that at the canter, the horse is close to his flight response and all his learned responses are weakened. Pain in his mouth or pressure in his mouth will cause him to instinctively run through the bit and he will not be able to respond to the aids becuase he essentally can't hear them. Your pressure on his mouth disappears into his fear. So, when this happens, you need to relax the reins first (this is very scary and counter intuitive) and then you need to alternate pulling on one rein and then the other. Gently or you will increase his pain and fear and lose even this as a control.<br>  <br>  You can also start to turn the horse, ideally with your legs if he will respond to those. If you have to use the reins do so lightly or you will increase his pain and fear.<br>  <br>  A horse cannot go fast at the canter and do a small circle at the same time, but you have to be careful not to unbalance him or tip him over. Gradually spiral into the small circle and then hold it. He will become calmer if you can do this, and when he does, you can slow him to a trot and stop.<br>  <br>  You may have to do this many times to help the horse retrain to the slower speed the small circle requires. At some point, if he is consistently going slower in the circle, you can let him out to go straight, but will want to slow him to the trot or turn him to the circle again if he speeds up.<br>  <br>  This is a complex effort that takes a lot of patience and timing. Ideally, the help of a horse trainer is better than going it alone.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes to you and your horse.|`|NevKx5fzaa	horses can carry on average 75% out of their boby mass. i have a pony same size and does the exact same thing!!! u are NOT to heavy. i think she might be opening her moulth  and refusing the bit contact. after i canter my pony i feel like i am going to die but gthe trick is BREATHE!! count strides if u have 2! i am afraid i cant be much help since i am in the same situation! i would try lunging her for a half hour before u ride. remember the most important thing is ur safety and is she WON"T stop simply bail. Remember BREATHE!! I hope i could help a little.|`|gdH0Xmfjaa	There is a horse at my barn with a similar problem - he doesn't have any "breaks", but in all fairness he isn't trying to run away with you he just won't stop. What you need to do is keep checking him up, imagine there is a line; once you cross it that's when he "GOES!" - don't let him cross that line. Whenever you feel like he's about to, check him up with your right rein again and again, if he still isn't listening give him a sharp jab in the mouth till he starts to listen.<br>  <br>  If he's running away with you in a western saddle vs. an english saddle won't make much of a difference. So just stay with the english. If he rushed into the canter w/ his last owner, your weight is obviously not the problem. Try the things i told you, they should work.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|4AfRTzRmaa	First of all, your not heavy for her. There could be a few problems. <br>  1. Saddle (highly doubt but it might be uncomortable invest in a saddle fit pad-what i use)<br>  2. wrong bit (my horse used to do the same thing, even though i am still looking for the right bit its getting better)<br>  3. back to the basics (maybe she never had enough ground work and just needs some work, try on a lunge line be for you ride the canter)<br>  4. trust (some times trust is a big issue for horses, spend time with her-im sure you have-but if you havent, that might solve the problem\<br>  5. testing your strength ( my horse just always used to dive in when i was riding him on the rail. It was the same as you sweetie in a walk and trot but in a canter it was terrible you would spin him around-nothing-but after continus times to riding and teaching him NO he finally got it)<br>  <br>  good luck :)<br>  hope this helps

Poison dart frogs are very sensitive as well.|`|CtK04QcVaa	No, they will die and you'll melt the tank with the heat lamps you'll need.<br>  Most frogs need a minimum tank size of 29 gallons.

That tank could not hold any frogs. If you were to get a ten gallon tank you could get a few african dwarf frogs.

N9SZX5mOaa	What's a leach? Just kidding with ya. <br>  <br>  One thing that is good is to just have the leash on him ALL the time. Let him drag it around the house. If he loves food, get a special kind of treat that he ONLY gets when he is on the leash. Be patient. It will take some time. Also try clicker training him. This will really help encourage him not to be afraid of the leash. <br>  <br>  Best of luck!! =)|`|HXVaqUjXaa	Let him drag it around. Just put it on and let him go. Do not leave him unattended in case he should get caught up somewhere. But if he does get caught don't run to get him loose. Just wait till he quits fighting the leash then calmly untangle him and let him go again. Another thing to do to hasten the training is to step quietly on the leash as he passes by. Again, don't step off the leash till he quits fighting. A couple days of that and your on your way.|`|8ebb09b16f5ff1a5448d5eab3b4b1fa4aa	Well, I am afraid of leaches so I cannot give advice on that.

tMlwcim8aa	1 Gallon? I'm sorry I very much detest putting any fish regardless of size in anything less than 3 Gallons.. but for fish recommendation? Absolutely look at Guppies. They have a wide variety of spectacular colors and patterns, so you can individually identify and name them , that's always fun. They are very peaceful and placid, and the males are usually 1 - 1.5" While the females are larger usually 1.5 - 2.5" You need a larger tank, although one gallon will support a single Guppy, you should get around a 3 or 5 gallon, for the health of the fish. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|4TcgAVgEaa	One gallon is appropriate for one guppy, two max with filtration. This is unfair however as they are schooling fish and feel safe in numbers<br>  <br>  Really, no fish should have to live is such a small space. Imagine living, eating, pooing, and peeing your entire life in a broom closet.<br>  <br>  Aquariums are cheap. Buy at least a 10 gallon and a good beginner fish keepers book.<br>  <br>  I think this is a great one:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Simple-Guide-Fresh-Water-Aquariums/dp/0793821010/ref=pd_bbs_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235702615&sr=8-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Simple-Guide-Fresh...</a>|`|e9gXZsKxaa	One gallon is too small for fish even for the most abused fish, the siamese fighting fish.....|`|SA5DeRpUaa	put some daphnia in it there, not fish. you could keep a few and their interesting.|`|AA11708471	1 gallon is too small for any living thing|`|bDPVRtCNaa	It all depends on tank size.<br>  <br>  ~I'm sorry, but I strongly recommend that you return that tank.

zqVDJxUIaa	Your tank is still undergoing the cycling process since you completely cleaned out your tank.<br>  <br>  Aquarium cycling is the process that is used to grow a colony of what is known as good bacteria, in an aquarium.  Good bacteria is essential to all aquariums because it literally eats waste products, which would otherwise build up and injure, sicken, or kill the  inhabitants (pets) in the aquarium.<br>  <br>  In a freshwater aquarium, there are two kinds of essential good bacteria.  The first kind breaks ammonia down into nitrites, and the second kind breaks the nitrites down into nitrates.  In the normal cycle, aquatic pets go to the bathroom in their own house.  They urinate and excrete directly into the water.  It would be the same as you or I urinating or excreting into the air, in our very own houses.  For the aquarium inhabitants, the most harmful waste product is ammonia.  Nitrites are also very harmful to the inhabitants, but not as harmful as ammonia.  Nitrates, in large quantities, are also harmful to the inhabitants, but not nearly as harmful as either ammonia, or nitrites.<br>  <br>  It is important to cycle an aquarium before you add any aquatic pets that you have hope of keeping, in good health.  This is important because in a brand new aquarium, there are not any good bacteria present.  When the inhabitants urinate and excrete, the waste builds up much faster than good bacteria can grow, and ammonia and nitrites damage the gills of the inhabitants, and frequently kill the inhabitants before good bacteria can grow.  Even if the inhabitants survive the ammonia and nitrite spikes which occur before cycling is complete, their gills may be damaged to the point that their lives are terribly painful, and unhealthy.<br>  <br>  As for the algae, the best way to prevent and control it is to remove your aquarium from sunlight, plant some plants (they compete for nutrients with algae), and get an algae eating species such as the Siamese Algae Eater (flying fox) or a pleco. Also, controlling nitrite will help.<br>  <br>  -Perform 20-30% water changes every two days<br>  -Gravel vacuum every two days along with changes<br>  -Clean out the algae, get an algae eating species<br>  -Optional* Use Cycle(available at most fish stores) to establish    beneficial bacteria colonies<br>  <br>  The cycling process can take anywhere from 2 to 5 weeks.<br>  Avoid adding excessive quantities of fish during this period.<br>  <br>  Good Luck~|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Yes, your tank is still cycling.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://aquatropicalfish.wordpress.com/2009/02/19/fishless-cycle/" rel="nofollow">http://aquatropicalfish.wordpress.com/20...</a>|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Yes, it's because it's still cycling|`|4TcgAVgEaa	Be sure to do regular water changes.<br>  <br>  Monitor your water chemistry<br>  <br>  Do not over stock.<br>  <br>  Hopefully you rinsed the new gravel VERY well|`|AA11925457	wate about a mounth then graval vacume the tank and add some aqua clear and it should help|`|ElyP5kLMaa	Yes ur tank is Cycling.
B6zl0AJDaa	It sounds like there are cattle people answering this question. LOL<br>  <br>  Young horses will ALSO chew off a horse's tail...FYI.<br>  <br>  If there's NOT enough grazing land where the animals are kept, the sheep could be looking for more to eat besides just hay.<br>  <br>  Time to section off the pasture and let some of it grow sounds like.|`|Bxewx4afaa	I do not know why but, it's not a very a good idea to put a horse out <br>  with sheep. <br>  Sorry if I'm not very good answer but I've seen that happen before<br>   It's not a pretty sight.|`|6EP7ILr3aa	Proberably thought it was grass. Just remember that sheep are not smart, the opposite actually. The horse might have flicked her tail at it and the sheep grabbed on. My dad never kept sheep on our farm because of them being so damn stupid. Personally I would never keep a horse in with sheep. Its unhealthy, sheep poo everywhere and if your not carefull the horse can ingest some and get ill. I would get your friend to move her horse. Also keeping horses in with sheep can hurt the sheep, they are fradgile and if the horse rears or gallops around they could get knocked over and/or get a heart attack.|`|PWankIUpaa	Why did you not have the tail braided and up so the sheep would not eat it?   Sheep eat anything but horses tails are a particular delight!<br>  <br>  Seriously keep the tail up if you like a long tail . The sheep are curious and like a cat will play with anything . A long tail is just too delicious to ignore.|`|3wIZiZA5aa	My friends sheep did this to their horses also. Idk why they do that, they just do though, and the horses stand their and let the sheep eat it.|`|Hwybmzg5aa	because sheep are stupid and evil|`|gDAqEfMoaa	well like someone above said horses will do this to but not only young horses  aged horses may chew tail's colt's and fillies are just more apt to do so cattle will also chew horses tail's usually when a horse receives this type of um mm haircut it's Always above the hocks so you will see allot of horses with cattle with short tail's sheep tend to eat there pasture mates tail's out of boredom or the horses long thick tail just looks Delicious also sheep do eat EVERYTHING so anyone of those reason's i don't think it's really a scientific problem but more of a nature problem sorry this happened to your friend's horse but i would tie  what's left up and bag it also there is some product's you can apply to the tail kind of like the stop chew for fences to curb tail eating it has worked well for me here is the website  <a href="http://www.smartpakequine.com/ProductClass.aspx?productclassid=6064&cmPreserveSource=true&cmPreserveCategory=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.smartpakequine.com/ProductCla...</a> hope this help's and good luck!|`|igrMkjU2aa	Because sheep eat everything?|`|87CMq5uqaa	Their probablly isn't enough grass so they are resorting to other things.
EcgO4dlnaa	My best suggestion is to get a shelter dog.<br>  To me they are the most loving caring dogs you can get.<br>  There is no such thing as a dog who doesn't shed. But luckily there are dogs who do not shed much at all.<br>  Such as a poodle. They are dogs who have hair as opposed fur. <br>  Hair sheds less then fur.<br>  I would get a dog because they tend to be more affectionate.<br>  If you are going to get a puppy I would suggest waiting until summer unless someone can be with the dog to let him or her out.<br>  <br>  A good running yet low shedding dog is a basenji.<br>  I will say that they are loud dogs. <br>  If you don;t mind having a loud dog then a basenji would be good.<br>  <br>  Your best bet would be a mutt because they can have many traits. A lot are very energetic.<br>  <br>  <br>  Well good Luck.<br>  and <br>  Have fun with your new pet.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. Do NOT get a dog from a breeder. We have enough unwanted dogs in this world. We don't need any more. Adopt from a shelter. Best thing I ever did. <br>  Oh and Petfinder is a great way to find shelters near you.|`|w9mK2uuyaa	I prefer a dog, but they do crave attention. Cats, i don't like so much. Mainly because they look cute but i find them vicious. for as dogs that dont shed check out this site. <a href="http://www.gopetsamerica.com/dogs/dogs-that-do-not-shed.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.gopetsamerica.com/dogs/dogs-t...</a>|`|UE4WbmtQaa	dog, obviously if your posting this in the dog section your leaning toward that anyway, and you should get a labradoodle. they're mixes, obviously, and they dont shed and like to take a good jog twice a day.|`|KuUx34hCaa	I think a Standard Poodle would be an excellent dog for you Boxers are great but they do shed some & my first choice would be Boxer but I understand the shedding problem & I have had both|`|AA11881627	Well if you mom doesn't want an animal that doesn't shed then you probley want a Dog. <br>  Plus you can't walk a cat unless u really want to by getting a collar and a leash( which they do have some).<br>  Anyway, for what you guys want you guys probley should get a dog. <br>  But the down for a dog is that they get bored REAL easy. So you might want to kept it active like kept it outside in a fenced area.|`|YVjmzAtQaa	I would get a cat. There very calm end easy to take care of. Dogs can sometimes be out of control. Cat can go crazy at times. Dogs always want to be near you a have all the attention and cats just like to be played with a few times. Cats are light sleepers and sleep all the time. They go to sleep at the darkest hours. I would get another cat. maybe you know them better.|`|IHEdxoIpaa	GATO! way easier to take care of...TRUST ME.<br>  <br>  oh yeah just in case, gato means cat.|`|oyCq6oG0aa	standard poodle, irish water spaniel...i would stick with a medium to large dog if you are a runner.|`|1m3Qwfd1aa	dog because cats scratch to much and their not cute and luvable like a dog is|`|bIaywrBCaa	since you are very active and want a running partner, a medium sized active dog like a border collie, an australian shepherd, may be good for you. I have a neighbor who walks at least 10 miles a day with her irish setters and then walks 10 more miles without them....lol Very active lady and dogs. Not sure how much they shed.<br>  <br>  btw all dogs shed and people are almost always allergic to the dander not the hair if you are worried about allergies.|`|wSc7ZdBCaa	If "we" examine you statement closely... you recently lost your cat. <br>  It sounds like you were used to "cat(s)" and that you apparently liked/loved having the one you lost.<br>  <br>  If there's no one home to exercise the dog (let it out to go potty) for most of the day...if you have a busy life and could only spare running time basically with a dog....then, it would seem you've answered your own question.<br>  <br>  I suggest you visit a shelter and pick out TWO compatible felines. They will keep each other company during the alone hours, give each other exercise with playing together, and be low maintenance.<br>  <br>  They need food, water, clean litter and some stroking and attention when it's convenient to them.  ;)<br>  <br>  If you're going to go for a dog: go on the web and type in...<br>  non-shedding dogs. You will be amazed how many dogs will appear under this heading.<br>  <br>  Some are more low maintenance than others. Some are more adapted for running. When you've found a dog that seems to have the kind of characteristics that you  might like...visit a recommended breeder of that particular breed. Your vet can help you locate one and there are usually Dog Clubs for all breeds. These people are dedicated to improving and promoting their particular breed. They will usually be happy to answer any and all questions, make recommendations, give advice and support.<br>  <br>  Wishing you great success in finding just the right 4 legged friend for you and your family.<br>  <br>  P.S. Another person suggested shelter dog(s). Yes, that's a viable option I meant to suggest and forgot. When you find the dog you want there will usually be that breed available at a shelter near you. If you let them know what you are looking for ...most will put you in their book and call you when they have one they thing you'll like. Others are so busy they cannot take the time to do this. These you will need to contact on a  regular basis to inquire about the dog you are interested. If you do go this way, visit the dog for awhile, spend some alone time (they usually have rooms for this). If information is available about the dogs prior history that might be of help and interest. Basically, if this is the way you go you'll more than likely find the "perfect" dog for you and be doing a wonderful service for the dog(s) you adopt. Good Luck!!!
f6ef4ef7ff85e3bd8d00ae20e599f9d4aa	The routine of a puppy is to wake up, go pee, eat, go pooh...then wrestle with a sibling until they fall asleep. To teach your pup to 'listen' to you, you're going to have to catch them in their 'lets play' mode. <br>  <br>  Remember, when playing games it's best to 'feel' successful, like 'Hey 'I'm good at this' or 'I won" !  Its no fun to play with someone if you have to lose all the time. Play involves taking turns...<br>  <br>  One last suggestion, end the games, while he still wants to play. This will help to shape that 'attention' your after.|`|u6IsnkBoaa	I suggest using treats and keep the training up everyday. Poodles are very smart creatures. Use lots of praise. One thing I used to do with my dogs, especially because I had one who had a hard time coming back to me at first, I put treats in a plastic container and shook it when ever I wanted them to come. They associate the sound of the container shaking with a reward so they come running. <br>  <br>  So in short, use treats and praise, and train everyday. He will get it, promise.|`|WWhYCAbSaa	"I know that he's very smart because I was able to teach him to sit in 5 minutes of training.(he will only sit when he feels like it)"<br>  <br>  Then he isn't trained.<br>  <br>  Training takes months to complete.  You have to be 100% consistent and have the patience of a saint.<br>  <br>  See if you can enroll him in puppy obedience classes.|`|G2tWnCs2aa	Well try to find a treat that your Poodle really likes...My dog loves peanuts and Zukes.<br>  Sometimes if she/he doesn't listen you can clap...Or make a high pitch noise to get their attention.|`|Bpua42Apaa	maybe he's deaf|`|wbKjfiGTaa	poodles are dumb y did u get 1|`|3giaPYe8aa	You trained him to sit in 5 minutes, but he only sits when he feels like it?  Well now, that's what I call trained.....He' 8 1/2 weeks for god's sake, not 6 months.  Maybe that' the reason why.  Heck, I've been training my husband for 35 years and he only does things when he wants to, as well.  I guess the training starts going backwards when you are in your 60's, vs. just a youngin'!|`|AA10346150	Try using treats as "bait". This usually works a lot better than clickers. Don't forget to actually give him the treat every so often while training and supply plenty of water.<br>  <br>  Happy training :)|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Because he's a BABY.  You wouldn't expect a 2 year old human to behave like an older child or an adult.  And you can't expect perfect obedience from a 2 month old dog, no matter how smart he may be.  His attention span is VERY short right now.  While you certainly can, and should, start teaching such a young puppy the basics of obedience and manners you can't expect too much from him just yet.  His sit isn't going to be competition-level (or even consistent) for MONTHS yet.  <br>  <br>  As for why he "doesn't respond to clicker training," I seriously doubt you've had him long enough for him to truly understand the game yet.  At this point you should still be working on associating the sound of the click with the treat...not using it to mark specific behaviors.  Sign yourself up for a clicker training class.  There's a LOT more to clicker training than just clicking the clicker to get your dog to do what you want.  A trainer will be able to help you trouble shoot (most of the time the problem is your timing...you aren't clicking the behavior that you think you are because you are clicking just a second or two too soon or too late) and teach you the finer points of clicker training.|`|764Hudunaa	hes a 8 week puppy, he wont listen, thats like expecting a 6 month old child to listen, it doesnt happen. he will give it time and be consistent. give him a small treat when he does.|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	Because he is 8 1/2 weeks old!  You are expecting too much too soon.  Just be consistent in training.  He is still very young.  You must train daily or they will forget.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Probably because hes only 8.5 weeks old?|`|d7bJIgqlaa	Sounds like my puppy at that age. We had a trainer come to the house and we also took her to a group obedience class. They say use treats alot for training and getting the puppy to do what you want. Always have it so the puppy can see it. Then, eventually (more than weeks) you can just put treats in your pocket and he/she will learn that you usually have a treat on you and then eventually you can go treatless, although it would be nice to share every now and then. :) Good luck!|`|f06Sy0dfaa	Most pups that old are too busy with their environment to listen to their owners. If you were using hand signals for him to sit, it was easier to him to learn. The only thing I can think of with the clicker, it may be possible that your dog is partially deaf. Try using more hand signals when teaching him. Use dog treats to encourage good behavior. Soon, he will get the idea, I do this... I get that...<br>  Don't worry, have patience with him. He'll get better.|`|zzvDybEiaa	Dogs do not understand language.<br>  <br>  Watch the Dog Whisperer (Caesar Milan) on TV, Fri Nights 8:00 PM ET / PT / National geographic.<br>  <br>  Go to his web site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/dogwhisperer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/dogwhisper...</a><br>  <br>  Be consistent, have the pup do a simple skill and reward. each and every time.<br>  <br>  The problem is usually the owners creation.<br>  <br>  This is a puppy dog, not a dog that's old enough to be trained for the movies.|`|z2cysiEhaa	He's still a baby.

280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Okay, this article includes diagrams that illustrate play fighting versus genuine aggression:<br>  <a href="http://www.ratbehavior.org/RatPlay.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ratbehavior.org/RatPlay.htm</a><br>  <br>  Was Flea's hair poofed out, kind of like a scared cat's? Did he ever approach Biscuit sideways? Was there any hissing? Did he try to bite Biscuit's rump? These are signs of aggression.<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like they were just going through the regular dominance rituals, and boxing/playing. Watch for aggression, and bloodshed. A widely-accepted rule is, "No blood, no foul." Actually, in fact, I don't even think they're really going through dominance rituals. At three months old, well, I think the little goofs are just roughhousing and playing. <br>  <br>  Next time, I'd recommend washing them both with an unscented baby wipe before you put them together. Then, put a few drops of vanilla extract (not the fake stuff) on their backs. This is to make them smell alike, like they're already part of the same colony. <br>  <br>  Place a saucer or small bowl of something really yummy down with them. This is to distract them from beating each other up, and instead redirecting them to bond while eating. You can use whatever, like pudding, yogurt, baby food or Cool Whip.<br>  <br>  You may or may not want to switch their cages. I know several people who wish they hadn't bothered. Their rats were obviously agitated and nervous because they were unquestionably in another rat's territory.<br>  <br>  Remember to thoroughly scrub Flea's cage before you put them both in it together. Scrub it down, wash all the hammocks and furniture, replace the bedding, et cetera, so it's like they're both starting anew together in it.|`|f12Uz4bRaa	You could get them nuetered<br>  or you could join a ratforum and ask them (they're really nice and helpfuul :))<br>  goosemoose.com<br>  ratforum.com<br>  ratclub.org

If they are bedded on hay, it could be possible that they are irritated by mites. Check the fur, if it comes out in small bunches with a cluster of dried skin at the end it is most likely to be a mite problem. Best solution is to take them to the vet where they will either give an injection of Ivermectin over a course of several weeks or a pain free spot-on treatment, which you may also be able to purchase in your local pet store (though these are not always as effective).<br>  There are also several medicated shampoos available for small animals which may help to curb the problem, but please consult a vet before trying numerous remedies, as your cavy may have a reaction to these products.

juyA6HUJaa	You could try get a piece of their favourite food, maybe some fruit or carrot... and move slowly and try get the guinea pig to eat from your hand if not you could always just leave a bit and when it goes to eat it grab it, it doesnt sound nice but thats what people in pet shops do... grab them quickly then place it on your knee and try to get it to calm down and sit for a while giving it lots of attention and treats, It's the only way really, try talking to it too so that it learns your voice|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	I do not like that thought that you will have to grab at them but they have developed  a habit that you need to change. The good old towel trick always works. Fold a towel in half (i use towels as their nails do not get caught in the fabric) and set the guinea pig on it. Fold the towel around it as if you were to rap a baby. Hold it to your chest over your heart, the sound and feeling of your heart is comforting to them. I found it was easiest to lie down with them and fold the towel back so they could make eye contact with you, pet the towel thus you are petting them through the towel. Talk or sing softly to them and they will stay there until they have to potty which in the beginning is about 20 minutes. They will start to wiggle about or some actually talk to you when they need to go back to the cage to potty, give them a 15 minute break and start over. Since you have 2 why don't you cuddly one this way then the other, the more often you do this in a day the faster they tame down and look forward to being cuddled. Depending how much fun you wish to have with them you can go from this to teaching them to run under a light blanket with you, well you don't run, your are under the blanket also! Pull your knees up so you make like a little tent under them and they will soon want to play under the blanket with you and run up and down the bed.They like to do little figure eights under your knees. Once they get this wired they will run until they need to take a nap. It is such fun i promise you.|`|4b5106290d0dd7b8527192088f2ec6b6aa	Ok, first---remember what you are dealing with--a prey animal! Most guinea pigs NEVER completely get over the instinct to jump and run from anything trying to "capture" them.<br>  <br>  Secondly, some piggies are easier to tame than others. They all have different personalities--some are more high strung, others are more laid back.<br>  <br>  Having said that, keep trying. You may never get to the point with the skittish one that she will let you reach in the cage and pet her...and then again, you might! You can still take her out and pet her in your lap. :)|`|Z9xy3Mwxaa	its never to late to tame an animal cause i had a female guinea pig that was scared of all people and i had to handle her alot and she opened up alot

5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -<br>  Yes love, I have had dogs who are terrified of thunderstorms.  I have always made it a habit to leave the easy listening music on for my dogs even when it's not storming out...when I am gone.  It helps eliviate anxiety because when the music is on they know it's nap time and I will be back when nap time is over.  The dogs stay in my room...have toys their beds/and my bed, food and water.  They choose to nap.  <br>  It's great that you came up with the music idea...no one I have ever met thinks it's "normal" that I do this.  But like you can tell...it works.  I don't leave on the radio or tv so that no "strange voices" will cause anxiety.  You are a smart one!!  :)|`|4zp6Uz2Haa	I suggest benadryl.  1 cap 25mg per 25-50 lbs of body weight.

Trotting makes them use their bodies more. The higher fence you trot, the more the horse has to work to go over it. Then try a few solid or scary fences.

Your horse will put in more effort.|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	Sounds like you need to work with him more on the flat and figure out how to get him off his forehand, then carry that over to jumping.<br>  <br>  As far as jumping exercises, grid work would probably be the best way to go.|`|xGPRaEOWaa	I think I know what you mean, if I were you I would try slowing him down, or collecting him before the jump so it gives him time to think. don't let him rush to the jump and don't use boots on him for a while so that if he knocks his legs he'll get the message.|`|zYVCJRMXaa	Uneed to sit back not not slamming the saddle, almost in a half seat and small half halt to rock him back, he is on the forehand and needs you to help rock him back.<br>  <br>  I have/work with a pony who does that.|`|AnX8QHgHaa	I would concentrate on his flat work.  He needs to fully understand extension and collection on the flat before you can expect him to do it over fences.|`|waoh4KUZaa	School him to slow down and collect. He's getting all strung out, which really affects their jumping. When you're schooling the courses, have him halt after every jump, then ease back into the canter and take the next one. break it up. When he's just doing it all, its easy to just get quick. make him stop and think for a minute.|`|gdH0Xmfjaa	Maybe it's just a tucking problem. The way i was taught to make a horse tuck his legs was to get a solid fence, and make him free jump it. If he hits his hooves on that he will be tucking those legs for every jump next time. You could also try collecting him before he gets to the jump, adding a few more strides - see how that works.|`|m9ypuTViaa	if he gets strung out, circle before the jump and get into a nice collected canter. if you get him collected before each jump, he will soon learn to stay nice and collected through a whole course of jumps. if you let him get away with it then he will always do it
gdH0Xmfjaa	In hunters dark tack is defiantly liked - but it depends on the color of the horse usually, then sometimes it doesn't matter.

bDPVRtCNaa	Of course it is bad. It means too much waste, and overcrowding. It's not fair to the fish. <br>  I have a twenty gallon tank and I would classify it as a small aquarium.

DO NOT get any more fish! The fish you have may die soon or get diseases, because water quality will be very poor, which leads to death, or disease and then death. A 20 gallon can only handle about 20 inches of fish (approximately) though thirty is about the maximum. You say you can't buy another tank and you don't want to get rid of your fish, so why do you want to buy more? This will be fatal for your fish. Give as many back to the pet store as possible, except a few. At least half of your fish need to go, if not more.|`|AA10616287	When you say that the total length of fish is about 60-75 inches, do you mean the total amount of space of all the fish together?  If so, that is a major problem in itself.  A standard 20 gallon tank is only about 30 inches long.  That's over 2 feet of area that the fish are cramped up in.  Also, the amount of waste that many fish produce in tight quarters is going to be so much that your ammonia levels are bound to be outrageous.  You may have a lot of fish now, but they probably won't live very long.|`|4TcgAVgEaa	Yes yes yes.<br>  <br>  Fish keeping is about water quality. Imagine swimming in urine and feces- not to mention 30 other people's urine and feces.<br>  <br>  The water may look clear, and everyone may SEEM healthy, but I garantee that you are shortening the life span of your fish significantly. Not only will they be extremely prone to illness, but over crowding causes stress and aggression.<br>  <br>  You need to do research. Here is a great book that explains how to stock beautiful and compatable communities, not to mention other important basics:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Simple-Guide-Fresh-Water-Aquariums/dp/0793821010/ref=pd_bbs_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235702615&sr=8-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Simple-Guide-Fresh...</a>|`|h2ShPEVXaa	A bigger tank I'm sure wont make eels less hungry, haha.

AA11114358	Its very important to know exactly what you need to do before getting a leopard gecko so good job so far!<br>  People usually feed leopard geckos mealworms,crickets, and roaches. I find that mealworms are the easiest because they aren't very fast so they can be easily caught, and they basically stay in your refridgerator until you want to feed them. When they are out, you can feed the mealworms slices of carrots and I usually put in a wad of wet paper towel in the container as well for water. You should feed them live insects definitely, as the dried ones have hardely ANY nutritional value and many, including my leopard gecko, will not eat anything that doesn't move. As for how much to feed them, younger geckos need to be fed more often, so I would always leave a few mealworms in a small dish that they can't escape out of so they can eat when they get hungry. Once they have reached maturity, I would feed him/her 4 times a week. Make sure that the mealworms are dusted with calcium powder every day when babies and twice a week as adults. Make sure that you purchase both calcium powder with AND without D3. Too much D3 is bad for your gecko. It sounds confusing at first, but its really easy once you get the hang of it.<br>  <br>  Some other tips you will need to know.<br>  <br>  - Leos should never be offered any fruits and vegetables. They are strickly carnivores.<br>  - No matter what the petstore people tell you, DO NOT use any loose substrates, especially Calcium sand and walnut shells. The calcium sand clumps together in the stomach as with any other sand, but calcium sand is especially bad because leopard geckos will actually purposely lick the sand to get their calcium needs. The walnut shells, when ingested will clog up the intestines and many times, rip their insides causing impaction and death. For this reason, I would recommend either tile, shelf liner, or reptile carpet. Tile is easy to maintain and reptile carpet looks neat and is washable.<br>  -Fill a bottle cap with phosphorous/D3 FREE calcium powder so it is available whenever your leo needs calcium<br>  -You can use a heating pad that goes under the tank, and/or red/black light bulbs for heating. I personally use a black light during the day and a UTH (under tank heater) for the night. They can't see the black/red lights so this way it will not disrupt their sleeping patterns and it doesnt hurt their eyes. You should keep the hot side of the cage around 85-90 degrees F and the cool side around 75-80 degrees. DO NOT.....DO NOT use heat rocks as this will literally cook your gecko and can cause severe burns.<br>  -Do not put your leos cage by a window. The temps will get too hot and they dont like the light.<br>  - Make sure they always have a humid hide, a hiding place for the cool side, a hiding spot on the warm side, a dish of calcium powder, and water in their cage at all times. The humid hide can be any container (mine is an old yougurt container) with a hole to enter in and a substrate that will hold humidity (wet paper towel, wet bed-a-beast) to aid in shedding. Many leos have a hard time getting all of their shed off of their toes, so this is necessary so the skin doesnt build up on their toes causing the toes to actually loose blood flow and die from the built up skin.<br>  -Do not house leopard geckos together. They are solitary animals. Males will fight with each other, a male and female will breed....and breed....and breed leading to the female loosing nutrition, and you having to raise hundreds of babies. Two females could be kept together, but they will, many times, have a dominate female that will keep the other from feeding well and having access to a hide.<br>  -The neck of a leo should be atleast the same size, if not bigger, than the size of the base of the tail. When picking out a gecko in a store, keep in mind that they will probably be underweight so try to find the one that has the fattest tail as this will probably be the healthiest.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry for all of my rambling, but you would be suprised at the mistakes people end up making when they don't research before buying. Repticzone.com is an AMAZING website filled with caresheets and forums you can ask questions on.<br>  Good Luck!|`|TIPibQR9aa	I have a female leopard gecko and i buy live crickets and keep them in their own container. She is two years old and eats 7 every other day. You have to feed the crickets as well. Petco carries it just ask them.<br>  <br>  They also need a calcium substrate (powder also at petco) just put crickets or mealworms in a bag with a dash of the powder and shake it up and plop the food in the lizards tank.<br>  <br>  So all you need is <br>  <br>  crickets<br>  cricket food<br>  cricket container<br>  mealworms<br>  calcium powder<br>  and plenty of water for your lizard<br>  <br>  My lizard refuses to eat anything that is already dead so your might be the same way.

Definatly keep the cat in your room when dad is home. (you'll find your cat will bond faster with you this way) I would also have a serious chat with your dad/mom & express how this is making you feel.

TSc8OE4vaa	She could jump, but probably not very high.  Arabians are known to be very bad jumpers.  The kind of do an awkward "bunny hop" over the jump because their conformation is not suited to jumping.  I've seen a few that have done well but more often their jumping style is unsightly at best and dangerous at worst.  <br>  <br>  If you are looking to buy a horse, get a thoroughbred or warmblood to do jumping with, they are the best jumpers.  Quarter horses can jump but they are not well known for it, they are typically a bit too stocky to do much.  Appaloosas and paints are in the same category as QH's.  Morgans can make nice jumpers, but they are often not trained to jump.<br>  <br>  EDIT- the below poster cites her age as a problem, but it is most definitely not.  She's only ten!  She has at least ten more years of use in her, and because Arabs are usually pretty sturdy she probably has even more than that.  <br>  <br>  Also I would not discount her because of her temperament.  Yes, Arabians are often "hot" and are seen as flighty and spooky, but from the owner's description I don't think she's like that.  Some can be bombproof trail horses.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I still think this horse is better suited to the trails than to jumping.|`|4AfRTzRmaa	she looks good just build up those muscles!! remember teddy o'conner,  a Thoroughbred/Shetland/Arabian cross!! who would have though against all those warmbloods!! it just depends on how you teach her and how much she loves jumping. any horse can be taught (if they are in the right condition) they just need to want to do it, to win. And as you progress or make it exciting, they like it more. Remember give LOTS of praise when teaching!<br>  <br>  good luck|`|8Rn2pX4jaa	I have a little grey arab that look a lot like your little grey arab.  I don't jump him, but his previous owner used him in pony club and they would jump.  He wasn't grand prix material, but he was able to jump sufficiently for what she wanted to do. (2'6" I think)  However, he is a dynamite dressage horse!<br>  <br>  What kind of jumping do you want to do?  Competitive, pony club, cross country, etc.  This question is probably better suited for your trainer.<br>  <br>  She looks like a nice mare that would give you a lot of enjoyment and fun on trails and pleasure riding as well.  Go with your heart.  She will be your friend and pal for a long time.|`|AA11498082	You don't have to "teach her" she already knows.  All you do have to do is ASK her to jump.<br>  <br>  My little grey Aye-rab had never seen a jump before I asked him to go over one during a show.  We took 2nd in the class.  Arabs can do just about anything if you ask them correctly.|`|zYVCJRMXaa	U can always try. Thing is though is she wants to, some horses//ponies just have no interest, like some humans have no interest in art, music or mechanics, it all depends, if she shows a liking for it then go ahead and train away, remember start small to start.|`|WTWJh3Dkaa	you can teach a horse to jump but you cant make him. unless you're Chuck Norris. then you can make anyone do anything.|`|waoh4KUZaa	I wouldn't count on it. I mean, its possible, yes. But she's already quite old and as they say, you can't teach an old dog to play new tricks. Besides, Arabians are especially difficult, due to their spooky nature. I tried to train the sweetest little arab mare to jump when she was like seven and I got myself hurt multiple times in the attempt. :p<br>  <br>  if you want something cheap that you can train, i'd suggest getting something a little younger.

LAXxaxAZaa	Sounds like back pain to me. I'd switch saddles or ride bareback and see if he stops. If he does, it's your saddle. If he doesn't, I'd call your vet or a chiropractor.|`|RZPLec5Eaa	Call a chiropractor. His back is probably out|`|ejj2N3uaaa	Your first step should be to check his back and hindquarters (or just go ahead and do his whole body) for pain. Have someone who knows how to do it go over him and make sure he's okay. Next, check his tack and make sure everything is fitting him. Make sure nothing on the saddle has broken and made it fit oddly, and there's nothing stuck under the pad. If he's gained/lost weight or muscle, the saddle could fit differently.<br>  <br>  If everything checks out okay, consider it a behavior/attitude issue. Work him at the walk and jog until he is performing the way you want--listening, moving off your leg, responding to you, etc. Next, ask for the lope. If he bucks, push him forward--even if you have to kick him and pull his head up hard to do it. Don't worry about looking pretty or being nice. If he's going to be a jerk, you can too. Slowing him down or bringing him down to a halt/walk and starting over gives him a break, so he's learned that if he needs a break he just has to buck. My gelding can be the same way. I find it easier to often get into 2 point--and yes, this is a WP horse--and ask him for a fast lope if he's going to be a jerk. The increased speed basically tires him out faster. It also makes him want to slow down (my desired result) and allows him to stretch his legs and back. By getting off of his back, I'm not getting bounced so much if he bucks. The key to doing this is to have a low heel and solid leg; otherwise, you'll get bucked off trying to do it. But if you can get out of the seat, you won't feel the bucks as much. <br>  <br>  Push him forward--no matter what you have to do to accomplish that--and keep going. When he lopes for a decent amount of time (start small and gradually ask for more) without bucking, slow him to a walk and praise him. If he bucks during that time, keep going--kick him and push forward. Do not let him stop until he does it without bucking; once he does, immediately stop. After he's had a break, do it again. It'll get easier and he'll respond faster until he's decided bucking isn't worth the effort anymore.|`|F8qAgR3Vaa	I had the same problem with my QH gelding. He needed the chiropractor because his ribs kept going out on him but once we fixed him up he kept bucking just because he learned a new trick to get me off (grr). So if he does not have anything wrong with his back you will just have to ride him through it. When you feel he is about to buck turn his head right to your knee because because unless he does some crazy bronco buck he can not buck. If he does manage to buck cause you did not catch him in time sit really deep in your seat with your legs forward (but not too far in the stirrups). You might feel like you should sit forward to hold on but that way you are almost guaranteed to get bucked off. I had the canter problem first with my QH but then he got so bad that if I just touched him with my legs at all he would throw a whole bucking bronc show on me. But I would get him checked out by the chiropractor first to see if there is anything wrong.|`|NevKx5fzaa	I used to have the same problem with my horse. The trick is sit tall ( u can tell i ride english by my lingo haha) and sit back in ur seat. yank his head up and be stern and dont fall down when he puts his head down. The biggest thing is to breath. I am sorry i am not much help... all i can give u is ride him TOUGH!! also if u ask him to lope and he's naughty and you are going to get off then jog him a few more laps so he knows that if he bucks he DOESN"T get to go back to the stable. I hope i helped. remember it's not worth u getting hurt.|`|zYVCJRMXaa	if it in a sudden habit, first thing to check is the saddle and his back, bucking is based alot on uncomfortable especially if it is a sudden change in behavior, and they are usually on a regular basis okay about it.|`|BI1GbIZUaa	As soon as you feel him start to lean forward to buck then pull him up and sit up tall. If this doesn't work then turn him in a circle so he can't buck. If this has just started then look at if your riding has changed. Even if you think it hasn't see if he does it with someone different riding him. Also check to see if your horse is in pain. My horse never bucked and he did a few times with me. I thought it was odd but just ignored it. Two weeks later i had to have the vet come out and she said that he had pain in his hock and stifle. He wasn't lame when i was riding but he was bucking because he wasn't comfortable. If he's not in pain and your riding hasn't changed see if a trainer can help you.|`|xGPRaEOWaa	maybe try getting some twine (hay string) and attaching it to his bit and to the saddle, it will prevent him from putting his head down which will make it hard for him to buck. when he bucks yell really loud and dont be scared of him after he does it, because he will know that is how he can win. be willing to ask for the lope again and just keep trying.|`|hFMV8LrOaa	i had the same problem, theres 2 things i tried, 1-everytime he does it ask for a dead gallop and make him do a couple laps til hes tired, couple times of that hel learn, or another way that really worked for me is i tied a lead rope to the horn (western) and every time he does it or starts to, reach down and slap him one on his rump, but for me that took some confidence cause  i hated hitting him but what works, works right? good luck!|`|ikBEORfqaa	stinks of a saddle fit or other pain issue. especially if he started doing it out of the blue. get that sorted out first. vet or chiropractor - best bet is a vet that's also a chiropractor. if he's in pain and you ask him to do what some of these ppl suggest, like dead gallops, you'll turn this into an even bigger problem. eliminate saddle & pain issues first so there's no doubt before treating it as behavioral. then dead gallop him all you want, if that's your thing.|`|ydKW7AHeaa	I would first see if he has any back issues or if anything is pinching him or rubbing him that would make him uncomfortable. When he does this pull his head up to keep him from bucking and keep him moving from a lot of leg and just bump him and yell at him so he knows hes not aloud to do that when he bucks.|`|gdH0Xmfjaa	I was going to ask if HE was a mare, haha but apparently not. When he bucks just make sure your sitting up and don't let his head go down, that way he physically CAN'T buck. Have you changed anything in his daily routine to make him behave like this?<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|JZ4vL90naa	well it depends if you've taken it to a trainer. If you haven't i suggest you should so they can teach you and your horse to deal with that|`|L4uwRphSaa	haha well your not alone, my friend had the same problem (we are 14 and have both had our horses for 1 year) , it got so bad that i let her ride my horse! i can just imagine how embarrassing it was for her to ask, we both have good bonds with our horses so it wasn't that, and because her horse just started doing it,i didn't figure it was a behavior or training problem, so i checked her tack, and found that she changed her pad because it was so worn, and her new pad wad causing the saddle to pinch her horse, and not give her good leg use! so i gave suggested this tacky too pad that my horse has. so i turns out it was her horses tack! but if your horse is or had this habbit slowly form, and get worse, then i suggest having someone look over tack, and if its good, have an experienced  ( like an old or person who trains etc. ) ride your horse, some horses just know who they can take advantage of, my horse thought he could make me struggle to mount, by moving, but i got the problem fixed by having someone show ME how to fix my horse. if it is a TRAINING or BAD HABBIT PROBLEM, get someone to show YOU how to fix the problem with YOUR HORSE! the more you know, the better the bond will be and he will know," can't mess with my master, she loves me, but she knows more, and i need to trust her." otherwise he will just say,"well i can be rude, get trained, then be rude when i go back to her!" -the cunning horse thinks of such plans haha!<br>  <br>  or maybe, your horse is like w.e and will just say,"well i dont want to got back to training, so i better just stick with what i learned!" <br>  <br>  -hope i helped!<br>  <br>  p.s- IF YOU ARE RIDING AND YOU FEEL HIM ABOUT TO BUCK, DON'T DO ANY HITTING, JUST TURN HIS HEAD IN ANY DIRECTION, SO HE CANT BUCK! THEN CORRECT THE PROBLEM! LUNGING HIM IN A LOPE WILL ALSO HELP YOU SEE IF ITS TACK OR JUST HIM!
qqUvoC5uaa	Huskies are very independent dogs typically. So they usually don't have the loyal "friendly" air about them as labs would have. Although when they want affection, you'll know it. <br>  A great breed though overall. If you have the time to spend training and *exercising*<br>  <br>  Border Collies are a herding breed of dog. They also require several good long walks daily. My border collie is not typically happy if he does not get out for at least 2 walks. (And we do have a big backyard where he runs our other dog for hours). Border Collies also tend to be a bit more standoffish like huskies. Maybe not to the same extent. But again, they will come to you when they want affection. <br>  <br>  Granted there are acceptions to each breed individually, and it depends on how the pups were raised as well. <br>  <br>  Huskies are frequently bred with border collies in the dog sledding world because they are both tireless workers, only border collies typically have a higher willingness to learn.|`|KFaPuayuaa	i would do some Research on both types of bread, siberian huskies are great a lot of people just don't know about them and they end up in a shelter, homeless or hit by a car.

I will warn you of two things though: Huskies are a Northern breed. Northern breeds need to be on a leash or inside a fence at all times as they like to roam given the chance. The other thing: Collies have a genetic defect where they are badly allergic to ivermectin which according to the website I looked at, referenced below, is a pesticide drug (I think it is sometimes in flea shampoo?), and in general collies have sensitive skin.|`|kQyER3blaa	Siberian huskies are very friendly.

Please do not buy on a whim & the cheapest may not always be in the best condition.<br>  You should check with reputable breeders & always see the mother with the puppies. If you are dismissed from this factor, step back.<br>  Good places to look for animals are shelters which re-home such as the RSPCA, Dogs Trust, Blue Cross, Wood Green Animal Shelters etc. You can go through the adoption process in any one of these & they will carefully match the puppy or dog to the owner. I do not mean to sound patronising, but there are so many animals given up for adoption each year, so please consider giving them a second chance first. Hope this is of some help.|`|9203e742d7f8e1326e119aa1ca8803e2aa	The best place to look is probably in your local veterinary surgeries as puppies are often advertised there. Another good place is pet shops.<br>  <br>  I've worked in rescue kennels and the dogs you get in there are wonderful but if you've got young kids please remember: 90% of the dogs that are there are there for a reason. That reason could be as simple as the last owner didn't know the first thing about dogs and just taught it bad behaviour and wasn't prepared to sort it. Those dogs make great pets but not with young kids around.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for a lab make sure that the parents have hip (and where possible knee) scores since this breed suffers from joint problems even from an early age.

uBFhKXgHaa	Iams is a crappy quality dog food.<br>  <br>  Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your dog? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot. <br>  <br>  Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, there are some excellent dog foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.<br>  <br>  Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Pedigree, Kibbles n' Bits, Beneful, Ol'Roy.<br>  <br>  Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Canidae All Life Stages, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timberwolf Organics.<br>  <br>  Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material and higher quality ingredients means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!<br>  <br>  Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul and Canidae All Life Stages.<br>  <br>  Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by... you guessed it, the crappy pet food companies! They also often get kickbacks from the companies for pushing these products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)<br>  <br>  A great option is to go with an entirely grain-free diet. Many of the high quality foods now put out grain-free formulas. Some good grain-free diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Canidae Grain Free All Life Stages, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, GO Natural Grain Free, Sold Gold Barking At The Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.<br>  <br>  Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo. <br>  <br>  If you can't find a food, most of the high quality dog food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the dog food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.<br>  <br>  Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: <a href="http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/</a><br>  <br>  Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:<br>  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food<br>  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food<br>  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food<br>  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food<br>  <br>  Another option for feeding dogs is to feed raw.

Spaying before the first heat cycle is highly recommended and healthiest in females as it reduces the chances of mammary gland cancer later in life to near zero, but even spaying afterwards has a lot of health benefits. Spaying eliminates the chances of uterine and ovarian cancer as well as eliminating the chances of pyometra (a deadly uterine infection). Every heat cycle a female goes through increases her chances of developing mammary, ovarian, or uterine cancer later in life as well as putting her at risk for developing pyometra.

9825a4accf342d98abca06fdb35d659aaa	Bloodhounds were bred as tracking dogs. They have an amazing ability to track scent even days after someone has passed by. They are often used to track missing people. As a breed they tend to be very gentle dogs but they can be stubborn and difficult to train. The breed is prone to developing gastrointestinal bloat and it is a leading cause of death in the breed, so if you own one you should learn the symptoms in case your dog needs help. This is an emergency condition that you cannot 'wait and see'.|`|ll6e1VEzaa	It's a bloodhound. Here is some info about bloodhounds:<br>  <br>  A bloodhound (also known as the St. Hubert hound) is a large breed of dog bred for the specific purpose of tracking human beings. Consequently, it is often used by authorities to track escaped prisoners or missing persons. It is a scenthound, famed for its ability to follow a scent hours or even days old, over long distances. Combining a keen sense of smell with a tenaciously strong tracking instinct, bloodhounds have proven their worth as the archetypal trailing dog.<br>  <br>  Appearance<br>  Bloodhounds weigh from 33 to 50 kg (80 to 110 lb, although some individuals can weigh as much as 160lbs) and stand 58 to 69 cm (23 to 27 inches) high at the withers. According to the AKC's standard of the bloodhound breed, larger dogs are to be preferred by AKC conformation judges. The acceptable colors for bloodhounds are black and tan, liver and tan, or red. In the Middle Ages, they also occurred in other solid colors, including white (known as the Talbot hound). The colors appear in other breeds descended from the early bloodhounds, however. Bloodhounds possess an unusually large skeletal structure; most of their weight is concentrated in their bones, which are very thick for their length. The coat is typical for a scenthound: hard, and composed of fur alone, with no admixture of hair.<br>  <br>  Temperament<br>  This breed is a gentle dog who is nonetheless tireless in following a scent. Because of its strong tracking instinct, it can be willful and somewhat difficult to obedience train. However, with the proper amount of time, effort, and how well one treats it, this can be achieved easily.<br>  <br>  Affectionate, gentle, and even-tempered describes a bloodhound and they make excellent family pets but, like any large breed, require supervision when around small children because they will knock them over with their bulk. Bloodhounds are also characterized by a stubborn "whats-in-it-for-me?" temperament, a likely cause (in conjunction with their size and propensity for excessive drooling) for the high rate of bloodhounds given up for adoption once full-grown in comparison with other breeds.<br>  <br>  Morbidity (Illness)<br>  Compared to other purebred dogs, bloodhounds have an unusually high rate of gastrointestinal ailments, with gastric dilatation volvulus (GDV, or "bloat") being the most common type of gastrointestinal problem. They also have an unusually high incidence of eye, skin, and ear ailments. Eyes, ears, and skin should be inspected frequently for signs of developing problems. Owners should be especially aware of the signs of GDV, which is both the most common illness and the leading cause of death of bloodhounds. They also have the tendency to get overheated quickly.<br>  <br>  Mortality (Longevity and Causes of Death)<br>  Bloodhounds in a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey had a median longevity of 6.75 years, which makes them one of the shortest-lived of dog breeds. The oldest of the 82 deceased dogs in the UK survey died at 12.1 years. The leading cause of death was gastric dilatation volvulus (GDV = "bloat" or "torsion"), which killed 34% of dogs. This percentage of dogs dying of bloat is among the highest of all dog breeds and far higher than for dogs in general. The second leading cause of death in bloodhounds was cancer, at 27%. The percentage of cancer deaths is similar to other breeds but, in bloodhounds, cancer kills at an unusually young age (median of about 8 years).<br>  <br>  Gastric dilatation volvulus<br>  Bloodhound owners should take special note of the extremely high incidence of GDV (Gastric dilatation volvulus) in this breed. Excess gas trapped in the dog's stomach causes "bloat." Twisting of the stomach (volvulus or "torsion") causes, or is caused by, excess gas. Symptoms include restlessness, inability to get comfortable, pacing, or retching without being able to bring up anything. The dog's abdomen may be visibly swollen but dogs can bloat or torsion without visible swelling. GDV is a dire emergency condition. If you suspect a dog is bloating, you should not wait to see if he improves. A dog with GDV requires immediate veterinary care. The dog's survival usually depends on whether the owner can get him to the vet in time. It is a good idea for a bloodhound owner to know the route to the nearest 24 hour emergency clinic in advance, so time is not wasted looking for directions.<br>  <br>  History<br>  The bloodhound was, according to legend, first bred ca. 1000 AD by monks at the St. Hubert Monastery in Belgium. Undoubtedly, its origins do reside in France, home of many of the modern hound breeds. Its excellent tracking skills were drawn on in breeding other scenthounds, such as the English Foxhound, American Foxhound, Coonhound, Swiss Jura Hound, Bavarian Mountain Hound, and many others.<br>  History<br>  During the late 19th century, bloodhounds were frequent subjects for artists such as Edwin Landseer and Briton Riviere. The dogs depicted are close in appearance to modern bloodhounds, indicating that the essen|`|DK6kYxmGaa	Bloodhound|`|j2CbOyEuaa	A  blood-hound.

zpwJR60baa	Hi, I am a cat behavior, which is why cat confinement is important.  Now that you have the other cat on the room... hang in there, it will take a while from 72 hours to 1 week.  You are already spending equal time with them.  Crack the room open a little bit, and let the natures happen.  They will start to smell, hiss and soon play with each other.  What you can also do, is put the residence cat in a room, so the new kitten to leave his scent around the house.  Later-wards, you can get a string toys, to get play interaction ready... once they start playing they will growl first, but soon play with one another.|`|vJRMmgd6aa	i got my cats a month apart from each (both kittens when i got them) at first the older one hated the new one for like 2 weeks, but eventually they were fine!  ive had them for 2 years now and they are always together!  just give them some time!|`|czPzAuSAaa	You're just going to have to give them time.

They're so cute, and if you play with both of them and don't give one more attention than the other, they should be fine...<br>  <br>  PS: GET THEM FIXED!!!|`|TdRgGCJPaa	Play with them together yea your happy your family is happy as well!!!!|`|6qh6sRX9aa	When I first got my two kittens about a year ago they hated each other... But I put them, and myself (to play referee..) in the same room with no furniture, just the three of us, a litter box and water bowl, and about a dozen toys on the floor.<br>  <br>  They hissed and spat at each other and wrestled a bit but as soon as the female asserted her dominance over the male, all was well. They didn't hurt each other as I'd trimmed their claws (I don't believe in de-clawing a cat) before doing this and cats tend to fight with their feet instead of with their teeth. <br>  <br>  It took about 2 hours for them to settle down. Now, they're inseparable. Best friends.<br>  <br>  Also, get your cats fixed. If they're both females and both still intact, they will fight for territorial reasons. That's why I got a boy and a girl. Less conflict. This is also healthy because whole females are extremely annoying when in heat... they call for males and get really moody. They're happier when spayed and you won't have stray males wandering about trying to find a way into your house.|`|EdB0ghKwaa	Cats are naturally solitary creatures, and it takes time for them to adjust to having another cat around.  I have found it normally takes around two weeks for things to settle down, but unless they are from the same litter, don't expect them to become friends!  As others have said, they need to get the pecking order straight, so just give them some time:-)  Your older cat sees the new one as a threat, and she/he needs to discover that this is not the case.  Growling is to be expected when you bring a new cat into the house!<br>  <br>  Also, try to transfer their scents to each other; cats are very sensitive to smells.  Stroke one, and then the other, to transfer the scent.  Things will soon calm down.

QMRq8Cneaa	First off u should know that horses are ALOT of responsibility. Once a month, you have to get someone to come out to your house and clip you horses Hoofs. That is about $30. You need to brush your horse every day, and pet it with lots of love. The main problem with horses is trust. You need to trust them, and they need to trust you. Start with petting and calmly speaking to your horse an hour a day, and everyday as well. Before you buy your horse, ride it first to see if it responds to your commands. Things you need to buy:<br>  1. Hard bristle brush<br>  2. Saddle<br>  3. Balnket<br>  4. Bridle<br>  5. Horse treats<br>  6. lead rope<br>  7.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  Yes the presence of the nictitating membrane when cats are awake and alert is a sign of illness/poor health. It can occur with many diseases and/or ocular pain due to injury or infection, and is a red flag to an owner to make an appointment with the vet for proper diagnosis and treatment.<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent resource article about the topic which has all the information that you need.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <a href="http://www.vin.com/VINDBPub/SearchPB/Proceedings/PR05000/PR00523.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.vin.com/VINDBPub/SearchPB/Pro...</a><br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  years of experience with a cat that has ocular herpes.
YCvgjLdnaa	well first off congratulations :)<br>  giving birth to stillborns is unlikely and not something that happens very often. if it happens there is unfortunatly noting you can do.<br>  you are probably not going to be there during the birth as they hide, like to be alone, and you are at school it is unlikely to happen between 3:00 and 10:00 or even on the expected date, its a guess and many come early or late.<br>  cats give birth on their own the majority of the time and it is completely fine, in fact most cats prefer it. i would suggest not to cut the placeta as the mother cat should eat it as she would in the wild. i would say, if you are going to be with the cat at birth, (which is good in some ways but you may stress the cat out. try not to let her notice you if you are there at the birth, but try to be there is anything goes wrong) that you do not stroke or fuss the cat, do not get in the way, and do not touch the kittens until she has eaten the placenta, cleaned them and has accepted them. i would sugest not touching them for a couple of hours incase of rejection. and the mother will want to feed them. Its such an awesome experience, good luck|`|BVtnCy1vaa	She's young. It's not very likely. As long as the pregnancy hasn't been too traumatic, she'll be fine. Don't worry about the birthing process, every animal except for humans manages to give birth fine by themselves.
hoOygDw1aa	A rabbit's gestation period is generally 28-35 days, with 31 being average. I have some does who will pull fur and make a nest DAYS before they're due and others who will do it right before or after they give birth. So it will depend largely on your individual rabbit!<br>  <br>  A normal litter size for Hollands is about 2-4 babies. I have one doe who will consistently give me 5-6, and have heard of some having litters of 8+ (though that is uncommon). A larger brood doe will generally have more than a smaller show doe.<br>  <br>  As for colors, it varies depending on what the rabbits carry. If they're pedigreed, you could look at the rabbits in their pedigree and more easily determine color possibilities. From an orange x black breeding, you will most likely get chestnuts and blacks.<br>  <br>  Good luck! Baby bunnies are fun to have around!|`|oGVWdnHraa	Being cross breed, it is difficult to predict what colours they will be. Over the next  couple of days she should start to pull fur out.
tY14vbrKaa	A dog peeing in the house is not housebroken.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you should try taking him outside?|`|0R0uRNuIaa	He is just asserting his dominace. He needs to know that he is not the pack leader|`|KxjUim7yaa	My dog is housebroken and he DOESN'T pee in my kitchen. Your dog needs to be potty trained and neutering might help.|`|xwSNEYICaa	It is a territorial and/or dominance issue.   My 4-year-old poodle does the same thing.  He started when he was a littler over a year old, because we bought another poodle as a mate for him.  I have not found a way to break it, but I have found a way to control it.  <br>  <br>  My poodle knows he is not supposed to do it.  He will not do it while we are awake or around.  He only does it if he is left home or at night when everyone is sleeping.  All we have to say is "What is this?" and he slinks down so low, his belling scrapes the ground, and he goes and lays down.  To control that, I have made him a "doggie belt".  <br>  <br>  To do this, you will need:<br>  1 yard of cotton material (I used what I had, he has "Darth Vader" doggie belts)<br>  Velcro<br>  Sewing Machine or No-Sew Tape<br>  No-Fray liquid (all of the above is available at Wal-Mart)<br>  My dog is a Miniature Poodle, so I cut the material in a rectangle, about 4 inches wide (you will need it bigger for a bigger dog, make sure it is enough to cover from the back legs to the mid-ribcage area) and big enough that it overlaps about 3-4 inches over itself.  Wrap it around your dog's waist to measure (make sure it is a little loose, but not loose enough to fall off).  Cut piece to size, then sew or use no-sew bonding tape to attach a strip of velcro to each side, so it closes on top of the dog. Use No-Fray around the edges of the material to keep it from fraying. It should look like a rectangle, with the velcro on the short sides of the rectangle.  Now, you have a machine-washable "doggie belt".   You should be able to make several out of a yard of material, depending on the size of your dog.  <br>  <br>   I should note, this only works with male dogs.  I also add a heavy-duty maxi pad (cheap, generic ones that are <$2 pack/28), so I don't have to wash the belts every night.  It's not a cure, but it helps control it.  I also wash off his area with anti-bacterial soap every morning, to keep any infections away.  I've been using this for 2 years, and it has really cut down clean-up.<br>  <br>  I have tried everything, except neutering (he is a rarer- red poodle), and despite being walked 30 mins everyday (like the Dog Whisperer suggests) and being submissive, he still pees on things when not being monitored.  There may be nothing you can do to stop it, but I hope this can help you control it.|`|DtHpxL1qaa	he is either mad or feels lonely that's what happened to my dog whenever he is alone. also the possibility is that there was a change in the house and he/she is not used to it|`|TJGje2blaa	Get him neutered so he will be submissive & look to you as the leader.|`|pSX5stBHaa	1st - Is your dog neutered?<br>  If yes, how long ago?  Dogs usually mature around the age of 3 years and start to mark anywhere from 6 months to 1 year.<br>  If no, you need to get your dog neutered. (This may or may not fix the issue.)<br>  There could be several reasons for this, all fall under the behavioral category.<br>  Most likely he could be marking.  Do you have another dog?  Do you live in a rental that had other dogs?<br>  Is he peeing on a specific item, corner, etc...?<br>  Are you able to block the item?  <br>  Are you able to block him from the kitchen?<br>  Is your dog obedience trained and exercised?<br>  You would be surprised what exercise and training will do for a dog.<br>  Tell your vet what is going on and see what he/she has to say on the subject.<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  For your daily doggy news visit www.goldenrottie.blogspot.com|`|AlZxgtXraa	there's many reasons why a dog would do that. Some do it because they are upset or jealous. They don't feel like they are getting enough attention.

I would call a trainer to curb this bad habit.
m16gf9mzaa	You know, the behavior you describe really sounds like ordinary kitten behavior.  Kittens have three settings:  eat, sleep, and 90mph. Whenever I have a kitten around, I joke about needing to invent a non-toxic EndDust, so I can spray it on the kitten.  That way the kitten can dust all the out of the way spots it gets into as it runs around the house.  The one thing you can give your kitten to help her calm down, is time.  And of course, start discussing when to get her fixed with your veterinarian now, so that you can avoid the particularly crazy behaviors of going into heat.  <br>  <br>  To help keep kitty occupied in a safe and healthy way, here are some ideas that might alleviate any boredom or loneliness she feels while y'all are away at work.  Yeah I know, she's already got a million toys, right? Try putting away all but a few, and then rotating them every few days so they seem fresh and new.  And don't forget to give some things to hide in and climb on, like a nice climb-able cat tree (I recommend the kind wrapped in sisal rope over the carpeted style), a paper grocery bag, or a cardboard box. If money is short, you can make a tree yourself - my boyfriend made one out of scrap lumber, 6in diameter pvc pipe, and some sisal rope; I'm not that handy, but I have made some kitty fun houses by gluing strong cardboard boxes together and cutting holes in between them so the cats could climb around, attached some burlap to one side for something to scratch at, and put a few toys inside. Give a couple of different bags or boxes at a time, so s/he can dart from one to the other.  There are toys that are made to dangle from door knobs or from the top of the door.  Catnip pads are great, too - or will be when she is older. For some reason, kittens do not respond to catnip.   Try one of those toys that drop treats as the cat plays with them.  Consider changing how you feed kitty - instead of food always at one location, what about putting several small portions in different locations, for her to explore, hunt and find.    Don't forget the value of birdwatching - if possible, put birdfeeders outside of your cat's favorite sitting-windows - instant CatTV.  And don't worry too much if squirrels get to the birdseed - squirrels are fun to watch, too.|`|ZrB5xJUSaa	My anty Shanon has a kitten named Missi and she always love a little milk but not too much and then she will slowly drift to sleep.<br>  <br>   hope I helped|`|YVjmzAtQaa	cats are always have lots of energy after catnip. Try feeding it, cats always get tired after they have there meal. Maybe pet the kitten and it might calm down.|`|DvMS9Jjuaa	Get her toys, catnip, set a mirror on the floor so she thinks there's another cat in the room, there should be some type of food to calm her down.
evWSROsXaa	I have a boston terrier and he is the most independent little guy you will ever meet. <br>  Dog are a lot more dependent of you than any other pet. ( They don't have any where to potty but outside) And sometimes, that can become a hassle. For example, my boston terrier as soon as he sees grass, squats and does his business and he's done. My puggle mix on the other hand prefers to go on an actual walk before she does her business which is a hassle in the rain and snow. So you need a lot of patience. I suggest adopting an older dog and researching and asking a lot of questions to the "foster parents" because having a puppy is beyond a handle, esp. for one person in an apartment building where you can't just open the back door and let them run free. <br>  Once you start looking, you can find older "adult" or "senior" dogs that ended up in shelters because their owners passed or had to move into an apt. that doesn't allow dogs. Those dogs, are usually well behaved, trained and just looking for a family again. But, if you don't research and talk with the foster mom and just jump in and get a dog, you could get someone that was given up for bad habits or that lived in a puppy mill all their lives and have no etiquette or house manners.<br>  Take a look at this website<br>  www.petfinder.com<br>  on the upper left hand corner is the search. you can search boston terriers in your zip code and read about the dog and its past. <br>  hope this helps!<br>  =)|`|CJMhtM7maa	I am not trying to be mean,BUT, you should reconsider about getting a dog.A dog is like getting married,you have to spend time(a lot) with the spouse,same as a dog.It needs training,socializing,etc.You can't just get a dog,shove it in a apartment and expect it to be fine.Maybe a goldfish,you feed it daily,change the water,and your done with it.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Get a cat.|`|4SQx8smEaa	A dog is most likely not for you...when you own a dog you cannot just up and leave and do what you want...you have to find people to watch and take care of you dog for you when you go on vacation or leave for more then 12 hours. They are like having children...they realy on you fully for companionship..you are resonsbile for them, and they need to be trained...i think a cat would be a better fit for you.<br>  <br>  good idea to evaluate costs, of both financial and your time. To be a responsible owner of a pet, you really need to decide if you are prepared to meet these costs. Even if you’re offered a free puppy, dogs are not free. When you own a dog responsibly, you agree to take on a variety of costs.<br>  <br>  First off, you have basic care and feeding if you own a dog. There is inexpensive dog food, but some dogs may require special diets, and overall, most dogs fare better on pricier dog food with better ingredients. Expect to pay about $30-50 US Dollars (USD) aaa month for food for a medium sized dog.<br>  <br>  When you own a dog, you’ll need a few things immediately. These may include a dog crate, especially if the dog is untrained. These can cost about $50-150 USD, depending on the size of the animal. You’ll need a leash, food bowls, bedding, and fencing for any outdoor areas. Young dogs frequently need behavior training too. If you’re not experienced at training a dog, you may need to take classes. A class at a Parks and Recreation Center may charge about $50-150 USD, and if you use dog behavior classes at a dog trainer facility, this can cost about $1000 USD.<br>  <br>  Don’t forget the cost of puppy or young dog damage on your house and furniture. Until a dog is properly trained, they may urinate on your rugs, floors or furniture, and they may chew up items you need. If you have carpet, you may have to invest in several carpet cleanings $100-200 USD, before a dogis reliably trained. Most puppies aren’t considered fully reliable until they are about six months to aaa year old, and small dogs, because of small bladders may always be slightly unreliable.<br>  <br>  So initially, even if you don’t pay aaa cent to acquire a dog, you can expect to pay anywhere from $600 USD a year in food, about $100-200 USD for basic dog supplies, and anywhere from $50 to over $1000 USD for behavior training, plus about $200 USD in cleaning. Additionally, check with your local animal control department regarding the cost to license your dogdogdog. The first year’s costs could be about $950-$2000 USD for basic care alone.<br>  <br>  This is just the beginning if you own a dog. You must provide veterinary care when you own a dog. This includes vaccinations, dental checks, yearly examinations, and spaying or neutering. Don’t forget flea treatment medication (about $10-15 USD per month), plus heartworm medication, about $10 per month. Minimal vet care including aaa yearly teeth cleaning, exams, vaccination, flea treatment and heartworm meds will cost about $500-1000 USD. Moreover, any dog can be prone to accidents, injury, ingesting a dangerous substance, which means you may have to be prepared to pay for emergency care, which can easily exceed $1000 USD in aaa single visit.<br>  <br>  As dogs age many of them develop health conditions that require more frequent vet visits. Some get diabetes, some get cancer, and some develop heart or respiratory conditions. These conditions can dramatically increase average vet care bills.<br>  <br>  The cost of time in raising an animal is significant. While it may seem like a great idea to own a dog, consider what to do when you vacation or how much time you actually spend at home or with your dog. If you are hardly ever home and you can’t take your dog with you to workworkwork, then the cost to the dog may be too great. Dogs are by nature social creatures, and will be better behaved when they get greater interaction with you. If you haven’t got time to take Rover or Spot for a walk each day, groom them, play with them and treat them well, then maybe the cost to the dog is too significant. <br>  <br>  Over the lifetime of the dog, you can expect to pay about $1500-3000 USD per year for all care needs, and more as a dog ages and needs greater health care. You may also want to consider if you rent whether you will have a more difficult time finding a new home if you move, and what type of pet deposits you may need to pay in order to keep your animal.|`|0ZrRRGmiaa	If you think a dog will interfere with your life, now is maybe not the time. You can have a dog and still have your life but the dog also becomes a big part of you. If your looking for a pooch that doesn't mind your comings and goings I would look into an English bulldog. They are more pricey but sounds as though it would fit your lifestyle better. They have been labelled apartment dogs as they like to sleep alot and don't mind being left alone for periods of time. Bostons are busy dogs and need a very active lifestyle. I hope this helps a little at least...|`|i9RTZnqFaa	Having a dog is like having a special needs child who will never grow up. Dogs can't do much on their own, they're completely dependent on humans for their existence.

9825a4accf342d98abca06fdb35d659aaa	You might want to consider joining a dog training class so you can get tips from a professional. A lot of the big pet stores have them. Also, there are things you can do to help make sure she sees you as the "leader of the pack". It's good to eat in front of your dog and then feed her when you are finished. Dogs use food distribution as a way to determine who's at the top of the heap. Don't share food from your plate with her because to her that will mean you are equal and she doesn't need to obey. Also, when you pass through doorways try to have yourself go first and her follow--I don't know if that is difficult in a wheelchair. When I first got my dog I had to push my way in front of him but now he stands back and waits for me to go first. You might get some child gates and use them to block the doorways of rooms where she is causing problems. Make her learn that freedom to roam the house has to be earned. Some breeds are very stubborn and hard to train. If you aren't able to take her to a training class try reading up on training tips on the internet. It can take awhile and can get frustrating but if you stick with it you will eventually be rewarded with a well behaved dog.|`|cff06890d4173c156cdcc883215f12bcaa	First of all stop hitting her.  You are describing a dog who is confused and does not understand what you want.  Do not give human thoughts and emotions to dogs--their brains do not work that way.  If you want her off the furniture, then you must reinforce that EVERY time.  Do not leave her loose without supervision.  Keep her leash tied to your chair so you always know where she is until she learns what is expected of her.  Any dog will steal food if they can get to it...they are not being bad or spiteful, they simply are not trained.  You might need the help of a trainer to help you with some of these problems.  She sounds like a nice dog...just be patient and learn the proper techniques for training her.|`|Mlx5j4zFaa	If you can put the dog outside after you spank her.

5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -<br>  <br>  Take him by the jowl on the top pinch to the bottom and shut the mouth.  Say "no, no, no, no bite" repeat it 2x.  End with a tap on the nose...nothing is to be done in a loud voice...just keep it easy yet stern.  If you just keep it a teaching moment they will learn.  I am guessing the little one is teething so just like children they need something to chew on.  After the no bite process...had your pup the toy of preference to chew on.  Just state matter of factly "here's your toy" then play a bit to avert attention to the toy.  He will catch on if you stay consistent and cool headed.  If you teach him to sit you can just avert attention to a command then hand him the toy after the no bit command is used.  Here is how it is done.<br>  I do not use food to entice good behavior.  I have them on a leash without any lead what so ever.  I use a harness not a collar. (my preference-neck jerking is not good for a dog)<br>  I tug the leash say the word sit in a stern and serious manner.  I take one hand under the chin to keep his attention directed at me while the other hand pushes the rump in a sit position.  I continue doing this over and over and while in the sit position say “good sit...nice job” this is repeated several times.  Lift your hand off the rump...he will probably stand up immediately at first then do it all over again.  Spend about 10 min. doing this, take about a 30 min. brake and do it again...do this as often as you like.  If you have a 1/2 day, full day, just the one time.  Do it when you get home from work/school, do it before and after dinner, before bed....you get the picture.  After the sit command is learned then you can go on to leash training...or mix it up a little..your choice.  Do what works for you and your dog.|`|C9VXUKGpaa	Roll him. It won't hurt him if done correctly. It is natural dog discipline. It is just saying "that is not okay" Reward for any good behavior as always!

We tried a lot of things and each worked  temporarily.We tried getting a toy and shove it in his mouth and say loud and firm no bitting, Also if you make a big fuss and scream "ow  ow" and walk away or push them away they will get it that biting means no playing or love. My dog is a total protector and will stop dead in his tracks to check if i am okay if he thinks i am in pain. I have also tried holding the mouth close and if its really severe when they bit you GENTLY pinch the check/lip enough to make the dog uncomfortable.This worked immediately because it stopped being fun but  this is a last resort and should only be done to check the dog back into reality but if your dog is overly aggressive this may just trigger him to bite harder. GET HIS SHOTS  asap for everyone's safety. The main thing on whatever you try is to be consistent. My dog responded most to being scolded then ignored. He gets hyper from time to time but he knows biting is  huge no no. GOOD Luck|`|9825a4accf342d98abca06fdb35d659aaa	Is he a puppy? Puppy's bite a lot but you can train them to stop. When he bites at you grab his muzzle and hold his mouth closed. Say NO very loudly. (I think the same would work with an adult dog but I've never had to train an adult to not bite, so not sure.) Don't ever let him get away with biting because he's "just playing". If holding his mouth shut doesn't help walk out of the room. It's great if you put a puppy gate in the doorway and then stand where he can see you but can't get to you. He'll start to learn that certain behaviors drive you away. Also, you can buy some bitter apple spray and spray it on your clothes/yourself. Dogs don't like the taste and they will learn to associate that nasty taste with your hands and legs and not want to bite. With puppies it's mostly a matter of being consistent with the training. Biting and chewing are ways puppies explore--it's up to you to teach him what he is allowed to bite or chew. Good luck.|`|whdSi5bTaa	its natural for dogs to play bite, but as soon as he bites stop playing with him, u can shout ouch! quite loudly to startle him, tell him that he is a bad boy, and then completely ignore him for 5 mins and  start playing again, repeat this when ever necessary. he needs to know that biting is unacceptable.|`|1fKD04R3aa	Every time he tries to bite, shove one of his toys in his mouth and say "No Biting" "Get Your Toy" in a low, but loud voice.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi Kia,<br>  <br>  LOVE your question!!! I wish I had a dollar for every cat toy on the floor, or hidden under the sofa cushions. There are about 10 little chewed up mouse toys, a couple of crinke balls, but their favorite thing with which to play is rolled up paper balls. I hardly ever throw them away, so they add up to the assortment of  fun things with which to play.<br>  <br>  Now let's talk about the under the fridge or stove.. or the dry sink in my bedroom... when I do my Spring cleaning we find a cache of "forgotten" toys which have been stowed away for a "rainy day", but somehow never get out to play again. Oh.. and yes.. that great big carton which arrived the other day filled with a catfood and litter delivery.. one of their best hiding places. I think I should enter my house in a "cat friendly enviroment" contest. I would win paws down!!<br>  <br>  And one should not forget to mention a toy or two that gets dragged into the bed, only to be discovered when I roll onto it, as I imitate the "Princess and the Pea" fairy tale, or the toy that is dropped on my head early in the morning to get me out of bed. Does that one count?<br>  <br>  You are a great kitty mom who provides a luxurious assortment of fun things for your cats to use. You should be highly respected and adored by your four footed furry friends.

QB0CnrmJaa	At the beginning, chickens do something called a "pecking order" when they have a new addition to their coop. They peck at eachothers combs and tails until whoever surrenders. Then whoever wins, gets the most food, attention, etc. The ones at the lowest you will notice have no feathers on their back sometimes, but in a small group of chickens, this shouldn't happen very violently, but I will guarantee you, they will fight for their spot in the pecking order, it's just how they live.<br>  <br>  Soon, they will all get along after that, but if a chicken at the bottom of the pecking order is eating something the chicken at the highest pecking order will come over and eat that and chase the chicken away, but that is completely normal, they will still stand up for eachother.<br>  <br>  I suggest you don't get a rooster to watch over the hens. I hatch my chicks from eggs, and then the roosters pick on the hens and usually kill my hens. Unless you want dead chicken, I suggest no roosters...unless of course you do wants dead hens, and baby chicks.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your chickens! Great choices too! I loved the patterns and look of the barred rock, and the sweetness of the Americana's. As I said in your last post, I suggested those types! Good luck!!! =]|`|XiSe6fMbaa	yes
oDVx7nSxaa	Prozac (actually the generic) is now the drug of choice among vets who actually have studied animal behavior.  It's extremely effective in most cases, and dosed properly it does NOT drug the cat.  It can be given long term, or long enough to break the cycle of the behavior, then many cats can be weaned off it.  Talk to your vet about it, it may make a huge difference for her.  It's generally given once a day, and is fairly inexpensive, as it's a human drug which can be filled at your local pharmacy.|`|rLzfhCJxaa	both the UTI and grooming thing are food related, and the grooming thing is also related to the general extreme stress cause by being unable to pee. Being unable to pee is caused by lack of water intake.<br>  <br>  Switch her to a high quality canned food right away; no grains, no by-products, no unnamed meat.<br>  When you calculate dry matter values, protein should be above 40%, fat above 15%, and carbs below 10%. The extra water in the canned should solve her UTI problems, which in turn solve the grooming problems.<br>  <br>  Here's an example of how to calculate dry matter values:<br>  <br>  moisture: 78% and protein: 10%.<br>  Remove moisture from the 'total' (100%) and you get the percent of dry matter, which is 22%. Turn this into a decimal (0.22). Divide the protein content (10%) by this decimal (0.22). You end up with 45% protein as a dry matter value. You can do the same for fat, carbs, ash, fibre, etc.<br>  <br>  Good canned brands are the following:<br>  Wellness: <a href="http://www.wellnesspetfood.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.wellnesspetfood.com</a><br>  Evanger: <a href="http://www.evangersdogfood.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.evangersdogfood.com</a><br>  Nature's Variety: <a href="http://www.naturesvariety.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturesvariety.com</a><br>  Natural Balance: <a href="http://www.naturalbalance.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalbalance.net</a><br>  <br>  Your vet will probably tell you that these are bad foods, but please know that vets receive minimal nutritonal education and get benefits for selling stuff like Hill's Science Diet, Purina or Iams, so they'll try to keep you from buying anything else.|`|283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	Yes, I have a cat that was on them for just 2 days. The vet gave him elavil (amitriptyline). He had urinary infections and the vet thought they were caused by stress. They weren't as he stopped having them as soon as I got rid of the houseplant he was secretly peeing in. Anyways, the elavil did help him relax enough to go pee on his own after being catheterized. I did not like the way he just sat there and drooled and purred all day. He actually stopped eating and did not move so I never gave him another one. He took one pill in the morning. But like I said, I only gave him that for 2 days. That was several years ago and we have not had any problems since..and the houseplant did not come back in. It should work for your cat for her stress and help her get over the obsessive grooming and UTIs. Try finding and eliminating the source of the stress as that would be better than being on medication forever. It could be something as simple as furniture being re-arranged or it could be from a child or a visitor.|`|NQ7eOCdRaa	I worked at a vets many years ago and remember one case of a cat becoming depressed. The initial problem was that the cat had had a nasty fight and stopped going out. Next was trouble urinating and we found crystals in the urine and the cat was put on special diet, the cat didn't seem to get any better and finally we tried antidepressants. The cat seemed to make a recovery and started spending time in the garden. She needed to stay on special diet for as long as was aware but was an obviously happier cat. None of the vets I worked with had used antidepressants on a cat before and it was a last resort but it worked!|`|HIav9sVuaa	omgg pooor catt you should of asked the vet what to take and all the details

You also need a filter. I have a heater in with mine to make sure their water stays at 72 degrees F just in case.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Get the one which calls to you..LOL...no really.

G0KKfXMUaa	Squats.<br>  <br>  Squats, squats, and... more squats.<br>  <br>  They will make your legs, especially your thighs, ungodly strong if you are persistent with them.<br>  <br>  I warn you, however. You will be VERY sore after the first few times. But that's just a sign that they're working =)<br>  <br>  At first, do 2 to 3 sets of 10 to 15 squats per set, depending on how much your body can handle at first. Remember to keep your back straight and tall with your chin level.<br>  <br>  Once you can do three sets of fifteen easy, then add in weights, or a weight bar. (Hold the bar or weights while rising up and down)<br>  <br>  However, there's also some other exercises you could do, such as squats. Those help as well.<br>  <br>  However, it's also good to strengthen your inner core for trot work... which would mean building up your abs. So a few crunches wouldn't hurt.<br>  <br>  Remember to stretch good before workout. And if the squats make you VERY sore after, just take a good, long walk after and soak your legs in some hot water.<br>  <br>  The hard work will pay off and cause riding to come easier. <br>  <br>  Have fun =)|`|geeSX6HHaa	Do lots of squats.  Sink down as far to the ground as you can get without sitting and stand back up without using your hands.  Doing any kind of aerobics or jogging or even just walking can help.

It works great, I was skeptical that she wold let us put it on, but once she realized that it had her grain she was happy.|`|JcwQ4nK7aa	they have a purpose. if you have the need for one, why not? we use feed tubs, but whatever makes your horse happy....
uBFhKXgHaa	Just 'cute' names tacked onto mutts by backyard breeders trying to sell them off as a 'new breed'. Ridiculous, really.<br>  <br>  Darksong~|`|PM23RDycaa	Because the names make it seem like a REAL breed. Which is why you have so many people on here who got fed that line swearing up and down that their designer mutt is in fact a REAL breed. Of course they then don't want to listen to the fact that a NAME is not enough to make it a breed. <br>  <br>  People are sheep and bybs and puppymails want to make as much money as possible|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	designer names to get more money for mutts.|`|FVD1tpLeaa	its just to make money.  People will pay for a Labradoodle, not a Lab Poodle Mix.
h1zWBH4Uaa	i know petsmart does, but i am not to sure about petco. google a local pet store near you, get there number and call them up. that should save you sometimes an unnecessary drive...|`|uHCIxJmqaa	im sure they do call and ask them|`|ad7c42cce90c3663b9c47e1866a1347aaa	im sure they do, check their website first and then call if your local shop carrys them
szI6Y0CLaa	Every year I travel with my 2 cats from Florida to Nova Scotia and back again. The first day is the worst, one cat is nervous and foams at the mouth the other yowls and eventually throws up. Sounds awful but it's temporary, the second day they are fine.  I always start them off in a cage, lined with paper towel, one prefers to stay in the cage, the other likes to ride on the front seat. If they start to wander you must put them in a cage, it simply is not safe. I also have given my cats gravol (dramamine) for motion sickness, 12mg only. GIve an hour before leaving like humans.  Most pills are are a much stronger dose so you must cut them in half or a quarter to obtain the correct dose. It's an infant dose.  Do not feed your cat after midnight the day before, he should travel on an empty stomach.  If he is bothered by the drive he will be purrfectly fine and hungry as soon as you stop the drive for the day.|`|BJaQv8SGaa	i drove from the Northeastern part of the US to Florida last summer. my cat would occasionally climb under my seat, and lay near my pedals,  but he wasn't much of a problem considering he frequented himself in the back window when i or my fiance didn't catch him before he jumped up. lol. also we put a litter box on the floor, just in case. otherwise, we let him outside to go potty on his leash and harness. although, this may not be the solution for you. my cat tends to act more like a dog, and tends to be more outgoing and social than other cats i have come across.|`|w2JnfhNiaa	my cat hates trips but i puit a blanket in the back that i dont need. she can lay down and do everything else she needs to. also you can stop at restops and let her wak around. you can by a little leash and a flea collar....lol......but it works for me. when i go to west virginia from delaware|`|XUvaSO2Oaa	i think that u shouldnt take ur cat ith u because it would probaly crawl everywhere it would urine on the ground and it doesnt have food i think u should get someone u know that likes cats and let them take care of it|`|m16gf9mzaa	I strongly recommend spending the money on a medium-sized pet carrier - one that is big enough to put a small litter pan in, as well as leave room for the cat to stretch out. This is the kind of thing I mean:  <a href="http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/prod_display.cfm?c=3261+16901+9174&pcatid=9174" rel="nofollow">http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/pr...</a> and for a litter box you could maybe try a disposable one like this <a href="http://www.petco.com/product/9960/Kitty-s-WonderBox-Disposable-Cat-Litter-Box.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/product/9960/Kitty-...</a> or even a small aluminum foil baking pan if it would fit better. <br>  <br>   I moved from Arizona to Minnesota, a 4 day drive, with two cats in a really big carrier. It worked out pretty well for while we were in the car.  But one thing - learn from my mistake, and do not take the cat out of the carrier until it is inside your new home.  I put my cats on harnesses and leads to let them walk around at a rest stop, only to have a family with little kids come screaming at us.  One of the cats panicked, ran to the end of the leash and flipped out.  Literally. She flipped and flopped and pulled at the harness until it gave way.  She was running straight for the highway, but a bunch of strangers saw what was happening and blocked her path.  I would have lost her but for those people - I consider them angels.|`|gTQwwDQtaa	Hopefully she's up for a car ride!<br>  <br>  One of my cat loved them, my current one hates them and gets freaked out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Make her a little bed and let her explore, as long as she's not bothering your driving.<br>  <br>  As for kitty litter, I say take stops and let her stretch a bit outside and see if she'll go.
DqUi0xPhaa	Hi I took in a pregnant stray in april and she had 8 pups.<br>  <br>  2 looked like a mini border collie (now 32lbs)<br>  2 looked like a GSD (now 50lbs)<br>  2 were short little black buggers (now 35lbs)<br>  2 tall black buggers (now 40ish lbs)<br>  <br>  I spoke to the vet and he said either both parents were mixes and I got a variety or the litter could have more than 1 dad<br>  <br>  Here are some puppy pics...remember same litter mom is a corgi/lab/collie mix (or so the vet thinks) and is 40lbs<br>  <br>  Border collie looking<br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v323/caitlynsmommy/105_1457-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v323/c...</a><br>  <br>  Shepherd looking<br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v323/caitlynsmommy/105_1423.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v323/c...</a><br>  <br>  Mom and all babies<br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v323/caitlynsmommy/105_1421.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v323/c...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck with your new pup|`|FVD1tpLeaa	They're all mixes.  The genes aren't going to line up the same way if every puppy.  I'd definitely recommend waiting till they are 8-9 weeks of age before taking them from the litter.  Very important socialization skills are learned during that time, and it's skills that they can only get from litter mates.  Waiting those extra 2 weeks will save you years of training.|`|rCNRcF5waa	One thing that's weird about dogs, is that it's possible for puppies from one litter to have multiple fathers. It's possible that the dog got knocked up by several different dogs while she was in heat. But it is also possible that the puppies just aren't developed enough yet to see their similarities. :D|`|4zp6Uz2Haa	They are heinz 57...No one knows whats actually in there.  I think they look like they could be from the same litter though.  Just different hair coats which is normal for mix breeds.  (And some poorly bred full blooded breeds)<br>  <br>  btw, there's a lot more than 4 possible out comes on what the pups will look like.  Each characteristic could be different based on what genes are there, which are recessive, which are dominant, etc.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	If mom was a stray, and they don't have her history, it's possible the pup have different fathers.  Or that dad was also a mix that added to the mix.  Har har.|`|E80oq8bIaa	its becouse traits from the grandparents can be passed down to the grandchildren not just traits from the mother and father|`|c93ea3c8cf1c3dd9a0e3b461289096d9aa	Genetics, same reason human brothers and sisters can look completely unrelated.|`|Do2pJx8Aaa	Its always possible that there are multiple fathers involved.|`|d4PWpSIWaa	Dogs are like people, they will pick up different characteristics from their gene pool.  Puppies may not look the same, just like brothers and sisters don't look the same.  My dog is a lab/collie and I have meet other lab/collies who look nothing like him.<br>  <br>  It is all about genetics, especially is the father is also a mutt.|`|RxhBUkwSaa	They are very cute!  Good for you for wanting a good ol' mutt!  Our shepard/lab mutt came from a little half of whom looked like black labs, and the other half like rottweilers. <br>  <br>  Dogs can have more than one father per litter.  As long as they mate with her at the right moment, the litter-mates might really only be half siblings!|`|wJS6O9U1aa	It is because the more dominate gene will determine what they look like, and since they are mixes there are more genes that they can get. Just think about people brothers and sisters don't look exactly the same, except identical twins, but that's a completly different concept.|`|a1EYZNQNaa	becausethe genes can be hybrid, dominant, or recessive. curly hair is recessive, and straight is dominant, so it really just depends on the genes that they inheirited. oh and btw, wavy is hybrid. hope this helps =]|`|CscCdffnaa	I'm sure the father was a different breed, so one puppy dominantly took ont the traits of the mother & the other the father.|`|IUuUoiZhaa	one puppy can look more like one of the mother's breeds or both and another could look like the dad or the oppisite breed of the mother!!|`|LMbkHGYiaa	Puppies aren't identical twins. Each pup has a different genetic makeup than it's brothers and sisters. When they are purebred the genetics are so similar that the differences are minor, for example, size or fur patterns. In the case of mixed breeds like these pups the gene pool is much larger and there differences are much more apparent. This means you can't tell for sure how big the dog will be. The good news is mixed breeds are generally much healthier than purebreds since they are not as prone to genetic diseases and inbreeding.|`|iembGsl9aa	Because they are mixes. <br>  So there's GSD and lab we no for sure. And the father is unknown. <br>  So assuming hes purebred (assume breed x) there culd be pups that resemble breed x mixed with a GSD and pups that look like breed x mixed with labs.<br>  Or the father culd be a mutt, so x and y breeds.<br>  GSD/ x<br>  GSD/ y<br>  Lab/ x<br>  Lab/ y<br>  <br>  So "4" possible outcomes for any of the pups.<br>  <br>  On top of that, there can be multiple fathers 2 a litter. Which could add a whole entire endless amount of possibilities. <br>  <br>  Products of mutt breeding never turn out as "exacts" like with labradoodles, some r born with the lab length coat opposed to the curly poodle coat. Yet others in the litter will get the curls.|`|bIaywrBCaa	they may have multiple fathers. Even with just being a mixture of GSD and lab they can look very different. Cute pups by the way. I wouldn't worry about what other breeds may be in there.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	They are mixes so one takes after one parent and the other takes after another parent. It's also entirely possible they have different fathers.|`|4WszPA0Paa	OMFG PUPPIES!!!! haha<br>  <br>  it's basic genetics... just like humans.<br>  <br>  color is percentages of dominant and recessive genes.... different ratios in the mom and dad mix to get the puppy.. just like ur mom and dad :) only in a dogs case, their can be multiple fathers<br>  <br>  this is why breeding purebreeds are so hard nowadays... i love mixes anyways :)|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	The could have different fathers,but also,a lot of Labs and Rotts will have wavy hair as puppies,so there may be Lab,Rott or both in the mix.Cute pups.|`|1ad7aa5Caa	The pups could have been fathered by diiferent dogs. It's possible. <br>  I hope you aren't paying anything more than $20. Any more for mixed puppies is a rip off. ;)|`|3p3otDlXaa	To me they don't.
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	I have a bad habit of overfeeding, so mine get a sprinkle of food once a day. I just have endlers livebearers (tiny wild cousins of the Guppy). My shrimp tank gets an algae wafer every other day.<br>  <br>  p.s. some people have some SHOCKING tank set ups, Goldfish need 20 gallon tanks, I wouldn't even keep a shrimp in a 1 gallon! As for that 50g with silver tip sharks (potentially 2ft long and brackish) with Goldfish and who knows what else, YIKES! people should have to sit a test before they buy fish.|`|qEp9fxU9aa	Depends on the type of fish.  There are grazers that pick all day and should be fed appropriately and there are preditors that should eat a large meal and not be fed for a few to several days.<br>  <br>  Examples:<br>  <br>  A 12 lbs. large mouth bass can eat an 8 lbs. fish and will not need to eat again for a long time.<br>  <br>  A herbivore, geophagus, detris eater, sponge eater, scale eater, and other specialty eaters that eat a large quantitiy of low nutrician foods should be fed as often as possible.<br>  <br>  Most fish fall in between these extreams and most people adapt them to their schedule of once as much as they'll eat within 5 minutes, once in the morning and once at night though that's a very general rule of thumb doesn't work for many fish.|`|GNmzjDHHaa	It is recomended to feed ur fish once a day at the same time and only as much as they can eat, i wait for 20 mins, at a time.  I have a 50 gal tank  2 silver tipped sharks, 10  or 12 neons and some fantail goldfish.It is particioned and on the small side I have a japanese fighting fish.

I feed them twice a day with a mixture of brine shrimp, bloodworms, tuber worms, etc.<br>  <br>  I agree that goldfish should not be kept in anything less than 20g for the first and 10g for each additional (at least).  they also need great filters, aeration, etc.  Beside the point though.|`|8CvWbN5Caa	I fed mine two times a day, one in the morning, once at night!<br>  <br>  He was a beta and had a pretty small tank.<br>  <br>  He lived for two years!

9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	This is pretty common.  They actually make a product you can sprinkle on your dogs food so that when she poops and then eats it, it will taste terrible.  Feed it to her until she decides to give up the habit. She should stop after trying to eat it a few times. Here is a link to order some or you can probably get it from a pet store or your local pet hospital:<br>  <a href="http://www.entirelypets.com/forbid.html?ysmcpn=forbid&ysmchn=YAH&ysmtac=PI" rel="nofollow">http://www.entirelypets.com/forbid.html?...</a>|`|HIwJFtNlaa	My dog used to eat her poop too.  We tried to keep her away from it as much as possible by scooping it up whenever we can and trying to keep her in her kennel whenever we went out. So I guess the only way you can keep her from eating her poop is keeping it away from her. I do know another method that may not seem as humane, but you can make a cayenne pepper/ vinegar solution and spray it on the poop to make it taste bad. I know it may not be nice, but it's a common practice. People also spray their furniture with that so that their dogs won't chew on the furniture. Anyways, I hope I hope I helped!|`|SQQFnb3Qaa	Birdgirl has some good input, try some additives such as , grapefruit juice, canned pumpkin, and commercial product called Deter. They will all make the poop taste bad (but I have never verified :-)). Never feed the Chi grapes or raisins thinking this will make the poop taste bad, grapes and raisins are toxic to Chi's.|`|m1ypmbNKaa	It could be possible that the dog need food after it poops right away.You can ask your question in Pets>Dogs there will be more people answering.|`|y2woLnrPaa	Mine does too...I think they like it...|`|4lHob4JUaa	she learns from what she see's.|`|b7GPGGZcaa	A vet told my friend that her dog was eating its poo because he needed more protein.  She was feeding him cheaper dog food.  Up the quality of the food.  There is also a powder you can get to put in its food that makes the poo taste very bitter.
IMPvzBk1aa	If you can restrict the amount of sweet feed at each meal, you can reduce the high he is getting.  Grain enters the blood as sugar and ups the insulin level, which is part of the problem.  The other is if it isn't completely digested in the fore gut, the grain starches move to the hind gut and cause a bacterial upset that produces a conditon of acidosis, which also is a metabolic upset and contributes to "hot" behavior.  Feeding a smaller amount, like under 2 lbs at one feeding, these effects are reduced. You can also feed hay first and it helps.  If feeding less grain more often doesn't work, then you should replace it with beet pulp or try a complete feed like equine senior which are not cereal grains and won't cause the high.<br>  <br>  Does the new trailer have good mats?  I've seen some horses paw when they didn't like the mats, or if there were no mats.  Otherwise it could be the smell, or anything different from what he is used to.|`|5i8lDbXfaa	Grain:  First I need to know how much exercise your horse does.  Sweet feed brands like Purina have different mixes for different lifestyles.  If your horse is not ridden everyday, then you might consider a less protien feed, like 10%.  Like PRS, I too use horsemen's edge.  My horse has been on it for almost 4 years, over the that time I have switched protien percentages depending on how much riding I was doing yearly.  Remember to gradually transition feed when switching.<br>  <br>  Check out their website for other feed types<br>  This might help too:<br>  <a href="http://horse.purinamills.com/products/feedingcalculator.asp" rel="nofollow">http://horse.purinamills.com/products/fe...</a>|`|BiUNuyfFaa	Well I don't think the trailer is causing your horses problem. You should get a vet check or teach your horse to stop the bad habit.<br>  <br>  I feed my horse a coffee can of Ultium and 2 coffee cans of alfalfa pellets.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ultium.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ultium.com/</a>|`|8Rn2pX4jaa	Even though he may be getting the same amount of grain as he was before, it may have a lot more cals and protein and that may be the reason behind his hot attitude.  You should be able to get the breakdown of protein and cals for the grain.  I would compare that to what he was getting before and he may just be getting a lot more energy than before.  Sweet feed often has a lot of sugar, corn and oats that give the horses a lot more cals.<br>  <br>  I would think the trailer is also related to his feed.  You could try cutting back on his feed to see if he is better behaved.  Is the trailer different (straight load vs slant load?)  If it is, he may not be used to how he is standing.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!  I would check his feed and probably cut back how much he is eating.|`|AA11570905	The problem in the trailer could just be a continuation and another symptom of the problem with the feed.  What percentage of protien is the feed he is getting?  I would be feeding 10% sweet feed if he isn't in full work.  Also make sure he is getting plenty of good quality grass hay.  I feed the horse I ride all the time 1/2 strategy pellets and 1/2 12% Horsemans Edge sweet feed.  He does very well on it.  The pasture ornaments get Equine Sr and some 10% sweet feed.<br>  <br>  I live in Georgia and fall and Winter is our best riding weather so their diet doesn't change so much with the seasons.|`|EQvAbyvcaa	As most sweet feeds contain a lot of sugars, molasses, corn, oats, they can be a high energy producing food source.  My opinion, it is garbage food.  Better to use a good balanced feed with adequate vitamins and minerals well suited to the type and amount of forage your horse gets on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  The trailer just smells funny and is a new place for him to conquer.  Take your time.  Be patient, Introduce him and allow him to check it out.  He will learn that it is OK to go in and get off and he won't die.  When you prove that to him, he will load fine.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you are trying your best.  Just read some lables to get him what he needs for food and forage and help him maintain good condition and enough energy for the stamina he needs to do his work.  Forget about what the other horses get, you have to be specific and give particular thought and care about the nutrition of your horse.  Do what is best for him.|`|BKXMl8E8aa	Hey, Ok all sweet feed really does is keep the horse's belly warm and give'sm a rush. I still give it to my horse's during the winter though cause they need the extra energy to keep warm. I start feeding it by October stop feeding it in the middle of February or the beginning of March depending on the weather. When you moved you really shoulda not gave in like that either lol he woulda ate it when he got good and hungry enough to; a lota times sugar will make a horse mean. You can feed'm corn that's sweet or put some apple's or carrot shave'ns in there. On the trailor part he's just bored really, give'm some Bermuda hay to eat in there and make sure there's rubber mat's and safety wraps and what not, but he'll get over it just give'm somethin to do. On the weight part when I get a horse that can't maintain weight put the booger on corn, oats, liquid747, and WHEAT GERM OIL. E-mail me lil_punkin323@yahoo.com I'll explain more.
9825a4accf342d98abca06fdb35d659aaa	Some dogs naturally bark more than others, but barking is something you can train your dog to stop doing. If he only barks when he's playing with the other dog training him may be more difficult, as that's his way of communicating while playing. If he's barking at other times you can tell him "quiet". When he is quiet reward him with praise. You might want to use treats for rewards too--especially at first. Be sure you aren't accidentally "rewarding" him for barking. If he barks and you pet him or play with him to get him to be quiet he'll learn that barking is a good thing. He's still very young and I think if you start working with him now you will be able to quiet him down.|`|bIaywrBCaa	adults don't normally bark as much as pups do.|`|3p3otDlXaa	both.  either or.  you can train him not to bark some.  i mean you do what you want. he may not obey 100%.|`|3pLv7KBvaa	all dogs bark but there a time you need to control there barking and set a limit.<br>  <br>  my dad has three dogs and he bought one for me who is the smart dog (harley) he like bark/talks not excatly how to explain it trying to get it a toy. (ill show you want i mean)|`|UE4WbmtQaa	usually dogs get calmer and bark less when they get older. however the problem is that you probably dont excercise him enough. those kind of dogs need lots of excercise and if they dog get it then they get bored. boredom leads to distructiveness and annoying things like barking.|`|CsjQ8kIkaa	u have to train him out of it my puppy does the same thing now he stops because we stared going to puppy training at petsmart|`|ZxLzNWvkaa	He might settle down a little bit but you have to snap him out of the barking if it gets too anoying; just so he knows anough is anough.<br>  yes he's gunna bark yet still hes just a puppy, but your the dominante one so you should get trianing him not to bark.<br>  Just let him know when thats anough barking.<br>  He's just having funn.|`|YVjmzAtQaa	When the puppy gets older it will be more relaxed and will not bark as much as puppies|`|ZS6GHluraa	it just really depends on the dog. i dont think your little puppy will just natrually stop barking as he grows up. my golden retriever pup NEVER used to bark. i was always curious of how his voice sounds. around 8months -ish he started barking. lol if you dont want your dog to bark even more as he grows up i suggest training. ignore him when hes barking (because a lot of the times he'll bark to get attention) and when he stops, reward him. (key point: remember that your rewarding him for being quiet, not for barking) puppies do bark when they play, but if their habit of barking isn't fixed, they can be one loud dog! :)
FVD1tpLeaa	I'm personally a Rottie person myself, but if you don't know much about the dogs, I'd go with a Lab.  A Rott is DEFINITELY not for a first time dog owner, especially if you're not prepared for lots and lots of ongoing training.  Training is a MUST for both breeds, but Rotties are more demanding.|`|bIaywrBCaa	I have owned both and currently have 2 lab mixes but I think I prefer the rottie. They are just a little too much around my chihuahuas, not mean, but just play too rough for them.|`|2p5VsmZhaa	I have a Lab, my Uncle has a Rottie. Labradors are great dogs that love everyone, require some training, and don't mind kids. They'll do about anything for attention. They do need exercise though, and are great chewers that will happily feast on anything, to their owners expense. They also sometimes do have separation anxiety, where they miss you a lot, and of course, chew up your shoes, wood, cords, anything. The cure for this is somebody with them, T.V. doesn't work. Just somebody with them. In some cases you can train them out of this, but sometimes all they want is attention.<br>  <br>  Rotties are great, too but do require more grooming and exercise. They're big dogs, and will gladly lean on you like a big baby. They are very lovable, though, but can snap at you if you annoy them too much,<br>  but just don't mess with them too much, and teach your kids, if you have any, to play, but don't tug and yank. They make awesome guard dogs, too, and can easily frighten strangers due to their bark. Keep in mind they are friendly, but just want to guard you. Again, teach your kids, if any, that this or any other dog doesn't want to hurt them, just is barking.<br>  <br>  There's plenty more information, but remember that all dogs have <br>  original personalities, and the dog you choose will be a personal member of your family. It's your choice, so good luck finding your new dog.|`|4zp6Uz2Haa	Whichever one they have locked in a tiny cage at the animal shelter... Also, whichever one has been through basic obedience training and hasn't been allowed to do as they please.<br>  <br>  A trained dog is a happy dog.<br>  <br>  Please visit your local shelter/humane society or go through a specific breed rescue group to get your new family member.|`|UTw3QefOaa	Rotties are big; you'd have to know a lot about the breed.  There's a rottie at the shelter I work at named Boscoe.  He's the biggest sweetheart I've ever met.  He even loves getting bathed.  <br>  <br>  But personally, I have two labs and I can honestly say, I've never had better dogs.<br>  <br>  Rotties are very loyal and my best friend had one growing up.  It got in trouble for biting some people because they were threatening the "owner" but I don't want that to scare you...Any dog will bite.  Even my cocker spaniel growing up took pieces out of me.  But, Rotties are extremely loyal and if you're looking for a dog that will dedicate itself to you, a Rottie is a great choice.<br>  <br>  Labs are equally as loyal, and maybe more smart.  I got my lab mix about a year and a half ago, and I've just been amazed at all she can do.  Labs are terrifically smart and loyal animals.  They're the most popular breed in America for a reason.  I promised myself I wouldn't get a lab, just because they're SO popular.  But I eventually found one at the shelter I work at, who was so emaciated and sick, and finally I took her home.<br>  <br>  Both dogs are amazing breeds.  If you've had dogs before, get a Rottie.  If this is your first dog, get a lab.  Labs are a little more gentle.|`|uKW6HUSOaa	Technically speaking, there are no better or best dogs, but I understand where you stand. So, personally, I'd pick the Rottweiler.
pa2zhzzQaa	I don't think this will harm your fish if you rinse the container out with water pretty good before you put the food in it i have done this before and have never had any problems with my fish.|`|dB3Gu0Ypaa	no do not do that you adorable fish could die keep it in a not soap container hopefully they will be fine
Whh0G1eJaa	Remember that when you have fish shipped, you are paying for the water that they are transported in, which weighs about 8 pounds a gallon.<br>  <br>  Try www.tfdfish.com  Tropical Fish Distributers  877-229-2300<br>  <br>  I just ordered a whole bunch of unusual fish and shipping was reasonable and his prices are unbelievable!  Like 80 cents for a cory cat.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	The reason shipping is so high, is because it costs alot to properly ship fish. There are a few places that will ship without a warranty on the fish for 15 bucks, but still. If you want to order fish online, expect to pay alot for shipping.<br>  <br>  Go to a local shop, and ask them to order you what you want. much cheaper.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Try Premium aquatics. They are a better store anyways.<br>  That being said, you do know that they must be shipped over night, and in water, in large Styrofoam boxes multi-bagged, possibly multi-boxed maybe with heating/cooling packs. Shipping live animals isn't cheap, and this is one thing you don't want them to cut corners on.|`|tMlwcim8aa	eBay. Ocassionally they'll have free shipping, and some times cheaper than $35. But honestly, though you can't find cheap online prices because do you realize how this is so bad in a seller's market? They have to buy expensive heating and cooling pads, insulated boxes, plants, and breather bags, so you won't recieve a dead fish. They HAVE to ship next day or else your fish will die. I asked this same exact question before and realized: you can't get good deals online unless you buy a lot of fish to outweigh the price of the shipping. I love Live Aquaria, but you need to buy in bulk to keep prices down. <br>  <br>  Also: Aqua Bid. eBay for aquarists.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|AA11925457	thoes ate exotic and if u are going that way i would find a local shop for them insted that way u can see the fish u get
AA11901352	No worries depending on their age and breeding they can take up to 80 days to actually have a brood.  Nothing to worry about (except that she may expload)   28 days is a group average not an exact number.<br>  <br>  Same with mollies.  Mine took 72 days to deliver and she ended up having over 78 fry.  Really unless you see her acting weird, no worries.  Not an exact number here.  She will have them when she is ready
fgxajTiBaa	First off, there is no such thing as a Mini Yorkie. There is Yorkshire Terriers, they are in the Toy group and they are supposed to be between 4-7 lbs. No such thing as "Toy" "Mini" "Teacup" or any added description onto them.<br>  <br>  In terms of a good food, basically anything that has meat as a first ingredient, no meat by products, no corn products and has limited amounts of fillers. I feed my dog California Natural, I think it's a great food.|`|26PPwzrWaa	Mini is a scam. You must of bought her for 600 and been scammed. <br>  The first answerer was also scammed into buying a toy yorkie. <br>  <br>  Yorkies come in one size: that is 5 to 7 lbs. No less than 5 for a breeding female, no more than 7 for males.

Being that it is "mini" the best food for it would be its mother for at least the next 5 weeks!!<br>  Sorry but thats just my opinion|`|0ZrRRGmiaa	The BEST puppy food in my opinion is by far, hands down, is Hills Science Diet Puppy Small Bites. It is amazing!!! I used to fight with my chihuahuas to eat Iams, Purina, anything really and then I bought this stuff. They love it and are extremely healthy. It is more pricey but with a small dog the price isn't that bad because the food lasts soooo long. The pieces of food are so tiny, they have no problem with it.|`|A0cITPNuaa	I've always used Eukanuba for all my dogs.  It is one of the top of the line brands, very healthy and creates a beautiful, shiny coat.|`|3O6CTb3saa	I have used Purina puppy chow but Science diet makes some good ones too.  When they start eating it's a good idea to put a little puppy canned food mixed in and then they eat it better.

Then, if you want to change brands, do it gradually.

You could lie a little and say you found it or your friend has to get rid of it or something like that. Play on thier sympathy for abandoned, sick animals. Then say you would pay for it and such. It might work, it might not. It depends on you parents.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	dont do it.<br>  <br>  what kind of a life can you give it if your parents dont want it?<br>  <br>  when you get your own place, adopt from a shelter.|`|LB3Rgpioaa	If you're pet gets sick vets fees are huge, in the hundreds.<br>  Forget about it.|`|EYjsBzsYaa	Wait. I know it sucks  but if your parents say no, they won't change their minds.|`|UrGfHxRVaa	I think it would be best for you and any future animal you wish to share your life with, that you wait until you have your own place and you are finacially stable to handle the expense of caring for an animal.  I have spent many thousands of my hard earned dollars on my cats, food, bedding, cat carriers, litter and trays, not to mentions all the shots and treatments, spaying/neutering and of course there are the big expenses....Sick Animal Vet Bills.  When you love your animal, you will go the extra mile to save their lives (as you should) and it is VERY COSTLY.  I was offered $1,000.00 for one of my Tabby Cats (Niki) sight unseen, just on my description of him and his loveable personality.  I just amazed me that one of my customers in the store wanted him that bad, but I refused that offer because my animals are not for sale.  One year later that very same Tabby Cat (Niki) cost me over $1,000.00 in vet bills, that time. Niki alone has been in to see the vet over 6 times.  See there are no guarantees that animals will all be healthy and when they are not, they rely on you for help.  I paid the money for his life and he lived on with love in his heart.  $$$$$$$$$$$$$<br>  <br>  I truly believe you would be better off waiting for the right time in your life, as this is a life long decision and commitment.  There is so much ahead for you in your life and you will not be happy if you have someone holding you back.  <br>  <br>  It is also not fair to the 2 people who have always been there for you, if you deceive them.  These 2 people who have loved you, fed you, cared for you when you are sick, played with you and yes scolded you because of the love that they feel for you.  <br>  <br>  How could you think to hurt them with a lie as suggested above in someone elses answer?  <br>  <br>  Again, how could you go against the wishes of the same 2 people who will be there for you for the rest of your life and the lives of your future family?<br>  <br>  What will be more important to you, the repair on your car so you can take a date out or shots for your cat?<br>  <br>  Going to the Prom all dress up with an amazing date on your arm or paying the vet for a sick visit?<br>  <br>  Buying the coolest new video game or whatever you like or buying cat food and litter because your animal is hungry?<br>  <br>  Making a decision on paying your bills and rent or paying for an operation to keep your cat alive?<br>  <br>  Just a little bit for you to think about, answer these questions to yourself and see if you are completely happy with your answers.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't Worry Some Family will adopt the little kitten.<br>  Have a Wonderful Day!!!|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Please do NOT buy this kitten from a pet store.  Its probably from a kitten mill or backyard breeder and overpriced, poor quality and sick.  When you buy from a pet store, you only encourage them to get more stock from unhealthy places.|`|AA11459417	I have several concerns about this situation.  <br>  <br>  First -- you saw the kitten and wanted it.  Then, only a matter of minutes later, you changed your mind.  Then you changed your mind again yesterday.  Do you realize that getting a kitten is a 15 to 20-year commitment and you have to be absolutely 100 percent sure, 100 percent of the time, that you're willing to make that commitment.<br>  <br>  Second -- you're planning to do this without your parents' knowledge or permission.  That shows a real lack of maturity, so I don't think you're mature enough to make the commitment to take care of a kitten appropriately.  If your parents don't want the kitten, what will you do when you grow up and move out of the house?  If you go to college, you should know that dorms don't allow pets, so your parents will probably be stuck with the responsibility that you've dumped on them.<br>  <br>  Third -- you said that you will pay for all of the costs of the kitten.  I wonder if you even realize how much it costs to have a pet and keep it healthy.  Besides food, you have to make sure it's always up to date on its vaccinations, and those aren't cheap.  There's also the cost of monthly treatments to prevent heart worms, round worms, fleas and ticks.  Those things are all just regular maintenance costs.  Now you have to figure that you'll need money to pay for any illnesses or injuries that might happen, and believe me, they DO happen sometimes.  My niece's cat tried to climb the shower curtain and fell and broke one of its legs, and it cost her a total of $1,500 to get it taken care of.  And treating an illness can cost hundreds of dollars.  Do you have that kind of money?<br>  <br>  Fourth -- you're planning to get this kitten from a pet store, which is a big NO-NO.  Pet stores get their animals from puppy or kitten mills, since no reputable breeder would ever sell their animals to a pet store.  The mills are horrible places and many of the animals are mistreated, sick and/or have behavioral problems because they were taken from their mothers too early.  When you buy a pet at a pet store, you're helping to financially support those mills, which, in turn, keeps them in business.  I can't stress strongly enough that you should avoid getting a kitten from a pet store!  Besides the moral issues, there are financial issues -- you'll probably have to spend a lot of money in veterinary care to take care of the health problems that so many pet store animals have.<br>  <br>  I know that I didn't tell you what you wanted to hear, but hopefully, I gave you something to think about.  Just remember -- a kitten isn't a cute little toy -- it's a living creature that requires a HUGE commitment and a lot of money to take care of.  So why don't you show how mature you can be and pass up on that kitten for now?

Otherwise, he would sleep on the floor. I could never get him to sleep in a hammock, he would only use them for climbing on. I got a new cage recently, and I have seen him spend several hours snoozing in one of the hammocks. And some rats just aren't hammock rats. They just prefer sleeping on the floor or in a box. They need to decide for themselves if they want to use the hammock.|`|f7f979166d56e9db52bddbf243ac866daa	I would say putting a scrap of cloth or fleece that they can burrow into and under would help a lot.

I'd suggest getting your new cat spayed as soon as possible, giving it some time to adjust and become less stressed in your new home, and give her positive reinforcement when she uses the litter box correctly. (And when you say her litter box and that the other cat is using both - it's advised to have one litter box per cat, but both cats will end up using both litter boxes. You aren't going to be able to get them to use separate boxes.)|`|ae35d2fe9bbb801f9a5273f2a156f8eaaa	First off,Get the female spayed. That will bring the cats fighting to a more calmer stage,But not to a point where that is the end of it. When your cat is doing unwanted behavior,It is wise to stop it the second you notice it. For instance,The swatting. You could spray the cat with water or make loud noises to scare the cat from fighting.If she tries to use his litter box,Try to pick her up before she begins and move her to her litter box. The more often you do it, The more your cat should realize which is hers. I have a question as well,Do you think the cats are fighting for your affection? If your in a room, and they seem to fight, Leave the room, and if the cats cared, they would stop. if not just spray them (lol).Thats all i know, hope it helped :3|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Are they both neutered/spayed?

But I understand why you would try them with a puppy that can't go out. You might just want to call your vet and ask that question. The people who answer the phones can usually answer questions like that.

As your pleco grows, it will begin needing a bigger tank, because as you know, they can grow to be almost 2 feet long.

The longer you wait the more options you'll see.) You're in no rush though, so if you just want your 37 gal. to seem like a new tank without your tropicals, then I would add the BN pleco in later. It's really up to you. And they don't grow too fast, but give it a year and it'll either be close to full grown or full grown. <br>  <br>  Note: Plecos have been seen to suck on to other fish sometimes, especially slow moving fish that get too close, like goldfish. This may potentially hurt the goldfish's slime coat, give it an infection, and cause it to die. <br>  <br>  However, I doubt this will happen, but I just thought I'd warn you, cause my common pleco tried that with one of my silver dollars. Luckily my silver dollar took off fast enough.

8cikAYp3aa	Do Not roach his mane.  while you may like the idea.  your horse already appears to have a long neck that is a bit thin and underdeveloped along the topline.  removing his mane will only make that more noticeable.  find a friend with photo shop  and edit out his mane, you'll see what I mean.    the horse in the picture you like has a well rounded topline to his neck, and alot of muscle in the crest.  mind you a well done roach can fool the eye in to believing there is more to the neck then is really there.  But a judge will see it for what it is.|`|aKSicRp9aa	Roached manes look good on some horses, but I honestly don't think it would look right on your horse. I think it looks better on horses that are more bulky or muscular.<br>  I have an 18 yr old gelding that I want to roach because he's soooo stocky.  He has a very long thick mane and it makes him look like a shaggy pony. On my 4 yr old slender mustang, I would never roach his mane.<br>  One thing about roaching, it usually makes their mane grow back thicker.|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	In UK we call it a hogged mane.  I do not like them except on medical grounds.  Horses need their manes for protection against flies (and there are no good, legal fly sprays for horses) and midges and in winter they might need some for protection against the cold.<br>  <br>  Long skinny necks certainly do not look good with a hogged (roached) mane and really only a cobby type would look half decent.  Hogged manes take a lot of maintenance to keep them looking good.  Clipping every few weeks - and it is not as easy as you might think!|`|ejj2N3uaaa	Personally, I dislike the look of roached manes. I also don't really like long manes (although my jumper has a long mane because he's half-Arab and we showed for years on the Arab circuit). However, if you do like it, go for it. I don't think you'll achieve quite the same look just because your horse's conformation--particularly his neck--is nothing like the conformation of the other horse. You might get the same mane (which looks like it was roached then grown out a little bit), but that won't last long anyway, and it won't have the same effect. <br>  <br>  If you're wanting to show, I wouldn't roach his mane. Instead, I would cut it to where it's only a few inches long and then pull it to thin it and even it out. If you are showing at nicer shows, you should also band it for western. If you're doing like speed events or another non-judged class, it really doesn't matter what you do (same for trail riding).|`|Fuej6dMPaa	i've always used clippers to give my mare a mohawk. i really like the whole roached/mohawk(when it starts to grow out) look. i know on my mare it made her neck look massivly large. theres really no way to tell if he'll look good or not, just go for it and roach it. If it looks bad, its only hair and it will always grow back.|`|HXVaqUjXaa	Don't do it! Your horse does not have the neck for it. You will not be happy with the end result and it takes a long time to grow back out. The first horse has a neck much more suitable for roaching. Short with a little crest to it. Your horse does not.|`|pTmrZicfaa	I have a QH/Cross, more QH and I'm thinking about roaching his mane as well. I talked to my trainer and I showed her the same picture, because I like that mane too, and she said it'll eventually grow in like that. If you don't like it it will grow back pretty normal in about 5-6 months.<br>  And basically all you do is treat his whole mane like a bridle path and clip it with clippers.<br>  BUT do make sure he has good neck muscle!!! That way it will stand nicely =)<br>  Good luck!!<br>  <br>  P.S. it looks like he's pretty fuzzy right now, so make sure it's warmer when you do it. That way his neck won't get too cold! They like their manes when it's cold out =)<br>  <br>  I also noticed your other post about his mane being really thin, roaching his mane (even if it turns out really ugly) will most likely make his mane thicker too! So it might be a good idea if you want him to have a thicker mane, to do it anyway.<br>  <br>  If your showing western, it might not be such a good idea.|`|an1L8njXaa	sorry but your horse realy doesnt have the neck to carry off a hog (roach)<br>  <br>  to make one look good your horse would need a very big muscley well developed neck!<br>  <br>  If you roach your horse he will look like he has a weedy neck that is out of proportion with his body|`|LAXxaxAZaa	I don't like roached manes at all, so I'll keep my mouth shut about that.<br>  <br>  <br>  But as for getting it to look like the horse in the picture, I think you'll just have to shave it completely off, and wait about a week for it to grow back. That's exactly what my horses' bridle paths look like when they need to be redone.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT -- Yeah, you can use the same size the whole way down.

aJRP6WWYaa	Bunny's make great indoor pets. They can be litter box trained. They need vaccinations like a dog or cat. You can let them have run of the house but I'd put it in a cage at night.|`|6uo0NbUgaa	It depends on what you want out of a pet.  They can smell a little but they can also be kept outside.  My bunny is in a cage outside that we put a blanket over when it gets cold.  It's best to have the cage raised up so that its poop can fall into a bucket below.  Bunnies usually poop in the same corner but I don't think there is a way to tell your bunny which corner to poop in.  Bunnies are in the cage for a majority of the time so it needs to be fairly large.  You should always let your bunny out in a safe closed-in area because they like to wander.  I wouldn't let them roam freely around the house unless your house is "bunny safe" and doesn't have any other pets.  Bunnies don't need shots unless they are in contact with other animals.|`|lif8jpq0aa	My friend had three bunnies there cute but not great pets!

AraBfesHaa	All you need is one male and one female in the same tank.  You don't need to do anything.  But be warned, with one mating, the female stores the sperm and releases fry (up to 80+ each batch) every month for up to 6 months.  That's alot of fish you'll have to provide room for, so be prepared to buy more tanks.<br>  The female is pregnant for about 4 weeks.<br>  Two months after birth, the fry will be ready to start reproducing themselves.  you'll be overrun with them very quickly.  There's no way to stop them unless you totally separate the males and females into different tanks every time the female has a batch before they're old enough to mate.|`|dbZvPW3Haa	you need 1 male 3 females and let nature take its course, it will be about 28 days to give birth, however you could do with a hospital/quarantine tank with a sponge filter for the female to give birth and to let have some piece to recover.|`|rrLHU6ehaa	1 male + 1 female.<br>  Temp preferrably near 80 F.<br>  <br>  About 28-30 days.|`|d8f443bc582285db859040a0c5e47adcaa	depending on temperature it is approx.24/28 days.i would suggest you put some cover for the fry to hide as the parents like a live meal|`|UzgiHbonaa	See:<br>  <a href="http://www.aquariumfish.net/information/raising_baby_fish.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquariumfish.net/information/...</a><br>  For general stuff.<br>  and:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_anatomy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_anatom...</a><br>  for other stuff and the mechanics of it all - look at the bit about Internal fertilisation.<br>  <br>  Lots of weed, real or artificial is a help, as this allows the fry to hide from the other fish who will eat them.<br>  Some people advocate separate breeding tanks. I find these kill more fry and mothers then if they were eaten.<br>  Keeping the light on in the tank also helps, as the fry may wander out in the dark only to be consumed.<br>  Crunch the flake food up a bit between (clean and no detergents) fingers, the fry may find the tiny bits easier to consume.<br>  <br>  You will get a whole load of fry (maybe 30-40?) from one female.

cLhF7DM9aa	Personality wise they are both pretty good, really docile snakes, you generally don't get more aggression from one sex with snakes, if a species is calm then it's both genders. I will say that females get slightly larger than males at full grown but with royals only getting to around 4-5 feet anyway it shouldn't make much difference. Try and handle both if you can and buy the one you get a feel for.|`|114a9e7f24177ba552a0e5c76a745e27aa	wow you can afford an albino? I have a ball "royal" python. My is a male.

R0WgaUdgaa	Hey hun,<br>  Please try not to worry about it so much. If you are that concerned then please take him into the vet and have him checked out.<br>  I have 3 girls and one squeaks for about the first 3 minutes she is up. I have had her for about a year and to this day I have no idea why she does but every night, without fail, she squeaks.<br>  I think you would only have to really worry if he starts sneezing all the time and has a really runny nose.<br>  Just keep an eye on him but I think it will be ok.<br>  :-)|`|I8fAJ1Bdaa	It could be something as simple as allergies, but if your rats are happy, active, eating normally, and reasonably clean, then all you need to give them is love. The stress of constant checkups, and your worried energies are probably worse for them than a sneezing problem. You need to avoid the sheltering mother attitude, and let them enjoy themselves without you worrying too much.|`|pdPX1Pt6aa	you shouldn't worry about these things so much im sure every thing will be just fine.|`|x2ON6FAzaa	3 month old rat! i had a rat and i got it when it was 1 month old because its supost to die when its three months!|`|qfWYfHUCaa	If he's not flopping about doing the funky chicken and his eyes and ears are clean and clear and he has energy, he's eating and he seems like a happy rat then stop panicking.   It is possible... I'm just putting it out there mind you.. these little guys are very bright...that if when he grunts and sneezes you lavish lots of love and attention on him he may start grunting and sneezing to get more loving.  It sounds like you are a very attentive owner and that's good but you have to enjoy them too.  I've found the best way to get over obsessing about one rat is to get lots of rats!!!!!

GksOStrsaa	Doing hunters is so great. It's such a rewarding discipline. Of course, thats all i've ever done... Anyways, equitation classes are judged basically 75% on the rider and 25% on the horse. Hunter classes, on the other hand, are the other way around.(Pleasure, medals) Maybe I'm biased, but i think there really aren't many bad things about hunters. I especially love medals classes because the courses are soo fun!!! I hope you decide to switch over and i hope i see you at some shows!!!|`|0DhFhzDGaa	Ok so Hunter/jumper has divisions.<br>  <br>  Starting very low with walk trot(I don't consider that or leadline divsions,but some do)<br>  crossrails<br>  short/long stirrup- 2'0(short stirrup is 13 & under, long- 14 & older)<br>  green rider-2'3 <br>  low childrens- 2'6<br>  childrens- 2'9<br>  and several more divisions<br>  <br>  any wayz each divisions have these classes:<br>   hunters( jumping)<br>   Equitation over fences<br>   hunter undersaddle (flat)<br>   Equitation on the flat<br>  some have 2 hunter classes and the eq over fences is instead a medal class( all medals are equitation classes)<br>  <br>  Hunters is juged on the horse and eq is judged well obviously on the rider.<br>  <br>  <br>  So the difference in eventers and hunter/jumpers is in eventers there is crosscountry, stadium, and dressage<br>   the stadium is just a jumpers class. <br>  In hunter/jumpers there are jumpers and hunters.<br>  <br>   BTW jumpers don't have flat classes- they are all over fences.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!!

ak9DrBSwaa	Know what type of hamster you are getting. If it's the large/normal size (ie not a dwarf type) it is properly called a Syrian or Golden hamster.<br>  <br>  Teddy Bear is a gimmicky nickname for the long haired variety of Syrian hamster. Oet stores use these names so they can charge you more.<br>  <br>  It's important to know which species you have, so you can look up ways to correctly care for it. Not all species have the same needs and whats good for one type, may be harmful for another.<br>  <br>  On naming - sometimes it helps to get it home and then decide.

That is really odd.|`|w2JnfhNiaa	ok this happened to my cat. when she had babies. i tried to move her because she had the kittens under my bed. so take her and put her in a room with you. make sure she cant leave  or hide. then hold her and pet her. hopefully she will get used to it.
kfmR3pb9aa	ok first thing first. <br>  <br>  a cage is the most important thing. if you are getting a baby then make sure that the bars on the cage are not more than about one inch by one inch or they will get out. the cage cannot be a completely closed in thing such as a fish tank. chinchillas will over heat. you can get either a wire, or solid bottom cage. this is pretty much your decision, although i suggest a solid bottom to make it easier on their feet. PLEASE no plastic in the cage ANYWHERE.<br>  <br>  a wheel is not a necessity but i would suggest it. either a large (over 15 inches) solid wheel, or a flying saucer which i prefer, will work. these are expensive, but don't just settle for a 15 dollar wire or plastic one. these can kill your chinchilla.<br>  <br>  anything wood in the cage should only be made of safe wood with no paints or glues. not all wood is safe, so make sure you check to see that the wood is on a chinchilla safe list. i know off-hand that kiln dried pine is safe but not pine thats not kiln dried. wood is important to help them trim their teeth that grow constantly.<br>  <br>  dust bath is a must and the brands don't really matter as long as it isn't scented. as long as it doesn't have any additional scents or colors or anything it should be safe. i use kaytee i think.<br>  <br>  it is crucial to have a good brand of food. i use mazuri which isn't that expensive, and i've heard that oxbow is good also. if you cannot get those brands it's ok as long as the food doesn't have anything other than pellets in it. little treats in the food will discourage the eating of the pellets. try a get an alfafa based pellet to ballance with the timothy hay.<br>  <br>  timothy hay is also a must. any brand is ok as long as the hay isn't moldy, or hasn't gotten wet. if the hay smells sweet than it's probably ok. if it smells musty or moldy than throw in out.<br>  <br>  you can put fleece it there cage or ever use it for bedding in a solid bottom cage. it's safe for them to chew because they cannot get a bite off or choke on it. if you don't use fleece for bedding than kiln dried pine, or aspen are safe to use. DO NOT use cedar, not kiln dried pine, or corn cob bedding or it can, and most likely will kill your chinchilla.<br>  <br>  and of course a water bottle that should be cleaned every day or every other day. <br>  <br>  theres are the essentials. <br>  <br>  DO NOT get your chinchilla a running ball or they could overheat, pee in it, etc. no plastic, no un-safe woods, and not to many treats.<br>  <br>  theres probably more but that's what came to mind...haha sorry about the book.|`|2Go0Y0xnaa	I'm not going to get into a long-winded answer for you, I'm simply going to direct you to a forum where you can get the answers you need, given by many, many chinchilla owners and breeders:  <a href="http://www.chins-n-hedgies.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.chins-n-hedgies.com.</a>  Pretty much any question can be answered there.  You can also see plenty of cage pictures, chin pictures, hammocks, etc.  <br>  <br>  Also, for others reading this, I want to point out that just because food doesn't have treats in it, does not make it okay to feed.  If you can't find it locally, then order it online from a reliable source with good feed.  The ONLY food I would buy from a pet store is either Mazuri or Oxbow, and of the two, Oxbow would be my first choice.  However, you will often find that even with shipping, it's cheaper to buy a priority box full of feed than to buy it in a pet store.  It's about the only way you can get the best dust as well, which is Blue Cloud.  Anything from a petstore is substandard to that.  Don't buy treats from the pet store, don't buy food, and be VERY careful of wood from there.  Almost all pet stores carry peach wood and claim it's safe.  It is not.  It is toxic to chinchillas.  On the link I gave above, you will find an FAQ that relates what are considered to be chin safe wood.<br>  <br>  Congrats on your new addition!|`|XrMMH5tZaa	know that a chinchilla is a long time investment<br>  they can live up to 20 years<br>  so please take care of it and dont give it up cause u get bored of it<br>  not saying u wont but ya<br>  i hope u enjoy him/her
juyA6HUJaa	I'm no expert but I think its 4 weeks they are sexually mature so probably couldnt get anything pregnant yet and I also think 2.5 weeks is way to early to be away from the mother, do you even know if it can eat yet? the minimum is 4 weeks but breeders usually leave it 6 to 8 weeks|`|4b5106290d0dd7b8527192088f2ec6b6aa	Two & one-half weeks is a bit early, but not dreadfully early to take the pups away from the mum. They wean at about 3 weeks and should be eating quite well on their own right now.<br>  <br>  Male pups are sexually mature at 21 days (3 weeks) and female pups at 28 days (4 weeks).<br>  <br>  You can tell the sex of the pups with ease if they are over 2 weeks old. The following link provides some good sexing photos. Maybe that will help:<br>  <a href="http://www.cavyspirit.com/sexing.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cavyspirit.com/sexing.htm</a><br>  <br>  Not all mounting is sexual. Some mounting behaviour is dominance related. Your best bet is to determine the sexes of the pups and separate them accordingly.|`|aiIS83Onaa	I've heard of boars breeding to their mothers when they are as young as three weeks old. and you can usually sex them right at birth...<br>  but you shouldn't sell them when they are only 2 and a half weeks old unless they seem ready to go, and if you aren't very experienced about knowing that then it's better to wait. <br>  this is my method of sexing guinea pigs (gets easier with practice), male's "privates" have an "i" shape, while females have a "Y" shape. <br>  the females are probably just acting up because they are in heat. it's kind of sort of a dominance thing.

A reticulated python was caught by villagers in Indonesia or somewhere and they claimed it was 49, but when measured by scientists, it was only 25 foot.<br>  <br>  Ball pythons normally get 4 feet, but females can get 5 or 6 feet.<br>  <br>  Reticulated pythons are the longest snakes in the world, with the record being 33 feet, not 49. Anything over 24 feet is rare.<br>  <br>  Burmese pythons average 16 to 18 feet for females, and 10 to 14 for males. They have been known to get up to 25 feet, but anything over 18 is incredibly rare.<br>  <br>  jboy also mentions carpet pythons grow to 5 or 6 feet, but again, he is incorrect. There are different subspecies with different lengths. Jungle carpet pythons grow 5 1/2 to 7 feet, Irian Jaya carpet pythons grow 4 to 5 feet, and coastal carpet pythons grow 8 to 10 feet easily.<br>  <br>  There are dozens of other species of pythons, but the three I've named are common.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	There are many species of pythons in the pet trade. The most common are the ball python and the burmese python. Ball pythons tap out at about 4ft with females getting slightly larger between 5ft-6ft. Burmese pythons are considered giant snakes. They can max-out between 12-15ft. in captivity with some wild specimens pushing 18ft. Reticulated pythons do appear in the pet trade and are also considered giant snakes. The largest recorded retic was 32-33 ft. African rock pythons, Amethystine pythons and Indian rock pythons are also some other giant pythons. Children's and spotted pythons appear in the pet trade. These are small pythons averaging between 3-4ft. The blood python can grow to a little over 5ft. Their thick heavy bodies make them appear larger.|`|xSdnsSojaa	Others have already answered the question of size, so I won't address that (except to say that Swan Song's 37.5 foot anaconda was never officially confirmed), but I feel it should be mentioned that if you're an inexperienced keeper, you should avoid the large pythons such as the Burmese, Reticulated and African Rock. These species can be dangerous when full grown, and amateur keepers have been killed by them. They are definitely *not* for the inexperienced.|`|aDBQncYuaa	Reticulated pythons will get upwards of 30-33 feet (not 49. The longest snake ever recorded was a green anaconda discovered in 1944 by a geologist, and it measured 37.5 feet)<br>  <br>  Burmese pythons top out at about 18-22 feet<br>  Ball pythons grow to about 4-6 feet<br>  Rock pythons grow to 30-32 feet<br>  Green tree pythons will reach roughly 7 feet<br>  Carpet pythons will grow to about 10 feet

426c98c5e6499e1f282c417b905cea60aa	It would definitely be more painful and possibly make the situation worse.  I would refer people to their vet first to get the problem under control before I would pluck the fur, what's the point in plucking the fur - it's not going to make the ear any better without vet intervention.  It only works as a preventative measure to improve air flow in the ear and avoid ear infections before they start.|`|DhE0rEWiaa	Removing the hair from the dogs ears just makes it easier for the ear to breath, the hair in the ear just traps moisture thus keeping the ear moist and making the infection worse, if the dog has an ear infection the hair needs to come out and the ear needs to be cleaned, removing the hair in the ear dose not make the infection worse it will however help the ear infection to heal. Sorry your not right.|`|sQOXjKFNaa	Why does it have to get to the point of causing pain, when all you have to do is keep the animals ears trimmed and groomed. What kid of infection are we talking about? Yeast? Try applying MONSTAT CREAM to yur pets ears!|`|GSf09ALBaa	Pluck the hair.  It helps having that hair out of the way to treat the infection.  You are doing the dog a big favor.  Thank you.|`|3p3otDlXaa	I see you want to be careful and avoid pain, but plucking ear hair if done right, is pretty important honestly.|`|Fzvfa6bxaa	I both agree and disagree.  The hair does need to come out, but this has crossed over from being a grooming issue to a medical issue.  <br>  <br>  I am very happy to see groomers who are thorough about ear plucking.  However, I would much rather have a groomer refer their client to their vet for ear treatment, than to pluck the hair themselves, and have the owner never take their pet to the vet.  <br>  <br>  Thank you for caring!  And, don't let your boss pressure you to do something to any pet that you feel is beyond a standard grooming issue.|`|oyCq6oG0aa	I am a Vet Tech and that is part of my job. We see all kinds of animals that groomers don't touch the ears when infected, guess what we do ....we pluck them, then clean and dry and apply ear meds. If you pluck and clean them besure to tell the clients that the dog has an infection and needs to be seen by the Vet.|`|Dkb2ZR3Daa	Actually in the clinic I work at we do pluck hair from infected ears(we have a groomer in clinic that does as well)... It traps the moisture in and it's a ground pool for infection. Plucking the ears makes treating the them 10x easier and the chances are improved of fully getting rid of the infection.<br>  Plus it makes the vet/techs job easier to clean, and if people are paying for a service they should receive it, grooming can be costly.<br>  It's great to refer people to the vet-so they can get treatment, but I would pluck the ears infected or not.<br>  Not everyone does everything the same way too, but I like your new bosses view.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	It depends on whether the dog is being treated for ear infection or not.  If they are being treated by a vet, then I plucked the hair out. It makes it easier for owners to treat & clean & being able to see inside of the ears.  If they haven't or don't know that the dog has an infection then I leave it for vet to test & remove if they want.  You shouldn't be getting many dogs with ear infections & be certain you are cleaning hemostats between dogs esp. ones with infected ears.
geeSX6HHaa	It could mean tons of things.  Not all are necessarily bad.  Most bones in the hock don't fuse.  If it is not fusing, it is probably not supposed to be fused.  Or if the horse has already started fusing the bones then just stopped, he may just be growing slowly and need another growthspert.  Or the worst case scenario: he may have arthritis.  I would get a vet to check.  The first two do not need treating or if he has arthritis, he may need some kind of treatment but it shouldn't be too expensive.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	I'm posting an article on bone spavin (probably what your horse has) which gives some information on the development and treatments.  When the hock fuses, the horse hopefully becomes sound as a result.  If the fusion is not progressing as expected, the vet should determine why that is, and may be able to provide treatment to enhance the process.  Here is the article....I hope it helps.......<br>  <br>  <a href="http://evrp.lsu.edu/healthtips/bone_spavin.htm" rel="nofollow">http://evrp.lsu.edu/healthtips/bone_spav...</a><br>  <br>  In the article, the term ankylosis is used to mean the body process of fusing (immobilizing) a joint, and the term arthrodesis refers to surgical, chemical, and laser procedures to immobilize a joint ( joint fixations).|`|oQmL4IdWaa	I am not sure what your question is.  Typically, hocks don't fuse unless a horse has some serious arthritis going on.  This usually happens to older horses and it can be quite painful, but once it is finished, the horse can become sound again, but will move slightly stiff behind due to the loss of mobility.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, hocks can be chemically induced to fuse.<br>  <br>  Seems like xrays would be the only way to know how if the hocks were fusing at all, so your vet would be the best one to explain to you what is going on and what the prognoses and treatment options are,
LFeEoHj3aa	Are her nipples pinker, and more round. You can tell when she's pregnant, there are no ways around it. Her nipples around 3-4 weeks will become very pink and round. The hair around them will also recede because she will lick them to get the hair off them so the kittens can drink. GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR NEW KITTENS IF SHE IS PREGNANT! Kittens are so fun to play with. And if someone by the name of Percy and Penny yells at you because your cat is pregnant ( she yelled at me because mine was) Don't mind her. Just tell her to shut her mouth and go away. Hope I helped! GOOD LUCK!|`|sa5bBAdsaa	probably|`|5kjYFb9Taa	Cats dont usually show any signs of being prego! If her tummy is hard/stiff, she is. && if shes an outside cat, I can almost guarantee she is indeed prego.|`|X6PDtlq4aa	Why isn't your cat fixed?? The belly looks like a round ball when a cat is pregnant, you should keep her in as she still can be impregnated again by another male. Spaying and neutering is very important in order to minimize unwanted pets. You're doing her a huge favor by bringing her to the vet for neutering!!! Please consider it after the birth!|`|XTlJROHdaa	Being pregnant does not stop cats from wanting to go outside.  She might even want to go out so she can have the kittens out there.  Make sure you get her spayed, and then you won't have to worry about it anymore.
KToEYmwWaa	Congrats on your new rats, I have two girls myself and they are the loves of my life :)  It sound like you are doing everything right.  With the fighting remember one thing, no blood no foul.  Rats are unbelievably hardy and they are most likely establishing dominance anyway.  Your friend is right, the nibbling is just checking think out and testing their boundaries. <br>  <br>  If they don't want to be picked up yet, then leave them be.  It wont be long before they get to know you and beg to be picked up and played with.  They just need to trust you first. <br>  <br>  Also, I don't think the cage being higher up is an issue.  My girls cage is on a coffee table next to my bed so that they can play on the bed when they please.  Just make sure the cage is on a stable, large surface.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your girls!|`|IFGSOd16aa	The nibbiling thing is actually good!<br>  It means they like you :) Yay<br>  <br>  I have 2 males and they play fight and then sleep together. <br>  (sometimes you just need so fun :). so its normal)<br>  <br>  Never to much on the cleaning.<br>  They are extremely clean and like to clean 500x a day!<br>  <br>  When they crawl on your hands just pick them up and put them on your shoulder. (wear a hoodie!!) <br>  <br>  They will crawl around and get more and more used to you. (kinda seems like they have if they nibble.)<br>  <br>  Do they lick you too?<br>  because thats also a good sign.<br>  <br>  Ya so just like walk around and play with them. Pet them when they are on your shoulder and say their name so they can get used to there name too. <br>  <br>  (at first only hold one) sometimes they get to much to handle.<br>  <br>  They will prob go down your shirt! happens all the time. It tickles. <br>  <br>  They nibble on me ear which tickles to.<br>  You are not doing anything wrong and it sounds like they are liken you already! Keep up the good work!<br>  <br>  (Feed them yummy treats too!)|`|xLNzdxsOaa	I'm a new rat owner myself, two boys, one younger and one older.<br>  <br>  First, rats are EXTREMELY clean and healthy rats will wash themselves constantly. Perfectly normal, and actually a good thing.<br>  <br>  The nibbling on your fingers is totally normal, my rats nibble and lick me as a grooming thing; it means they consider you part of their family. It may seem a little gross that they're washing you, but it's a compliment.<br>  <br>  The fear of being picked up is probably  because they're fresh out of the pet store and not well socialized. It will get easier, but what helped for me was making sure they knew I was there then scoop them up gently  underneath, making a cup with my hands. They seem way more comfortable when I do that. Make sure you do it slowly; a big mistake is moving to quickly which makes them think you're a predator. Now they ride around on my shoulders, and don't soil themselves anymore.<br>  <br>  As for the height thing, my rats live in a 4 story sky scraper cage we made out of bookshelves (google 'rat grotto cage') and they spend all their time on the fourth floor. And they enjoy riding around on my shoulders and climbing as high as they can, so a cage above the ground should be fine.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you're doing a great job, and doing your research. I just love my rats, they become part of the family really quickly.|`|OrBxTe9aaa	That's all normal when you get new rats to be hyper and them pooping is just them being scared and getting used to things i had to have my rats up on a table thing and so does my friend its fine. They clean themselves a lot especially when you first get them. yes it is normal for them to nibble on you. my rats were hard to take out of there cage at first and they will always squirm when you try to take them out of there cage. Rats will sometimes nibble on each other or fight but if it gets serious like one is bleeding separate them immediately! they should start to be less hyper soon but it will take awhile and the pooping out of there cage a lot will stop once they get used to you just make sure you play with them a lot and make sure the have chew toys and other things to keep them occupied.|`|ZuH73QvWaa	Don' t worry, im sure your doing a great job at caring for your new rats! I wouldn't get so concerned about everything, it can really make you stressed when really there is no reason why to be.<br>  <br>  Yes, rat do clean themselves a lot. They are one of the cleanest animals! If your rat did have any problems, then she would be scratching a lot and there would be scabs all over your her/his body!<br>  <br>  Nibbling on peoples fingers is also another very normal Habit for a rat. My rat (Lilo) used to do it. It's basically just a sign that they are getting used to their surroundings and seem to use there teeth to investigate things. They may also bite, nibble or even lick your fingers if there is food odour left on your skin or if you are/or have been eating food.<br>  <br>  Give your rats time to adjust. Over a couple of days to weeks they will learn to trust you. For now you will just have to handle them daily and in no time you will become best friends! Don't worry, everyone hates the feeling of harming their little babies. Just grab your rat as firmly as you can before it is able to Escape. Another option is by trying to bribe your rat with its favourite food. When your rat obeys you give <br>  him/her the treat.<br>  <br>  Hmmmm. Your rats have obviously not been toilet trained. Only 2 of my rats had not been toilet trained. However, my other three rats were and I never seemed to have experienced any problems which was a relief. Cleaning up your animals pooh can often be quite frustrating!<br>  <br>  To be quite honest with you, I don't think it matters too much if you have your rat's cage on the floor or not. I think it may be probably best to keep it right were it is (of the floor) for the time being, especially as you have a dog. Rat's and dogs bond quite well with eachother (or so I have read!). Maybe you should try and introduce them to eachother. You never know they may end up the best of friends!<br>  <br>  Good luck with your new rats! I hope this helps you.|`|alccyiawaa	hey!<br>  rats are awesome,<br>  <br>  but first thing is first, if your rat/rats are clinging to the door or your cage, dont be afraid to pull them off. dont get tongs and rip them off !! but just put your hand around them and pull, they will let go. <br>  <br>  i used to have a rat and he was massive!<br>  <br>  rats love to nibble and lick your fingers because they can taste/smell different things on you, all rats do that. <br>  <br>  with the whole cage thing, i used to keep mine on a table, but i used to let him out alot and let him walk around every where, so it is really up to you if you want to keep them on the floor or on a desk. but just make sure that the desk that they are on has room around it and is long enough so it wont fall. <br>  <br>  rats poo alot. they will poo everywhere and that is totally normal!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  it sounds like you are looking after them very well!|`|Z9xy3Mwxaa	i had 8 rats and its normal for them to clean themselves all the time they r very clean animals and they love to come out and crawl around you if you really work with them they will open up to u and let u play with them and may even sleep on u|`|f12Uz4bRaa	It's really great that you did all that research but make sure you get them from a good breeder or Humane socity or a rat rescue(but if you don't have any around your place then petsmart is ok :))<br>  Have fun with your rats;D
m16gf9mzaa	Emmalyz had some good ideas there.  But also, what if kitty was just playing?  Cats rough-house with each other, using their claws and teeth - and when they get close to humans, they do not realize that we do not have a nice thick coat of fur to protect us from their sharp points.  <br>  <br>  One thing you can do to help, is to learn how to clip kitty's claws.  Done properly, it will cause the cat's claws to not be so sharp, but without causing any harm to the cat. It would be great to have a veterinarian or vet tech or groomer show you how the first time, but that may not be practical, so here is a link to a video from the Humane Society on how to do that:  <a href="http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/cat_care/how_to_trim_a_cats_claws.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/cat_ca...</a> <br>  <br>  And another idea, is to make sure you don't play with kitty with your bare hands.  There are plenty of interactive toys that you can use to play with the kitten - including some really wacky looking glove thingies that have extended fingers. I have also used an animal-shaped oven mitt to wrassle with my cats, plus there is always the perennial favorite game "mouse under the bed covers" (um... the risk to this one is that having the kitten associate the bed with playtime might encourage him to wake you up in the middle of the night to play more often than he would already, but I do it with my cats because it is so darn cute).<br>  <br>  Sometimes a petting or brushing session suddenly turns into a biting session, or your kitten somehow gets his teeth into you in spite of your precautions while playing. When that happens, try to control your instincts to pull away immediately - that is what a prey animal would do, and it excites the feline more. Instead, you want to push in towards kitten's mouth or body - gently, mind you. So if he's got your finger in his teeth, you will calmly, gently push your finger further into his mouth. The same principle applies to getting out of the kitten's grasp when the claws have sunk into your skin - push in towards kitty's body rather than pulling away.   The goal here is not to punish by sticking your finger down his throat or to hurt in any way, but to surprise the kitten with an action that will cause him to release you. Also, if you can, try to imitate a feline growl - it is one of the ways his mother would have used to correct his behavior when it was not acceptable to her. If you cannot (I know I can't get it right) a firm, calm "No!" will do the trick. Then you back off for a time, and use the social pressure of ignoring the kitten for a while to give the kitten time to calm down and to realize how unacceptable his behavior was.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|1ad7aa5Caa	Cats use their claws and teeth as their defense. Maybe your cat felt trapped or frightened. If you were close enough to be scratched on the nose, you were in the cat's personal space. <br>  <br>  Cats especially hate being stared at or having to make eye contact. It's a huge threat. Maybe you shouldn't stick your face near your cat like that again. <br>  <br>  Can you imagine someone 5 times your size staring into your face? Wouldn't you feel like punching them, too? I'm not saying you did something horrible, but now that you've been advised, if you get scratched on the face again, you know why.|`|LaQUv3ZTaa	umm get them 'fixed' like spaid or neutered and declawed....all three of my cats r like that...when u get them fixed it takes their sex hormones away so there is no going into heat for females and no aggressiveness and competitiveness for males...and when u get them declawed they cant scratch u or the furniture
oDVx7nSxaa	Some cats are just more prone to hairballs then others - try grooming them with a rubber brush called a zoom groom - it honestly takes out more hair than anything I've ever used.  Give that a try, and see what happens.  <br>  <br>  For the grain free dry - mine much prefer Innova's EVO over the Core.  I don't feed much dry here, but the EVO is the favorite.  You might want to see if they'd like that better.  The Wellness pouches?  That's about all my elderly cat will eat.  My seal point loves it also, the others won't touch it.  Some other non-pate foods that are of equal quality that you might want to try are Merrick (it's sort of chunky and comes in lots of flavors), and Weruva (a shredded chicken that's extremely well-liked).|`|K0uTjeWiaa	Hairballs. get something called 'vet basis' or you can get some slippery elm from a health food store.  The dandruff I imagine is from your heating.<br>   Stay away from the garbage foods, I would also prefer that you stayed away from dry food altogether. There are other quality bands besides wellness out there  merrick, wysong for example., There is also the option of a raw food diet that you prepare at home<br>   Best of luck|`|8DCslWmMaa	You can get something that (not sure if it is still called this) Petromalt.<br>  It has lots of nurtiants and will help with hairballs.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you are careful about the food you give but I did not see you mention anything about corn or fish.<br>  Corn is usually what is used to give pet food it's bulk and it is one of the major causes of dandruff in cats and dogs.<br>  Costco has corn free pet foods last time I looked.<br>  Fish is a big no-no for male cats. It is very high in minerals and salts that can block the urinary tract in all cats, but it is more problematic for male cats because the urethra is so narrow.<br>  <br>  Daily brushing of your cats will also help.<br>  Usually throwing up a hairball is really nothing to worry about, it is totally natural thing for cats.<br>  The big cats like lions and such do this all the time, they have to spit up the hair they consumed from their prey.<br>  <br>  As goes the food you have and they won't eat- your cats have trained you. Keep feeding them what you feel is best for them. They will get hungry enough to eat it.<br>  They are just stringing you along until YOU give in and get them something they like better.<br>  <br>  My cat turns her nose up at food that is left in the bowl, I have to dump it back into the bucket and scoop it back out to trick her into thinking it is 'served fresh'.|`|gwhutbkdaa	Why don't U try cooking them a nice meal . My cat had the same problem ,so I went to the vet and he told me that all cats spicily the small Kitties like to eat home made food like chicken  so all U have 2 do is 2 put a little bit of oil in a pan then add cutted up chicken brist and fri it untel it is ready 2 serve . Hope they like it.
tY3hKEFkaa	Dogs can be taught to "leave it" if your dogs are trained in hunting or have high prey drives it wouldn't be smart to bring in a ferret. If you do keep the cage in a room the dogs can't get to. Ferrets need atleast 3-4 hours a day out of their cage. Also if you have dogs CDV (canine distemper virus) vaccinations are a must. Dogs can shed it off of them even if they don't have it, and you can bring it in the house on the dogs, or you. CDV is 100% fatal to  ferrets. They will need CDV shots to be around dogs. WEll the need them in general. Also they need a lot of work. Do a ton of research before getting on. In my area I see too many re-homed on craigslist. They usually aren't socialized and I fostered two that were severly aggressive and had to go. They need a lot of play time. (not chewing you out just letting you know). And I see tons of ferrets keep cycling through craigslist. Do as much research as you can, and if you get a fuzzy make sure to socailize her/him and give him lots of playtime. I would never NOT own a ferret again. OH and check your local state/county laws. Many places especially the 5 boroughs of new york city, and ALL OF CALIFORNIA are against ferrets. If you want to know more e-mail me from my profile and I'll give you info on them.|`|VmLZFN4Taa	Whatever room the ferret is in just close the door when you are not in there. <br>  <br>  Do that and the dogs cannot get to the ferret and things should work out..I would be more concerned with the terrier around the ferret because it is a terrier's instinct to kill small animals, but if you are careful I am sure it will be fine.|`|fBMSIlSIaa	Most of the time, I would say yes because dogs can get to love ferrets. But since you have a terrier, even if it might be small, they are hunters. And they hunt animals like ferrets. Unless you are there to supervise them 24/7 I'd go against getting a ferret just for its own sake.|`|XSNdj7Meaa	I would advise against the ferret. just my opinion though. Ferrets are fragile compared to a big lab.|`|Vc5SvdkKaa	no you should get a sugar glider they are a lot better pets|`|LMbkHGYiaa	In my experience it all depends on the animals. My friend had a ferret with both a dog and a cat. All three animals coexisted pretty well. My concern for you would not be with the Labrador since that is generally a very calm and non aggressive breed. The terrier however could be a problem. Terriers are breed to hunt and kill small animals, usually underground. They are tenacious and determined. You have probably seen an example of this when the terrier shakes it's toys violently. I would say it is ok, but have another person around for the first few meetings, just in case things go awry.
3p3otDlXaa	that's okay.  you've got a good dog.|`|imKCvvFKaa	does it matter if a dog is a good guard dog? anyway, since it's part shepherd,it has the protective instinct of a shepherd and the goofiness of a boxer. as long as you love him/her is all that matters and gave it a good home<br>  <br>  P.S. any dog can be protective despite the breed|`|COXHifq7aa	its okay ust love your boxerrr at the end of the dog they are all dogs no matter what the breed is  they will love you to pieces whether its a pit bull or a boxer. and that why people get a dog right? companion??? well i hope so and also german boxers, well i dont know about german boxers but i do know boxers are supposed to be realy great gaurd dogs|`|evPrMBfraa	You have an amazing dog.

h4wNRqf9aa	a water change?<br>  <br>  reducing stocking levels, feeding numbers/ammounts, gravel siphioning, fully cycled tank, appropriate size and flow filter...|`|m0e3a3gWaa	Activated Carbon.<br>  Add this to your filtration system.<br>  It absorbs odors and water impurities and any water discoloration.<br>  But there should be no smell to your tank.<br>  This usually indicates a major problem.|`|qEp9fxU9aa	There is no reason for an aquarium to smell unless there are dead fish in there and/or poor aquarium maintenance.  You should be changing at least 50% of your water every other week.  If you aren't doing this then this is where you start.  This will take some time for you to catch up.  I don't know what size aquarium you have or how many fish though take a look at this and make sure you aren't overfeeding and aren't overstocked.  Decayed food would smell.  Look to see if there is a small leak in the aquarium or if water is seaping down a cord or filter because this could be causing mold or something near by to remain moist and smell as well.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	What is your set up? If you're doing regular water changes and gravel vacs, make sure your filter is up to the job and working correctly, test your water parameters and make sure those are correct, and ultimately make sure you're not overstocked!
bqrKVBqVaa	I don't know about 5 gallons being to small, (I wouldn't go smaller though).  I think it would be okay if you just had those fish.  My only concern is for the otto.<br>  <br>  I personally used to have 3 dwarf puffers in a 6 gallon eclipse tank.  They are cute little buggers, and peacefully co-existed at first.  But after about 10 days, they turned mean on each other.  I think they were territorial, specially over food.<br>  <br>  One bully emerged from the three, he would hog the food and chase the other two.  So I separated him.  But then one of the remaining two took his place as the bully.  They would bite each others tales, and not let go for several seconds.  They are definitely violent little carnivores, don't let they small size and cuteness fool you.  In the end, I just had to take them back to the store.<br>  <br>  You can go ahead and try it, maybe you'll have better luck than me.  I think your 5 gallon tank might be just big enough.  But you better break up their view with plants or decor.  And make sure they all have hiding places.<br>  <br>  About your otto -- I wouldn't if I were you.  Otto's are gentle vegetarians, and delicate.  I've had them too.  I think your dwarf puffers would tear him up and kill him.  Please don't add the otto.<br>  <br>  Let me know what you decide and how it goes.<br>  - Spheiro71@Yahoo.com|`|8Pr6kCSZaa	I would say no, Otos which I own, should be in at least a 20 gallon tank to be happy, they also prefer to be in groups. Otos are very pick eaters, and in my experience and many others, won't eat anything but brown diatom algae. I at one point, had my otos in a 10 gallon with some tetras, but once I moved my tetras to my 30, the otos went with.. and were MUCH happier. Hope this helps.|`|QV6swGUMaa	i would agree on no as your tank is too small to add anything else at all even too small for 3 dps would get a bigger setup if i were you.good luck|`|JnyPoQLIaa	That would not be the best idea, in fact it's not even a good idea to keep one in five gallon tank.  over-crowding is a serious problem and if you are planning to add more puffers then i would suggest at least a  30 gal. tank that has multiple hiding places.  puffers are territorial so hiding places put all around the tank would be a good way to keep the puffers from attacking one another. however you were on the right track when you said you were going to heavily plant the aquarium.  and as far as "Otos" go, they usually do get along with puffers.<br>  I myself prefer the porcupine puffer.|`|f8RBtCVAaa	ok well dwarf puffers must be kept alone! but the one fish that can get along with it is the pleco. an algea eater fish. but i have never used sand for a alga eater fish. idk how that is going to turn out. but anyway i must say that this is such a cool thing u are doing. yes they can fit in a 5 gallon if its just him and another fish. but realy u dont need any algae eater fish right now cause there are going to starve to death cause there is no algae so  u can buy it early but use algae disks or tablets. they feed off of those.|`|qEp9fxU9aa	No Puffer's should be left by themselves.  Puffers have incredibly strong beaks and like to taste everything.  Eventually they'll take bites out of your Otto as well as fake plants, filters, etc.  They're great fish they just need to be in an aquarium by themselves.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	A 5g with 2 female and 1 male dp is a little overstocked for dps, I would recommend a 10g with that mix rather than a small 5g.<br>  <br>  Read this site. <a href="http://www.dwarfpuffers.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dwarfpuffers.com/</a><br>  <br>  Otos are surprisingly skittish fish, need to be in groups, need live plants, and can damage themselves in small tanks - I personally wouldn't recommend them for any smaller than 15 gallons.|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	Forget having that number of fish in a 5 gallon tank, it's far to small and even if you did daily water changes (which is not recommended as it stresses the fish) the fish would die of ammonia poisoning, the only fish you can keep in a 5 gallon is a Betta fish.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Dwarf puffers require five gallons per fish, and usually6 best kept in a species only tank.<br>  <br>  Otos do best in small groups, require more space than a five gallon allows, and I would not house them together with dwarf puffers.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	otos and cories were the only two fish my DP's did NOT get along with...<br>  <br>  so i can't recommend them|`|eyKx05LKaa	I just looked up this website:  dwarf-puffers.blogspot.com, and it said the following about dwarf puffer tankmates:  <br>  <br>  "Otocinclus - Known as "otos" in the aquarium trade, these little guys are an excellent addition to a dwarf puffer tank. Almost everyone who has tried them has successfully kept them in a dwarf tank with little to no problems. They remain small and do not attract much attention to themselves. They are also algae-eating machines! Learn all about them here. "<br>  <br>  However, it did say 2-3 galllons of water per fish, so I think it would be best to have only 2 puffers and one oto.  I would look up the site, it gives a lot on info on puffers.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  liveaquaria.com states that otis "otocinclus" need at least a 30 gallon tank and should be kept in groups, so that would not work for a 5 gallon tank.
2YIxnXXyaa	It's either shell rot or a fungal disease.<br>  I would suggest calling a vet and seeing if you need to come in or if they can give you some advice over the phone.<br>  <br>  I suggest doing some more research on how to care for them, aquatic turtles need about 400 dollars worth of stuff.  With the filter,<br>  water heater (set to 70-80 degrees),<br>  basking area, it should be about ten degrees warmer than the water, so about 88-90 degrees,<br>  River rock (any smaller rock, your turtle could swallow it and it could end up in death for your turtle)<br>  Some feeder goldfish,<br>  A heater, this keeps your turtle's metabolism up,<br>  Some aquatic plants, but in a place where your turtle can't dig it up (Aquatic turtles are notorious for that)<br>  <br>  <br>  So many things can go wrong with them also, something as small as the water being too cold, the UVB lamp not working, etc.<br>  <br>  It's important to get a well working filter because turtle's are dirty animals, they feces in their water and half their food is made into crumbs that just fall to the bottom of the tank.  The dirtier the water is, the more chance of your turtle getting Salmonella.<br>  Wash your hands thoroughly after holding your turtle.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you don't have a vet or know of any, here's a list of vets who specialize in turtles/tortoises in each state.<br>  <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Info/state_resources.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Info/st...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helped, good luck.|`|JnyPoQLIaa	It sounds like to me that your turtle has a case of shell rot or has a fungal infection.  In both cases this can be fatal if left unchecked.  My advice to you that you should TAKE YOUR TURTLE TO A VET that has experience with reptiles, so as to get the right treatment for your turtle.  <br>  <br>  on a side note, all that you really need to for your aquatic turtles habitat are a few things. these include:<br>  Appropriately sized tank<br>  A light on a timer <br>  Sub-strait (ordinary fish tank gravel works just fine, fill to 1/4 inch deep)<br>  A rock, log, or anything that your turtle can climb up on and bask<br>  A filtration system <br>  Tank heater should only be used if your turtles natural habitat has water warmer than room temperature 75 degrees<br>  And of course turtle food<br>  <br>  if anyone else has information on any items that I have not suggested please add them|`|avaQoSORaa	its a type of fungus so u should keep its water clean and scrub its shell at least once a day|`|11RFLpViaa	If you cant afford to take the turtle to a vet (which is what happened to me when my red eared slider got shell rot) they sell this stuff at pet stores that you can soak him in. Not sure about Florida red bellied, but it worked for my res. You just put him in a bowl or something shallow where he can keep his head above water, add the medicine, put him in there a while, and then rinse him off before you put him back in his tank. I dont know the name of the stuff, but they have it at PetSmart. It's about $10. My res had a small hole in shell when I got him, and also air bubbles under shell. He's doing much better now as he has shed most of the bad sections. I used the soaking medicine also. Good luck!

dM1YXanAaa	They would be beautiful!! I have two british shorthairs. One is a blue colourpoint and the other is a solid lilac. If any of the kittens were colourpoint they would have blue eyes, regardless of the mother being a tortie. If they came out a solid colour like for example a lilac, they would have amber eyes.

QMl4ELhGaa	First, your cat does not have an eating disorder. The other cat is just preventing her from eating. Eve is exerting her dominance over Kiwi. Feed them in separate rooms so you can ensure Kiwi gets her food. Do not allow Eve near Kiwi until Kiwi has eaten her food. Problem solved.|`|4yt4D3vMaa	Feed them in separate rooms with the doors shut.|`|qXH5WiWjaa	Get them separate bowls and feed them in different rooms.  If you find that Eve decides to take the other bowl up as hers as well, start closing the door during meal times for them.  Do they get along in general and only have issues with each other during meals?  I have 4 cats and my youngest cat still does not like the oldest and tries to dominate the food bowl as well.  I had two separate bowls for them (in the same room) and kept it that way for about 6 months before I gave them all a community food bucket.  They still don't quite get along but they don't fight each other when it comes to eating anymore.|`|p7yaM0qiaa	it sounds like eve has taken the dominate role between the two. eventually kiwi will have to stand up to eve and sort it out herself. cruel i know but sometimes that's the only way. my other suggestion is this. make sure each cat has her own bowl and her own separate eating area. get some wet can food and give the major portion to kiwi and the smaller one to eve. this way eve doesn't feel left out of the special treat and there is no cause for added jealousy. u can also get some over the counter vitamins for kiwi. should be able to get this in any pet aisle. this is what has always worked for me. i have 7 cats. i keep the boys outside and my girls inside. my oldest cat didn't like some of the new comers so when i made sure that she had her own bowl and her own spot to eat. she did better. hope this helps you. good luck with kiwi and eve.|`|bru9ZQeIaa	You need to let Eve know you are in charge.

I think you mean 13cm.<br>  <br>  Apparently males will also "have two conspicuous patches of scales on the inner surface of each hind leg"*|`|bf5084d1ec35330c95ff7b7bd883bbffaa	In most all turtles, you will find that the plastron of the male (the underside of the shell) will have a slight depression to it, which makes it easier for the male to "mount" the female's back during mating.<br>  <br>  AlexD is also correct with the additional details, although the smaller the turtle, the more difficult it will be to detect the differences in tail length.

pTmrZicfaa	Do lots of bending work, getting his head down and flexed. Also do some dressage work. Not only will it get his neck nice and bulked up, his body and bum will be nice too! It's also a nice ride because you really have to work and connect mentally and physically with your horse. Even if you only ride for 10 minutes, it's still a nice workout for him.<br>  Also, carrot exercises have helped my guys neck, and it doesn't take a lot of time and I can still do it when he's lame and I can not ride =) <br>  He's been in stall rest for 5 weeks and lost all the muscle in his body/bum we gained since I've had him, but his neck stayed pretty nice =)<br>  The two combined should do a lot.<br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Edit - If he doesn't like to bend or flex, try draw reins. I use them on my guy because he looked like a pigeon and would not put his head down... Once the draw reins were used he relaxed and he lifted his back while he put his head down... Great for the neck, the back, and the bum =)<br>  <br>  If you don't/can't ride and use your body and hands to get him flexed and relaxed, then I would suggest side reins when you lunge. I don't know much about tie downs, but I know side reins make the same type of pressure as a rider does. That way the horse will feel more secure in his flexing because he will feel the same type of pressure when he is being asked to flex with you riding, or when you just lunge. I have heard that it is not a good idea to ride in side reins though...<br>  I've added a site that might help you with your decision should you decide on draw reins and side reins.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.equisearch.com/horses_riding_training/english/dressage/eqreins2640/" rel="nofollow">http://www.equisearch.com/horses_riding_...</a><br>  <br>  By the way, the author says that draw reins are not to "muscle him up", but used correctly they will definitely do that quite well =)|`|OUktzBqlaa	All you have to do is a lot of bending work, such as circles and figure eights. Also a really help way is to make sure you horse has a very tucked in head position. luging and riding with a tie down will help a lot too!|`|ko6A3419aa	Try using a germen martangal or side reins both will work.....but you have to use them everytime u ride except trail rides and jumping because they get in the way|`|LAXxaxAZaa	I guess a tie down could help... but you have to be sure it's not too tight. If it's too tight, he'll fight against it and end up with a neck like this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dkimages.com/discover/previews/833/540391.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.dkimages.com/discover/preview...</a>|`|5QG9Zrjaaa	Personally, I'm not a big fan of the rubber neck stretcher things, but they are a good crutch.  To build topline, which the neck is a part of, you need to teach your horse to come from his hind end, and to have good front to back balance (longitudinal balance) so that he can make his transitions easily and without dropping to his forehand hard.  This isn't a quick fix; it'll take a couple of months or more depending on your horse, and your skill in lunging and riding.<br>  <br>  When I lunge, I work on longitudinal balance. I always use sidereins, and usually a sliding inside rein, where the lunge line goes through the snaffle bit ring and up to the top of the surcingle. This lets me take and give on the inside rein, and affect the balance to the steady outside siderein.<br>  <br>  I use different sized circles, keeping in mind that small circles are much harder both from a point of view of bend and strength.<br>  <br>  To work on the longitudinal balance, after a good 2-5 min walk for warmup, I trot the horse for a circle and half, then walk a quarter of a circle, then back up to trot. When the horse can do these transitions just off voice and body commands without extra steps, they are balanced. Then I move to canter; the horse canters for a circle and a half, trots a quarter circle, then canters again. When the transitions occur without extra steps or obvious inversion of the frame, I know he is balanced, and ready for me to get on and ride!  This usually takes between 7-15 minutes, and I don't lunge for more than 15 minutes ever.  <br>  <br>  It's also fun (at least my horses seem to think it is) to do canter/walk and walk/canter transitions.<br>  <br>  Transitions are what build strength for the horse, so more transitions, the more strengthening for the horse with the fewest steps. My horses all lunge well and happily; they don't just grind around in circles without change of what is happening. They seem to like to have to listen to my frequent verbal commands
1jPtZcgsaa	if it's low in nitrite and nitrate don't use it. It needs to be clear of those two completely because each time you do a water change your just going to be adding it back into the tank and your tank will never be cycled. Test your tap water for the ammonia, nitrite, nitrate and if it is clean use that. Just make sure you use a water conditioner|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	That depends on your tap water. You can rid it of dissolved gasses, such as chlorine, by allowing it to sit in an open container overnight.The only other thing that you might have to worry about is the pH. As a rules, the East (U.S.) has slightly acid water. The West has alkaline water. Bottled water? Who knows?<br>  <br>  There may be other things in the water. If you are on well water, you may have to have the water tested, if you are worried. If not, your water supplier can tell you what is in the water they send out. Ask for their CCR (Consumer Confidence Report).<br>  <br>  The chances are that your fish will be fine and that you will save money by making the switch.|`|F8m1VaoYaa	tap water is fine just add a water conditioner,im lucky as we have good water where i come from.|`|dJs2s9pfaa	Before you go and rush out and use nothing but bottled water, please note that most bottled water is not suitable for fish when used 100% (it can be mixed or reconstituted). Drinking Water in particular is generally RO water with some minerals added for “taste” (Spring Water is generally fine if it is true spring water). <br>  <br>  Not that there is anything wrong with RO or DI water, it is just they are devoid of VERY important electrolytes and trace elements needed for proper fish respiration and osmotic function, without which you may be worse off in. I use tap water and I just either use water conditoner (if I'm in a hurry) or leave out the replacement water in a large bucket overnight as the chlorine,chloramine all get evaporated out over 24 hours. <br>  <br>  I know some people get a RO filter in their homes to put in their tanks. You may want to research that as an alternative but it is still costly.|`|AA11385753	Tap water is safe as long as you use a treatment to remove the harmful chemicals that are possibly in it.  I use treated tapwater for all of my aquariums...the only exception being those that contain coral.|`|AA10326471	I just use tap water as well, but I believe it's very important to use a water conditioner to neutralize chlorine and heavy metals.
YzoLa5Uuaa	EDIT: I just noticed you posted this question twice, which, I only realized after I thought it just did not post my answer. Sorry for same answer twice. Best of luck.<br>  <br>  Minimum tanks size for the fish:<br>  <br>  Clownfish: 30 gallons<br>  <br>  Damsels: 20 gallons<br>  <br>  Yellow Tang: 55 gallons<br>  <br>  Basically the Tang is nearly out of the question. If you were to try and put 6 fish, plus the anemones and starfish in a single 30 gallon tank you are asking for major trouble. Fish are not meant to be kept in tiny tanks and need room to move around and to survive without completely polluting the water. So put 'em all in, only if you want to create death row (tank) :)<br>  <br>  I would highly suggest going to a good, local fish store near you that caries those types of fish to get a better estimate of what you CAN keep in a tank that size (e. g.: NOT Wal-Mart, Petstop, or any other chain store that might happen to have fish)<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|BJGudd52aa	Damsels aren't a fish you can really put together, and especially with Clownfish. The problem is they're very aggressive to all they cohabitate with, especially when you bring an Anemone into the question. As for the starfish, that all depends on the type - though things like your Lankia Starfish need a much larger tank than 30g, roughly twice to three times that size actually. Same goes for the Yellow Tang, it is simply too big for a tank that size and will fight with the Damsels to no end. As for the Anemones, that really depends on the water quality and lighting, not to mention species.<br>  <br>  <br>  Overall, I'd keep the Clownfish idea for now, and ditch the rest - look at things like Chromis or smaller Wrasses for now, and later consider a Blenny or something similar.
0YzP6iOTaa	it's 60-63 days|`|UKpNiRf6aa	Gestation varies somewhat from cat to cat and from breed to breed.  Feline pregnancy lasts from sixty-three to sixty-nine days, although Siamese cats typically carry their babies for seventy-one days.<br>  <br>  Two to three weeks following conception, the first signs of pregnancy appear when the cat's nipples swell and change from light to rosy pink.  Between day seventeen and twenty-five, a vet can detect individual kittens by feeling the pregnant cat's abdomen.
KToEYmwWaa	I recently introduced a new 2 month old rat to my 5 month old female rat.  They are BFF's now but it was a pretty awful first couple weeks they were together.  Just be prepared for fighting, there is no way around it.  Your rat will feel that her space is being invaded.  Once the fighting stops, the new rat will still be bullied for a week or so.  But, after the older rat makes it very clear that she is in charge, they will be inseparable.  I think you should get another rat because rats really need same species companions.  Just make sure you research quarantine and intro procedures and follow all the steps.<br>  <br>  I used to think my girls would never get along, then one day I found them cuddling in the corner or their cage and all the hard work was worth it.|`|BWez86Ldaa	Intros are fairly simple. We started out with 3 rats which came to us as a trio, to the 3 we added one then three more, then one more then our last one, Dabney. We have gone through intros like nothing else! Check out some threads on Goosemoose for some intro advice.<br>  <br>  How we do intros:<br>  <br>  Get together a rattie buffet on a paper plate, put it in your bathtub. Take all the rats to your bathroom and give each a bath in the sink before placing him/her in the tub, do this with all the ratties. Once they are all in the tub, just monitor them. They should do fine and focus more on the food and groomer than the other's presence at first. Good luck!|`|LxAuBSjQaa	My rat lived alone for a year before I introduced her to her first cage mate, they're so social it's rarely a problem with females, males have a bit more trouble.  I'd get a rat that's a few months old, not a baby, since the first day or so may have a few scuffles.  I've found the easiest way to introduce rats its to dab something strong smelling and tasty on both their foreheads like vanilla.  Rats judge who does and doesn't belong based on smell, the vanilla is usually overpowering enough that they're less hesitant to get to know each other.<br>  <br>  Introduce them on neutral ground, like your bed or the floor, not in the cage.  So there's no territory defending.  If your cage can be easily separated, to where they can still see each other, I'd do that when you're not around for a day or two, so they're only physically interacting while supervised.<br>  <br>  They may wrestle around and squeak a lot at first, they're just establishing dominance, it's not a big deal unless they draw blood.<br>  <br>  As long as they're slowly introduced it's rarely ever a problem.<br>  <br>  Shelter rats are an excellent edition to the family and are usually much more socialized than pet store rats, not to mention you're always saving a life when you rescue a rat from the humane society!
PM23RDycaa	No a snail cannot cause parvo.|`|QEaoW8nUaa	My dogs eat snails all the time, you have nothing to worry about.|`|UDAWwyk8aa	If the snail ran over some infected poop maybe. Parvo is usually caught when a puppy steps in infected poop and licks his paws, eats grass where infected poop was or eats the poop. Has there been an outbreak in you neighborhood? Do other dogs that may be sick hang around your dogs? If not you probably dont have anything to worry about.
Ik6WOcw3aa	Barbs are schooling fish and should be in schools of at least 6. When not kept in schools, they tend to be scared, and they often nip fins more often. Just because the barb isnt doing it not, doesnt mean its never going to do it again.|`|a7IHVTNZaa	Barbs are notorious nippers. This one is doing good for now but as they grow up and the tank gets smaller, there might be more aggressive contact. <br>  Don't think that the gourami won't nip either, they can.|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	They will become a problem for sure if you don't keep themt in a shoal of 6 or more. They are nippers and get to be 3" so is your gourami is a dwarf he might get picked on but other gouramis like the 3 spot or opaline get of be 6 " and are semi aggressive and could handle the barbs. When kept in a proper shoal they will not be too bad.|`|SA5DeRpUaa	gouramis aren't that delicate and their intelligence will help it figure out a way to avoid the barb. <br>  it should work out fine.
CmdipyAcaa	It's spring... do NOT transport them in the same box otherwise you might end up with a gravid female, and she is much too small to be able to handle making eggs well. If you have them in the same viv, separate them please before you lose your girl to egg-binding.<br>  <br>  As to heat... they'll be find for a few hours without an extra heat source. If the ambient temperature is above 70 degrees F they will be okay for a bit.|`|EDOxXdcoaa	70°C??  That would make it 158°F.. That would certainly be a fire hazard. <br>  <br>  Honestly, if they're only going to be there for a matter of hours they will be fine at room temperature. If you're worried about it, take along a heating pad (the human variety) and put it on the Low setting under one end of the plastic box.<br>  <br>  **Edit to add**<br>  shiariryu is entirely correct. I guess it didn't occur to me that you were talking about two snakes and only one enclosure! The female is definitely not large enough to be bred yet. The rule of thumb with breeding corns is "3-3-3". Your female needs to be at least 300 grams, she needs to be at least 3 feet, and needs to be at least 3 years of age.
2CbfO4jWaa	well where are the details?|`|BcLEYIwWaa	call a vet and ask for advice|`|wd5zHEq7aa	Depends how long it has been going on for, could be shedding, my chinese water dragons become quiet when they are shedding. If he is going to the toilet then give him time and increase the humidity. Lizards have the ability to perserve energy when they do not eat which makes them quiet. p.s don't leave it to long|`|tiBXaoRPaa	The vet would be your best bet
ur5wDhkMaa	Obviously fish aren't designed for overland travel, but the smaller the fish the less stress it will feel being bagged.<br>  <br>  How big your tank is decides the number and size of fish you can physically keep; it also decides the amount of effort involved in moving them. How long they will be travelling is also an important factor.<br>  <br>  Betta would be the popular choice and they travel best in a bucket /jar or similar walled container rather than a bag.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest African Dwarf Frogs as the easiest option. Strictly not fish, but they are aquatic, small and good travellers. A bit more unusual aswell|`|rKuDDohDaa	A Swordtail is pretty hardy, it could survive loads of bumps and it settles easily into new environments.<br>  <br>  PS<br>  <br>  PLEASE dont buy a betta, it will suffer and get so stressed out it will end up attacking itself and ripping all its beautiful fins apart!<br>  <br>  DONT get a goldfish either! they need such huge tanks and poop A LOT|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Siamese fighting fish, they are beautiful warriors. They need to be in at least a 2.5 gallon with a heater and sponge filter. When traveling, you can keep it in the cup that you bought it in, they can breath air like you and I so an airstone isn't needed.|`|7tJNspGNaa	Fish don't really handle stress that well; so if you're looking for a traveling pet - I definately wouldn't reccomend a fish.|`|M6cP2eJyaa	The only fish that I could think of would be a betta.

If the cats want to go outside, then let them! what's so great about keeping them inside all the time? sure it's healthier, but my cats are more happier if they get to go outside.|`|LFeEoHj3aa	Haha, did you accidentally give them catnip as a toy? Maybe the catnip is making them go crazy, it always makes mine!<br>  <br>  PS: Having indoor cats isn't always responsible. They are perfectly capable of staying outdoors if they want too!
2YIxnXXyaa	Absolutely.<br>  The heat keeps their metabolism up.  Without it, they'll lose their appetite, like in the winter (In Arizona) they don't eat as much because it's colder.  The heat lamp keeps them eating and healthy.  And without one, they could end up getting a sickness.<br>  <br>  They need a basking area to give them vitamins that the sun lets out.  It needs to be about ten degrees warmer than their water, so about 88-90 degrees.<br>  Without this, your turtle could grow ill, and it could actually lead to death due to improper care.<br>  <br>  Go to your local pet store and ask for the best one for your turtle.  Both a heat lamp and a UVB light.|`|ld2vmypNaa	Did you know that they need to bask under a reptile light UVA/UVB for up to 8/ 10 hrs a day for the vitamin D that they need to grow?<br>  <br>  They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones. Drop 20 or 30 or so feeder guppies or small goldfish or minnows they maybe a bit fast for babies at first just drop in the tank and watch them disappear in a few days! <br>  <br>  Vitamins are so important for them to grow.<br>  <br>  They can have garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them in the pond, also meal worms, snails, crickets, flies, crayfish small frogs, slugs, tadpoles ,dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.<br>  They need leafy greens Romaine, Butter lettuce. (Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them, any other leafy greens will do) for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week.<br>  They love grapes and strawberries and squash , apples.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N03/sets/72157612827773738/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...</a>|`|EDOxXdcoaa	All reptiles need a source of heat in order to maintain a healthy metabolism.

zqVDJxUIaa	Isolating the sick fish would not help much, because the infection may already be present in the water. your fish does indeed have Columnaris, often called 'Cottonmouth', Cotton-wool,etc.<br>  <br>  Often mistaken for a fungal infection because of its mold-like lesions, Columnaris is a common bacterial infection in cultured fish, particularly livebearing fish and catfish. Its name is derived from columnar shaped bacteria, which are present in virtually all aquarium environments.<br>  The bacteria are most likely to infect fish that have been stressed by such conditions as poor water quality, inadequate diet, or handling and shipping. Columnaris can enter the fish through the gills, mouth, or via small wounds on the skin. The disease is highly contagious and may be spread through contaminated nets, specimen containers, and even food.<br>  Columnaris can be external or internal and may follow a chronic or acute course. Lesions in chronic cases progress slowly, taking many days before culminating in fish death. In acute cases the lesions spread quickly, often wiping out entire populations of fish within hours. High water temperatures accelerate the progression of the disease; however lowering the water temp will not affect the outcome of the disease.<br>  Symptoms: <br>  -White spots on mouth, edges of scales, and fins<br>  - Cottony growth that eats away at the mouth<br>  -Fins disintegrate beginning at the edges<br>  - 'Saddleback' lesion near the dorsal fin<br>  - Fungus often invades the affected skin<br>  -Rapid gilling in cases where gills are infected<br>  Most Columnaris infections are external, and present first as white or grayish white spots on the head, and around the fins or gills. The lesions may first be seen only as a paler area that lacks the normal shiny appearance. As the lesion progresses it may become yellowish or brownish in color and the area around it may be tinged red.<br>  <br>  Lesions on the back often extend down the sides, giving the appearance of a saddle. On the mouth the lesions may look moldy or cottony, and the mouth will become eaten away. Fins will erode and have a frayed appearance as the infection progresses. The gills filaments will disintegrate as the bacteria invade them, and the fish will begin breathing rapidly due to lack of oxygen. Less commonly, the infection will be internal, and display no external symptoms.<br>   Treatment:<br>  - Change water<br>  - Vacuum gravel<br>  - Add aquarium salt <br>  - Treat with copper sulfate or antibiotic<br>  -Discontinue carbon filtration during treatment<br>  External infections should be treated with antibiotics or chemicals in the water. Copper sulfate, Acriflavine, Furan, and Terramycin may all be used externally to treat Columnaris. Terramycin has proven to be quite effective both as a bath, and when used to treat foods for internal infections. Salt may be added to the water to enhance gill function. Livebearers in particular will benefit from the addition of salt, however use caution when treating catfish, as many are sensitive to salt.<br>  <br>  Remember to continue doing those water changes every day, about 10-20%. Remove any carbon from the filter, this is essential. Remember to follow the instructions on the meds.<br>  Good Luck!
hIyjdXr9aa	The first melano betta strain was started when eggs were exposed to X-rays.  This mutated the genetic information in the eggs, and the fish that hatched were black colored.  These bettas are called "melano" and are infertile.  After many years of very smart breeding, people have managed to breed a black betta that is not sterile, but I'll never forget the case of First Generation black bettas caused by X ray exposure.  <br>  <br>  To answer your question, you have to call the airport ahead of time and ask them their policy for transporting fish.  Each airport has a different policy, so call the one you're flying out from and the one you're landing in, and any airports you may stop at in between.  Usually they have a set procedure for what to do with fish.  <br>  Make sure your fish don't get X-rayed if they're still in egg form.  Fully grown fish will be fine.|`|qEp9fxU9aa	Call the airline ahead of time.  The x-ray won't hurt your fish though they may not allow them on board.  This varies per airline.

It's been a year and 2 months and I still miss her and think about her everyday. What really helped me was getting two more cats.

My hubby finally took me to the shelter and we each pick one new additions to the family. They will never replace her but my house felt full again and they are young and play full have brought joy in to my life. I buried her in the back yard and bough her a bird bath for a head stone and planted flowers for her. When I really miss her I go out there and sit with her for a while.

ytGdMcQsaa	They will not inter breed. Platy's and guppies are live bearers which means that they will give birth to live fish. I do not know about breeding a red finned shark|`|tYmqg6rgaa	yes Platys are live breeders, but i woundntrecommendd putting red fined sharks in the same tank as the other fish as it will try and kill them!
x8Vgu6acaa	This sounds like a case for Judge Judy.<br>  You are responsible for all damages done while in the home.<br>  However,  Someone is going to have to prove their case.<br>  <br>  Landlord:  must prove the carpet was damaged, He has to prove there are spots and/or smell.<br>  You.  Must prove that the carpet was 7 years old when you moved in. And/or that there is not smell or stain.  <br>  <br>  Even if he wins he is only entitled to the value of a 9 year old carpet.  Not a brand new one.|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	If the carpets are completely odour and stain free then how would the landlord even know if your dog peed once, twice or a hundred times?  Something doesn't make sense here.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	If the landlord feels that you damaged the carpet beyond normal wear and tear, then yes, they can ask you to pay. <br>  Did you do an inspection and write down everything wrong with the property before you moved in? If not, and they can prove the carpet was damaged after you moved in, then you would be responsible. Take pictures of the carpet in that room right now, you may need them if the landlord decides to pursue getting the money from you. For now, I'd talk to the landlord and try to reason with him.....but technically, a landlord can come after you for anything that they feel you damaged.....that doesn't mean they'd win, but they can come after you.|`|GSf09ALBaa	One, what does your lease say?  And two, if you do not think you are responsible for replacing carpet that is 7 years old and has been cleaned then I suggest you take it to court.  Sounds to me like he is trying to get new carpet and you are the patsy.|`|HIwJFtNlaa	My parents own three income properties; so I know about that area.<br>  As unfair as that may sound, they can. <br>  It's the landlord's preference; unless you can find somewhere in the contract that says that's okay. <br>  sorry, but good luck!|`|oyCq6oG0aa	If you rented that apartment from the landlord and he had full knowledge that you had the dog then No you don't have to pay. If you got the dog after you had the apartment without the landlords consent then Yes you are responsible.
0ZrRRGmiaa	You have to be patient. Take the pup out the second he is done eating. Dogs usually poop very shortly after they eat. Especially puppies.<br>  <br>  As for peeing, watch for the tell tale signs he is gonna go. If he starts sniffing around he needs to go out ASAP.<br>  <br>  Everything is about correction. He poops in the house, take his poop outside and put it where you want him to go. Keep taking him to this spot until he gets it. He will, eventually.|`|GSf09ALBaa	He is very young.  8 weeks old is barely able to figure out where the food is.  You are not giving him enough time to learn and you need to be out there with him when you believe it is potty time.  Get him to move around.  The more blood flowing the better chances of poopage.<br>  <br>  And when he is in the house, use baby gates to block off any areas he can get to you cannot see.  That way you can watch when he is getting ready to go, tell him no, pick him up and let him finish outside.<br>  Praise him like crazy and give a treat.<br>  <br>  Repeat as necessary.|`|xi9amEG2aa	I didn't think 'miniature' Yorkie's existed.<br>  <br>  But anyways, I'll try and help.  You need to take your puppy outside on a regular schedule.  When you wake up, every hour after that, 15-25 mins after he eats or drinks anything, and before you go to bed.  When yoiu take him outside to go potty, go out with him, and give him lots and lots of praise when he goes.  Don't go back inside until he goes pee and poop.  If he goes inside, don't punish him...he might become fearful of you.  <br>  <br>  Puppies don't come potty trained, and I'm assuming you just got him being that he's only 8 weeks old.  You have to be patient.  He's not going to be trained over night or in a couple of hours.  <br>  <br>  You must be patient with him....it does take time for them to learn things.|`|EcgO4dlnaa	You just have to be patient. <br>  Some dogs just take longer to learn. <br>  My dog took until she was 6 months old. <br>  He may start to poop if you take him on walks and let him smell other dogs markings and that may make it more comfortable.<br>  Since he is still a baby he can't hold his urine for very long so you have to take him out very frequently. <br>  Keep watch on him as much as possible.<br>  I would recommend you buy him a crate that is large  enough where he can stand up and turn around in but small enough where he can't pee/poop on one end and sleep on the other. <br>  It is most likely that  your dog won't go 'potty' where he sleeps. <br>  I know it seems kind of cruel to put a dog in a crate at night but trust me it works. <br>  And once you trust him enough to go potty outside he can start sleeping out of the crate but once he goes potty inside the house its back to the crate at night.<br>  Don't really punish your puppy when he goes potty in the house. The best thing to do is take him out side. <br>  You have to watch for warning signs of when he is about to go potty. If you see that he is about to go take him outside immediatly. <br>  Of course its impossible to watch your dog 24/7. <br>  When he cannot be watched put him in the crate.<br>  If you will be out all day try to find someone you can trust to let your dog out to go potty.<br>  Puppies can only hold their urine and poop for an hour or so because their bladder is soo small. If you are going to be out from 8 am to 5 pm its most likely that he will have an accident. But if you have someone let him out every hour while you are gone he should be fine.<br>  Don't let your puppy inside until he goes potty. <br>  When you take him out keep him out, under your supervision of course, until he goes to the bathroom.<br>  Then take him in a make a big deal out of it.<br>  I know it seems crazy to go nuts and  'throw a party' when your dog goes potty but if he sees that he gets attention and treats and lots and lots of love when he goes potty outside he will think its a good thing to go potty outside. <br>  <br>  Good Luck and Enjoy your puppy. <br>  <br>  <br>  Lots and Lots and Lots and Lots of Love,<br>  xoxo Devon xoxo|`|XagPxe7Faa	For starters, at 8 weeks he is too young to have been separated from his mom and litter mates, much less old enough to be fully potty trained.  Reputable breeders do not place pups until they are around 12 weeks old.<br>  <br>  Give him time and be persistant with his training.  He'll catch on.  Research various methods of training and see which one will best fit your lifestyle.<br>  <br>  (Also, there is no such thing as a "miniature" Yorkie.  There is only one standard--"not to exceed 7 pounds.|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	Puppy poop pads - buy them at Petsmart, PetCo, Target, Walmart, etc.<br>  They are attracted to the scent and go pee and poop on them.  Sometimes you might have to move their poop to be on it - or catch them in the act and put them on it.  They'll get the picture.  Then move it closer and closer to the door until you take it away completely and they're outside (and they didn't even suspect foul play!)  YOu can also train your dog to indicate to you that they need to go outside.  Our Jack Russell learned to jump at a bell at the stairs to go out.  She still jumps at the door after we moved houses.  And jumps at the sink for water and at the door where the food is kept for food.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Many runts have internal issues.  Perhaps if you take him to the vet, tell them he's a runt (no such thing as a mini yorkie), and tell him your problem, maybe he can help. :)|`|QRWnKoZAaa	You're puppy is very young and pooping outside makes a dog feel very vulnerable. They'd rather go in a "safe" environment, like the house. Keep taking him out 10 minutes after meals and when he wakes up from a nap. Stay out for 10 minutes and if nothing happens, bring him back in, but keep an eye on him so he can't sneak off and poop inside. Some people tether their dogs to themselves to be able to watch him. Take him out on a leash so he concentrates and stays in one place and doesn't wander around. Keep doing this and eventually he will poop outside, out of necessity. Praise him, give him a treat and let him play outside after he poops. A lot of dogs who are only taken out to poop, learn quickly to hold it in so they can stay outside longer.<br>  <br>  Good luck and be patient! Enjoy your new puppy!|`|iembGsl9aa	First off, you do not have a "miniature" yorkie. <br>  All yorkies follow the standard of "above 7lbs" anything less wuld be a poorly bred runt.<br>  <br>  Ne ways, when he goes in the house, make shure that u clean the area real thoroughly and take him outside. <br>  Or let him outside 4 longer.<br>  Also dont leave an 8 week pup unattended, u shuld be able to c the signs of having to poop and take him outside. <br>  He's 8 freakin weeks old, give him time|`|OGAh1LF9aa	First of all, DO NOT yell at him, shove his nose in it, spray him with water, or scare him. This won't teach him not to poop inside, it will teach him not to poop! :O<br>  Every time he poops inside, firmly tell him no. Take him outside immediately and stand out there with him for a few minutes. Best of all, try to catch him while he's doing it. Pick him up (while he's pooping in the house) and carry him outside. Set him on the grass. Wait until he poops, or you're sure he won't. Then take him back in and repeat.<br>  Hopefully this will help. Eventually, he'll get the hang of it, just be consistent! Good luck!|`|iFWUhpiOaa	I have had many dogs over the years and there was never one that showed an interest in going outside to use the bathroom exclusively at 8 weeks old! I sure would like to win the 10 pts. but I just don't have any other suggestion except to keep trying! If your pooch poos in the house, pick it and the pup up and take them out side. Put the poo on the ground beside her. If you do that consistently as well as praise her when she does go poo outside then add a little patience and presto! Potty trained doggy! Good luck.|`|FDQg1ldFaa	while u try and train her to go outdoors you should go to the pet store and get some training pads and put them in certain areas of the house so that it will get used to going on the training pads then when u take it out start bringing the pads outdoors and after a while the dog will use it outdoors and on the training pads when its inside like mines does|`|lNG9sRrpaa	Take him outside when you KNOW that he has to go, for example 30 min after he eats..when he wakes up...or after you guys play...and then immediately take him outside...and as SOON as he does it...praise him and give him snack.<br>  <br>  You must keep this up consistently for a week for it to work!<br>  <br>  Remember dogs learn by cause and reaciton...good luck!|`|KJMOvKcSaa	What you do is you walk him for like....15-20 minutes and if he poos then give him a treat and lots of attention. Eventually he will get it and poop for the treat and attention.
GQ7vXJ8zaa	Male cats are less temperamental than female cats.  I've had a lot of both and the females tend to go after other females more than they do males.  Besides the males usually just shrug them off after a while.<br>  <br>  For names you're on your own.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	At her age, it may be difficult for her to accept any new kitten.  You have a declawed cat - they can feel very threatened with a new cat.  And females tend to be more territorial with newcomers - especially another female.<br>  <br>  The better fit would be a male kitten (neutered).  But if you plan on declawing that kitten too, then I would not recommend you get any new cats/kittens.<br>  <br>  Read this about declawing and see what really happens.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://maxshouse.com/Truth%20About%20Declawing.htm" rel="nofollow">http://maxshouse.com/Truth%20About%20Dec...</a>|`|e124e8765c4b0ed9c4d1ca5f0af5f848aa	Female, And name her Cali!|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	i would not get another cat.<br>  <br>  your cat will be stressing over the loss of her friend. then she will stress over a new kitten, adult cats do not understand kittens, they do not see them as baby cats. <br>  kittens want to play with anything and annoy cats.<br>  <br>  if you get an adult, they will fight with each other.<br>  <br>  if you really want another cat, i would get an old cat. they are more interested in staying away from each other and sleeping.<br>  <br>  as for gender, once neutered/spayed, there is very little difference. males tend to be more of a lap cat, because they are lazy, females more independent, but playful, because the wild, the males make the women do everything.<br>  <br>  if you intend to detoe your new cat, please leave it to die homeless and unloved in a shelter, at least it will die with its toes.|`|fb8a814c78b9ea803ce553353913cea0aa	I have a 5 year old female.  And recently I acquired a new kitten.  She's female too.  Now the older cat makes it known that she is "top cat" by bossing the new kitty, but over time, it has gotten somewhat better.  The new kitty takes it all in stride.  Both are wonderful pets.  <br>  <br>  I recommend another female.|`|AA12151645	If it was me I'd go for Kate Moss - she'd make a great sex kitten.|`|gTQwwDQtaa	Maybe a male, because females are pretty territorial, and males are a bit more laid back.<br>  <br>  But I mean if she got along good with your other female, who knows. Generally it is better to get a new kitten to pair with your adult then a new adult.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  As for names...I think Oliver is adorable for a boy. Or Todd.|`|yLiOgVEYaa	i don't think it really maters on the gender. make sure you get it fixed. but i think it would be better if you get a male. i have a 16yr female and she is the "queen" as your 12yr is too. i also have a male that is 6. they deal with each other, but i think it would be worse had i brought another female home. but it's really your choice.

I think you should name her Zoey!|`|kNYDHZqAaa	I don't think you should declaw cats, but then again, maybe you shouldn't put a cat with claws with your declawed cat. Maybe you could try to find a cat that is already declawed at your local shelter? Every time I've been to the shelters, they've had cats there that were declawed by previous owners. I'd recommend getting one that is a little older (maybe a few years) so that it won't scare or upset your cat, since she is 12. Sometimes older cats really don't enjoy being around kittens. I'm not sure that the sex matters so much as the temperament of the cat and whether or not it seems like a cat that would be a good match for your existing cat.|`|szI6Y0CLaa	Typically a male cat will try to dominate the female and it can cause problems but a strong female can hold her own with a male kitten.  The younger the kitten the better. A female kitten may be more acceptable but if your adult female has a strong personality she may dominate a male kitten without any problem. <br>  Males are known to be more affectionate(and needy) and females more aloof and independent.  <br>  <br>  Names? Cats are adventurers, explorers and rulers of their domain, take inspiration from that.
LxAuBSjQaa	If she's getting thin I'd recommend separating them for an hour or so a day so she can eat in peace, my younger rats sometimes steal food from the older ones.  Upping the food often doesn't help enough.  I would try that first though, giving them more food daily might help.  If not separating them during feeding time may give her a chance to get her fill without keeping her away from her family for too long.|`|CqquoBy4aa	They kind of is.  I'm not sure.|`|xLNzdxsOaa	Rats generally care for the elderly, the order of dominance is probably changing. If it gets extremely violent (blood) or continues for more than a few weeks, then it's time to separate them.|`|A2IDiIpIaa	No rats do not kill off weaker members of the group. Unless you are not giving them enough food or space, they will not fight in general.<br>  Did you do proper introductions?<br>  Did you insure they all get along in general because just like people some just do not like each other?<br>  Other than that they might be play fighting. Squeaking is perfectly fine, as long is no blood is shed. <br>  The little ones are just saying "Grandma, this is our cage."<br>  Hope I helped|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	I put a baby rat with my older rat, they bickered at each other for a couple days and where soon best friends, however the younger female rules the house. .the adult is a male.  Rats are very social and love company old or young .  The younger rats may relize the old lady of the group is getting old and ready to die, they may be worried and trying to get her to play and jump around.  They are very smart and intune with each other, if you seperate her now she may die earlier then expected.  Just make sure to give her extra love and attention, she is an old lady :)   You should give her some space to relax, give her like an hour a day away from all the younger rats.. they are probably wearing her out :)|`|R0WgaUdgaa	Hi hun,<br>  Keep an eye on them and if the confrontations start getting violent then it's time to separate them. If anything what they are doing is trying to figure out who is next in the higher archy.<br>  They should not kill the older one. Rats are known for actually taking care of their elders, feeding them, cleaning them, etc.<br>  Just keep an eye on them and if it gets bad them separate them.<br>  Hope all goes well.<br>  :-)|`|KToEYmwWaa	Was your older rat the dominant?  If so, the younger rats may realize she is older now and trying to establish new dominance.  I don't think rats would kill an older weaker rat because they are so social, but you never know.  Keep a close eye on them and inspect the older one daily for injuries.  If things get out of hand then separate them.|`|hC4Z8HIbaa	Younger rats may develop a dominance over the older, weaker rat, but they will not kill her. You should only separate the rats if you suspect the old rat to be in immediate danger. This would mean being involved with serious, bloodsheding fights with the younger rats. I don't forsee this happening, but it could be a possibility. Just leave your older rat in with the younger ones. It would be best for her to live out her life the way she is used to living it, instead of in a seperate cage away from her friends.<br>  <br>  If you've never been before, go to the website below. It has tons of great information for rat owners. I am a member there, and I recommend it to all rat owners.
GSf09ALBaa	You are fine.  Keep her quiet until you can get her to the vet.  Good job keeping an eye on things.|`|8GVEqyPmaa	There are rare in dogs problems like this. You are already on the right tract... see the vet.
m1ypmbNKaa	Well, here is a list of things you can feed him that are safe, and are human foods:<br>  <br>  Apples<br>  Pears,<br>  peaches,<br>  bananas,<br>  berries,<br>  kiwi,<br>  pomegranate,<br>  grapes,<br>  raisins,<br>  carrots,<br>  sweet potatoes,<br>  beets,<br>  broccoli,<br>  legumes,<br>  frozen mixed vegetables,<br>  kale,<br>  greens (not lettuce),<br>  greenpeppers,<br>  zucchini and other squash,<br>  asparagus,<br>  ripe tomatoes,<br>  dried hot peppers,<br>  sprouts-bean or<br>  alfalfa,<br>  spinach, and<br>  brussels sprouts.<br>  Bean sprouts<br>  use red, green, and yellow Bell Peppers for this recipe. I cut the Bell Pepper into little rings, or circle, so it looks like "O". Make sure you take out all of the seeds, and make sure you wash it very well. Hang them around the cage, or put them in a bowl together and let your bird paly with them! They love to use them as necklaces, munch on them, and hold them on their food. This is a great, healthy, and very fun toy for your cockatiel!<br>  <br>  Fruits:<br>  Apples<br>  Pears<br>  Peaches<br>  Bananas<br>  Berries<br>  Kiwi<br>  Pomegranate<br>  Grapes<br>  <br>  Before feeding your parakeets any fruits or vegetables, clean well! Most store bought fruits/veggies have pesticides on them which can prove to be lethal to your bird.<br>  <br>  Veggies:<br>  Carrots<br>  Sweet Potatoes<br>  Broccoli<br>  Cauliflower<br>  Bell Peppers<br>  Beets<br>  Legumes<br>  Frozen Mixed Vegetables<br>  Kale<br>  Zucchini (and other squash)<br>  Asparagus<br>  Bean or Alfalfa Sprouts<br>  Spinach<br>  Brussels Sprouts<br>  <br>  Again, make sure you clean well! Pesticides are used on store-bought vegetables and plants and can kill your bird.<br>  <br>  Also, try cutting up the veggies or fruits into dices, long slices, or thin little strips. You can feed apple whole as long as you skin it. My birds love to shred apple! You can also feed them *plain* apple sauce! Also, make sure you remove the roots, pits, and seeds of the food you give them.<br>  <br>  Foods You Should NEVER Feed:<br>  <br>  Chocolate<br>  Avocado<br>  Sugary Foods<br>  Salty Foods<br>  Greasy Foods<br>  High Fat Content Foods<br>  Caffeine<br>  Soda<br>  Alcohol<br>  Pits/Seeds/Roots of Fruits/Veggies<br>  Candy<br>  Rhubarb<br>  <br>  Here is another list with more options:<br>  <br>  Greens: Kale, Bok choy, spinach, chard, mustard greens, radish, carrot tops, beet tops, dandelion greens (make sure they haven't been sprayed or collected near a roadway) and just about any other leafy green veggie.<br>  <br>  Veggies: Carrots, peas, zucchini, corn, squash, radishes, bell pepper, broccoli, green beans, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, sweet potatoes, chili peppers.<br>  <br>  Grains: Steamed rice (white, brown, wild) cooked pasta, whole wheat and multi-grain bread, popcorn (no butter), bran muffins, polenta, grits, cous cous, sprouted seeds and grains (quinoa, amaranth, millet, teff, kamut, spelt), oatmeal, all natural cereal.<br>  <br>  Proteins: Raw sunflower seed (small amounts), chicken, eggs, fish, small amounts of hard cheese such as Jack and cheddar, tofu, cooked beans (lentil, kidney, black, garbanzo, navy, white).<br>  <br>  Fruit: Apples (seeds removed), peaches, bananas, melons, mango, pomegranate, oranges, papaya, strawberries, plums, pears, berries, nectarines, cherries. (Please remove all pits from fruit.)|`|ZrkGLjq4aa	There is a wide variety of fruits and vegetables that you can serve to your cockatiels. The red-orange-yellow fruits and vegetables, and some of the green leafy vegetables, are the best sources of vitamin A. <br>  <br>  Vegetables include: Carrots (with the tops), yams, hot or chili peppers, pumpkin, most of the squash family, and sweet potato, dandelion (including the flower), collard greens, kale, sprouts, spinach, turnip greens, Swiss chard, mustard greens, broccoli, escarole or chicory, beet greens, and bok choy. <br>  <br>  Fruits include: Mangos, cantaloupe, persimmons, and to a lesser extent, apricots, nectarines, papayas, tomatoes and peaches.<br>  <br>  Remember to always remove fruit pits. Cherry pits are known to be deadly, and other fruit pits may contain trace amounts of cyanide and are dangerous to your birds. <br>  <br>  <br>  Adding vegetables and fruits to your birds diet is an excellent way to cure boredom and complete a diet. However, I recommend supplementing pellets for seeds in your cockatiels diet. Pellets contain all the nutrients your birds need and are less fattening than seeds. You can find them in your local pet store. Brands I recommend include: Zupreem, Roudybush and Harrisons.|`|OP0WnHYZaa	the previous answer is great, as they said never avocardo it will kill the bird and dond feed lettuce doesnt agree with there belly.|`|6Jtr4m3Faa	let your cocktails eat broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, apple, pear, peach, pineapple, guava, mango, fresh corn and cottage cheese.

wADItPRyaa	You didn't say if he's on pasture or gets hay, but the best thing you can do for him is to let him run around and be a baby. As he grows and develops from playing with his turnout buddies, he'll build muscle and strengthen tendons, ligaments, and bone, and his hocks should straighten out. His hips will become wider and the legs should come more squarely underneath him. However, some slight cow-hocked conformation can be a good thing, as it allows a horse to really dig in and push off of his hind end. Too much isn't good, but a little won't hurt. <br>  <br>  In any case, forage-based diets are always best for horses (forage = hay and/or pasture). Nutrina is generally a good quality feed manufacturer, though I'm not familiar with their Triumphant product. I would caution you to weigh your feed, though, rather than going by volume - it's a much more accurate way to measure his intake, and all feed bags have recommended feeding amounts listed by weight. <br>  <br>  If you're really worried about his conformation and how it may affect his development, the best route would be to talk to your vet. If you have the vet out in the spring for shots and a checkup like most people (I know some people chose to do their own vaccinations), then that would be a good time to ask.|`|mEKsbCw2aa	Do you have any pictures?
px27V5N9aa	First, don't over supplement or overfeed him. You don't want him to grow too fast or it will be detrimental!<br>  A 14% grow and perform type grain and hay.<br>  <br>  As for his hocks, as stated by the others as he grows they will stop touching like you observe now, but he will always have this.  He's still got alot of growing to do but DO get a farrier out now.  If there is any correcting to be done you can't wait any longer. It's almost at the cut off.  All foals should have their feet done by the time they are 9mos anyhow. :)<br>  <br>  So..cut back on your supplements.  1 1/2 qt 2x daily is good though.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	First do not feed him fast growth feeds, second get a good farrier to work with him.  Corrective trimming can do wonders, they also have special glue on shoes that can help..  One other thing, it can be expensive, is talk to your vet about braces.  I agree with the poster oh how he can grow out of it.. that is true, with the proper nutrition and trimming.  I had a colt that was born with every leg problem you could think of, bad enough that my vet thought bracing may be the only answer. He was a scrawny lil thing too. Long story short he grew out of it with constant trimming and I fed him only Purina Junior. He turned out to be a beautiful 16h horse.<br>  Check with your vet and get a good nutrition program going and find a good farrier.  :-)  You need to take care of it now while he is still young and growing.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Hey, thanks for the question.<br>   I'll tell you about my horse.  I got him when he was 9 months old Extremely well bred  and the reason I got him for next to nothing is because he to was cow hocked and almost rubbed his hocks together much like what you are describing.<br>    Good news he is almost six now and has completely blossomed into a gorgeous boy.  As he matured, widened, and filled out you wouldn't have guessed that he was like that.  He would still be considered a little cow hocked but let me tell you he can really get down and use his hind end. He is very talented.<br>    You said he straightens out when he walks and stands almost square.  So give him some time to grow up and evaluate him then to see if he will make a good reiner.<br>    And a little cow hocked makes a great reining horse because they work off there back end better.  You want them to have a longer distance between the hip and the hock and have shorter cannon bones.<br>    If they slide a little wide you can fix that with a by dragging a spoon which is on the heal of the slider shoe.  You can spoon the inside or outside depending if they slide wide  or narrow.<br>  <br>  Just give him time to grow up :)<br>  <br>  Jenny|`|oQmL4IdWaa	No, he will not grow out of the cow wickedness.  As he grows, and his body widens, he may stop touching, but he will stay cow hocked.  I would consult a really good, experienced farrier, because good trimming may help him some, but 9 months is to old to make any drastic changes.<br>  <br>  As a reining horse, you absolutely DO NOT want him to be cow hocked.  Reining is very stressful on the hocks, and correct hocks are extremely important.  It is ok if his hind legs angle out slightly, but if you look at his legs from behind they should be straight,  his hocks should not be closer together than his hoofs are (if that makes sense).<br>  <br>  I am also concerned about your feeding program.  I am not sure exactly what neutrino triumphant contains because I have never fed it, but most of neutron's products contain all the vitamins and minerals a horse should need.  Adding grow colt on top of that may unbalance his diet.  It is extremely important that you balance the calcium / phosphorous ratio in growing horses.  It is also important to have all the correct vitamins  and minerals, but some are toxic if the horse gets to much.  I would simply by feeding one grain product formulated to your type of hay, your horses life stage, and your geographic area (or the area your hay is grown in).  That or talk to your vet or a nutritionist to develop a feeding plan, it can get pretty complicated, and growing horses are extremely sensitive.  The wrong balance can ruin their bones and joints for life.

c93ea3c8cf1c3dd9a0e3b461289096d9aa	She could just be tramuatized by the experience and is having a hard time readjusting.  To be safe, you should take little Lola to the vet, to make sure there is no internal bleeding or other problems; pain can also make dogs grumpy.<br>  Hope she feels better soon.|`|Dkb2ZR3Daa	"The people we picked her up from seemed a bit white-trashy. They had large dogs that seemed very aggressive."<br>  They returned your dog didn't they? I think that's a little rude considering you were very irresponsible by letting Lola get away.<br>  <br>  Take her to the vet, have x-rays done to check things internally, no one will really be able to help you from the internet.|`|GSf09ALBaa	She was hit by a car, I don't care what the white-trashy people are saying.  Take her to the vet.  She definitely got hit.|`|v0RsFaAzaa	If this happened 4 days ago and you have not taken her to the vet yet, what the heck are you waiting for. You don't even know if "Your Precious Little Girl" was hit by a car, beaten by someone, gotten into something poisonous or attacked by another animal! If she's not acting like herself, her stomach is tight or hard, you better get moving. She may have Internal injuries you can't see, and if you don't take her to the Emergency Vet Tonight, you may have a dead dog in the morning. We can't help your dog over the Internet, so get off the computer and get her to someone who can help her, before she dies. She's already suffered way too long!|`|87c9334db675954580771148348307f3aa	I'm sorry that my only advice is to take her to the vet.  That will put your mind at ease.  Good luck|`|p79QDIFWaa	Go to the vet!|`|CscCdffnaa	You need to take her to the vet. Even if she wasn't hit by the tires, she may have been hit by another part of the car or she may have been hit by the tires, but the car had been slowing down first.  Theres a chance she has something wrong with her internal organs that you would be unable to spot. Even if nothing is physically wrong with her, taking her to the vet is a good idea and will calm your mind knowing she is physically okay.<br>  <br>  If you take her to the vet, and she is okay physically, her behaviors are expected. She's probably very sore & traumatized.  Anyone or anything hit by a car would be affected emotionally by the incident. Its natural.<br>  <br>  I hope your dog's okay, but you need to take her to the vet & next time don't let her run so far. Go after her, coax her with treats.  That way, you'll know and see exactly what happens if she does get hit.|`|426c98c5e6499e1f282c417b905cea60aa	Even if she rolled under the car she still could have been injured.

juyA6HUJaa	Do NOT get him a hamster wheel whatever you do thats probably he worst thing you can do, it can make them disabled and curve their spine so they "hop" instead of walking, <br>  <a href="http://www.cavygalore.proboards.com/index.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://www.cavygalore.proboards.com/inde...</a><br>  thats a real good site full of guinea pig owners and people who know a lot about them if you ask a question they answer with correct answers as soon as they can, but just please dont buy a wheel or ball, I think he's being a pig they love to dig and chew things|`|YFTZM86maa	Some are big diggers, it's natural.  He may be bored and needs some new things to do.  You can make some toys or use household things to create sensory places in the cage...a piece of fleece he can hide under, some jingle bells tied to the cage, a mirror, a brick...  Ping pong balls can be fun for them to push.  He might be shredding paper because he needs hay.  They like to graze and munch all day long. He may be feeling like he's missing salt or something else in his diet and is searching for it.  Mine shreds newspaper just for the fun of it, but doesn't eat much.  He'll also flip over his pigloo now and then, so I change position of it and other things in the cage to mix things up so he can explore and not be bored when I'm away from home.<br>  I don't think he's mad, but he may be missing something and looking for it.  He might have a little OCD, one can never be too sure why they do what they do.|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	Do not put him in a ball, guinea pigs spines are not stable enough for balls and you can cause him  a lot of damage by doing so. I do not know what make me think this but have you check his skin for any skin issues. it seems almost like he is trying to lie on the smooth cool surface of the bottom of the cage.it sounds as though he gets plenty of attention so it is not a boredom problem.That is the only thing i can think of so please check his skin to see if he might have some kind of rash, mites or something making him uncomfortable. Oh i just remembered i have had one that liked to pull up the paper from the bottom of the cage if i did not take care to get it down very carefully so she could not find a corner to pull at.<br>  <br>  <br>  the best of luck to you and your guinea pig|`|2oS5qZq3aa	well guinea pigs arent supposed to have a buddy they can live alone the only difference is that he would be more playful and maybe more healthy with someone to play with him,but it not necessary.<br>  if he is digging maybe its because he found something disturbing down there<br>  guinea pigs don't really dig because their hands arent that fast to move<br>  if he's eating the newspaper maybe its because he need something to chew<br>  make sure you have some wood or something that they can chew or his teeth will fall out<br>  <br>  what guinea pigs really like to do is to take baths with shavings <br>  mine love to go in the shaving and jump sometimes they dig but not very often <br>  you should try cleaning it maybe he found something disturbing or something<br>  <br>  good luck|`|4b5106290d0dd7b8527192088f2ec6b6aa	It sounds as if you're trying to take good care of him and I don't feel from your description that there is anything physically wrong with him. Honestly, he sounds bored and he's just trying to find something to entertain himself.<br>  <br>  You may want to check with a local guinea pig rescue and see if they can't help you find a good match for him.|`|aiIS83Onaa	it's probably just a habit.<br>  one of our guinea pigs liked to put the food bowl on her head and run around. we thought she was stuck at first but then she backed up, grabbed it in her teeth, and flipped it back over her head again. <br>  I don't think it's really a problem. he seems happy from what I hear :)|`|Z9xy3Mwxaa	its normal for a guinea pig to dig and they love to chew on paper thats kind of like their hobby they love to chew timothy hay non chemical treated wood|`|ZxLzNWvkaa	ok, you said hes eating his newspaper lining,thats because he need something to naw his teeth on like a stick of wood or cardboard.<br>  He is digging at the bottem of his cage maybe because hes not getting the exersize he needs.Get him a hamster wheel thats big anough for him.

9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Yes, to an extent. There's going to be swelling as it heals which can make the belly feel hard.

The person who said use cactus on your birds wound....please do not listen to. Some plants are highly toxic to birds. I would not rub any kind of ointment on my bird unless it was approved by a vet.|`|OyNJTWaiaa	If you can work out if the bleeding is from a broken feather then you need to do this...<br>  You need to pull out the shaft of the blood feather immediately.

That will help stop the bleeding.  If you don't have that flour will work too.  If it is not really severe, it should stop on it's own in a few mintues, but if you are seeing large amounts of blood you should be very concerned.  You should call the vet just to be safe.|`|24b558aaf77e8dc4e04518b037561692aa	Pour alittle Corn Starch in a bowl and with your thumb and index finger<br>  grab some and slightly push it right where it is bleeding. You may need to do it again. This is safe - and doesn't burn.<br>  <br>  Becareful not to press hard though, birds bone are filled with air only and they can break easily.|`|UXfvkl9gaa	get a towl and hold him down and put some flower on the wond that should make it feel beter for him and it makes the bleeding stop|`|ypVKuCDLaa	I have razed alot of birds, if it is not bad, just scratch then he will be ok,. But if its bad call the vet know.|`|G9EJuDyGaa	Lots more information is needed to properly answer your question.  Is a blood feather bleeding?  If so, just keep an eye on it and make sure it stops.  If you have some quik-stop, you can apply that.  If not, corn meal or flour will work in a pinch.  Birds don't clot well, so sometimes you have to help them along.  DO NOT put alcohol or cactus on it, as one person suggested.  If it is NOT a blood feather bleeding, than you will need to take him to the vet.  Good luck.|`|Dn1wcJlqaa	Okay, What you need to do is calm down first. She can sense your fear and panic, and that will make her feel the same way. You need to get some gauze, and wrap it around to stop the bleeding for now. If it is dirty i would suggest you wash it gently with a warm wash cloth before wrapping it. The I would suggest changing the gauze every so often if it gets too bloody or dirty. If it is not severe, like you say, this should work. I really hope I helped because i know how you feel!|`|QQfxUMGEaa	i'm so sorry!

The mixed breed is one great choice, due to the many great characteristics in different breeds all rolled up in to one beautiful, mutt. Mutts come in all shapes and sizes, and personalities. If you do get a small dog, don't pamper it with clothes and jewelery, please! They are dogs. Dogs that like to get dirty, play, all kinds of dog things. They're not people.

If the remaining puppy is not feeding then you need to take mother and puppy to the vet before you lose this pup as well.|`|o93EwErKaa	No, you shouldn't feed human formula because of the higher lactose content.  You would be better off making a homemade formula.  Here is a link.  I prefer goat's milk over evaporated milk, but both are used so should be fine either way.  Here is a link to the formula.

The crying from another part of the house when it is dark and quiet - I am not exactly sure why, but one of my cats does this.  She calls from upstairs late in the evening when me, my boyfriend, and our male cat are downstairs doing quiet things like reading or internet surfing.  It's like things are too quiet for her and she feels isolated.

We hoped it would work, but it didn't, so we decided to take her off the meds and got better educated about food ingredients, esp since we were panicked about the pet food crisis.  She didn't get rid of the diarrhea even on the premium foods until we tried her on diets with uncommon main meat ingredients.  The vet wanted to do a science diet for sensitive stomachs formula, but it had ingredients I wasn't comfortable feeding due to the pet food problems at the time.<br>  He was ok with her health otherwise so he was ok with our decision.<br>  Turns out she's intolerant of chicken, so after lots of experimentation, we feed her Natural Balance Venison and Green Pea wet food and California Naturals Herring dry formula (which has chicken fat, but for some reason she's fine with it).  And nothing with wheat, corn or soy in it, or anything marked as a gluten.<br>  It took months to figure it out and for it to clear up, but what a difference in the litter box AND in her personality. So much more active now. No growling in the tummy, no mess, and she's energetic.<br>  Read up on the ingredients like you've been doing, be patient, slowly change the diet over the course of a week, and keep an eye on what happens. <br>  Good luck.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	For the diarrhea get some acidoupholous from a health food store and sprinkle about 1/8th a teaspoon on the food. It is a pro biotic and it should do the trick<br>   I looked at natual balance canned (dry isn't allowed within 5 miles of my house) and I would call it a middle grade food. It uses muscle meat as the first ingrediant but most of them still have grains<br>   If your cat really has a sensitive stomach then you need (you should be doing this anyway) to start with a grain free canned food or a raw diet. If that doesn't work then you would have to look for allergies and start eliminating certain things to find the cause<br>   Best of luck

There is LOADS of information all over the internet, it would be a good idea to research them there. 2 males generally cannot be kept together, they kill each other unless they have a ton of space and even then, they might have some confrontation.

znGpjsGjaa	The Mini Lop rabbit is the middle of the Lop family of rabbits. They grow to be around 6 pounds. Even though their name sounds as if they are small the are not the smallest of the Lops. That would be the Holland Lop. The largest is the French Lop which tops out at 10 pounds and over.<br>  <br>  As for length and width that can vary but most Mini Lops are around 14-16 inches long. They are a well rounded breed and look like a furry football.<br>  <br>  If you are trying to figure out what size cage you will need by knowing the size. Remember bigger is always better. A good size cage is 30 inches X 30 inches. That is a good size for all but the giant breeds of rabbits.
3LXbUg1raa	If pulling isn't an option, and you want the mane that short, then I'd suggest trying out some scissors.  I've never heard of using a dematting comb to "cut" a mane (of course there is always a first for everything)...I've only heard of a dematting comb being used instead of pulling a mane to both shorten and thin the mane at the same time yet still have it look relatively natural...to do that, you will first want to comb through the mane making sure there are no tangles/knots...then commence combing through the mane with the dematting comb...as you are combing with the dematting comb, working one section at a time, you can alternate with slicing the comb across the ends of the mane to shorten it at the same time...to give you a more visual picture of this, picture how a beautician will sometimes use a razor when cutting hair...it is somewhat similar to that.  Dematting combs' teeth are sharpened so that they slice and cut some of the hair effectively thinning and shortening it...|`|AA11498082	Agree with Justa.  WHY on earth would you want to do that?  Looks gawdawful.  Usually for the "big time" shows hopefully a practice that has ended.  (sorry, your kid's grooming doesn't make him look like a "show horse") <br>  <br>  If you want to even the mane use regular scissors and cut into the hair as opposed to across.  Think Pinking shears, you know the ones whos blades make a series of "v" cuts (vvvvvvvvvv) for a more natural appearance.|`|waoh4KUZaa	You can use a clipper blade. Like, whatever you put on the trim his nose or something, take the blade off and just cut the ends of his mane. It makes it a lot more natural than actually cutting it.|`|an1L8njXaa	I dont know how that works but any way if you cut the mane using a blade of any form then whilst it may look ok you will have major problems plaiting (braiding). You will end up with spikey bits popping out of your plaits.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	I gotta ask.. what is your purpose to make the mane so short? Will you be showing in registered shows?  If not, there is really no reason for it. (Of course I don't think it's proper in registered shows, either).  Manes are on a horse for a reason. A good combing would make it look nice.<br>  Anyhow, if you really need to do that, Take some scissors and cut the mane evenly about 1 inch longer than you want it.  Then you can take some people thinning shears and cut along the ends.  That will give it a more natural look.<br>  Be aware tho, cutting it so short may make it stand up.  You may need to braid/band it to keep it in position, until you take it out.<br>  I am not picking on you..just asking why you want it to look like that  :-)

F3LBgfvwaa	It's a nutritional supplement, and it's also used as a treat because they love the taste. It helps to train them and I use it to pacify my ferrets while I clip their nails haha.|`|CEgq26oHaa	It is a nutritional supplement, but it also helps to keep your ferret's coat healthy and prevent hair loss.  Ferrets love it, and I mix a little in with my ferret's food.  Also, if you are going to get a ferret, I would highly recommend feeding Marshalls Premiem Ferret food.  It's a little more expensive than the other brands but is supposed to be the best food for ferrets.  I don't know what websites you've checked out yet, but www.drsfosterandsmith.com sells a lot of ferret supplies, supplements and food for reasonable prices.  They might also have some articles you can read further on www.peteducation.com

GMmS5ajDaa	Don’t listen to any of the above... Ive never heard of dogs predominately living "inside" - dogs can LIVE where ever suits you! They are domesticated that’s right but that doesn’t mean they live in the house with you! It means they are socialized with humans instead of running free in the wild!! Anyway who wants a huge dog jumping, peeing, pooing, eating and destroying their furniture when you’re not at home?! Not me.<br>  <br>  Almost 99% of my friends have “outside” dogs and there is NOTHING wrong with them – all fully social and their owners love them to bits and they do not get ignored just because they live outside. Anyway that’s my stab at the above people! DON’T LISTEN TO ANY OF THEM :)<br>  <br>  I suggest you find a dog that will suit your lifestyle… Im not a fluffy-small-yapping-dog-kind of person myself; I have a Staffie x Kelpie (will be very active when older!) and he is the most wonderful companion :) Even for only 11 weeks old. Before you adopt a new little friend do some research into a few different breeds of dog that you like examples may be: Husky, Staffie, Mastiff’s, Kelpie’s, Border Collies etc (these are all medium sized dogs).<br>  <br>  Then ask yourself if you want a purebred or a mix? There are just as many positives and negatives to getting a mix over a purebred – plus I think it all comes down to the owner how any dog will turn out. Also keep in mind… bigger dogs eat a LOT of food and need more exercise over the smaller ones. Don’t forget to take into account dogs need vaccinations, micro-chipping and any good owner will have him/her sterilized as well. <br>  <br>  Anyway enough from me… all the best in whatever you decide :)|`|9825a4accf342d98abca06fdb35d659aaa	How about a nice mixed breed dog from the Humane Society? There are so many nice dogs looking for homes and hoping to find one before they get put down and mixed breed dogs can make great pets. You can go and meet the dogs and spend time with them--take them for walks and play sessions, until you find one that seems right for you. If you are going to have the dog live outside you should get an adult dog (at least one year old) because puppies really need to be around people more constantly in order to be properly socialized and trained.|`|gADpKFktaa	I use to live on a farm well my parent need a dog to help with the animal so they got a border collie. It's med build, black and white in color, will follow you and also protect your animal b/c that what it was breed to do. If I lived on a place with a lot of land I would get another one in a heartbeat. If at anything just google border collie look at them, read a little bit about them. They great farm dogs. Love to be outside.|`|HrewRe7saa	If you're not willing to allow your dog in with the rest of the family then maybe you could consider not owning one.  Dogs are very, very social animals and unless you're going to spend the majority of YOUR time outside with it instead of inside away from it, it may be best not to just get one then neglect it.|`|4SQx8smEaa	Let me get this straight...you want to get a dog, but you want to keep it outside???<br>  That is not a life for any dog...I am sorry<br>  And by the way it is not silly...it is truthful<br>  Dogs need companionship...they are not lawn orniments<br>  <br>  <br>  At least 157 U.S. children have been killed or severely injured by chained dogs in the past 4 years. Chaining dogs can have tragic consequences. This practice is not only inhumane, but also creates a very real threat to humans as well as dogs and other animals. Chained or penned outdoor dogs are at significant risk for developing aggression. Dogs are social creatures that closely resemble humans in their need for companionship, but when forced to live in isolation, they can develop strong and potentially dangerous territorial instincts. A solitary existence is stressful and fosters anxiety in dogs, which in turn can make them hypervigilant about defending themselves and their living area. Unfortunately, this can (and does) develop into aggression. A small child wandering into the territory of an unsocialized outdoor dog may be perceived as a threat. <br>  <br>  Granted, not all outdoor dogs manifest aggressive tendencies; many suffer in silence, unacknowledged and ignored. These dogs often develop permanent emotional problems, nervous behaviors and anxiety disorders. The negative behavioral consequences of chaining and penning are difficult to reverse and in some cases impossible to remedy. Why do people force their dogs to live outside? As a representative for Dogs Deserve Better, I have heard numerous excuses for chaining and penning and would like to address some of the myths about outdoor dogs.<br>  <br>  Justification #1: My dog is destructive in the house.<br>  This is a common reason why people keep their dogs outside. It is true that many young dogs tend to chew and destroy things when left to their own devices. Often, however, this is a sign of boredom on the part of the dog that can be very easily prevented by keeping your dog busy (a tired dog is a good dog!), and proper crate training to protect your belongings (and your dog) when you are away. Many people are unaware that dogs almost ALWAYS grow out of this frustrating behavior. I recently took in a 4 year old lab mix that was originally chained outside for destructive behaviors. In the three months of foster care, he has yet to chew or destroy anything.<br>  <br>  Justification #2: My dog is not housebroken. <br>  Failures in housebreaking almost always result from a lack of training by the dog’s caretaker. When you adopt a dog, you need to be vigilant about establishing good “potty habits,” teaching your dog the proper place to eliminate, and keeping him/her confined when you are unable to monitor behavior. This is especially important in puppies (and especially easy!). Adult dogs are more difficult to train, but NOT impossible. In several years of taking in over 100 dogs, I have encountered only one that I was unable to fully housebreak. However, this is extremely rare, and related more to the elder dog’s physical health than his inability to learn. <br>  <br>  Justification #3: My dog sheds (or is dirty).<br>  Yep, the majority of dogs shed. It’s a fact. I seldom leave my house without a clump of dog hair hanging off my sleeve. However shedding can be kept to a minimum by daily to weekly grooming (depending on the breed), and giving skin and coat supplements. Dogs are not by nature dirty animals. Yes, they may track mud in the house, but this can also be prevented if not eliminated with due vigilance. A friend of mine keeps a towel by her door to wipe her dog’s paws as soon as he comes in the house. She rarely has muddy prints on her floor. And if your dog is stinky, he probably needs a bath, or may have something medically wrong with him. Greasy, scaly, stinky skin is a sign of a medical problem. Take your dog to the vet to rule out medical issues.<br>  <br>  Justification #4: My dog is too big to live in the house.<br>  This is a case when prevention is preferable to cure. If you know that your home is small, then don’t adopt that adorable St Bernard mix puppy. It’s best to research dog breeds before you adopt to find out the “worst case scenario” of adult size. If you mistakenly have gotten a dog that is bigger than expected, TRAIN him! A dog with proper house manners can live anywhere. I know a Doberman who would rather die than steal food off the table (despite the fact that he can rest his head on the kitchen counter). It may take some work, but can be done. As an aside, size and breed traits often become problematic when people adopt puppies; adopting an adult dog provides owners with reasonable certainty about size and temperament and also helps the pet overpopulation crisis.<br>  <br>  Justification #5: My dog is chained outside to protect my property.<br>  This appears to be a case of deficient logic. If you were a burglar, would you be more wary of a dog barking from the back yard chained to a doghouse, or a dog barking from inside the house? Which would deter you more? Furthermore, if you depend on your outdoor dog as a security alarm, consider this: Dog Control Officers called to investigate nuisance barking commonly find the owners’ response to be “I didn’t hear him barking,” because people habituate to sounds they hear all the time. Outdoor dogs often bark at things out of boredom. After your dog barks 5 or 6 times at the squirrel next door, or the UPS truck down the road, or the people across the street, you start to tune them out.<br>  <br>  Justification #6: My dog prefers to be outside.<br>  This is often one of the most difficult myths to debunk. Yes, lots of dogs like it outside. This may be merely because it is a familiar environment and they have no choice. I’ve lost count of the outdoor dogs I have fostered that “prefer being outside,” but spend no more than 5 minutes at a time outside once in my home. They run outside, pee, and then immediately rush back to the door. Dogs do not like being alone. If you are outside with your dogs, then they probably want to be with you. However if you are inside, dogs properly acclimated to living in the house will want to be inside with you. Give them a chance. <br>  <br>  Justification #7: Some dogs are outdoor dogs, and some dogs are indoor dogs.<br>  Why? Is that what your family did? It’s time to break that chain! Ponder this: What is the difference between an outdoor dog and an indoor dog? Owners of outdoor dogs often tell me “Small dogs live inside, and big dogs live outside.” Why do small dogs deserve a warm, safe place to sleep while larger dogs must sleep outside in the cold, heat, and rain? Dogs are social creatures, craving love, attention, and recognition, regardless of their size. Please think twice before you automatically condemn your dog to a life of loneliness and anxiety because of its size. Challenge your own belief system. Challenge your parents’ beliefs. Is there really a reason to make one dog an outdoor dog and another an indoor dog? <br>  <br>  Justification #8: My dog is a hunting dog: he is not a family pet.<br>  Who says dogs can’t be both companion dogs and hunting dogs? Do you believe that allowing your dog to be a part of the family will make him a less effective hunter? I challenge you to entertain the opposite. A dog that lives in your home will be more bonded and in tune with you, and therefore more likely to do what you ask. Dogs are loyal creatures and are eager to please you. I have spoken with multiple hunters who own indoor beagles that state that their dogs remain excellent, reliable hunters with no change in prey drive. Segregating your dog from people has no bearing on their hunting ability. Worldwide, working dogs live with their families. Have you ever heard of a police dog chained outside? How about a seeing-eye dog? Why not? Because dogs do the best jobs when they are bonded with the person for whom they work. The same goes for the hunting and herding breeds.<br>  <br>  When it comes to outdoor dogs, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. PLEASE research the dog you are interested in BEFORE you bring it home! Read about the breed (even mutts share their breeds’ characteristics). How big will the dog be when it’s full-grown? What is the breed temperament? What kind of coat will the dog have? If a clean house is your highest priority, opt for a non-shedding dog. If your house is on the small side, adopt a smaller dog. Also, consider adopting an adult dog over a puppy. When you adopt a puppy, you are adopting the dog you hope he will become. When you adopt an adult dog, you are adopting the dog he is right now. In large part, these preventive measures boil down to the goodness of fit between a dog and its family. If you have problems with your dog and need help--don’t put him outside--call someone! Dogs Deserve Better offers FREE help with dog training. If you simply cannot keep your dog or do not have the time or energy to work with him, we will help you find a new home. Chaining and penning your dog outside is not only cruel but also it is dangerous. Please consider another option! Life at the end of a chain or in a pen is a miserable existence. Dogs are NOT lawn ornaments.

We have a few right now that because their previous owners had them live outside they prefer being outside at this point and it would take a lot of training and encouragment for them to enjoy living inside.<br>  <br>  This is NOT however a good situation for your everyday run of the mill dog. If you have a large fenced in yard and you live in a warm climate, i don't see a problem keeping the dog outside while you're at work/school as an alternative to keeping him in a crate inside. But once you are home the dog should be inside. When was the last time you saw a lone wolf? You don't, dogs AND wolves are pack animals and crave socialization. It is unfair to keep a dog outside the majority of the time, it's much easier to forget about them and not train them properly also. If you want a dog, it should be a companion.|`|AA10112346	No it is not silly. Dogs are DOMESTICATED animals, and need to live indoors. they can PLAY in the yard/ garden and stuff.

Dogs are pack animals that crave companionship. Only coming inside at night time is not an adequate "social life" for a dog. Dogs have been domesticated to live inside. <br>  <br>  Oh, and it's "allowed" not "aloud" :]<br>  <br>  Add: Actually, why do you want a dog in the first place? A dog that lives outside predominantly is less likely to want to protect you or the house because, well they don't see it as their home or their owner. So they figure they don't need to care.<br>  Guard dog reason is out.<br>  <br>  Sled dogs typically live outside as well. But they are out there to pull a sled. And by the sounds of things you're not getting a team. So that's out too.<br>  <br>  What else do people that want to keep their dogs outside all the time typically want a dog for?
NbvTyN7saa	GR are big shedders year round.  Daily brushing certainly does help.  It might be worth your while to have your groomer show you how to properly line brush your dog so that you get more loose fur out with each brushing.  <br>  <br>  Not unless fur in coming out and leaving bald patches or they are scratching a lot would this be a concern.|`|bIaywrBCaa	Not sure how your weather is where you live but this winter will be springlike for a couple of weeks, then back to winter. It sometimes gets an animal's system out of whack. He could actually shed 3 times this year.|`|5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -<br>  Sandra on the first answer is 100% right.  So there is no need to worry love.  And don't feel bad...we've all had "first time" experiences.  The only dumb question is the one that wasn't asked.  There are special brushes that can get in deeper at the pet store (pet co) exclusively for excessive shedders.  Kudos's to you...most people do not take the time to brush their dogs every day!!|`|whdSi5bTaa	i am having the same problem with my jrt, even though they shed all the time but he has been shedding extensively so i called the vet, he said since the heating is always on, my dog is thinking it's spring already and shedding his winter coat, don't worry everything is fine with your dog, just groom him every day.|`|eznL5Zwvaa	As long as there are no bald spots.You may want to go to a pet food store and inquire about a food that will slow down shedding.
OFpl236faa	Yes they are always energetic and usually don't slow down much with age. I know some agility dogs who are still going strong at 9 and 10! Aussies need a job! Walking and running them a couple times a day isn't going to do it. They need both mental and physical stimulation. And since you live in an apartment, it's going to take even more on your part to make sure your dog gets enough exercise. I would look into herding, agility, dock diving, flyball or something because your dog is going to need some sort of activity to keep him happy. Plus you are going to have to go running, biking, playing fetch or something every day so your dog doesn't go stir crazy.|`|fgxajTiBaa	They are working dogs, so yes they will always be energetic. You may get a fluke where you find a lazy Aussie but more often than not they'll be little bundles of energy.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter where you live, honestly any breed of dog can live anywhere as long as it's given proper exercise. Just bring him for a good long walk everyday, between 1-2 hours and if you have a dog park near you see if you can just let him run loose for awhile too.<br>  <br>  A tired dog is a good dog.|`|ALAmdtZVaa	Go for a run<br>  Go for a walk <br>  Go for a Roller blade or bike ride<br>  Play ball in the park (maybe one of those ball flinger things) <br>  If you live near water (if it like swimming) you can play fetch (if it's not too cold)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Your dog will be so happy if you just spend as much time with it as you can!<br>  <br>  Make sure you give it AT THE VERY LEAST 1 hour of exercise a day!|`|qqUvoC5uaa	Long walks<br>  Bike rides<br>  Skijoring<br>  Rollerjoring<br>  Agility<br>  Flyball<br>  Frisbee<br>  <br>  All ways to use up the energy. However you'd have to be diligent.<br>  For when you are not home, a "buster ball" or a toy of the same sort may be a good idea to help keep the aussie occupied. <br>  <br>  I would typically not recommend aussies for apartment life, however if you can provide sufficient exercise and mental stimulation he/she should be fine.|`|9825a4accf342d98abca06fdb35d659aaa	Australian shepherds NEED to have something to do for large parts of the day. They were bred as working dogs, where they would spend hours each day occupied with herding and they can go a bit crazy if they aren't kept busy. If you are in an apartment you are going to have to devote a lot of time to exercising this type of dog. This type of dog can be prone to becoming destructive if he's not kept busy and he gets bored. They are very demanding of your time. If you have the time to spend with the dog they are great family pets, but you need to find him a 'job" to keep him happy. You could look into training him as a therapy dog or something like that. If you are away from home during the day and the dog will be alone a lot you might want to consider a different breed that takes less time. One of the biggest reasons owners give these dogs up is because of the demands the dog place on their time. Any dog from the "working" breeds will need lots of time and exercises.|`|xWyXbsw6aa	big big daily walks/runs, take him to a park and throw a ball around for half hour - that should calm him in the evenings - or a swim in a river etc?|`|YcYgNcndaa	they are becuase i have one
81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	Dogs don't like to be tossed around from one place to another.  They like stability.  Either you or your friend keep him and the other one can come visit, but do not let the dog stay overnight.|`|bIaywrBCaa	he probably misses your girlfriend. Ask the gf, I bet he does the same thing when he is with her|`|5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -<br>  Okay love...you are not telling us "when" he is whining.  Is it just when you are in the car going there?  If so sometimes this is not anxiety but a bit of excitability.  "Are we there yet?" syndrome.  I have a car seat for mine because I travel getting dogs a lot.  My little one will whine so I just say "let's go see ------" and let her relate the name to the next dog or the person we are going to see.  She learns this and it has calmed her.  Having a dog go one place and another for this length of time is not cause for worry.  I am sure that he is used to it by now.  So when the whining is coming just use a calm reassurance that all is well.  My little one likes her head rubbed for a sec or her tummy.  <br>  I wish you well love.|`|1iGp2etEaa	Dogs need structure a routine in their lives and when your tossing this do from house to house he's developing seperation anxiety. it takes a lot of time for a dog to get used to one person but then it is even harder for a dog to be taken away from its new friend after its gotten used to them!|`|ROoxAojPaa	you and your friend need to let the dog stay in one place until he's older.  you are teaching him to have separation anxiety with all this changing up at his age.|`|MGAmNxddaa	Maybe now that he is older he has "chosen" your house over hers???Or more specifically YOU over her?Maybe she should just come to your house to visit the puppy from here on...|`|DUjr9tNUaa	Buy a shock collar!|`|NqiBLPS0aa	there are two possible problems here. either:<br>  1. your dog is getting to used to being active of the moving, so wants more attention(aka is becoming spoiled) i have a purebred, and when we used to move her back and forth, she never whined, but now she is unbearable to listen to. <br>  solution: pay more attention to him, not like the whole keep your eyes glued, but keep active with him. honestly, the only way you can STOP the whining is to exhaust him, so he has no more energy to whine. You already have him in the habit of moving around so much, so gradually, play with him less and less. it depends on what his personality is like.<br>  2. he misses your girlfriend. if you already have him in the habit, there's nothing that you could do, but maybe see her more.
FeFuIgwCaa	Chop off it's leg and count the rings ... okay that is a lie.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to check the band on it's leg if it has a band.  If not, you can take it to an avian vet.  They may be able to approximate its age by some physical characterisics like the condition of its beak, eye wrinkles, or something else.  As far as I know there really is no way other than just info from owners.|`|0e887501126bed50bff9795d128b616faa	A DNA test will not determine the age of the bird, so don't waste your money.|`|OP0WnHYZaa	contact your local DNA test centre they could help you with a blood feather as a sample.|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	Other than the possible leg band (and tracing the number to the owner and asking them), there really is no way to tell, other than less than a year or over a year. <br>     Some cockatoos can live upwards of 50 years.<br>  A 40 year old bird looks the exact same as a 15 year old one.<br>     In eagles they can tell approximate age by the wrinkliness of the feet, but I have not heard of anyway to age a bird in the cockatoo family.|`|CEgq26oHaa	If she has a leg band on you can usually tell by the date on the band.  One number represents the hatching number, the other the date born.

99iZK5Ixaa	He is marking his territory. You should definately get him neutered. Most of the time that will help but keep in mind there are always the ones that will keep peeing. He probably heard or saw other cats outside and feels the need to mark and defend his territory from those other cats. I suggest odor remover, spraying him with a spray bottle of water (to discourage to bad behavior), and getting him fixed.|`|iGxVGuitaa	he is marking his territory|`|VVSGFDJkaa	If it's an adult cat, they decided the floor didn't smell enough like them. Adult cats mark their teritory. If it's a kitten, it just needs to pee...
hQQuqyYcaa	I wouldn't recommend that you put the two together. Try and keep reptiles with their own species. Green anoles and Bahaman anoles are of the same genus, but not species. I've seen them kept together, yet several of them had their tails bit off, one had a big wound over its back...obvious signs of fighting. When you first get them, it's possible that the anole itself may smell bad if kept in a dirty cage. If you keep the cage clean, the anole should not smell bad at all.
hIAKXlsNaa	First, try and stay calm.  Nothing will get done if you panic :)  If its something that is really bothering your pug then you need to take your baby in to the vet to get the eye checked.  When I read your question, it made me think back to my animals.  A few times now, my dog has had that happen to his eye, same color issue, trying to keep it closed.  What the vet told me to do when I took him in is to hold the dog and flush the eye with cool water.  My dog kept getting a hair in his eye and he was trying to get it out by crying and open and closing his eye.  Of course have him checked if that's what you think is best for your baby.  Good luck and I hope she is fine!!! :^)|`|G6w8Kym4aa	Well she might have like an eye infection! You might have to take her to the vet and have her get some medicine and alls the medicine is is just like rubbing a medincine around the eye everyday.|`|hxBwRt09aa	The eyes can go from bad to worse very quickly. She could have an injury, high pressure (glaucoma), ingrown eyelash, or a bunch of other problems. Only a complete eye exam can determine what is wrong. I would get her into a vet before she loses the eye.|`|4IZHdhJQaa	I don't understand why you wouldn't take her too the vet ASAP, i have pugs and i don't mess with their health! There's nothing you can do at home because you don't know what the problem is, so stop what your doing and please take her too the vet!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|YRTYXfggaa	Sounds like she scratched it or got something in it.  If it is either of these, she needs medical attention from a vet.  The longer you wait, the worse it will get.|`|oSHCPmiqaa	take her to a vet ASAP. I have a pug too,but he doesnt have eye problems yet. I have to watch out for that.
