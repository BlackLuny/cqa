It is not decided in any central office.  It is generally agreed upon by the people in a society.  It may vary between people but generally defines acceptable speech about various things like race, gender, sexual preference, or religion.  It changes from time to time.  For instance, fifty years ago, it was acceptable to call a black person a ***** or colored.  Now the only accepted term is black, or in America, African American.  Or it used to be that the only proper term of address of a female was one that identified them as either single or married, Miss or Mrs.  Now that is no longer required and Ms. is accepted, which does not identify marital status.

OVmzkRTOaa	It shows the power and effectiveness of the propaganda machine!  The Palestinians, who are effectively a nation imprisoned, have been consistently and continuously setup to fail. The Israeli government has ensured the undermining of every agreement by failing to meet all the criteria, for example, the lifting of embargoes on necessary materials and aid. This has led to protest and, bingo, they have the means to present themselves as the victims, over and over again.  You may wish to have a look at this link;  http:// tinyurl .com/brk78r ( remove the spaces to connect, it was the only way I could get the post accepted!)|`|LgKYrup2aa	Well done Steph for trying to point this out.    There have been a number of breaches of the ceasefire by Israel.    The first I saw was when IDF opened fire on some teenagers fishing off the Gaza coast.    Then we learned of Israeli patrols entering the Gaza Strip and hustling residents.    Then there were two men in Gaza shot dead by an Israeli incursion into Gaza.    Then there was the French diplomatic convoy which were fired upon by the IDF when they were in Gaza on Tuesday. ( The Israeli Ambassador was summoned by French foreign office on Wednesday).    Then an Israeli patrol, inside Gaza hit a roadside bomb killing one IDF soldier.    The Israeli response seems to have been a Palestinian farmer was shot dead.    Then a further Israeli response was to pursue a palestinian on a moiped/scooter and shoot at him (wounded not dead).    Then a further Israeli response was to launch a bombing raid above Rafah in the early hours of Wednesday morning.    Gaza broke their ceasefire for the very first time by firing Two rockets through the night which landed in fields.     Israeli Press (hareetz) are reporting that these two rockets were actually fired by Fatah not Hamas.( So in theory Hamas still haven't broken the ceasefire.)    Israeli air Force carried out further bombing raids on Rafah before dawn this morning.|`|ZKRe1Ycbaa	Your question's too long, but your brain's the right way round. Try re-associating the word "Jew" with the Law-exempt Jewish State. They don't like it--and for no reason connected with concern for Diaspora Jews.    EDIT--"Everyone could you please watch the new report..."  OMG--well, NO, they don't WANT to! Not if it's likely to  contradict THEIR version!|`|adznfYe3aa	Because this is what Hamas has done again and again.  Bombs being detonated during a ceasefire is the Hamas way.  Firing thousands of rockets in a ceasefire is the Hamas way.    Why do the desperate try to justify the actions of terrorists? No rockets no retaliation. How difficult is that to understand?|`|udrSvH8Vaa	Becuase Hamas is a terrorist organization who cannot control their own rebel fighters, and they fire rockets over the wall everyday and kill innocent israelis, not that the israelis dont have their share of war crimes, but if Hamas wont stop trying to continue the holocaust, than the Israelis wont have a choice.... How would you feel if a democratically elected terrorist government was elected in your state and they started firing rockets over the border to try to wipe out Canadians, would you still support them?|`|ogLHkR0oaa	Mere propaganda, my dear.|`|tguEmxVyaa	Way to much to read. Youtube is where I go to get the truth on all my news questions..LOL...|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	Here is the deal:  Hamas is a terrorist organization. That fact alone means that they have no credibility. That means that it does not matter who started it, Hamas is at fault since they are the ones who always cause the trouble.|`|midmBgJJaa	Oh, I don't know....maybe because 6,000 rockets since 2005 means "broken ceasefire?" Just a guess.    Being elected doesn't give Hamas the right to kick out Fatah from the West Bank, nor does it entitle them to bomb Israel at will. The current problem was caused by Hamas setting a bomb to kill an Israeli soldiers.    Edit: Please note that each ceasefire is unilateral. Hamas  never met with Israel and vice-versa. Neither side obliged to follow the recommendations of the other - but Hamas should stop attacking for the sake of people living in Gaza.    Double Edit: Interesting, but no. Israeli troops are stationed outside of the borders of Gaza, not within it.|`|WQjk0nRKaa	I suspect the detonation of a roadside bomb was the clue.|`|5RqvVmKaaa	OK, this is only one snippet of newsreel - but if it's correct then it seems that you have a good point.   My guess is that Israel therefore might have attacked Gaza and Hamas with residual anger / pent up anger at the numerous rockets that it was attacked with before as well as the continuing trickle of rocket attacks even after the June ceasfire. So indeed it seems that Israel broke the ceasefire itself. Although one should ask who, if it was not Hamas, was firing the rockets at Israel from inside Gaza between June 18th and November 4th. One could also argue that since rockets still came out of Gaza during the ceasefire then Israel technically did not break the ceasfire because it was still beinig fired at and it did not know who was firing them for sure.   And of course tunnelling activity and smuggling was continuing during that ceasefire period too. Clearly it seems that number 2 was being violated. And clearly number 4 was being violated and was an issue with borders often being closed. In my opinion both sides were still at war games so neither can claim innocence.  Yes, Israel could have played it better by demanding the culprets firing on them be handed over instead of firing on Gaza and going into Gaza. Perhaps Israel did make these demands before going in and then lost patience... Or did the Israeli government want to do something to up its vote in the upcoming Isreali elections?  Or did Israel just have unfinished business and decide that the time before Obama took office would be a good time to damage Hamas?   Democracy has a lot to answer for because those in power can take actions to win electoral support, while those wanting to get into power can only claim that those in power are weak and inert. Now, if Israel went in because those in power thought it would win it electoral support in the upcoming elections then that is a sad indictment on democracy, not an indictment on Israel itself.|`|JmdnlQsHaa	most americans are under the impression that angels exist|`|XTopfG8Taa	it is not an impression, it is the truth.  Hamas set off a road side bomb and now they are going to get their butts kicked again.  Do some research.|`|AA10838998	I would think most people would understand that Israel was totally justified in its actions...what would you do if your next door neighbour kept lobbing bombs into your house...?...|`|My65doewaa	"And ok, if their intentions were to build a tunnel to kidnap a soldier, which is entirely possible, surely an arrest was more suitable than firing missiles into Gaza?"    And how was this arrest to be carried out?  Call up Hamas and ask them to arrest themselves?  Any arrest would have involved sending in the Israeli military, which wouldn't have ended up any better.      There were rocket attacks against Israel before the kidnap attempt.  There was kidnap attempt itself.  There were rocket attacks after the kidnap attempt.    Hamas broke the ceasefire any way you look at it.
f8316b851202bfa29e2b37b5add98d36aa	Big difference between merely saving your life, and making the biggest party in the century, isn't there?  All those guys in New Orleans were waiting for somebody to he'p them, while the Big 0 was offering them the hope of getting all that and a bag of chips, with a six-pack too.  Now there's some he'p that's worth working for.  And, too, if they missed the party, they could hardly claim it was racist or prejudice, could they?  There's the dividing line, right there.  How can there be any question where the biggest effort must go?|`|SlhuFfuZaa	I can't explain why both things happened. I can explain a little of the reasoning behind their choices.  In Katrina, many were afraid to leave their belongings and were basically ignorant in their thinking. So one might call it simply, ignorance!    Those willing to take the chance of extreme cold and possible illness, STUPIDITY!|`|gW0nD5cEaa	Were they the same people who were stuck in New Orleans? I mean, some might have been, but that does not mean all of them were.     I know people who live along a coast where there is a strong threat of hurricanes. They often have false alarms, where there are warnings and either the storm turns and goes another way, or it is much smaller than predicted or things like that. I don't know if that is an excuse to stay and not get out, but there are reasons people of all colors stay in hurricane prone areas and don't flee, even when they should, especially ones who have ridden out previous storms. Others just did not have the financial means. Those people were probably not in Washington.      As for the people who went to Washington, there were people of all colors, and many prepared for months for this. Should people along the coast save up in case of a disaster?, Probably, but this was different and I don't think the two events are related.     If it was this week instead of last, however, most people from the midwest and maybe parts of the South would not be there, because, yes, because of weather, snow, ice, etc.|`|AA11049477	Isn't that called being Forewarned.  People knew when Obama was going to be inaugurated but no-one knew Katrina was going to turn into a killer.........  did they?  But I do see your point.  It would have also helped if it hadn't taken 19 hours to sober up the Commandering-Chief enough to stand in front of the camera & offer his people some much needed reassurance.    But GW was too busy otherwise engaged, getting hammered on his family holiday!|`|AA11226180	I am LMBO that is freaking a very good a funny question !!!  I always wondered why in the world ANY of the people from katrina tragedy didn't get there butts out of there when "WARNED" days and days ahead of time !!  And don't EVEN say "I had no where to go !!"    You didn't have ANYWHERE to stay either and GOING definitely was better than STAYING !!! I would have gotten in my car with my family and drove our butts as far as I could have .That is common freakin sense.  I think people just did not take it serious and then when it happened they want to blame it Bush?? Because he couldn't wiggle his nose and zap them all out of there in an instant ! They were irresponsible to themselves and to their families so stop blaming it on Bush !!    If people really want to do something, they usually find a way ! Your right,how many people "wanted" to go to the inauguration ??? ALL the ones that got there,what ever it took and the same kind of people CHOSE to stay and "FACE" the storm of Katrina and they lost ! And when their plan didn't work, they play the blame game, the poor 'ol me victim game .  Everyone who lost thier lives,their homes and livelyhood from Katrina were victims,thats a fact,BUT the people who could have driven away or gotten rides out of there and "CHOSE" to stay....you brought more trouble on yourself and YOU put yourselves and RESCUERS at bigger risk That was YOUR selfish FAULT.|`|0lV2C78xaa	Crazartgirl, what the heck makes you think everyone here has a car to get out? And yes, the inauguration was planned weeks, if not months in advance, Katrina was not. Some did stay that could have left of course, but for the most part, there was no other option. I do agree on the foolishness however of those who could have left. But please don't insult those who had no other option.    For this, I blame the local government but to blame the victims is a little mean and wrong.    EDIT: Thumbs down? Would ' Those people deserved it' be closer to what you want to hear? How sad.|`|Mui28BI5aa	Now that is what you call an engineering marvel. Seems that motivation  is the key, They cried there eyes out when there own mayor and gov.  didn't respond in time. Blamed it on Bush and his administration. When  all that was needed to be done, Is crank up the school buses and drive  there butts out of the danger zone, But then if that happened, they   couldn't blame anyone, wouldn't be on TV and couldn't rip the government off for the millions they did., Typical,|`|5uZ8wwouaa	That's a good question. I never thought of that. I think it's because many of the people in New Orleans did not follow directions properly or take things seriously.|`|qe0RNp7xaa	RIGHT:  Who's to blame for the loss of life after Hurricane Katrina? Let's see: New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin and Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco failed to implement the city's evacuation plan, then directed residents to emergency shelters without food, water, sanitation or security provided. Nagin also refused to order the emergency evacuation of the city until 19 hours before Katrina hit, while Blanco refused numerous offers from the White House to "federalize" the disaster.     LEFT:  So what you're saying is, the whole thing was Bush's fault.|`|XCn2dK1laa	That is a really good question.wow.|`|mMMJwiL3aa	When Katrina happened those people were trapped and had no transporation or food, etc.    But with the Inauguration people knew way ahead of time and had their own cars, other public transportation, food, water, whatever they needed.
i7oHTo9haa	I can.  I have lots of knowledge about Iran and the Islamic Revolution that started there in 1979.  People that claim Achmedinijad never said "wipe Israel off the map" and that it was a mistranslation are not viewing the whole perspective and just considering limited information.  I have seen Iranian tank in military parade with the slogan "Israel must be wiped off the map." written on it in English shown on Iranian television 22 Sept 2004, that doesn't leave anything left to interpretation.  This was done a year prior to the interpretation controversy of which many people interpreted Achmedinijad's comments to mean just that.    Iran Military Parade  http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/272.htm    Also in the parade was another sign that read "Not even for a moment will we reconcile with America and this is the path we have chosen." Iranian Military Parade 22 Sept 2004    G-d parted the sea as the east wind blew.  There will always be something for naysayers to say "see it isn't so."  Those people are free in their choices and suffer the consequences they make.    There is just overwhelming evidence that shows Iran plans to spread his Islamic Revolution.  He has his whole society regularly chanting "Death to America, Death to Israel" and those clips are too numerous to list. What more does one want?  Slap upside the head and someone to say snap out of it you fool? They have a violent culture, it's spreading and only ignorant  people or accomplices will let something like that spread when it can be contained.    Here's one tape of masses where the Ayatollah is talking about world climate and Islamic revolution, resistance to change and chants Death to America:    Iranian Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami to President-Elect Obama  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTY6czWnG...    And I need to express that while HItler's army was defeated by allied forces and "checkmated" the people that allied with Hitler weren't even "checked."  The Islamic Revolution has the same mindset as Nazism, but with a religious twist.    They are also more dangerous than the Nazis as they have already immigrated to Western societies trying to influence democracy. Seems the terrorists have evolved and developed new strategy while the Western world masses still have not recognized the threat.  Thank G-d our world leaders do because they have more information than the average citizen who is not privvy . So if people don't know what they talking about they need to stay out of it.

After fighting broke out in Gaza, Iran released a symbolic petition signed by 70,000 Iranians who claimed they would become suicide bombers in Israel. I think we need to keep our eye on hem. If Iran was to develop an atomic weapon without the knowledge of the world, all they have to do is hand it over to a terrorist group and gleefully proclaim innocence on the matter.|`|ksOW8Y4Aaa	What threats? One deliberately mistranslated sentence by Ahmadinejad does not constitute a threat no matter how many time it is repeated. Iran has no borders with Israel, no means to attack Israel, utterly no reason to attack Israel, and about 5000 nuclear warhead reasons in American and Israeli hands not to attack Israel. Why can't you acknowledge that the Israeli and USA's governments endless exaggeration of the "threats" they face is ludicrous propaganda coming from the world's first and fourth largest militaries to justify endless military spend and foreign interventions?    Short answer: Because I can think for myself instead of parroting what I hear on Fox or CNN.|`|lPO4D8PLaa	nice... question?  or just more pro-israli propaganda?|`|AA11049477	Since israel has only existed from 1948 onward, a relatively young country AND arabs have lived in & around the Middle East for the passed 4 documented centurys  why don't israel re-locate to somewhere safer?

I know a great many christian arabs & they're not welcome in israel or israeli occupied palestine.  They consider themselves Palestinian, some were born in Jerusalem & are being evicted to make way for jews.

To the asker:    Isn't it hilarious that 'saif' calls it 'israeli propoganda' when all we're doing is stating a FACT?    I happen to know that the representatives of several Arab embassies in London have been approaching their opposite numbers at the Israeli embassy and asking 'when will Israel deal with Iran?'!!!!!!    The Arab nations are very unhappy about Iran and the fact that within a year, less actually, Iran will have nuclear weapons.

AA11440601	To the best of my knowledge, these "bishops" were excommunicated for being ordained as bishops without the Pope's permission which is against both Church Tradition and Church Law.    It is well within the Pope's rights to reconcile with these men if that is what he wishes. Let's hope that these men will lead the SSPX into rightful Church Teachings and Tradition.    The lifting of the excommunication does make make them legitimate bishops not does it mean that the Church agrees with any of their personal opinions. It only means that they can attend Mass and receive the sacraments.    Remember the purpose of excommunication is the correction and redemption of the person who has chosen to separate himself or herself from the Church.

It is alright to leave this question open for debate, as neither side can be right.|`|dhs9QBMoaa	Denying the holocaust is not an act of hatred in itself.  Promoting the holocaust is an act of hatred.  Denials used by known haters of the Jewish people and their culture are usually seen as hatred - and justifiably so in most cases.  In the case of the Vatican and this rogue member of the clergy, the Pope is really walking a nasty tightrope.  It's difficult as the head of a religious organization to distance yourself and your faith from controversial thoughts like these.  If you can accept someone with these thoughts into your fold, then how sympathetic are you to these thoughts?    If someone denied the persecution, torture and murder of thousands of Christians in the pre-Christian Roman Empire, would the Pope accept him - and what would the Roman Catholic world think of any non-Christian groups that supported the idea?    The bottom line is that the holocaust happened, and it really doesn't matter how Hitler tried to exterminate the Jews, Gypsies or any other ethnic group.  The fact that he made attempts to kill so many people is all we need to remember - and detest.|`|XJigtEiKaa	It's simple. You have a right to your own opinion. But you do not have a right to your own facts.    It's one thing to seek accurate information about the holocaust, which might lead to questions that would make many uncomfortable... such as 'how could this stuff have been going on without the knowledge of the german people?', or 'how much did the US and allies know about the death camps?', or, as your question points 'was the Catholic church complicit in the nightmare?' That's fair game. But to just claim that the event never happened, and that Hitler and the German's who helped him were misunderstood good guys... well this goes deep into delusional distortion of reality.|`|0ulKsvXlaa	From Germany.    Contrary to what has been answered, there is plenty of evidence supporting what happened here many years ago.  Proven Nazi documentation, personal eye witnesses by the thousands and so much photographic evidence.  There is also the matter of so many human remains.    No. I'm sorry to say, there is NO DOUBT that mass extermination was indeed perpetrated by the Nazi's upon the Jews, and ANY persons against them.  I have had one customer, who was 83 years old six years ago.  This German woman was forced to work in Bergen-Belsen, because her parents were against the Nazis. Her parents were killed.  Her recollection of events leave no doubt as to what attrocities she witnessed.    The Catholic Church actively conspired with the Nazis during WW2, until this became unpopular.  The Catholic Church aided many ex-Nazis after the war, by helping many escape justice,  assisting their passage to South America.    Why this Church took such actions ? you will have to ask them.  Start your letter "Dear Pope.....    So it doesn't suprise me one iota what they do now.  A "Hitler junge" as Pope, for example !!!!!!|`|IHzv611caa	Well, strictly speaking, "attempts to promote hatred..." is a freedom of speech issue. Violence is another issue altogether, so I'll ignore that for now. Here in America, at least, you have the right to hate. You have the right to be a racist bigot if you so desire. That's what freedom of speech is. I don't necessarily condone it, but it is protected. Attempts to incite violence are not, however. That is one of a few instances where freedom is limited, because you're infringing on the right of others. Opinions, including racism, are protected by the First Amendment.    The denial of the Holocaust is another issue entirely. It's an issue of truth. It's simply the truth that the Holocaust happened. I don't think that there is any legal action that can be taken against that, but it's an issue of truth, not of freedom of speech.|`|abbfc073e28ab01821ab7e59b06f6ebdaa	Well if we are going to point finger we should do it  the right people  lets start by blaming the natzi  first of all because they are the ones who started it all  am against what the pope say they did used gas chamber sometimes people put stuff as they think fits. And no in America there is no freedom of speech  because  the united states is as corrupted as other but they make it seem that there is freedom of speech my ***.

xU7AaQOdaa	I didn't know that there was a Hunting section until your question, so I've just been for a look. There's another guy asking advice on a sawn-off shotgun!

Also, not that I've ever done it, but I would guess the best way to break a ducks neck would be similar to the way you break a chickens.    With a chicken, you grab it by the head and swing it in little circles so that the body twists around the head, thus killing it instantly.

6978689d5750d49479f02abe1bc6a8e8aa	No, the stimulus bill does not include "a provision to give illegals a tax credit," and the article to which you link does not say that it does.  What the article says is that the bill "COULD steer government checks to illegal immigrants, a top Republican congressional official ASSERTED Thursday" [emphasis added].  Let me make this clear:  the article says that a Republican has claimed that some illegals could get checks.      Remember, however, that there are illegals who receive paychecks and who have income taxes and payroll taxes withheld from their paychecks.  At any rate, this whole issue has been blown completely out of proportion.  Even if some people get tax credits who don't deserve them, the vast majority of people who get them will.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Just more welfare, let's completely break America's economic back.|`|gjteVB2Daa	Of course it is not good!

Israel had the most to gain, and considering our country, and moreover, our media, is primarily Zionist, if not only Jewish, then you begin to see how the MOSSAD more than likely had everything to do with it.  Lets not forget Larry Silverstein, a Jew, a Zionist, who owned the Twin Towers.  The buildings, along with 7, were wired to be demolished.  There is no doubt about this, only misinformation.  Particularly by the cousin of Michael Chertoff(another Jew) who wrote the article for Popular Mechanics, denying any demolition was involved.  Wake up America.  ZOG(Zionist Occupational Government) exists, and is sucking your country dry like a vampire does.
Lbulud8raa	All empires fail, and for the same reasons, if one cares to examine the common acts of any empire.    1.  Currency debasement and removal of wealth backing from the monetary system.  Governments hate silver and gold standards.  The Federal reserve Act of 1913 took the US on a path of de-monetising the USD and also allowed this private cartel and the government to systematically steal around 97% of each dollars purchasing power in the last 95 years.  This is the wealth of it's citizenry.  It also removed your constitutional right to either gold and silver money, or 100% backed certificates, redeemable for said bullion.  The Fed Res is secretive, closed and largely unaccountable to the people.  In theory it is overseen by the government, but this is minimal.    2.  Taxation is egregious in modern America, and has got worse.  In 1913 there was little or no tax paid by the average citizen. Now you work half the year for the government, and those taxes provide citizens with few real services: they are squandered on  debt usury and the funding of unaccountable and secretive government agencies and buraeucracies.  The IRS alone is a monstrous tool for keeping citizens under the thumb.The constitutional clause that states levy and collect  income tax was taken away by Roosevelt and never returned.    3.  Rampant and unaccountable public sector spending.  This is partly the fault of society, but governments play a willing hand here beacuse the granting of social welfare programmes allows the government to remove disproportionate amounts of liberties from the people thus increasing control.  The US was the world's largest lender prior to WW2 and became the largest ever debtor, as a total and per capita, less than 25 years later.  The increasing (especially under Regan and the two Bush administrations) deficit spending grants a period of good times followed by a reckoning: the credit crunch is one such reckoning because the Fed Res allowed banks to play in the field of zero Fractional Reserve and sub-prime speculation.  This reflects governmental behaviour of borrowing to live for today.  Items are placed of budget with dazzling regularity.  Originally conceived as a way of allowing funding in times of crisis, off-budget spending is secretive, exclusionary and removed from proper oversight.    4.  Militarism, Jingoism and the co-opting of the language and tenets of patriotism.  The US has needed an ideological enemy since WW2.  It allows for control and removal of freedoms from the people.  The totally illegal actions of the McCarthy years. HUAC, the Senate commitees, the blacklists all speak of tyranny to control based on the premise of an internal threat to the American way of life.  It did nothing to stop Soviet espionage just as the Beriya operations tyrannised Soviet citizenry while allowing the real spies to do their work.  The policies of GWB and legislation like the Patriot Act, Gitmo and co-opted torture and violation of the due process of law at whim all have the same overtones.    The US engages militarily primarily to ensure resource access.  It uses the ideology of spredaing democracy (no doubt believed as a worthy cause as well) as a shield to this aim.    Look at previous empires:    1.  Debased currency.    2.  Increasing regulation, decadence, spending and decreasing accountability    3.  The tendency for the people to be placed in service to The Government, even in a democracy where the opposite is certainly held to be true in words: a government FOR the people.  JFK's idea of "ask what you can do for your country" is a dangerous and damaging one overall: but it does sound patriotic, and therin lies it's strength for this idea to deceive.    4.  The government, and in modern times the citizens too, relying on debt to fund lifestyle and basic needs.    5.  Fractional Reserve Banking.  It destroyed Britain's empire (or contributed heavily).  It was said to be "Conceived in iniquity and borne in sin" by one governor of the Bank of England.  Every new empire thinks it knows better, or is deceived into implemetning it, or brings it in willingly, as a form of monetary control.  .  These are a few ideas.

Since the hearings are a Federal matter, then yes, the taxpayers are held accountable for his travel fees, hotel room, food, lawyer fees, and everything else.

In St. Louis a local reporter tried to get answers about that and he brushed him off, then when he finally answered he was worried how he looked on camera or something.

At the time of UN partition Jews owned less than 7% of the Land of Palestine, and the title to much of that 7% was fraudulently acquired. They were about 30% of the population. Yet this population (of mostly illegal residents) which owned less than 7% of Palestine, were partitioned 55% of Palestine. In that 55% partition, 45% of the inhabitants were Palestinians.     That entire area was known as Palestine -- and even Zionists called it that -- and it belonged to the people there: the natives of that land since even before the Jews first got there in the entire Jewish history, the ones whom the conquering Arabs married into 1400 years ago. Furthermore, Pro-Israeli "Britain owned Palestine" logic confuses jurisdiction with private ownership. The British and Ottomans exercised jurisdiction over Palestine, but Palestinians privately owned the land.     The Zionists ended up capturing not 55% of Palestine, but 78%. In this 78%, there were roughly 900,000 Palestinians. 150,000 were still within what became Israel after the Armistice agreement was signed in 1949 and the green line was drawn, although most of this 150,000 were and continue to be internal refugees who were also driven from their homes and land in 1948 although they remained inside what became Israel.     The Jewish population at the time of the British census in 1931 amounted to 130,000-something. In 1940 the white paper was made into law which limited immigrations to 75,000 Jews from 1940 to 1945 and gave control of immigration to Palestinians after that. From these facts we can gather that the 600,000 Jews in Palestine in 1948 were mostly illegal and recent immigrants and we know for a fact that most of them came during and after World War 2. There were 600,000 Jews in the Jewish partition, with 450,000 Palestinians IN THE JEWISH PARTITION. It was not possible to make a "Jewish state" without ethnic cleansing.     Israel destroyed over 530 Palestinian towns and villages. The refugee crises was created by two factors: a) the Refugees leaving and b) the Refugees not being allowed to return after the fighting. It was Israel and Israel alone who was responsible for their inability to return and their villages were also destroyed for this reason. Golda Meir, one of the founders of Israel, signer of the declaration, and one of the early prime ministers, said: "It is a dreadful thing to see the dead city (Haifa). Next to the port I found children, women, the old, waiting for a way to leave. I entered the houses, there were houses where the coffee and pita bread were left on the table, and I could not avoid that this, indeed, had been the picture in many Jewish towns (in Europe during WWII). Are we prepared to preserve these villages in order that their inhabitants might return, or do we want to wipe out every trace that there had been a village on the site?" Clearly, Zionists chose the latter.     From the 900,000 Palestinians (out of which 750,000 were made refugees) 150,000 Palestinians who ended up staying inside what became Israel have naturally grown into the 1 million that are now called "Arab citizens of Israel". They remained under military law and without citizenship under an apartheid system, but were granted citizenship in 1968.     Ben Gurion (first Prime Minister of Israel) said that a Jewish state could not be made with a 40% Arab minority, and the Zionists began ethnically cleansing Palestinians from 1947 on. In fact, before Israel declared itself a state when the British pulled out on May 14 1948, and only AFTER which Arab countries came to the aid of Palestinians, the Zionists had ALREADY ethnically cleansed over 300,000 out of the 750,000 Palestinians they ultimately made refugees.     "We must expel Arabs and take their places." - David Ben Gurion, 1937, Ben Gurion and the Palestine Arabs, Oxford University Press, 1985.    Benny Morris and Ilan Pappe are two jewish Israeli historians and have both documented in detail land ownership prior to 1948 and concluded what is said above. Norman Finkelstein is an American jewish historian and son of holocaust survivors who also agrees. Avi Shlaim is well-known too. Theodore (Teddy) Katz, Simcha Flapan, Noam Chomsky is Jewish and lived in Israel a few years, and plenty of "new historians", a movement for historical truth in Israel that began in the 1980s, which roughly coincided with the declassification of some archives from 1948, which haven't all been declassified yet.     The fact that Israel is an illegitimate, fascist, terrorist state has also been confirmed by the two great minds of the 20th century: Albert Einstein and Bertrand Russell. http://www.newdemocracyworld.org/Einstei...

What is she a celebrity for?|`|yuBuNoPDaa	Ignore. I don't even bother. I'm not curious anymore. The only time I am interested is if they are doing something for a cause. If it's just about them then I don't even bother. I change the channel or turn the tv off. I go to another article. It is a distraction and a waste of time.     Some might argue that this is the stuff that makes life exciting. But I find it pathetic. It has to do with jerks being the cool way to be these days. Isn't it cool to be a jerk?  I disagree but that is what seems to be selling these days.|`|un0C52G8aa	Why are you criticizing her? She was correct and Bill O'Reilly was wrong. He asked her which country (not countries) were netural during WWIi and she answered Sweden. He told her she was wrong and said it was Switzerland.

Also, do you think the former president Ronald Reagan was a "Hollywood clown"? He was a movie and TV actor before he entered politics. His last acting project was as host on a TV anthology series called "Death Valley Days". He left that show to become governor of California.|`|qz9trhYhaa	Yeah. Most celebrities are stupid.

I wish these people would shut up and make movies/records. I don't even wanna watch Alba act, but I'd rather see her ont he big screen than listen to her open her mouth.

Maybe I need to go pick up a newspaper.    I personally could care less what celebrities have to say but I also don't get angry about it. I am completely indifferent. In my opinion, they can say whatever they want. If you think about, that is what everyone does. We all have our views and ideas on things and we express them. You see it all the time on here. The thing with celebrities is that they have a much larger outlet to express their views. I just choose not to listen. It is sad that so many people put so much merit in the things that celebrities say. Too many people allow celebrities to dictate how they feel about certain issues and that is what bothers me. But other than that, they can say whatever the heck they want.|`|RKMWeMk9aa	Yes I am, and I'm still wondering how Jessica Alba still keeps a job she can't act out of a paperbag!|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	When I was younger, I knew everything going on in Hollywood (yes, lame). Now I know nothing and I love it that way. It's gotten to the point that these celebrities act like they are above the rest of us, even endorsing their political views. Ok, um, let's see-what's your experience? Oh yeah, you did that movie about a talking bug.   Why can't they just be quiet like DeNiro and keep their private life private and be seen on the screen when we want to see them. Love DeNiro-know nothing about his personal life. Perfect.|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	Yes, i agree. Who cares what a bunch of attention seekers have to say? Jessica Alba just wants publicity like the rest of them. She can't act, and her mouth is weird lmao....

Israel actually showed considerable restraint.|`|bYtCfdwbaa	As Israel broke the ceasefire I'd have to say no,also the timing just before elections and in time for Bush's departure was a bit suspect and suggests rockets may not have been the real reason.  Methods? Totally unacceptable.|`|i7oHTo9haa	Just cause, yes. Any nation receiving thousands of rockets from a hostile border wouldn't wait 8 years to do a major strike back.    Incompetent, not in the least.  They had Hamas in Gaza on cell phones begging Meshal in Damascus for another tahdiah (calm.)    Incompetent  because of civilian casualties doesn't work because those  s were highly inflated.  The Hamas police took off their uniforms and wore civilian clothing.    Incompetent as far as getting goals accomplished? Once again no.  The goals set up in the operation were achieved.    Israel just exhibited restraint, if they wanted to they could mow anything down in their path.  That was not the goal.    International law does provide for civilian casualties and destruction, there is no law that says there can be no civilians affected.  In WW2 there were mass casualties.  The benefit to the rest of the people and cause of the war just has to outweigh the destruction. 1 million people in Southern Israel and 1.4 in Gaza show perspective that the benefits greatly outweigh anything else that occured.    Those people were saved and got another chance to make peace.  If they keep it up then they didn't learn their lesson.|`|My65doewaa	Obviously their actions were justified.. and I'm not sure I would call their methods incompetent.

Hate taught from childhood and a belief that they are right and everyone else is wrong will not easily be changed. Education is lacking and if they are taught hatred by their religious clerics what hope is there for them?

AA11114869	First, - let me state that I have nothing against Bill O'Reilly or Jessica Alba...    As I understand it, Alba did not quote O'Reilly directly; he didn't call Jessica Alba 'dumb',... he called her 'misinformed'.  This may seem to most like a semantic argument but those words have significantly different meanings. One who would use the word 'dumb' in place of the word 'misinformed' is misinformed as to the accuracy of their definitions and, as such, - one may open themselves up to being quickly labeled as 'dumb', 'stupid', 'moronic', etc...    That said,... if Alba had just simply kept her mouth shut when she was called on the "be neutral, be Sweden" comment then all would have been quickly forgotten.    But no,... she wouldn't have any of that.    Instead, she posted yet more questionable commentary on the subject, even going so far as to prove (or, more correctly, - disprove) her academic prowess by posting a link to, of all sites, ... Wikipedia; a site which, even recently, has been plagued with rogue edits to its articles.  And yes, I, like 6 million other people per day, use Wikipedia from time to time. However, were anyone to question the validity of any piece of information I propose as being a fact, - I certainly wouldn't use Wiki as the only resource to back my facts up.    One wonders whether Alba, as well as the plethora of other pseudointellectual entertainers of her ilk, will ever realize that the public, in general, would much rather pay to have them entertain us than to have to hear, pro bono, their oft-misinformed social and political commentaries.    I, for one, seriously doubt it...  -|`|w2df2WMXaa	Well you have to remember Mr. Oreilly doesn't comprehend things like me and you would.

vYSA8Ppxaa	this is more of an essay question.  i couldn't even begin to tell you how much the media has affected my generation.  i'd say media has much more of a negative impact on my generation than it does a positive.    it gives people a false sense of reality and misinformation on many levels.  it seems to teach youth things like:    -money is easy  -women are easy  -it's cool to be a gangster  -a whole bunch of racial slurs and stereotypes    the list goes on.  there is some good, but channels/shows like mtv, to reality shows, to american idol, to the list goes on just seem to exemplify how dependent american society is on things we shouldn't concern ourselves with.  it's essentially all entertainment with very little fact.  that's a big reason why our culture is dumbing down if you will.    very few americans in my generation can even tell you how our govenment works, who their state and local officials/representatives are, and barely know where other countries are on a globe.    it's kind of depressing when you think about it...

a04d8ba01741e52edd70eed372868226aa	Rush Limbaugh is pretty paranoid about these things.    At various times, he has suggested to his audience that there are Seminars where people go to learn how to get on the show. Then, whenever he gets a call that doesn't go as he thinks it should, he declares that the caller was a "Seminar Caller."    If people want to try to mess him up, there are lots of challenges.    First, it is very difficult to get a call through. It is a national show, and he takes surprisingly few callers (perhaps twenty?)    Second, you do have to get through the call screeners. While this is possible, the fact is they are experienced at screening callers, and most of us are inexperienced callers. In all likelihood, most pranksters would get dropped.    Third, there is the wait. Many callers are put on hold and need to wait for the time when Limbaugh and/or others on the show decide their call will benefit Limbaugh. It's been said on the show that people sometimes wait for hours.    And finally, Limbaugh knows what he is doing, and is very good at using the Mute button and the broadcast delay. Only very subtle tricks will likely get through.    On the other hand, since Limbaugh lost his hearing, he has slipped a few times, either misunderstanding callers, or not being able to understand them at all.    Seems to me a prankster is possible, but extremely difficult.|`|4bf562ccbf266e504b30ac04a5e0a34aaa	People like Rush, it is best to ignore.  That is what I choose to do.

These are called additional first tier benefits.     If they live in a state with an unemployment rate of 6 percent or above (over a three month period), workers are eligible for an additional 13 weeks of second tier benefits.  http://www.unemployedworkers.org/extend_...  http://www.unemployedworkers.org/  http://appropriations.house.gov/pdf/Pres...  You are guaranteed to recieve up to 20 weeks of first tier EUC benefits. If you remain unemployed after receiving 20 weeks of extended benefits, and at that time you live in a high unemployment state that is triggered on to the second tier benefits, you can receive a second tier of up to 13 weeks of benefits.

Fundamentally its even worse and we now lack industry and manufacturing in this country that could employ people.  So this will hurt more people more deeply, with more problems to come.  The only bright spot is that for most people, their bank savings will not be lost as in the Great Depression.  But a huge change in our lives is going to happen, and we may never see the days of easy credit again.  We will have to learn that not everyone can afford everything, the lines between rich and poor will be stark.  With no pattern to follow no one individual will be able to help an economy that was built on air in the first place.  No president can change the mess that encouraged this in the first place.  Lets just make sure we don't ask Bush and the Republicans for hints on how to make better what they took apart.

JiATH6rGaa	You do bring up a good point. I feel that if you weren't inclined to violence it would be easier to pull a trigger rather than kill someone in another manner requiring a more intimate interaction or requiring a repeated action.     You pull the trigger and the bullet doesn't come back... If you were to hit someone or stab someone for example you may not repeat the action again so easily.     However... If you're caught in a moment where you can do that maybe it's too late. Maybe you could in fact repeat a violent action. You could argue that if the decision was made it would have been carried out with whatever means neccesary.     This is totally circumstantial... as almost everything is. It's scary to think that people that absolutely should not have guns can obtain them so easily. But I'd like to have one for my own protection some day. I'd prefer that they not be banned... Maybe because I'm naive enough to think that I can better control a situation with one. I'd hope that I would have a better chance of defending myself, my family, and others. Guns are convenient and effective... but it goes both ways.     ---     To the response below it's pretty simple to become a security gaurd. And aside from the someone in a perfect mindset can step for one reason or another. Some really great people can be really bad under stress.|`|DgLBtjWoaa	No, because I'm sure the man had kitchen knives.     I'm a Yank living in England where they've outlawed guns... and sure, there are fewer shootings, but instead knife crime has skyrocketed. Criminals just find other things to abuse the public with. Several years ago there was a brawl at a pub near my house and one gentleman beat another to death with a brick. A brick!     Outlaw guns and they'll just get more creative with their weapons.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	It would seem that to a 16 year old gang-banger, yes.    To me, a gun is an effective way of defending myself and my family. It is also something to enjoy shooting for fun and if needed, put food ont he table (I own 75 acres in rural NC).     It is also something that, if needed, I can use to defend my country from all enemies both foreign and domestic.    As for the easy way out, isn't that what we are asking from our government more and more??    We don't want to handle our own financial affairs, we want the Government to pay for our homes. We want the Government to pay for our school. We want the Government to pay for our Health Care, We want the Government to RUN our Health Care. We already have the Government run our schools, tell us who we have to hire, how much we have to pay them, what benefits we have to give them, when we can and can't fire them, what medication we can or can't use, what we are allowed to build on our own property, how it is to be built. They tell companies what they are allowed to make, what they can make it out of, how it is to be manufactured, and now what it should be sold for and even who they can sell it to.    What ever happened to the concept of personal responsibility?|`|WwRKKAOBaa	If all the human race had was blunt objects, then that is what we would use to kill each other. Do guns make it easier? Only if you are too far away to bludgeon them.|`|339593f4c4dfbe655416ef8e568866fbaa	I think the guy was sick.  So if he wanted to kill himself and his family, he would have found a way.

Guess they don't do psych testing on security guard applicants.|`|cp7regataa	No, when a person wants to commit suicide he/she will devise ways to do it whether it is by gun pills drive off a cliff etc.    He had a co conspirator with his wife so they both must have been clinically depressed to end their family...it is very disturbing|`|7c6a4c897130f7c3fc309fad2d122efcaa	I hunt so I have guns but I keep all the ammo separated from the guns at all times except when I am hunting.  I'm the only one in the house who knows where it is.  Yes, I think guns in the homes of troubled people and people prone to rash actions can become a dangerous impulse item.  The thing is - it's hard for a person who is depressed to realize that they are not in their right mind.  Possibly the lack of a weapon in this case (the California family) would have given the man time to change his mind.  Or maybe he would have piled the family into the car and driven off a cliff.  Who knows?|`|umrXBkeMaa	What?  Would you prefer chemical weapons?  Take away guns and it will only cause people to get a lot more creative.  Chemical weapons are just an example.  We have easy access to thousands of household chemicals that, with a little knowledge, could be turned into far more deadly weapons than any single bullet.      And there are plenty of web sites with blueprints for improvised weapons (saw blade launchers, coffee mate flamethrowers, etc.) that really work.  No one bothers because it's easier to just get a gun.      I really don't think we want to go down that road.  But make it their only choice and people will get creative.  Human history is loaded with far more horrific weapons than guns ever were.  If anything, guns actually allow us to kill in a more "civilized" manner.    Listen, if this fellow didn't have a gun, he would have slit their throats or bashed their heads in with a bat or set the house on fire and let them all burn to death.  Not that it was right -- don't misunderstand me -- but frankly, if he was going to kill everyone, a bullet was the most humane way to go.|`|oIhsJzjVaa	Works for ISrael|`|CCmYhBKiaa	I do not believe that guns offer an easy way out. I think suicide offers an easy way out. I read the news article about the family in California, and in the letter he faxed to the news station said that his wife decided that it was best if they end their lives and the lives of their children so they would not have to be left with anyone else. BUT, if the wife also thought it was a good idea, then why not write the letter from both of them, instead of him alone.     People get pushed to the limit and instead of fighting back the right way, they bail out on themselves, their loved ones, and others who are involved.

V2pcPDA5aa	i read somewehere in a news artical that the family were trying to get their children into a daycare and needed to report how much money they made. in actuallity they were both making around $40 an hour each but on there report it said that they made only about $7-8. and they needed to provide a number to check the source to see if it was correct and so the daycare called kiser and thats when they found out about the fruad and had been investigated since december. they were fired for fruad. im sure that this began to be stressful upon the parents, not having any source of income to provide for the family, but i feel that the incident was due to lack of hope. i hope this helps.......|`|DtkLsetkaa	Only reason I saw listed was that he lost his job, its all still pretty new, I am sure the nighttime news shows will have a little more insight as they learn more.|`|tguEmxVyaa	He lost his job at Kaiser and a supervisor told him to blow his brains out..|`|i7oHTo9haa	I haven't heard that.  But I've seen alot of reports people resorting to violence because they can't handle the economy.  If anyone gets depressed about it (i don't blame them as it is severe downturn and stressful) they need to seek medical help.  Anti-depressants work well and that is what the doctors are there for.  Economy downturn is temporary and survivable, but death is permanent.    I used to live in Long Beach (next to Wilmington) That's tough territory I'd hate to be stuck there with no employment.  Maybe he could have gone on to bring his family to live with the rest of his, or her, family.  In great depression families teamed up together my grandmother had to walk miles to get rice to feed my mother.|`|AA11065140	From what I read, it appears that besides having lost their jobs, a manager at their employment site made some unfortunate comments.  He/she apparently told one of them that they should not have come in to the office, but instead "Shoulda blown your heads off".    Additionally, my understanding is that they both believed that it would not be right to leave the children behind.  They didn't want the kids to deal with the pain of losing their parents, and didn't want anyone else to be burdened with raising them.    IMO, none of what I see is valid reason to kill one's self, let alone one's entire family.  I understand the desperation, but I can't understand their response to it.
o9wc604Gaa	There is no such loophole my friend.  It states clearly in the 22nd amendment to the Constitution of the United States that.....    "No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once."    I hope that helps!!|`|Gf2tzg5jaa	the absolute longest a person can serve as president is 10 years, and that can only happen if the vice president takes office with in the last 2 years of the dead president he took over for and then got him self elected 2 more times|`|uJhrqJCDaa	Yes. Its called an election to a second term in office.|`|6978689d5750d49479f02abe1bc6a8e8aa	Obama has not been talking about this, and I seriously doubt that you "have been hearing a lot of talk" about this, either, unless you spend a lot of time on right-wing websites or listening to talk radio.  This is the first I've heard about any such thing, and I keep up with the news.  There is no "loophole" that will allow Obama to "extend his term" beyond the constitutionally prescribed eight years.  It is possible to serve longer than eight years, as someone else here pointed out, but only if you took over for someone else to finish out his term, as Johnson did when Kennedy was assassinated, for instance.  But you can only serve eight years as an elected president.

Changing the name of something doesn't change the connotation. It only forces lots of costly and stupid changes on people and often takes much longer to say the same derogatory thing. It is the attitude and or the actions of the group described which more often than not is the problem and changing the name without changing the group or the perception of the group is not going to help.|`|z9UFKK5saa	you know why its being forced down our throats, today is the big vote on the scottish budget, now does that explain it.

That's a lie and that person is an idiot. The article clearly states that it increases their production by 500 pints per year. That's an extra 62.5 gallons per year. Now you just have to figure out exactly how much TLC is required for this increase and how much to you have to pay the worker to give that much TLC. You might find that it costs more to pay the worker since you probably have to pay someone an extra $500 for their time and you only get 62.5 more gallons. A gallon might be $4 at the store which would give you an extra $250 in milk sales. It's not worth it.

AA12137001	This is a VERY contentious issue.    I know of an RUC widow who received just 250 compensation after her husband was murdered by the IRA over 25 years ago.    I feel that 12k is an insult on the value of a human life. This whole exercise is an attempt for some people to feel good about themselves "salving" the physical and emotional wounds inflicted on the families and victims of 'The Troubles'. Well, wake up and smell the coffee, you cannot do that. No amount of money will bring them back or restore them to full health. What were you people thinking?    No wait, you WEREN'T thinking...    The greatest and most despicable insult is that the families of paramilitary terrorists can expect the same compensation as innocent victims.    Checking official figures, 3523 people died during the troubles. Paramilitaries made up 15% of that number. 6.5 million pounds will be given to the families of those who caused the suffering in the first place. Disgraceful.    The whole 42.3 million could be put to better use providing financial support for the victim support groups and bereavement organisations who continue to deal with the survivors of these atrocities.    'The Troubles' may be over but the nightmares continue for far too many.    I begrudge any compensation to those who ever supported terrorist violence directly or indirectly. Shame on you!    I wonder how the Government and the Assembly are going to insult us all next?|`|AA11749444	We need to remember that the terrorists from both sides were the people who perpetrated these years of evil on the people of Northern Ireland.  For them (posthumously) or their families to get any payout is abhorrent.  It may not be designed to be compensation, but that is only changing words.  It is a payout for crime.  The terrorists and their supporters (even their families) should be made to live with the shame of these evil deeds to the grave.|`|368008361e77a77ceeb8c70a92a3c2b8aa	no...the innocent victims of these bombs should have their families compensated.      those who perpetrated the crimes should not receive a single penny....they died it's true...but that's the price you pay when you explode bombs & kill innocent civilians.|`|AA11015890	I know that the families of Terrorists lost people they loved, but it beggars belief that the lives of these people could be worth compensation.  Victims of their atrocities are the only ones morally entitled to anything.|`|3jGGzCUJaa	No....victims were on both sides & unless its going to be fair which it wont it should be just a dropped issue. You can't reward law breakers & most of those hurt in some way or another leaned to one side or the other. Look at Hamas they complaint about civilians yet target civilian Isrealis directly & openly while the Hamas leaders hide & live in apartment buildings & use churchs as hide outs & to store weapons all among civilians. So how can you compesate a palestinian killed by accident for living in the same building as a openly Hostile hamas leader does while at the same time reward a family for blowing up a school bus of jewish children across from a border crossing ? One was an accident in the name of a war while the other was a direct act of war against non military personal who happened to be easier targets because the military especially in isreal expects periodic attacks as does Hamas. Neither side is above accidents or events but again if you get hit with a bottle & throw it back at who you think hit you with it but instead hit someone else who's fault is that & who should pay you? or the person who throw the bottle hitting you in the first place leading you to throw it back? neither act was right but your act likely wouldnt have happened or been necassarily if you hadnt been hit in the first place so the start of the issue was the fault of the person who throw the bottle first but good luck on getting them to pay let alone pay for you & the person you hit.|`|twdXT5wOaa	I'm puzzled by the thinking behind this, unless it is that every life lost is that of someone's loved one, and that has to be applauded at least.    12000 is not a lot in this day and age, so it's actually rather a notional gesture.    Arguably it might be better spent on job creation in some of the worst employment blackspots of Northern Ireland.
3AXlgGgUaa	I think people receiving money for being effected by a tragedy is wrong at all.    People lose a member of their family all the time and very few receive any compensation - a life is a life.    No one is supposed to prosper from death.

Alter Ego - You are an Idiot, you clearly don't know what you are talking about, the British army and the RUC where definitely not imparshal and this has been proven in the "Stevens inquiry" which proved the RUC where in collusion with Loyalist terrorists, and both they and the British army had a shoot to kill policy, and murdered a lot of innocent people.|`|860b84a941e4c725c9f29f2f5830cc9faa	The Government are considering proposals that have been put forward by an independent consultative committee.They are not at this moment paying out money to anyone and I very much doubt if they ever will.|`|LIpCGz4oaa	this government thinks our pockets are bottomless pits full of money. to give away wherever they think,  to make themselves look good. when will they see that it doesnt work?|`|61f6e6f435d7885eb7d1dfffa67bff6daa	They make me sick.|`|lCW3Worpaa	Mind posting a link(s) so we can read more about what you're on about?

Gh6ep5O7aa	what?  is media like journalism?
i7oHTo9haa	What any of our American presidents did does not reflect on US-Iranian relations.    Iran is rogue and isn't affected by anything the West does or anything else that happens in Middle East.  They are the spearhead of the Islamic Revolution and they have their own agenda and nothing else will influence them.    The only thing our Presidents did was to counteract it with moderate nations in the Middle East.  You remember Bush holding hands with the Saudis?  We developed relations with the moderate nations. Besides the Saudis we have other allies there and maybe you can focus on that, to counteract that end times revolution that Achmed. is building.    Even the moderates in Middle East DETEST Iran.  And nothing is going to stop Achmedinijad unless we all gang up on him and stop him ourselves.  No nukes for Achmed... he's going to make a suicide bomber out of them and fight another proxy war.    Trying to say that we influenced Iran is like saying one can argue with a drunk.  One can't ever reason with an unreasonable person they just have their own mindset and agenda.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	Good for you.|`|AA11600186	what exactly is your question?

Would you like the war to start up again? Would you like to spend millions on keeping troops in Northern Ireland to keep the warring communities apart? Cos I wouldn't.    This money is part of a peace and reconciliation process that will eventually lead to an amnesty process for all terrorists. In return for this amnesty the former terrorists will have to confess to all their crimes and tell the grieving families what happened to their loved ones.     This will bring some form of closure to a terrible time in Northern Ireland. I share most peoples distaste for giving money to terrorists but if we want to see a continuing peaceful Northern Ireland we have to continue the peace and reconciliation process.|`|ZKXo8RK8aa	I don't think that the government should accept this particular proposal,in fact the only proposal of the consultative group  that I did agree with was that they didn't propose an amnesty for crimes committed during the conflict.

What is really going on is a very costly occupation of that country where service members are doing multiple tours because there is no draft and not enough new people joining up to replace them. I will say that doing multiple tours like this is something unique to this particular military conflict. During the Vietnam war, when there was a draft, people were free to leave the military as soon as their stints were up. Those who served multiple tours there generally volunteered. Now, you hear about soldiers on their fifth or even sixth tours over there. No wonder so many marriages have been destroyed and that there have been cases of multiple murders in heavily military communities like Ft. Bragg, NC. Many of these people are seriously damaged both emotionally and psychologically and they aren't going to get the help they need. They'll be cast aside and forgotten about, just like what happened with veterans of other wars.|`|oIhsJzjVaa	George Bush made decisions,  ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha|`|AdIrjmV7aa	No.  The the people of Iraq have been fighting wars for over 5,000 years.

I think the longer our troops are there, the more enemies we make.|`|AA11437439	i think the west ought to save their money and let them fight it out themselves    other than protecting israel i think that iran/iraq ought to be left to get on with it without it costing the western tax payer an arm and a leg for zero gratitude in return|`|T1a5muvHaa	iraq war was a wrong decision  justice is by leaving every country controlling it self by its people who will gain its benefits or losses  stop wars..stop invasions!!|`|59b9f44cc97529e1ff460f8518e5b3f9aa	There is no war in Iraq.  The war ended years ago.  What is going on in Iraq is called an occupation.    So there should not be a war going on in Iraq, unless it is a war against terrorism.    It's difficult to decide when to end a war on things that are unquantifiable such as terror or fear.  You could perpetuate such conflicts for as long as you like and for whatever reasons that may suit you.|`|Gf2tzg5jaa	what War? there has never been a War in Iraq.  it is an Occupation by definition.      i think people forgot what War was really like.  not to worry, this so called "War" has barely even begun. War will come soon. Very Soon. Then the World will Know what War is, for the weapons are more powerful and people are fighting for God, Land, and Oil.  all 3 top reasons for wars to ever happen, this will be the War of all Wars.|`|PG7WfGpHaa	It is not still going on.  The Iraq war was one of the quickest in history.  If you mean should there still be a foreign military presence in Iraq assisting in counter-insurgency, that is being folded up as planned.

Any type of bailout is one of the worst things USA has ever done....  It changes the way our country works! And will perm ruin it if we keep adding more money and more groups.    It is very sad when ACORN is getting money, and people from PORN movies are asking for money now...  I am ready to get in life and ask for a few grand so i can buy a car so i can get to work.  Not really, i will keep riding my bike 10 miles everyday to work in this freezing weather, cause i WORK for a living, i don't put out my hand crying for money.|`|gRfqjemmaa	ACORN is Obama's pet organization. Remember he was a community organiser, working with ACORN during his rise to power. They were a major stepping stone for him. ACORN worked in every state, to help get Obama elected. Much of this work was dubious, actually they are under investigation, or were, for massive voter fraud, fixing ballots, recruiting people to vote, people registering hundreds of times with different names, etc. Obama uses ACORN to get what he wants, under the table so to speak. The tax payers have been paying them to do this for years, now he is in power, and a majority liberal congress and senate, they are just running downtown to spend YOUR money!|`|f32fab1eea4e11e137dd528a9ce02f4faa	Obama is rewarding the people who broke laws to get votes for him.|`|zQiYKgMLaa	isn't it painfully obvious?  Obama is just another typical slimey politician.  He's just a better marketer than most.  Obama's ties to ACORN have been WELL documented.|`|iwIKK2nEaa	ACORN helped get him elected.|`|2szs8zp5aa	Because they got him elected....I scratch your back, you scratch mine. Or in Acorn's case, I get fraudulent votes for you, you pay my bills.|`|bMPLmeROaa	they AREN'T in the stimulus package. this is just a republican trick, and a lot of people are obviously falling for it. ACORN IS NOT IN THE PACKAGE. good grief people, stop watching faux news.    the article published by fox news, for example, says He said the money was previously limited to state and local governments, but that Democrats now want part of it to be available to non-profit entities. That means groups like ACORN would be eligible for a portion of the funds. he being Boehner.    well gee, some of the money might be available to nonprofits. acorn is a nonprofit, so theres a chance they could be eligible for some of the money. so obviously they want the money to go to acorn to pay them off.   the bill and melinda gates foundation is a nonprofit.   so is amnesty international.   habitat for humanity.   the red cross.   unesco.    hmm if i wanted to tick off a bunch of republicans, which one could i select and (without a shred of direct evidence) link to the stimulus package? ill take acorn for $1,000, Alex....    now ken spain is saying they're getting $4.19 billion. guess what? they aren't! that money he's referring to is set aside for non-profit housing developers to help purchase, rehab, and resell foreclosed properties. ACORN isn't eligible for any of it.
ACIp8lZqaa	Never thought about it. I see your point.|`|CmG8oTH0aa	Yes.  I did know that.  You can't create an new standard that will alienate a large portion of the public.  example:  the government can't all of the sudden decide that gas is obsolete and decree that all gas stations MUST switch to hydrogen fuel without providing the public with the opportunity or tools to be prepared for it.      On another note, why would you want to stifle technology's advancement?|`|T024qfKZaa	This was set up during bush's administration.    Next?|`|gRfqjemmaa	You haven't seen anything yet partner. Just wait until they really get going, you will be paying, and paying, and paying. What about the condom issue, Nancy P. wants this, but I am not sure if they will keep it in there. Everything the Dems have ever wanted is being unleashed, like flood gates opening. Absolutely amazing, in this economy, to even be thinking of all this crap.|`|8552a4e84a403e597110d3e39aa0659eaa	This was not set up during the Bush admin. It started many years before that with the introduction of Cable television. Just follow the money. The television industry, in particular news media-primarily "liberal" owned and operated, has the majority of politicians by the cajones. This, in turn, has caused the government to pour tons of money to them, vying for the most preferential treatment by those same stations. This is definately another step towards socialism. Do not be too surprised if in the very near future, any news program, talk show or other program that conflicts with the communist/socialist movement being wrought on the American people, doesn't end up being removed from the air. A prime example being what is being propsed against the conservative radio talk show hosts now.|`|AA11442722	I'm guessing the justification is that the Gov mandated the changes which has rendered those TVs obsolete.     The reality is that TV is the central source of propoganda. Those same people liberated from network TV might actually read a newspaper, get on the internet, talk to live human beings and thus control would be diminished on them. Especially if they lord forbid read a book.     Personally I'd rather see broadcast TV ended anyway. It's just advertising out there in space that we are here at a time when we couldn't drive off anything that could get here. So we are helpless and bleating out to the universe here we are. The bandwidth would be better applied to other tasks anyway. Sattalite and Cable offer wider selection, more control and don't bombard the whole universe with our bleatings. Who knows, maybe the aliens in Independence day were not here to conquer the Earth, just here to shut us up LOL.  Energy wise broadcast TV is a huge gaping sore. It takes huge amounts of power, creates lots of toxic waste because of the specilized equiptment necessary and all of this for such a tiny proportion of the population? Cable and Sattalite are much greener ways of doing the same thing requiring a fraction of the resources to accomplish the same thing. Especially sattilite where there is no cables run to your home. But at least with cable that bandwidth is used for internet and sometimes even phone. Broadcast is just that. Huge amounts of energy and resources for what? The latest propoganda show? Bah end broadcast period. Digital or not.|`|A4Wfndxoaa	Americans would riot if they didn't have TV.|`|AT1CPDGRaa	I believe that you should stop thinking of the United States as a Company and start thinking of it as a Country. This Country did not start out as everyone for themselves. Sadly this has become the attitude of too many people in its most influential positions of power. How is that working out for us?
yZ1VioWvaa	Yeah sure it`s possible. Alligators are not finicky as to what kind of meat they eat....And thousands of children & adults are missing each year and never get found.Could be part of a dead body, or could be person was killed by alligator. Way back when Mafia wanted to whack out someone without a trace, they would take him to everglades swamp whack him, and let `gators get rid of all evidence.|`|gRfqjemmaa	First of all, you are talking about two different reptiles. Crocodiles are not indigenous to Florida, so it was probably an alligator. And yes, they do eat humans occasionally. Dogs, cats, sheep, pigs, cattle, and once in awhile, dumb humans, possibly like yourself, that were unaware alligators eat whatever they can catch.|`|AA10283080	Was it an alligator or crocodile?    Jeez...a thumbs down for asking which species it is.....how is asking to specify species difference cruel?    There are some uptight people around.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	quite possibly but it had better be an aligator because those crocs are on the endangeredspecies list. and apparently only live in a  nuclear waste water facility

Need to convince people to start spending money again to prevent it.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	Depends on how much stimulus there is. Too much stimulus will cause an already wildly fluctuating economy to fluctuate even more wildly and make the current recession a great recession.    The key will be the weather this summer. Dust bowl drought, as is being experienced in Australia, would really be depressing and would be the final nail in the coffin.
