Che top player del calibro di Henry vengano convinti da Domenech a scendere in campo a Parigi per perdere e fare un dispetto all'Italia? Che nel calcio esistano risultati scontati (e proprio nel girone dove i campioni del mondo in carica si guastano i giochi per via di un pareggio contro la Lituania e superano con uno stentato 2-1 le ISOLE FAR OER???).   Sinceramente, dopo questa vittoria strepitosa dei ragazzini georgiani, non scoprite che il calcio è molto più bello di quanto pensaste fino a ieri?

20070914115231AA6GUg3	Sports;Fantasy Sports	Which WR should I start for week 2?	My WRs are Reggie Brown (vs Was), Torry Holt (vs i dont care, i'm starting him), Calvin Johnson (vs Vikings), and Marques Colston (vs TB).      I start 2 WR and on RB/WR flex, but my RBs are poor so I'm definitely starting 3 WRs.  My first instincts tell me Colston and Johnson.  Colston seems like he'll be consistent, especially against a very poor TB pass defense that allowed so many TDs through the air last year.  I chose Johnson over brown because I know the Lions will be tossing all game against the Vike's stellar run D.  Also, the Vikes pass d is subpar at best.        But then I look at Reggie Brown against the Redskins and decide that's a great matchup too.  Am I making the right choice?  In the end I feel like no matter how much I analyze this, I wont get a clear cut answer and it will all just rely on luck of the game.

E' morto un ragazzo mentre stava in macchina ed a quanto pare sembra che stesse dormendo, che poi avesse la scialpa della lazio e stesse andando a vedere la partita poco importa. Se questo ragazzo invece di andare alla partita mettiamo si fosse messo in viaggio per andare a votare, per esempio (ce ne sono tante di persone che per lavoro si trovano in un posto diverso da quello di residenza), allora che cosa diremmo che visto che si stava recando a votare allora sono stati quelli del partito opposto che hanno organizzato tutto questo, è che si è trattato di un colpo di stato?

20081004103403AA96DB7	Sports;Fantasy Sports	Start Pats D or Packers D?	Pats play the 49ers, Packers play the Falcons.      The Packers are still without Bigby and Harris and are succeptible to the run, which is exactly what the falcons do.  It also doesn't help that I have to start Roddy White on my team, and I hate those double edged sword situations.      The Pats did HORRIBLE against Miami, but with a BYE week or two weeks to prepare for SF, I'm sure Bill worked on a lot of things to shutdown SF. I mean, the Saints Defense got 6 sacks, 2 INTs, and 1 fumble recovery, and they are definitely not as good a unit as the Pats.      So... who to pick and why.

Who to start and why?      Some bad matchups I know, 
20080926094505AA4GEra	Sports;Fantasy Sports	RB/WR to start for week 4?	I'm starting Chris Perry (good matchup) and Brandon Marshall for sure. The rest I'm not sure about. I need one more WR, RB, and a RB/WR flex.      Chris Johnson vs MIN   Thomas Jones vs ARI   Jerricho Cotcherry vs ARI   Roddy White vs CAR      I didn't like Johnson at first since he was playing MIN, but Lendale is hurt so Chris will get most of the carries probably. Even against a tough D, the Titans will run it, so Chris could do surprisingly well. Oh, he can catch too.      I'm thinking Thomas Jones will be my other RB. Hard to sit him.      Cotcherry had 12 targets for 10 catches last week. It'd be hard for me to sit him as well.      Roddy did well last week, but rookie QBs are always inconsistent. And I can't expect 70 yard bomb TDs every week. Not so sure about this one.      So my toughest choice it seems is between Roddy and Chris.

In quella partita secondo me l'Inter ha RUBATO: il rigore su Cruz non c'era e è stato negato un rigore evidente a Locatelli. Volevo sapere da qualcuno quanti di questi 6 rigori sono arrivati sullo 0 a 0, permettendo all'Inter di sbloccare il risultato, e se pensate anche voi, come me, che l'Inter sta RUBANDO e che viene sempre favorita (es.

20090305062144AA1ih7z	Sports;Basketball	Why do Bryant fans deny that Lebron is a better player than Kobe?	I think only in outside and foul shooting is bryant much better.   However Lebron is a better finisher while being fouled and a better inside scorer.   While I think Kobe is a slightly better man to man defender than Lebron he is not as capable as getting steals and blocks like Lebron.  I also dont see him challenging great scorers and instead guarding mediocre scorers like rajon rondo instead of ray allen last year.      Lebron is a much better passer and the fact that every year he has had more assists per game shows that fact.  I think Lebron could easily get 8.5-10 assists a game if he had a dominant inside scoring threat like stoudemire or dwight howard.        He is also a better rebounder.      Also people forget that Lebron Cavs had the closest chance of defeating the celtics last year losing by 5 points in game 7 whereas kobe bryant lakers lost miserably in game 6 and that he could not hit a shot to maintain the 24 point laker lead to seal the game that he had in game 4.

Knowing that the motorcycle had a nail in the front tire; they would probably have to take it in to get fixed, so I visited every motorcycle shop within a five mile Radius of my house to give them a heads up on the stolen bike. they were all pretty open to help me out. I have searched the whole neighborhood. One neighbor said she thought she saw it in the back of a pick-up truck and gave me the licence plate number; I'm not sure how to run a plate? Is there anything I'm missing?  I feel helpless; I'm not sure the police have time to look for it. maybe they will stumble upon it. I feel guilty; It's my fault I know!!

They say it's a combination of accomplishment on the whatever surface or arena these athletes perform and off the field buzz. I find myself not agreeing with a lot of these picks. I don't feel like the fans should be able to pick and I think they should go into even more detail about what it means to be "NOW"! Because...      when I look at now I would think Shaq is on the downside of his career, often injured and might not be able to regain much of his lost dominance, I would've picked Phelps over him.      For A-rod and Kobe Bryant I think that could kind of go either way, but as far as accomplishments A-Rod hasn't done much of anything. when is the last time he won MVP? He will this year but still. A-rod has no world series and Bryant has three. Kobe has had accomplishments, but a-rod chocks in the playoffs. All the analysist voted for Kobe but with the fans vote A-rod won.

20090227025437AArLkk5	Sports;Fantasy Sports	How should I draft my fantasy baseball team?	My league is complicated..  For payout purposes we use both a rotisserie league and a head to head league.  The categories in the  leagues are (batting) runs, hr, rbi, steals, avg and then (pitching)  wins, k's, saves, era and whip.      Here's the thing...  it's fifty bucks to get into the league.  If I win a category then I win 15 bucks.  There will also be prize money for finishing in the top four in the head to head league and of course playoff money to be won.  There is also money for being the weekly winner and having the best all around team.      So I need help deciding the avenue to go.  I have the 5th pick in the draft and right now that might be a jose reyes.  Now pitching wise I thought about holding off on taking good starting pitching in between rounds 2 through 7 and build a solid offensive team on the field and then just throw out nothing but good closers....   I would wrap up three out of the five pitching categories (saves, era, and whip) and hopefully beat my opponent in the hitting categories.  I know at least one, maybe two guys like throwing out just closers so I'd have to at least get some of the top ones.             Am I totally missing something or could this work in not only giving me a competitive team but also give me a good chance at winning some money.  Any ideas would be great!!!!!  Thanks

20080803210525AAQN3Hy	Sports;Basketball	OKC and the new basketball team	I live in the heart of downtown OKC. I believe that we have deserved a pro franchise for awhile. So since I will obviously be biased, can anyone not from Seattle or OKC tell me what the big deal is with OKC having a NBA franchise.       Remeber when New Orleans had the Hornets before Katrina they were very poor at keeping attendance. We took the team in so they could still play ball and got their attendance up to #7. It would've been higher if they hadn't played 3 games in New Orleans that year.      Seattle had poor attendance and were offered the chance to keep the team if a new arena and better facilities were built. They did not comply.       So please give me a good reason how OKC or Clay Bennett did something  wrong. I will be open to any answer.

20090305074236AAantep	Sports;Wrestling	Why don't people understand that Cena can never be truly a heel?	Its just not going to work, Cena must stay a Face, the main reason now is because hes selling the most merchandise, yes the most merchandise out of adults and kids, so therefore if he turns heel they'll lose alot of profit, because the little kids don't even to buy Jeff Hardy or Rey Mysterio merchandise and they are meant to be popular with the kids.      Also Cenas personal life has got to much involved, the CD, the Movies, his family, its really going to be hard for him to try to play this heel role and everyone knows he's the coolest guy, fans wouldn't even boo him because hes a heel, and the fans you got booing him know would be cheering, so you'd have a 100% Cena crowd.      The main reason is he just shouldn't go heel, they don't have a top face to contend with him, When the Rock went heel Austin was a face, and when Austin went heel The Rock was a face, Cena has no one to match up with, please don't say triple h.

20090305071230AASfoZg	Sports;Football (American)	Is there any chance that TO goes back to Philly and reunites with Donovan McNabb?	The Eagles need a WR, and Donovan McNabb wants a WR and he's said this past year TO and him "could've been special". The Eagles are desperate for a WR and TO is the best available right now, and hes already been in Philly and brought them to the Super Bowl getting over that 3 year NFC Championship Game hump. I think TO would be happier in Philly than anywhere else he could possibly go, and McNabb would be happy to have TO back. It would be just like the 2004 NFC Championship squard but with a greater #2 WR(Jackson>Pinkston), and maybe a slightly better defense. The Eagles would than possibly make themselves the team to beat in the NFC East along with the New York Giants. What would you think about a TO signing back to Philly?

ACC,Big East,Big 12,Big Ten,SEC,Pac 10      My predictions      ACC   North Carolina-most talented team in the conference,and to me best team in the ACC by a landslide,UNC wins 3rd straight conference title   Big East   Pittsburgh-they always play well in the BET and have been consistent all year,somehow they always make it to the title game in the BET, Pitt repeats in 09   Big 12   Oklahoma-w/o Blake Griffin they struggled and probably wont win the regular season title,but they come through in the Conference tourney.   Big Ten   Michigan State-in a lackluster Big 10 they are the best team   Pac 10   Arizona State-James Harden has a big tournament and they get by Washington   SEC   South Carolina-something just tells me they will take it,I mean UGA did win this last year
