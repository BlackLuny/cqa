It shouldn't be blocked at school so yeah.    But I really wish people would stop asking how to get on MySpace at school.  MySpace is not a necessary part of your day, and school computers don't want people going on it for a reason.  Sorry for the rant but seriously >_>|`|2LbTrlQnaa	A formal representation (complaint) has been submitted to the Sunnyvale CA headquarters of Yahoo Inc. relating to the lack of moral responsibility displayed by Yahoo! Answers in indirectly encouraging the nations schoolchildren to access blocked websites whilst in school.  School computers are provided by taxpayers exclusively for school work.  Websites such as MySpace, Facebook, YouTube and similar sites are exclusively leisure activities which have no place within the school environment.  For a respected site such as Yahoo! Answers to provide the means for schoolchildren to exchange information about proxy websites (for the purpose of accessing blocked websites on school computers) is considered to be unacceptable and unpatriotic.  It is considered that Yahoo Inc. has a moral duty to require Yahoo! Answers to ban questions pertaining in any way to accessing blocked websites in the school environment.  As a sizeable minority of rebellious youngsters seem unwilling and/or incapable of obeying rules and respecting the authority of their school districts; Yahoo Inc. must itself take positive action to protect our schoolchildren from the error of their ways.|`|6Xreht4Qaa	There's new proxies every day on :    http://www.pr0xyblog.com    Be sure to tell your friends, and post it to your myspace page or blog, so others can enjoy ;-)    Happy Surfing !|`|X9F0nTygaa	big deal if you can't go on myspace at school.  it's not your computer.  myspace can have A LOT of viruses!  i'm 14 and i don't mind that i can't go on certain sites at school.  they're only not letting you   so they don't have to keep buying new computer.|`|FgsRcuDpaa	Let's initially establish: Proxies are not a requirement.  There is nothing that important that you have to bypass the internet filter that can't wait until school/work is dismissed. If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences; that you really don't want to. It's honestly not worth the repercussions involved.  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time.

The other option is to go into task manager and kill any processes that relate to whatever application was used to play the video (be it windvd, itunes, whatever) - once those are killed you should be able to nix the offending file.    Also, once you've either rebooted or ended processes, try doing a shift+delete to permanently delete the vid.|`|oOcQSylMaa	just restart the pc!!!|`|RWnsxyVOaa	First, restart your computer. This usually frees up locked files. If that still won't delete when it comes back up, the go to Start, Run. (Run should be at the very bottom of the Start Menu.)    Type in CMD and hit enter to get the Command Prompt.    What drive is the movie on? If it's on C, the type "C:" and hit enter. (For D, type "D:", etc)    Then type "cd \foldername\otherfolder\" or whatever the path is (if it's on your desktop, this will look like "cd \Documents and Settings\yourname\Desktop")    Then type "del filename" where "filename" is whatever the file is called.    This usually kills it no matter what.|`|ngExeZjuaa	Try rebooting into safe mode:  tap F8 key before logon window ...  See if you can delete it then.|`|3Coa0oZTaa	you should try Unlocker (see link below). It was made for this kind of stuff. After you install right click on the video and you should get an options that says unlocker. It may work right away, but if it doesn't it will say something like "locking handle not found" and it gives you the option to delete the file on the next rebooting of your computer.

The hosting company will then send you an email with the following details:  Hostname, username, password, which you enter under the 'site manager' option in Filezilla. Then whenever you want to upload files to the hosts server you just just open Filezilla and click on your account.

q9cchUCsaa	I would suggest anything object oriented. Seeing you have done basic C++, and learning Java, I would continue down that path. I have learned both and would say they have taught me a lot. Programming isn't necessarily the languages you learn but, the concepts behind the language.    Therefore, learn object oriented languages, like Java, and carry that over to whatever field you are interested in.|`|Irdj2KAFaa	C |`|nonDPoAVaa	Visual Basic is one of the easiest to learn|`|7bb0efb37d1d3c0228ce2e788f4e2555aa	Forget Macs... >:) you'll find Linux in anything technical like embedded systems, and Windows just everywhere else.

I bet Microsoft C , .NET, and SQL Server for high-level stuff, and C++ for low-level stuff.|`|UbmDSuoLaa	I think that you have already enough knowledge in programming if you know C++ and Java. Maybe you would like to get deeper on these.    Good luck!|`|sYqvnVPVaa	Since you've already some exposure to C++ & learning Java, I would recommend you continue on this. Although these aren't the best choices if you are thinking about CAD etc.   Whatever you learn, ensure that you get the basics right. That would help you in quickly adapting to any programming language. Some of the very basic concepts in Java are mentioned at: http://www.j2eeconcepts.com

If you wanted just to do a book without the animations, you can create it in Open Office and save it as a .pdf.    It's not clear from what you've said whether you have actually created those Flash animations yet or it's just kind of the plan.

Electronic media can be forwarded either automatically (like sports scores, weather alerts, stock market alerts, amber alerts etc.) or manually (friends see something of interest and they send it to you).

I recently purchased a macbook and i am in love with it. they cost more but are worth it.<br>  <br>  Some cool features of the macbook, is that when you start up the computer, it only takes seconds before it is ready to use, but when you boot up a PC, it can take several min before you can actually use it. Macs are also almost impossible to get viruses on... All in all go with the Mac, you wont regret it.<br>  <br>  The only reason i would choose a PC these days, is if i was playing video games on the computer... Other than that they are pointless in my opinion.|`|m80e3y1Eaa	Actually (speaking from first hand experience) Dell tech support and warranties are absolutely terrible.

SJM0rzHtaa	It depends on the TV.  The more recent your TV set is, the easier it is to hook up to your computer.<br>  <br>  HDTVs of recent vintage usually have HDMI or VGA ports.  These are computer-ready.  An HDTV's HDMI port can be connected to any PC that has a DVI port using a DVI-to-HDMI cable.  (Yes, DVI is compatible with HDMI).  And some HDTVs have VGA ports which you can connect to a computer's VGA port using a standard VGA monitor cable.<br>  <br>  If you have an old boob-tube TV that doesn't have HDMI or VGA, then it gets more difficult.  You will either need a video card that has the analog outputs the boob-tube needs, or you might need to buy a scan converter device that can convert VGA to one of those old analog signals.<br>  <br>  Me, I'm using my 52" LCD HDTV as my monitor.  It's connected to my computer using a DVI-to-HDMI cable, and it works perfectly.  <a href="http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f347/armchairaviator/computer/IMG_0880c.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f347/a...</a>|`|7aqEtfLRaa	TV tuners bring a TV signal to your pc, not the other way around. If your TV was designed to have a computer hooked up to it, it would either have a VGA or DVI port on it. If it doesn't, it's probably old, and wouldn't support a computer, or you would have to buy some extra cables or an adapter of some kind.

Vt0xnuWpaa	When you use the term "Gaming Laptop," people usually think of hyperfast dedicated gaming laptops (like Alienwares).<br>  <br>  However, the XPS M1530 is what you call a multimedia laptop - something that has power to meet your entertainment needs but not the extreme performance of a true gaming laptop. It is perfect for the casual gamer.<br>  <br>  It should easily run older games on highest settings. It can even handle the newest games DX 10 games like Crysis, but you need to lower the graphic settings. You still get a playable experience. It should very easily run Sims 2 and Sims 3 as well.<br>  <br>  The speakers and default sound on it is pretty average. It is not equipped with any special speakers nor dedicated sound card, but it does a good job with sound output and quality. You can always buy an ExpressCard sound card if you want better output.<br>  <br>  The biometric fingerprint scanner lets you scan all 10 fingers for each user account, and also allows you to use the fingerprint to register passwords and login to your user. Pretty fast and nifty. It has it's own control panel, so you can set it to be used for what you want.<br>  <br>  It's a very thin and pretty light laptop for its size. The keyboard is comfortable. The slot-load CD drive is a bit loud but it helps minimize the design and make everything look more slim. It has plenty of connectivity - 2.0MP webcam, built-in microphone, WiFi, optional bluetooth, 3 USB ports, etc (you can check the specs on the Dell website).<br>  <br>  The computer itself was shipped with all included software, a Leather CD case for your manuals and CDs, laptop sleeve, microfiber cloth, velcro wire ties, Dell Media Remote, and EP-630 noise canceling earphones; very accomodating.<br>  <br>  Dell support and extended warranties were a plus too.<br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  I own the XPS M1530 myself, and I find it to be a powerful and reliable laptop. Not to mention it's very well built and stylish. It's a real competitor in its price range. I've had mine since July 2008, and have zero problems and tons of fun.|`|QQhKa4fdaa	The dell XPS m1530 would generally be a pretty solid laptop, however the gaming experience will vary depending on what video card is configured to your specific laptop you buy. But other than that the XPS series would have everything you basically need.

vo42ZRPdaa	its actually right on speed for what you are paying for your reading the specs wrong 1000Mb is about 10 MB in speed<br>  so not sure what your expecting it to be but a gig a bit connection is not a GIGA-BYTE  as that would be OC192 speed (optical carrier 192) it will be slightly faster then your dsl connection /closer to fios speeds but not OC1 or T3 speeds|`|E5mFWOqqaa	Wow, your math is terrible. Gigabit means 1/8 of a gigabyte speed max (8 bits in a byte), or 125MB/s (roughly). If your hard drive has a limited speed transfer, which is likely does, you're likely only going to be able to transfer roughly 40MB/s max. So, 9MB/s is almost 10% of the theoretical max speed, but is more likely anywhere from 25% to 40% of your speed.<br>  <br>  You aren't always going to get your max speed- likely, you'll never reach it.<br>  <br>  The problem lies in your assumptions, not your hardware. Although if I were you, I would make sure that you are not trying to transfer files that are on a very badly fragmented hard drive, or one that's got a lot of junk files on it.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd run the Disk Cleanup utility on your computer, followed by the Degragmenter. I wouldn't say anything against running a spyware scan or virus scan. There might be something that's clogging your hard drive.

E5mFWOqqaa	Acer Aspire One, if you are getting the one with the Hard drive instead of SSD. The Hard drive model comes with XP (you can get one with Linux, but Linpus is crap, so I wouldn't do that) and has more hard drive space. Sure, that isn't the point of a netbook, but it's always nice.<br>  <br>  Pros<br>  -Aspire One has more HDD storage<br>  -Aspire One has more RAM <br>  -Aspire One is more commonly referred to as an amazing netbook- the Dell Mini was extremely overhyped and really was a huge letdown.<br>  <br>  Cons<br>  -Aspire Ones out now are being phased out, for the new models come out in March (March 15, I think). This does mean though a lower price.<br>  -Aspire One only has a 3-cell battery, not a 4-cell. The difference is very minor, as I think the cells in the Aspire One are larger than those in the Mini's battery. It's really equal.<br>  <br>  Go with the Aspire One. Dell's netbook is really a poor excuse, and even makes the earliest EeePC netbooks look decent, considering they came out a YEAR before the Dell Mini.<br>  <br>  I think the Lenovo S10 and the HP Mini 1000 are great netbooks as well. However, Acer put a great product together in the Aspire One- something that's very amazing considering their products below $1000 are almost all crap.|`|AA11736483	The Acer is a better machine.

zorYTX59aa	If your YouTube is getting bombarded with "JavaScript" and <br>  "Flash Player" messages, and people are telling you to get<br>  or install something, DON'T TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  You will get absolutely nowhere messing around with "Java", <br>  "Flash" or different web browsers -- and definitely avoid any<br>  software that sales-pimps (disguised as answerers here on <br>  Yahoo) are trying to "sucker" you into buying.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you, because your computer <br>  and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right? <br>  The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:<br>  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add, <br>  change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.<br>  <br>  I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"<br>  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really<br>  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer<br>  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a <br>  lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why <br>  in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54<br>  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good <br>  for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).<br>  <br>  Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the<br>  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of<br>  their own servers every single day without warning anybody, <br>  in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions, <br>  it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or <br>  "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.<br>  <br>  If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing <br>  you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages, <br>  it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely<br>  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being<br>  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay <br>  there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer <br>  much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of <br>  them. The solution to that is to first exit YouTube, and then <br>  clear your "cache" of all its "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" <br>  and "history". Then reboot.<br>  <br>  If you're not sure how to clear your "cache", or if you would<br>  like more tips on making YouTube run even better, (without <br>  having to buy or install anything), click my avatar and send<br>  send me a note, ideally with your YouTube or regular email <br>  address. I'll guide you step-by-step on how to clear "cache" <br>  (plus my tips) in plain English, with full explanations.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something<br>  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts <br>  my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on<br>  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever. <br>  (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are <br>  really disguised sales-people and peddlers. Their "answers" <br>  have nothing to do with your problem, and their wares may<br>  worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of selfish answer <br>  is that? [my paraphrase] "Although you cannot even watch <br>  or access videos, buy our downloader."<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").|`|owxFbRnNaa	javascript is usually turned on by default...so, it might be your flash player is outdated..<br>  <br>  you can try a different browser...<br>  <br>  these will help you...<br>  <br>  1.

UNLESS the screen you use is small like 1024 resolution by 768 u can play gta iv on medium settings then with the 9600.  I use 1440 by 900, the bigger the screen the better the graphic card u need to play the same game same performance.

They are way less expensive than compact notebooks.  You can get a really good one for about $300.  The only downside is the very small 9" screen and the fact that they do not have an optical drive.  However, their small size and small screen makes then very lightweight, and gives them very long battery life.

GlHHz1ehaa	Not sure if this is what you're looking for but when your audio is in the viewer, you can move your source and destination links to set your audio (L) on track A1 and (R) the other on track A5 or another track. You need to drag the source to whatever tracks you wish to have the audio on before you drag it onto the timeline. You can just drag them up or down. Not sure if this is what you wanted but I hope I helped a little. Good Luck.
XlyLakYAaa	The 9800GT is WAY better.  The 1GB of RAM on the 9600 is a complete gimmick.  The video card cannot handle 1GB of textures so you'll never fully use all that RAM.  Heck, you won't even fully use half of that RAM.  It's a waste.|`|d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	Mercury is correct, the 9800GT is much better.<br>  <br>  The number of stream processors, clock speeds and GPU on a video card are what tell you how fast a card is, not the RAM.<br>  <br>  If video cards were automobiles, the stream processors/clock are like the engine size (8-cylinder vs 4-cylinder) while the RAM is like the size of the gas tank.  A larger tank helps on really long trips, but isn't helpful in figuring out a car's performance.|`|fgbZugDlaa	I just want to also add that the 9800 is a far superior card.  Take into account the bandwidth of the cards.  While the 9600 has 1GB of RAM, it doesn't have the bandwidth to push data like the 9800 GT, so the 1GB of texture RAM is just really marketing fluff, since cheaper VRAM doesn't cost much.<br>  <br>  Go with the 9800 GT if you plan on playing games with the settings at anything reasonable.
AA11434745	You can't do this quite the way you want.<br>  <br>  Since you're using jQuery, you should use its built-in traversing functions. <br>  <br>  The easiest way to start is to assign all the affected anchors to the same class. For example:<br>  <a class="calendar" id="dialog1" href="" /><br>  <a class="calendar" id="dialog2" href="" /><br>  <a class="calendar" id="dialog3" href="" /><br>  <br>  You can then assign all the collected elements with common properties:<br>  $(".calendar").dialog( { autoOpen: false, width: 500 } );<br>  <br>  Note that there should not be a trailing comma after the second JSON property.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure where you are getting dialog_link_aug from, nor is it 100 percent clear from your code what it is you are trying to accomplish, so I can't help you too much more than this.

Shut down is a little slow, at around  a minute and a half. My guess is your new dell came with a lot of programs that run at start up. Get a free start up manager. There one in this tune up tool. I'll give you a link to download.com so you can check it out. Just remember if you do decide to use it, when you install it take the option it will give you to create a restore point.

I have my office PC set up so it only takes one click to open a desktop icon. I think double-clicking increases people's stress levels because you have to worry about clicking twice, and the clicks have to be precise or you run the risk of forcing a panicky second double-click. Plus, the extra time and effort required for the second click could be used elsewhere, like when you're making love or something. Imagine how much extra time and energy you would have today if you saved all the energy required for the second click. I firmly believe that the world would be a happier, calmer place if double-clicks were replaced by single clicks. And because of their extra energy and free time, people would be having more sex. I bet you're wondering how I can incorporate sex into a question like this. It's a gift. Sleep tight, sweetheart.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	I tried that with my heels. Nearly fell on my face.

This will pop up a dialog asking which computer you want to shut down. Click Add and type the network name of the computer you wish to shut down. You can also restart and logoff from here.<br>  <br>  Another way is to use a freeware program called RCLogon. Same idea as the windows program above just with a few extra features like login.

It is more likely that the IT people will monitor any strange activity.  EG.

222c3710b1c82cfb0a40a144369157a8aa	I'd say you defintiely should get a bigger power supply if the one you have is only 450 and the nvidia needs 500 minimum.  Go for 600 at least.|`|QYPrM3GPaa	You take the labeled watts (called Rated) and multiply it times 80% to get your working watts.  It is the working watts that counts.  The 80% is the average efficiency rate of a good power supply:<br>  <br>  450 x .8 = 360 Watts.  <br>  <br>  So you really only have a 360 watt PSU and this is barely sufficent to run your other hardware (that you described).  You need to ADD about 250 working watts to run an Nvidia GTX 280 card at high game play:<br>  <br>  Power needed = (380 + 250) = 600 Working Watts<br>  <br>  600/0.8 = 750 Rated Watts<br>  <br>  So you need to go up to a 750 Watt PSU and I would take a look at this PC Power and Cooling on Newegg for $139.  $104 after rebate.  It is SLI certified:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817703009" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a>|`|DF6asJPLaa	it should work,  but if you have to, power supplies are cheap, for a 550W Power supply, you can get it for around 30$ if you look in the right stores and places, also, NEVER BUY A USED POWER SUPPLY

XslxkaIGaa	Hi.  It is normally adviseable to have only one antivirus software on your computer at one time as they can conflict with another, which may be causing the slow down that you are currently experiencing.<br>  <br>  McAfee is a great free antivirus, although I prefer AVG.  You're really good with either one.<br>  <br>  To uninstall software, you can go to Control Panel, Add/Remove programs, and then click on the title, and then uninstall.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|VwxX8kDRaa	The others have good advice..<br>  <br>  However, if computer speed is an issue: McAfee hogs more system resources than AVG.  So, since you need to get rid of one, scraping McAfee will give you better performance & may be the better choice.|`|0bckNgILaa	Choose either McAfee or AVG, not both. They will conflict w/ each other. Malwarebytes is okay to keep w/ any antivirus program. For more effect, do full scans on safe mode.|`|9cc9d1b1db5e5452f3279720cee18e87aa	Never use 2 anti virus`s together. They will conflict with each other and give false positives. Get rid of one. Malwarebytes is agood program to keep.|`|8Yd3UO0Baa	As others have said, you shouldn't have two anti-virus programs running in real-time mode, so if you have AVG anti-virus (as opposed to the old AVG Anti-Spyware program) then you should uninstall it - link to special uninstaller below, if needed.<br>  <br>  If you mean AVG AntiSpyware then that is no longer supported so is no use to you.<br>  <br>  Neither McAfee nor AVG AV are the greatest. If you're happy paying for protection then, when McAfee subs are due, uninstall it and get Kaspersky or NOD32, far superior. If you want a freebie, Avast gives you more protection than AVG or AntiVir.<br>  <br>  Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware (free) doesn't run in real-time mode so won't stop malware getting on your pc but it should find and remove any of the bad stuff that might slip past your AV (which will also protect you against spyware).<br>  <br>  AVG uninstaller: <a href="http://www.avg.com/download-tools" rel="nofollow">http://www.avg.com/download-tools</a>|`|fizuyKBTaa	It seems that AVG takes up lots of computer resources<br>  so that the computer is slow. <br>  One of the reason that they find nothing may be that they<br>  r not so powerful.<br>  Aother is ur PC is healthy.

wkLTTr06aa	Hello,<br>  I can see two problems:<br>  <br>  The address is for your C Drive and the webpage is not found because that address is not on the server.<br>  <br>  There is supposed to be a "<html>" tag after your first line. Maybe it's there but not shown.<br>  <br>  Also the "</html>" tag is supposed to be last (not the "</body>" tag.<br>  <br>  I have had the same problem when trying to learn html. <br>  I would make the page and save it to a file on my desktop. <br>  Whenever I clicked on the "index.html" file the page would open up fine in IE or Firefox. But when I FTP'd it to my server I would get the same error. <br>  <br>  On my server the main (or first) page has to be named "index.html" and the file can not have any references to your C Drive. They all have to be located on your server at your address (the one they gave to you).<br>  When I make a webpage:<br>  I usually make a folder and save the "index.html" file inside along with any graphics and anything else called by "index.html" file.<br>  <br>  After everything is saved there and works OK in IE or Firefox then open your "index.html" file in notepad and check to be sure none of the image or text files do not point to your C Drive. <br>  Sometimes the file addresses are changed when you save.<br>  <br>  I recommend using Kompozer for making webpages and I use "tables" to position everything on the page.<br>  I<br>  If you want to use "frames" on your pages Komposer does not save the code for them. <br>  <br>  For frames I use Coffeecup which will make the frame pages and also allow you to preview what you've done. <br>  <br>  Either one allows editing in text mode but Composer usually will not save any frame code. <br>  <br>  Both Komposer and Coffeecup are free downloads and will save lots of time.<br>  <br>  I guess you know this but you will need an FTP client (like Core FTP Lite) to upload your files to your server. <br>  <br>  But before you upload check everything with notepad or coffeecup to be sure they did not get saved as being on your C Drive.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you some.

fXvOEZ8Yaa	Many keywords is not really the only thing that counts, it is better to have less keywords, but ones that are better for your ads. Make sure they are close to the public you are aiming at.<br>  You can also use negative keywords. These will make sure your keywords do not get combined into totally wrong keyphrases. For instance: Your ad is for a bed company, and one of your keywords is 'bed'. If people search for "in bed with Madonna", your ad will turn up. But, these people are not interested in beds, and thus will not click your ad. And if they do click, chances are small that they will actually buy from your website. Therefor, negative keywords.<br>  It is also very important to know your customers, who are you targeting at? Once you find that out, you can target your ads closer to them, for instance by using other keywords, or by advertising on specific websites, or by timing your ads, and for instance not advertising for a website on homework during the schoolhours, while your public has no access to the internet anyway.<br>  <a href="http://www.icantinternet.org/category/google" rel="nofollow">http://www.icantinternet.org/category/go...</a>

GlHHz1ehaa	I don't understand what your question is. Are you trying to get the swirly images where the person's body is (the black part)? <br>  <br>  If so, then you should be able to change it so the clip in the second track overwrites only the darker part (black) of the clip. I'm not sure how to do this, but i know it's possible. It might be located in the composite mode sub menu.

XmnVJxzaaa	Your CPU is fine. Even Crysis, the most demanding video game, only says you need to have a minimum, "... Intel Pentium 4 (2.8GHZ for XP ; 3.0GHZ for Vista."* A quad core Phenom crushes a 2.8 GHz Pentium 4. You have no worries there. Your RAM is fine too.<br>  But your graphics card is a little underpowered to play high end games. And by a little, I'm being polite. The 8500 GT was a decent card three years ago, but now... not so much. I'm sorry.<br>  There are, however, other decent, relatively inexpensive** cards that have replaced the 8500 GT. The nVidia 9500GT ($65 USD) is getting great reviews in 'bang for your buck' and can play most high end games at low to mid level settings (depending on how big your monitor is, you may even be able to play with some high settings). Here is a quick video review from TigerTV on YouTube***. The video review plays Crysis on this card, with a 19" monitor and low-ish settings at 27+ frames per second. Not stellar, but not bad for $65 either. <br>  The 9600 GT is an even better card, but hovers around $100 USD and may require a power supply upgrade. Something to consider of you have money to burn (who does?) and some ambition.<br>  I hope this helps. If you need more help, please add more details to this question, or feel free to email me through my Yahoo! Answers profile.<br>  Good luck!|`|QYPrM3GPaa	No, that is not good enough.

The 8500GT is about half the speed of the 9500GT, which is about half the speed of the 9600GT, which is the MINIMUM card for serious gamers.<br>  <br>  With a Radeon 4830 or Geforce 9800GT you can run most games on high, and Crysis on medium.<br>  <br>  With an Nvidia GTX 260 or ATI Radeon 4870, you'll be solid for the high-end titles.|`|9c87793532e3655df73e4c3ed99b032caa	It's a piece of crap.

Personally, the only time I want to use an electric screw device on a computer is when I install a motherboard in a case and when I screw a case together, and then I use a cheap low power unit that won't turn things too fast.  Now if I'm putting together or taking apart a server rack, I want a more powerful cordless device that will get the job done fast.<br>  <br>  Laptops are the only ones that use the tiny screws.  I like to be able to feel the screws coming out and know where those little suckers are going, so I do them by hand. I also put them in by hand so I can't strip anything - it's not my computer. It help me to magnetize the tips so the screws will stay on the tip as I remove them, then for the screws that are down deep that my screwdriver won't pull up for me, I have a telescoping magnetic pen that does the trick.  <br>  <br>  I have several sets of each and keep sets in the bag that I carry, separate from those that I have on my workbench.  You're not going to carry one of those expensive electric units out to the field with you -  it belongs on the workbench, but not on my workbench.<br>  <br>  Well, that's my 2 cents and this is my soapbox!  Thank you for listening.

zorYTX59aa	If YouTube is slow, stuck or weird, and people suggest you<br>  either change, install or get stuff....DON'T TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  Please don’t tinker with your "Java Scripts", "Flash Players"<br>  or different browsers -- and definitely stay away from any of<br>  the software that salespeople (disguised as answerers here<br>  on Yahoo) are trying to sucker you into buying.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you because I am pretty sure <br>  your computer and YouTube were working fine before, right?<br>  The first rule of thumb and ideal option should always try to<br>  be: DON'T disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, <br>  add, change or install anything. Matters will only get worse.<br>  <br>  Several times each day, YouTube shuts down a few of their <br>  servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck<br>  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer<br>  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time. <br>  That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios: <br>  bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish<br>  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the<br>  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few <br>  hours or by the next day.<br>  <br>  If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,<br>  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and RAM (sometimes known as "cache") are close to<br>  the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result <br>  being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to <br>  a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way; <br>  or C) never even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever<br>  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in <br>  a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them once and for all. <br>  Thus, exit out of YouTube, then clear your "cache" of all its<br>  "temporary internet files", "cookies" and "history". It is best<br>  if you shutdown and reboot afterwards. You'll be amazed at <br>  how "fresh" and "new" your YouTube will be.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you are using Google Web Accelerator or a utility<br>  similar to that: dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall <br>  it; do all that you can to get as far away from it as possible. <br>  Even though this contradicts all my advice, not only does it <br>  terribly conflict with YouTube, clicking on "Don't Accelerate <br>  This Website" won't help you whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos require both "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers may be shilling, because they <br>  are really disguised salespeople & peddlers. Their answers<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may<br>  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of idiotic<br>  answer is "Although you can't even watch or access videos <br>  properly, buy our downloader."

V4FXxzNnaa	I'm not going to do your homework for you, but I will help you.  For the truth table, just divide it up into separate parts.  For example you might make a column for y'z and another for wxy'.  Evaluate those terms separately and just combine the results together when you do the OR operation.<br>  <br>  For the minterms, what you need to do is get all four variables together for each term.  Let's start with the second term you have which is wxy'.  The missing variable is z.  How can you add z without changing the value of the equation?  Well, you just add it in a way that normally cancels out, like so.<br>  <br>  wxy' = (z + z')wxy'<br>  <br>  The z will cancel out normally, but for the minterms, you just distribute them across.<br>  <br>  The maxterms are really easy.  Whatever is NOT a minterm, is a maxterm.  So if your minterms are (1,3,4,6), then your maxterms will be (0,2,5) because those are the values that aren't present in the minterms.|`|vedx7D0Vaa	Hello friend,<br>  <br>            Before obtain the truth table, We should multiply the missed term in each term.<br>  <br>           =wxy`z+wx`y`z+w`xy`z+w`x`y`z+.........<br>  <br>  <br>  Like that do for other terms.<br>                    Draw a table for this formula. For sum of minterms, U just combine all the 1's in the table then get the result(f) after simplified the table.<br>  <br>  <br>        For sum of maxterms, You combine 0's then simplify the table and get the result ( f`' ) , Then take complement for that.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>                            Hope that it helps.

FyeYc2ozaa	first thing, every motherboard gives a beep sound. make sure you have a speak connected to the onboard connector of the motherboard. it will gives you beep codes. if not, the motherboard is defective. second, double check the power supply, sometimes it can be a faulty -5v connectors. just cuz you put it other computers and it works, doesn't mean it is still defective. third, try reading the specs on the motherboard and check the specs on the parts. you might have high specs on parts than motherboard, some motherboard won't detect that. fourth, check your cpu, sounds like you might have a faulty cpu, its rare that cpu is defective, but it can happen though. lastly, when installing a new motherboard, you will need to re-install all drivers/software including your os(operating system).|`|2WB76StOaa	I think you may have a partial or intermittant short in your monitor cable to computer connection.

Although HP indicates you have a 300 watt Psu, it is really only a 210 watt Psu. This is because in 2006, when this computer was made, the manufacturers of Psu's (Power Supply Unit's) didn't have to follow a standard.<br>  <br>  Computer manufacturers tend to put in a cheap power supply. Cheap components making up the power supply = cheap cost. Therefore, saving the pre-built computer manufacturer money. This savings (?) is given to the consumer who bought the computer. This, is the bull the computer manufacturer states. In reality, it just saves the pre-built computer manufacturer money, and costs the consumer in the long run. <br>  <br>  The power supply's made in 2006, only met 70 percent of the stated Maximum wattage rating. Now they must meet 80 percent, and most Psu's have a higher ratio. Some meet 90 percent of what is stated. SOME, EXCEED the Maximum wattage rating. (Certain after market units)<br>  <br>  Not only this, but your Psu is two and a half years old. <br>  (11-Aug-2006)  As time goes by, Electrolytic Capacitors inside a Psu break down. This is a normal thing. Designers who use Electrolytic Capacitors know this, and take this into account. They use capacitors that are rated at 50 percent better than needed. As the capacitors break down, they are still at the level needed.<br>  <br>  However, now you are going to add a graphics card, that exceeds what the designer of the computers system, has designed. More power than the original design is called for, and the Psu may not handle it, or at least not for very long.<br>  <br>  At first everything may be chilly. Then as time goes by, weird things will happen when you play a game. You'll think it's software related, or something to do with your Windows operating system. It won't be. It can be traced right back to that weak Psu.<br>  <br>  It is for this reason, that I recommend buying a better, more reliable Psu. <br>  <br>  I also recommend, buying 1 more GB of ram. 2GB's of ram, will keep you smiling for a long time.<br>  Games run very smooth with 2GB's of ram.<br>  <br>  Now I'm probably gonna' sound like a real bummer, but depending on what games you wish to play, that HD 3650 isn't Even going to cut it!<br>  <br>  Better to tell you straight up, then have you find all this out, and think, "I'll never listen, to those answerer's on Yahoo Answers again!"<br>  <br>  I recommend an ATI HD 4670, with 1GB of graphics ram, at least.<br>  <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4252544&CatId=28" rel="nofollow">http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/...</a><br>  After the $10 mail-in rebate, it's $85 bucks.<br>  <br>  I also recommend this Psu,<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817341001" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  Looks pricey, but after mail-in rebate it's $60 bucks.<br>  <br>  Why this OCZ StealthXStream 600 watt Psu?<br>  Because if you keep this Psu at around 118 degrees Fahrenheit, (47.9 degrees Celsius) it can put out 728.8 watts reliably! Your body temperature is 98.6 degress Fahrenheit.<br>  <br>  Be aware, that a computer only uses the power it needs, and NO more. If it only needs 100 watts to surf the 'net, it only uses 100 watts. If it only needs 400 watts to play a game, and it is capable of 728.8 watts, it ONLY uses 400 watts! <br>  <br>  This Psu has Four 12 volt rails, and 18 Amps (18A) for each rail. You can combine them to equal 72 Amps!<br>  It has,<br>  1.One ->20pin + 4pin ATX motherboard power cable.<br>  2.One ->4pin ATX power cable. (P4 MB) (12 volt)<br>  3.One ->8pin power cable (12 volt)<br>  4.Six -> Peripheral power cables (4pin Molex connector)<br>  5.Two -> 6pin PCI-Express power cables (12 volt) (2X PCI-E)<br>  6.Six -> Sata power cables.<br>  <br>  Your computer was made in August of 2006. PCI-Express 2.0 came out 15 January 2007.<br>  Therefore the PCI-Express technology used on your computer is the PCI-Express 1.1 technology.<br>  The HD graphics card you listed, and the one I listed, uses the PCI-E 2.0 technology.<br>  IT'S OKAY!<br>  <br>  PCI-E 2.0 is Backward Compatible with PCI-E 1.1!<br>  You won't get the full capability of a PCI-E 2.0 graphics card.<br>  You WON'T NOTICE either!<br>  You may get a frame rate drop of 2 to 4 frame rates. You won't even be aware of it!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI-Express" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI-Express</a><br>  PCI Express 2.0<br>  "PCIe 2.0 motherboard slots are backward compatible with PCIe v1.x. <br>  <br>  PCIe 2.0 cards have good backwards compatibility, new PCIe 2.0 graphics cards are compatible with PCIe 1.1 motherboards, meaning that they will run on them using the available bandwidth of PCI Express 1.1. <br>  <br>  Overall, graphic cards or motherboards designed for v2.0 will be able to work with the other being v1.1 or v1.0."|`|4mXEpFWaaa	A PCI Express x16 slot is a "sixteen lane" slot. This is the largest size available. If you have an AGP slot, you probably don't have this, as this slot is mostly used for graphics cards. The length of the slot is about 8.9 cm (total length).<br>  <br>  However, your power supply may not be sufficient. The minimum required is 300W. You have exactly that minimum. You can probably run this, but it's risky, since if there is any device that takes more energy than what is expected, your computer will not function properly.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your upgrade!|`|6u3PEYaiaa	OK what you have described is a processor instead of your motherboard.  When your computer boots up it possibly could give you the name of the board along with the numbers.  If you bought it new you should have a manual with it.  But please know that even though the card will work in a regular PCI  slot, you won't get the spped that you would normally get out of the PCI express.  You might want to think about checking and seeing if you have an AGP slot and getting an AGP card.  You will get much better preformance.  If you need help email me and I'll try to help you out.|`|ut6ZBZ5Haa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I feel this card is supporting your machine, bz HP Pavillon a1620n have 1 PCI Express x16 slot available..<br>  <br>  For more information plz visit the link which I given below.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00754198&dlc=en&lc=en&cc=us" rel="nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/docum...</a>

I thought I’d answer your Windows Movie Maker question, since I love that program.<br>  <br>  First, you need to go ahead and import any songs you want to use into WMM. You can simply click and drag them into the WMM window. Make sure you’re using files that are readable by Windows applications (as in, not DRM-protected iTunes files). <br>  <br>  Once you get them in your workspace, just select the song you want and drag it to the “audio” line in the timeline. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Ron<br>  Windows Outreach Team|`|NFPhggWkaa	you have to have the audio files on your computer already. so yes, you have to download it. then you click import audio and find the file, select it, and paste it into your timeline :]|`|FIFoGNIxaa	It has to be music from one of your saved files.

MvnfQ5B0aa	Following are the categories:..<br>  <br>  Bulletins<br>  <br>  Bulletins are posts that are posted on to a "bulletin board" for everyone on a MySpace user's friends list to see. Bulletins can be useful for contacting an entire friends list without resorting to messaging users individually. Some users choose to use Bulletins as a service for delivering chain messages about politics, religion, or anything else and sometimes these chain messages are considered threatening to the users, especially the ones that mention bad luck, death, or topics similar to that. They have also become the primary attack point for phishing. Bulletins are deleted after ten days.<br>  <br>  Groups<br>  <br>  MySpace has a Groups feature which allows a group of users to share a common page and message board. Groups can be created by anybody, and the moderator of the group can choose for anyone to join, or to approve or deny requests to join.<br>  <br>  MySpaceIM<br>  <br>      Main article: MySpaceIM<br>  <br>  In early 2006, MySpace introduced MySpaceIM, an instant messenger that uses one's MySpace account as a screen name. A MySpace user logs in to the client using the same e-mail associated with his or her MySpace account. Unlike other parts of MySpace, MySpaceIM is stand-alone software for Microsoft Windows. Users who use MySpaceIM get instant notification of new MySpace messages, friend requests, and comments.<br>  <br>  MySpaceTV<br>  <br>  In early 2007, MySpace introduced MySpaceTV, a service similar to the YouTube video sharing website. MySpaceTV is now in beta mode, and will probably be launched as a separate site in either 2008 or early 2009. MySpaceTV might be a standard channel that will be shown on television.<br>  <br>  Applications<br>  <br>  In 2008, MySpace introduced an API with which users could create applications for other users to post on their profiles. The applications are similar to the Facebook applications. In May 2008, MySpace had added some security options regarding interaction with photos and other media.<br>  <br>  MySpace Mobile<br>  <br>  There are a variety of environments in which users can access MySpace content on their mobile phone. American mobile phone provider Helio released a series of mobile phones in early 2006 that can utilize a service known as MySpace Mobile to access and edit one's profile and communicate with, and view the profiles of, other members. Additionally, UIEvolution and MySpace developed a mobile version of MySpace for a wider range of carriers, including AT&T, Vodafone and Rogers Wireless.<br>  <br>  MySpace News<br>  <br>  In the month of April 2007, MySpace launched a news service called MySpace News which displays news from RSS feeds that users submit. It also allows users to rank each news story by voting for it. The more votes a story gets, the higher the story moves up the page.<br>  <br>  MySpace Classifieds<br>  <br>  Full service classifieds listing offered beginning in August 2006. Has grown by 33 percent in one year since inception. MySpace Classifieds was launched right at the same time the site appeared on the internet.<br>  <br>  MySpace Karaoke<br>  <br>  Launched April 29, 2008, ksolo.myspace.com is a combination of MySpace and kSolo, which allows users to upload audio recordings of themselves singing onto their profile page. Users' friends are able to rate the performances. A video feature is not yet available, but Tom Anderson, MySpace co-founder and president, states that it is in the works.<br>  <br>  MySpace Polls<br>  <br>  MySpace Polls is a feature on MySpace that was brought back in 2008 to enable users to post polls on their profile and share them with other users.<br>  <br>  MySpace forums<br>  <br>  MySpace uses an implementation of community server for its forum system.<br>  <br>  hopefully i helped.<br>  <br>  Tiffany|`|avsgNsKEaa	MYSPACE CATEGORIES ARE CATEGAORIE THAT YOU PUT YOURE FRIENDS UNDER.IF U HAVE PROFILE 2.0 U CAN MAKE A CATEGORY WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE AND YOU CAN PUT IT SO THAT ONLY THAT CATEGORY CAN SEE THAT CERTAIN THING IT ALSO IS JUST A QUICK FINDER..TO FIND UR FRENDS QUICKLY.|`|9NcMh5m9aa	HelloMyspaceComments.com has better stuff

Alt+F4 is the shortcut to close single windows.  <br>  <br>  For closing multiple explorer (folder) windows, just hold Shift while pressing the close button and it should close all parent explorer windows as well.

d37db28e3e404f6d1cc80362c4cafe11aa	Why would you use a switch, or let alone a hub to hook to other WANs? Those connect to the router, the network has a hierarchy like this:<br>  <br>  Node (pc, printer, ip phones, etc.) ->switch/hub->Router/gateway. Throw in repeaters and bridges between networks.<br>  <br>  I'd go w/ either a gateway or a router (depends on the type of network, actually). Why? Because these devices "find" the most efficient way/route to transport data. The switch and the hub "just do it," the hub being the dumbest (read: less efficient but cheapest). Hubs and switches are used to connect other computers WITHIN the LAN because it's less extraneous and rather simple; that is, doesn't care about traffic or finding the most optimal route to deliver pockets of data.
zNS2zF2Daa	A LAN (Local Area Network) allows several computers to connect and share files, as well as a printer. This is usually done on a small business group of computers, or when gamers want to play games on their computers against their friends.<br>  A WAN (Wide Area Network) allows several computers to connect to the internet and share files between the computers that are connected to that network. This too allows computers on this network to share a printer. <br>  From what it sounds like you are trying to do, you probably need to look for a router with several ports, and a VPN (Virtual Private Network) capabilities. In most cases you can find an 8 port router with a VPN, but if you need more than that, Switches with VPN's can go up to 48 ports. A switch can then be connected to a router to allow internet access. Don't be concerned about a Gigabit switch or router,  you won't be able to maximize such speeds.|`|6TAp4PB5aa	okay... for modem connection, it usually uses LAN or Local Area Network, which is a wired connection. if you use:<br>  <br>  router : you can connection through wired and wireless ( LAN and WAN).<br>  <br>  switch : LAN only<br>  <br>  hub : LAN only.<br>  <br>  Routers can be used for LAN and WAN at the same time. WAN is Wireless Area Network.

Vt0xnuWpaa	Windows Vista tends to collect a lot of temporary data, especially when you first begin to install programs. To clear some of that up:<br>  <br>  1. Go to "Computer"<br>  <br>  2. Right Click "Properties" on your main drive<br>  <br>  3. Go to "Disk Cleanup" for all users<br>  <br>  4. Choose what types of files you want to clear. NOTE: DO NOT DELETE THE HIBERNATION FILE CLEANER - YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO USE HIBERATE MODE WITHOUT THIS<br>  <br>  5. Press ok and wait for it to delete those files.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  However, the major culprits are System Restore Points and Shadow Copies. Vista likes to back up files often so that you will have many different points to which you can restore your system in case anything happens.<br>  <br>  You will want to go back to the same clean-up menu as described above, but go to the "More options" tab and periodically "Clean Up" System Restore Points and Shadow Copies. I do this every month or so and get back around 20-30GB of space.<br>  <br>  You can also allocate how much space you want to allow Vista to use for these Restore Points and Shadow Copies|`|YESUhp8gaa	1: your manufacturer puts in a built-in hidden recovery partition that takes space<br>  <br>  2: The manufacturer and microsoft put programs automatically in there<br>  <br>  3: The operating system is self takes up a quite bit of space.<br>  <br>  4: hard drive space is often estimated and is never really equal to 137 gbs.|`|ybJgTZIDaa	Is there a "hidden" recovery partition?

But to help slow down the virus: The first thing that I'd recommend is to pull up task manager and then select the processes tab. Now find a process that sounds suspicious. If you're not quite sure where to start click the CPU button at the top and scroll all the way down to the bottom. If your computer is running really slow it will most likely be about 90% to 99%, then just end the task. If you don't see any applications that have a high CPU usage then next try Memory. Click the "Memory" button at the top and then scroll all the way down to find the application that is taking up the most Memory and then end it. That should buy you some time. And before you end the task, look at the name of application and Google it. This way you might find some DIY ways of removing the virus. I really hope that helps.

You're going to need a good monitor, and it has none.  You're going to need a good processor, and that old pnetium 4 is terrible for gaming and multimedia, and you absolutely must have a good graphics card for gaming or any sort of video rendering and it has none.  Computers designed for gaming and video rendering are the most powerful and most expensive.  If you want decent gaming computer, you have to spend at least $100 on a graphics card (like a 9600GT) for it to handle even modest gaming.<br>  <br>  Don't get a DELL.  Get with a friend who knows a lot about computers and see if they'll help you build one yourself and customize it to your needs.  Get all the parts off NewEgg.com and save a ton of money that way.  If you can't find the help to build your own computer, spend the extra money and go with an Alienware.

It comes with a bracket for a shorter case, such as a Dell Dimension or Gateway box that can't take full height cards.

Once you have the router set up, you search for your essid on your router then you type in your web key, also located on your router. Then you will have your network set up.

Most routers allow for you to hook the router up to the modem then run up to four ethernet lines to computers so you do not have to be wireless. But even with a desktop hooked up to the router via ethernet line, you can still use the router for the wireless at the same time. My advice is to buy a router and an adapter for the laptop, hook it all up near the desktop and simply use an ethernet line to the desktop and use the wireless for the laptop. Here are some links for good inexpensive very easy to set up and really good brand router and some adapters for the laptop. The adapters will be usb adapters for easier use for you. Linksys is the brand i use and I set up wireless networks for hotels and motels as part of my business. Good luck to you. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=3910279" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  This one is really good, has decent range, four ports for ethernet connection and is less than 50 bucks, has one touch set up as well, but I recomend using the desktop to do the setup for it and use a network key on it to stop others from using your wireless network.<br>  <br>  Now for some good adapters:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=2470735" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  This one is good and less than 40 bucks<br>  <br>  Both of these are good, and if you decide to go wireless with the desktop as well, the adapter will work on that too, but you would have to buy 2 of them for that so if you decide to only use wireless with the laptop you can do it for about 100 buck more or less, and for both you can do it for 150 buck more or less. Not too bad, maybe less than you figured on spending. Linksys is a great brand as well. Good support if you need it and really good support for setting them up as well. Also, if the store does not have these in the store use the site to store shipping on the website and there will be little or no shipping costs and it will get to you faster as well.

Router, switch, your "other PC"?<br>   <br>  If your modem is connected to PC and your PC is connected to your laptop, that means you PC has two network cards. Since your laptop most likely has two network cards ( 1 wireless, 1 wired) you can connect your iphone to your laptop using wireless and your laptop can connect to PC with wire.<br>   <br>  But this is bad setup. Since you have several devices to access internet, it would be much better to invest some money on router. And everyone connects to router. And router "routes" all traffic to modem.

HLd90MNraa	i wouldn't buy from a store or anything like that,<br>  you won't get that great of a computer.<br>  they make the prices higher than it needs to be for they make profits.<br>  i mean, after charging you for the shipping and all that junk too.<br>  high priced, lower quality. you'd probably pay 3,000 for a computer that took them 2,000 dollars to make.<br>  and most computers you buy will just be 'general' computers,<br>  which are like. decent all around, and not that great specifically for whatever you need it for.<br>  <br>  if you want the best computer you can get for your money, then i would suggest going to nanafriend.<br>  they're not a big company but they're amazing.<br>  what they do is talk to you, and build a computer personally for you, based on being best for what you want to use it for. best quality you can get for your money, they really know their stuff.<br>  they go by whatever budget you have, and provide a lifetime of support and all that. they're really cheap, you basically only pay for the parts to build your computer. and you can request specifics if you want,<br>  and they go through it all with you and even let you choose your case and all that. they're really cooperative.<br>  i just bought a computer from them a while ago and am extremely satisfied.<br>  it's definitely the best deal you can ever get for your money, the only other thing that would be any cheaper is to build it yourself, but it would still cost around the same price. they show you everything that's going into buying the parts and all that, all brand new from the company too. check them out, i'm sure you will be very happy with them.<br>  <br>  www.myspace.com/nanafriendpcs<br>  <br>  hope i helped,<br>  good luck!|`|uQ5U5esPaa	Get the macbook Pro.

129a9f833253ac73d33471642e71c611aa	There is a certain safety center in our body that keeps us alarmed of the various dangers that come into our way of life. We come to know of these safety limits during our growing years as a child. <br>  <br>  While as a child we were often restricted by our parents or feared to by them, if faced with an unusual situation. It is from then that we have become apprehensive about meeting anything new and foreign.<br>  This type of fear accompanied with a number of familiar symptoms like, rapid heart rate, dry mouth, constant perspiration, lack of clear thought and speech, trembling in fear, fear of dying, anxiety attacks, breathing trouble, and a plethora of associated difficulties in survival.<br>  <br>  However, you must be remembered that you are neither the first nor the last one to suffer from the plight of the peculiar fear of the unknown.<br>  <br>  Self Help NLP techniques are, so far, the best way to help yourself out of this peculiar plight. The particular process helps in resurrecting your lost confidence and build up a healthy mindset that frees you from the shackles of your fear. <br>  <br>  It removes the negative feelings and ideas about the fear of the unknown or unfamiliar and restores the mental and physical peace.<br>  <br>  Just remember...

ce66b42811382ce693d27924c6e2e235aa	When you listen to audio files in iTunes, they are often saved as .mp3 files, which will register on any iPod. Conversely, video files are .m4a *as far as i know*. Due do this, I don't think you'll be able to load that on your iPod, because it's a video file. However, there are programs out there where you can simply extract the audio. If you want to have the video on your computer and still load the song on your iPod, try this software: <a href="http://www.aoamedia.com/audioextractor.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aoamedia.com/audioextractor.h...</a><br>  <br>  This software is Freeware, so you won't have to pay for it. In order to extract the file, simply locate the file in your hard drive (you can right click on the file in iTunes, then click *show in windows explorer* and it'll show you where the file is. Then, open the program I linked earlier and it will allow you to make a .mp3 file of the video (without the video, of course) which will play on your iPod. <br>  <br>  I hope this will answer your question.

Either way, you should get it checked out by a qualified technician.<br>  <br>  If you want to know why the battery hasn't gone down, it's because the laptop is running from the charger. As long as a laptop is connected to a charger, it doesn't need a battery. It will happily run without one.

Same with Ram.<br>  <br>  More info.<br>  <br>  Also;  Chances are that a lot of other components burned up with the board.  Processor, ram, hard drive, power supply.

E5mFWOqqaa	1. There are 1024 bytes in a kilobyte (KB). There are 1024KB in 1MB, and 1024MB in 1GB. So, 1024^2, but for the sake of keeping this math simple, about 1 million. You should be fine if you are just going to type. Most laptops come with 250GB hard drives now- 250 million KB. The cheaper ones (which will probably work for you, come with a hard drive of about 160GB- 160 million KB. If you are only typing, you will never fill that up- the laptop will die before then. <br>  <br>  Also, if you are talking about memory (RAM) and not the hard drive size, 1GB can be enough, depending on what you are doing. Likely, it'll be enough, but you might want to look into laptops that have 2GB or more RAM. It'll probably be better for you.<br>  <br>  2. Certainly. If you couldn't type on a notebook, their portability would be rather useless. I've found that I actually type faster on my notebook keyboard than I do on my desktop's- by a decent margin too.<br>  <br>  3. Yes, Acer laptops are junk- especially the cheap ones. It would be okay for a word processor, but if you have any issue, tech support isn't the best, and the parts will die quickly.<br>  <br>  4. No, not all computers come with Microsoft Word installed on them. Well, actually, all Windows laptops today do- it's just a 60 day trial, and once that's up, you have to buy the program (which can be very expensive, the basic version is over $100). Purchasing it and installing it yourself isn't that big of an issue though, as it's really very easy to do.<br>  <br>  If I have confused you at all, and you need clarification, or want more information, do feel free to message me and I'll be more than happy to help you.

XmnVJxzaaa	There is a website:<br>  <a href="http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/referrer/srtest" rel="nofollow">http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/ref...</a><br>  that test whether or not a computer is able to adequately run a video game. There is a drop down list that you choose your game from and then hit the, "Can you run it" button. The site has been talked about by a few of the PC magazines I regularly read with no one saying the site is a bad thing. Hopefully, they will have the game you are looking to play.<br>  The ATI Radeon 7000 graphics card is close to 9 years old. The Radeon Xpress 200 is newer at only 5-ish years old. That should mean you are able to play the game. I say 'should' because the Xpress 200 is a integrated graphics solution. Most games are sensitive to a graphics card having the latest drivers for the game to play smoothly. <br>  Most computer manufacturers (Dell, HP, Acer, etc...) are notoriously slow in releasing new drivers for their system. As long as customers don't report functionality issues (something NOT working), they are happy with leaving things as they are. It doesn't matter to them that the latest games aren't supported. Your system works as it should.<br>  You could try visiting ATI's website directly and see if they offer driver support or updates for your graphics card. I do see an Xpress 200 integrated graphics driver listed, at least for XP Media Center Edition (I didn't check the other operating system). The driver from ATI directly should work.<br>  I hope this helps. If you need more help, please add more details to this question, or feel free to email me through my Yahoo!

You need to install iTunes on a computer for that computer to run iTunes. This requires running the installer.    Update: You can't copy the program. It has to be installed. You can copy the installer and run it on the other computer. Note that if you copy songs, videos, and such, they won't play on the other computer unless they are licensed on it.|`|GcZRN4kkaa	What do you want to copy, the programme or the music?

In that case they could just leave the item next to your door.<br>  You would call amazon and figure this out ahead of time. Also UPS and FedEx have an option where you call them and tell that they could receive an item for you and hold it for you in their office. You will come in to their office at your convenience.

It's probably the Firewall you have created around your existing connection which is causing this - I'm guessing!

QYPrM3GPaa	There is a GPU (graphics processing unit) which is a dedicated CPU (central processing unit) on the graphics card.  The Clock Speed is the internal clock of the GPU, which is a square signal on an oscilloscope. The signal is often generated by a specific quartz clock chip which provides the frequency of the GPU, located on the graphics card or in the GPU.  Each clock is an execution cycle which allows for the execution of an instruction in the GPU.  There are typically four parts of the cycle, going up, level (a value of 1) and going down, the level is the wait time between up and down cycles where an execution takes place of a single instruction.  the low signal is between square signals and is equivalent to a zero. So it goes something like:<br>  <br>  Begin ->execute instruction(up) -> digital value of 1 wait -> execute instruction(down)->digital value of zero.  The memory clock is the same thing only it is located in the memory on the video card and has a similar quartz clock  providing the exact frequency of the memory
XslxkaIGaa	Hi.  If your computer has RESTORE activated on it, then you can simply go back to the earliest restore point and restore your computer to that date and time.

nRS4LkNVaa	Listen to your mother and save your computer .  They ain't cheap.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	First, every time you do this you are leaving corrupted temporary files all over it as it can not clean up before it stops. Second, it can not park the drive head, which will then be over the disk when you switch off, and the power surge can actually do damage to the drive. In fact it probably always does some damage each time. Eventually this will stop the machine and may require a total re-install, and often a new drive. You will lose everything if this happens. I see no sensible reason for ever doing this.|`|QYPrM3GPaa	Yes it is bad.  Eventually you will corrupt a system file, like NTDLR or the boot.ini boot loader and then you will not be able to boot the computer.<br>  <br>  XP and VISTA save the last two or three good bootups (including shut downs) and this is known as your "Last Known Good Configuration).  But every time you cold shut the computer like that you negate XP or Vista from saving a good shut down routine and then your saved last known good startups are replaced by bad shutdowns.  This is when you start loosing things, and eventually, you mess up a system file and you are done.  The only way to recover from that is hopefully, to have a restore point or your system restore CD (if you have one)..and barring those things...you end up loosing everything on the hard drive and have to reformat and reinstall the operating system.<br>  <br>  So stop being LAZY and do like your mother says, she knows what she is talking about!|`|8O3ZdHuTaa	It is very bad, you are killing the power to the computer when the hardware is not ready for it and when you may still have unsaved data.  Your computer doesn't save data right away and if you just pull the plug/hit the switch, you have a high chance of corrupting an important file and if not, you will burn out your hard drive.|`|XslxkaIGaa	It can create issues with your hard drive.  When doing a proper shutdown, the computer prepares the hard drive for this so that it is not corrupted.

If you do this while the system is reading/writing a file, corruption can occur.  Generally there won't be issues with this, but there CAN BE and it is never advised you turn a PC off without doing a shut down if at all possible.|`|DF6asJPLaa	as long as you are not saving stuff to your hard drive, you should be fine, but it is not recommended|`|4qyMF86iaa	it wont hurt the first time, but it is bad over time. why do you do that any ways?

c59aa0746b771ce4755726e1da6772d1aa	Avira is very good and easy to use; Vista does have a firewall turned on by default but it doesn't block outbound access so everything is allowed access. Replace it with PC Tools Firewall Plus (free version) which in my mind is easier to use than Comodo  http://www.pctools.com/firewall/  install it in normal mode rather than expert mode; by default it allows programs with digital signatures to work unimpeded so you should see a lot less intervention; as it requires a reboot and Avira doesn't, install avira first then PC Tools Firewall  You may be prompted to install Threatfire which is another security tool that works well alongside traditional firewalls and antivirus, monitoring your system for malicious behaviour; my advice would be to install it separately after you have seen how your system runs with just the firewall and antivirus.  http://www.threatfire.com/    CCleaner is excellent; use it regularly. You can safely run scans with Malwarebytes Antimalware to check for spyware too  http://www.filehippo.com/download_malwar...  As added browser security, you can install Spywareblaster - not a scanner - you just update it and enable all protection and it works in the background; light on resources and doesn't conflict with the programmes I have already mentioned - free  http://www.filehippo.com/download_spywar...|`|SIaTnM5Qaa	Norton Internet Security is a waste of money...its not even that good....I would recommend that you get BitDefender because it is the best antivirus out there...beating both kaspersky and nod32...but their also good....if you want a free firewall i would suggest getting Comodo Firewall because its really good.....this is coming from a computer tech guy.....|`|ngExeZjuaa	ZoneAlarm   blocks incoming & outgoing  ..  FREE|`|tOCESHLYaa	First the new Norton Internet Security2009 is a very good program. It scores high in all tests. Even the reviews who in the past hated Norton are really impressed with it. But if you don't want to pay for security or Norton does not run good on your computer there are some good free options. Avira is a good program that is free. You may want to add an anti-spyware program with Avira. It does not have anti-spyware in the free version. But it does seem to catch most spyware. But will not get ad-ware. Avast is free also. It is a good program. That has anti-spyware and web protection. Yes windows does have a firewall. You may want to add a two-way firewall like Comodo. Just make sure when installing you don't install the anti-virus program. Also note that Comodo takes some time to learn how to set it up. Ccleaner is not a security program. It is more of a file cleaner. I think you should get Malwarebytes Anti-Malware free version or SuperAntiSpyware free. Use one of these as an on demand scanner. In case something is missed by you av. Also you should use firefox. That will really cut down on your chances of getting hit with spyware. If you really want to be free from Malware you could try Sandboxie. While surfing the internet or opening email in the Sandbox nothing can infect you. Just set it to delete sandbox when closed.

rNA6x4r2aa	public String max(String x, String y)<br>  {<br>  return ((x.compareTo(y) >= 0) ? x : y);<br>  }<br>  <br>  This simplifies the code, reducing how much you need to write, but also doesn't need another String object to return.<br>  <br>  The thing in your code though, is that you are returning an int, but the method is set to return a string. Are the strings just numbers? In which case, you'll need to parse each string to pull the number, compare then, and then return the string. If you are trying to return a string that is.<br>  <br>  public String max(String x, String y)<br>  {<br>  try {<br>  int xi = Integer.parseInt(x);<br>  int yi = integer.parseInt(y);<br>  } catch(Exception e);<br>  return ((xi >= yi) ? x : y);<br>  }|`|0wUwKbHsaa	First, you need to define better what "larger" means.  Do you mean longer?  You also have a lot of problems with this code.<br>  <br>  Additionally the compareTo method of the String object may not be what you are looking for. It lexicographically compares two strings and returns a negative if the lexicographic value is less, 0 if they are same, and positive if the value is larger.<br>  <br>  Your method also does not take into account if the strings are equal.  <br>  <br>  Look at your code:<br>  What is the line maxString; doing?<br>  You have defined a method called max and then are using max as a String variable AND trying to make it equal to another string using the equals operator?  <br>  What is return in max doing?  Again you have a method called max and you are trying to cast it to int?<br>  <br>  Obviously you are learning but you need to take a step back and try to do this step by step.|`|aKwJKR7faa	it should be something like<br>  <br>  public String max(String x, String y)<br>  {<br>  if(x.compareTo(y) >= 0)<br>  return x;<br>  // (given if x == y, return x<br>  <br>  else <br>  return y;<br>  <br>  }

vL2Ec50Yaa	No one seems to want to answer your question so I'll give it a try.<br>  <br>  If you inserted a new blank hard drive, Did you put an O/S CD in the cd drive and make sure that your Bios is set to boot to the cd first?<br>  You need to install the operating system on a new hard drive.<br>  <br>  By any chance, did you remove the cover that houses the memory chips?<br>  If so, (even if not) take the ram out and put it back in (reseat the ram).<br>  No video can sometimes be caused by not the ram not being seated properly.<br>  <br>  Another item to check (and the last place you want to check because you'll have to remove the keyboard) is the connector from the screen to the motherboard.  Sometimes they come loose and have to be reseated.  If you are going to attempt this you need to have the service/maintenance guide for your model, which yo0u may be able to download from the manufacturers' website.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps...
3ZTzrfj2aa	you need a program to convert the files to wav format.|`|18VdvhtHaa	This depends on how you have burnt the songs onto the CD.  Most songs on your computer will no doubt be in a format called MP3.  Most CD Players can not play this type of file.<br>  <br>  Using iTunes to burn CD's for your car is actually quite easy. <br>  <br>  1.  Create a new Playlist (File --> New Playlist)<br>  2.  Drag and drop about 15 - 20 songs onto your new playlist (It depends on the length and quality of the songs)<br>  3.  Once you are done you can decide to re-order them how you wish them to be on your CD.<br>  4.  In the bottom right hand corner of iTunes (Assuming your new playlist is on the screen) click the "Burn Disc" buttom<br>  5.  A pop up box appears.  Select "Audio CD" as the type of CD.<br>  6.  Click Burn.<br>  7.  Once it finishes it will eject the CD that you can now play in your car and in most CD players (NB. Some older CD players can't read burnt CD's at all)<br>  <br>  8.  If you wish you can also make a cover for your CD by clickin File --> Print, select "CD jewel case insert" and click print.

You can usually access your router by typing the address 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.2.1 in your internet explorer if your lucky. If it comes up asking for authentication, try the default "admin" as both the username and password. If all works you should be able to access the router. If your trying to play Halo, you might need to look into Port Forwarding.<br>  <br>  If the firewall is located on the PC, try creating a shortcut with the path "control" this will allow you to access the control panel when you double click it and then get to "Windows Firewall", make sure Halo.exe is allowed.

You can find some here - <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/collection/collid,1295-order,1-c,downloads/files.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/collect...</a><br>  <br>  The way it works on a computer is that when a file is deleted, physically the space on the hard drive is marked as usable or free.  So, if the space is needed to write something, then it can use the space where your file used to be.  These deletion recovery programs find spaces that have been marked as free but actually have information and then try to build something useful out of it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|PlHjhwtAaa	yes but you will need to recover the lost files by doing a system restore about a week ago or however long it was that you had them|`|SnU8rQBkaa	no|`|nlbwcfi0aa	nope once you empty the trash bin theyr gone for ever|`|uvBnCKgxaa	yes go into your history on your computer go to settings and hit retrievee it and it should come back but it also depends on what kind of computer model you have.|`|SGoqMXfKaa	you can get them back but i dont know how my cousin knows how email me back at preciouslilmamas805@yahoo.com and ill give you hi number|`|bs1QqRN8aa	Have you tried a system restore?|`|yo6OTEXnaa	go to the dumpster  and search for em!<br>  <br>  <br>  dont be lazy  get up!

Your computer came with a 'Tyler' core AMD Turion 64 X2.<br>  The fastest TL-series I was able to find is the Turion 64 X2 TL-68 at 2.4 GHz. It is also Tyler core, so should swap right in. I was only able to find one website selling that CPU at $350 USD. I'm sure with some looking you may be able to have better luck.<br>  I hope this helped.

Answers in indirectly encouraging the nations schoolchildren to access blocked websites whilst in school.  School computers are provided by taxpayers exclusively for school work.  Websites such as MySpace, Facebook, YouTube and similar sites are exclusively leisure activities which have no place within the school environment.  For a respected site such as Yahoo! Answers to provide the means for schoolchildren to exchange information about proxy websites (for the purpose of accessing blocked websites on school computers) is considered to be unacceptable and unpatriotic.  It is considered that Yahoo Inc. has a moral duty to require Yahoo! Answers to ban questions pertaining in any way to accessing blocked websites in the school environment.  As a sizeable minority of rebellious youngsters seem unwilling and/or incapable of obeying rules and respecting the authority of their school districts; Yahoo Inc. must itself take positive action to protect our schoolchildren from the error of their ways.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	It depends on the type of 'filtering'.

There is nothing that important that you have to bypass the internet filter that can't wait until school/work is dismissed. If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences; that you really don't want to. It's honestly not worth the repercussions involved.  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time.  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible.

5fkqsnBJaa	My recommendations (plus one) if you are looking for some free (and legal) freebies:    1. For the typical home user of XP or Vista, Windows Firewall is adequate, even more so if one is using a router, which is a very good firewall in itself. Make sure your Windows Firewall is turned "on".    2. For your Anti-Virus......(Always use only 1 A-V...You must NEVER use more than one anti-virus, Even an expired anti-virus can cause a major conflict...did I mention that you MUST uninstall any and all, old anti-virus products?)    I would suggest Avast, the newest version 4.8. Avast now includes anti-virus, some anti-spyware capability and anti-rootkit components. And all for the low low price of free. You can get it here:  http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    3.  For your Anti-Adware and Anti-Spyware needs...  SUPERAntiSpyware:  http://www.superantispyware.com/    They have a free version.    4. Use Secunia PSI to insure that all your software is kept always updated and patched against vulnerabilities that are often exploited to compromise computers. Very important.     http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scannin...    Its free as is everything else here. Saving cash these days is important!|`|SIaTnM5Qaa	Trust me....Just get the BitDefender Internet Security...it is the best overall out there right now....its  1...it beats both kaspersky and nod32....eventhough their good also....dont listen to other people on here because most dont know what their talking about....im a computer tech guy....so yea.......but if your looking for something free i would get AVG, Avast, Comodo, Spybot Search & Destroy, Malwarebytes...use that combination...it wont interrupt one another....|`|lwnyWVsoaa	For what?    In any case, 2.|`|AA11324217	Are you talking about which I think is most important our of the three to have? or are you asking about what are my picks of the best programs in each categorie?  I think it's probably important to have all three, because just one of them wont protect you from everything.  My picks in the various categories are as follows:  1. Firewall: I would probably have to say Comodo Firewall.  2. Anti-Virus: This is expensive, but it's proven to be a great line of defense for me, Symantec Anti-Virus. If you want something free though, I would go with AVG Anti-Virus.  3. Anti-Spyware. I would have Spyware Blaster on my computer, and get a program like Ad-Aware and CCleaner. Spyware Blaster protects from Spyware, and Ad-Aware and CCleaner keep your computer clean.

N9nJWYa5aa	Laser "ink" works like wax.  On normal paper it's placed using electrostatic charge, the same sort of thing as makes your hair stand on end during a thunderstorm or if you rub your socks on a carpet with a high nylon content.  Once the "ink" is in place it's fixed by heating it to make it melt into the paper.  The problem is your metallic paper isn't porous, so the "ink" can't melt into it, instead melting and sitting on the surface, and as you've witnessed it chips off.|`|eYn7maNTaa	It's quite possible that the printer and paper are not compatible. Have you tried it with ink-jet with same results? With specialty paper you may need to allow the ink to dry out completely and not stacked on top of one another. Good luck.|`|a00a78740b4cb65d519bfb84e169590eaa	Because you cannot print on metallic paper with a laser printer.    The way laser printers work simply does not mesh well with a metallic or gloss paper. It uses a high temperature fusing strip to melt the toner to the paper.    If the paper is glossy or metallic, the melted toner will just flake right off.    You would have to use an inkjet printer and let it dry for a long time, then it might work.
vL2Ec50Yaa	If you have an option that suggests that it will pause on error messages (sorry, I don't remember the correct wording) choose that.  This way the blue screen won't disappear.  Write down the error message that it gives you.  It should say STOP:.........  the first set of numbers are the most important and I would use that in a search on Google to locate the reason as to why you are getting that message.  Also, sometimes on that same page (up close to the top of the page) will be another error message... a phrase with a '_' between each word.  I would search on that also.  This will help identify the problem and provide a solution.    Hope this helps.    By the way, don't jump right into running the recovery disk without backing up your precious documents first.    If you have no luck in fixing the problem, use the O/S cd and do a repair.  Once you make it to the Dos prompt, tyope if the following: chkdsk /r    and let it run.

SJM0rzHtaa	Fortron Source has always been one of the most reliable brands of PSUs on the market for the past 20 years.  They got a 400-watter with a PCIe 6-pin power lead for $40  at Newegg:  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817104953" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  Fits your criteria nicely.

If you have a good graphics card, you certainly don't want to just settle for a bad quality PSU that lacks reliability and performance.|`|h0hSIgC1aa	The 9600gt is a relatively low-power card, let's see how a typical system fares in my favorite PSU calc  <a href="http://www.extreme.outervision.com/psucalculatorlite.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.extreme.outervision.com/psuca...</a>  ...<br>  <br>  Q6600 / 2 x ddr2 / 1 x sata / 1 x dvdrw / 4 x fan / 1 x 9600gt = 243W !! that is it!<br>  <br>  So let's see what is available on the 'egg - FSP, very good units someone had mentioned - but with shipping it may put you over budget.   The Basiq, not too bad, and FSP is the OEM for Antec's Basiq line so they are not so bad at all.  MicroCenter does have it for $40 as well and they do have reasonable shipping... but let's see what the 'egg has to offer w/ the free shipping links (gotta love the 'egg)...  hmm this should do nicely<br>  <br>  Antec earthwatts EA380 380W<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817371005" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  $40 w/ free shipping (through 2/28)<br>  <br>  This power supply has a max +12v combined capacity of 324W  <a href="http://c1.neweggimages.com/NeweggImage/productimage/17-371-005-04.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://c1.neweggimages.com/NeweggImage/p...</a>  which is more than a "typical" 9600gt system is ever going to need, YMMV, more than enough for my example system.  I usually recommend having *at least* your whole system demand being covered by your +12v power alone for longevity reasons.  The EA380 has you covered and then some.  The 80+ efficiency gives it a bit of an edge over the FSP/Basiq, if you are into the whole green pc thing (or running 24x7 :)<br>  <br>  Not to mention, Seasonic is the OEM for this model which has a +12v single rail PSU design, despite the fact it mentions 2 x 12v rails (they lead to the same solder points on the psu board).<br>  <br>  I would trust it.  I have one, got a similiar deal last year on the 'egg, powers my E2180/945 msi OC'd w/ 4 x hdd / 1 x dvdrw linux workstation 24x7, it's a good unit.<br>  <br>  <br>  cheers|`|g65tuqwRaa	I don't think you'd be able to buy anything efficient that could run the 9600GT since the minimum power supply needed for that card is 400W, you'd need to spend more money on your PSU.|`|PYF8cYtqaa	im sure this will help u bro<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/category/category_slc.asp?Recs=10&Nav=|c:106|lp:25:hp:49.99|&Sort=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/...</a>|`|2vL8wOHZaa	Go with Antec Basiq 500W.

0Iyqf6Glaa	The wireless router will provide a web-based administration interface that you can connect to in order to configure it and check on the status of the network.  One thing which you'll be able to see prominently is a list of the machines connected into your home network via wireless ethernet (802.11).  You should recognize all of the machines in the list.<br>  <br>  If you have neighbors where you live, I would recommend enabling security on the wireless network.  This would be configured via the same web interface.  The basic implementation of wireless network security simply requires the would-be connector to know whatever password you put into the device in order to connect.  It also encrypts wireless network traffic.|`|FBQZ06vraa	Somewhere in the router's administration pages there should be a table showing what computers are connected.  Browse it occasionally and see if someone uninvited happens to be there.<br>  <br>  Note also that showing up in that table doesn't always mean they're currently connected.  The table may just reflect who has "leased" an IP address in the last 24 hours.<br>  <br>  Finding them is another story.|`|ZHhi8vSjaa	just set the security settings and password to protect it hope this helps|`|zNS2zF2Daa	The only way to truly know if someone is stealing is to login to the router by opening a browser, typing in the default gateway in the URL, and viewing "Attached Devices". If you cannot identify each attached device, then someone is stealing from you. This will tell you even if someone has hacked your password. Sounds like it is time to upgrade your Wireless Security, if you aren't using WPA-PSK. I hope your neighbors aren't hackers.|`|OwL61EI8aa	You can try reviewing your router/firewall logs but unless you know what to look for it's probably not going to be of much help.

0Iyqf6Glaa	If you have (or need to create) a small private network of business computers and you need to allow those computers to have Internet access, then in addition to your Internet service itself, the correct solution is to purchase a firewall with a built-in Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.<br>  <br>  NAT is the standard solution to the problem of providing a gateway between an internal corporate network and the Internet.  It's relied upon by companies small and large which choose not to pay for individual Internet IP addresses for each computer within the business.<br>  <br>  Pretty much all modern firewalls have built-in NAT functionality allowing them to double as gateways.  Another nice feature which most have is a built-in Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server.  DHCP usage is less common in business and is not essential like NAT, but it can be a convenient feature in that it allows your internal network to mostly configure its own network settings.<br>  <br>  If you have Internet service and a modern firewall with built-in NAT gateway and DHCP server functionality, then the only additional piece of hardware which you'd need to set up a rudimentary small network is a simple switch to interconnect the various devices including the computers and the firewall.<br>  <br>  Firewalls in the SOHO sector include the "Sonicwall SOHO" and the "Checkpoint Safe@Office".  Either one of these firewalls will allow the type of connection sharing you're describing.  One step up from the SOHO sector is the SMB sector with other products.  The Cisco PIX line of devices is one of the most common in business.<br>  <br>  A quick search suggests that some of these devices can be had for as little as a few hundred dollars.  That's probably the minimum-grade solution you should consider when thinking about putting business data in close proximity to the Internet.<br>  <br>  If that kind of spending is out of the question currently, you could use consumer-grade equipment designed to achieve connection sharing in residential settings.  Technically these products work the exact same way, at least in respect to the very-limited set of functionalities which I've described here.  I won't mention specific products in that market segment, but any consumer electronics salesperson can steer you in the right direction.  In the consumer sector, the devices are branded as "routers" but technically that's a misnomer since the task at hand is to gateway between two networks, not route within one.<br>  <br>  One thing to keep in mind is that your Internet Service Provider might be able to provide and support a business-appropriate firewall/gateway device together with its business-class Internet service.  If that's the case, it's definitely something to consider since it's nice to have technical support and a failed hardware replacement agreement available for critical infrastructure.  It also prevents the Internet Service Provider's support team from giving you pushback (e.g. "that sounds like a firewall issue, you better check with your firewall support")  during times when you're in need of help.<br>  <br>  You mentioned that you intend to use a low-cost Internet service.  Low cost is good, but be sure that whatever service you purchase is recognized as a business-grade service by the provider.  You should never try to sneak by with a residential-grade service for a business because residential service is generally provided with something like a 48-hour SLA if any whereas a business circuit generally comes with a 4-hour response guarantee in case of outage.|`|rMSJ6Gqcaa	Just use a ROUTER <br>  Either a WIRED ROUTER - (You have to connect Ethernet Cords to each pc and then every pc connects into the WIRED ROUTER)<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  WIRELESS ROUTER (Each pc can be wirelessly connected to the internet through the WIRELESS ROUTER) No need for all of the ETHERNET CORDS everywhere.<br>  <br>  TOTAL COST??

96pPbeeIaa	if your using a ps2 (not usb) keyboard try using a usb keyboard and vice versa. it happend to me once... damn acer... if that doesn't work you may have to send it to a qualified computer technician|`|014287bf0c7cb683db25fa06a4da3073aa	First, with the keyboard, try disconnecting and reconnecting the keyboard. It sounds stupid, but you may have knocked it loose without even knowing it. The tiniest bump can throw it off. If that doesn't work, try another keyboard.<br>  <br>  Once you get the keyboard working, simply load the Windows CD and try the repair process. If it doesn't work (it never does), try the restore CDs that came with your PC. They may give you the option to try and repair the computer, reinstall Windows, or both. Go with the repair first. If that doesn't work, then you will have to reinstall Windows.
18VdvhtHaa	Sex.  Girls.  Kissing.|`|FONse7Ijaa	Um... the title should just be something relevant to the content of the video.  You don't get views from the title.... you get views from the quality and content of the video.|`|idNLewPDaa	heres a way to get 100 free views, and you can do it more than once:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Utx58g9mN0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Utx58g9m...</a>|`|1EN9ngsbaa	Well, knowing nothing about the video, that is a hard question.  Maybe you should try the following:<br>  <br>  You should try to be really good with tags. I mean, dont just put in "fireworks, explosion" if your video is about fireworks. Try to use all types of things, like "fireworks, Explosion, colorful, pattern, night, time, dark fire, launch, sparks" stuff like that.<br>  <br>  And it would also help to have a great title. Something like "Fourth of July Fireworks" probaly wont rack in alot of views. Something like "Fireworks are pretty..." would probaly get more, but not as many as "I LIGHT THINGS ON FIRE!" Just make sure not to lie to your viewers, but if you really do lit the fireworks off, that would be an appropriate title.<br>  <br>  Another great thing to do it to have a great thumbnail. I disagree throughly with people who put something like a women with her shirt almost off as the thumbnail, because most of the time that has nothing to do with the video. Most of the time they just times it there so it would flash for a second, then continue on with the video. What YOU should do is if your video is about fireworks, and you names it "I LIGHT THINGS ON FIRE!" then maybe the middle frame should be you with a lighter on next to your face. Something to get viewers to go "ot oh, what is that guy going to do?" Just make sure that that lighter part is legitinmetly about your video.<br>  <br>  One of the best things to do is to make your video a response to a very popular video, or to a new video that might not have alot of views yet, but their subscriber count is high. <br>  <br>  For example, if you make a video talking about some bizzare news story, and sXephil, A popular youtuber, mentions the same story in his video, make it a video response to it. With a good thumbnail, it should rack in the viewers. Or if your video is a video about how to do something, like make something, or a trick on the computer, make your video a repsonse to one of householdhacker new video.<br>  <br>  If you do want to have an extra boost in your video veiws, you could use an atuo refrsher. mind you, THIS IS AGAINST THE YOUTUBE RULES. if youtube catches you, you could get suspened or even banned. to download a atuop refresher, click here: <a href="http://www.download.com/AutoRefresher-fo..." rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/AutoRefresher-fo...</a><br>  <br>  There is a quick and easy way to get more channel views though, and this IS legal, it is for now anyways. they might soon change that. but you can download a channel refrsher if you want. to learn more about it, watch this video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKwFC_aZk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKwFC_aZk...</a><br>  <br>  It also helps to have external links from youtube.
