I'm interested to know who really deserves this accolade. I'm sure that it's controversial, as what constitutes "greatness" is very personal.      Please DON'T answer with Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Napoleon etc.... they were generals, not soldiers.      I'm looking only for soldiers/warriors who have achieved feats of bravery, daring and cunning that we would only expect of the Gods.      E.g. Simo Hayha, the Finnish sniper who shot over 700 Russians in 100 days.      Let the Battle commence...

20090205012353AA0NtmU	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	"   I s  T h e r e  N o  S u c h  T h i n g   "?	Sharing yourself means borrowing,   against the shares of your will;   it helps if your bank is full,   when the time comes for the bill.      There's no such thing as complete,   when a part of you is lost;   and no such thing as final,   when you cannot bear the cost.      Finding the past that's hidden,   is an elemental goal;   and forgiveness brings the change,   which is cleansing for the soul.         There's no such thing as freedom,   if you want your heart to share;   and no such thing as always,   if you cannot really care.      There's no such thing as happy,   when inside you there's no pride;   as each step of life you climb,   makes the distance seem too wide.      Each venture into romance,   is an answer for a thirst;   accepting the one you love,   means a love of yourself first.

20090204164751AAyfH2T	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Have ever read a Hemingway poem?	I posted a Q this morning asking how  you poets find your ideas. I wondered if we had similar techniques.  I asked because of a poem I wrote.  A very simple one, no biggy, but one of my favorites.   One of those that just comes to ya and goesssss.         Down in Michigan      Hemingway wrote a short story titled, “Up in Michigan.”  I have wanted to write a poem and title it Down in Michigan, so I did.  A simple poem.      He had river, a dock, some fish, a woman, silence, (just like in all of his stories, right?).   I had creek, dock, fish, a silent woman, a man, and quiet.   Those are the only similarities.      Once, my late husband and I drove to visit his mother.  Along the way we stopped by a river and had a glass of Sauternes. There was no dock, we sat on the ground.   I didn’t see any fish, we didn’t eat cheese, crackers, or apples.  There were no chatty leaves, just us chatting.      My poem is based a tad of truth with a whole lot of fiction.  And that is how I wrote my last poem.  It was all about the poem.  Remember when Buc asked if it’s all about the poem.  This was all about the poem..      I don’t know how to link it, but if someone wants to tell me, I will.
20090204165553AAyf3kS	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Constructive criticism time...?	I have just finished a poem, and I would like someone else's opinion on it. It's not for school, just to let off some sheltered emotions. :D      Darkness      I find myself sinking into a bottomless pit of quick sand,     Hoping to find a way out.    Searching for a ledge to climb, a ridge to scale,    All I come up with is dirt beneath my nails, and a mind overflowing with doubt.     While despair floods into my heart, my skin begins to pale.       Crouching like a helpless animal; dazed and confused,     I sit against the dark cold wall looking up at the stars.    Do stars ever feel anguish, do they ever feel used?    I wait there in silence for them to answer my plea.       I’ve spent three days lying in this hollow,    Responding to my own questions.     I let out a small sigh, and try to swallow.   Unable to escape—unwilling to.       Feeling a bit desperate, I try something fresh,   I feel the ground that has cushioned me,   That has longed to take me in its flesh.    And I start to dig.       Halfway down I have a realization,    My hands seize, and my eyes close,    How far down must I go must I tunnel?   To realize that I’ve gone to far…

20090204170227AA6KUQs	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	My poem.....Untitled (And it basically sucks!) Any opinions?	This is my first poem that I have written except for a school assignment. It's pretty bad, but oh well.      She lifts her head, glancing around   Through her designer sunglasses, you can see her eyes.   The eyes that seem to burn holes in people’s backs.   The eyes that are grey and smoldering like fire.   So intense that no one dares to defy her.   She snaps her perfectly manicured fingers and a pool boy comes to her side.    “Mint infused water.”   No please, no smile. She gets what she wants, without them.   No one refuses a beauty.   She purses her lips and taps her foot impatiently.   When the water comes, she takes a small sip.   Adjusting her sundress, she stands up.   Standing with poise and perfect posture, she walks over to the small bridge.   Taking a camera from her tote bag, she snaps a picture.   Everyone around her stops and begins to watch.   She smiles and ties her curly blond hair into a messy ponytail.   She takes her expensive wedge heels off slowly.   As she pushes her sunglasses up onto her head her eyes begin to glisten.   The smile that is rarely seen comes out, showing her perfectly straight, white teeth.   She snaps another picture, this one of the waterfall, of the rocks gleaming in the water.   She walks across the bridge, into the shaded area, taking pictures the whole way.   The people around her stare, shocked.   This beautiful, arrogant, selfish girl is a photographer?   She takes pictures?   One brave child walks up to her.   “Excuse me girl, can I see your pictures?”   The boy’s parents brace themselves, waiting her attack on their son.   She grins and pulls a stack of photos out of her bag, a pile bound with a rubber band.   He looks quickly through and smiles.    She hands him a few, and sends him back to his parents.   The young boy shows his parents, and they are speechless.   Nobody could have imagined the talent of this young girl.   She couldn’t have been more than 15 or 16, and yet her work was   Her work was breathtaking.    She caught every detail, an image captured forever on paper.    The trees, the small blades of grass.   She had some of crowds of people, showing the diversity of them.   And as that young girl walked away from the pool, she turned for one final glance.   And captured the boy and his parents in a tight embrace, capturing their love.         What do you think of it?
20090204140403AAmg7l1	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Can anyone help me with some literary elements in this sonnet? (10 points!)?	does it have alliteration, imagery, irony,, symbolism or anything else?   what is the meter?   foot?  rhyme scheme?  or anything you can find, examples?/ support?      Suicide, by Edgar Fawcett        Invisible as a wind along the sky,    She ever wanders o'er the earth immense,    A spirit of beauty but malevolence,    With foot unechoing and with furtive eye.    She loathes and shuns all haunts where peace may lie,    Or love, and every joy engendered thence,    Yet prowls to wait, with wary and avid sense,    For sorrow's heaviest and most burning sigh!    Then, when some dreary sufferer darkly fails    To find in life's chill heaven one starry trace,    One hope no menace of despair assails,    Toward him she steals with sure insidious pace,    And slowly to his desperate look unveils    The maddening glooms and splendours of her face!

20060814001218AA8Hj7A	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	?Qué es hoy la Filosofía?	La pregunta no es retórica, es casi un desafío. Si bien los filósofos decimonónicos no tuvieron grandes inconvenientes en definirla como las disciplinas que estudiaban los problemas del Ser (Metafísica), del Conocimiento (Gnoseología) y de los Valores (Axiología), no estaría mal separar hoy la paja del trigo, tanto como para que en este foro no se crea que "Filosofía" es hablar acerca de la amistad o repetir aforismos de dudosa veracidad y de nula utilidad. Hace falta una definición que no sea ya obsoleta.

Me being the eager-beaver that I am, I wanted to get started right away!    I just wanted your opinion on it, and want you to critique me if you think it needs critique! Any comments accepted. I am just looking for constructive criticism! Thanx.      High School Bathrooms,    Can hold a lot.   Especially for those,   who like to smoke pot.   We smoke and smoke and smoke all day,   thinking, "getting high is the way".   To live our lives with fun and love,    we can never get enough.   I started smoking,   when I was 14.   Getting high,   felt like a dream.   One night I smoked,   so much at a party,   I didn't end up where I started.   I was almost 15.   I went off with this guy.   Into a room,    and he turned off the lights.   I was so high,   didn't know what I was doing,   I was so young,   just started growing.   We flopped on the floor,   He took off his clothes.   Kissed me all over,   and whipped out his hose.   The rest is history,   never coming back,   Pot + Teens = TROUBLE   Do the math.   Losing my virginity,   to a 17 year old guy,   when I was 14,   just doesn't seem right.   My advice to you,   just don't ever do it.   It will screw up your life,   this is my story,   to prove it.
20090205020010AAxArIF	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I Wrote This Poem When I Was 8?	Hi I Wrote This When I Was Young, About 8 Or Somthing Its Not Good But Hear IT Goes [Please Comment It]:                           “Ok Lights out!” called the general walking past our cabin.         “I just started it” Coda said.         “Finish that sentence then get to bed”         With the watchful eyes of his roommates he wrote.         The Ground is covered with blood and bodies on the ground.          How they lie there and not make a sound.         Some call out with a cry of pain…..         Knowing the call was in vain!         When They Hit the Ground they scream, their blood flows like a stream         Scared soldiers begin to cry watching as their friends die…         When finally the last shot is fired, all of the soldiers are weak and tired.         The only thing that warms your bones is knowing you might turn home.         As you sleep for your next war you slowly close your eyes….. Not knowing if you will be the next to die.         Do not worry If I Do die my love I want you to kno how MUCH you meen to me if I do not return I wish you…         “That’s enough!” my general said spitting on Codas paper. Picking it up and walking out the door he called “Learn to spell you dumb idiot”                           So What Do Ya Think, I Was Young [BTW The Spelling Mistakes Are On Purpose!]          i don't like it but for an 8 year old WOW!

Truly    It was a cloudy rainy day as we drove away sad  Coming home from the pound still alone  I was sure this time a puppy I would have  but my arms still were vacant towards home   It had been years now since our last ran away  A day in time I'll never forget   I left the gate wide what more could I say   He slipped through from my life with regret  My mistake I have lived with for many nights now   If only I could be granted the chance  I'm older now and with more love in my heart   With responsibility truly enhanced  Then a call came through from the pound it was true  Saying we believe it is what you're looking for  It wasn't the one I had lost years ago but another I was so longing for  We drove right down I had now lost that frown just thinking of what it could be   It was a collie it's true like the one I once knew when the gate was left open by me He had come back to me in a young version it seems  All I could do to not let myself cry   It was a cloudy rainy day but not in the same way as we drove away for the last time  A true 2nd chance won't let me fall into trance  And this time I will most truly try  I thought what to do to not let this fall through   And a gate lock is the 1st thing I'll buy  Laddie I love you and wont let anything happen to you  it's true
20090204163948AAY2jU7	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Yes. No. Maybe. (Opinion at the end.)?	I have loved him since 2nd grade. I am in 7th now. Don't say I don't know what love is. Because I do.It's that feeling you get when some one enters the room. You feel free when he smiles at you. You feel like its only you and him when he speaks. You feel like the world stops for a second or two when he only looks a you. That how strong feel. You get butterflies when he laughs. You feel ecstatic when he waits for you at your locker. You feel like your in heaven when he helps you with math. You feel like you can't stop smiling when he flirts.  But does this mean he loves you back? No. Yes. Maybe. Are we meant for each other? No. Yes. Maybe. Does he feel the same way I do? No. Yes. Maybe.         Hi... My name is Logan. I'm in the 7th grade. No joke. I have always loved poetry and this is my newest writing. I always thought my poetry was dumb, and would never be takin seriously. But my friend convinced me to put it on yahoo and get some opinions from others who don't know me. That means you don't have to lie. please... please... please tell me the truth.

In a wasteland of sorrow; with my back turned from your face.   I thought I was living all life is; that’s what I said.   To find I was mistaken, I was already dead.   It was just like a sparkle, just a glimpse in my heart.   My soul was attracted, with me unknowing that this was the start.   I found you yes Jesus, you welcomed me in.   You wiped away all my sorrow; and released me from sin.   You picked me up and he hugged me, and kissed me on my head.   My body started to tingle; it was my soul that you fed.   I looked in your eyes and you started to say.   I love you so much, on my shoulders your sins will lay.   And I’ll always be with you; I’m right by your side.   And soon will be together, until then; through me, live your life…

Suicide, by Edgar Fawcett        Invisible as a wind along the sky,    She ever wanders o'er the earth immense,    A spirit of beauty but malevolence,    With foot unechoing and with furtive eye.    She loathes and shuns all haunts where peace may lie,    Or love, and every joy engendered thence,    Yet prowls to wait, with wary and avid sense,    For sorrow's heaviest and most burning sigh!    Then, when some dreary sufferer darkly fails    To find in life's chill heaven one starry trace,    One hope no menace of despair assails,    Toward him she steals with sure insidious pace,    And slowly to his desperate look unveils    The maddening glooms and splendours of her face!

20090204222457AA9IGte	Arts & Humanities;History	What is the danger of lenin's idea of party leadership?	Here's what we are supposed to gather the information from....      Vladimir Lenin was one of the century’s most   important leaders. Unhappy and disillusioned   with the Russian monarchy, he led a group called   the Bolsheviks in a revolution that gave him control   of the largest nation in the world.   Born in 1870, Lenin was raised by two educated   parents in a happy family. He showed intelligence   and skill with classical languages. While in his   teens, two shocks jolted his world. First, his father   was threatened with losing his job by the government.   Second, Lenin’s older brother was hanged   for conspiring against the czar. Within two years,   Lenin had read the work of Karl Marx and believed   that Russia needed a Communist revolution.   Lenin then began to write and to recruit new   followers. He was arrested and served 15 months in   prison followed by three years of exile in Siberia.   When that ended in 1900, he traveled abroad,   where he spent much of the next 17 years. During   this time, he sharpened his ideas about Marxism.   Marxism said that industrial workers, called the   proletariat, were in a struggle against capitalists, the   people that owned businesses. Eventually, Marx   said, the workers would overthrow the capitalists   and form a new society called communism. However,   Russia consisted mainly of peasants and only had a   small number of industrial workers. Marxists wondered   how a workers’ revolution could occur.   Lenin saw the role of the party as essential, and   his group became known as the Bolsheviks. The   Bolsheviks, he said, would lead the people to the   revolution they needed. However, many Marxists   found it difficult to accept Lenin’s iron rule. In 1912,   he forced those who disagreed with him out of the   party. World War I brought another crisis. Communists   all over Europe ignored class loyalty and chose to   fight for their country instead. They joined their   nations’ armies to fight each other—not the capitalists.   Lenin said that the war would help capitalists   profit while workers suffered. He urged that   Communists “transform the imperialist war into a   civil war.”   As the war continued, the Russian people suffered   terribly. In March 1917, hungry, angry workers   and soldiers overthrew the czar. Lenin and his supporters   won permission from Germany to travel   through German lands back to Russia.   Lenin accepted the new temporary government   but said that it was not revolutionary enough. He   urged that power go to the soviets, which were   councils of workers set up in many cities. His position   grew dangerous. He was branded a German   agent and was forced to live in hiding in Finland.   From that base, he issued a stream of writings urging   immediate Russian withdrawal from the war and   for the government to give land and bread to the   people. These cries gained popularity. In late   October, he returned to Russia, disguised for his   safety. He persuaded the party’s leaders that it was   time to overthrow the provisional government but   watched with alarm as no steps were taken. Finally,   on November 7, 1917, the Bolsheviks overthrew   the temporary government. The soviets chose the   47-year-old Lenin as their leader.   Lenin quickly made peace with Germany, giving   up large chunks of Russian territory. A civil war,   though, still raged in Russia between the Bolsheviks   and their opponents. However, Lenin’s leadership   ensured that the new government would survive.   With peace came the question of how to rule the   new state. The country was named the Union of   Soviet Socialist Republics, and the Bolsheviks   renamed themselves the Communist Party. In Lenin’s   last years, he struggled to prevent Stalin from gaining   power. Lenin became ill and died in 1924.

I'm only in 7th grade, so sorry if it sucks or anything.         The water sits still like a frozen blanket out on the frosty lake.   One woman, who traveled to hell and back, walked alone in pain and ache.   With each threatening step she took, the Earth would silently quake.   Because the woman was here for revenge - good, clean revenge.   And revenge here on Earth was the one thing that she'd take.      Her eyes were a reddish fire that would burn with just one touch.   Her face was so full of misery. Full of bitterness, regret, and such.   Her lover had left her to drown in the lake. Her heart couldn't bear very much.   The lake swirled violently when she died - black water that made her die.   Dark water that pulled her away from the boat, and loosened her weak clutch.      It was a dark and peaceful night when her lover took her on a date.   He surprised her with a beautiful boat to row around the cold lake.   But alas, a storm struck so violently, that the boat would tilt and shake.   And she lost her life to the lake water.   The foul, dark lake water.   She had fell into the pool of black death and that had been her fate.      The woods were quiet and beckoning. His cabin lay still by a tree.   A dagger glinted in her hand. Her face was overcome with glee.   For he shall die tonight. And die by the hands of she.   For it was him that she had a vacation to hell   a cold, brutal vacation to hell.   Now that mortifying experience to hell, her lover will be able to see.      His fire crackled warmly, red and orange flames so bright.   He lived in that old warm cabin; alone he was that night.   When a startling knock knock knock gave him such a fright.   His warm hands slowly turned the doorknob.   Very slowly turned the doorknob.   To see his old lover standing there, her hand raised with a knife.      The water sits still like a frozen blanket out on the frosty lake.   One woman, who traveled to hell and back, walked alone in pain and ache.   With each threatenin step she took, the Earuth would silently quake.   Because the woman had done her revenge - her harsh, cold revenge.   And this was her last day on Earth before she'd fall into the dark depths of the lake.

20090204224042AATeKqH	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my story?	Okay, now i'm sure maybe it sounds kinda stupid, but don't laugh. please. Go ahead and critize but please dont be mean about it cuz it's my first story ever. Here is part oneish:         I stared across the lawn at my friend for a moment in silence, until a string of hysterical laughter bubbled up throughout my body. I shook harder and harder, giggling uncontrollably until the blackness took hold of me. I struggled to breathe, fighting the grasp of the inevitable dark. It was fogging my vision, cutting off all my senses, until I slipped, and the night consumed me.   **************************************...    When I opened my eyes, the first thing I noticed was Lindsey peering at me while gently holding a cool, damp cloth to my forehead. A moan escaped my lips as I struggled to sit up. A single red autumn leaf fluttered to the ground. I picked it up and twirled it around absently. “How are you feeling?” Lindsey asked calmly, her raven flowing against the wind.    “Fine.” I stuttered, forcing myself to take deep breaths.    “Geez Jessie, you know I hate it when you pass out on me!” Lindsey reprimanded me.     “Yeah, I’ll work on that.” I mumbled, blushing a crimson shade of red.    “Look Jess, I’m sorry. I didn’t know you’d freak out that much.”     She looked sorry enough. “It’s okay. It’s not everyday I learn my friend has superpowers.”    “I’d better get you home before your parents start wondering where you are.” Lindsey opened her car door, and I followed.     As we drove down the winding road that leads to my house, I wondered why she had shown me her power. And what she expected me to do about it. Was I dreaming?     “Alright Jessie, see ya tomorrow. I’ll pick you up for school tomorrow kay?”    “Okay, see ya tomorrow.”    “Jessica?” My mom’s voice trilled frantically. “Jessica!”    “Chill Mom, I’m home.”     “Where were you?” My mom narrowed her eyes suspiciously.    “Just hanging out with Lindsey.” I quickly assured her.    “Isn’t she a junior?”    “Yeah.” I rolled my eyes.    “Honey, maybe you should hang out with more people your own age.”     “Mom, Jessica’s awesome. She’s an all A student. She doesn’t party. I don’t know why you’re so worried.”    “I don’t know, just she seems so… intense.”    “Well, I’m going up to my room. I need to finish my homework.”     I ran up to my room, and shut my door, then collapsed on my bed. I couldn’t get my mind off Lindsey. It couldn’t be a dream, because I remembered her stretching her hand out over a young maple tree, it wilted. Then, with me still gaping at the sight, my mouth hanging wide open, she made it grow into an old, adult tree, that stretched to the sky. A twig scratched against my arm during this process.     I examined my arm, and sure enough, found a tiny cut near my elbow. I picked up the phone sitting on my dresser, and started dialing Lindsey’s number. “Hello?” A deep voice echoed in my ears through the phone.    “Hi, um, is Lindsey there? It’s Jessica.”    “Yeah, hold on. LINDSEY! PHONE!”     “Is this Jessie?”    “Yeah.” I replied.    “Hey. I knew you couldn’t wait for tomorrow.” Lindsey sounded annoyed.    “Sorry, but you’ve gotta give me some answers!” I defended myself.

When things go silent,   I find myself thinking of you.   When things go dark,   I see your face smiling at mine.   My heart races, but tears come to my eyes.      We are at a crossroad,   Deciding whether to stay or go.   We either give this everything we have,   Or we end it for good, close this chapter.      I don’t want to look back and regret,   Just like two years ago.   But I know myself,   And I know I will think about you   Even twenty years from now,   Wondering what could have happened.      I have to take the leap.   Open my heart, eyes, ears, and soul.   Experience the closeness I want to feel,   Like no one has ever given me.      Before, I ran away, moved away,   From anyone who got too close.   I was horribly afraid of opening up.   But now with you, I feel different.   I am ready to take a risk   And throw my reservations aside.      You think my opinions are strong,   They are.   What you don’t know?   That I am willing to put my beliefs aside   Just so that I can support yours.   To make this relationship work.      I know the hardship, I get it.   What relationship isn’t hard?   Religion is important to you,   It’s a part of you, a part I like.   You are passionate about your beliefs.   Why would I try to change that?      We aren’t married, we don’t have kids.   Why are you thinking so far ahead?   Stop living in the future, live in the moment.   I am right here waiting,   But I can’t wait forever.

20090204224326AAmCvcQ	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What's your opinion on this short oral on an entertaining story about my life?	My task is to give a short oral on something funny/embarrassing/entertaining that has happened to me. I'd really like some opinions and improvements. I'm not known for my comedic skills so any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.      Good afternoon class and Mrs. Buick. I’m here today to tell you a short, entertaining story about myself. I have chosen the following because my life stories are about as entertaining as an Antique Roadshows marathon so I found choosing a funny story really hard!       This incident occurred around 4 years ago, when I was still living in New South Wales. I attended Grafton Public School and every month we would have a huge school disco. This disco was going to be my final one before I moved. I asked my dad to pick me up at the end.        So I went to the disco that night and had a great time. At the end all the school kids have to line up along the school fence and identify their parents before they could leave.  I searched the crowd for my dad. And there he was standing there looking for me wearing ugg boots and his daggiest pyjamas, covered in dogs and to top it off he had his pants pulled up to his bellybutton. I looked away quickly and as I did he came closer to the gate. The teacher asked if I could see my parent so I just kinda pointed at a bunch of people to the left of my dad.       Then all of a sudden I hear him yelling my name really loudly. I ignored him hoping he’d give up but he didn’t. He got as close as possible and then the arms started to wave around frantically trying to get my attention, by this time he’d already gotten 90% of the schools attention by yelling my name repeatedly and as loud as possible. I finally gave up and told the teacher he was my dad. As soon as we were in the car, I told him how embarrassing he was and he looked at me and shook his head “dads like me don’t grow on trees you know” and he was probably right, they usually swing beneath them! Thanks for listening.

20090205010859AAo4iQb	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I have two questions about Twilight haters and lovers...?	To the haters: Why are you so obsessed with hating this series of books? It seems like there are multiple questions on every page about how much they hate the books. Why waste time like that?      To the Lovers: Why are you completely obsessed with the book?       I honestly think I'm more tired of the Twilight haters and complainers than the actual fans. At least the real fans have good reason at their annoyance. Both haters and lovers are way over the top with this book. I'm reading it now (I'm on Eclipse), I can't see why they are completely obsessed, but I also think the haters should give it a break.       Bonus Question: Why is this book talked about more than anything else in this world? Why? I don't get it?       Added side note: I'm not trying to be mean to both party's, I just really want to know what all of the hype is about. So I figured I would ask both the haters and lovers. Thanks for understanding. All opinions welcome, please have good reason though. Don't just say "it sucks" because that is NOT a real answer.

In the middle of the woods I sit down in the rain.      Eyes locked on a dirt road; I think of all my pain.      I always wonder..... where I will be? and where will I end up?      A demon in my heart has gotten me broken down and I'm bending up.      My mom was crazy though..maybe her mentalness came off.      Thought I had ran away, but yet I'm still facing the same boss.      Sword in my lap as I sit and stare and wonder      Its getting dark; I think the night will fill with noise and thunder.            I toss my sword and look up at the sky; my hands out.      As I'm asking what is this life all about.      And then I thank him..for lettingn me get it....figured it out.      This is my card...... and autumn leaves must fall down.      It feels so good .... to be the one.....figured it out/      my hands out....... I'm watching all them leaves fall down.      Rain and thunder..deep in my heart...figured it out.

20090205001416AALHjwa	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What is the required length of a novel have to be?	How long does a novel have to be? Does it have exceed a certain amount of pages? I notice many novels are very large in size. And if not, they are put onto smaller pages for the tiny books, lol. I am writing a story, and it is very good and lengthily but if printed on typical paper (printing paper, lined) it wont go over 30 pages. I have other stories of the same type that are like so, I guess you can call them mini novels or short stories? But I was thinking of combing the stories one after the other, via chapters; several stories in one book. Like a collection of stories. If so, can I add a chapter within the stories, and then state when a new story is coming up?
20090205001018AAu7ZiE	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	When to make a chapter, and Q on Conversations.?	I am writing a novel and I do fine, I just write it all out, but I have trouble with the technique of chapters and outlines at times. My most questioned question, is when to move on to a new chapter? Or can I complete a novel without a chapters at all? I see this in some books.      As I focus on different books, all novels, they are laid out differently on how the indention is concerned. Tell me if the below is acceptable as an example:      (note= Where it is meant to be indented, I will type TAB by it.)      (TAB) Jake walked down the dark alley, he then suddenly heard a large thumb from behind. He turned around to catch the quick sight of a man fall from the roof tops and crash into a trash pile below. He approached the man and asked;      (TAB) "Are you okay?"   (TAB) The odd man stood from the pile of garbage, unharmed, and looked around the area. He gazed immensely at the tall buildings and the night sky. Jake looked on, not sure of the man's intentions, wondered what was on his mind, and most of all; how this man is unharmed from the 40 ft. fall.       Does the above seem right? Or when it comes to basic description do I let it be tabbed and then for conversation, simply let it be without indenting? Or does every new line of conversing have to be treated like a paragraph?

20090205000423AA0vgVC	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Question about Alvin Plantinga?	I've only read one of Plantinga's books, so I'm fairly unfamiliar with some of his arguments, but from what I can gather, Plantinga, on the one hand, argues that there are not really any arguments that provide strong evidence for God's existence, but, on the other hand, belief in God is rational because it is properly basic (and this is the bit I haven't read much about).    My question is this: Even if theism is rational, why be a theist? After all, something may be rational yet not the most probable, right? Or is it that if  theism is rational, then atheism is irrational, meaning theism is the better position to take? In other words, I want to understand why Plantinga thinks a theist should be a theist.    For example, assume there are two rational hypotheses, and it cannot be determined which one is more probable. How does one decide what hypotheses to choose? Or should he not bother choosing in the first place?

20090204231048AAVEcKD	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How do you feel about giving/receiving books with remainder marks?	Usually it is a new book but maybe a *little* dated.

I never really viewed receiving/giving a 'new' book with subtle markings as cheap. I was wondering what others think or have experienced.

To be alive or not to be            I live in your eyes, hidden from your senses   I have passed in your every second, hidden from your eyes   Lonely as ever, I continue to survive on your love      The scares on my heart have made me cold   Yet I can feel the warmth of your love   My hands can’t hold you, but my eyes still want your light      I am today, I will be tomorrow I am in moments I am in centuries   I will play in your smile, I will dance with your fragrance     I will go away, I will come close   In silence and in prayers…….your heart will remember me   I will be remembered, I will be remembered
20090205000029AAecTQB	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Why does time move forward?	Wouldn't it be much more interesting if it moved backwards?  That way you get the growing old part done early.  And as you get older (physically younger) you will have experience, most likely money, and when you retire at around 20 or so you can do and are capable of doing all the fun things older people try to do in their golden years.  It sounds like something I would want at least.

20090204235615AAS7318	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	How do you like my poem?	fragment of a soul I remain aloft,     alive without breathing,     cold to the touch,    inhale my scent,     take me in,     allow me to permeate what you are,     change who youve been,     undoing the things,     that have been done to you,     I stroke down your spine,     moving,     always moving,    whimpering slightly,     afraid to think,     I lay down before you,     invite you to drink,     the invisible is broken,     sight,    no more,     uncoiling,     writhing,     forever,     no more.     the wrist is the answer,     scarred and broken,     the tears have to limits,     the memories have spoken,     replaced in my heart by something much less,     I hate, hate, hate this.     I hate, hate, hate it.     The poundings not normal,     not to anyone,     I hear your excuses,     I hear the drip drip drip.     Pull back to my eyes,     that were once euphoric,     Im letting the steadiness wash over me,     breathe,    dont stop breathing,     take my hand,     cradle it,     always cradle it,     the pieces rush away,     always hiding,     the source of my fears,     Inhale Exhale,     a million hopes,     dreams,     desires,     evaporate.     why,     without you,    why why why?     youve left,     now Im alone,     all alone.     expected to live.     not to live,     I cant live,    unending sadness.     sadness sadness.     Its everywhere, this sadness.     Undoing what Ive strived for,     evaporating what once was.     My hollow heart,     my black heart,     take this back,     this terrible gift,     dont allow it to fester,     as it did on my wrist,     the pounding,    the pounding,     it might be a fist,     unaware of the surroundings,     just give me a kiss,     the departure is inevitable,     the decision is set,     I start towards you,     the steel aside,     alone,     alone,     alone.     Its rushing again,     it always rushes,     by me,     unaware of the past,     the future,     the dead,     here it comes,     this fragment of pain,     straighten your back, allow it to reign.     Pushing backwards,     and backwards,     and backwards again.     Unable to get the thoughts of you out my head,     the guns,     the ideas,     I reject them,     all.     Youre undoing it all!     Return to me,     my soul,     my light,     allow me to laugh,     to fight,     I love you forever,     never will it change,     your departure destroyed me,     at a never-ending pace,     turning me into,     something,     I was never before,     the torrential downpour,     of tears,     of fears,     without you,     inhale,     without you,     I will live without you,     please dont make me live without you.    It's pretty angsty, eh?

How do I know if I am entitled to a Greek passport (Greek citizenship)?      One must have at least one ancestor who was born in Greece and therefore was Greek by birth.      4. How can I prove that one of my ancestors was/is Greek by birth?      The ancestor must be registered at the records of the Municipality (City Hall) of a town or village in Greece. Only certificates issued by Greek municipal authorities are accepted. Therefore, a certificate issued by another country stating that the ancestor in question was born in Greece is not enough for the Greek authorities.      5. What else do I need in order to become a Greek citizen?      Apart form the birth certificate (or municipal record) of the Greek ancestor, we need his/her marriage certificate, the birth certificate of their child, etc., until we reach the present applicant. All foreign documents must be officially translated in Greek.      6. Do I have to travel to Greece in order to submit the application?      Not necessarily. All the paperwork can be collected and submitted to the responsible Greek agency via a proxy, who will hold a specific power of attorney.   Source(s):    http://www.helleniccomserve.com/greekpas...

I sat there will blood stained hands holding the blonde haired girls eyes closed, hands tied behind her back I put her on the bed, and brainwashed her. She would never know of any of this. When she passed out, I drug her to her moms house, I had already killed her sister and father, but or some reason couldn't find the will to kill this girl. I sat on the rooftop thinking about what I had done, I wanted to change, I had to change. I wanted my life to be over with but that was 1000 years away, why did we have to age slowly?   5 years later (I wont put this inthere just a rReferencefor you.)   As the black haired beauty sat by me on the plain, I sense something ffamiliarabout her. Her eyes were blood shot, and she looked like she had never smiled in her life. "What is your name?" I asked.   "Octavia." She rreplied   and I knew I was screwed what was she doing back here? She should be with her mom still. I guess she was 18 though. Did she have such a bad life? She looked liked she had been living in hell, and the burn marks on her skin reminded me of he horrid past.

20090204232425AAZkOLY	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	My story (20 characters rule)?	Do you like it so far? I have written a bit from later on in the story, but this is all I have for the beginning. Sorry it's so long, but what do you think?      To anyone who passed by it would have seemed very strange to see two skinny legs dangling out from the leafy branches of a tree. However, no one ever went down there. There was only one house anywhere near that tree. Penelope, the girl who owned the pair of legs lived there. Her father couldn’t seem to stand the sight of his daughter so he never went past the back garden if he could help it. That suited Penelope just fine. It gave her a chance to think and read. She loved to read, especially fantasy stories. When she read them she could escape all of life’s troubles, even if just for a short time. But reality always came a calling; this time in the form of her father bellowing from the back gate.   “Penelope! Come home right now!”   Penelope snapped her book shut and jumped down from the tree. She could see now that the sun was setting – no wonder her dad was angry. He had rules about everything, including being home before dark. She met her father at the back gate.   “How many times do I have to tell you the rules before you start to obey them?” he shouted, his face reddening with rage.   “This’ll teach you!”   There was a loud THWACK as his hand connected with Penelope’s cheek. It stung so much and she could feel her eyes welling up with tears but Penelope would not give her father the satisfaction of seeing her cry. He said nothing, just turned and walked inside. Her father had always felt detest for Penelope. It was no secret that he had never wanted children. But he had put on an act for the public and his wife. Penelope had been an accident and when her mother announced she was pregnant again it had sent him over the edge. By the time Charlie was born, he couldn’t even look his daughter in the eyes, let alone hold his son. Then he became violent, hitting out at Penelope and her mother. It was too much for his wife, and she abandoned them; leaving Penelope to take the brunt of his anger and protect her brother.      Peering first through the window to check if the room was clear, Penelope snuck inside. She tiptoed down the hall and locked herself inside the bathroom. She turned on the taps to run a bath. The room began to fill with smoke and the sound of running water. Now that she was sure no one would hear her, she crumpled to the floor and began to cry. Her whole body shook with every sob. She hugged her knees to her chest and hid her face in her hands. Then she remembered the bath, which was nearly overflowing and leant over to turn it off. She dragged herself across the floor, her limbs flaring up with the pain of his abuse. Gripping the edge of the bathroom sink, she pulled herself up. She met her eyes in the mirror and saw her cheek was a deep purple bruise. She blinked back more tears which threatened to overflow much like the bath. She tugged off her dress, wincing as it caught the cuts and bruises that plagued her body. Standing in front of the mirror in her cotton undies her twelve-year-old body was barely recognizable under the absurd colouring her father’s beatings had left her with. She had a young girl’s figure and a child’s knobbly knees but her face and body showed more pain than adults five times her age had seen. Turning away from the ugly image before her she crossed the room and sunk into the bath. The warm water stung but soon offered relief. She sat there for what seemed like hours, but in reality was only a few minutes, staring at the bright white-tiled wall in front of her. Everything in the bathroom was so neat and tidy. Everything had its place, from the soap to the handtowel. You never would have guessed the owner of this bathroom was so out of control.
20090204230501AA0gO2Y	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my story?	This is a part of my story I'm writing and I just wanted opinions on it. It ends abruptly because it isn't finished yet. By the way, it is about Penelope preparing to run away with her baby brother Charlie.      Penelope saw her father walk past her room through the crack of light at the bottom of her door. She listened as his footsteps got further and further away. Once she could hear the shower running, she knew he’d be busy for at least half an hour. She’d already packed enough clothes to last them a week and stowed them under her bed, but they’d need food, and water too. The tiles were cold against her bare feet as she tiptoed into the kitchen. Her eyes took a moment to adjust to the dark, so she felt her way over to the fridge. The light inside blinded her as she shovelled baby food and bread into her bag as quickly and as quietly as she could. When she’d taken what she though was plenty, she headed for the laundry to grab some blankets. By now her heart was beating so hard, it felt as if it was going to burst right out of her chest! She was sure even the neighbours could hear it pounding. With that though, she realised she could no longer here the shower running, but there were footsteps growing louder by the second! She dove for cover in the tight space between the dryer and the wall. Standing in the doorway was her father, dripping wet and very, very naked. Glad that it was dark, not only so she wouldn’t be discovered but also so she couldn’t see her fathers exposed backside, Penelope watched as her dad fumbled through the cupboard for a towel.

Although problems sometimes arise   their love will never be lessened    Not now not ever.   they will always love you for these things    Forever and always.

Why? there are a host of possible answers: because other creatures have a basic right in themselves to be treated as equally valuable expressions of evolution as we humans; because our own self-interest may depend on some future use we come to make of these species or the habitats on which they depend; because we have no right to deprive future generations of their enjoyment or use of these creatures. But more important than all these is the fact that we owe it to ourselves, right here now, to fulfill our obligation to act as stewards of the heaving and mysterious multitude of life.

He saves her but she later kills herself anyway.

In the case of the woman that killed herself, the self-defense camp helped her to kill her Ex, and afterwards she felt really bad about it which is why she killed herself.     Any ideas?

20090205004151AAqFRK3	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Help! Trying to find titles to two old children's books?	First Book:           It is based off either Chinese or Japanese Mythology. Basically, there are these 5 brothers, not sure if they're monks, that travel in different directions across the world seeking 5 elements (fire, water, clouds, wood, earth??). When they find them, they bring them back to the emperor, he sends his troops out to kill them, so the brothers use the 5 elements one at a time to destroy the armies.         Second Book:        The book's title is somewhat along the lines of, "All about the big earth, the wide sky, the deep sea/ocean". The title mentions earth, sky, and sea. The book's physical size is pretty huge, so big it would have to be put lengthwise on a library shelf with the spine facing up. The book is purely informational, with no plot. It describes various facts about the earth, the sky, and the sea, and even has a section about how world religions view the cosmology of the world.      Hopefully someone knows these two titles. Thanks!

20090205011749AApVxeI	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Last summer I saturated Y/A with questions that ultimately helped save a man's life.  Could this happen again?	I didn't even know that this man existed (in a far away country), but apparently he read things that I wrote out on a nice, little forum called Yahoo Answers and decided to not end his own life. (Go figure.)  After this man and I became good friends (email buddies) he revealed this sad truth to me (his former intention to kill himself).  I broke down in tears while I sat at my computer and read this man's heartbreaking email to me.  But (after nearly 6 months of he and I corresponding back and forth with each other) this man recently ended his friendship with me because my unhappy emails to him were depressing him too much.  (He couldn't take it anymore-constantly worrying about me.)  I broke down in tears over him for the second time.    I have begun saturating Y/A with new kinds of questions and details that will reach into the core of anybody who has a sensitive, thinking mind.  Maybe I will unintentionally help save another life at the expense of my own...  I told this man (before he ended his friendship with me) that his existence was worth my 4 months of frequently excruciating physical pain (when I thought that I might be dying), and I meant the words I told him.  I can't regret what I had to suffer when my suffering inadvertently helped save my former "forever friend"'s life.  Although I am admittedly extremely self destructive, actual suicide is unacceptable to me.  Suicide is an affront to all we are as human beings.  Suicide upsets me.    But, here I am (yet again) laying in bed.  This time I'm immobilized by not only a severely sprained left foot, but also by constant numbness, muscle throbbing, and tingly sensations in my body that are likely being caused by my bulging disk that previously caused my 4 month, painful, summer ordeal.  All that previous physical pain (that led me to Y/A last summer) eventually went away, but then my body (mostly my legs) recently started feeling very weird (and my fear returned with a vengeance).  Yet again, I am laying here in my bed (where I spend most of my time).  Yet again, I am constantly writing in my journals and wondering whether there is possibly a point to any of this (or if I am just as "insane" as my former email buddy despised me calling myself)?    They say that the pen is mightier than the sword, but don't I have to be a complete "nut case" to think that my words could heal the planet-that my honest, vulnerable words could "save the world"?    Maybe if I can open the minds and hearts of just a few special individuals (make these individuals "see" what they might be blind to) I can at least help to save some souls who may (in turn) help to save me...  That is only (of course) if any of us even matter at all...

What I manage to grasp in the pages of writings about them is that Hobbes believed that men were evil in the state of nature and Rousseau thought men to be good. Both said that society turned men the way they are now. Is that true?

20090205023534AAh7z1O	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	How to take pictures of people in public in their natural behavior?	When taking pics of people in public, out of courtesy, I often feel that I must get their permissions first. But sometimes, I want to take pics of people in their natural behavior without them posing or acting consciously knowing they are being photographed. Let's say for example, if I was a researcher of urban planning and want to know how people use a public square and evaluate its performance as a communal space.....and if I want to use photographs as part of recording my observation,...how would I do this? Would sketching give me more insight than photographing? Still, it would be awkward to stare at people and draw them without their permissions if they ever catch me sketching them. Or would writing be a better way to record my observation? Regardless of methods, how can I make sure people would behave naturally as if they are not aware of my presence?

Embalming pleasures, they compared   with listening to rain in bed;   a close distance, your blissful face   so near the wet, yet thrilled and safe.      Outside: sharp winds, black-minded sleet   invent dark fortunes for the streets.      All these comforts have dissolved   today; I've no more isolation left,   no energy, no coiled surprise.       the hell of everyone is here      Drops from my bursting cherry eyes   turn every waiting sentence red.

Mostly Water      Yesterday   I was productive:   I took down notes, recorded measurements,   studied the relative angles of skylines,   determined and compared the properties of rocks      In the hope of extracting formulae for existence.      Today   my thoughts are overcast;   the words I wrote mean nothing to the sand.   Waters have shifted,   the white shoreline melts like fat in the tide.      No ordnance survey maps our present;   no graph or paragraph can ink us where we stand.

Her pain, her anguish   Finally at ease.   Over with by a knife's gentle kiss.   For he could lie no more.   Inflict his endless torture   Upon her frail body.   Never again to be at his mercy.   She stared amazed   Amazed by the reality,   The freedom she had gained.   Kneeling there in his blood   A slight smile gracing   Her battered face.   Her freedom returned   By the full moon's embrace.   Her smile, her laughter,   Like the purest song to ever be sang   Even as the warmth left her,   Faded to a chill that burned.   Still she glowed from the knowledge.   That she would hurt no more.   For in his final hour   He saw the pleasure in her eyes.   The life she once lived in her smile.   His blood coating her hands   By the light of the full harsh moon.   He saw her freedom returned.

20090205025546AARq3Bx	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Why does bad spelling and grammar annoy me so much?	I think of myself as a fairly tolerant guy but there's just something infuriating about poor (and possibly deliberately bad) spelling.      The internet is a wonderful tool but first impressions still count.  The only thing that offers any impression at all is the words people use and the way they are presented.      If that presentation is messy it is like meeting someone who hasn't showered or brushed their teeth for days - I can't help it, I recoil from them and find it hard to take anything they say seriously.      So my question to you good people is why DOES it affect me that way?

20090205035823AAomQ83	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	I'm reading John Locke's "Second Treatise of Government." But I'm a little confused...?	I'm enjoying this volume so far but I'm kind of confused when he speaks about Property in depth in Chapter V. How exactly does nature limit each of us to an equitable share of property, if that is what he is trying to get at? And how exactly does the advent of money affect those natural limits? I mean, why would John Locke support the invention of money despite the fact that it destabilizes the equitable balance that nature establishes for individuals' acquisition of property?

"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud"               I wandered lonely as a cloud   That floats on high o'er vales and hills,   When all at once I saw a crowd,   A host, of golden daffodils;   Beside the lake, beneath the trees,   Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.      Continuous as the stars that shine   And twinkle on the milky way,   They stretched in never-ending line   Along the margin of a bay:   Ten thousand saw I at a glance,   Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.      The waves beside them danced; but they   Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:   A poet could not but be gay,   In such a jocund company:   I gazed---and gazed---but little thought   What wealth the show to me had brought:      For oft, when on my couch I lie   In vacant or in pensive mood,   They flash upon that inward eye   Which is the bliss of solitude;   And then my heart with pleasure fills,   And dances with the daffodils.       William Wordsworth
