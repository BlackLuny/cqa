20090304131610AAc11er	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Pole: Should Animals Have the Same Rights as People - Do you agree 1?	Matt Prescott is director of corporate affairs for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals   (PETA; www.peta.org).      DID YOU KNOWTHAT mother hens cluck softly to their chicks that are still in their shells, that cows not only solve problems but also enjoy the challenge and become excited when they find a solution and that sheep can recognize and remember as many as 50 faces for up to two years? It seems that every week we learn more about who, rather than what, animals are.      Of course, anyone who has ever lived with a dog or cat already knows that they are unique individuals who feel joy and pain and can be frightened or sad. So, how is it that animals are still often treated as nothing more than property or machines? Chickens are crammed into tiny, filthy cages, unable to stretch their wings. Minks, raccoons and other animals spend their lives pacing in a tight circle in a tiny wire box before finally being painfully electrocuted or sometimes skinned alive for their fur. Even man’s best friend is often chained up like an old bicycle in the back yard.      Not long ago, child labor, human slavery and the oppression of women were all legal, approved practices right here in our own “enlightened” country. Some people honestly thought that other people’s interests didn’t matter. Though there was resistance, we amended our way of thinking and changed how we related to those others. Today, we are horrified at what, just a few generations ago, was considered acceptable. The time has now come for us to examine our treatment of animals.      Fortunately, no real sacrifice is required to consider animals’ interests. Making kind choices can mean eating a tasty vegetarian dish instead of one containing part of an abused chicken, buying shampoo that hasn’t been tested on rabbits’ eyes and keeping warm with clothing made from natural non-animal fibers or synthetics instead of from fur, leather or wool. For every cruel choice, there is a compassionate alternative if we just look.      Change is sometimes difficult. But in a country that values justice, we owe it to ourselves to continue learning and expanding our sphere of respect for others who are not exactly like us but who still deserve to be protected from exploitation. It’s not about radical change—it’s about basic human decency.    C    http://www.costcoconnection.com/connecti...

20090304133802AAANkxe	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	What kind of side dish would go good with this?	Sweet Chop Bake:   The next recipe is for as many chops as you want to make. Salt and pepper both sides of the chops, place in a baking dish. Top EACH chop with the following   1 tbsp brown sugar   1 tbsp ketchup   1 slice onion   1 slice lemon      Bake at 350 for about 30-45 min depending on how many chops, and how thick they are. This dish creates just a tiny bit of a nice sweet tangy sauce. You can simmer an extra serving or 2 the topping ingredients on the stove top with a little water if you would like. I serve this dish over rice also. Different sounding but very good!!!

Its a very odd situation, I can't see a constancy at all. He hates crunchy veggies like carrots, broccoli and lettuce... pretty much almost everything. I asked him what he hated the least, he said cooked tomatoes, soft onions and shredded lettuce.  That's it.      Very odd, It's like he hates regular lettuce but if its cut up he'll be able to eat it. Not by its self though it has to be on something. I'm lost, I really want to help him out.      Does anyone have any good suggestions, maybe they went through this or know someone who was like this and found a solution.      Thanks in advance!

20090227075124AAayheX	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Does Dixie Crystals Pure Cane Sugar have added bone char to enrich the white color?	i have read that many sugar providers add this to make the sugar whiter in color.         Many vegans do not consume sugar, either, because it is often whitened by animal bone   char. You can avoid sugar that is whitened by bone char by purchasing "unbleached" sugar, sugar in the raw, or beet sugar. There are some cane sugars, too, which were not whitened using bone char, but they hard to distinguish from others, unless you know the exact name brand.          http://www.recipeslovers.com/vegan-cake-...

20090227080805AAVQqnF	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Grilling eggplant-- what am I doing wrong?	I use my indoor grill pan (All-clad) to grill up a variety of vegetables, and they turn out carmelized, sweet, delicious, and I get beautiful, tasty grill marks. I use zucchini, red peppers, onions, asparagus, tomatoes, etc. I use olive oil, some salt and fresh pepper, and I use herbs sometimes.    However, when I slice up eggplant and grill it, it turns out disgusting! It absorbs all the olive oil, doesn't cook, turns out raw, and the texture is horrible. Spongy and bland. It doesn't seem to grill like the zucchini and peppers do.    How can I prepare it so that it will grill well? Does it need to be parboiled first? Should I peel it, or soak it first? Any and all suggestions will be appreciated.    As a side note, I prepare eggplant in a variety of ways- sautéed, as part of a purée, with pasta, even breaded and fried (yum!) and it's one of my favorite veggies, I would just like to know how to grill.

I've read and heard the best way to have a fresh cup is to grind your own beans (which I do), but I was wondering if taking better care of the beans before grinding would also add a lot to the richness of the cup of coffee.

So I need a few recipes that are easy, without a million ingredients, and fast enough that I can cook it when i get home around 4 or 5 and eat by 6, and the healthy part couldn't be stressed more.

I'm making an oral presentation about mexico and my partner wants to bring some mexican food to give out :]   We thought about making a Tacada (I don't know if its written right)   because our moms work all day and cant bring burritos or anything that needs to be kept warm (the presentation is in the last hour of the day; last period) Can anyone help please? Thank you!!   Also if you know any great places tourists can visit in Mexico feel free to share :) Thanks.
20090304154352AAo01u6	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	How long do I cook a 1 inch sirloin steak for medium rare?	I'm cooking it on the stove top and I don't have a pan that I can transfer to the oven so I'd like to cook it completely on the stove.   I usually BBQ them, but it's too cold out for that and I'm not sure how long to cook it on the stove top or at what temperature setting?   I have no thermometer either so I need to know the actually timing on it.   Thanks

20090304153746AALzfNr	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Vegetarians and Vegans, I have some questions?	First, before asking the questions. I am totally supportive of vegetarians and vegans. Everyone has the right to eat how they want.   I just don't understand the way SOME people think of these two topics. Please do explain? And I do not mean to be rude, I just want to know what you think about this.       If you think that no one should eat animals, what do you think would happen if no one in this world would eat meat? Animals would overpopulate and would kill us. Food chain, remember?    Their are humane ways to kill animals. We were made to eat plants and/or meat. So I don't think it's bad if someone wants to eat meat and others want to eat plants only. But instead of trying to get others to stop eating meat, why not just let them be if you don't want anything to do with meat OR try to make laws and rules that people have to treat animals right and when they are put down for food, to be put down humanely?       Also, if you are a vegetarian or vegan and are all for animals rights, but think abortion is okay? WHY?    That just doesn't make sense. If animals shouldn't be killed in cruel ways (which they shouldn't), then why would you think it's okay to abort babies? They are living and deserve to be able to live and even more important than animals.

20090304153716AA3YPOn	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Puzzling cooking issue:  Beer and burgers?	I just made beer burgers for the first time the other night using a simple, self made recipe:  soak the burgers in beer (Heineken), toss onto skillet.  Simple, easy.  But something happened that I didn't expect:  when I poured the beer into a bowl containing the ground beef, the beer seemed to break the meat down almost instantly, making it difficult to form the meat into patties, and even more difficult to keep it from falling apart while cooking it.  I am just curious as to what would cause this... and does this reaction break down the meat itself, or does it break down the fat in the meat?  Thanks a bunch!
