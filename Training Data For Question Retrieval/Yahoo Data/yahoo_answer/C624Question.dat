20090220133814AACsY4g	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding question about my best friend..?	hello, so long story short, im 18 engaged wedding in 2 years, not rushing into anything, my best friend has dated this guy 2 years, is 18 and getting married in 2 months is me or is she crazy? of course i support her.. but i am asking for opinions with no relevance to this just it sparked curiosity as to what people think of getting married at 18 upose to 20 or 25
20090220134050AAIfrJk	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do so many people think their spose or significant other is cheating?	It seems there is alot of question where people say they think their partner is cheating, or going to cheat, or thinking about cheating.      Do you think it is insecurity, general paranoia or inability to trust that causes so many people to think this, especially without any concrete reason why or proof.      Don't you think if your going to be in a long term loving relationship with someone you should trust them and give them the benefit of the doubt unless shown otherwise?
20090220134252AA3xPbY	Family & Relationships;Weddings	I'm just exhasperated with my Fiance...birthday is tomorrow, I don't think he's even THOUGHT of it...?	I am feeling really bummed about this...      My Fiance is a wonderful guy, and I love him to death. It's important to know that. He's sweet, thoughtful, and as loving as can be.      What is bugging me is that he completely disregards dates/celebrations that are important to me, like my birthday, anniversary, V-day, etc.       On V-day, I planned a sweet (not terribly expensive, but a LOT of thought) surprise for him, and spent forever thinking about doing just the right thing for him. He didn't even get me a card, and in fact, wanted to go shopping for something for HIMSELF that day.       My birthday is tomorrow. He asked me about a week ago what I wanted, and I said I'd  like to take a day trip out of town, or stay at a B&B or something.    Today he asked me, "So, what do you want to do for your birthday?" - he hasn't done/planned anything at all. I bet you $50 his plan is to ask ME where I want to go for dinner, on my birthday, and he'll just take me out, and that'll be that. Not even a card.      It just makes me sad...      On his birthday last year, I cooked a 6 course meal for him and all his friend, PLUS got him an awesome present that he'd been wanting. I just don't feel like he gives a **** about occasions like this at ALL, and puts forth no effort at all to do anything nice or planned out for me.      Am I right to be upset about this? How do I tell him this?

( myname X ) and i put him in mine. Then he took it off and replaced it with some weird chinese writing. I thought it was his name in chinese so i left it, and its really unlike him to have chinese writing in his name, as he is english lol.      Anyway today i was really bored so i translated what it meant..      '' i love you stupid ''      He NEVER EVER puts things like that. ever. and may i add he says that to me all the time, '' love you goon, gimp, dumba** and sometimes baby lol '' we argue.. its how we show eachother we care :P (is that normal? :S)      And then he changed it again, to simply.. ''i love you'' (in chinese again).      And hasnt taken it off, its there right now! My msn name always has something lovey-dovey in it and he always asks about it! could it mean he really does like me too? he always tells me he likes me and loves me and stuff but he is a popular guy. or jock.. whatever you wanna call it! so its weird for me, as im not like all the other girls he has dated.      all of his popular friends are really making the effort with me, talking, smiling and messing about etc.       what are your opinions?      Thank you xx

Now, I went to college for art (not full time, half time cos I'm still home-school at school in private room.) I really want make new friends but they were hearing, they might will learn signing when I will go college for Sep, I hope or now, maybe. But I'm bit scared about they might hate me cos I'm deaf >.> of course I can speak but sometimes not, cos sometimes I find it hard to say that, damn it. I'm sixteen, shy + quiet and never chat lots. I don't do with chavs but I'm ok with girly girls but I don't like them force or always tell me what to do, ughh. Also, I'm not alone at college, I had someone with me so she would tell me what they say to me but sometime I can understand what they say to me ^^. So, please can you tell me what to do cos I'm not good at make new friends which I really want to make new friends.      Please don't put stupid comments, all right? Please be nicee. Thanks.

20090220143709AAdnTzM	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do you do when your friends?	are all depressed?      I can't handle being the strong one any longer. I'm filled to the brim with resposibilities, work, family life etc....And my friends are bringing me down. I try to listen to them, make time for them, etc. But it's becoming too much. I still love them, but I think their depression rubs off on me--I'm not a psychologist! :(      And they do go to counselor's and take meds but I don't think it's heping (maybe it takes more time). Anyway, they're not the same ppl as they were. What do I do?! I'm about to explode.
20090220142535AApXE9o	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Was my offer to my neighbor's wife really that bad considering?	We had a neighborhood birthday party about three weeks ago and many neighbors were invited. The neighbor across the street has been laid off for about 8 months now and he has mentioned to me that they may have to foreclose on their house.   Well during the party we ran low on beer and I was going to drive to the store to get more, since I was a bit tipsy, my neighbor's wife volunteered to come with me. The way to the store she started crying and saying how she is going to miss all of the parties and friends in the neighborhood. Feeling bad, I offered her a hundred dollars and she said, what am I supposed to do for this. I should have said nothing but instead I pulled over on a back street and told her to do what's right, in which case she proceeded to.   Now when I see them I wave to them but they don't wave back and they basically ignore us. My wife is starting to ask me what is the problem and what happened.    I feel like she basically solicited me, I was trying to help them out and I'm a little upset that they are trying to turn the tables on me who is more in the wrong here?

20090220142037AAbaDBb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I should have known she didn't like me ...?	For the past few weeks a girl who's sat next to me has looked at me a lot, sort of longingly almost (as if she wanted me to talk to her) ... I was too busy talking with my other friend and working on homework, so I didn't pay her much attention;  that and I was a bit too shy to initiate convo because she's a pretty cute girl and I don't fare well in awkward situations (who does, lol)...      Anyway I was planning on actually trying to get to know her better this week, but she wasn't displaying the normal signs that she's at least curious about me.  She didn't stare at all (and we sit next to each other), so I'm a bit flustered.  Perhaps she's simply a nervous girl in general and didn't actually think anything of me?  I'm so confused, girls drive me nuts !

I said "I look terrible!" Then she said "You always look like that"(no jokingly) She's always doing this. I was sick of her and just logged off making up an excuse about having to do the laundry. As I said she is always doing this. I need a way to get revenge. It can't be too over the top and dramatic. I have to pretend to still be her friend (too long to explain)  Just subtle ways to tear her apart. Sounds sinister, I know.

I just know that if I close my eyes even for just an hour my brother will end up in my room.       -if you can see the last question it'll make more sense-       So, after I tell them, I was thinking of asking if I could stay at a friends or something until I felt safe enough to sleep.

20090220143433AAMEstG	Family & Relationships;Family	How would you approach this situation?	I will try to make this short. I have been taking my daughter over to my brother and sister in laws on Saturdays for daycare. I have been noticing more and more how much my sister in law dislikes children even though she has 2 over her own and 2 step kids. She is always has such negative things to say about my nephew (10) from my brothers previous marriage. Anyways I just found out that they were reported to DHS for child abuse. Apparently as part of my nephews punishment he was locked outside. Mind you it is mid February in Oregon. Its pretty cold out here. And this isn't the first time she has been a little harsh on his punishment. I love my brother but my daughter comes first. I plan on finding somewhere else to take her but I don't know how to approach this kind of situation without ruining my relationship with my brother. How would you handle this?

20090220143644AAOq4Vx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Everyday something strange happens between us?	I like this guy named Shane. He's in my grade and he's in 4 of my classes. I have never spoken to him. In the beginning of the year, at lunch, I had one of my male friends, Brandon, ask Shane if he had a girlfriend. Shane said no. Soon Shane found out that it was me who told Brandon to ask him the gf question. He found out that I liked him. Shane and his friends avoided me. I didn't try to get his attention after that. A couple months ago, I noticed that Shane has been looking at me A LOT inside and outside class and he started to hangout by me and my group of friends at lunch. We're outside at lunch and during the middle of lunch, Shane and his friends come out and stand a couple feet away from me. Whenever I look at him, he turns his head and looks the opposite direction. I told my friends about this and they said he's starting to like me. When I was walking slowly to 6th period today, Shane quickly walked past me. Then a couple of his friends walked next to me. One of them yelled Holy S*** in my face. Then he said "Sorry" in a joking way. After that, they left to catch up with Shane. Now every time I look at Shane, he's not the one who's looking at me, its his friends. What was that whole yelling thing about?? Why are his friends always glancing at me? It's been bugging me. They never did that before. Does Shane like me?

And then some of the people in my gym class sit at a different table and they are a lot of fun and they are a lot of fun in gym and they know when I tell a joke and they get it.  But I mean like I am not sure with friends I should hang with, because the ones that I am hanging with right now are really nice and they sometimes get it when I tell a joke.  But I am just not sure which group of friends I should hang with!

20090220141846AA1xy8b	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think she likes me?	So there's this girl in my class i've had a crush on for a while, and I think she likes me, but I'm not sure so I thought I could get some advice here.   I sit in front of her in French class, and every class me and her start talking, and we talk so much tot he point that the teacher sometimes changes the seats of one of us. We also tend to hold hands a lot, link arms and she even pretends that I'm her boyfriend, and it's so convincing that some of our teachers and friends thought we really were going out. We're also really close when it comes to the "touch barrier", I mean, I sometimes hold her from her waist against me, I kiss her in the cheek all then time, I hug her a lot also, and she likes to put her head on my shoulder in class. She also likes to give me these little bites, and when I turned 17, which was like 3 days ago she said she would give me a kiss as a present, and that I could pick the place. And I also happen to know that she thinks I'm the 2nd best looking guy in my class, 'cause she said it to a friend of mine. And I don't think she's being a flirt, because I have never seen her do anything even remotely close to the things we do with other guys.   The reason why I'm confused is that she once told in class to some of us that she only dates guys that are like, 18 or 19 years old (she didn't say it out of the blue, she said it because we were talking about stuff like that), and because I also think she is kinda out of my league ( it's not like I'm ugly, I mean I have blonde hair and blue eyes, but she is just absolutely beautiful). So, what do you think, does she like me?      BTW, I'm 17 and she is gonna be 18 in a month.

20090220143253AAaYD9q	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Boss is always targeting me in a abusive way..?	I am not sure if i can put all the things together.. I started working in this new office nearly an year ago. I have nearly 5 yrs experiance and then 3 months later someone with much less experiance suddenly got promoted and was made my boss. she was in the same cadre as that of me before that. I was doing some projects and finished it successfully and I think my boss felt bit insecured and started torturing me . She would ask me for suggestions then would start picking on me and insulting me. I felt over stressed and then had to complaint her boss about her abusive way... It looks like she made up lot of stories around me and her own boss was only trusting her. Then I gave up on everything and tried to ignore her abuse and started just concentrating on my work.. no matter how hard I work and bring all the good things to her team she would keep telling bad reports about me and made sure that my work does not get noticed. My team mates who work for her , most of the time they dont even work but yet she will never hurt them.. She just picks on me for everything.. I tried everything yoga , meditation and keep myself away from what ever she makes and try to be so much co operative with her .. but still she want to fight me.. it is as thought she is beating the dead snake..       I just wonder , will people never give up hurting ? why do people have so much vengeance .. I always hear about lot of back stabbing and lies will be there at the corporate level.. But this seems to exceed the limit.. Is there any hope that this boss would change her attitude towards me ? Is there any hope.. my friends say that it would not get any better... is it true ?

20090203044708AAkR7HF	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do we know if they are doing this to be nice or because we are younger?	On valentines day, we are going to a hotel for the night with my BF cousin and his wife.      We are 22 and 24, the cousin is 37 his wife is 26.      Their daughter was diagnosed, treated and now in remission from leaukaemia from 7m till 15m. Their daughter is 6m older than our daughter so we attend toddler groups and such together. We are all good friends.      However, when we go out, it seems they always want to pay for things and take great offence when we say no, or try to offer money. We do not want or expect them to pay for anything for us.      So we are all going to the hotel for valentines, and i just know they will do the same for the meal, or drinks.      How do we get it through to them that we want them to stop this - as nice a gesture as it is and we appreciate, but we do think its unfair on them.      Sometimes i think its because we are a bit younger, especially than his cousin, so they feel the need to baby us. My BF says its because we helped out when their daughter was ill.      Regardless, of the reason, how do we stop it
20090220151717AAuHjVL	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How do you feel about personalized items?	So I'm thinking of getting a shirt, or a tote bag personalized for my wedding/honeymoon...but I'm not sure if I really like the idea or not lol       I like the ones that just say Bride, but putting something like "Soon to be Mrs.Smith"  or "The New Mrs.Smith" seems a little much.      So, do you think personalized items with your entire new last name are cute or kinda tacky?

20090220145520AAEwP3l	Family & Relationships;Family	Was my dad right to do this?	okay, i was on the computer but this one wouldn't let me ask a question or answer them so i went to the other one acrooss the room and i didn't want to exit out of anything or clear the history (i was on for a while and had the thing scrolled down for like 5 minutes, lol) because he would have gotten mad thinking i was hiding something which i'm not. anyways, i'm looking out of the corner of my eye to see what he is doing and he is looking through my email ! i asked a question like.. are you a quiet listener or loud talker and he was all curious. i had like 500 messages from yahoo answers because i don't clear it that much and he was going through them all. i started crying and tried grabbing the mouse away from him and he held me back. i couldn't get him to stop so i ran upstairs. the reason i didn't want him doing this is because i asked a personal girl question and i don't want him seeing it at all. it's nothing bad just personal girl stuff. he said he has the right to look through my email and myspace. i don't think so. i mean if you do you NEED TO ASK FOR PERMISSION FROM ME first.          what do you guys think??
20090220143950AArK2uQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I think I might be having second thoughts?...?	Ok, so I'm getting married to a wonderful man in October. We have been dating for almost 3 years and I knew almost instantly that I wanted to be with him always. We compliment each other very well.. we're both goofy and fun, but conservative and reserved.. we share the same views and opinions on politics, religion, how we want to raise our children.. I mean for the most part.. everything.. we do have our differences but nothing too extreme.       My problem is, lately I've been feeling like I don't know if I'm making the right decision. I don't know why. I'm starting to feel smothered and trapped. Is that normal?      I kind of feel like I'll be missing so much if we do go through with this..  but I know I'll lost something awesome if we don't. I have no idea why I'm feeling like this... I think that maybe I'm just self sabotaging. Before I met him I was a big self sabotager.. anything good in my life I would run from it.. I used to be terrified of commitment which is why I've changed jobs a million times.. dropped out of college a million times... and now I've had a relationship with this wonderful person all of a sudden, I questioning it.       Is that normal? What can I do to make these feelings stop?  He's starting to notice my distance and he's being very patient with me. He's just so awesome and we're so awesome together and I just don't understand where all of this is coming from.       We are both 24.. will be 25 in a few months and again the wedding is in October. I don't know how well postponing the wedding will go over since right now I'm living at his parents house with him and neither of us wanted to live alone together until we're married and my living there was only supposed to be temporary.. I've been there almost a year.. (and while his parents and I get along.. we tolerate each other.. it's not a very comfortable environment for me).       Is this what people mean by 'cold feet'?      Thanks all and sorry it's so long.
20090203042243AALMpef	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Dumped! please give me some advice?	If you were dumped and you thought the girlfriend or boyfriend who dumped you was your perfect partner, soulmate, best looking person in the world, the only one that you could ever be with, etc...      Did you go on to find another partner afterwards who actually WAS better looking, more fun, more of a soulmate and more the perfect partner than you could ever imagine?      I was with the girl that dumped me 6 years and I really did think she was the one, although she wasn't too bothered about getting engaged, etc...      I'm just wondering if it really is true that someone better will come along!

20090220152650AAQaLyD	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Who did you invite to your wedding just for the pure fun of it?	My husband and his best friend go into Guyland (no, not Gay land) together. The two of them are hilarious. Everything is either "man law" or the response to some off the wall comment is "now THAT'S what I'm talking about!"  They're like Frick and Frack.  Their relationship has this closeness of Alan and Denny from Boston Legal.  The two of them do this Alan and Denny banter thing together.  *rolls eyes*      We sent invitations to James Spader and William Shatner and their wives.  We had a lot of fun joking around about their imaginary attendance while planning the wedding...with this thought in the back of my head "oh God, what am I going to do if they actually showed up?"      We received a nice persoanl note and a picture from William Shatner along with an invitation to join his fan club. ROTFLMAO.  His picture is sitting on a shelf in our liquor cabinet next to our Scotch collection.  James Spader ignored us altogether. Harrummph!      So....with the extra invitations that you have to order, who are you/did you send an invitation to just for your own storytelling enjoyment?

20090220153004AATePWG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do you do with a woman like that?	My neighbor went out boozing it yesterday afternoon. told his wife he would be back in an hour or so.  anyway, he didn't get back till midnight and when he walked into the house, his wife was waiting there rolling pin in hand.       She just looked at him and said, If you want your dinner, its been ready since 6 o'clock and its in the oven.  He went over, opened the oven and found this burnt torchered steak and a few dry potatos.       So he took the steak and potatos, sat down at the kitchen table and started to eat it saying "oh boy that tastes soooo good.  I just love the steak, thankyou Susan".  Well that made her mad and she started hollering at him for being so late coming home.       Now, how the heck can he win this deal over. He was nice and even complimented her on the food. What else did she expect???   I think she was just waiting for him to start complaining about the burnt food then she could start in on him.   What do you think?

20090220151215AAProd2	Family & Relationships;Friends	Advice with Best friend's family?	Hello. My best friend (Aly)'s parents got seperated little less than a year ago. Well her dad (Joe) already has a new girlfriend (Jill) And Jil has 3 kids. Well Jill used to think I was great and all that. But now she hates me. She even told Aly that. She always bosses Aly around like she is her mom. And Joe and Jill have known each other for like 7 months and are engaged. And I'm not allowed over her house because "I will tell what I hear there". Which is stupid. But Jill reads my texts to her daughter. And I asked daughter 1 if their religion allowed to have sex/live together before marriage because they do and I even said Just Wondering... And Jill texted me back: What we do in this house isn't your business. It is between us and God. Not you. Or anyone else for that matter. So worry about your own life, not ours. And you need to worry about correcting yourself, not others. I don't want to discuss this with you.       Now she hates me and I never see Aly... What do I do?! I am SICK of Jill!
20090203042619AAXOL6B	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did She Ever Like Me?	Did She Ever Like Me?   Should I Tell Her I Like Her Or Ask Her Out      She like always say hi when she sees me .(SHE GAVE ME A NICKNAME ITS NOTHING BAD JUST MY NAME SHORTENED AND ALWAYS CALLS ME BY IT)..    In Class last year if the teacher calls my name she would turn around look at me and smile and even now she still doesSometimes she would tell me she loves me but i wasnt sure if shes serious because her friends say it to. We talk mostly on msn and barely at school, but her and her friends always get excited when i show up. We are both 17,& a few months ago without telling me one of my friends ask one of her friends who she likes and her friend said sum guy from another school, then he asked another friend and the friend said she likes no one and is waiting for that special guy, which now makes no sense to me and im confused.       (Earlier this year she told me to write I luv her in my msn nick cause it would be funny:S then the she did the same for hers. ppl started asking us if were dating then she said she when I asked her why she removed her nick she said because she was tired of people asking if we were dating:S, On facebook she left a message on facebook and had bro in it.      We started talking less after prom & for A week in the summer she had a Bf but I didnt really think she liked him that much because her msn name was the same while his was he loved her and less than a week after she broke up with him.This summer we didn't really talk until she left me a message on facebook telling"Wats Up Long Lost Home Dog I miss U with Smily Faces ,      Recently She started saying Hi to me less but in gym I see her looking at me alot, .and recently when she says hi she makes her best friend say it to, also if she sees me talking with sum1 she will wait till Im done and she will say she woulda said hi earlier but didnt want to interpt me,& when I walk bye her class she will call me and wave with her cute smile:).       *I was at my bustop 2day and when she saw me she yelled my name so then I went to go talk 2 her , she then asked me if I get annoyed that she says Hi everytime she sees me and I said no its np.

Dont ask me what i'm doing on YA, just dont know who to ask. I used to have a secretary work for me for 27 years but she retired a month ago.

One thing i notice is she seems to be wearing very sexy clothes into work (we share an office) and shes extremely busty and will often bend down over me and let me see down her shirt. I dont know is this intentional or not but it sure distracts me. Also shes always flickign her long blond hair and smiling and touching me when she talks. Today her skirt is a second skin and her bottoms high and pert and round and those skyscaper heels..and skimpy shirt..get a pic? We all went to a funcion the other night and her and i were talking, she touched my thigh...is this girl interested? I'm married but am open to a little extra ciricular.

20090203042426AA5gzMr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is the best way to fortify a relationship if your gf gets pregnant and wants to keep it or even if not?	specifically, i believe that i have inadvertently gotten my girlfriend pregnant.  we don't know yet for sure but i have the feeling that i did.  i don't know if she'll want to keep it or not.  i would want her to but i'm 27 and she's only 22 and we have only been dating a short time but very deeply.  plus she lives in another country and i think really loves me but is sometimes very unsure if she wants to commit to me because of the distance and other factors like her non-english speaking family who she wants to be near and comfortable with, and a high school boyfriend who she has a deep attachment to although they are broken up and are better that way. (they are officially broken up only very recently and were together on and off for many years before that and he still loves her, and she still has feelings for him, even though she broke up for good, she says, and their relationship consistently failed).  i would be willing to move to her country and devote my life to her and our baby and of course i will tell her this.  does anyone have some advice, perhaps from experience on what the best way to handle this is if a) she wants to keep it, and more importantly b) if she doesn't.  because i would like to maintain our relationship and have it grow stronger and stronger either way.  i would marry her but she wouldn't want to as she is still very unsure about a lot of things.  if she wants to keep it, i am worried about her still not wanting to commit to me, and i wonder how to keep our relationship good and growing in that instance. but mostly i'm worried about her feeling horrible about being pregnant and wanting an abortion so i would want to know how to ease those fears and make her feel as good about it as possible.  i am very scared about how she will react if and when she finds out that she is pregnant.  i really don't want her to be depressed about it and i really don't want her to not be with me anymore because of it.  thanks for any and all help, i really appreciate it.

We haven't had sex yet and we were going to try, (it's my 1st time), so could he have been nervous? It's just that he really isn't usually the nervous type and he's a very sexual kind of guy.    He was a bit hard, but not hard enough...is he not attracted to me?    I normally give him hj and he comes all the time (he did later that night when i gave him one), so what was up with him before when he wasn't hard enough to have sex? thank you

He stayed for about 30 mins and he was really funny and had a similar personality to mine. On his way out he told me to call or text him today but he didn't answer. After he left we talked a little...and he was like so you don't think Im creepy and I told him no and that I thought he was cute and funny. He told me I was tall and cute. So anyways he didn't respond to my text today..... Is he not that into me...or am I being psycho?

She just recently became legal and I said that now that she's of age we should go out sometime and she should give me her number. So we exchange numbers (she says sweet when I give her my number). Normally I'd just give her a call and set up a meeting but I'm pretty sure this girl has a boyfriend. Well, I don't know for certain but since she's really beautiful I see no reason she wouldn't have one. But if she does have one why would she give me her number (while we did know each other before we never really talked or anything, we don't have any of the same friends, we just used to work together a while back). How should I proceed?

Now before I get any answers, I'd like to say that NO I am not trying to change him. I don't want any answers saying, "Just accept him the way he is." I'm not doing anything major. I'm just letting him come out of his little "shy shell" one step at a time.   First, I'm going to try getting him to talk more.      Now, I've already explained to him that I wish he would talk a little more.   But of course, he's still a little too shy.      I feel as if I'm running all the conversations. I know I don't bore him, because he looks at me, laughs, and really listens.   But he never seems to talk himself.      I'm afraid I intimidate him (Because I'm an extremely talkative person,) but he should know that I'm a good listener as well and I would love to hear him talk about HIS day.      Any suggestions to getting him more outgoing and less shy?      Thanks. =]
20090220145611AAwqLvw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get a skater guy to like me?	I think I almost have him liking me [or I might already]   But the only problem is that he has a girlfriend who's literally one of those preppy, dumb 'I'm so cool and popular' people, and they never hang out!    She only asked him out because her crush asked out her bff so she tried to impress him by 'dating' his friend (long story).   But he's so funny when he makes a joke I like cannot stop laughing.   I don't skate so don't suggest that.   I have his email and I really want to email him but usually he's the one talking to me so I don't know how to start the conversation.   thx!!

20090220145245AACS4Hy	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If Your Husband Tells You It Is Not Important To Him?	You been together for over 14 years . You both dearly love one another but then you discover something that has you so devestated that it must be corrected. ) Your husband was never legally divorced to his 1st wife.) He tells you we will get it done but this is just to shut you up and when you finally get the information he procrastinates and tells you it really isn't important to him. He tells you he can lie and tell you things you want to hear but it is not important to him.    What would you make of that?  Besides the B word it doesn't seem to bother him because he thinks nothing will ever come out with it like him being asked for his 1st divorce paper that was final.    He has one paper from 1995 when his ex sent him the papers for divorce. He never contacted her to finish it.    He now has been in contacted with her for the past 2 years and he says he mentioned it once to her but nothing ever happened.  He doesn't want to get back with her  but it truly bothers me from the bottom of my heart that he can tell me straight out It is not important to him.   My husband firmly believes (or he must be stupid) that we got married by a minister and have a marriage license but still in the courts eyes or legally our marriage is voided out. None of this seems to matter to him. He says your my wife and this will not change any of my feelings for you.   I just do not get it.     I found out that it was never done when I was working at a law firm in 2006 and found out this information.    Would you pick up and leave after 14 years which is very hard being your with the person for a very long time.    He is in his comfort zone he likes things the way it is?    He doesn't give me any reasons why it is not important to him.   She never remarried and never was in a serious relationship so she doesn't really care if it is done or not.    We have no kids together he has 2 older children with her in their 20's.    What can some of you tell me this means and how would you take it if your husband would ever tell you this?    Please don't say he can go to jail because no one ever stepped forward about it cause no one knows just him, me and her and my sister.  Again it doesn't seem to bother him in any way about it but said we will get it done because I see how much it bothers you. It gets to me because it would bother any women if this was happening to them. The more I wait for him to tell her the more I get anxious. I can not speak to her because her and her kids resent me.    Any help would be appreciated?

20090220151219AAiMzld	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is my life over? Do I even have a future?	I have no life. I'm stuck in this neighborhood that might as well be a ghetto. I envy the hooligan across the street and his drug addict mother because they at least have a life.      I can't drive because of my anxiety. I have Asperger's Syndrome and OCD which I had to take medication for.   I also have acid reflux now and have to take Zantac twice a day. I am not taking my Zoloft and Risperdal because I do not want to take four medications a day. The only time when it is okay and normal to take four pills a day is when you're old or dying. I'm 20 years old despite living the life of an overprotected 12-year-old and feeling as jaded as a middle aged person. It's pathetic how the average 12-year-old could run circles around me socially.      I have a feeling that I'm going to be alone, unemployed and living with my parents for the rest of their lives. My parents will think that I'm a bigger failure and disappointment than they already do. I can't even keep a minimum wage job as I'm socially dense and my anxiety shakes me up to the point where I can't even concentrate on the simplest things.      I can't transfer to a school in a stimulating city because I have a crappy 2.8 GPA and my parents are too busy paying for the tuition of my sister's prestigious college. I'm not good at anything that will help me make money and have a lucrative career. I fail at math and science. Nothing I'm good at counts for anything.      I can't talk to my school counselor because they are only watchdogs who make sure that everyone that visits them is not the next Cho Seung Hui from Virginia Tech. When I told them about my intrusive, disturbing thoughts last summer, they shipped me off to the mental hospital where I ended up for over six hours. I was too scared to call my parents. I feared that they would either get mad at me or cry. I've never seen my mom cry before and I did not want this to be the first time.      My parents found out and all hell broke lose. After an agonizing search for a professional, we found a psychiatrist because the psychiatrist was the first person to take our insurance AND be able to write a letter to the school saying that I'm fine.      I'm tired of this crap. When is the next time I'm going to get hospitalized? I remember being forced to see a psychiatrist when I got into a fight in high school. What am I going to get diagnosed with next? Even my mother said I have caused problems since day one because I stopped talking at 18-months-old and did not speak again because of autism, how I was forced to go to a special ed.school throughout elementary school.      My mind is garbage and hell. I'm stuck in this bland, stifling town where the only stimulation is the fist fights that happen sometimes and how the thugs are so professional and advanced that they could dodge the cops minutes before they show up and never get arrested for their drugs and mini-riots when they do.   Sometimes I feel I'm too good for this, yet I feel that I deserve this and this is my place in the world. Is there anyway I can escape my situation?

20090220152608AACNQZD	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is cheating always sexual? Or can cheating be something else?	I am in a serious relationship for almost 5 years now. Never cheated before. Never even think about it. But I just meet this guy on Monday he asked me for my number. I usually don't/never give anyone my number but for some reason I gave it to him. We've been chatting since Tuesday. He is a very nice, good looking guy who lives out of state; who is originally from another country just like myself (different countries but similar culture). I may never see him again. But something about him is intriguing me and we chat a lot. Nothing sexual... just nice conversation. I even wish I was single so I could go out with him or something... Can cheating be other than having a sexual relationship with someone else?

20090203044636AA9Spqj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a date this week, but he hasn't contacted me for 3 days? WHAT?!?	Met these guys in early December. Got speaking to one of them, and it carried on during the xmas and new years hols. Then went to a gig and he was there, spoke to him some more. Had an awesome time, and got really quite drunk!   My friend and i stayed round his mates (pre-planned) and he came along too. We ended up sleeping next to each other, nothing 'happened' and it was really nice. He kissed me, but not in a sleazy way.      He sent me a text a day later saying it was nice to see me. Got talking more, we have the same-ish sense of humour and we make eachother laugh.       Last week he asked me out for a drink this week. The last i heard from him was 3 days ago, when he literally asked what i was at and if i was ok, and then was like "have a good w/e, speak soon". He obviously didn't want a convo. I stupidly phoned him late that night, and he didn't answer. I left a stupid voicemail (which im prone to do)       I don't know if meeting up with him is gonna happen. PLUS my mate wants to go and see the band the day before we are meant to go for a 'drink'. So i'll be bumping in to him the night before. I don't want to phone him to tell him im going to the gig (my mate told me to let him know) but i've already contacted him the last 2 times and have had no response!      grrrrr

20090220151105AAueX1P	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Question for mature and reasonable adults to answer only please!?	Okay so I've been dating this girl for a couple of months and things seem to be going really well. Earlier this week her friend warned me not to "smother or bug her" but it came up in a way that leads me to believe the girl ive been dating complained about it. Her friend said go at her pace let her text me first, etc. My fear is that she will lose interest in me if I change my behavior and not communicate with her. I understand I could cool it a little bit, but I dont want to change everything thats been working for me so fast because as far as I knew she liked it when I would text her. If all of a sudden I'm more distant and stop texting her aren't I risking her losing interest? I just dont get it because she would always say she likes my texts and they make her day bettter and make her smile whenever she gets them (said that like a week ago multiple times) and now it seems like its annoying and I havent changed my behavior at all since we started dating.

20090220150754AAIRtWH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	(10 easy points for best answer) how do I deal with my bi-polar gf?	Alright my girlfriend is amazing and shes extremely attractive like wow. But she can be like two different people, and I like both of them for there own reasons but its really hard to keep up with her.      One day she will be the cutest girl in the world, she will invite me over to her house for like a movie night and like a family night with her family. Her sister, her mom, and her mom's boyfriend. And its really cute, and innocent.      The next night she will want be alone she will get really turned on, and give me a hand job right on her couch with people walking around, although our hands our hands and lower bodies are under the blanket.      Basically she can be the cutest and most sexual person. But when she gets mad she can be just a huge ***** to me. For example if I don't say I love you enough, or I don't respond to one of her text's fast enough she will get really mad. When I go to fast in bed, like you know feeling a little tingly jingly to fast, she will get pissed. And will say I'm not taking my pants of for anything for the rest of the night. And like 10 minutes later there she goes again, ripping off my pants.      Whenever the subject of cheating or something comes up, she will like grab onto me. And say you better not **** around got it. And say stuff like don't hurt me or I will kill you, and she has this angry yet sexy face on as she does it.      When shes texting me its worse, I will tell her I'm going to bar, and shes like be a good boy or else. And she literally won't leave me a long the whole night because shes so worried.      Now I am kind of bothered and really turned on at the same time. Not saying I'm ever going to cheat but if I did she might just kill me. I think she would tie me up and torture me and for some reason that kind of turns me on to.      She literally wants to have me forever, whenever she see's a nice house she says that's going to be our house. Lets remember she can really really sweet, and then go really really scary.      Any advice on how to stay on her good side more often then not?
20090220144821AAD9MnI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why are some people so offended by the concept of a Prenuptial Agreement?	I recently asked another question, and some of the answerer's were very offended, to the point of saying if they were asked to sign one they would not marry them (if the asker wasn't a celebrity or millionaire).  Others offended to a lessor degree saying prenups are just a bad idea.       Why is it so offensive to say "we'll both leave with what we came in with" and divide up the things we bought together should something terrible ever happen?      Now, I'll assure you I am far from from being "rich" or a celebrity, but what does that have to do with anything?  The things I do have I feel lucky to have, and have WORKED HARD for!!        Ok, so maybe a prenup is a bad thing, I don't feel the best about doing it.  But I'm not living in fantasy land either, getting a prenup made up may be the most important financial thing I ever do in my life (more important than what grades I got, what school, what major, what promotion, what salary, etc).  We aren't married and as I've said, I am committed already to them for life and that means the person they are now and the person they become as life deals the deck.      If we all admit that when you marry a person you CAN'T possibly know how that person will change over the years, then why is it so offensive to some people to say out front heres how we would deal with things IF the worst were to happen?  Asking what IF isn't saying this is gonna happen, or that you want it to happen.  Hopefully it never does, and if thats the case you stay married forever, then the prenup meant nothing.        A lot of people do divorce though (between 1/3 and 1/2 depending on statistics), and saying "oh that cant happen to me" isn't realistic.  We cannot control our partners actions, and therefore we cannot control the relationship.  We can only control ourselves.      I know in my relationship, we've had times where my sig other was ready to walk out and almost did.  I didn't forget that.  I've forgiven, but won't forget.  All you have to do is read the yahoo answers marriage board and you get a pretty good feeling that married people are not perfect just like the rest of us.  If anything, life only becomes more stifling and harder for most once marriage is a reality.  I don't personally see it that way (that I'm somehow held back by being in an eternal relationship), but many do apparently.        WHY DO SOME PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY ARE ENTITLED TO BEING SUPPORTED FOR LIFE by an ex?  I don't get it, would the tables be turned I'm sure they would see the unfairness.  If two people separate why on earth would one person be legally obligated to continue to support the other afterward?  It's not like these are ancient times - anyone can get a degree, adults later in life, men, women - and anyone can learn to support themself (IF THEY WANT).      To me the issue is that some people have more drive than others, and if you happen to be on the receiving end of being married to someone with significantly higher assets and lifestyle then it makes sense to me that you should enjoy that while together but be alright with going back to how you were before being married should you get divorced.        If your partner won't sign a prenup, it seems like that would be the very kind of person who is looking to manipulate your hard work ethic and drive, only to leave you high & dry in the long run.  By not signing they are basically admitting that is their intention and you've called their bluff.        ]I realize getting a prenup made up isn't at all romantic or even fun (to think about "what if my life is ruined') but it seems that two mature adults able to plan about their future and that of growing children should also be able to plan for themselves with an attitude of "neither one of us wants this to happen, but if it does - heres how we deal with it".        Does anyone who is offended by the thought of a prenup think it will be any easier to suss out those details once one of you has filed for a divorce?  Will you cut each other more slack then or at the outset?

20090220150532AAzWCfK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I overreacting when I end a friendship with an ex-girlfriend?	Quite a long time ago, this particular lady and I split.  I have since moved well on, I have a fiance and am excited about my new life with her.      When I split with this other lady, her and I said that we would remain friends.  Her and I would maintain only occasional contact via email or phone, maybe once a month if that.      Recently, I went online through MSN to say hello.  All she did was shake the screen and say nothing back.  Obviously, I terminated the connection.      Next, a couple of days later, I sent her a very polite email, just wondering how things were, sharing some about myself, all-in-all a very polite inquiry.  Now I know what you might be thinking!  I have never desired to get back with he, honest.  It was just friends.      Anyways, a couple of weeks go by with no answer to  my email.  I'm sure that she received it.  I finally decided to send her one last email, ending the friendship.      It was polite.  In it I mentioned about the msn deal and the email that I had sent.  I stated that she obviously had made her intentions clear that she no longer wanted to be friends.  I told her that I didn't appreciate being treated that way and that it would be best to end the friendship.  None of my other friends would ever treat me this way.  I wished her well and that was it.      She responds and agrees that it would be best to end things that way...and then proceeds to tell me that I overreacted.  I remember how she used to get at times, accusing me of overreacting, especially when I tried to talk to her about any issue that she didn't want to deal with.      I do not think that I overreacted at all.  I feel that I was quite right to feel the way that I did.  I recently sent her a very brief email.  In it (very politely mind you), I told her that I did not feel that I had overreacted at all.  I agreed with her response from last time, ending the friendship, and wished her well.      What are your thoughts on all of this?
20090203045045AAigtqU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he really likes me? All answers are appreciated??	He's a shy guy when it comes to love and he's single    i told him about my feelings but he told me we're just friends, I've heard that he just broke up did I say it too soon?    -He slipped his hand on my arm    -When we had a vacation, I told him that i'll miss him, he whispered me too    -He smiles whenever he sees me    -He looked at me , it was showing that his eyes were smiling    -One my friend went and gave him something, he didn't do anything   but when she told him that's its from me, he smiled an ear to ear smile    -It was like a party, i was looking at him and when he looks at me I look down and vice versa[ when i catch him looking at me he looks down]    -When he caught me staring at him, he smiled an ear to ear smile    -He asked me if I was in the mall with a group of my friends[ we got seperated afterwards in the mall] I told him ya, he told me I felt that you were there.  I asked him if he's coming today to the mall he told me he doesn't think he can make it, i told him you have to come[ in a joking way] he smiled then he told me i'll see.    he also raised and lowered his eyebrow toward me although i didn't know what he meant    i was in the car and he was on the sidewalk, i lowered the window and smiled and he smiled back and when the car pulled off, he looked back at it. i always smile at him and he smiles back.  The next day he talked to me about it, he told me I saw you in the car      Also, I was with my friend in the school hallway, i was waiting for him and when I saw him coming i looked down but i saw that he was waiting for me and smiling    i really love him but i dont know what to do    thanks?

He had a good excuse and he acknowledged my birthday with the usual dinner out, but I can't shake the feeling of disappointment. I have given him several birthday parties. It's not like he's not the planning type, and we have friends who would have helped him. My 31st is in 2 weeks and I am depressed about the possibility of feeling forgotten again.    Would you feel the same?

Im still a virgin so i didnt know about being shaved and we recently saw each other naked , but we did go all the way that time.

20090220145225AAYlhRM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Are things moving to quickly?	Okay, so I have been with my boyfriend for three months.  We are both 19 and think we are each others soul mates.  I have never felt this way about a guy before and trust him completely with my heart. I also have never been able to be myself as much as I am with him.  He is away at school in Arkansas and we want to spend the rest of our lives together. Do you think getting engaged over the summer, we will both be 20 and then we will be together for 8 months, and then waiting 2 years is a good plan? I love him and don't ever want to lose him but I am just wondering what other people my age think. I honestly never thought I would find someone like him, and we both have the same ideas for our life. We want to be done having kids by the time we're 30 so getting married young makes sense to me. What do you think?
20090220150214AAYS9Mj	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do you ever cry when someone else gets a spanking?	I was sleeping over my friends house and her little sister (she's 10) wouldn't go to bed, so her mom came in and gave her a spanking. I hated to see it and it made me kinda cry seeing her mom spank her. Actually, whenever her mom tells my friend or her sister shes gonna spank them it makes me want to cry. Is that normal. Would you/did you ever cry if someone else got spanked or do you feel uncomfortable like me when the word "spanking" is said by someone's mom?
20090220144658AALLgQ7	Family & Relationships;Family	Please help me, I'm so tired of dealing with this?	My Mother's acting like a total cow. I'm 14 years old and she's 33. I'm so sick of her bullsh*t, she gives out constantly that I disrespect her and a few minutes ago she confiscated my phone and threatened to send me away, for reasons I'll explain in a minute.      She's just come back from a three-day trip to Paris, and since she got back she's been biting the head off me. [She didn't bring me with her because it's in the middle of the school year, that's fair enough, she said she'd bring me in the summer after my exams] She was out for dinner tonight and she came back, I was sitting on the sofa watching TV, and she started snapping at me, telling me to get up and let her sit down.      I don't know why I got angry, but I did. I can't remember exactly what I said, but I rolled my eyes and made a sarcastic comment like, "Yeah, you must really need to relax after your stressful holiday", and then I got up and left and went down to my room. I slammed my door after me.      She followed me down and grabbed my phone off my bed and started roaring at me, saying, "I work damn hard, I won't be spoken to like that, I raise you on my own and I don't have to take your cheek, I'm this close to making a call to get someone to look after you". I don't know what that meant but I think she means my father, I have serious problems with him that I don't want to get into here, I couldn't believe she'd even bring him up.       Then she took my phone with her and left. I'm not really annoyed that she went on holiday without me, but I hate the way that she can go off and be so relaxed and as long as she's having a good time everything's okay, but as soon as she comes back and she's not having a good time any more, if I do the slightest thing wrong, she goes nuts. She's such a narcissist. She thinks that just because she's a single parent, it means that everyone has to worship her.      I don't mean this in a bad way, but it's not like I asked to be born. I don't make it hard on her. I don't drink or smoke or do drugs, I get really good grades. I'm not a troublesome kid, and that's the honest truth.      I have enough on my plate without her being such a b*tch for no apparent reason. Can someone please help me to deal with her?

20090220150135AALrUUt	Family & Relationships;Family	How do you stop hating your mother?	My mother and I used to be close... kind of. I'm 20 years old, married, and expecting my first child. And for some reason, all the resentment and hatred I've ever had for my mother has hit me full force. I was homeschooled my whole life. But my mom didn't know what she was doing, nor did she care. Her reason for homeschooling me was "kids will pick on you. They'll make fun of your ears, and your legs, and your hair. You're too much of a baby to handle it" she would tell me things like that whenever I begged to be put in school. How do you think that made a little girl feel? I always wondered what was wrong with me, was I really that ugly? I still have self confidence issues because of that. We lived out in the country, and I had no social life growing up. No friends. Only my little brother, who was also homeschooled. (Except my mom thought it was a good idea to put me, a 12 year old, in charge of his education, as well as my own.) We went to church, so I had a little interaction with humans that way. I got engaged to a complete loser when I was 17. My reason for doing so was simply to get away from my mom. I ended up breaking it off with him a few months before the wedding. Growing up my mother would do all sorts of evil to me. At least thats how I saw it...   When I was 12 I wanted to stop wearing ankle length dresses and start wearing blue jeans, like every other girl. My mother made me shop in the boys section of the clothing store for my pants. People from my church would give me bags of clothes, including girls jeans. When I'd wear them my mother would tell me I looked like a whore. Slut. Skank. Whatever word came to mind. Even if they were baggy, or 4 sizes too big and held on with a belt! I would argue back, and that would result in me having a bloody lip, missing hair, ect. She mostly went for punches to the stomach, or throwing me around by my hair. She wasn't a drunk, or druggie, in fact she was a sunday school teacher at our church. But at home she was a completely different person. My dad was always the in-between. Litterally. Mom behaved herself when he was home, and if she started getting abusive, my father would actually physically step between us and pull her off me. She would go into fits over anything and everything, I never hit her back, but eventually I got sharp enough with my mouth to fire back some verbal shots. Eventually, I got to the point wher I'd stand there, and take her hits. Not blink, not cry, not show any emotion. I would absorb everything, both verbal and physical, and hold it inside. Its no surprise that I lost my virginity and a year of my life to a man who was 7 years older than me (illegal since I was only 17) and abusive. He had all the same qualities as my mother. The man I'm now married to is wonderful, he's sweet, kind, supportive, and he knows about all my mental issues concerning my mother and my childhood. My mother has 'turned over a new leaf' I guess you could say, and is now trying to be my best friend. She wants to be around my son when he is born, she wants to talk to me every day, and calls me constantly. I wish with all my heart that I could make myself love her, but even the thought of her around my son makes my blood boil. My dad and I are close, and I love him to death, but in my mind, my mother is still the witch I grew up with. How do I get over all the things she did to me, especially the things that still have effects on my life? I don't have a highschool diploma or a GED, thanks to her, all the things I wanted to do with my life I can't now, because of her. I have no self confidence, no trust in anyone, and I am incapable of making friends, because I never had any growing up. As a result I'm 20 years old, pregnant, my only friend is my husband, and I'm terrified of having this baby because I have no female support, and don't want my mother involved. Somebody help me!!!!!!

But I feel that I'm wrong here.        My friend went away to the air force nearly half a year ago and since then me and his girlfriend have hung out a few times.

I go to school, I do good, and I want to have fun with friends since there is absolutely nothing else to do.      So we got in a fight and she said that I shouldn't be drinking every weekend.       I think it should be ok since there is nothing else to do in this stupid lame town and I work my *** off in school.

But this morning my dad was yelling at me because I accidentally spilled a drink. I tend to get yelled at alot and I cry easily. I was trying so hard not to cry while he was yelling at me, but I did a little. And then he started yelling at me about controling my emotions. How can I do that? I try so hard to. I always tell myself that I wil be able to do it, but when the moment comes I just break down and cry. And I know people must get so irritated with me for it.

20090220151104AA5mFfq	Family & Relationships;Friends	In need of opinion about these two guys?	I need help trying to figure out which one of these guys like me:   Guy #1-Ask about me through other people, for example, my immediate co-worker,through another manager-he asks"So how is so and so doing", everytime he talks to my co-worker George, and everyone else.He's also called up to my job three times asking for my whereabouts and claiming that he wanted to meet me, but never showed. Told me to call him anytime.Every time I see him,he always looks in my eyes, just stares of in space at me,but never speaks.There were two occassions were I was in the office, he did not want to come into the office while I was there.   Guy#2   Mostly talks to him over the phone,very friendly,he told me one time,"Girl don't look at me like that".Jokes and laughs with me alot.Used to call me for little things, like schdueling and payroll.Refused to interact with me, there was numerous occasions were upper management would ask him to drop off stuff to me,or meet with me to explain something,and he would either make up an excuse,or drop whatever paperwork with another co-worker.Another thing is the few times I call him for overtime,he gives very short answers..and he hangs up.The other day, he called up to my job, to say hi to my co-worker George,.and the thing is George has only met this guy twice, so they don't know each other at all really(so I thought that was weird)and when I got on the phone with him,.he didn;t really say much, he said he just called to see how we were doing.   Sidenote"These two guys are very good friends..:)

20090220152249AA7Fxe2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is my husband telling the OW we are divorced, when we aren't?	We havent seen each other in almost 2 years and haven't spoken in over a year.      Although he filed for a divorce last year, he never finished or followed it up and made the necessary changes to his complaint to go through with it. So the judge dismissed it.      So why is he telling her we are divorced.....and why isn't he doing anything about it now if he wants one.      We also have two young children and they are with me.  Child support was filed and I should be getting it anyday now.      Why didn't he finish his divorce and why would he tell this OW (who knew about me) that we are when we really aren't.      The OW keeps saying (found out from blog) that he is really divorced because my husband showed her the divorce decree, but it was a decree stating the judge dismissed the case, not granted the divorce.      I am planning to visit in the summer so I can take my kids to see his grandmother...should I let him know we're there...but I think his mom may tell him anyway.....

He got fired last month without any warning. He was totally shocked. Part of the reason is politics issue at work. Even he has a excellent performance, but his boss doesn’t like him so fired him at this time. My husband couldn’t believe it because he never thinks he would be the one who would lose the job. Now we need to face the truth. I am very deeply sad and worry. Don’t know what he can find a job soon, especially when the economics is so bad. He’s been a management team for a long time. Now it’s a tough time for him to find the proper job for himself. I saw his struggle, I am sad to see that. I am sad too. I know a lot of people might have the similar situation. All I need to know is how I can become happier and help my husband to find a job soon.

Did they hear him plead with her to spend time with him just as I did the "single" man that I was seeing?  Did they know that's how we ended up together----telling each other how much we wanted to spend time with the people we loved but they refused? Do they know it takes more than a signed piece of paper to make a marriage? I think there is a lot they don't know. I asked a question and I do appreciate the real answers I got. I will leave my judgment where it belongs...with God.

20090203043955AAR9qnR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My ex is coming to see me tomorrow, what do I do?	My boyfriend of 2 years and I were very much in love. He was very deeply in love with me,  and constantly talked about his feelings for me to his friends. He expressed a desire to marry me and we had many plans for the future. I just spent 4 months away from him in Thailand, and while it was difficult because we missed each other, we didn't have any fights. When I came back from Thailand, we began having problems. Christmas with his family was terrible, and I found myself being very depressed and crying.       We were having problems and fighting all through the month of January.  I thought things were on an upturn however. But the day before my birthday when he was supposed to visit and bring me some of my things from his house (I'm in university and stay in a dorm) he never showed. Instead I got an email saying it was over, and to never contact him again. It was completely out of the blue, 3 days prior, he had been expressing his love.       I went to his house to confront him, and it was messy and sad, but I finally left after an hour or so. On Sunday, we talked again, and he said he was very sad about the whole issue, and part of him wanted to take me back, but he was scared of getting hurt. He also said he would still like to see me sometime, but maybe as friends.       I would really like to work things out, but I'm afraid of pushing things. He's told me about this pattern before. He had a lot of crazy exes and one day without warning he just cuts them out of his life. I'm quite upset it's happened to me, but we also had a better, stable, and more loving relationship than any he had previously, so I'm inclined to believe I'm the person he can break this pattern with. It's hard to see 2 years of love go down the drain after only a month of trouble.      So what do I do when he comes? Ask to be taken back? Or will that be pushing him further away? Do I just smile and say thanks for the memories, my door is always open? I really don't want to be desperate or drive him away, but I'm also having a hard time controlling my grief over this loss.  Any advice is helpful

At the start of our relationship, after about a month, me and my boyfriend were having sex A LOT, however, although at the time it was great, I think there was a bit too much of soemthing good which has now after a year taken the initial spark that was there in the first few months of our relationship. Don't get me wrong, we still have sex a couple of times a week, and it's good, but he doesn't seem as interested to do it as he used to be, it's harder to arouse him, and we do it a lot less than we used to. I understand that he's settling, and that's fine. I just don't want it to get to a stage where it's a rare thing or we can't be bothered. How to I keep that spark that comes at the start of a relationship after we both get settled?

20090203045801AAD70x9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I Think I'm Falling For A Woman 15 Years Older Than Me - What Do You Make Of This?	I am a young man of under 20, and think I am falling for a single mum some fifteen years older than me - I teach her son piano on a one-to-one basis - am I silly to be harboring some kind of want for her? Despite my youth, the small amount of time I spend with her son is always enjoyable, I enjoy his take on life. His dad sadly is not around anymore and I know she bought him for lessons as she needs a father figure to fill this tragic void in his life - he loves coming for lessons, and I know she appreciates the extra effort I put it for him, she was keen when I suggested I would take him out to see a proper motorbike race meeting. I know I may seem very young, but it's as if i adopt a different set of values from most people my age. I find girls of my age largely immature - I would love the opportunity to be part of their world. I find her sexually very attractive, but more than that - her way about life. If she was looking for a partner, what qualities is she looking for, could I ever fit the criteria?

Is this a normal conduct or just no trust and being possessive or should i be understanding?

Kids have things they do- Color and then don't put crayons away, play and then refusing to pick up their toys, change clothes but don't put dirty clothes in hamper (apparently, the floor is better).      So here's the million-dollar question-   What advice do you have for this wife/mother to help her family (mostly Dad) recognize that there are things they can and should do to help her out? Ideal suggestions would be easy to implement and won't piss anyone off too badly, don't want to destroy the marriage, just open his eyes a little.

20090203055438AAMKRC7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband and I were away on vacation and he got drunk?	Then he said all these sweet and beautiful things to me. He told me how beautiful and sexy I am, how much he loves me, how he could never stand to lose me, etc. He doesn't compliment me very much normally. I felt so good!      Then the next afternoon he said we should go to the bar and he could get drunk and say beautiful things again. It really hurt my feelings. I said "Why can't you tell me that you love me when you're sober? Why do you need to get drunk?"      I'm an attractive woman and I have a really nice body, so it isn't that I'm ugly and he has to get drunk to look at me. I get hit on enough to know I'm not a dog's breakfast! My husband is a very jealous man and he notices that I get noticed. One of the things he said to me when he was drunk was that he could never stand to see me with another guy. He said he'd have to kill him - or me - or both. I have always been loyal so there is no reason for him to think like that.       I just want to know if anybody can explain to me why a man would act like this - all sweet when he's drunk and then all critical and judgmental when he's sober. He's like Jekyll & Hyde. Which face is the real one?
20090203054806AAhRtHC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I bring myself up and prevent him from bringing me down?	I've been down for a long time but lately it's been getting worse. I try to make myself feel good but somehow it doesn't really work. I've had problems in my marriage pretty much since the beginning. We aren't a good fit personality-wise. My husband is judgmental and critical - always sees the negative. I am an idealist. He really brings me down.      Lately I've been noticing how he does it. Whenever I have something to feel good about, he points out the bad. This goes for everything from getting excited about a career opportunity to feeling happy that my new face cream seems to be working. It isn't that he is outright nasty just that it is constantly negative.      I don't want to hear Oh just leave! I want to hear from other women who know how to protect themselves from people who erode their self-esteem. My husband won't change, I know that. I love him and there are a lot of good things in our life together. At least that's what I tell myself...and how I lasted this long.      How do I bring myself up and keep him from bringing me down?

20090220155850AA8VDuI	Family & Relationships;Family	I feel my mother depends on me too much?	My mom hasn't been out of the house for 5 months except to go to Doctors due to being sick. She may be feeling a little bit better since she wanted to drive to get a haircut. She told me at 9:00 the evening before she wanted to go. I wasn't expecting her to be driving and I told her there wasn't much gas in the car. She never learned how to pump gas on her own. She decided not to go since I didn't get her gas. When I decide to not live with her she would have to get her own gas. Why do you think my mom never learned to pump gas. I feel she decided I am there to get the gas for her when she needs it. Shouldn't my mom learn to pump her own gas and not depend on me to get it?

20090203050705AAqZkC8	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Do you give wedding programs to every guest or every couple?	We just got our estimate for wedding invitations and programs- $620. We really did not want to spend more than $450 for these. My question is- do you have to give programs to every guest? Or can you give them just to every couple? Or is that tacky? I'm sure it would save me money to only have to get 20 programs instead of 40, but I don't want to look tacky or cheap.
20090220160820AASyAso	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I think to this? - 10 Points Best Answer?	Hey all.      So there's this girl I've known since I was around 11, and I'm 18 now, and when I left high school at around the age of 16, I didn't speak to her again until a few month ago (We were together a lot at high school with other friends and we clearly liked each other but none of us made a move on it) She recently told me she had a huge crush on me, loves my personality and thinks I'm hot..and gave me her number. I like her as well, and I asked her on a date a while ago, but the date wasn't discussed after the night she had to go offline, we were planning it on MSN, lol..she doesn't text me either, she has my number aswell, and she doesn't say Hi or anything when I go on MSN (Not on MSN much anyway) so..I'm guessing she isn't interested..what do you guys think?      (I'd have to talk to her and say fancy going out on *insert date here* somewhere for her to actually come I think..I think she's just bored and not interested, only wants to have fun and will do anything lol....I should add, I saw her on the bus a few times before she told me that on MSN and I was a bit shy to talk much, I'm quite shy until I get to know someone, and I hadn't seen her for a long time so...yeah)         Also - can someone tell me how to delete OLD questions? Can't figure it out!      Thanks!
20090203052012AAhBs1k	Family & Relationships;Friends	I did a bad thing. What do I do?	I made up this "friend" I only told one of my friends about her though. I wanted it to stop so I told her this "friend" moved away. But I made up a yahoo messenger name, and one day I was bored so I got on it and talked to my real friend as this made up friend. When I was talking to her, I made up a secret. The secret was that I was pregnant. (not me, the made up friend.) So, now my real friend will want to keep talking to this made up friend. (maybe.) So, what do I do? I even got pictures of this made up friend. I want it to stop! How do I do it?

20090203052853AAg7Vyu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can some one please give me some advise on this situation?	for some reason i have a big issue with my husband talking to his ex... the one he left for me.... i dont nag about it.. i dont fight about it... i exploded when i first found out but he hid it from me and then tried to lie... but after all was said and done i explained to him that bygones can be bygones.. as long as he doesnt hide things from me and if its nothin to worry about it then ok.... if she is cool i am cool.. ok..   well.. heres the deal... she is very disrespectful to me. and has a big problem with the fact that i dont like her around... as far as i know he only talks to her on the phone.. but.. i could be mistaken....   now.. i trust him.. i really do. but my problem is that fact that he insists on talking to her even after she degrades me and disrespect me. i explained to him how this does not make me feel good AT ALL. he claimed to understand and told me he would not talk to her any more. well she still calls and he still answers the phone( he tries to hide it from me...he told me erased her number so he is unable to call her.. but its alays on the call log in his phone.. or texts from her.. thats a perfect way to keep it with out being in his contacts.) and i found out today that he called her from the house phone! i really think she does not need our home number.. we have a family to worry about i personally feel she should have nothin to do with it. period. i have already blocked her from being able to call our house but it kinda defeats the purpose when he can just call her...   i KNOW i sound like a jealous hormonal pregnant wife.. but come on..   this is really messin with my dignity here... cuz it seems that no matter what i may say to her to deter her from being in his life.. ( she tells me i can do whatever i want i am not gettin rid of her.. but yet also that she does not want him and is happy with her new man... ) he turns around and lets her in any ways...   kinda makes me look like a damn fool if u ask me...   any advise???      they were NOT married! they have no kids together. he had already moved out of the apartment they werer staying in.. which she has done as well since it was HIS apartment. he just chose to leave it to her and she left it as well. .... BEFORE we met up again..and they were on bad terms for a few months after that... me and him have a history that goes back ten years BEFORE we got married.. we have two kids... and one on the way now

20081028000732AAzzkFw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why are women easy to forgive when other women cheat?	I just read an answer to a question a woman posted concerning her failing marriage.  The married women had an affair, while technically still married and she felt awful about it.  In the answer this woman wrote that she was human and I felt the message she sent was that it was OK to cheat even though still married (it was a mistake and she was human).  Why can't cheating married men get the same response from women and not just be categorized as scum of the earth.       It looks like there is a double standard with women.

20070404070443AA3bg7g	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is Love a type of pattern?	I truly feel that in order to keep a healthy realationship with someone that you love- it is a MUST to not show all of your feelings because alot of the relationship (I feel) is knowing that they dont need you. Once you realize that someone needs your love then it usally falls straight downhill UNLESS somehow they feel the EXACT same as you do.. so is that Love? Two people just feeling the exact same?      No one likes the feeling of being "Tied Down" in a relationship that they feel they couldn't get out of - even if they wanted to.      I hate love

I guess I was a little more affectionate in public then he wanted me to be and said now everyone will know about us.      But he said that I was about to become a problem & he said he can already see it, he said he may have to ease up off me because I was starting to act mad.  I guess I'm irritated by his vagueness with me & his failure to show up on time but he told me to maybe stop drinking and I told him from now on I'll keep my distance.      Is there anyway that I can prevent myself from becoming a problem with him.  We enjoy each other but he won't tell me what kind of work he does & although he says I was all over him he was the one who had his hand in my pocket squeezing my butt.      I don't want him to ease up off me, so how do I prevent it?

20090220155639AAfXVwO	Family & Relationships;Family	Help with a problem with my mom?	My friend asked me to spend the night at her house tonight. I told her I would love to.   My mom then asked me if I wanted to go out with her tonight shopping and to dinner. My dad is out of town so it is just me and her at the house. I told her I was already planning on hanging out with my friend. She told me she was "disappointed" in me and said that she doesn't want to be home alone tonight.   The problem is, I really want to spend time with my friend. I see my mom every single night, so I don't understand why she is getting so worked up about it.   Any advice?

20070606213426AAC6xns	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Frazzled and confuzzled????	I met a guy at a party 2 monthes ago, we didn't talk ever again until he asked me to prom then to be his g/f.  I said no to both and he avoided me until the after prom party when we became civil again. He wrote this in his blog: "the after party was okay too, the girl i keep trying to avoid turned out being there, I think I know why i try to avoid her, I liked hanging around her way too much"      A part of me likes him, a part of me hates him, and I think he is desperate but I just don't know what to do about him????

20090203051319AAlTStH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this sound romantic?	Me and my boyfriend Alex split up on the 19th November. And have been seeing each other ever since. Like still being like we were before but without the commitment. Its how we like it.    And my friends keep telling me that I should get over him and stuff because we are not going anywhere. Like moving foward we are like at a stand still..    So it's been snowing here. And he was soooo romantic. Does this sound romantic to you?   Me and alex were standing outside my place and I gave up filming the snow because I couldnt see it through my camera it was to dark. and the next thing I know he tells me to close my eyes and hold his hand. And takes me down under the lamp post where its light and the snow was falling heavily. and kissed me!  We then strolled around the block in the snow chatting and kissing.. and then we got back outside my house and strated chatting about me and him. And we said its better if we are just seeing each other because then we dont argue as much and we cant really loose each other or hurt each other majorly. We were stood in the snow falling down.. and we started slow dancing in the snow. Kissing and all. Then we went inside and cuddled under the covers together in my bed just looking into each others eyes!!      Aand my friends say he is using me.. I don't hink he is. because he said to me this:   Hollie, I never want to loose you I just couldnt survive. Hurting you before was one of the hardest things I ever did. Im sorry. I love you      Your opinions!

But when I see him in school I plan out all this stuff I want to say to him, but when I get to it just all leaks out of my brain and I have nothing to say. I just laugh and smile. I guess I might just be nervous but this has never happened to me with guys before usually I am very outgoing

20090203053110AAGVNPl	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Smart way to deal with this split-up?	We finally declared it was "over" and yesterday I took the liberty of putting in our 60 days notice with our apartments. I'm sure this caught him by surprise a little, but fair is fair. My ( I guess now ex) bf still refuses to move out.  I think on some level, he really believes we are going to work through this.  I am just not there anymore and I can't be there for someone who is not morally, monetarily, or physically helping me with the responsibilities of a family.    So now the only conversations you can hear going on in my house are the ones with my 7 month old daughter.  Really sad, I know and otherwise it's so quiet you could hear a pin drop.  I'm not sure what his motive is for giving me the silent treatment other that the fact that he knows I cannot stand living with someone who doesn't say anything.  I also don't understand why he insists at some point during the night of always getting in my bed.  He can sleep on the couch if we are not together because it makes me uncomfortable to sleep near him now.  He still doesn't help me with the baby too much and he actually hung up one load of laundry.  It's like on one hand he's "trying" if you can call it that, and on the other hand he's got some kind of trick up his sleeve I don't know about.    Since I can't force him to move out, or force him to leave at gunpoint (unfortunately) I'm trying to make the best of it.  I guess it gives me the opportunity to catalog all his "faults" or behaviors that can be used against him in court.  It's probably going to be a pretty bad battle for my daughter from what I can tell.  Other than that, it's pretty painful going through this.  I have just ended a long relationship with my child's father, whom at one point was the love of my life.  I'm not sure when he turned into the monster I believe him to be today, but it wasn't overnight and more like a slow progression.  Is there any advice on how to "tough it out" until the lease is up.  He has a place to go because his mom lives 10 minutes away.  My parents live 2 and a half hours.  I pay all the rent anyway, so I don't see why he insists on doing this...it's hurting me even worse to face him everyday.

20081113142256AABMogP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is there anything wrong with wanting to have sex with a women and that's all ?	I go to work and every day there is this really hot employee. I think she makes less then me, but anyway that's not my point. Is there anything wrong with just wanting to have sex with her. And how would you approach that situation if the answer is yes. Would you really just say, hay you want to have sex, Doesn't that sound stupid? Plus its not like shes a hucker, so I don't want to go about this the wrong way. (plus cant that result in Sexual harassment?)    Would you try and create a relationship just to have sex and then brake it off? (I find that very deceptive and unethical).      I only had a few relationships through my time and my last gf we decided it was best we didnt have sex because we knew that relationship was going to end soon (yep it ended soon).      Like I get relationship sex, but how do you go about just sex, and not in a one night stand style meaning going to a party and picking someone up.       FYI I feel weird putting this into the  singles & dating section. It aint much of a dating question

20090220160105AAVTpL1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question for mature and reasonable adults only to answer?	Okay so I've been dating this girl for a couple of months and things seem to be going really well. Earlier this week her friend warned me not to "smother or bug her" but it came up in a way that leads me to believe the girl ive been dating complained about it. Her friend said go at her pace let her text me first, etc. My fear is that she will lose interest in me if I change my behavior and not communicate with her. I understand I could cool it a little bit, but I dont want to change everything thats been working for me so fast because as far as I knew she liked it when I would text her. If all of a sudden I'm more distant and stop texting her aren't I risking her losing interest? I just dont get it because she would always say she likes my texts and they make her day bettter and make her smile whenever she gets them (said that like a week ago multiple times) and now it seems like its annoying and I havent changed my behavior at all since we started dating.

20090220154850AAxyPoZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	In your opinion:Which guy is showing they like me?	I need help trying to figure out which one of these guys like me:   Guy #1-Ask about me through other people, for example, my immediate co-worker,through another manager-he asks"So how is so and so doing", everytime he talks to my co-worker George, and everyone else.He's also called up to my job three times asking for my whereabouts and claiming that he wanted to meet me, but never showed. Told me to call him anytime.Every time I see him,he always looks in my eyes, just stares of in space at me,but never speaks.There were two occassions were I was in the office, he did not want to come into the office while I was there.   Guy#2   Mostly talks to him over the phone,very friendly,he told me one time,"Girl don't look at me like that".Jokes and laughs with me alot.Used to call me for little things, like schdueling and payroll.Refused to interact with me, there was numerous occasions were upper management would ask him to drop off stuff to me,or meet with me to explain something,and he would either make up an excuse,or drop whatever paperwork with another co-worker.Another thing is the few times I call him for overtime,he gives very short answers..and he hangs up.The other day, he called up to my job, to say hi to my co-worker George,.and the thing is George has only met this guy twice, so they don't know each other at all really(so I thought that was weird)and when I got on the phone with him,.he didn;t really say much, he said he just called to see how we were doing.   Sidenote"These two guys are very good friends..:)

I found out during Christmas that my husband of almost 5 years had been having an affair with a 21 year old woman that I was supossed to be mentoring at church (my husband is 35).  They both claim it was not physical and I came back home to work it out.  Recently while seaching for something in his email I noticed an email from a young lady angry with my husband because she had not heard from him in a year and all the girls at the office wanted to know if they were still    'seeing each other".

I'm trying to play it cool, but I want to curl up in a ball.  I can't see me keeping up this act until I can find someplace to be, but I'm done talking to my husband about this because all he'll do is lie.

We've been together for over 3 years... he's only 23 - supposed to be at his sexual peak. But he's hardly ever interested in sex. He says he's never been that into it. But, we slept together a lot during the first year. Now he can never be bothered. I've tried everything. I tried to be spontaneous last night and his response was an actual groan!!

20090203054325AAN2TMJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy trouble, Please help!?	My BF and I have been together for more than a year and since I had been with him I have had fewer friends and all the male friends I use to have, I had to desert because of his insecurities. He wanted to make sure I was totally loyal to him. He forced me to have sex with him. He too my virginity and put me @ risk of getting pregnant because he takes off the condom during intercourse. Anyway I used back up contraceptives but that caused me to gain weight thus I refused to give him sex yet he forces me anyway and always had his way because of his physical strength over mine. If not he preys on my emotions and says things just to make me feel sorry for him and go and see him (I’m sick, Head hurts, got injured etc). its now at the point where I have finally broken off the relationship, but guess what he goes and do now/ he keeps sending me sweet love messages and telling me he’s going to change his ways, (like I haven’t heard that before!). If that doesn’t work, he tells me I’ll regret leaving him and now he’s threatening to kill himself! what do i do?

20090203054322AAJyPrn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do women have a problem with understanding the abstract?	I told a girl onetime after she had been looking for her keys and found them on the table where they were in front of her the whole time, that those keys had been there the entire time and they were as plain as the nose on her face. She looked at my seriously and asked, "What does my nose have to do with my keys?"    Thinking back I can think of literally hundreds of situations where this same thing has happened with hundreds of girls.

20090203054748AAfFBrI	Family & Relationships;Friends	Girlfriend vs. Friend?	Whats the best course of action?       my Girlfriend thinks my Friend does not like her - in some respects i can see were she coming from -    he can be a bit single minded and recently is not acknowledging us a s a couple - only referring to me and talking to me. we have invited him out socially on a number of occasions but he has declined. We've been going out 1.5 years and are very serious - we spend most of our time together.      I feel trapped as to what to do    should i confront him and ask if he has a problem with me, with her, with us?       he is a long term friend but its has seemed one sided of late. i always put more efforts into my friends than they do me.      i don't want to let my GF down either by doing nothing about her feelings..      any ideas
20090203054901AAy51Th	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Help with my abusive relationship?	WARNING LONG MESSAGE. sorry it just makes me feel alot better talking because i have no one to talk to anymore i have no friends and no life! i need advice on my relationship?      last night was nothing he smashed my phone for a third time and told me to to stop being a moody cow about it cause hes not like me he only breaks stuff he can fix.   If i get up to leave he locks the doors and takes my keys and hides them, thats wat happened last night and when i tried to stop him he threw me on the bed put my legs over his shoulders and got right up in my face screaming do you want the police round taking your baby off you is that what you want?? And when i started crying he ripped my joggin bottoms and pants off and and i knew exactly what he was gonna do cause it happens everytime i try to leave. ive never been so man handled in my life, hes just as bad as my ex was.      I asked him why he does this to me and he said last night 'its the only thing that seems to stop you shouting at me and you calm down after.'   so i told him i didnt want that and he let me pull my pants back up   and i just sat crying my heart out for a good hour. He hasnt got a problem with restraining me. And i know this sounds stupid but he scares the **** out of me, and thats why i dont wanna have the baby cause i cant stop thinking if he can do this to me when im 7 1/2mnths pregnant, what the hell is he gonna do to me when im not? Hes not gonna think twice of hitting me is he? I HATE the way he shouts at me with no thought of my little baby. I reach to grab a pillow to muffle the screaming for her/him when hes got me pinned on the bed and he laughs at me saying do u really think thats gonna make a differnce when ur cryin and wailing yourself stop crying, stop stressing your hurting your child! He tells me im a pyscho and that if i ever stopped him from seeing his child he'd kill himself and me. Hes even done it in my mums car while were driving down the v4 spitting in my face, swervin the car to scare me screaming while he's goin at 60 and just honestly petrifying me.      And i dont llike it. he makes me feel like its all my fault, like i deserved the glass of water he threw in my face when i travelled all the way to stourbridge to see his family and friends and let him get coked up and stoned with his mum and coo over my belly. just because i moaned at him for gettin trashed in front of me when he promised e wouldnt. And cussed my mum off for ringing the pigs when she didnt have a clue wat was goin on because i rang her and she gave them his mums address and they showed up at hers in dudley! It was horrible! New years went so wrong for me, i was travelling back on a coach the percentage of it alone cus j wanted to stay with his m8s, crying cause id be degraded and made to look like a twat again.      And the only thing he seems to throw in my face is that im just as bad because ive hit him when heS REALLY made me snap. When i havent wanted to be shouted at or undermimed. Or when ive been a dick and gone and sniffed k just to block him out. I stopped it now and i can honestly say its never been harder to deal with his attitude now im not trashed all the time. But i cant do either of these things to my baby anymore and its killing me cause i dont know what to do cause ive never loved anyone like this and Im stuck. sorry for venting im just so isolated and depressed all the time, and everytime that little bump kicks or sticks its little bum out at me i get so sad because i dont know what ive done to myself or them, and where are we going to be in a year from now. Im so scared, so lost. I really dont know what to do. Sorry sorry sorry im just losing it now.

I see him looking at me and sometimes I look back and smile a little and he doesn't turn away until I turn away. Whenever he says anything funny he looks over at me to see if I smiled or whatever. The table he hangs out by at lunch is next to mine and today I'm pretty sure he was looking over towards me.      And today I was walking to class and he was nearby and I think he said, "Hey, Jessica, you know I like you right?" and it was really loud in the hallway so I wasn't really sure what he said so I said, "What?" then he said, "You know I hate you right?" and I said, "Uhm okay." and then he said, "I'm just kidding."      So yeah, if you help me that'd be pretty amazingly cool. (:

20090220154845AAoSyXY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I was wondering if he likes me...?	Ok, so there's this boy that I think likes me. He's always staring at me in class or anywhere he sees me. And he holds the stare, but sometimes he looks away. And like, if we're walking in the halls, his eyes will follow me. And it seems like he tries to find any reason to talk to me, but this is usually before class starts when his friends aren't around. After that, he just hangs out with them, but he still stares at me. And sometimes I wanna go up to him and be like "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT?!?!?" But I wouldnt do that cause that would be mean. Lol.      If he does like me, it's not a bad thing cause he's cute. He's in the 9th grade and I'm in the 10th, but he's too cute to give up just because of age difference.

20090220160908AAKWtP3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im having mixed feelings about this guy please answer?	ok well i kinda like this guy im a junior in high school and ive liked him since my sophmore year. im having mixed feelings about him now. like ive lost interest in him all of a sudden. our turnabout dance at school is at the end of march, and my friends are telling me to ask him but theres one problem: i dont talk to him      he has no classes w/ me, we did last year so he knows me its not like has no clue who i am. and i  see him in the hallway sometimes, but i cant go up to him randomly and just say hi to him lol. so theres no way for me to really talk to him. and i dont know what to do now. should i ask him... or not. i have a feeling he might like me but is too shy to do nething about it.       and then im 16 going on 17 my b day is coming up and i feel like i have to ask him sort of because since ive never had a boyfriend :( that might sound stupid but ive been isnecure about that. and i was going to talk to him on facebook, but then it probably will be rly awkward since ive never rly talked to him.         any advice? i cant make up my mind on what i should do because im having mixed feelings now. i know if i dont do it i will regret it but then if i do will it be super awkward?       last year he did come up and talk to me once, and i saw him outside of school and he waved. but i was too shy to do anything about it then. im a lot more outgoing now.

So I was walking down a hall at my college, and a mom and her little maybe 10 year old son come out of the cafeteria and she is saying bye to her friends inside and as soon as they get out and the door closes she screams at her son saying you stupid retarded dog you embarrassed me, stupid idiot stupid moron lay under the dirt (most of the insults make sense in my language) and she was screaming in a low but rough way...and i just got flash backs of all the times my mom talked to me like that when I would say stuff like you promised me this or asked for something too much in front of others...and i wanted to tell her shame on you your child will never love you but she would feel more embarrassed and take more anger out on him...i am 18 now and try my hardest to never talk to my mom, when i do I curse her out to not talk to me, and she always either says why dont you love me or will say the same stuff as that lady, still!      i this lady made me realize how much i hate my mom

20090220161352AAUrH1h	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do others think about an open marriage?	My husband has been talking to a married woman online that is in an open marriage. I found naked pictures of her in his e-mail the other day and I went off. Her husband sent my husband an e-mail stating he didn't mind if they flirt, have phone sex, or an open cam. I think this is wrong!!!!!! I say it is disrespectful to your partner. I think any kind of flirting is but he doesnt seem to agree with me. I think you should only do these things with your spouse. Am I just old fashioned. What do all you others think?

20090220161819AAHFzdZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Love triangle :/ HUGE MESS. gahd. this hurts?	help me please   !      Okay, so my friend is dating her boyfriend of 4 months. All of the sudden she meets another guy. She starts to like him, ( i see why, everything he says is flattering) which causes issues. She had mentioned to me that he sounded like my type. she was talking to him. I was talking to him. He told ME that he loved her. and really wanted her to break up with her bf. The next day (after talking to him almost non stop) he decides that he llikes me. i am fine with this. it doesn't matter to me. well he decides to stop likeing my friend, which then means that he won't be flattering and poetic with her. this upsets her because then he wouldnt be the ssame guy that she knew. i asked that he still stay friends. i havent agreed or even said if i like him or not, because to be frank.. i dont know if i do. well her bf gets upset because she had feelings for the new guy when he came around. and SNAP of a finger. he now likes me. how can you say that you love someone one night, and the exact following say you dont love them anymore and you like someone else? when he told my friend he was going to normal and not show emotion with her, she cried. she was upset. this is getting annoying! she wants to be friends and keep everything the same, just take her feelings for him away. he is afraid that it wouldnt work because she loves the way he talks to her.       meanwhile, my friend and i vowed nothing wrong would happen, we would lie to eachother, and we would be honest about EVERYTHING. well today, she lied to me, and her bf.       this isn't necessarily a "should i like or do i like him sort of thing" it is a i need help with the situation. i think that he still has feelings for her. and she has feelings for him. he texts me, while he is on the phone with her, and she won't answer to her bf. she lies and says that she is doing homework. she told me the same thing when i called. i dont know what to do. i am trying to figure everything out. i am going to talk to the non bf guy and see what is up.       any thoughts?

I just left a 2 year relationship and im glad i did. I wasn't happy at all and the guy was such an a hole and i know he knew he was but still he acted all  heartbroken, hurt, and pity-full about me leaving him, when the reason we were breaking up was because he was a complete jerk. He kept me around when something was wrong in his life and he needed support and love, and when he was doing great i didn't even exist. He cried and asked me to not break up with him.Whats up with that? I know a lot of girls with this same situation.
20090220162248AAmKZvQ	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Would running off be a good idea?	I'm 18 and in my senior year in high school.  Recently I found out that I'm adopted and have been having a hard time.  Though that isn't the problem.  My entire life has been controlled by my mother, and I'm getting pretty fed up with it.  I have two sisters who i love dearly.  Now to the problem.  For the past few years I've felt a bit out of place in my setting.  I enjoy school and have plenty of friends and my family loves me, but I keep returning to thoughts of a simpler life.  I feel like I would be perfectly happy living in a cabin in the middle of nowhere with little to no possessions.  This year the thought occurred to me that I could just leave.  I have plenty of money that I could get to, and I'm proficient in the wild(I can find food in the woods if necessary).  However, I know little about this kind of thing and don't know people extremely well.  My plan is to find a small town somewhere fairly far from where I currently live and basically sever ties with my family. (perhaps I'll contact my sisters after a bit)  I'm not naive, I know that the world is dangerous and that tis won't be easy and that I can't undo what I do, but I really feel like I should at the very least seriously consider it.  Any ideas, hints, tips, advice?

20090220162646AARTNqV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I tell if this girl is interested? Also, what to do at this point?...?	Alright, so I started talking to this girl, and kinda figured she would be my type, but wow, she is so my type. But that is part of the problem, because I don't want to mess up, I get nervous around her sometimes. Now it is weird, I have never really encountered this with a girl but what happens is if I talk to her in school, she will totally answer my calls, text me, and it is VERY obvious she in into me. We talk for hours, and just have a good time.  My brother told me to try playing hard to get, so I did this, but by doing this I pretty much COMPLETELY ignored her, and she doesn't reply to my texts, calls or whatever. Is this a good thing, like is she saying she wants me to talk to her by ignoring me in return?  Also, in order to start talking to her more in school, I am in geometry class with her, and up until now I have never partnered up with her, and for that matter, even acknowledged her.  Would it be weird if I all of a sudden asked her to be my partner, or would she be weirded out since I all of a sudden decide to acknowledge her now?  Is there also any trick to talking to her when she has her friends around her? I ask because girls friends can really sway the girls decision so I want to make a good impression.  Also, in order to combat the fact that I ignore her, she kinda ignores me in the hallway, so should I start saying like "Hi so and so!"  At this point, I can tell she is into me, I just want her to stay into me, and hopefully ask her out on a date or something. Any advice is very much appreciated.       - Also, I am normally quiet in the class we are in as I am not familiar with anyone there, so I also feel weird even looking at her, talking to her in class. Any way I can get past this stupid nervousness I have?       Thanks so much!   -Chris-

20090220163328AAcpjQ5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do many husbands leave their wives in this way :?	My husband and I have been married two years, and it has been difficult from time to time. Husband recently took a job that requires him to be gone a week at a time, sometimes more. His last marriage ended rather ugly (wife cheated on him) because he did the same thing--was gone all the time. He has told me on numerous occasions that he realizes that was a big part of their problems. Until recently he swore he'd never take a job that required his being gone because he knows the consequences of being apart.   This is scaring me to death now that he has once again taken a job like this. He denies any thought of wanting out of our marriage, yet he seems perfectly satisfied to be gone, avoids any type of home responsibility, and even after being gone he doesn't seem to be all that interested in sex.

20090220163619AAnBwZL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do men really hate flat slim girls?	I'm 17..      I'm always hearing how men like bigger girls. Every magazine I look in, I see people trying to make bigger women feel better by putting thinner ones down. "Only bigger girls are real women," "Did you know that men prefer a size blah to size blah?" Sure they don't want an anorexic girl, whose ribs stick out but if you are naturally slim and not unhealthy looking, is that still bad? (I'm also 5'9" so maybe that makes it more obvious..) Well done for giving some of us a complex, media.      I'm so flat. It's straight up, straight down. I seriously must have a freakin hormone disorder or something. It's so horrible, I'm so unfeminine. I couldn't blame a man for not wanting me because of my chest. Sure, they'd feel like a paedophile or something. You'll tell me I'll grow but I really don't think I will...this is me and I'm going to have to accept it. I've never met anyone with as flat a chest as me! I must be 1/1000      My face isn't ugly (I think!). I don't think I have a horrible personality and I believe I'm not a bad person either. But what does personality matter? A man could never be attracted to me with a body like this...if he was, he must have serious psychological problems.      This gets to me so much. I'm extremely self-conscious. I can't take a jacket off anymore in case someone sees me...now you're going to think I'm such a shallow little girl but every day I think about how I'm doing to end up alone because no man will want me. I don't want that to happen.      Are there any men out there that actually don't care?

20070320173224AAaRiZU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE help!?	i got my ears pierced about 6 1/2 weeks ago with a piercing gun. I was unable to even get the first earring out. I was told that after six weeks you had to change earrings. I went to the doctor and he took it out for me. Behind my earing was huge chunks of dried blood. Apparently the lady who had done my earrings put the back of the earring so close to my ear that i was unable to clean behind it. Now every single day since my ear has been scabbing and has a big bubble behind it. It hurts really bad every day to change my earrings and the hole is sole small i can't even SEE IT! I've never seen an earring hole so small! Every time i stick a new earring in it hurts a lot and bleeds. I can't even stick it in myself due to the fact i can't see the hole i get my roommate to do it for me and even SHE has problems seeing the hole. Are earrings supposed to hurt and are your ears supposed to bleed the first few times you change earrings?

20070528133353AA0cG9d	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This Really cute girl I know...?	I know this girl and shes really cute. I normally fallf or blonde    and shes a brunette (or dark blonde).   I really dig her, every aspect about her is sweet and I just cant stop thinking about that smile and her crazy behaviour.      question 1.   Should I tell her? Would you  as a girl like for a guy to come up to you and tell you how sweet you are?   Will it work? Or shoudl I tease her a bit and bust her balls?   david deangelo said I shouldnt, a girl wouldnt like that,    it wouldnt generate any attraction since she prolly wouldve got sweettalked to all the time. I should be more rough and not give her attention that much or somehting.   Whats your opinionabout this as a girl?      Please try this, after reading this, dont post your answer,   but reread and this time use your feelings and tell me what they say..      question 2.      Im ugly as fawk. Still I like to believe (I guess) she sometimes tries to come close or whatever. Putting her arm around me, coming up to me to chekout my jacket -->

20080620070342AA1bnNE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend's new thing is getting wasted and telling me he's in love with me?	And not ever mentioning it sober? We're both 20, and a real relationship is new to both of us. I've been dating (a lot) since I was about 16 but I was never in any serious relationships. I was just having my fun and the flings ended after a couple months. He's in the same boat, we are both in our first real relationship. It's closing in on a year in a couple months, and I'd like to say I'm in love with him too (because I think I am), but I'm scared to say it. I've never said that to anyone before, I come from a broken family, no one's even told me that before. And the fact that he only says it when he's wasted makes me even more uncomfortable to say it.

We set the date when to hand out but i wasn't able to make it. i apologized to her, days passed and classes ended,I called her to tell her that it was glad i had her in my class she  then said what that date, she would like to still have it.

20081011220206AAutMEF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Dealing with Jealousy?	First off I just want to say that this may sound like another "kid relationship story", but I'm just going to say it now; if you won't help, don't bother answering.   A week ago was our school's homecoming, and I was lucky enough to be going with my "crush" of nine months. Anyway, things were going fine until one of the guys in her grade (Me: Sophomore, Her and Him: Junior) came up and pretty much swept her off her feet. At that moment, I was ANGRY, as if the plane I was flying in was burning and falling to the ground.  For the majority of the dance, he was with her, making her giggle and smile in ways that I could not.   So, emotionally driven and only half thinking,  I shared some of my feelings towards my "crush" (online, because I would've totally lost it if I did it in person) and I was rather confused with the results. Nothing has really changed, except I have noticed she is a bit more reserved when I talk to her. This made me even more angry, as I watch her being overly-friendly to most of the other guys she is around. It is now getting to the point where I can't handle it anymore, and I just want to tell her everything I am feeling. The only problem is that I don't want her to withdraw completely, as that would destroy me. I just want to know how I can deal with my jealousy of her guy friends.       Thanks for reading, I hope I didn't make you fall asleep out of boredom, and thanks for answering (if you did).
20081103111128AA86Giv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend just doesn't want sex why?	I don't get it my boyfriend of 18mths has suddenly admited that he has issues with sex.  To be honest we have hardly ever done it anyway and when we have he acts really odd about it.  We waited 6mths before even going all the way in the first place as he wanted to wait this time round whereas before he did it after about 2mths with his exes.  He makes every excuse there is under the sun to get out of us going that far.  We have a love hate relationship luckily for him therefore it is really easy for him to keep saying that because we have fallen out and had an argument it will take time for us to build up to the sex again.  He tells me that his first girlfriend which was like 16 years ago tied him up during sex everytime they did it and she totally took control of him.  He hated it and ever since it started him off on a downward slippery slope.  He also said the other reason was that back then he could keep it up for longer and keep going for longer and felt like he was a stude at it but now he feels rubbish at it and has been with 5 girlfriends since the 1st one and each girlfriend has felt the same unsexy, rubbish, unloved etc. because of the fact that they had a rubbish sex life because of his issues.   I don't get it why would you get issues over something like that?  So what that he was tied up everytime surely that can't spark that kind of issue?  He said that he felt she wanted him for the kinky sex only as opposed to wanting him.  The thing is with us it is totally the other way round and he has to be the one taking the control and I am the one who is tied up everytime.  Luckily for us it is the way I like it anyway.  He seems to like it like that as well but nowadays doesn't even seem to particularly want sex.  The thing is it has become a problem between us now as we have got very serious and close and I did suggest that he maybe sees a counsellor or something.  He said maybe.  I keep saying to him that he is keeping something back from me but he says I am being silly.  Everytime I raise this problem he freaks out, tells me that I am the one with the insecurities and that he does want sex but we have to build it up slowly, he has to not feel pressured into it and he has to feel close and intune with his emotions.  I tell him that he obviously doesn't love me and that he can't possibly fancy me because surely all guys want sex every second of the day?  Well the people I have known in the past anyway.  He says that his sex drive is quite low as well and that

20090220114946AAsqlEd	Family & Relationships;Family	I am just like my parents and quit frankly, I don't wanna be, well in some ways, help?	Well last night i was having a discussion and I was realizing I was going about it the exact some way my parents would, and I was talking about how if I had a daughter I would not let her date a 21 or 22 yr old if she was like 16, because of the fact I wouldn't know how he would treat her when she went out with him, which is what I know my parents would say about a situation like that, and me and my parents disagree on a lot of things, but on a lot of things I think exactly what they think.   My question is is it wrong to not want to be like them in some ways.
20090220123544AAYi8ZF	Family & Relationships;Family	I don't know what to think about my dad! Please, please help me?	I'm 14 by the way - so if I suddenly go into a hissy fit typing this, you'll know why, lol.      And please take the time to read all of this, it means so much to me as I am so, so confused.      Well, apparently, my dad was never brought up in a very affectionate environment when he was little. His parents never really hugged him and stuff, but they weren't abusive to him either.      Ever since I was little, my mum always used to be the one I liked the most. As most mums are, she was the 'softer' one out of them both. But the thing with my dad is, is that he scared me. Really scared me.      I remember when I was little, about 4 or 5, and I was in a school play, as an angel. My grandparents made me this halo thing, and whilst waiting for my turn to go up, I was talking to my friend and we tried on each others halo's. My halo got caught in her hair and they had to break it to get it out. (It's a bit funny, I know.) I know that most dads would be upset or even angry, after the time made to make something, but my dad just went crazy... I was really happy doing the performance, but after I stopped, I looked to my parents and my mum was smiling and waving and stuff, and my dad looked SO angry, and kept on mouthing 'Just you wait, just you wait.' This probably sounds really childish, but I was petrified.    After the show, I remember seeing all the other kids go up to their parents and them giving them a hugs and kisses, but my dad only started shouting at me and he hit me when we got home.      This happened throughout my childhood, every time the slightest thing went wrong, I'd get shouted at so badly, and sometimes even hit.      Today, after dinner, my little sister, who is 6, cleared everything up and put the dishes away. She never ususally does that so me and my mum were smiling and laughing and she accidentally spilt a little water over the sink when she put a plate in, and my dad shouted at her saying 'Oh yeah, it was bound to happen. Can't have one dinner without something being spilt.'   My mum then said 'Don't be so angry with her, she was only helping out' and I mumbled 'Well what do you expect, from him' and he started going on at me about how he doesn't get any support, and all he asks from me is that I wash up once in a while and feed our cat. I always try and help, but nothing ever seems to be enough for him.       I just can't get myself to answer back or to stand up for myself because I'm too scared of him from when I was little. I can't explain it, and I know it may sound really, really childish, but I am ******* terrified of him.      Then later on, he says sorry to me, and gives me a hug, and then my mum joins in and its this whole retarded family hug crap.    My dad has only hugged me about twice before, and I just started to cry because I hated him hugging me. I don't know what came over me, I just didn't want him near me, didn't want him touching me, I just wanted him to go away and leave me alone. I felt sick afterwards, I just felt sick and ran up to my room and started scratching at my arms.      Usually, he is only happy around his friends, or doing what he wants, then when he does something like ruffle my hair, I take it as something major. If he actually replies to me when I talk to him, I just suddenly feel like he is the best dad ever and that I love him so much... but it just seems like there is more bad stuff than good stuff, and that sometimes I am taking the things that a normal dad should do and just blowing them out into some big deal...      I probably sound like a psychopath now, but I'm just so confused. I don't know if I hate him or like him...      So to the people that have actually read through all this, thank you SO MUCH. Really... Thank you so so so much (:

My bf thinks im weird and calls me stupid because id rather stay in and watch football than go out with him. I love going out with him but he always decides to go out when the football is on. Its like he wants us to argue because he ALWAYS chooses to go out when the footie is on because he knows i want go out and he knows we will argue over it. He says he should be the one staying in for football and im the one who should be moaning to him but instead its the other way around. For the past couple of months he has gotten so pissed off with me, that yesterday he said that if i don't give up the football then he doesnt wanna be with me anymore because he doesnt get to spend time with me anymore like we used to, im always with him! He just wants to go out at the wrong times. He isnt speaking to me right now until i give him an answer about what im gonna do, him or football. I cant stop watching football because iv loved it since i was a lil kid. But iv been with him almost 3yrs now. Im so pissed off, why does he gotta be so fussy over something so stupid. so yea idk what to do. what do you think? and he means stuff he says, he doesnt say it just to scare me, he will leave me if i carry on being addicted to football. what would you do?
20090220142448AAoYiJ5	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is my friend always lying?	My one friend is always lying to me and my other friend about EVERYTHING! Like she said she could go to a concert and after I paid $59 for her ticket she said her parents said no and even saying she has to take insulin cause she is a diabetic when she doesn't even really have diabetes!    I hate this lying but I don't want to be rude and say how I feel: "I hate liars, especially some of your lies! Stop it!" I'm sure saying that would get her mad but what should I do? Why is she lying like this?
20090220153634AA0eZ0h	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is she lying to look superior, or is he just ungrateful?	My boyfriend was bugging me, to a new picture of me in my underwear, so i started talking to one of my girl mates (shes the most popular girl in my year, she has a boyfriend, who is my boyfriends like best mate)and, i was saying how annoying it is when he asks me for them 24/7 and he really needs to get a grip and realise im not going to be sending him all the time, cause thats not what our relationships about and she goes 'yeah bobs*(her boyfriend) exactly the same, he always asks me for them, so i just send them whenever he asks just to shut him up'.  Then when i was talkig to her boyfriend earlier he was like 'i aw them pictures of you on franks*(my boyfriend) phone(cause hes already got like 5 and i sent a few more), they were well nice ;]' then like 2 seconds later he went 'Franks* well lucky, atleast his girlfriend actually sends pictures like that, Karry*(girl mate, his gf) never does'   then he went 'omg, please dont tel her i said that' .   Do you rekon Karry* was lying, or Bobs* just being ungratefull when really he does have pictures, just not loads really often?         *=edited name.

Then , I found out today that he asked my friend out a couple of days ago and she said "no". Before knowing this, yesterday I asked him if he likes me or not, because it always seems like he does. Now, the WHOLE day today he's been SO depressed! Like sitting in corners and stuff... I want to make him feel better, so before he got on his bus I said "you seem depressed" and he said "mm" and I said "what's wrong" and he ignored me. Should I just leave him alone until Monday and see how he's doing then? It's really bugging me and I REALLY want to fix this. I'm heartbroken. Suggestions?      Thanks if you read all of this

My friend tells me that he does it to fit into the popular crowd. I'd never bring myself to that low of a level.   I want to help him so bad but I'm kinda shy.

Every time I can't make it to get together with a friend they interrogate me as to why....      and sure sure "there just being good friends" but you know, it gets irritating.

20090220154646AAdXCts	Family & Relationships;Family	Would you have 'spanked' your kid if he/she called you/your wife a b!tch?	My mum's been having a real tough time at work; our dad recently left us (D=), so she's under lots of pressure.      Anyway, at dinner tonight, my 9 year old sister (I'm 16), called her a   b!tch because she wouldn't let her have pudding.   My mum just started crying.   So I took my sister by the hand, lead her into the living room, and spanked her on her undies. Not in a abusive way or anything, but hard enough to hurt for a few hours.      After that I made her apologise to mum, then go to bed.   I started to feel guilty; was I too harsh?   And I know this sounds like a perverted, troll-ish question (it's not supposed to be,) but should I let my sister spank ME so we're even?   =S

20090220153334AAhsKGv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get to know her?	I really like this girl who lives on the floor above me in my dorm building, but I've only really talked to her once, and that was when I went up there with one of my friends who knows her because he wanted to get notes for one of his classes from her. But she seems really nice, and she's very pretty.      I just don't know how I can start talking to her, or anything, without it being awkward. Ideally, I would get to spend some time hanging out with her with just the two of us, but I would be happy just to get to know her better.      I was thinking, since I know she smokes, that I might go up there and ask if she wants to go out for a smoke with me, or maybe offer to smoke a blunt with her or something like that, but that has the same problem as any other option I can think of. It would just be really awkward to go up and talk to her, since I've never really hung out with her before. Also, what if she's not there, and then I have to tell her roommate why I'm there? It would just be really awkward all around.      Any ideas on what I can do?

Then she admitted feelings to her best friend (guy), who she knew liked her.  Mainly to make her ex jealous.  Low, I know.   Then her boyfriend said he wants her back.   He's a real jerk, who doesn't deserve her, but she wants to "give him another chance" even though that would involve admitting to her friend that she used him to make her ex jealous, and crushing his feelings.

Besides me, he only has one best friend who is more like a brother.. and I live far away so I can't go and hang out with him a lot. the thing is he's a typical guy and after he goes on his rants about his lack of life he goes 'well.. I'm just kidding' and tries to cover it up. I say things like 'come on, you have a life.. you have this and that-" but it doesn't help.       what to do in a situation like this?
20090220154411AAZE7cz	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why was there so much pressure for people to marry young back in the 1950s?	My history teacher told my class today that back in the 1950s, there was increasingly tremendous pressure for a woman to marry by the age of 20 and if a woman wasn't married she was in danger of becoming an old maid. And that most women then married around 18 and most men were around 20 when they first married, which was down from 21 and 24 back in the 1930s and 1940s. Why all of a sudden was there so much pressure to marry so young in the 1950s? My teacher also said that before the 1950s, there was higher proportions of people who never married and there wasn't as much pressure to marry at a younger age too. People who were 25 and still not married were considered selfish, immature, homosexual, weird, ignorant, and other names. He said that some of these feelings still remain but it's not until an older age and the pressure is less intense.

OK Well there are alot of issues in my family! and I dont know if I am offending my uncle he Is Italian by the way and he lives in Sicily but he is the only person that I could get in touch with and hes  my mothers only brother and they came from a family with strong family values and lots of respect! but I grew up in Australia and my mother has been nothing but a trouble maker growing us up....    I wrote a simple letter in Italian to my uncle and to let him know what was going on at home Is this bad??? I felt I needed  help and he has not responded me because hes probably offended and doesnt like me talking bad about my mother!    here if you want more of a clue of what I said this is the letter I wrote him translated in English         Hi Zio Salvo Im Alessandra your neice   How are you?   I hope everything is ok and family too   As for me i aint doing fine.. Im having a hard time with mum for many reasons witch im gona mention in this email I thought to write because I need help. I realy dont know what to do because mum has changed, she got with this guy that is 27 and he is indian by the way..   He is using my mum because he wants to take advantage of her and shes giving him money. But that is not the problem...The issue is that she is doing what ever he says which I dont think is right and she is acting bad to me and I know for sure that this Indian guy wich she claims to be her boyfriend is really an asshole to her.. He beats her up and once he put a knife at mammas neck so mama got scared and went to the police about it and see how it went but after all she is still with him...without thinking about conseguntion of her actions and without caring about me... So I realy don't know what to do and im so depressed. I spoke to dad about everything and he thinks like me. He is also having problems with her and she is bad to him too like she trys to blame dad on everything just because the indian guy is jelouse about my dad...hes provoking alot of problems with my dad he came into my dads home and whacked him over the head to the floor and mum doesnt say nothing about it and took her boyfriends side.... She aint calling me anymore and not sending any kind of money only dad is supporting me like a real dad should do and hes showin me so much love while mum is over there with this indian guy and forgot about me... Whenever I call her she dont want to be botherd with me and she always hangs up on my face and while im tryna tell her that I miss her and still love her. But I kept trying to call and while I was talking to mama thiz indian got on the phone and started to talk **** on me calling me many many names that I dont feel to mention right now and told me that im a bad daughter witch he cant say anything to me because im not even his daughter and said to me that I have to quit calling mum because he says so and he also claimed that the house in Australia that mum promised me is his house now. Because mum put it under his name and she confirmed it too. I cant realy pass over this zio I passed on many things because thats mamas life and even if she is wrong and she forgot about me I still respect her but I cant pass on this. This house is mine no jokes!! Im mad seriously can you believe Im her daughter and she gave the house that is suposed to be mine to and indian ***? So zio this is all messed up I dont know what is happenin to Mama and im trying to help her and understand her and what does she do? She gave out my house under the indian guy so hes the owner of my house. Can you believe this?? Unfortunally I am over here in America and I cant do much about mum and mum by the way wont listen to me at all so I hope you help me out with this. The only help I am recieving comes from my dad hes the only one helping me out. Im studying like nonna wanted so as you see I try to be good anyway zio I hope you can help me because I realy need a hand I dont know how to handle mum by the way Im sure that if you call her she will probably tell you that I am a liar which is not true so I know you are a wise man and I hope you will understand that everything is true I wish you can check it out your self because im pretty sure she will tell you that I have lied so I want to know zio I want my house back its mine tell Nonna whats happaning and please help me zio im so sad you have no clue how I feel Im having a hard time and maybe ive lost the only house I had..

I have a bf,but I want other guy,no matter how hard I try.(My bf doesn't call me as often as in the past.) I know this guy from soon. I really fall for him and like him. His clothes are not pretty, but I can see his muscles under 'em and I want to rip 'em off. He sometimes looks at me very sweet. I find 'excuses' to touch him (I can't without it). When I tried to come near him, he said 'I'm busy' and also when I sit next to him he stands up and sits somewhere else. He has a son, I didn't know, I was badly surprised. He laughed at my expression.    I guess he doesn't want me, but sometimes he chats with me in skype not for short time. Today, in skype chat I told him I want to ask him something,but I am afraid of the answer, he told me this conversation is for beer or vodka and invited me some time, when we don't have business to go out for a drink. He's much older than me, I feel ashamed. I don't know if he just wan to take me out just as a friend or not... I don't know, I can't ask him straight.

In them were pictures of him and then one of him, my dad, and dads wife. That picture was in a homemade frame thing and on it spelled family. Well I wasn't asked to be in that picture and I am his sister. It kinda hurt my feeling because I feel like they don't think of me in part of that family. I love my brother and visit him when I can, but I just feel like I am not wanted. Am I wrong for being mad for not being in the baby announcements? I mean we are 17 yrs apart, but still.

I am the ultimate good girl: in my mid 20s, I am still in my first and only relationship for 5 years now; never cheated, go to church... But I met this guy 3 days ago, he approached me, asked for my number and I gave it to him. First time I give my number to a stranger! I swear! The guy is simply passing through the state on a conference. We've been chatting a lot and I'm attracted to him A LOT. What's going on with me? I can't even imagine myself cheating on my bf. Of course i resist the whole attraction thing but been texting with this guy for 3 days now.

20090220150430AAL3JwP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is cheating always sexual? Or can cheating be something else?	I am in a serious relationship for almost 5 years now. Never cheated before. Never even think about it. But I just meet this guy on Monday he asked me for my number. I usually don't/never give anyone my number but for some reason I gave it to him. We've been chatting since Tuesday. He is a very nice, good looking guy who lives out of state; who is originally from another country just like myself (different countries but similar culture). I may never see him again. But something about him is intriguing me and we chat a lot. Nothing sexual... just nice conversation. I even wish I was single so I could go out with him or something...  Can cheating be other than having a sexual relationship with someone else?
20090220151429AAn1xc3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it possible for those feelings to remain amonst ex's?	My ex (dumped me) went from a few months ago saying he hated me (because i told his brother we met up as i was annoyed at the time and his brother takes the p*** out of him for it) anyway he now says he doesn't hate me but doesn't like me enough to want a relationship. I know when we were going out he cared for me alot and liked me alot..(we broke up because his brother was giving him grief about our relationship) & he even told me months ago that he still felt like deep down he cared for me a bit, i also rung him one time and was crying down the phone about our breakup and he was like "Don't be upset.." (in a comforting way) we have met up since our split and i have cried in front of him & he looked quite guilty he was like "its just ive never seen you upset before"... I mean because he cared about me alot at one point do you think those caring feelings will still remain to a very small degree? Is this usual amongst ex's (if it wasn't a bad breakup)?

20090220142202AAKxyc8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why guys do the things they do...?	Ok so I'm getting really tired of my husband saying he will or won't do something and doing the opposite. Its never anything big but it just gets under my skin. If you say you're gonna do something then DO IT! And vice versa. I know he has good intentions...but what the hell?!   And then this really sets me off...after I can't take anymore...I finally confront him and say (plain as frickin day!) aaaaall the things that he said he would/wouldn't do and explain how he did the opposite and ask him what's going on. He gives me that deer in the headlight look and then I can't handle anymore so I walk off and he has the nerve to come ask me "Why are you mad at me?"      I'm a newlywed so don't criticize. I'm just trying to understand men. We do not need counseling so please don't suggest it. There is never a 'big' deal about all this. Its usually about something like he promises to take out the trash and two days later its still there, so I end up having to take it out. No big deal really but I just can't stand that he says he's going to do it and he doesn't!!   Just no rude comments please.

I look good myself, but it still bothers me because those girls don't look good, they're PERFECT, and yesterday, I walked up to his car and he was flipping through it while he was waiting for me to get there, and this really bothered me. He was expecting me to call so it's not like he meant to be on the swimsuit page as soon as I walked up to his window. Every guy looks at other women, in real life or magazines, right? As long as they don't make it obvious and do it in front of you on purpose?

20090220154258AAWbqIg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it ok to flirt with my married neighbor?	My neighbor and I are both married, obviously not to each other.  Is it okay that we flirt occasionally?  Lately my husband has been away at work and it seems like we're drifting further apart, we don't talk much anymore and when he's home his mind is still at work. It's making me wonder if he is cheating on me while he's away.   I love my husband very much and trust him but there is that something that makes me wonder.  It makes me feel adored when he looks at me and we talk and flirt with each other, something that my husband doesn't do with me anymore. What should I do? I'm not going to have an affair with my neighbor, he's married and has kids, I'm not a home wrecker. What could bring that spark back to our relationship?

20090220145737AA8jR2X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I wait for this guy or not?  HELP!!?	I've been dating this guy for like 2 mos, been seeing him 1x, or 2x a week. He acted like a player at first and when I confronted him about it, he said that he's interested in exploring relationships w/ his dates and not into wasting time. Fine. When we do meet, it's always been fun, interesting, all good. When we don't, he never or hardly ever calls, asks me out on IM (yes, on text), calls me every week or other week. He wants it to be casual. Once I called him and he said that he's busy...ouch, that really hurt. We already got intimidate a few times. I really like him. He seems to have many mental issues (bipolar, depression). He's 39 (office manager) and I'm 32 (analyst). I just never know if he'll call me this week to ask me out or if i'll never see him again. Is this normal in today's dating world?? He tells me that once he decides to be in a relationship, he becomes a great boyfriend. He seems to want to control the shots in the relationship too. He says that I'm cute & attractive and that I could prob get other men if I wanted.      He won't go exclusive w/ me, does this mean that it's more likely that he's not interested than he is? How long do you wait before a guy commits? Does it in all reality, seem like I'm wasting my time? Does this sound normal btw people who are seeing casually?  Oh, he broke-up in a serious relationship about a year ago. Does this matter? What to do if the guy that you like is unsure about you, then when do you walk away or stop waiting (mentally check-out)?      Please don't tell me that I deserve better...I know that!!!...but this is my heart and he grew on me and I really like him. Just be honest, esp if you're a guy, what is he thinking? Thanks much.   xxx

20090220132010AA8cmST	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does she still love me?	My wife and I have had a rocky past year. I've been gone away alot working. I come home every 4 months. I feel like there's no romance, and no passion anymore. She never tells me I look handsome even though I remind her daily how pretty she is. She doesn't play with me anymore. We used to be touchey feely. I walk by her and touch her, or sneak a kiss, or a hug, and even grab her butt. She doesn't do the same with me anymore. When we go to bed she turns her back to me all the time. I used to love it when we would lay there and talk, and she would lay her head on my chest. That doesn't happen anymore. When we do make love I have to initiate everything. She doesn't rub me or touch me at all. She barely even kisses me anymore. She says she is always tired. This is really taking a toll on me mentally. It hurts me. I dont' think she is in love with me anymore. She is very special to me, but I don't think I do anything for her anymore. Any ideas?

20090220144122AAtqnSt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you resist attractive men while in a relationship?	I just recently started dating someone that I've fallen pretty hard for.  But around the same time I met him, I also met another guy who is very interested in me.  I find myself thinking about him a lot, like his eyes, his smile, and his voice when he sings to me.     One part of me yearns for him, while the other part of me knows that a relationship with him just wouldn't work, and that we aren't compatible people.  I'm more compatible with the man I'm currently with.  So, how do I get his face and his voice out of my head?  I want to stay with my current boyfriend and be loyal to him.

20090220152754AAGzbaG	Family & Relationships;Friends	Enemy crisis - HELP!?	well i have an enemy in my class, she used to be one of my best friends but things soon changed cos she wasn't the person i thought she was. She's really full of herself and has got TONS of attitude stored inside her, just not the perfect match, i'm much more polite and i despise the way she treats people but evry1 is nice to her because shes big and strong and popular.       Now the problem is; i am popular myself, i have my own individual style and she can't bear the fact that people like me. So she starts falsley accusing me of all sorts of things to make everyone think i'm evil and to officially kick me out of my group of friends so she can have them herself. How can i prove to everyone what shes really like??? it would mean alot if u helped cos i may end up with friend problems and people thinking of me as someone who i'm not.

20090220153350AAdMYFw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If a normally considerate & sweet guy answers his phone when getting a BJ...?	I have been dating this guy for about a month. We are both in our early 20's. We have gone on 4 dates or so.  He has been the one pursuing me & buying me so many things & wooing me.  He calls me during the week to make sure I'm ok & keep me updated, since he works a lot during the week - overall, he has consistently been very considerate and sweet.  However, on our last date, when I was giving him a BJ, his phone rang (it was his mom) and he answered it.  I was a little shocked.  Again later on, we were in bed & his best friend called, and he answered the phone again-- I don't think I was giving him a BJ at the time, but we were both in bed being intimate.  Third time, the phone rang, and he looked to see who called, but didn't pick up.  What do you think of this? I don't understand his behavior.  He canceled plans to be with his family and his friends, so that he could be with me, yet still took his phone calls when we were together (in bed)... is this a red flag for a man being inconsiderate, down the line?  Is this a subconscious sign that he doesn't take me seriously?  Or is it something pardonable, or something I should even bring up with him?

I wanted to start having sex 3 months into our relationship, and he "said" he did too. but whenever we tried, I never seemed to arouse him, and he always made excuses about why he "wasn't in the mood."      We finally had sex a year into our relationship, and it was really good. He seemed like he was really into it. But he never seems to want it as much as I do. Aren't guys supposed to want it all the time?       Another thing is, he is 18 years old and he claims he has never watched porn, never looked at nude magazines and has only masturbated a dozen times his entire life.       Could he be homosexual or just have a really low sex drive?

And she just really appeals to me, idk, but I just like her alot. Heres what sucks. She's not in any of my classes, and I don't see her in the hallways. I only see her on my bus. She has the 2nd stop, and I'm the first, so I have plenty of time to talk to her(like 40 minutes each morning). I don't know how to talk to her though. Hell, Im not that good at introductions. People fall in love with me n think I'm hilarious when they get to know me, but I'm the kind of person who only kinda good with people once they've been introduced. I like to be shown to people, n have them talk to me first.        How should I talk to her? I don't know what to do :(. I've never tryed goin up to people. And Im not used to how my school is, so I Isolated myself kind of(Im from Ny, n I juts moved to Fl) and things r mad different to me. How do I make this work out?      oh, n if this helps, she looks at me on the bus, I always sit behind her. n she usually(as in 9/10 times) she'll sit by herself. I always smile at her(i dun make myself look weird or anythin, just look into her eyes smile, then kinda glance away). N she turns around kinda n looks at me.

I have many relatives who think they can say whatever they want to you because your related. It's ok to speak your mind, tell the truth or joke around, but what do you do when their comments become insulting? You love em' so you don't want to bash their face in, then again you might feel like violence is the only way to get your point across because they don't want to listen to what you have to say. How do you handle these situations?

He didn't say anything to her and just ignored her cuz he thinks she's gross. Anyways, this just irritates me. I'm not upset with him because he did the right thing.

20090203062115AA0EM7G	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Lol my update got some weird answers I don't think ppl understood so explenations!?	Lol everyone took my update on me and my husband so wrong ! lol so I deleted it. My husband and I have a very LOVING and WONDERFUL marrige. we have both stayed loyal. The problem we had was about him lying about porn. We are working this out! All my friends are jealous about my relationship my husband and I have. He is a GREAT guy. Him lying to me about porn HURT alot. But we are in progress as of now! I had a long talk with him. I know I am hotter then half the girls in porn, I do not feel insecure at ALL!  Him and I being newly weds and young (21) I think we will be able to over come this and we already have alot! I love him more then words can say, and I KNOW he loves me! and we are more then ready for children! Him and I both! lol I guess on this site is not the best place to give an update because I get alot of negative answers. I am a firm believer in God I pray alot I try and go to church when I can. My husband also prays whenever he can. And we are moving forward. And I love my husband. LYING ABOUT PORN HURT ME! But we are moving forward and He can't even get online anymore...I put a password on the comp. untill I can trust him all the way. We have a GREAT sex life...and love eachother more then ever. He lied, yes it hurt...but moving forward and WORKING on this is wonderful!      =) I hope people understand better now!      If not, then I am sorry I couldn't explain it better. I was just SO happy because our realtionship is moving forward and I forgive him for the lies and he got the picture that it hurt and I believe him that he's done with it. All he wants are videos of me! =)      Oh and yes I have seen girls before I met him...I think me being sexually abused when I was younger had alot to do with that. He is a man that I trust and has made me better in life. Judging me for that is ridiculous. Your comments about that will be ignored. My husband and I are happy and moving nothing but forward and have alot of a better of a marrige then some people I know!       =) So I hope I answerd some of your questions!       <3

( both)        Does this game have a name?    Do you have any ideas for questions?

20090203060251AAaYDQA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why was my bf acting like this?	yesterday my boyfriend was acting really different.    ok me and him was together for a year, broke up for 10 months,   and now we been back together for 3 months.    the first time we broke up was cause he started acting really different. idk why though but his whole attitude change with me and everything. he wasnt treating me like i was his girl.   the 3 months we been back together have been really good. but last night my boyfriend was acting that same way as he did in our first relationship with eachother. he wasnt even acting like i was his girl. he wouldnt let me go to bed and kept me up all night when i have to start work early in the morning. so now i got a full day of work (9hrs) and plus i didnt even get sleep last night. he kept putting his feet on me, kept laughing about it. and the same thing happened the night before. i kept telling him to quit too but he wouldnt. it was so annoying and it really hurt my feelings cause when we first got back together, he was soooooo nice. he was a totally different person. he actually acted like he loved me. i miss that him :[   i tried talking to him but he must of had a stick up his a$s or something cause he wouldnt even talk like we usually do. we usually are able to tell eachother how we feel and if we are argueing we work things out.    im thinking a possible reason he could be acting like this is because hes poppin pills. last night he was sayin he popped 2 of this 3 of that...and then when we went to bed i saw him pop 3 more. that might be it or it might not. but i have to figure this out fast.   i gotta do something cause i do not wanna go thru what i went last time when we broke up. it was the worst day of my lyf ever.   why do u think hes acting like this??? what should i do?
20090203055745AAmuvjC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think that involving third parties?	such as family and friends, in your marriage is beneficial or detrimental to the success of your marriage?      I have noticed, from personal experience, that the only times we really involve our family and friends in our marriages is when things are not going well.  Do you think that our biased rants against our spouses, to family and friends, poison them against our spouse?      Or do you choose to keep what goes on in your marriage to yourselves?

20090203061707AAVd6zh	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What are my chances of full custody?	I have 2 granddaughters that I have had for 8 months (2 years old & 10 months). Their parents divorced.The mother gave up full custody to my son to be with a man on drugs who soon got her on them (She is up on pending drug charges as we speak). She has just moved back in w/ her mother who is no better. My son joins the military and they both signed temporary custody over to me. He is is NY living in a 1 room apartment. Cannot manage his finances. Remarries a girl after dating 1 month, now going through a divorce with another woman staying w/ him now. He has recently been talking to his ex (the mother of the children) and is mad at me because I will not let the children stay w/ her over the weekend. I am not wanting to take the children away from their mother. I just want whats best for the children. He is telling me he is going to try to get them back and give them back to her. I really do not think that will happen, but what I am asking is how hard would it be to gain full custody of the children? I live in the state of Ga. I have had the baby since was 3 weeks old. She only knows me. She has maybe visited the children 5 times for a few minutes. My son has only seen them a few times. neither have never given anything to help out. Someone please help me.

(family trouble!) any help?	there's been tension between grandma and me. i'm in my teen years but i'm not one of those stuck up obnoxious teens but i can be a b*tch. anyway, my aunt (grandma's daughter) is coming over and my two cousins. i think aunt's cool, chill person but grandma told her how i've been treating her. so i don't think she'll be cool with me the next time she'll see me, which is tommorow! (just because i'm a teen doesn't mean i'm obnoxious or disrespectful). i think grandma is downright rude, she's also sexist...maybe old-fashioned. sexist against females. treats men better than women. she pushes me out of her way. yells at me for every little thing that pisses her off. when i get sick and tired and yell back at her or glare at her. geez, everyday i have to go through this and ignore her as much as i can. but i don't think aunt will want to even talk to me anymore. ugh...

Way before this happened, I and my wife and kids are excluded from most family functions. My parents have, over the years bought all of my siblings houses and multible autos, but have never offered me a dime. I don't want their money, but is it fair of them to ignore my kids, grandkids and wife because they don't seem to like me? Is it fair of me to hold my ground and just simply disagree with her or should I be more of a "yes" kid and kiss up?

Okay, I had a serious crush on a girl last year, but didn't make a move due to her having a boyfriend. Now after the holidays, I don't know whether she maintains that relationship or not. Moving on, we were science partners last year as well, this year separate science classes. When I spoke to her, she made mention of how she wanted me in her science class. Then used the exact wording, "I want you, I need you", with no mention of science.       Help me? I don't want to fall for her if she has a boyfriend, but that phrase has me really confused.

We will be sitting my wife's younger siblings 12 and 16 (I don't know why they cannot stay home by themselves while their folks are in Florida for the race).  My wife wants to go see a movie, which is cool.  But what about dinner?  Where would be a nice place to take her for dinner?  And I was going to do some flowers.  But I feel like that is not meaningful enough.  I feel like it has all been done before.  Does anyone have any great ideas?  So much for a romantic evening with just the two pf us since the kids will be at the house...and I can forget about any bedroom action.  So what would be some meaningful ideas?
20090203061051AAVqbIx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this real love for him or .....?	When I wake up and before I sleep, I think of him.    Whenever I hear any love songs/break up songs, it reminds me of him.    When I feel or see something happy, I wish he's beside me now.    If he's sick/sad or lonely, I'll always be there for him.    I will do his laundry, iron his cloth, can learn how to cook ( just for him )    He just keep lingers on my mind 24/7.    I'll do anything to make him life comfortable.    I do get angry for his nasty habits ( getting drunk ) but I still accept for what he is.    He digs his nose and fart in front of me, I still love him.    I keep reading his IM messages, SMS es over and over again.    The thoughts of him  makes me happy and hurt sometimes.    What he said is always very important to me.    Always looking forward to see him or talk to him.    Seeing him sleeping beside me makes me contented.    Likes doing things for him, just for him.    Likes to tidy up his room.        Is this real love for a person?

20090203061721AASgs23	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do girls always do this to me? Did I do anythiing wrong?	I asked her if she would like to go to church on Sunday with me, she said yea and supposedly went to the Mall to get some clothes the next day because she said she didn't want to look like crap. I told her I was leavin for church at 9:55. She asked me what I was doing that night, and I told her I have to work from 6 at night to 6 in the morning. I called her at 9:00 that morning and got no answer. I then called her at about 9:15, then 9:38. No answer both times. Her truck was in the parking lot all morning. I even knocked on her door at 9:40 and no answer. Nothing was on in her room. I left her a message on the phone just before I left telling her that if she doesn't want anything to do with me, just tell me. Don't leave me hangin. I then sent a text message telling her that it was wrong how she did me and I am leaving her at God's mercy. She sent me a message that said "OMG, stop freakin out over nothing" I never got anything from her for a long time after that, then I sent her another message asking her why she did that to me, then she said I am making a mountain out of a mole hill and I need to stop freaking and taking it out on her.    I have been hearing about how she was hitting on several friends of mine   She also said her tags on her truck were dead so that is why her truck was in the parking lot, and she wasn't home, did I ever think of that. She wouldn't talk to me face to face, just text me.   I kind of like her, and was going to ask her out that sunday after church. I planned on taking her to a really nice steak house and paying for her food and everything. she has not talked to me period for a whole day. I appologized to her the next day because I felt guilty, maybe something came up and she had to leave that morning. Personally I feel she could have at least told me real quick she wasn't going with me when I called. Maybe she didn't have her phone on her, but then again, I have never seen her without a phone. Am I wrong for sending her the first text message? I feel like a bad person.  I am almost ready to give up on everything.  I have tried everything, I even apologized to her.  I feel so blue right now.  I kind liked her a little.

This morning on my favorite radio show they were discussing violence in teenage relationships. I was heartbroken by the comments I heard from the ADULTS about how they felt that teenagers should know better. Considering the fact that the schools are being browbeaten into teaching just the facts (forget sex ed, darwinism, etc.) and parents aren't in the best positions to be constantly focusing attention or even the best advice in situations, don't you feel like teenagers in general, and teen females in specific need more help and guidance out there for them to actually grow into functional adult women?

I was at a Varsity Bball meeting and I'm the only Middle school student(7th) everyone else was HS so its pretty difficult but anyway we were just talking about maybe somethings we could fix. We were silent for a few seconds then all of a sudden I just farted out of no where I didn't even know it was coming. And I did the most stupid thing. I gasped and made one of those "omg what did I do" looks and everyone started laughing there head off. Some were even crying because it was so funny to them >.< even the coaches who is my science and drama teacher! which is even worst because I have to deal with them the next day =S. Some of the HS like to tease me in a friendly way but im afraid they might blurt it out to like..the whole school xD my schools pretty small so word gets out quick. I know it doesnt sound serious but it was pretty loud and at the right moment XO. e.e So I'm asking if any of you got some embarrassing stories so I can feel a little better. plllzz hellppp

20090203062610AAJHjQ7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my Boyfriend cheap or do i expect too much?	Im used to my boyfriends paying for me for everything, when it comes to restaurants, cinama tickets, drinks etc   However, the guy im with now doesnt do this at all, instead though, he offers to split everything. I dnt know why but i find it really akward when it comes to money with him. Is it normal to split things between boyfriend and girlfriends? or do u think guys should take care of all that?   I might be expecting too much yes, but im just so used to being treated and pampered by all my ex's.. What can i do to overcome this, because its really starting to affect the way i actually feel towards him and he appears quite stingy now..

20090203061738AAKzYZG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do some men think relationships should be a one way street?	It seems like a lot of men want to be able to get away with things and treating us a certain way...But how come when we do it back, it's suddenly wrong? If a man wants to be treated right, shouldn't he treat his woman right? What's with the double standard...Why is it ok for a man to be certain way in the relationship and not the woman? Are they trying to be superior and set the standards for a relationship? What's up with that!!!

Over spring break, let your 16 yr old daughter take her and 2 of her friends to Chicago, just for a day...she would leave early morning, and be home at a reasonable time. It's about a 4 hour drive from where we live. She and her friend are both very responsible. Also, they would leave Chicago around 4 or 5, so they would be out of there before it was dark.

20090220155801AA1FclX	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Husband's bad habit, starting to infuriate me?	My husband & I have been married for 4 years now ( i was w/ him 2 years before getting married), and have two kids together.. He's 22. Just recently, about a 8 months back, he's developed a problem w/ pot. No, he doesn't do it around any of us, but he still does it. It's pissing me off SOOO BAD. Every time he gets paid, he waste at least 120 dollars on pot, every time. The rest of his money goes to me.. But he gets paid every two weeks, so that's 240 dollars a month WASTED on his bad habit. He's constantly high, when the kids are a sleep, but still. He smokes 10 times a day at least. If he runs out, he throw fits. Acts like an a$$hole towards me. Tries to argue and fight with me... Or he calls his fat annoying friend to come over and sit in the driveway w/ him and smoke together... I can't stand it, i've asked him to stop, but he won't... It's a constant battle with him... He has a problem and he won't admit it.. And i hate the fact his pothead friend comes over and sits in my driveway and smokes... he's always on the phone with this guy too, even texting. I swear to god he thinks he's 14.. I do everything, pay for everything, he does nothing but SMOKE. Please, is this normal? Are other families like this???? I'm like the husband, i do everything... he doesn't care as long as he gets his pot... so much money wasted each month.. what do i do? what do i say? nothing i do works, nothing... please give me some advice, anything. I know he's a loser..
20090220155904AAKpkQ8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What makes a confident man so nervous around a woman? How to approach him if he doesn't give you a chance to?	I'm 99.9% this guy likes me, because he acts a lot less confident and very awkward around me than he does with other girls. I like him too, and I would like to talk to him more and let him know that he can feel casual and comfortable around me (with no pressure or anything, just to be friends). Here's the problem though ... he never gives me an opportunity to approach him!  When we have the same class together, he high tails it out of the room right as the class ends and disappears. One time he told me to call him, and I did - then he told me he'd call me back and he never did. I know this isn't the way he's around any other girls - he has tons of girls around who like him, and he texts them and talks to them all the time. Could he be that afraid of his feelings? How am I supposed to help him out if he doesn't even give me the opportunity to?

20090203062114AAPoTCa	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is my husband cheating on me?	The past few weeks my husband has been "telling me what I want to hear". Tonight I found text messages in his phone to someone listed as "Matty". He was calling this "Matty" person princess in the texts and he had bought her phone credit saying not to worry about paying it back. I confronted him and he got angry saying it was disrepectful of me. Said she was a 17 year old he knew through someone and they were just sending bulls*** texts. "Everyone calls her princess, thats her nickname". He didnt say he would stop doing it either. My husband is 35! Why is he chatting to a 17 year old??? What the hell do I do? I have her number - should I call her?

What happen to the good o'l day's when girls would look for someone to love and care for them? Is it just me or do girls now-a-days actually like being mistreated?      BTW I'm 21, so don't take the "good-o'l-days" comment as my having age... just wisdom.
