tedOdb7jaa	i started smoking at age 13 i thought i was cool by doing it<br>  hang out with the cool kids and smoke with them.<br>  then i started geting yellow teeth and yellow fingers I started smelling bad so i would spray perfume on my clothes. i never figured out how much i sprayed on my self until i quit smoking. seven years later when i hated the smell of smoke and cigarttes and i could smell other people spraying perfume over cigarettes. IT smells disgusting by the way<br>  <br>  i think grade 12 i was smoking 2 packs a day, and i remember that when i didnt get my smokes i had a little ***** fit and spray painted my room. i was addicted. stupid addiction. It made me so sick<br>  i would cough up black stuff and hack and couldnt breathe.<br>  in gym class i could no longer run so i just walked. <br>  <br>  whn i was desperate for cigarettes in grade 9 i would pick them off the ground. and smoke them. do you understand how disgusting that is. I dont want you to ever get down to that level. There are so many disgusting things you can catch. Im lucky i never caught anything<br>  <br>  If your a smart person youd try to quit before addiction to cigarrettes rule your life and before long your puffing 2 packs aday and when you have no money your picking them off the ground.|`|0kJDcp1faa	so what? you want a cookie for being a badass?<br>  1.5-2 packs a day is way too much, especially at your age. your body is still developing and i can almost guarantee that you will have problems later in life. <br>  when you get a cold (or any other sickness) it will take you a significantly longer amount of time to heal. bronchitis will be the worst ride of your life. <br>  you will fool yourself into thinking you're not addicted, though you most likely will be. <br>  <br>  i smoke too, and i know the risks that come along with it, which are:<br>  cancer, wrinkled skin, nasty teeth, and heart problems... so i take care of my skin, brush three times a day, and run every morning (mostly).|`|Bgob427Faa	you may not think its that big of a deal<br>  but honey trust me it is<br>  an old friend of mine did the exact same thing you did<br>  she lost a ton of her friends<br>  started getting wrinkles at 15!!!<br>  yellow teeth, she always smelt like smoke which made me not want to be around her<br>  and trust me meth is terrible<br>  ur gonna be in rehab later in your life wishing you would have not of done anything that you do now<br>  plus your probably gonna die around your 30's from how much you smoke<br>  also theres no reason for it<br>  it really doesnt make you cool it makes you trashy<br>  please quit :)|`|pH6KRej2aa	Kids who smoke have significant health problems, including cough and phlegm production, decreased physical fitness and unfavorable lipid profile.<br>           and they usually remain very short...and that is what u don't want!<br>  <br>  <br>  According to the Surgeon's General, Teenagers who smoke were: <br>  Three times more likely to use alcohol. <br>  Eight times are likely to smoke marijuana. <br>  And 22 times more likely to use Cocaine. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nutri.com/smoking/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nutri.com/smoking/</a>        read that!|`|K0vWCxnXaa	I smoke and i am 16, i only smoke 2 or 3 daily depending on how stressed i am.

If you keep smoking you won't be able to stop and will be addicted to nicotine.  You must have heard all the diseases smoking causes.  Try to cut down a little every day till you can stop.|`|mdO8Z0XTaa	that's really unhealthy no to mention gross.<br>  and it will cause a early death or make you really ill.<br>  could cause breathing problems as well.<br>  <br>  Facts : every cigarette you smoke takes 5sec. away from your life.|`|oTFw9dkJaa	yes, its bad, at this rates, you will proably die at around age 50.<br>  and also it depends how much you smoke.<br>  and it it was good then it wouldnt be illegeal now would it?

At first I felt like everyone treated me like I was so fragile and I couldn't do anything for myself but once I got bigger and more tired now I really appreciate it. Gifts are a nice part. People can't resist baby clothes. :)<br>  Morning sickness, aches and pains from belly growing, constipation, being extremely tired sometimes, frequent heartburn, difficulty sleeping as the belly grows, painful kicks, tender breasts, stretch marks.... there are probably a lot of physical discomforts I could list, those are probably the main ones I've experienced and they come and go and come back depending on the trimester. I was really sick and had very tender  breasts through the first trimester and was exhausted. The second trimester was great! No more sickness, I had my energy back. Only downside was toward the end I got a little bit of stretch marks developing on my hips. The stretching belly makes for soreness in your pelvis and abs. That is sort of constant. Now into my third trimester and I'm tired again and a lot more sore with backaches and difficulty sleeping. The way I look at it though is that its temporary and the baby girl I'm expecting is worth it.<br>  <br>  Yeah way to be a jerk Julius. Teen pregnancy isn't a good thing but you have no right to demean the girl doing her best.
7Ox0nYH7aa	its not ur heart.its the sound of ur own eardrum pulsing.happens to everyone.ur ear pressed to the hand or a pillow,forms like a little tunnell that amplifies this sound.another position,or sleeping with the fan or "white noise" machine on,will mask the annoying sound.|`|OB2JbmFcaa	If you concentrate and do nothing else, yeah, I think so (I can sometimes feel it too when I'm lying down in bed).|`|I0g24Jmkaa	happens all the time.

GWz5KDTwaa	You may be having a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD).  That's where the vitreous pulls away from the retina.  The vitreous has several attachment points on the retina and flashes you see are where it's tugging at the retina.  There's a small chance that it could cause a retinal tear so you should get in to see an ophthalmologist ASAP, preferably a retinal specialist, for an exam.  PVD is also associated with floaters and it's normal for this to happen with age, but comes earlier in nearsighted people.  You will probably get used to the floaters and that's what the doctor will tell you to do.  But if they are really bad and you can't get used to them there is an operation called a vitrectomy where they can suck them out of your eyeball.  There are some associated risks to having this done so most doctors discourage it, but it can be done if necessary.|`|PlRYgRcoaa	It's a warning to put the pipe down|`|AA11762642	take some benadryle, great for side effects like yours, thats what the Doc told my kid n it works. good luck

BRDqfAy3aa	read below - Puberty and Breast Development - When Expect First Period-Menstrual Cycle-Reproductive Organs ...........|`|6qsocyK3aa	You skin might get spottier or greasier, your boobs might hurt, you might get stomach cramps, you might get irritable and moody, you might get headaches or feel sick.|`|HWzAip12aa	You could narrow that down by taking clues from your body. During puberty, when your body becomes sexually mature, you'll have some of these changes that show your period's on its way. (By the way, these changes may happen in a different order than listed here.)<br>  <br>  Developing Breasts. First, you'll get breast "buds". (Your breasts then can take up to 3-4 years to fully develop.) Generally you will get your period 2-3 years after your breasts start developing.<br>  Growing Pubic Hair. Right after your breasts start to form, you'll start developing pubic hair. It will be soft and thin at first, then gradually become coarser. Your period usually arrives around 1-2 years after the hair development.<br>  Discharge. This is the big sign. You'll start to experience vaginal discharge that will be either white or yellowish. If you like, you may want to start using Alldays Pantiliners to protect you underwear. You period should start around 6-12 (but up to 18) months after the start of discharge.<br>  There's one more way to figure out when you'll start menstruating: Ask your mom. You'll probably get your period within a year or so of when she got hers.<br>  <br>  Since you'll only have a  idea of when you'll get your period, you might want to do some planning.<br>  <br>  Most girls will use pads at least for their first period. Your first period will probably be fairly light so Always Thin Maxi Regular or Always Thin Ultra Regular would be a good choice of pad. If you are physically small, you may want to use Always Thin Ultra Slender. It's a good idea to keep a pad or two hidden in your locker at school, and carry another in your backpack. This way you won't be caught off guard when it does happen.<br>  <br>  Relax, you will get your period, and you'll have them for a long time!|`|0FSBiLQVaa	When you get your period, you will find red or brown blood in your underwear. It may be scary at first, but if you are prepared it will make the experience a lot easier. You should bring pads, tampons, or pantyliner along with you in your purse of pocket just in case. An adult like your mom or aunt is a great person to talk too. Before you start, you may have PMS or pre menstrual syndrome. It occurs before your period and girls may have headaches, backaches, craps, bloating, but it varies by ever girl. A  helpful site is www.beinggirl.com and reading The care and the keeping of you. It is an american girl book and you can find it at most book stores and sometimes places like CVS! Hope this helps!|`|oRZlNZk9aa	Dont worry about it will just come when its ready but you should have pads ready and extra undies in your backpack.

NSARVXkMaa	Inversion therapy will work better for spinal alignment.  Inversion therapy uses the effects of gravity to weight down your spine and stretch it out.  As this happens your spine is allowed to decompress and as that happens it relieves the pinched nerves in your spine.  Inversion therapy causes your muscles of your core (the hips, thighs, buttocks, back muscles and most importantly the stomach muscles) to stretch out.  As they stretch the knots and spasms leave and when these muscles are all relaxed they loosen their grip on your lower back muscles, your spine and most importantly your pelvis, allowing them to go back into natural alignment.  As they align this will cause your sciatica to vanish.  It's like if your car is out of alignment it pulls to one side and screws up the tires, it's the same with your back.  Inversion therapy will help align your spine and relieve your pain.  Hope this helps.|`|xkJZwnHTaa	chiropractor will be able to figure out what's wrong.|`|sAEYkNSqaa	You might have slipped a disk which is uncurable sometimes i'm afraid but i have had a back injury for about 2 1/2 years which keeps coming back every 6 months randomly normally when i'm running.

iZqSEQQsaa	Nothing out of the normal, really. I'm from hispanic and indian heritage and we are known for being a little hairy for girls. Different girls have different hair. With the eyebrows I pluck and occasionally I wax my eyebrows and mustache. But typically, regarding the stache I just do what the guys do. Shave it off. At first it was, of course, a private thing which I never let anyone know about. Then I found out a majority of girls have similar things going on. Then I realized that my boyfriends really know alot more about it than we'ld expect them to. They know it's actually perfectly normal. Even though it's just a couple of strokes and it's gone, I'll even do it in front of my husband, brothers, sisters, friends, anyone really, and you'ld be suprised to know that (unless they decide to playfully tease [usually the brothers]) they don't even bat an eyelash at it. It's more common and more known about than you'ld think. Shocking, huh? LOL|`|bVLRZh7Baa	I think you're totally getting your panties in a twist over nothing. Absolutely normal. Many women regularly take care of this small issue.

You can buy special bleachers for mustashe in the pharmacy.|`|a3bq277Gaa	I've never heard of that. Why don't you try bleaching the hair? If not, get it lazer removed or just shave it.|`|AA12034897	Haha, I have a teenie little line of hair there, it's because I just have dark hair. You can have laser hair removal, or do what I do, and get it threaded or waxed. Shaving supposedly makes it darker, so avoid that if you care.<br>  <br>  Threading, by the way, leaves the skin soooo smooth, and without all the irritation that waxing leaves.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Yes,take it easy,nature plays|`|BRDqfAy3aa	see below all explanations
vhlORK4Waa	PREVENT spreading boils to other areas of your body by using fresh towels or disposable paper towels with each treatment and washing. Also, wash hands immediately after touching the boil. Cross-contamination is often worse than the original boil. <br>  <br>  TAKE hot showers at least twice daily, instead of baths. The added heat and moisture will help the boil to open and drain on its own. Baths tend to spread bacteria to other areas of skin. <br>  <br>  APPLY warm water heat to the boil using warm or heated cloths or a hot water bottle. This can be done 3-4 times daily for up to 20-minutes at a time. <br>  <br>  OVER-THE-COUNTER pain medications can be used for painful boils. <br>  <br>  TAKE Vitamin C during boil treatments to help boost the immune system. <br>  <br>  DRAWING salves, particularly natural or herbal varieties, can be applied after heat therapy to draw the infection away from the body. Apply salves after a hot water treatment or shower and cover the area with cotton gauze. <br>  <br>  Once heat has been applied for several days in a row, the boil's outer coating of skin will appear thinner. This most often means the boil is getting ready to drain. DO NOT pop a boil. Popping a boil will only contaminate surrounding skin. Instead, apply a clean, cotton bandage or gauze pad over the boil before bedtime. This will allow the boil to drain naturally, exposing only a small amount of skin to the bacteria. After the boil drains, wash the area thoroughly and cover with a bandage or cotton gauze three times daily or until the area has healed completely. Not covering the boil after drainage has occurred may cause reinfection to the same hair follicle or skin area.<br>  <br>  You could go and speak to a pharmacist, they are trained to give advice on things like this (not the person on the counter, the actual qualified pharmacist) - s/he will be able to help.<br>  <br>  You might want to consider homeopathic treatment as an alternative.....|`|AwzXqB67aa	Just go to emergency room!<br>  Noone can diagnose you without actually seeing you and the last thing you want is to be misdiagnosed and misadviced. <br>  <br>  Go right now, no matter if it costs you some extra.

bdN3sTBxaa	There is only one person that can tell you -- your doctor.  A test conducted 2-3 years ago would hardly rule out something today.  There is one thing to consider:  You do not want the appendix to burst.  THAT would really cause problems.  So, as with all serious medical problems, the doctor is the only one that can give you a sound answer.  Good luck.|`|YTYOHR27aa	Other symptoms such as fever or headache?Try jumping on one foot.If you can you definitely dont have apendicitis.It does sound like a psychological thing.If you are still worried go to the doc!|`|vXTlqHoKaa	If you had appendicitis last weekend, and you didn't get it treated, you'd probably be dead by now.  My guess is it's something else.

When they are tight they contort and this is what pulls your lower back and pelvis out of alignment and this is what causes your discomfort and sciatica. the best thing for this is inversion therapy. When inverting all of these muscles are free to stretch out and relax. As they do the knots come out of those muscles and as they are free and lose they will release their grips on your lower back, hips and pelvis and allow them to go back into alignment naturally. Once they are realigned nothing will be irritating your sciatic nerve and your pain will go away. You just have tight muscles that need to be stretched out. Stress causes this too by the way. Hope you feel better and hope this helps you.

VCIZJQCJaa	i have a list of serious and mild side effects everyone experiences meds differently i found it to be as weak as extra strength tylenol.as with any narcotic comes a warning about using with alcohol it can damage your liver over time so that's your choice<br>   <br>  Darvocet<br>  <br>  1 - Darvocet is a combination of propoxyphene and acetaminophen.<br>  Propoxyphene belongs to the drug class known as narcotic analgesics, also known as opioid analgesics. Drugs in this class relieve pain by affecting how the brain perceives or senses pain. The combination of acetaminophen and propoxyphene offers more effective pain relief than either drug alone. Acetaminophen increases the effects of propoxyphene when combined with it.<br>  <br>  2 - Propoxyphene is about half to two-thirds as potent as codeine, but it can still be habit-forming.<br>  With Darvocet (propoxyphene and acetaminophen), physical and psychological dependence can occur in some people. Darvocet should not be stopped suddenly, especially following long-term use or high doses. If you have been taking Darvocet continuously for five to seven days, discuss how you should stop the drug with your doctor.<br>  <br>  3 - Darvocet is supplied in various formulations.<br>  Darvocet is available as Darvocet N-50, Darvocet N-100, and Darvocet A500 (tablets), as well as Darvon pulvules (capsules). All of the products are given orally. It is important that the maximum allowed doses not be exceeded. The maximum amounts of each of the drug's ingredient allowed per day are 600 mg. propoxyphene and 4,000 mg acetaminophen.<br>  <br>  4 - Since Darvocet contains acetaminophen, you must be careful about taking over-the-counter medications that also contain acetaminophen.<br>  Darvocet N-100 contains 100 mg. of propoxyphene napsylate and 650 mg. of acetaminophen (the equivalent of two regular strength Tylenol or acetaminophen). Due to potential toxicity problems, the daily allowance for acetaminophen is 4,000 mg. If you take six Darvocets per day, for example, the amount of acetaminophen ingested is 3,900 mg. Taking an over-the-counter cold or sinus medication which contains acetaminophen in addition to this will put you over the limit and at risk for serious side effects, as well as potentially fatal consequences.<br>  <br>  5 - Alcohol should be avoided when taking Darvocet.<br>  Alcohol can increase unwanted side effects when combined with acetaminophen and propoxyphene. Alcohol can intensify the drowsiness and dizziness Darvocet may cause in some people. Propoxyphene in combination with alcohol has been found to be a cause of drug-related deaths. Alcohol may also increase liver toxicity caused by acetaminophen.<br>  <br>  6 - Darvocet can interact with certain other drugs, causing dangerous sedation.<br>  Antidepressants, antihistamines, and sedatives used for insomnia, other pain medications, muscle relaxants, anxiety medications, and even alcohol can cause a dangerous level of sedation or unconsciousness, and even prove fatal, when combined with Darvocet. Darvocet should not be used if you have taken a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) in the last 14 days. Darvocet can also increase the risk of bleeding if you take an oral anticoagulant, like coumadin. Be sure your doctor knows all of the medications you are taking.<br>  <br>  7 - If you have any of the following pre-existing conditions, you should discuss taking Darvocet with your doctor. You may require a dose adjustment or more careful monitoring.<br>  Do not take Darvocet if you experience depression or suicidal thoughts. Before taking Darvocet, let your doctor know if any of the following apply to you:<br>  <br>  <br>  history of drug or alcohol addiction <br>  drink three or more alcoholic beverages per day <br>  kidney or liver disease <br>  asthma <br>  urinary retention <br>  enlarged prostate <br>  hypothyroidism <br>  a history of epileptic seizures <br>  gallbladder problems <br>  Addison's disease <br>  head injury<br>  <br>  8 - Little information is known about the drug's effects on a fetus. <br>  It is possible that propoxyphene may cause addiction and withdrawal symptoms in an unborn baby. Propoxyphene may also cause addiction and withdrawal symptoms in a baby who is nursing. Talk to your doctor if you are thinking of becoming pregnant or planning to nurse your baby. Birth defects have been noted in case reports of women taking propoxyphene during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  9 - If you experience any serious side effects while taking Darvocet, stop taking the drug and seek emergency medical help.<br>  Serious side effects include:<br>  <br>  <br>  an allergic reaction <br>  slow or weak breathing; difficulty breathing <br>  cold, clammy skin <br>  severe dizziness <br>  severe weakness <br>  loss of consciousness <br>  yellow skin or eyes <br>  extreme fatigue <br>  bleeding or bruising, which is unusual<br>  <br>  10 - There are common side effects associated with Darvocet that are less severe.<br>  You can continue taking the drug, but talk to your doctor about less severe side effects to determine if there may be a solution. Side effects which are considered common and less severe include:<br>  <br>  <br>  constipation <br>  dry mouth|`|nAp688tZaa	Darvocet is the weakest narcotic pain medication on the market.  Your doctor is more than likely switching you to this as a way to get you off the pain medications completely without having withdrawals.  You should not notice any side effects with this  med that you did not experience with the others.  You are now possibly opiate tolerant and will not experience any side effects at all.  As far as pain relief, this med is no better than a few ibuprofen, but it will still give you some narcotic and allow you to taper down from the drugs with little to no discomfort.<br>  <br>  Don't drink while taking this.  It contains quite a bit of tylenol in each dose.  To mix it with alcohol is a good way to pickle your liver!
mG2lZRrXaa	Go see a doctor. It could even be a reaction to the creams.
f8mLpPXlaa	Go ahead. If it's the DM I'd slow down on using it but if it makes you feel better go ahead.

(so, easily a 12 oz bottle even)<br>  <br>  If that ORIGINAL Robitussin is not doing anything--perhaps a different one would work better----but, it does sound like you ARE getting better....just not totally.<br>  <br>  Realize, that the cough medications are DIFFERENT....<br>  <br>  You do NOT want one that is a COUGH EXPECTORANT at this point---or, if you DO, not one the ENTIRE time---such as, at night, you would want a COUGH SUPPRESSANT ONLY--or, you will find yourself coughing VERY HARD.<br>  <br>  THIS would be a question to ask at the pharmacy counter---but, perhaps, you would be able to find some relief from a COUGH SUPPRESSANT--unless you have a PRODUCTIVE cough---and if it is productive for this long, then to go see your doctor to make sure you have nothing else going on (such as post nasal drip/sinus infection/ear infection--a quiet one even) or enough mucus sitting in your bronchial passages could lead to bronchitis/pneumonia if not dealt with soon--as the mucus may trap bacteria/or other germs--viruses, and and infection could ensue.<br>  <br>  Also, you do not want to STAY on the COUGH EXPECTORANT too long, as again, you may feel like you are "coughing up a lung"....and can damage the mucosial lining in your throat from coughing so hard...or bruise/break your ribs...---not fun.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you, and again, most pharmacists will GLADLY help you pick out the right medications to relieve the cough symptoms without interferring with your other medications.|`|zg2Ji3HWaa	Call a pharmacist and ask them.

You should buy the ready to drink variety, because they taste like the best chocolate milk you've ever had, just way, way healthier. Don't buy the powder, it's cheaper but doesn't taste nearly as good.  You can find it at bodybuilding.com. They also have a great forum there where guys can give you some really good advice.

pXPdO2I8aa	The Modern Treatment and Cure of the Bubonic Plague (aka Black Death )<br>  When an occasional case arises (normally of the Bubonic variety) Health Authorities will isolate the patient, trace their movements and destroy the rodent population responsible for the outbreak. This is easily done today but was virtually impossible in the 14th Century. Other events were required to stop the spread of the disease such as the Great Fire of London in 1666. In 1932, with sulphonamide drugs, there was finally an effective treatment for the plague. There is a vaccine, but because it takes several weeks to become effective, it would be of little use during an epidemic.|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	There was no such thing as antibiotics in those days, which was why it was so deadly. There are various medicines (streptomycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and fluoroquinolone) that will combat the bacteria in this day and age though.

bbn2YvrKaa	Based on your parents' blood types, you will either be A or B.<br>  <br>  The only way to find out is to have your blood tested.

Often if you're donating blood they will tell you your type (at least in Canada... not sure about other places)|`|9dvmMRX4aa	It's not recorded on a birth certificate but if you've ever had your blood tested they will always write it down so you can call the Doctor and ask them to check your records or you just get a blood test done and they can tell you (but I'm not sure why you would want to get a blood test for fun)|`|ExGzIJdpaa	Thats kinda funny.<br>  You're mom is a universal reciever and you're dad is a universal donor.<br>  <br>  but anyways, it should be on your birth certificate.|`|nxG8MSLNaa	The easiest (well, unless you don't want to) way to find out is if you donate blood, they will tell you what your blood type is.

It might be on your medical certificate if you've had an operation and they've taken some of your blood.<br>  <br>  Like somebody else has said, I think your blood type will probably be A or B.|`|94a46d94405353b1f3f1de9ec8eeca2aaa	It is not on your birth certificate, but it could be in your medical records.

You could get them into big trouble and jeopardize their lives.|`|WpaQKpckaa	Use protection and don't become promiscuous.|`|ugW9r4gRaa	In relationships at your age with someone so much older, you have to be aware of being taken advantage of. For one, its going to be illegal when he turns 18, so that is something to think about. It is up to the individual though to decide when they are responsible enough to have sex. The only concrete thing I could say is: use protection. Make sure he uses protection. Its probably not the best idea to have sex at your age at all, but if you are going to, you absolutely have to make sure he uses a condom, because being accidentally impregnated at your age could ruin your future.|`|Izv6Qj4caa	this is not bad..but i think u just need to slow down..dont rush things like this..i lost my virginity when i was 15 with an 18 year old..and i regret it alot now.messing with older boys usually leads to things u dont want or not ready for..ur 14 you have a lot of time to do those things..just try and stay within a younger age range..hope this helps|`|TXaMOQo6aa	just as long as you don't get pregnant and get an abortion, i don't care|`|KRJNjxJzaa	Sounds like he is using you.. but if u truley feel ur in love than just use protection..|`|5MTFXnGfaa	i think its wrong, im 15 and im waiting for sex till marriage you know he doesn't really care about you hes just using you i would rather have my first time be special and have the guy love me and that makes sex 1000 times better and you dont feel dirty or promiscuous|`|OhYE3GhKaa	it is a concern that you characterize what you share as not a relationship yet you are involved sexually. and the love word is no where in it.

He doesn't want a relationship because at 17/18 guys just want sex (for the most part) and to convince a 14 year old to is a little wrong and very bad. I suggest not spending the night at your friend's and stay away from her brother. He just wants to sleep with his little sister's friends because he's a horny freak or something. Stay clear and stay smart. You'll understand when you get older. Good luck~|`|NQKQ8tShaa	Well.. I think you're too young to be having sex, even though I lost mine when i was turning 16. You end up regreting it big time. You should've waited for someone you really loved.

But I'm not here to yell at you or judge you because I haven't had a good past either.

BG8vMyZjaa	Unfortunately, like many other skin disorders, there is currently no cure. This is partly because the condition is genetic in nature, which means that it will probably re-occur even if a person clears the symptoms. The good news is, KP is completely harmless and it is definitely no threat to the health of the sufferers, even though it might be unsightly.<br>  Treatment is sought usually for cosmetic reasons. It has been suggested that lactic acid and alpha hydroxy acid are effective in clearing the bumps as they 'peel' the upper layer of the skin. Salicylic acid is proved to be useful also. KP sufferers usually have dry skin, therefore moisturising is very important. Some people try soaking in hot tub baths and then rubbing the areas with a coarse wash cloth or loofah sponge.<br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1075583" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1075583</a><br>  <br>  Also look at<br>  <a href="http://www.biocutis.com/pilaris/" rel="nofollow">http://www.biocutis.com/pilaris/</a>|`|Zt6eh6VRaa	We have had good luck with a vitamin A proprionate lotion that we carry.

It didn't effect me at all and it won't effect you either...|`|nZ4cOSDZaa	well if you want too drink after your taken them then that's fine just don't over do it|`|H0e0YAZ5aa	Dear you should be fine, drinking in excess is never a good idea, ibuprofen or not.|`|r0l3Wd5Vaa	iron pills our just fine for women but men should stay away from them i think it's bad for our prostate.now alcohol is not good for the liver and ibuprofen has antihistamine in it also not good for the liver if you take to much,so when you mix the both its not really a good thing and can cause liver damage.but since you are only having one or two drinks i wouldn't worry about it always drink plenty of water the next day to help your liver flush out the poisons.

FqrKjtzwaa	Yes, it does even out to about 1250 calories a day - and it's exactly the same as if you just ate that amount of calories every day, instead of more some day, and less others.<br>  <br>  Anyway 1250 isn't a lot of calories, so you almost certainly will lose weight (in fact, this could be so few calories it's unhealthy). Here's a page to help you figure out your ideal calories for weight loss: <a href="http://www.weightlossforall.com/calories-needed.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.weightlossforall.com/calories...</a>|`|0ztnCrm7aa	anything less the n1200 calories is not a good idea. your body will go into starvation mode and you will not lose weight.|`|f05TawR0aa	BAD idea, unless you're trying to gain weight. Aside from being very unhealthy, with this plan what will happen is on day 1 you will kill your metabolism by not eating enough, so that when you eat more one day 2 your body will hold on to every calorie it can find, causing you to gain weight. Alternating calorie intake does work, but it would be better to eat 1300 calories one day and 1500 the next.

You go girl!|`|XpWjdPg2aa	It depends how much you weigh now... and your definition of "eating healthy." But this is a pretty intensive plan! You should come close. Make sure you focus on weights too, especially ab exercises.
xdxa2rjeaa	gain weight thats a first. i know you are going to be like WHAT! but work out you will gain those ten ponds fast and they wont be bad! i promiss this will work. i needed to gain 2 pounds and thats how i did it musle weights a TON! so working out will help. u might lose weight in the begining but after losing it you will gain the musle adn gain those ten pounds you want. also eat healthy there is no reason to do bad to your body just to gain weight or look good. just eat a lot of the heathy food. i wish you the best of luck i really do. and you can do this. if you need more help or some ways to work out and have fun e-mail me.

AG9msdUDaa	The only 'immediate gratification' you get is the pump right after the workout where your muscles are engorged with blood and feel really hard and look really big. It goes away over the next hour or so, but while it's there is feels great. It does take a while of working out over months for this to become a permanent part of your appearance.|`|7yHdoWRFaa	Depends if you have given her a permanent smile on her face...from a male perspective that is.|`|un0gZ7Ybaa	There are small changes that happen every night while sleeping, but it takes time, along with healthy eating habits.|`|JqVU84yLaa	over time any time|`|SHwuzsPyaa	hah no.<br>  <br>  its long term....|`|dhAyZuEXaa	lmao its shows after a long time lol

zLpsu8GBaa	It sounds to me like you are not overweight. But weight, for most of us without higher metabolism, is all about calories in versus calories out.<br>  <br>  Going to the gym is fine, but what exercise are you doing while you are there? In addition, are you varying those exercises. I watch a lot of people come to the gym everyday and they do the same thing over and over again or they walk on the treadmill for 30 minutes. So the question you have to ask yourself are you varying the workouts enough while you are at the gym?<br>  <br>  But say you are burning what an average female burns just being awake, plus what you do at the gym. I would guess that you are somewhere around burning 2500 calories day. If you are ingesting 2400 calories a day, then you are only losing 100 calories a day. Even with a "healthy" diet, at that rate it will take you a month to lose a pound. <br>  <br>  1500 calories is a little low if you start varying your physical activity a lot. But I would minimally cut your calorie intake to 2000 calories and intensify/vary your workouts. Make sure to give your body enough rest as well. The human body is a funny thing and sometimes hangs onto weight it doesn't necessarily needs, but wants, because it thinks its being starved.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|8sfrIoUCaa	okay so to burn 1 pound you have to work off 1200 calories <br>  and going to the gym every single day isnt exactly the best way to work off the weight <br>  and if you do go you should have cardio days and toning up days<br>  every other day <br>  <br>  to loose weight you would have to restrict your caloric intake and burn a stable amount of calories at the gym when you exercise|`|7fbuXvilaa	not really, you should have like 1600 or less calories a day, i have about 1,200 or less a day and im having a hard time loosing weight. I exercise 4 at least 45 cardio minutes|`|W7uP1ty4aa	limit your calories to 1500 max...do about 30 mins on the treadmill 3 times a week, aim to get your heart rate up to 150 and keep it there. You`ll lose 10 lbs in a month. Drink lots of water too (2L a day).|`|67JXdC7Gaa	I think that's great exercising increases endorphins which help with depression which in turn will help you from eating out of anxiety which should help play a role in what your trying to do lose weight!|`|uJKTR4d2aa	it'll take you quite a long time to lose weight eating that much. You can eat nothing but 1500 calories worth of greasy fries and lose weight faster than that. its calories, nutrition just helps it faster, but not if you are eating that much.<br>  <br>  if you want to lose weight eat 1500 calories instead.|`|2RzEaod9aa	While your calories come from healthy sources, a diet where you have to say that you're eating veggies at least every other day means you're not eating a balanced diet. I also don't see other grains you're consuming (oatmeal, rice, quinoa, etc.), or any beans or nuts. Balanced nutrition aids in proper weight loss.<br>  <br>  Working out for 1-2 hours doesn't typically constitute eating 2400 calories, unless you're really, really, really going allllll out, which I doubt you are because you list "if not than only 1 hour." For someone who seriously trains, there is no "if not." There's only, "I do X, Y, and Z no matter what." At 5'7 and being female, I lost about 10lbs per month, and I was eating about 3100-3500 calories each day. You must also understand that I worked out a significant amount each week, 12-17 times each week actually. Lost about 100lbs that way.
pn9q0JkXaa	Walking/jogging is a great way to exercise so yes definitely go out for walks or jog everyday.|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !<br>  <br>  I have answered this question so many times that I now just copy and paste my story !<br>  If you want to loose fat, I suggest eating a well balanced diet.<br>  Grilled or baked lean meats, fruits, fiber, vegetables, water and un - salted nuts. <br>  Exercise 5 days of the week, alternating with cardio and strength training. Do not cross out anything from your " diet", save the 2 days that you do not work out for being able to eat junk foods. You will not over indulge, after 2 weeks of eating a well balanced diet, on the 2 off days you have, you will not want as much junk food. <br>  <br>  I lost 105 pounds in 1 year by eating this this way.|`|CVZhrM0Yaa	The simple way to lose weight is determination. Whatever you do keep at it. Its so easy to lose the will power. Extra water and exercise are they key. Try and walk 5 miles in the first wek then increase it. To get a boost try some of that acai stuff at <a href="http://urlmule.com/?481" rel="nofollow">http://urlmule.com/?481</a>  I lost 20lbs in 3 weeks using it as a supplement to the water and exercise. Keep at it.
aae904677c1c36006959f6255793626eaa	well if your eating right and exersizing,maybe you should have your thyroid checked.|`|9pLI73pqaa	I can give you a web page for the method which is working for me, although I did not begin it in order to lose weight. If you will begin with step # 1, learning to eat balanced and healthy meals including two snacks a day, your body will let go of some of the weight. You should exercise, but due to your back, I suggest you check with your doctor before doing anything that you have not already been approved to do. Be sure to get enough sleep (step # 2) and get off chemicals (step #3) except for any prescriptions you are taking. Exercise is step # 4 and it is doubtful you will need step #5 unless your body is out of line or you are over 50 years old.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
x6uCeQ5Aaa	probably about a half of a mile. Speed three is usually 3mph. So divide 60/3=20 minutes a mile, then divide 8 minutes by 20 minutes and you get .4. Therefore you technically ran 40 tenths of a mile which is equivalent to almost two laps around the track.|`|sYxtPBziaa	What the heck is speed 3.... 3 mph? 3 kmh?<br>  you shouldn't have to run at either of those speeds...|`|c23Unb5daa	not even a mile. for like 3 1/2 it takes about 9 minutes for a mile.|`|tIldpr7vaa	i dunno but if ur trying to lose weight u gotta up that to at least 25mins
swQz4R2Iaa	Dont fool for it. The only supplement that i know helps with weight loss is green tea extract, but honestly they dont know WHY you lose the extra weight.|`|AA10363258	Yeah i have tried them and they don't work :( I've been dieting and excersizing too and thought that they would help but they haven't done anything.
sQu3LLqtaa	A spoonful of peanut butter is supposed to help.|`|GhJ3SB0Eaa	so theres this bitter stuff, not sure excactly what its called, but its liquid ask your mom/dad if you have it.<br>  and then you put that on a lemon, and put sugar on the lemon too. eat the lemon and its like magic! it actually works!|`|BLbNhcwYaa	I hate hiccups just as much as you do.  If you have that kind of patience, just try to tough it out or try other methods of getting rid of them.  Hiccups are just like muscle spasms they can't be detrimental to your health.|`|mAlvOFnWaa	this is going to sound weird but, change your pants/take off your belt. If your diaphram is constricted, like if you ate/drank too much and your wearing pants/a belt that is tight it might be causing your hiccups.
AA10450066	A heart attack pain is a heavy,sharp pain that feels like someone is sitting on your chest that weighs 400lbs. They also have a pain that radiates down the left arm and sometimes around the shoulder blade.In acid reflux it can be a close second, but there isn't the heavy sitting on the chest feeling and usually no radiating pain either. I know that a panic attack definitely feels like a heart attack when you go through it.If you can try and "talk yourself down" by telling yourself that there's nothing wrong and try to keep your mind off of what's physically hurting sometimes it will help bring you out of the attack.I hope you're understanding this.I'm telling you this from experience.Why hasn't your doctor been working with you on the attacks? I know there are medications you can take if you want to.|`|eab67f43c0cff3a2dc3c807267bbd536aa	both have same pain, but MI often has rapid heart rate and low oxygen at resting. Need BP cuff and oximeter to check out.|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	don't think its a heart attack, acid reflux is similar to indigestion, its like acid burning your throat and panic attacks can give pains in chest - take bicarb - 2 teaspoons in half a glass of warm water, that will help if its reflux
a1PcWRQOaa	oh I wish. if you find a way that you can, tell me! haha|`|x6uCeQ5Aaa	Your boobs are usually the first thinks to go when you start working out as they are a source of fat.|`|OLCDyZIVaa	I dont think so , in most cases when people lose that amount of weight that is what goes first.

If you consider your tongue to any of her body parts "sex," then there's one option. Now, aim another part of your body at another girl, and voila... there's two.... Now, should you get a third girl to aim her tongue at another part of your body, then that's three....<br>  <br>  Of course, you could also be putting your fingers into other girls, so there's two more...<br>  <br>  And so on....<br>  <br>  Again though, it depends on your definition...|`|IBshj7fDaa	Eiffel tower.google it|`|H0Xtd7vHaa	If you can keep "up" with them yes|`|sD15UEgeaa	You never heard of a threesome?|`|nZuOG40baa	Yes, depending on your definition of "have sex."|`|CQ4ozjz6aa	yes its called a threesome|`|qJsfBCYEaa	I guess.

You could have valvular heart disease.  Sometimes infection can cause one or more of the valves of the heart to become damaged and malfunction.  Some people with valve problems report that they'll sometimes have sudden sharp pain in their chest, which is attributed to the valve getting stuck for a second and then snapping back into position.<br>  <br>  It could also be related to this recurrent infection that you're talking about.  If I had to guess I would say that it's a chronic bronchitis that you're talking about, which is similar to asthma. That could also be responsible for your symptoms.<br>  <br>  EITHER WAY, I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT YOU HAVE YOUR PARENT[S] TAKE YOU TO YOUR DOCTOR TO LOOK INTO IT.|`|9pLI73pqaa	You need your Mom to get you to a doctor to find out what's going on.

JjbragXNaa	Severe nausea and most likely stomach pain.  If you're going to puke, you'll know.  And don't be afraid of it.  99% of the time it makes you feel better.|`|inST4SlAaa	well if you have ever had the flu you should know<br>  <br>  your mouth will water along with your stomach muscles contracting and believe me, you will know|`|ca45a20110b39435a05dfafc8745bf11aa	I think it varies from person to person. <br>  First off...if you are so afraid of puking, never do anything that may lead to it.....eating too much...drinking too much...smoking too much....<br>  In these cases the early warning signs...for me...are feeling sick and my mouth watering. That's when I think oh-oh and get to the bathroom PDQ.<br>  <br>  If you are unlucky ebough to pick up a bug...then I'm sorry to say that it's every man...or woman....for themselves. Clear the way and take no prisoners. Get a glass of water. Remember to breathe. It's nature's way of taking care of you.|`|9pLI73pqaa	If I have any warning, it is usually a sudden bad taste in my mouth, like the juices flow for no apparent reason.

As well, if you're been coughing very harshly for the past few days that can also do it.<br>  <br>  You'll need a chest X-Ray to confirm. Also, ask for a PPD shot just to be on the safe side.

For example if you were ever at a beach and someone got they may have been told to go in the salt water. That is because it cleanses wounds.

c5ScseTdaa	I'm not sure there's a "normal" weight for any size 13 year old.  You're literally between bodies right now:  your kid body and your adult body.  I was a scrawny kid and I'm a proportional adult, but I was a porker at 13!  It's what some teenage bodies do before settling into their adult curves.<br>  <br>  If your parents will take you to see a doc, ask him about your concerns.  Ask the doc if he (or she) can talk about normal ranges for body fat in your age.  Again, give yourself a little leeway if it's high because you're changing, but worry more about your body fat percentage than your weight.  It's a truer indication of how healthy you are.  Ask the doc about your exercise and eating habits while you're at it.<br>  <br>  Chances are you're fairly average and drink too much sugar, eat too much junk, or watch a little more TV and exercise a little less than you should, but I bet you're not too far off.  Make a couple of reasonable lifestyle changes to be healthier, and get ready to mature into an awesome bod.|`|kvGDCV2gaa	Anywhere between 115-145|`|WiZRMKsGaa	Well, I don't want to give a range, but you're only a year younger than me and I'm just a little under your height and I weigh about 110.

wwP3ONCFaa	Nobody is really sure what causes hiccups. Some scientists believe hiccuping is the last vestige of a primitive reflex that at one time served some useful purpose, but not anymore. What causes it? The explanations are nearly endless, but most experts start their lists of hiccup sins with eating too fast and swallowing too much air. It seems a good place to start.<br>  <br>  Here are a few remedies for hiccups:<br>  Doctor Dubois' surefire sugar cure. One cure that I find effective is a teaspoon of sugar, swallowed dry,That quite often stops the hiccups in minutes. The sugar is probably acting in the mouth to modify the nervous impulses that would otherwise tell the muscles in the diaphragm to contract spasmodically,<br>  <br>  The half-minute hiccup helper. Dawn Horvath can diagnose digestive disturbances with great dexterity. She's a researcher just like Dreisbach, and that profession seems to know no end of alimentary ailments.<br>  <br>  Half-minute hiccup helper goes like this: Fill a Dixie cup with water and place it on the counter, then press your index finger in your ears. Bend over at the waist and pick up the cup with the pinky finger and thumb of each hand and, while holding your breath, drink the water down in one or two gulps.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Paperbag. It's in the technique,You have to blow in and out exactly ten times, and you have to do it really hard until you're red in the face. You also have to do it fast, and you have to form a good seal around your mouth with the bag so that no air gets in. If you follow those directions exactly, the bag will work every time.|`|AA11482488	The best way to cure hiccups is to take a deep breath and hold it as long as you can.  Your diaphram has contracted and needs to expand and relax, holding your breath is the best way to do that.<br>  <br>  All the home remedies are designed to do this but just holding your breath is the easiest way.|`|7wLup9pKaa	I believe it's a muscle spasm...sort of like when your eye twitches for no reason....and I don't think they can be prevented.<br>  <br>  as far a cures- holding my breath for like 10 seconds always works for me. I have heard of people hanging upside down (like off the side of your bed), spoonful of sugar (this is useful for babies- not sure about adults).|`|x6LUKNwvaa	Whenever I get hiccups i get a teaspoon of vinegar and put the vinegar to the back of my throat and then swallow it.<br>  <br>  Im not sure how that works but it seems work for me really well, although its not everyones cup of tea|`|50ca49acd54c91d903d473e093ea2d38aa	Everybody knows that the hiccups are caused by an abnormal spasm of the diaphram. The only remedy that works for me is to hold my breath, and while doing so, take a large drink of water.

833a435e36344342d10e69454b7e6731aa	some people just don't feel the burn... but the burn is when you tear your muscles. they build up while you are RESTING, not lifting, contrary to what a lot of people think. they repair themselves stronger, and that's where they get stronger. one trick to kickstart your muscles is to try really heavy weights and small reps once a week, just to get your muscles a little active, and then continue your normal workout for the rest of the week. but be careful to not workout when they are sore/burning, because they are already torn then and you don't want to tear them more. if you workout too much, your muscles can actually start breaking down.|`|POA493NBaa	your muscle's might be used to that weight maybe you should go up some rep's. You might be strong CONGRATS|`|x3EPqezJaa	You're not lifting enough. You need to lift heavier things, and maybe lower the reps.  Raising the weight and lowering the reps will help your muscles to increase in strength.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Find the right weight that allows you to complete all sets and reps... go heavier to feel the burn; do 3 sets, 10-12 reps|`|Wm3GDO9jaa	First of all, 20 reps is too much for one time. Depending on how much weight you were using will determine if you'll "feel the burn". Use an amount of weight that you know will be difficult for you, and just do less reps. For example, for me I use a twelve pound weight and do 8 reps at a time. I do it maybe 3 or 4 times. I feel the burn. You don't want to use a weight that is really difficult. You might find that you a weight that isn't as heavy can be just as effective than one you can't lift. <br>  <br>  And yes, I'm a girl. But trust me, I know all about this.|`|Gsqt4ODYaa	You feel the burn when you are building muscle, when the lactic acid is burning.<br>  <br>  You build muscle when your body has been challenged.<br>  <br>  Your body has not been challenged, you need to challenge it.<br>  <br>  You're doing bicep curls?  Try 21's as a warm-up.<br>  <br>  Example: <br>  When I curl, I take a curl bar, and have 85 pounds on total.  Then, I start all the way down, and go halfway up 7 times.  Then, I fully curl it to where the weight is resting around my neck, and I go halfway down 7 times.  After those, I go all the way up and down 7 times.  (Sometimes I'll go to 10, but then it's not the 21 gun salute)<br>  <br>  Then, I change it to free weights, and start isolation curls with 40 pounds in each arm, for around a set of 10.  Then, for a 3rd set, I try to hit 45 pounds about 6 times.<br>  <br>  If you are trying to go for TONE, you still can't be doing 40 reps, that's not really going to do anything.  You should do a weight you find challenging, that you can barely get up 15 times.  Then, work your way from that 15 to 25.  As soon as you can do that 25 it'd be a good idea to move up a little weight though.  I consider anything higher than 10 high reps, and anything lower than 10 low reps.  For building tone, you want to do low weight high reps, for building mass you want to do high weight low reps.<br>  <br>  Good luck, remember to challenge yourself.|`|BWfwX0NDaa	okay, bro if you can do 20 reps of one weight, YOU NEED TO ADD WEIGHT<br>  <br>  <br>  if you are doing 25lb 20x then you need to go to 35 or 45 and try to reach 6x (not 20x) everytime<br>  <br>  and it should be tough, your body should be twitching around but you keep it still<br>  <br>  you will feel the burn the next day<br>  <br>  trust me|`|CXwjdUgDaa	if u want to feel a burn do heavy weight with about 8-12 reps

I would go with the 28th, personally.  Keep every other months' celebration on the 29th (although many people stop with the monthly celebrations after the 1 year mark).

CuVnpxh3aa	Depends on what condition I need a Dr for. If I need to be manipulated because everything is out of place and I am having backaches and such I would want to see a D.O. and I do go to a D.O. from time to time because they can also treat medical problems. If I am having a medical condition that a D.O. does not treat or will have to be hospitalized for or have surgery for then I want an MD. because D.O. cannot treat in most hospitals where I live. There is only so much a D.O. learns in medical school but an MD learns a little bit of everything in medical school.

"I have to eat less than everyone here." "I can't eat in public."<br>  Often Anorexia will start out with a list of off limits foods, it will then degenerate into a "safe list" of a handful of foods that one can eat.

People who have anorexia have an intense fear of gaining weight. They severely limit the amount of food they eat and can become dangerously thin.<br>  <br>  Anorexia affects both the body and the mind. It may start as dieting, but it gets out of control. You think about food, dieting, and weight all the time. You have a distorted body image. Other people say you are too thin, but when you look in the mirror, you see a fat person.<br>  <br>  Anorexia usually starts in the teen years. Early treatment can be very effective. But, if not treated early, anorexia can become a lifelong problem. Untreated anorexia can lead to starvation and serious health problems, such as bone thinning (osteoporosis), kidney damage, and heart problems. Some people die from these problems.<br>  <br>  If you or someone you know has anorexia, get help right away. The longer this problem goes on, the harder it is to overcome. With treatment, a person with anorexia can feel better and stay at a healthy weight.

Do you REALLY believe everything you read??!!|`|b0z8t7nYaa	your not gonna get worms|`|RTHWQvkzaa	Um I don't think its true. Personally, I would say you can wear it two days in a rwo, and then change it. If you have to you can go three. I don't think anything would happen fi you even went four, but that might just be kind of disgusting cause everyone sweats. Just saying.<br>  <br>  It will eventually get sweaty, though. :-)|`|vD0Nkjvfaa	no i wear the same bra every other day, like for example, i have two bras (this is an example, i have more) a white one and a red one, i wear the white one monday, red one tuesday, white one wednesday, red one thursday, and a new yellow one on friday.|`|y5WPZ8dJaa	It's completely fine!

5QRIWopSaa	You shouldn't eat anything 3 hours before going to sleep. Trying to sleep, while making your body work to digest at the same time is going to confuse your body, and you'll wake up tired. <br>  I think it's always good when people add more natural foods to their diets, but eating high-acid foods before bed will aggrevate your stomach, and probably keep you awake.   But do NOT eat, and then take an antiacid (like Tums) just to get to sleep. Your body needs that acid to keep parasites from entering your system, and making you sick, If your stomach hurts, it's best just to suck it up, or you could cause more serious problems in your bowels.|`|puEjSoDfaa	You shouldn't eat anything within 3 hours of when you are going to bed, because your body can't digest the food correctly and it turns into weight gain|`|7xeC7FLIaa	just eat before an hour to sleep ok its good and it balances|`|1iiWQLfqaa	i dunno:(|`|F9Ll7oLJaa	No fruits are not eaten at night|`|0ab6fc7bd98309110aaef7ff59e4615caa	No, I dont think so but you would need to eat dinner with a lot of veggies.  The best thing to do not to eat after 8pm.  If you eat before you go to bed and it will sit the foods in your stomach to make you gain the weight or store in fat.

You should be eating AT LEAST your basal metabolic rate, which is how many calories your body needs to run your basic metabolic functions.

pjYQhPPBaa	That's an interesting question. I don't know the answer for sure, but if you look on the can, it should say what a serving size consists of. For example, does a serving say how many pieces of fruit, or how many oz are in a serving? That's the best way to tell.<br>  <br>  I hate to tell you this, but I don't think you're going to lose much weight from eating canned fruit. The juice is literally almost pure sugar. (Don't believe me? Check the ingredients, no doubt the main ingredients are high fructose corn syrup and sucrose, which are unnatural sweeteners). Even if you don't drink the juice, the fruit has been stored in it, and soaked up all the juice. That's like saying fried vegetables are good for you because you're at least eating vegetables.<br>  <br>  If you want to get the most health benefit, you should just eat fresh or frozen foods, nothing canned. Frozen fruits are actually known to be slightly healthier than fresh because they're frozen as soon as they're picked, rather than being picked, transported, and being left in the light and air where they'll lose their nutrients.|`|g8pRhElsaa	I'm sure the calories are included...I mean, the juice comes out of the fruit, so I bet you can drink it without adding calories to your count.|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	yes|`|mh0QRDE9aa	I am sure if you read the side of the can of fruit, if that is what you are eating, it will give the calorie count.  It also includes the sugar that may have been added. If you are eating fresh fruit, the juice is taken into account as you know.   Yes, there is a lot of spam on this forum.  Everyone needs to do their fair share and report it.  But unfortunately, only few do. So we are stuck with it.|`|ySB6dZYlaa	I never thought about that... but I guess that it does include it.

I have a chemical imbalance that I got through heredity and I have so many pets but most of the time they don't seem to make me happy. I have 2 cockatiels, 1 panda hamster, 2 dogs (One's an Australian Blue Heeler and the other one is a Golden Retriever/Yellow Lab mix), and 4 cats (Three of them I am unsure of but the last one is an Orange Tabby). They do make me happy if I am depressed due to depressing things (like a break-up), because they're so darned cute, but not when I am depressed due to the chemical imbalance.|`|wn5HWdzGaa	I have a Peakapoo (1/2 peakanease,1/2 toy poodle).

jNm1eIzBaa	I've been through the decades of health problems myself and at times I let myself get down to the point that could be called depression. One thing keeps me going, it changes my attitude, and even helps me control my health. I have a daughter who I really feel needs me right now in her life. It might not always be that way but right now she needs me and I plan on being here for her. My answer is since you are older maybe you need to let your Dad know that you still need him around. Let him know how important he is to you. Then wait and see what happens. I hope things work out..|`|v4Wi0OJgaa	Give him a viagra. :)|`|b09a95122fd9bc36dd862d2d74cf004faa	Constant pain really wears you down after a while, so one thing to do is make sure this is being treated properly. If he is depressed, is he taking his meds like he should?<br>  <br>  Another thought is that socializing can be helpful. Does he have friends that he can spend time with occasionally? Some people respond to animals -if your dad is a dog lover, do you have a friend with a nice, well-behaved dog who wouldn't mind you having the dog over occasionally (if your dad likes animals)?<br>  <br>  Is his psychiatrist aware of the situation? I'd talk to him about what to do. If the current psychiatrist isn't working out, you might consider finding a new one.|`|29a2wm7Eaa	Your dad needs to talk to his doctor about this.  Depression is a very serious condition but it can be easily treated.  His doctor can give him a test for it.  It may help you in your talk with him that one in five people will get help for depression in their lives...imagine how many suffer without getting help.  Also, it is not something he is likely to be able to pull himself out of on his own.<br>  <br>  He needs to talk to his doctor.

uXP1Xij4aa	the best exercises for losing fat are cardiovascular exercises, that's running, biking, swimming.<br>  So from all you listed, jogging on the spot would be ok, but you need to do it continuously at 65 - 75 % of your maximum heart rate, for 30 - 40 minutes. <br>  Or you can split it and do it 2 times per day, 20 minutes each.|`|w6QXlMP1aa	google "HIIT" for brilliant fat burning routines.  <br>  <br>  its not nice, its painful, it may make you throw up but christ it works!|`|vIHClDFNaa	The best way to burn fat is to consume less food and exercise more often, the problems appear when we actually try to put that into practice!

If you like bread and pasta, try going whole grain first.  Don't add butter, try marinara for dipping and coating That pasta.  Eat with some brightly colored veggies and remember to eat an apple every day.  A tart one has less sugar.  And chances are you have a friend of a friend who has a trampoline.  Ask if you can use it.  it's great exercise! or get a small personal trampolien to use at home.

Do not cross out anything from your " diet", save the 2 days that you do not work out for being able to eat junk foods. You will not over indulge, after 2 weeks of eating a well balanced diet, on the 2 off days you have, you will not want as much junk food. <br>  <br>  I lost 105 pounds in 1 year by eating this this way.

y4SUDnpaaa	I have read some of your other questions. In one your dilemma was leaving your addict mother who lived on the beach in a nice house and  where you had lots of friends. Your dad also had a nice house and cared more about your grades but lived in a area you thouth was boring. Since your mother's drug problem has escalated causing you to make a suicide attempt, lose your crush, skip  school, and put   you into a deep depression. Surely suffering through all that is not worth the price of living at the beach. If you think your mother ruined your relationship with your crush aren't you afraid she'll make you lose your other friends and you're having a hard time trying to act normal at  school. You even say you hate your mother. Is there any logical reason to continue to live with her and not move to your dad's house? I bet you aren't able to enjoy the beach with all this strive and stress in your life and.  You are living   in an enviroment that has driven you to suicide........that alone should persuade you.  Of course there will be an adjustment period when you move but I think being physically removed from your mother's influence will immediately make your life better. If it's a tough choice for you because you think you should stay and help your mother, you don't. Until your mother, of her own choice, decides to get help you are not even dealing with the mother you love, you are dealing with what the drugs have made her. Please go live with your dad. You're only 13 years old just beginning to form who you will be. Don't let your mother be your role model for women. I hope and pray you go to your dad's. I also think you should talk to your father about what the situation was like and how it affected you and ask to see a professional counselor or therapist to put things in the proper prespective. You've been through an immense amount of trauma, baby girl.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Please tell all that to the school nurse, counselor, or a trusted teacher.<br>  You need more one-on- one help than we can give you here.|`|KyocDVuZaa	Don't listen to those people honestly they know nothing, first of all its your choice think about yourself not your mum im in the same position at the moment i want to move out and be happy but i dont want to leave my mum but i figured i cant just ruin my life for her i have to sort out my own problems just think about it.

I think you should talk to someone else, someone you can trust--also you should be able to find help at school, but if you don't feel comfortable talking to them, you could also find support for depression online: <br>  <br>  This is a depression support group from WebMD, where you can talk to others and you can seek help:<br>  <a href="http://boards.webmd.com/webx?50@@.5987f419" rel="nofollow">http://boards.webmd.com/webx?50@@.5987f4...</a><br>  <br>  I would also suggest talking to someone at school--a counselor perhaps and seeing if you could talk to a psychologist.  Maybe living iwth your Dad is a good idea, you can't deal with all of this alone and you are not responsible for your Mom-- your Mom is responsible for herself and she is an adult.  Please don't take her problems on as yours, they're not, you deserve a happy and healthy and supportive relationship with your parents and if you can't get htat from your Mom you have every right to get that from your Dad.<br>  <br>  For overview on other depression issues:<br>  <a href="http://www.findingdulcinea.com/guides/Health/Anxiety-and-Depression.pg_05.html#05" rel="nofollow">http://www.findingdulcinea.com/guides/He...</a><br>  <br>  As far as your crush is concerned, crushes come and go and right now it seems liek they are everything, but truly I promise you in a year you will totally forget them or wont' know why you liked them.

Maybe talk with a psychologist.. see if your sadness is anything serious. <br>  Stay strong and think about the future okay?<br>  Good luck|`|tqhr4V33aa	please try to call a suicide hotline or talk to your school counselor..  You shoul go live with your dad.  being with your mom right now is not good for you.. you will be able to see her again and maybe not seeing her for a while would be a good thing.. I dont think that when people take their lives they destroy everyone they left behind..please get some help..
AA10309738	Hi Emma,<br>  <br>  Your weight naturally fluctuates by about 1 KG throughtout the day for things like a full stomach and bowels! But not by 3.2 KG. Are you sure you were 76.2 2 weeks ago? I don't think it's possible unless you were trying

We need to understand 3 definitions: the volume of calories in our food, the volume of calories a specific physical action uses up each hour, and finally our own personal daily allowance of calories. The sole method which really showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials remaining, it has been reported in Fox News and USA Today.

9pLdhuBnaa	No, not that I am aware of.  However, I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.<br>  <br>  In the mean time here's the link to a site that may help you find more information.

LaJn6jxJaa	This is a tough one.  It sounds like she's manipulating you a little bit without realizing it.  Cutting the filters isn't that big of a deal, but I can see where it would get frustrating when a person is addicted.  I think that you should just continue to apologize, but explain to her that you did as a way of taking your anger out on something else, not her.  An abusive person wouldn't do that.  Most boys don't take out their anger by yelling or crying, they like to express it in a physical way, which is why some get abusive.  If you keep doing things like cutting the filters off her cigarettes, it wouldn't be a horrible thing, but try to learn (for her) to discuss your problems no matter what situation you and her are in.
S6MngduLaa	I think they feed off each other for sure, but ultimately the decisions you make are your own, so yes, it is just you, because even the disorder itself is... just you. <br>  I have bipolar and I used to be a nicotine/marijuana addict and generally didn't treat my body well and have since found that the best cures to this disorder are KNOWING yourself... what sends you flying up and down and all around. The higher you get, the lower you get yea? After time though of staying even everything slowly goes up. Keep yourself rested, eat well, do things you love to do and mostly BELIEVE in yourself! Nothing can hold you back, you are god of your reality. <br>  Don't let it hold you back. You can still do what you want. In fact, I have found ways to channel my mania into super productivity and creativity.... and this production keeps me from falling into real deep depressions. Learn yourself. <br>  Last note, all personal preference, but I have found that the use of psychedelics has been an integral force in helping me overcome this, namely Psilocybin mushrooms in a quiet, peaceful place where I can do what I love ... I tend to meditate, self reflect, make music. It can be  extremely empowering!<br>  Good luck|`|iByp9i2Naa	I'm bipolar and I can definitely believe it contributes to this type of personality.  I think that if you find something that relaxes you, gets you high, or just makes you feel good in general, you will want to keep doing it.  It's a normal part of coping.  You keep doing the same things over and over again because you know the outcome and how they make you feel.|`|mX5TVUKgaa	Yes along with Personality problems does come substance abuse and the worst part is that you will find u have a lot of physical and emotional dependence when u try and back out.

It's all about money - for "women's beauty" manufacturers and their advertizers now, just as much as for porn profiteers.<br>  <br>  People have been watching those, and they're coming to believe that a bald vulva is "normal".<br>  <br>  It isn't... except on a little girl.<br>  <br>  OK, I've had my little rant, but you may want to shave anyhow for whatever personal reasons you have - and those are none of my business - so I don't think it's fair for me to tell you "Just Say No" and expect you to go against your own wishes: it doesn't work with drugs and it can't work any better for anything else people want to do.<br>  <br>  If you're going to shave, you should do it properly so you'll get the best possible look and feel out of it and minimize the razor, skin and hair problems that can happen.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.velvetdragon.com/etc/shave.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.velvetdragon.com/etc/shave.ht...</a> is a really good and very thorough how-to guide to shaving any and all body hair, and I highly recommend it.<br>  <br>  Best of luck with your choice, whatever it is, and I hope I've helped.  :-)|`|7iIh5QmOaa	that is your choice and your choice only. talk with him and see what he likes. although i have found most men like shaved. me i shave but that was my preference not his. but something like this you should discuss with you partner. but either way im sure he likes you with or with out the hair. although doctors will tell you the reason for hair there is to help protect from infections and stuff.|`|AA10714546	most guys like shaved so you prolly should but its up too you..<br>  you could ask him what he likes if not then to be ave i would but you could get razor burn sooo it might look bad for first start|`|CpevWaQ7aa	Yeah why not|`|Kx9QgyjSaa	Do you want to?

Push for the CT. If your not happy, say so.
o37i9Nazaa	Yeah I think the same. People moan about who they are and what they look like but youve got to remember you are what you make you are.

Once the weight comes off, the diabetes, acid reflux, sleep apnea, high blood pressure and arthritis often resolve themself.  The patient is on less medication and is "healthier".<br>  <br>  These surgeries are only about 50% successful for long term weight loss.   Most of the time the patient/person finds ways to get the calories in even though their stomach is smaller in size.  (They drink milk shakes, high calorie liquids, graze all day on small portions constantly keeping their little stomach pouch full.)  Many times they do not incorporate a regimen of regular exercise either.<br>  <br>  As far as the loose skin, the bariatric patient (those who undergo gastric bypass and lap banding procedures) will inevitably have this and no amount of exercise will snap this stretched loose skin back into shape.  It is very common for many bariatic patient to have their loose skin removed.  Loose skin in never a good idea because it can get pinched/injured and also grow yeast infections between the folds.<br>  <br>  Some people, as PET (positron emission topography) scans demonstrate show highlighted areas in the brain when people have addictions to substances.  For many of these obese people, these areas in the brain light up in PET scans when they think of food, just like those who are addicted to methamphetamines, cocaine, heroin and the like.  There is a surge of dopamine released generally when any addict consumes their "drug".  The addicted person needs a greater amount of that substance because they have less dopamine receptors, thus they need more drug to get more of a response.<br>  <br>  Anyone who has an addiction to a drug, whether it be what we consider the usual array of drugs, or food for the morbidly obese, usually has psychological issues as well.  Many times people try to quell their disturbing thoughts or feelings with food (and drugs) to get the calming affect from the nuerochemical release from the brain.<br>  <br>  The US is also not a good example of health.  We supersize EVERYTHING!  We have cut PE (physical exercise) from the vast majority of schools because of lack of funding, the belief that exercise is a waste of time and to use that time to improve school's testing scores.  We have convenience stores throughout the nation so that people don't have to go without cola, candy, beer and chips for any length of time.  Mothers often give their children baby bottles full of soda to keep the child from crying and because formula takes time/effort to prepare AND often costs more.  We (the US) are a nation of obese peoples -- the world is growing in the ways of the US as we spread our global influence.  <br>  <br>  Scoffing at people who are attempting to lose weight through surgical means is not a helpful answer.  Our system has quite a bit of play into the role of escalating morbid obesity.  Performing gastric bypass/lap bands are also big business -- great money makers.  <br>  <br>  We are being placated by "bread and circuses" . . . I digress.  I have included an article on bread and circuses.  Enjoy at your leisure.  = )|`|bCmqScVlaa	You should commend people for trying to get their lives back through gastric bypass.  Your comments show you know nothing about obesity.  These surgeries saves insurance companies millions in the long run.  All the medical problems that come with obesity cost the insurance companies much more than this one surgery.  It actually cures diabetes in many people.  Do you have a clue as to how much money is spent on a single person who is a diabetic in their lifetime with dialysis, kidney failure, amputations, insulin and all the testing supplies, etc.  It just goes on and on and this is just one example of what this surgery will correct.  <br>  <br>  Not only that, this surgery saves lives and gives people a much happier life to live. A morbidly obese mother can now play sports with her children once she loses the weight.  A father can now coach a little league team once he gets healthy enough. Diabetes won't ruin their health by the time they are 50.  They can look forward to being healthy and active for the rest of their lives.  This surgery seems to be one of the most successful ways of helping the morbidly obese. Unless you walked a mile in someone else's shoes, don't judge them honey.  <br>  <br>  So what if one girl lied about her not having surgery.  Does that really matter as long as she is now able to be active and live like a normal person without all the extra weight?  Are you really mean enough to resent something so stupid?  Talk about being shallow!!!  <br>  <br>  You  say, "People fail to realize that it takes a long time to gain all that weight and less time to lose it."  Where do you get your facts from?  I take it you never went to Harvard or any college for that matter.  Taking off the weight is not usually the problem sweetie pie.  Keeping the weight off is the real issue here.  And that extra saggy skin would never firm up no matter how much exercise and dieting a person does.  It's been stretched and lost its elasticity to return to what it once was.  The only way to get rid of it is to surgically remove it.  <br>  <br>  I don't agree with your comments at all.  I think they are stupid and mean spirited.  Your lack of education on the subject is very apparent.  Shame on you for resenting people who have serious health problems trying to make themselves better and take control of their lives.  Whatever method they use is OK with me.  I say good luck to them and God Bless.|`|x3EPqezJaa	No, I just get mad at judgmental, whiny people like you who like punishing people for their physical ailments. No one is born with Alzheimer's disease, either, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't treat it. And drug addicts and alcoholics might have made themselves that way, but I feel much better in a society that will help them to get into recovery than a society that has them running amok. And you're dead wrong about the skin--skin doesn't "shrink on its own." It doesn't get baggy because you lost weight quickly. It does that because it has a limit to how quickly it shrinks, and that's dependent on age and genetics. If it just shrank on its own, you wouldn't get old people with saggy jowls and wrinkles. Learn a bit about biology before you post rants.

But for the most part the pill that most people are taking to help with ance and cramping it can take from one month to two months to fully take effect..<br>  If you find by the second month that it is not working, get to the doctor and see if there is something else you can take with it to help, or a different type of pill. <br>  I hope that this helps.|`|HWeajklaaa	It took my sister about a month or so to start seeing a difference|`|6UWFGdy3aa	i take birth control for acne and sevre cramps. its amazing it only took a month or my skin to clear completelt and now i even feel better in general.|`|Oxf5kEjuaa	that's pretty dumb you know, you should get of birth control a.s.a.p. look it up kid.
Dnr0Wbn3aa	I think its dangerous to train to eat more. So I wouldn't do it, because I love myself. But, I think what you would have to do is, eat small items, like a hot dog, and then wait 5 minutes. Then repeat. And repeat. Try not to drink anything until the end just to wash everything down, because if you get filled up on liquid, you're going to get stuffed too fast.<br>  <br>  Just be careful, and don't try to train to eat more just to get your moneys worth.

DO go, wholesome things, read good book,s listen to good music, go to church, join a service group.<br>  <br>  If you "think" you "had " depression, that's most likely not your problem, you might be a little obsessive compulsive.

Like if you cut and you cut to deep and you bleed out, or you hang yourself or something like that. <br>  Depression is a very harmful thing though, because it messes with your judgment.

There is probably nothing medically wrong with you, but you may have some psychological issues going on.  I know people always tell kids to talk to someone, but you don't always want to do it - you could always leave a note in your guidance counselor's mailbox at school telling her how you feel (don't sign it if you don't want to) and ask her to talk to your class about what to do if you have depression problems - then you would get information, but nobody would know it was actually for you!<br>  Try to get some help though - there are lots of great things that could help you - some people are just depressed in the winter and can get a small sun lamp for their house - it's proven to help...if that's what your problem is.

It would be kinder for her if you broke up with her than for her to have to endure your laughing at her. <br>  If you really do care for her, treat her like a princess.

If you think that she has a problem with weight, then you need to support her and be an active part in helping her.  Offer to make something healthy for dinner.  Suggest that the two of you join a gym or exercise together.  Go for a walk on a nice day.  Don't laugh at her or tell her she's fat.  If you truly have concerns for her health, then let her know that.  However, be encouraging and always be on her side.  If you continue to laugh at her, she will be your ex-girlfriend.
tBF9VfPqaa	We have a lot of patients that either break or lose their Hawley retainer. It is very common! <br>  <br>  I would just let them know sooner than later because it could get more expensive depending if your teeth move or not. <br>  <br>  Your orthodontist may ask how you broke it and how long ago. If you were playing with it then they may just advise you on being a little more careful. Sometimes depending on how long you have had it the metal parts just kind of wear out. <br>  <br>  Like I said, we all see lost or broken retainers on a daily basis. I would just call your orthodontist soon and get in to get it fixed or a new one. The longer you wait the more it will usually cost.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!!!
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	It is probably an ingrown hair or stopped up gland. If it is sore, keep it really clean, don't squeeze it, as you can spread the infection inside. In a few days it may form a head, put warm wet cloths on it to help draw out the infection and try to let it come open on its own. Sometimes it helps to sit in a warm bath to get it to come open. When it opens, get the infection to drain out, keep it really clean or you could get a staff infection. It should get completely well in a week after it opens. <br>  <br>  hope this helps..|`|2JO6vsmXaa	if it's a bump you need to pop it and the hair will come out you .. just pop it until you see liquid come out|`|vKjykTRWaa	not to be mean, but what does ingrown hair mean?

xnZi0i8saa	It sounds very much like you are experiencing mixed episodes. That's where you are both manic and depressed at the same time. It can be frustrating and confusing. When I was first diagnosed years ago, I too felt alone and lonely. See your doctor about the mixed episodes, maybe you need a change in meds, some do not work very well for being mixed. And check NAMI for a support group in your area, it will help tremendously with feeling alone. It is hard because even if yoru family is supportive they still cannot know what it is like for you. <br>  <br>  It is very common to be more depressed in the winter, or even on cold cloudy days. A "light box" will help with this and your insurance may even pay for it. <br>  <br>  It is all very normal if you have bipolar. See your doc though, your meds need to be changed. Bipolar or not you should not have to suffer as you are.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|spXPpyP0aa	ya its normal i have the same problem|`|ngZ4edyjaa	having a girlfriend will just complicate things and be a burden in the end of the day.|`|BT5otMrxaa	Every bi-polar person is different.  Also seasons effect your mood.  when it's winter for all people you become more depressed and less cheerful.  People thrive off of sunlight.  So try to get some sun everyday.  It is also normal to want human contact and be connected and want someone to understand you. That's not just a bipolar trait.  That a human trait.   If your not in therapy I would recommend seeing a therapist regularly this way you can talk out how you feel abandoned by your family and about other issues. You could also bring in family member into you sessions and explain to them in a safe non hostile way how to support you and understand your disease.  Most people don't understand mental illness.  They think you just need a week and it will go away like a cold.  Mental illness doesn't go away it's a disease like diabetes.  It's life long and you always have to watch it and make sure you stay healthy and make wise choices with you life or you can get very sick.|`|yUkFvtudaa	I get the same way.  Been diagnosed with major depression, bi-polar, suicidal episodes, panic attacks.  The winter months are very hard.  My family doesn't understand so I have somewhat distanced myself from them.  They say to just not feel that way or get over it.  Meds haven't worked...have been on MANY different ones.  I am married to a wonderful guy that has learned to somewhat help when I am going through an episode.  But he doesn't understand fully and never will.  I have done therapy, but didn't get any relief.  In the winter I find myself closed off from the world and my house is very dark (shades pulled).  I feel more comfortable that way.  Even being with someone who I love deeply and I know loves me deeply, I still feel lost and lonely.  I know he would do anything for me, but those feeling just don't "go away".  I don't know what the answer is.  Most people don't understand mental illness because it's not like a broken leg or something you can see.  And some just don't want to believe you could have those thoughts.  It's easier to ignore it and pretend everything is ok.  Try to talk to a professional.  It may not "solve" everything, but it may help how you approach your illness.

This could cause an additional infection and delay the healing process. <br>  Apply a local anaesthetic ointment, e.g. Lignagel 2 % or lidocaine 5% ointment (this used to be called lignocaine). These may be used on genital or facial sores. If you need a stronger anaesthetic try Xylocaine 10% spray. Dab on (or spray on) as required to relieve pain, especially before urinating - see below. (These are all available from a pharmacy without a prescription.) Occasionally lignocaine/xylocaine can cause hypersensitivity. If it makes your skin more sore, stop using it and your skin will return to normal. <br>  Keep the sores moist, e.g. apply petroleum jelly/Vaseline. <br>  Keep the area clean: washing gently once a day is sufficient. Many people have found a warm salt water solution (1 teaspoon to 1 pint water) very soothing. Gently bathe the area using cotton wool. <br>  Avoid scented soap and deodorants. It is best not to use wipes, gel or soap in this area, but if you do, use an unscented brand. <br>  Avoid over-washing as this can increase irritation and delay healing. <br>  Dab dry carefully with a tissue after washing or use a hair dryer set at 'cold'. <br>  To reduce itching, keep the area as cool as is practical: try an ice pack well-wrapped in cloth for as long as you like (90 minutes). DO NOT put ice directly on the skin. <br>  Women who experience pain when peeing during a first episode can try peeing while in the bath or shower, or sitting on the edge of the bath and pouring water over the area. This will dilute the urine and ease discomfort. Or pee through a tube or into a bottle to prevent urine coming into contact with the sores. You can put lignocaine/lidocaine BP ointment on the area about 15 minutes before urinating to anaesthetize the area, or use petroleum jelly/Vaseline or Orabase on the sore as a barrier.<br>  Remember your doctor can prescribe anti-viral medication if having an outbreak or you feel one coming on it will reduce the time and it can be taken daily to suppress the virus|`|y2nC8BUGaa	First - GO TO A DOCTOR<br>  They could answer any questions for you and help you more than we can.<br>  <br>  But yes you can still give it to someone else when you're not broken out.|`|fAFXkikAaa	Good for you for wanting to know more.  I'll try to summarize a few things for you, but my first suggestion is that you read up on genital herpes from a RELIABLE SOURCE, which would not be Y!A, unfortunately.   My fave website is listed below.<br>  <br>  I'm going to assume that you have genital herpes, not oral herpes, since you asked about pregnancy.   <br>  <br>  Yes, you can pass genital herpes even when no symptoms are present.  It is less lkely, but still possible.<br>  <br>  Yes, you can have kids.  I don't know if you are male or female, but know that herpes won't harm a fetus.    The only danger is during the birth, and there are ways to ensure that the baby is healthy.<br>  <br>  Condoms don't protect against herpes.   They are great for other things, but not herpes.   So if you are a man, getting a woman pregnant won't a problem.<br>  <br>  The only thing PROVEN to improve herpes symptoms is antiviral drugs,although many people report success with things like l-lysine.   Staying healthy in general will also keep outbreaks to a minimum.<br>  <br>  Finally, please know that ethically, it is important that you tell ALL future lovers about your herpes BEFORE you have sex with them.   If you will be putting them at risk (and you will - since condoms don't protect against herpes) they deserve to know.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to hear about your diagnosis.   Good luck.|`|nF0Eaa2Gaa	There is NO CURE for herpes but your body can keep it dormant under a strong immune system. You can still pass it to your sex partners even without outbreaks. If you have an active outbreak on your lips and give oral you will give some one genital herpes and vice versa. <br>  <br>  It is an opportunistic virus which means once your immune system is down or fighting another infection this presents the perfect opportunity for an outbreak. So keep your immune system up and check out the site below for more insight. <br>  <br>  You'll need to tell each of your sex partners about your condition as this is a life long ailment. Good luck!
I8lFqyyFaa	Obviously it's embarrassing, but have you considered perhaps your co-worker was informed in a bid that she have patience if she encountered it, so that she'd know about your broken pipe issue and not write off BO that others thought was decidedly apparent to your terrible hygiene and general lack of appeal, rather than an actual problem you were experiencing that would eventually be addressed?  People sometimes have motives better than those we ascribe to them.  And your coworker may have just been being polite to your face, knowing the difficulty of your situation and the embarrassment you must have been experiencing.  BO in the workplace is a concern to every employee that has to work with you and it sounds like they were making an effort to accommodate your personal catastrophe.  So you really want to sue them for it?

I had it done in 1996 and I don't avoid anything really. I do find though that if I eat a lot of salads, that results in a bit of diarrhea.  Otherwise, you can always just eat what you normally did before and if you experience any diarrhea or stomach upset that didn't happen before then you'll know to avoid those foods.|`|fGE7hL12aa	If you have your gallbladder removed, I don't think you have restrictions.|`|ICLekd2Vaa	so you divorced the husband? so quickly too??? lmfao|`|IKakoOfyaa	About two out of 10 people (20 percent) will have diarrhea after having their gallbladder removed.

It enhances orgasm for the Yang-type (strong) body, but weakens erection or causes premature ejaculation for the Yin-type (weak) body.<br>  When I was young and strong, caffine enhanced my orgasm and performance. However, when I entered midlife and experienced a weak endocrine function, caffine weakened my erection and elevated my blood pressure by turning on the sympathetic function (the alpha adrenergic receptors in the andrenal mudella)."

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL.

When I was dieting (and believe me I still watch my weight even though I have achieved my weight loss goals for the most part) I realized right off that the most important thing is to control your appetite.  If your stomach's not always growling and your not always craving food it is sooo much easier to stick to your guns and stay on your diet.  With hoodia I would literally go a whole day sometimes and simply forget to eat and I didn't get tired and run down like diets can sometimes make you feel.  Once my appetite was under control and I wasn't always thinking about eating then and only then could the weight start coming off consistently and steadily because the hoodia kept my mind off of food and I would go longer on my diet and as I did that naturally I lost weight.  You have to remember that consistency is very important when losing weight.  If you cut back a little on your food consumption everyday your body will change (stomach will shrink and you won't be eating as much) and with that consistency over a few days, weeks and months you will lose weight just like I did.  Hoodia was my saving grace for all of these factors.  Hope this helps!!!|`|ZxgfZBLMaa	It is possible to lose weight rapidly but you should be realistic and take on board that if you lose weight rapidly then you will probably put it all back on again just as rapidly.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?

AsQkzj3daa	Not very long.<br>  It's a poor diet, and it might ruin your health in the long run.<br>  <br>  I would go for a healthy 1600 calorie/day diet, with a lot of aurobics. Have many small meals every 3 hours to get your metabolism going, and have healthy snacks. Go for reduced fat and low calorie foods with lots of fruits and veggies, you need to eat healthy in order to lose weight. don't try something like that, because you'll probably gain all the weight back after losing it through that kind of diet. It's called crash dieting.|`|MF9YknDYaa	You do know this time next year you will be much fatter?|`|PwxmrBm9aa	This is very low in calories and your metabolism will probably slow right down so if you keep at this diet for a long time you will reach a plateau which is when your metabolism has really slowed down and loosing weight will be very very hard.<br>  <br>  Take care of yourself.|`|rp7W4fE4aa	you have to eat more! aim for the very least 1200cals of healthy food & eat 4 times min a day, this in turn will give you more energy to exercise & boost your metabolism. i don't know how old you are but what your doing right now is really unhealthy at any age.

If a blood clot has formed and is knocked loose it can quickly travel to major organs and cause horrible complications.  The only reason I would say that is because my dad had a pain in his leg a few years ago, and after a few days with it he woke up with the worst migraine.  He saw his doctor, and saw a specialist where they found a blood clot in the base of his brain.  Needless to say, there were complications and a long hospital stay that could have been avoided with a sooner diagnosis.<br>  Oh, and after further testing it turns out that he has some weird clotting disorder and is now on medication for it. Up until that "episode" he had never had any signs or symptoms for the disorder.

fTztIC22aa	Getting bigger while doing cardio is not possible you can't gain weight and lose weight at once it's one or the other. Cardio is for losing weight, but because of your position I suggest that you stick with the losing weight side. I'd say try and run 1 mile in 7:30 and when you can get that try and run 2 in say 17 minutes and slowly set goals for lowering it. That sounds like HIIT what you're describing that will help you with speed not distance.|`|OgTvqmJ9aa	Ha, we had this test yesterday, finished 2 miles 23 mins >.<<br>  <br>  my first tho, I will say tho it's more of a mental thing is what i was told. if you can run till you hit some point you can run forever, once you prove to your body it;s not dieing it'll settle off and continue to run.<br>  <br>  anyhow if you looking to increase speed so you can kill the 15min med then my advice wont help and im sorry for wasting your time. =]

It is possible to have a headache take some advil, and then get a fever, which is dangerous and can lead to swelling of the brain which can be fatal. If it's been 3 days I'd say go to a doctor. In the mean time try to get him to have some beef broth or consume soup, or orange juice. somehting to get his immune system running and some energy. Nothing solid and bland is always good. make sure he has at the very least water.<br>  Again set up an appointment with a docotor unless he took advil or anything with ibuprofen in it. in which case take him to the emergency room ASAP.|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	Well dummie take him to the Dr's office....DUH OMG YOU PEOPLE ARE SO DUMB!!|`|AxFk8hE6aa	heh...

PwxmrBm9aa	There are 3500 calories in one pound of fat so 3500 / 7 = 500 which would mean you would have to burn 500 calories a day to loose a pound a week.

And if you want to lose weight faster, add some cardio (no need to count the calories you burn here. If you burn 500 calories from cardio that doesn't mean that you HAVE TO eat 500 calories more.<br>  <br>  It will become a visible weightloss in time if you do it like this. The body can't create energy from nothing.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	To lose 1lb in weight you need to burn off an extra 3,500 calories or 500 a day as you say.

I incorporated the treadmill into my weight loss routine along with taking hoodia and honestly the weight started falling off. It's simple really, if you control your appetite and are eating less and you exercise more it's a great formula to drop as much weight as you desire in the areas you desire. What I liked best about hoodia was that I didn't feel like I was dieting. It took away my hunger and I didn't feel all lightheaded and run down like can happen when you cut back caloric intake. I had plenty of energy and if I had to diet, and I did, desert burn hoodia made it as enjoyable as possible as I lost my weight. I dropped 33 pounds in two months or so and didn't even feel like i was dieting. GOOGLE: online health desert burn hoodia : and you will see. I had great success with hoodia and treadmill/walking exercise and MAKE SURE you don't get any of that junk they sell in the mall @ GNC. Only 100% hoodia gordonii works this well and desert burn has that kind. So, like I said, check out some reading and check out the treadmill pages as well. Also, upping your protein and fiber intake is a great idea. Protein builds muscle which burns fat and fiber fill you up and keeps you regular. So, like I said, do that Google like I said and see for yourself. Hope this helps you out. hoodia really works, I'm living proof!!! Bye.|`|EB4O98eNaa	You need to cut sugar completely from your diet.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).<br>  <br>   jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|iQOqQGEpaa	I agree with ny the comment below. it is all matter of mind set. and i would start with diet first because 80% of losing weight is ur diet. No junk food. No sweets. No drinks, only water. No fat stuff. products that u eat should be fat-free. and always look at the labeles if it says Saturaded fat more than 5% and cholesterol more that 5% and any fats at all than don't buy it. remember anything that u buy: 20% is consider high. and workouts i would recomend running and then when u lose about 10 pound i would recomend to do cindy crawford workout  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=&search_query=cindy+crawford+workout&aq=1&oq=cindy+c" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/results?search_ty...</a> it will give u the best figure ever =)<br>  Good luck and don't give up =)|`|r6vk5yD6aa	join a yoga program  or  the gym|`|i4rFMFtPaa	if u jus do any exercise routine for 30min. a day for lik about 3-4days a week then u should see some results.<br>   they dont have to be a full straight 30 min. u can do 15 min in the morning and 15 min when u go to bed.. im a teen and its been working like that fo me so hope that helps! :)
qiDMTNvDaa	Well, i would suggest starting at about 30 minutes everyday (or as often as possible) Then you can work up. Jogging can be hard on your legs, giving you shin splints. To avoid this, you can stretch well, which leads me to answering your last question. The best stretches are lunges, and sitting down and doing the butterfly (i know, but it helpsyou hip joints) and pullin your leg up to your butt and holding it there for 30 seconds. Hope this helps!|`|ioVIAewjaa	you know, you could always join a track and field team and not have to worry about all this.<br>  but if you want to do it yourself..<br>  jog every day for 5 laps around a track.<br>  excluding weekends.<br>  go the same time every day and on the last 2 laps sprint for 200 meters.<br>  every 5 days that go by, increase the number of laps you jog by one.<br>  when you get to 8 laps a day, then stop and increase your speed instead.<br>  and do not stretch before, only stretch afterwards.|`|5PAP1hpSaa	jog for 15 min and 3 times a week<br>  <br>  <a href="http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb=370647" rel="nofollow">http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb...</a>

MvC6n3DWaa	The nature of Histrionic Personality Disorder is that the individual craves constant attention. They want to appear attractive and worthy of the attention. As they are consumed with how they are perceived and how they appear, they are not thinking about how others may feel. They will do anything to appear 'sexy', attractive and desirable. This includes taking part in sex acts that others may not find desirable, multiple partners as they crave the attention, and deceit in relationships as they are constantly seeking gratification from others approval. This does not make for a good marriage partner. Personality Disorders are commonly co-morbid with another disorder, it may be depression or some type of impulsive behavior. The result is a person that may not be willing to get help as they do not perceive their selves as needing help. <br>  <br>  All of us have known the woman who dresses overly provocatively, flirts openly and has indiscretions that do not help their personal lives.|`|vj93MNjBaa	If I were you I'd interview Megan Fox or Pamela Anderson.

2960ac7192ef5001ba3ec535d7f602d8aa	If you feel bloated in the morning, you are probably eating too much the night before. Don't eat past 7 or 8 the night before for a few nights, and you will eventually begin to wake up hungry. Breakfast is as important as everyone says. It prevents binging later in the day (it may be the reason you eat a lot at night) because it keeps you from getting so hungry. Eating only a couple of large meals a day can cause weight gain.|`|f7yJQbB4aa	Okay, you should eat only when you are hungry. But you have to make an exception for breakfast. That meal needs to be eaten, even if you don't feel hungry. Maybe you should try eating dinner earlier, and never ever eat after 8pm. That might help you have a morning apetite.

b876bdbe9593c6e05de8ebd41f870433aa	I have had both hips replaced (at age 59).  Interestingly, I was told at age 56 that I was "too young".  I toughed it out another 3 years as my world got smaller and smaller because I couldn't get through a full day's work and spent the last 8 months walking with a cane.  I took OTC Aleve for 4 years.  It worked pretty well the first couple of years but eventually even that wasn't enough.  <br>  <br>  If he chooses to try to get along for awhile longer, he should definitely start using some sort of walking aid - possibilities include a cane or crutches.  Crutches probably offer the best relief.  <br>  <br>  Also, if and when he decides to go with the recommended replacement, he should at least ask about ceramic/ceramic bearings because they produce fewer wear particles than the standard metal/poly bearing.  Another possibility (if he qualifies) might be hip resurfacing.  Resurfacing is a surgical treatment that involves capping the femoral head instead of cutting it off.<br>  <br>  While it is unusual, it is not unheard of for a person your husband's age to have total replacement.  The downside, which his doctor already is thinking about, is that young people, especially males, tend to be more active and, to put it simply, they may beat up & wear out their fake hips prematurely.  Here's a link to more on the subject of young age and hip replacement:<br>  <a href="http://totaljoints.info/young_age_for_thr.htm" rel="nofollow">http://totaljoints.info/young_age_for_th...</a><br>  The above link is from a website developed by an ortho surgeon as a service to patients.  It appears in [slightly fractured] English translation and without commercial content.  I recommend it.|`|oojO4WAraa	Ceramic ones last longer than the older style.  10 years used to be the life of a replacement joint. Ceramics last a lot longer.   If he needs it and is in pain - he should have his hip replaced.  The replacements don't last forever - but I heard you can get a second one.  Check with other doctors.|`|GT6396BDaa	I am very familiar with hip replacement surgery.  My best friend has rheumatoid arthritis.  They had both hips replaced when they were in their 20s(One at a time).  she was in constant pain, took medications like your husband and was using a cane to get around because she was in so much pain.  She is doing wonderful.  She can now walk without a cane and does not take any medications except those to help with the arthritis.<br>  I would go see another doctor.  Get a second or even third opinion if necessary.  Some doctors just don't understand or pay attention to how much pain a person is in, and how much the condition affects and limits their life.  Your husband is not the problem, the doctor is the problem.<br>  Today, hip replacement surgery is not nearly as complicated as it used to be, they use better hip replacements, usually made of porcelain and metal, and they last much longer, about 10-15 maybe even 20 years, depending on the health of the person.  When they do the surgery, you are up and walking the next day and doing physical therapy.  The main thing to watch for after surgery is infection.<br>  People of all ages have joint replacement surgeries.  It sounds like your husband is in severe pain.  He needs to see a different doctor and be honest with them, telling them just how much pain he is in and how it has affected his life.<br>  I would not wait, because it's only going to get worse.<br>  Best of luck.  Hope I helped.|`|d60e8f20b683cbea453ebac252df94f5aa	Well he has been diagnosed and in a lot of pain. If the doctor recommends it  ( and he should get a second opinion ) then he  is not too young..  Better to have it while young when your body can heal faster and probably not have as many side effects such as a permanent limp. The older you are the longer and harder it takes to recover|`|D3aTKIa7aa	My dad had a hip replacement at a very younge age. He was in his younge 20s when he had the sugurey.

There is too much of a possibility that the pain will get so bad he will need narcotics--and that can lead to an addiction problem!

Doctors cannot empathize with us...only he know if it's necessary for him. I expect that I'll require both of my hips to be replaced again, but the surgery is so easy to recover from, I would not hesitate.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I gave you a star so more people will see your question.  I think surgeries like this work both ways. I would do an internet search to see if you can find a group who specifically can answer your question. I suggest you read the book "You Can Heal Your life" by Louise Hay & look into EFT if you go on line there is a lady name Deborah Donnelinger or something like that who is very good & might be able to help him so he can avoid the surgery. I also have used EFT & went off of pain pills last year. Trust your intuition. I can tell you are not feeling what the Dr. is telling you & you & your husband have a different feeling. I think if you follow that it is your inner guidance & you won't go wrong. I think you know your answer.|`|AA12041870	No.  If he is in pain, the younger he gets this surgery, the better he will come through it.  If he hurts, don't put it off.  The pain and discomfort is making a difference in your family life, his business life, the kid's lives.  Do it and get it done, especially if you have the funds and/or insurance to pay for it now.  Believe it or not, that money plays into what a doctor says need be done now.
fAwLfyV3aa	you need to push yourself to a higher limit- try doing push ups with your legs crossed in back or on a stability ball. this is called overload. You can't change anything if you keep doing the same thing. try one handed pull ups, and just take things to the next level.|`|W2YtVUqKaa	if you just do pull ups and push ups then you 're just lifting the same weight so of course it won't change. if you want to get bigger then you have to increase the weight you lift|`|vURKBxvWaa	push ups and pull ups are just muscle endurance workouts.<br>  the only way to get bigger is to lift heavier and heavier weights.<br>  <br>  basic weightlifting science:<br>  when you lift weights (heavy weights), you are putting your muscles through a lot of stress and actually tears up the muscle fibers.  and when i say heavy weights, i mean weight that is heavy for you, not heavy as in the weight some other big *** bodybuilder guy does.  after your workout, your body wants to compensate for that stress so, if you intake proper nutrition after your workout, your body will be able to rebuild your muscles bigger and stronger so that it will be better prepared to handle the stress next time.<br>  thats a pretty basic explination. its much more complicated than that.<br>  <br>  so if you keep doing the same weight, such as push ups and pull ups, your body is already used to it and will not get bigger. so lift weights, get bigger, get stronger. after you get used to those weights, increase the weight, and get even bigger and even stronger. and so on, it just a cycle.
RWULEFe0aa	No. Raw eggs can give you salmonella and I am sure you really wouldn't what that now would you. The best way to put on weight if you need to is eat a fat based diet.

You could get salmonella poisoning. I have been lifting weights for over 10 years now. If you really want to bulk up then pack on the protein. A great source of protein would be chicken and fish. You can eat baked chicken and baked fish if you want lean muscle. You can also eat tuna as well. These will definitely help with the bulk in muscles. Anything high in protein will do just fine since protein is the major building block of muscle growth. The more protein intake the more bulk. Also adding carbs as well such as pasta.

Done properly and consistently, they should add close to an inch or two to your penis in six weeks.<br>  <br>  1. Penis stretches. This one is very simple. Just take your flaccid penis and stretch it as far out in front of your body as it will go. Do it gently and gradually and hold it there for thirty seconds. Rest ten seconds between sets and repeat this at least ten times.<br>  <br>  2. Jelqing. This is another great technique for rookies. Get your penis halfway erect, apply lubrication, and grip it tightly at the base with the thumb and forefinger of one hand. Slowly slide that hand up the shaft toward the tip, pushing as much blood into your penis as possible. When you reach the tip, immediately grip the base the same way using the other hand and repeat. Do this nonstop for ten minutes.<br>  <br>  3. Ulis. This is a great exercise to increase girth. It is also very easy and does not take much time. Achieve a full erection and grip the base of your penis the same way you would if you were jelqing. <br>  <br>  Squeeze as hard as you can without causing discomfort. Your penis shaft should swell and your penis head should get big and shiny. Hold for ten seconds and rest for ten seconds. Repeat this three or four times.<br>  <br>  Do this routine every other day and make sure you warm your penis up before each workout by wrapping it in a hot washcloth for five minutes.<br>  <br>  4. A larger penis can be achieved with the use of penis enhancers. There are many forms of penis enhancement products such as pills, patches and topical oils. However, one unique natural product that can produce significant results and makes use of the body's natural abilities comes in the form of a liquid called super-vir <a href="http://www.super-vir.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-vir.com</a><br>  <br>  Always remember, if you are not satisfied with what you were born with, it is never too late to do something about it!|`|GeYgAHnFaa	how much is yours first<br>  then measure with a normal man - hahaha,<br>  <br>  Mr Rahul  it depends on the country and person to person so dont worry it will grow.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|F8EnH6JQaa	A DIET IS WHAT YOU EAT....there for we are all on a diet....<br>  THINK LIFESTYLE CHANGE<br>  <br>  You got the change the way you think and feel about food<br>  <br>  TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  The first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your body adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  <br>  Don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package....<br>  .....THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD.....<br>  If man made it, don't eat it<br>  <br>  NO white BREAD or SUGAR<br>  <br>  NO FRIED FOOD...<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  Walk your dog, or walk a friends dog<br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water.

Make sure that the weight you are trying to acheive is healthy. (Search for a BMI calculator to find out).<br>  <br>  In order to avoid writing a book here, I would suggest your next step would be to go to www.MyPyramid.gov.

Eat lots of veggies and drink veggie drinks (eg. V8) whenever you are hungry. Eat chicken breast for protein.

QB1u1I3kaa	The best way to orgasm is by gently rubbing your clitoris. To find your clitoris go right to the top of your slit, where the 2 sides meet, under your belly button, slide your finger between the lips, and feel around at the back for a small lump. It should tingle when you touch it. Lick your finger, and rub the lump gently in small circles. Keep rubbing, your vagina should start to get wet. Keep rubbing, next you will feel like you really need to pee. You DON'T need to pee, the feeling will pass, keep rubbing. Next you will feel a weird feeling in your tummy, try to hold that feeling in as long as possible, when you cant hold the feeling in any longer, let it go

AA11770886	When we have any ailment we go to a consultant. They also sometimes do a trial and error method. For some diseases, the reasons are not found out immediately and so a method of elimination is adopted. Why don't you try the same? First try to stop smoking. Any how smoking is injurious to health. Tonsillitis can also be a reason. You can try taking some antibiotics. If it does not cure your infection (" -itis" means inflammation due to infection also.) then you will have to go for the option of tonsillectomy. <br>  Some people do get allergic rhinitis. This amounts to cold syndrome. Temperature is one cause. The best way is to gargle Luke warm saline water morning and evening. That will control inflammation of tonsils and cold due to that. Steam inhalation also is suggested. Nasal drops and other medication are also good. Try to keep your ears covered during cold nights. that also helps.|`|ADP9swbMaa	I have one friend who keeps getting very sick. She's been sick every month since November.

Please read this last sentence again.<br>  <br>  The mouth is a pretty inhospitable place for HIV and HIV is not often acquired orally. Unprotected anal, vaginal sex and sharing needles are what allows for the vast majority of transmissions.<br>  <br>  There is a lot of misconceptions out there about just how HIV is and isn't transmitted and what actually increases or decreases risk. Kissing and saliva do not transmit HIV and even if there was visible amounts of HIV+ blood in the saliva, the chance of it coming into contact with bloodstream is negligible. <br>  <br>  HIV can cross mucosal membranes without cuts, but it is MUCH less likely to occur in the mouth due to the thickness of the mucosal membrane compared with 1 cell thick membranes on the cervix and rectum, and 12 cell thick vaginal walls. In these areas, HIV can cross the membrane without a break in the membrane. So, in the case of oral acquisition, there almost always is some sort of break/abrasion on the mucosal membrane that allows for getting HIV orally.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	HIV can be transmitted by saliva, but it has a much lower chance than through other bodily fluids.|`|dX4Dll0yaa	Possible but highly unlikely.|`|Sn4zj9T3aa	not enough hiv to hurt you|`|L6Us1loTaa	OK first of all, it is possible, however very unlikely for it to be passed in this way. You would need a serious amount of infected saliva to be exposed to a cut for long periods of time. Secondly, cuts bleed out and do not suck in, so even if HIV infected was dripped onto another cut, it would still be quite unlikely.<br>  This is why sex is dangerous, as a penis can push the infected semen or blood into rips or tears. <br>  Although better safe than sorry, and odds only mean so much..|`|50ca49acd54c91d903d473e093ea2d38aa	no, The HIV has to be transferred from one person's blood stream to another's.

ItJzrvQ4aa	Those who are extremely lean tend to have weaker immune systems,<br>  making them prone to infections, surgical complications, and slower<br>  recovery times for illness. They tend to have low muscle mass, and<br>  less than ideal hair, teeth, and skin composition. They may have<br>  disruptions in the ability to regulate hormones and protect bone<br>  health, and women could become unable to menstruate.<br>  There are many reasons why people may find it hard to gain weight.<br>  Genetics can obviously play a role, but individual personalities and<br>  the environment can be strong factors.<br>  Some people are just more physically active, they tend to move around<br>  more,<br>  burning more calories than they take in. In children, the inability<br>  to gain weight may signal a condition<br>  known as "failure to thrive," which means a kid is not growing<br>  appropriately for his/her age. This may be caused by an illness, or<br>  eating patterns dictated by a parental idiosyncrasy. <br>  Being able to eat anything with abandon is also deceiving -- even the<br>  skinny need to worry about having too much sugar and fat for good<br>  health. Poor diets can lead to ailments such as heart disease,<br>  stroke, and<br>  cancer. <br>  If you want to put on weight, you should work out, to insure that you<br>  put on muscle and not fat. Healthy weight gain, just like healthy<br>  weight loss, takes time and<br>  requires a conscious effort to apply good habits.<br>  Recommended Ways to Gain Weight<br>  Have meals with the right balance of proteins, carbohydrates, and the<br>  right kinds of fat (such as unsaturated and monounsaturated fats,<br>  olive oil, canola oil, pistachios, almonds and walnuts). Heinemann<br>  suggests the following ratio: 60%-70% carbohydrates, 10%-15% protein,<br>  and a small amount of fat. <br>  Eat foods higher in calories, vitamins, and minerals, as opposed to<br>  higher in fat or sugar. <br>  Pack more nutritious calories in each serving. For example, you may<br>  add grated cooked eggs to mashed potatoes, ground chicken to soups and<br>  gravies, cheese in casseroles, eggs, and soups, and nonfat dried milk<br>  in soups, shakes, milk, and mashed potatoes. <br>  If you get too full too fast, try having more high-calorie foods or<br>  slices of foods as opposed to consuming the whole thing (raisins<br>  versus grapes, granola and Grape Nuts versus corn flakes, mango slices<br>  versus the whole mango). <br>  Limit drinking beverages to a half-hour before and after a meal. <br>  Drink mixed juices (apple/berry, peach/orange/banana as opposed to<br>  one juice beverages) for a higher calorie intake. <br>  With moderation, you may add in good fat sources to meals such as<br>  nuts, avocado, olives, and fatty fish (salmon and mackerel). <br>  Snack in between meals. Nuts, dried fruits, and yogurt are good<br>  options, but it's also important to find nutritious foods that you<br>  will enjoy. <br>  Have a nutritious snack before bedtime, such as a peanut butter<br>  sandwich.|`|n3pSWkg0aa	Trust me, you do not want to gain weight, you'll end up regretting it, if you're naturally skinny it's fine, and later on, everyone will be jealous of how skinny you are.<br>  um, try peanut butter, it has like 90 calories for 1 tbs. and try eating meat, maybe if you want to gain fast (which I would NEVER recommend) eat tonnes of junk food.<br>  <br>  hope i helped xx<br>  <br>  answer mine please? :)<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AouCAwlgBvLuz8NTHAwxIDzsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307100146AACiPO0">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|sg6JieT8aa	hey, my middle name is Lacey. nice name eh? well, I am just like you.

U6C4Bywwaa	for some reason girls think having muscle is a bad thing....its not!! You will not bulk up b/c unless you are taking steroids or some other type of testosterone supplement, your body will not let you "bulk up". If you want to lose fat on your arms then you will need some muscle. Buy some small hand weights min 2 lbs, max 5-6 lbs. Do 4 sets of 15 every day. Also do a little cardio maybe 30 mins 3 x per week. You should notice a difference within 2-4 weeks. Good luck?
UZJ7wVc8aa	The key to starting an exercise routine is to make the changes slowly. You can't go from being sedentary to active overnight and hope to succeed. Start out by exercising 1-2 times per week and eventually moving up to 3-5 times per week. Only increase the amount of exercise you do per week when you feel ready.<br>  <br>  Exercise routines also have to be well rounded to be successful. You need elements of flexibility, cardiovascular and strength training. You don't need to go to the gym to get a good workout, but having access to that type of equipment is a definite plus. Flexibility isn't very intensive and can be done on most if not all days of the week. It won't directly help you with your goals but it will lead to better performance - it will make exercising a lot easier.<br>  <br>  Cardio should be done 3-5 times per week while strength training should be done 2-3 times per week.

You can lose 10lbs in a week from water which is what many weightloss ads lie about. but it wont be fat, it might be 1 or 2 lbs of fat but the rest will be water and muscle. which is not good because if you lose muscle your metabolism will slow down and you will burn even less calories then when you started. here are some rules. if you want to stay fit for the rest of your life not just for a week, a month or a year then you will have to change your eating lifestyle. dont eat processed foods like junk food, cereals, candy, gatorades. also dont eat too much red meat only every once in a while. the number 1 rule for losing FAT and not weight is calories burned over calories consumed. if you burn more calories then you consume then you will lose fat. get into the habit of counting calories. an example if you burn 2500 calories a day then eat 2200 calories and that will be a 300 calories from fat that you will lose a day. although the food has to be clean(healthy) proteins like fish and chicken, carbs like potatoes, carrots, and a little bit of fat like fish oil. also you cant keep the burning more calories then you burn forever. after three days the body will sense that its losing too many calories and will slow down the metabolism so the 2200 will nolonger have effect. so do this burn more calories then you eat for 3 days and on the 4th day eat 2500, that will keep the metabolism up and just repeat. so in theory you would be losing 1800 calories (300x6) from fat a week. it may not seem like much but thats about 2 lbs a month x 12 months is 24 lbs a year! it all adds up. but once you've reached the body you want all you have to do is maintain it with eating the same number of calories as you burn. hope you go through with this and imagine your new body|`|oGaGXondaa	stop eating anything w sugar.<br>  stop eating things like rice, pasta, and bread (unless its multigrain, then eat it seldomly)<br>  stay away from food with trans fats (greasy stuff) and pork<br>  eat beef seldomly<br>  eat a lot of vegetables, chicken, fish, fiber, and vitamins.<br>  drink antioxidants and supplements.<br>  walk everyday for an hour, and lift a little weight.<br>  get into jogging or running <- this is a BIG helper|`|GjKeBTqRaa	I have the perfect solution....my housemade used to do it all the time.....she would loose like 5 pounds a week.

I incorporated hiking into my weight loss routine along with taking hoodia and honestly the weight started falling off. It's simple really, is you control your appetite and are eating less and you exercise more it's a great formula to drop as much weight as you desire. What I liked best about hoodia was that I didn't feel like I was dieting. It took away my hunger and I didn't feel all lightheaded and run down like can happen when you cut back caloric intake.

I'm sure that you could do it, but it would be nearly impossible to maintain. I did something similar, and lost ten pounds in two weeks. I was ecstatic, but then my body reached a plateau. If you are starving yourself, your body will only lose a certain amount of weight before it reacts to starvation. Then even the tiniest extra thing that you eat, i.e. a bowl of soup, frozen yogurt, two sandwiches instead of one, will cause you to gain weight. This is known as "starvation mode". Your body thinks you're starving, so it holds on to everything you eat in order to prevent starvation. Starvation mode is NOT fun (I was there for 2 years, maintaining a weight of 130 on 1,000 calories a day because I REFUSED to gain weight). <br>  <br>  Don't do it! It's fun now, but in the long run you may come to seriously regret it when you can't lose weight anymore!

jE0Y9su5aa	Yes replacing bad fat with good fat will definetely help you lose weight. But even more importantly, it will make you healthier. <br>  <br>  we all need fats. Fats helps nutrient absorption, nerve transmission, maintaining cell membrane integrity etc. However, when consumed in excess amount, fats contribute to weight gain, heart disease and certain types of cancer. Fats are not created equal. Some fats promote our health positively while other increase our risks of heart disease. The key is to replace bad fats with good fats in our diet.<br>  <br>  Good fats:<br>  <br>  Monounsaturated fats (MUFAs) lower total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) while increasing HDL cholesterol (the good cholesterol). Nuts including peanuts, walnuts, almonds and pistachios, avocado, canola and olive oil are high in MUFAs. MUFAs have also been found to help in weight loss, particularly body fat.<br>  <br>  Polyunsaturated fats also lower total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Seafood like salmon and fish oil, as well as corn, soy, safflower and sunflower oils are high in polyunsaturated fats. Omega 3 fatty acids belong to this group<br>  <br>  Bad Fats:<br>  <br>  Saturated fats raise total blood cholesterol as well as LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol). Saturated fats are mainly found in animal products such as meat, dairy, eggs and seafood. Some plant foods are also high in saturated fats such as coconut oil, palm oil and palm kernel oil.<br>  <br>  Trans fats are invented as scientists began to "hydrogenate" liquid oils so that they can withstand better in food production process and provide a better shelf life. As a result of hydrogenation, trans fatty acids are formed.

I tend to not think of loosing weight in pounds because muscle weighs more then fat, therefore if you gain more muscle you will weigh more, so just look in a mirror and judge on what you see. Good plus for both of us is that it is easier to turn fat into muscle then nothing into muscle. What I am going to start doing is running every morning. I wake up at around 6.30, but what im going to start doing is waking up at 5.45 and jogging around the neighborhood then showering. (: Too loose my tummy weight im going to start doing more sit ups of course but my fav exercises that works my legs and abs at the same time is i lie down, take a stability ball (one of those huge bouncy balls) and hold it in between my legs (ankles) then i lift my legs slowly so im in an L shape with my legs up and then i slowly bring my legs down. (repeat, duhh) Im definitely going to cut down on the muffin for breakfast thing and try things like fruits and some type of juice. And water is always better then gatorade or vitamin water (lots of calories). upper body- i have kind of small boobs :( (32A) and i want to keep them, so if you want to keep yours, try doing upper body exercises such as push ups and weight lifting. These will make up your chest nice a tight. haha that sounds funny. And also try doing squats those tone down thighs. GOOD LUCK! (:<br>  <br>  edit- hehe i forgot to mention, when working out try listening to your ipod or mp3 if you own one, and listen to upbeat music - always gives me an energy boost. And instead of having your mom pick you up from the bus stop try walking home and taking the stairs instead of the elevator and just little things like that.

I found that once I was strong and felt able and capable with THAT I added morning & evening walk.

If you try to lose faster, your body will go into "starvation mode" and get very stingy about burning calories while at the same time very efficient about storing any calories that you do provide. And it will make you feel awful. <br>  <br>  There is no site specific way of losing fat... the old myth about working your abs to burn belly fat isn't true. To get rid of love handles, you need to lose overall fat. That happens with exercise and watching your diet. More on that below. <br>  <br>  The most effective way to lose fat is aerobic exercise in the "moderate" fat-burning range, ideally first thing in the morning before you eat. When you wake your body is ready to burn fat and your levels of growth hormone are highest at that time. Later in the day it can take up to 30 minutes just to put your body into a fat-burning mode. <br>  <br>  Another overlooked way to burn fat is by lifting weights. Skeletal muscle has very high caloric needs... almost twice that of adipose (fat) tissue. Put on a little muscle and you will burn calories all day even at rest. Be aware that skeletal muscle weighs more, so with this approach you may see your weight increasing while your body fat is melting away. Not realizing this often stresses folks who think they should be losing weight as a measure of fitness. Forget the scale, look in the mirror and you will be happy.<br>  <br>  To lose a pound of fat, you need to eliminate about 3500 calories. You can do this by burning more with exercise or by modifying your diet to reduce intake. If you do a Google search on say, "swimming calories" you will quickly find a website with tables of calories burned for a given exercise. You can use such lists to estimate how many calories you are burning up with your routine.<br>  <br>  For diet, keep a diary for a couple of weeks counting calories, grams of protein, and grams of fat intake. It is easy with online sources of nutritional information (type the name of the food and calories into the Google search engine) and packaging labels. That will let you quickly figure out where the fat is coming from in your diet. <br>  <br>  Fat gives you 9 calories per gram. So take the number of grams of fat, multiply by 9, then calculate what percentage the fat calories are of your total daily calories. Restricting the calories from fat to about 20% of your total intake is ideal for a maintenance diet... that isn't overly restrictive. Of note, you need some fat in your diet. For instance, the body uses fat to produce hormones. Once you have a picture of how to modify your diet, you can drop the diary and just go back to it occasionally if you are wanting to tweek things further.<br>  <br>  There is a subset of questions that goes further and asks about "How to get a six-pack?" The answer is the same. Six-packs are 20% abdominal exercise and 80% diet. There is one caveat... abdominal muscles will form in the position that you work them, so be certain to pull them tightly toward your spine while doing crunches, etc. Also, during most lifting, the "core is active" which means that you should be stabilizing with contracted abs then too. Fail to do this and the abs will form, but bulging outward and the result is not attractive.<br>  <br>  If you are trying to build muscle as a way to lose fat, then you may need to increase total calories and specifically your protein intake. I target about 0.8 g of protein per pound of body weight each day when actively building. That is far more protein than most people need in their diets.|`|f05TawR0aa	Lowering your overall body fat is the best way to do it, so watch your caloric intake (try burning about 500 calories more than you consume per day, and never eat less than 1300 calories per day unless you want your metabolism to curl up and die). As for exercise, cardio - especially running or swimming - is thebest way to go. To tighten up your abs, try crunches and reverse crunches. This exercise is also great for toning: Lie flat on your back on an exercise mat with your toes pointing directly upwards. Lift your heels about 2 inches off the ground, hold for a moment, then lower them again (you should feel this working your stomach muscles).<br>  <br>  Also, a lot of apparent weight in the stomach area could be down to posture and bloating. If you hunch your shoulders forward all the time it will make your stomach look bigger, so try to keep your back straight. As for bloating, there are a number of ways to reduce it but herbal teas like peppermint and chamomile will work wonders. Carbonated drinks fill your stomach with air, making it look bigger, and likewise chewing gum will bloat you because it forces air into your digestive system.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

wyAbkG3oaa	First of all, go and see your doctor. He may offer you medication that can help, and if you do not want medication, he may offer you somebody to talk to which helps. I have both right now. I find that when I feel really down, it is tempting to just lay in bed and not bother fighting back, but you have to.

If you are having a serious depression and you are unable to get out of bed, or shower daily, or eat, than you need a way to get up and get busy. I was depressed for years and I went to counselor after counselor and tried all kinds of anti-depressants which in the end just made the problem worse for me. In the end, getting up and going to work every day and starting to do artwork, painting, and writing, in my free time were the most helpful. I wasn't able to help others, but if I could have, I think that would have saved me too.  I did have one counselor who helped me by telling me one thing, and I'd have to say it worked, and I'd do it again.  She said, "go through the motions of being happy, pretending you are happy, act as if you were happy, and it will come back to you, and you will begin to feel happy."  I did it, and the first day I tried it, I thought no way will this work, and that day was the first day of getting well again. Try it, it can be the beginning. I was surprised it worked,  the first day I let (made) myself smile, laugh, feel anything at all that wasn't part of the illness of being depressed.

People with flat feet or with feet shaped in a way that put a lot of pressure on the big toe joint are more likely to develop them. People who wear tight shoes or high heels are likely to develop bunions too.<br>  <br>  Most bunions can be treated at home by wearing comfortable shoes, trying not to put pressure on your foot and applying over the counter medications for toe pain.

But with that said you could still lose some weight and have a healthy BMI.  I recently changed my diet to lose weight.  I cut my calories to 1200 a day.  I eat very little carbs and sugars.  Eat more protein and veggies.  Exercise is great but I didn't exercise at all last month and just based on a diet change and drinking only water and a little milk with some meals I lost 17 lbs in 4 weeks.

If you loose weight to quickly, you may loose muscle mass, not just fat, and invite heart problems.|`|8SRjELNBaa	not in a healthy way.|`|lysXZePVaa	Yes it is possible, but it's not recommended. You shouldn't lose more than 1-3 pounds a week. So at the most you'd lose about 12.5 pounds if you lost 3lbs. a week. I've recently lost 11lbs, but it was almost two months.<br>  <br>  Not sure how much you weigh or your height, but I will tell you how I am losing weight. I eat an average of 1300-1500 calories diet, most days 1300 with an occasional 1500. I eat as natural as possible lean meats such as chicken and fish, nothing fried, no sodas, no junk food (only occasionally and in moderation), I make my own pizzas, french fries and burgers and it's half as many calories, drink lots of water, cut back on sugars, eat more protein and fiber because it keeps you full longer, cut back on carbs and make them whole grain and not white, eat 5-6 mini meals a day this will keep you metabolism going and you won't be hungry, stop eating after like 6-7pm, eat lots of fruits and vegetables, don't under eat because it will put your body into starvation mode, do 30-45 minutes of cardio 5-6 times a week and at least 20-30 minutes of strength taining 5-6 times a week, make sure you have a rest day. Weight loss should be a slow and steady process, but you will keep the weight off if you do it in a healthy way. Dieting will only make you gain weight once you lose it. You need to make a lifestyle change.

8a2ebc183110448f4c3847d3aa539174aa	A healthy weight-loss would be about 1-2lbs a week. That's it. So its reasonable that you might not feel much different just yet.<br>  <br>  Also, because of the yo-yo dieting you did before, it might take a few months for your body to sort itself out to where its functioning properly again.<br>  <br>  You are doing the right thing to eat more healthily. Soon you will notice that you feel lighter, and have more energy. You will probably notice that you feel happier more often then before.<br>  <br>  But if you want to give the weight-loss a bit of a kick-start. I would recommend trying to get in 30 minutes of exercise a day.<br>  <br>  Also, in addition to weighing yourself, take your measurements. You will probably find that you loose more inches then pounds in the beginning. That's because muscle is leaner but is heavier than fat. The more muscle mass you have, the more calories you burn even when you are sleeping or watching TV. So its a win-win.<br>  <br>  Best wishes with your weight-loss journey. :)|`|25Whzu2waa	Weight loss, from the way you've been eating now, is going to occur. Exercise will help dramatically improve weight loss (jogging/CARDIO) but remember this: great weight loss by HEALTHY results is 7-9 pounds a month, maybe 10. Any more, and you're eating too little; massive dieting will result in you going to the hospital and gaining the weight back, so don't do that. ;)|`|YWfeRt41aa	No, you're loosing weight all the time - just not in big enough amounts to make it obvious - if you persevere you will see a change after a few weeks. <br>  good luck.|`|83y9Vu5oaa	it doesn't just magically come off, it takes time. months, even years with some people. and are you working out? that could be another reason|`|nIZmE4a2aa	You are on the right path but you need to compliment you diet with exercise, Aerobic and Cardio.

And just recently i went on another diet and only ate sandwiches with Marmite in(marmite is a low calorie yeast extract spread) and in 2 weeks i lost 11lbs, so thats jus under a lb a day. but the key it losing weight IS the exercise, when exercising your metabolism boosts by 8 times, so in an hour of exercising you woud burn of the amount that you would usually burn in 8 hours. Also remember to get a lot of healthy proteins in as these increase the amount of muscle you will gain, and the more muscle surface area you have, the more fat you can burn, and therefore burn your 35lb target quicker. also go on google and type in "how many calories do I burn in a day" or something like that to find out how much you burn, these are often measures ofhow much you burn WITHOUT EXERCSING, so if you exercise aswell you will urn more off. And to burn off 1lb of body fay you need to burn 3,500 calories, so you can work around that target it gives you, (obviously you would eat les than you need to lose weight) hope it helps :)

When your blood sugar falls, that's when your body feels hungry.  Decrease your carb intake, and increase your protein and fat intake (remember the Atkin's plan?)

They come in various diameters and weights (too heavy and you can get a lot of bruising). I picked mine up at a Sport & Health club, but there a bunch of sites online too. Hoop with it lower on your hips to help tone up all your gluteal muscles. A toned butt will take up less space.<br>  Lunges and step ups (steps should be at least 12 inches high) are excellent too.<br>  Aside from all that, you sound like you have killer stats... why change?

It gets awful boring after a while.  But you can replace your breakfast and lunch with this and eat a sensible dinner and lose a little weight.  Hint:  You can do the same thing eating a bowl of oatmeal for 2 meals and drinking a glass of water.  Its cheaper and about the same concept.|`|8SRjELNBaa	sounds like another hopeless fad diet...|`|8n3NvYQwaa	maybe it could be Ms Grass Hopper if it is made of oat meal, rasins and some nuts...............   mmmmmmmmmmmm?

What is important is how INTENSE your exercise periods are. <br>  <br>  You want to work out as hard as you can for a minute or two, then have a rest period (don't stop completely just slow down, catch your breath and let your heart rate drop) and then repeat. <br>  <br>  See my website for more information on exercising for weight loss. <br>  <br>  B Schibly MD<br>  <a href="http://www.physicians-weight-loss-tips.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.physicians-weight-loss-tips.c...</a>|`|hLQa3VtYaa	haha No ones gonna know what speed 3 on you treadmill equates to.......... and its different for everyone... very roughly .. usually over 100 calories for every mile you go|`|PIQaTuAZaa	think it depends on your height and wieght its different for every 1|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	There are lots of calorie counter website you can figure this out.. here is one I found or you can add up your total minutes and figure out the calories burned<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.caloriesperhour.com/index_burn.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.caloriesperhour.com/index_bur...</a>|`|OgTvqmJ9aa	None, duh.

de61674560750ca671798a74d4f68053aa	Foods that are not fatty, but have high protein. Foods like tuna, lean meat, turkey, beads, etc help. You can also drink milk or whey protein shake every day.|`|6W9vXKmFaa	fast food|`|WBcBvufWaa	Foods that will help you gain more muscle usually come from good source of protein such as fish(watch out for the ones with excess mercury), chicken breast(white meat), and from beans and nuts. If you are very busy you may want to add a protein shake in between your meals. however majority of the protein shakes out in the market contain harmful ingredients and also synthetic ingredients in them which may bring other health problems. If you would like I can send you some diet plans and some recommendations of supplements where it will help your body build more muscle mass and keep you on a healthy lifestyle. btw, if you don't have the time to go to the gym. you can always MAKE the time my friend!|`|AA11707728	Bull testicles.<br>  <br>  No....I'm not kidding.<br>  <br>  Back before the invention of synthetic steroids, warriors would eat these in large amounts because they contain testosterone.  Your muscles grow not because of the weight lifting but because of the testosterone released in your body when you work large muscle groups.<br>  <br>  Note that this is the ONLY type of food which will make your muscles grow.  Most people with a western diet have ten times their need for protein, most from high quality meat sources....so supplementing this does nothing.  Now, if you were some starving ethiopian subsisting on millet, then, yeah, you'd get alot out of a protein supplement or some of the other garbage passed off as growing muscles.<br>  <br>  But realistically, for the average american/european guy, supplementing testosterone is the only way.  And that means either juicing (steroids are really, REALLY bad for you) or having a talk with your butcher.|`|iBsdnNDXaa	Actually, you don't need to diet per se in order to lose weight, the only thing that clearly delivered for me is green tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a handful of free trials left, it was reported in Reader's Digest and USA Today.

jE0Y9su5aa	The reason green tea is getting so much attention in the scientific world is because it contains many anti-oxidants. The reason that anti-oxidants are important for you is that they prevent free radicals. As for losing weight. The only reason that green tea causes weight loss is because when you drink 5 cups or more a day the liquid volume keeps your stomach full so you eat less. Also, you will notice that you go for bowel movements more often which will also help you lose weignt. Here is the scientific explanation on the health benefits of green tea: <br>  <br>  <br>  A scientific explanation: In essence, a free radical is any molecular species capable of independent existence, that contains one or more unpaired electrons not contributing to intermolecular bonding, and is, in that sense, "free". They are produced by oxidation/reduction reactions, in which there is a transfer of only one electron at a time, or when a covalent bond is broken and one electron from each pair remains with each atom. Thus, a free radical has an unpaired electron.<br>  <br>  Many free radicals are highly reactive, owing to the tendency of electrons to pair; that is, to pair by the receipt of an electron from an appropriate donor or to donate an electron to an appropriate acceptor. Whenever a free radical reacts with a non-radical, a chain reaction is initiated until two free radicals react and then terminate the propagation with a 2-electron bond, with each radical contributing its single unpaired electron. The free radicals of special interest in aging are the oxygen free radicals (OH., H., O2.-). These free radicals often take an electron away from a "target" molecule to pair with their single free electron; this is what is commonly termed oxidation. The term reactive oxygen species is used to refer to these oxidants and the oxygen free radicals.<br>  <br>  In the human body, oxidized free radicals are believed to cause tissue damage at the cellular level, causing damage to our DNA, mitochondria (the powerhouse of the cell), and cell membrane, and have often been referred to as one of the causes attributed to aging, cancer, heart disease, and other human ailments harmful to one's health. While the green tea ion of free radicals is a normal part of metabolism at the cellular level, things such as excessive alcohol intake, smoking, and various chemical exposures only serve to increase the amount of free radicals present in the body. To prevent free radical damage the body has a defense system of antioxidants. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Antioxidants are molecules which can safely interact with free radicals and terminate the chain reaction before vital molecules are damaged (as in Vitamin C), or seek out and scavenge free radicals ( as in Vitamin E ). This is where it can be noted that research has indicated that one of the main antioxidants found in green tea ( epigallocatechin 3-gallate a.k.a. EGCG ) has been found to be much more powerful than both Vitamins C and E. Compared to other known antioxidants, EGCG was found to be 100 times more effective than vitamin C, 25 times more effective than Vitamin E and twice as powerful as resveratrol at neutralizing free radicals.|`|QDl5owvNaa	Yes, it can help you lose weight.

zLpsu8GBaa	As the above answer stated, limit your calorie intake especially sugars, complex carbohydrates, and starches.<br>  <br>  Otherwise you have about 43 days to lose 20 pounds, and that is completely doable if you start exercising at least one hour day, 5-6 days a week. Nothing too strenuous, but you certainly need to do some sort of aerobic activity. Lacrosse practice may be difficult, but if it something your body does every week, then you will start compensating and adapting to that activity. You need to start varying the activity, and do it more often.<br>  <br>  Over, a little more diet and lot more exercise will get you there.<br>  Good luck.|`|y2Uks58paa	RUN.....A...LOT.. diet will help too|`|DybOqfGpaa	yes go for cabbage soup diet it will wonder for u<br>  Cabbage Soup Diet Information<br>  (and How To Lose Up To 10 lbs In A Single Week)<br>  <br>  Home ? Cabbage Soup Recipe ? 7 Day Plan ? Experiences ? Health ? Discussion<br>  If you have a special occasion coming up, or you simply need to lose weight fast, the Cabbage Soup Diet may be just what you're looking for.<br>  <br>  cabbage imageAlthough not suitable for long-term weight loss, the Cabbage Soup Diet is a low-fat, high-fiber diet that will help you get into shape fast before you embark on a more moderate long-term eating plan.<br>  <br>  Pros and Cons of the Cabbage Soup Diet<br>  <br>  Pros: You'll lose weight fast, and can get as much of the foods listed in the program as you want. Although the diet is only for seven days (and shouldn't be adhered to for longer), it provides a great "kick-start" for a more moderate diet.<br>  <br>  Cons: Some people find the soup bland. Some people have reported feeling light-headed, weak, and have suffered from decreased concentration (although some who have been affected in this way felt it was well worth it, since it was only for a week and they had lost considerable weight).<br>  <br>  What the Cabbage Soup Diet is NOT<br>  <br>  The cabbage soup diet is sometimes referred to as the "Mayo Clinic Diet", and the "Sacred Heart Hospital Diet". Interestingly, this diet has nothing to do with either the Mayo Clinic, nor any Sacred Heart Hospital we know about.<br>  <br>  The Problem With Most "Mainstream" Diets<br>  <br>  Most diets - especially "mainstream" diets, and those recommended by major medical institutions - work slowly but surely, resulting in around 1 pound of weight loss per week.<br>  <br>  This "slow and steady" way to lose weight is certainly healthy, but suffers from one significant drawback : most people get discouraged and quit whatever diet they are on if they don't see results quickly.<br>  <br>  Seven Keys to Success<br>  <br>  1. Follow the diet religiously.<br>  2. Drink at least 4 glasses of water per day<br>  3. Keep in mind that it's only seven days<br>  4. Complement the diet with a good multivitamin tablet<br>  5. Print the information on this site so you can refer to it daily<br>  6. Eat plenty of soup - as much as you want! Do not try to starve yourself or you'll probably cheat and break the diet<br>  7.

Eat only your soup and the fruit for the first day. For drinks- unsweetened teas, cranberry juice and water.<br>  <br>  Day Two:<br>  Vegetables: Eat until you are stuffed will all fresh, raw or cooked vegetables of your choice. Try to eat leafy green vegetables and stay away from dry beans, peas and corn. Eat all the vegetables you want along with your soup. At dinner, reward yourself with a big baked potato with butter. Do not eat fruit today.<br>  <br>  Day Three:<br>  Mix Days One and Two: Eat all the soup, fruits and vegetables you want.

Muscle mass=high weight/low reps. both kinds of muscle building require resting to repair. so working out the same muscle more than twice a week at the most, is pointless.|`|W7uP1ty4aa	As long as you don`t train the same muscle two days in a row you reduce your risk of overtraining. You should follow a two-day on, one day off schedule however. Higher reps, less weight, with lots of cardio and carb cutting will get you ripped if that`s what you`re looking for.|`|g3RysdKLaa	to defy your muscles you have to do more reps on less weight if you want to make them bigger then you do less reps and more weight.
ej6OdnDBaa	thats true <br>  your muscles need rest, because muscle growth and strength gain happen during the time the muscle is in rest, not during the time that you are working the muscle itself. Some people actually workout every day and see results, but most of them are experienced and theyve reached the point where they may not want to get any bigger,|`|8hIUOajLaa	Yes.<br>  Your body needs time to repair and grow, it cant do that if you constantly work that muscle. You may get stronger, but you will not see as much size.<br>  Muscle repair happens most when you sleep, so get plenty of rest and eat well, protein is your friend for weights.|`|vURKBxvWaa	if you are a biggener, you will see results, its called newbie gains.  your muscles are not used to lifting so it will get bigger quickly to compensate.  but after a while, your body will get used to it and will not get any bigger.<br>  <br>  and yes it is true, your body needs rest to grow.  muscles, in fact, do not grow while you are working out in the gym, but actually grow after, when you are resting.  when you are in the gym, your muscles are being torn apart by the stress of the heavy weights. so when you are resting, your body is rebuilding your muscles bigger and stronger to be able to handle the stress next time. so you generally want at least a day to rest each muscle. never work the same muscle 2 days in a row or else it will not have a chance to grow.|`|tkoyB5U3aa	Yes your muscles can "eat" themselves.<br>  Protein and rest = Results<br>  Do not over train!

Most of the exercises you listed aren't going to make you lose weight. Running 5 miles a week will help, and so will cutting calories|`|WBcBvufWaa	In all honesty. Focus more on Cardiovascular exercises such as running or find a sport that will make your heart pump faster than when your simply walking. Focus on a good diet, containing good source of protein. split up your meals to 5-6 times a day. eat every 2-3 hours just so that your not hungry don't eat to the point where you are full. And drink a lot of water. that will get you started well and on average you will start to see pounds melt away. Keep in mind that easily pounds may fluctuate by the muscle you build while your on a certain fitness plan. I recommend that you measure your  success by inches rather than pounds.|`|iy2o5lvEaa	It takes a deficiency of 3500 calories to lose one pound. It sounds like you'd burn around 2000 cals a week from working out. If you cut out around 200 cals or so a day from your diet, them expect to lose at least a pound a week.

If that doesn't help, he's got to prescribe you something stronger like Prevacid or Nexium.   Elevate the head of your bed about 4-6 inches so stomach juices drain down and not back and dont have any liquids a couple hours before bed.|`|rJRyVZhvaa	Go to a health food store and ask for digestive enzymes and DGL. (you can also look these up in the internet). The digestive enzymes break down your foods, and this will help with the nausea.<br>  You could also eat enzyme-rich fruits and vegetables, which will do the same thing, along with getting your vitamins and minerals.<br>  You may also have an imbalance in your metabolism, causing these symptoms.

UQWusO1waa	all i know about it is this. when your mind is used to being sedated/medicated is takes quite a while for it to get normal cycles reestablished. it is also a big problem for people who drink alcohol, then want to skip drinking alcohol for a few days, they cant fall asleep.Its a problem with all these mind altering drugs. they alter your mind. I glad you decided to kick the methadone addiction, you will Just have endure this re adaption to normalcy. just try to wear yourself  out so you will be sleepy tomorrow. Doctors don't want to tell you to stop al this drugging or their patients will find another doctor and not come back.You just have to suffer for a while, and tire yourself out until your mind can catch up .and get used to being un drugged. Im not preaching to you, just giving you some info to help you understand why you can`t sleep.

It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows?

d46e5bc188a340e7729a4bfdfb5ed476aa	you cant, its genetics|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	there is nothing we can do to alter out height|`|ZkwtldYlaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth .

Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain.

You should have done torture morning stretching exercises when you were younger. Coz its a fact that you are taller in the morning than in the later hours of the day.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|7w9zXLGMaa	drink lots of water when you feel hungry. wait a while... then eat :D lose weight and its good for your body.... but dont drink tooooo much or youll get water poison ofcourse.|`|BDxcP8gXaa	losing weight quick is taking carbohydrates out of your diet completely, but the minute you start introducing any carbs back into your diet (yes even the good ones... even ones from vegetables) you will balloon.

GT6396BDaa	Most doctors prescribe vicodin, either take 1 pill every 4-6 hours, or 2 pills every 4-6 hours.  I would not take more than the doctor orders.  If the medication is not relieving the pain, then call your doctor and ask if they can prescribe anything different for you.  <br>  Don't wait to take pain medication.  When you feel the pain coming, go ahead and take the medication.  The medication works much better.  If you wait until the pain level is too high the medication may not help.

Fish Fish Fish, high protein low fat. Also chicken and egg whites are also good sources.<br>  The protein helps repair muscle after a workout, hence making your muscles get the most post workout.<br>  Then once you have a good diet then add extra whey to become "buff" as you put it.<br>  And as for fat, fat makes you fat, so cut that down, but you need fat in your diet but stick to unsaturated fat!

Exercise right after you drink it. HOWEVER, do a lot of background research on the drink you're taking; some work, some can be deadly harmful.<br>  <br>  Also, don't have the shakes more than 2-3 times a week at the most . . . if you take them too much, your body gets used to the artificial creatine and stops producing it. Then, when you can't use them, you'll LOSE muscles fast.

NSARVXkMaa	Walking and treadmill exercise are great ways to lose weight. I incorporated the treadmill into my weight loss routine along with taking desert burn hoodia and honestly the weight started falling off. It's simple really, if you control your appetite and are eating less and you exercise more it's a great formula to drop as much weight as you desire. What I liked best about hoodia was that I didn't feel like I was dieting. It took away my hunger and I didn't feel all lightheaded and run down like can happen when you cut back caloric intake. I had plenty of energy and hiking was more enjoyable and effective as I lost my weight. Watching what you eat is great and it sounds like you just need to fine tune your approach to your weight loss. When I was dieting (and believe me I still watch my weight even though I have achieved my weight loss goals for the most part) I realized right off that the most important thing is to control your appetite. If your stomach's not always growling and your not always craving food it is sooo much easier to stick to your guns and stay on your diet. With hoodia I would literally go a whole day sometimes and simply forget to eat and I didn't get tired and run down like diets can sometimes make you feel. Once my appetite was under control and I wasn't always thinking about eating then and only then could the weight start coming off consistently and steadily because the hoodia kept my mind off of food and I would go longer on my diet and as I did that naturally I lost weight. You have to remember that consistency is very important when losing weight. If you cut back a little on your food consumption everyday your body will change (stomach will shrink and you won't be eating as much) and with that consistency over a few days, weeks and months you will lose weight just like I did and you will be in the best shape of your life like you desire!!! Hope this helps.|`|B12E4rYiaa	Eat 1500 calories or less and keep faithful track of it with a calorie chart. Keep track of all you eat and drink.

Exercise is always good and it's important to stay active but if when you get done you still binge eat or eat excessively then of course it will be more difficult to lose the weight you want to.

LPO8RlVdaa	Forget about losing weight. Just adopt a healthy lifestyle.Eat a good healthy diet and excercise a lot!!! The more excercise you do the better!<br>  <br>  For a healthy diet, you need to be eating small to medium meals regularly. 4 or even 5 times a day. Each meal (apart from breakfast which should preferably be fibre rich), should contain a balanced ammount of carbohydrates for energy, (from potatoes, rice and pasta, etc) protien (from fish, chicken, occassional red meat is fine, soya is good too) and plenty of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants (simple fresh fruit and veg). Eat like this and make sure you are well hydrated (fruit juice is as good as water, any fluid counts, but some fluids have negative effects too, such as alcohol or caffiene rich drinks.)<br>  <br>  Now for the science bit: Protien is essential for repairing muscle and keeping the muscle you do have healthy (this includes your heart, lungs, brain etc). You naturally lose the ammount of protien you have throughout the day (through urine etc) so this needs to be replenished regularly on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  Carbohydrates are essential for energy. You won't be able to function without it. It also regulates body fat and glucose etc.<br>  <br>  Vitamins and minerals are obviously essential for a variety of reasons. For normal growth and development, for the healthy maintenance of the cells, tissues, and organs that make up our bodies, and also to let us efficiently use chemical energy provided by food.<br>  <br>  You can have a wide range of healthy meals with this, from Thai, Chinese, Italian, British, Indian, etc. Just make sure each meal contains balanced ammounts of these three. On the bright side too, fresh veg and rice and pasta is a lot cheaper than crappy junk food!<br>  <br>  This doesn't mean you cant have chocolate or pizza/takeaway/etc, just save them as very occassional treats.<br>  <br>  The big secret to keeping a healthy weight and staying healthy is EXCERCISE, particularly cardio excercise. <br>  <br>  Cardio exercise includes any form of excercise such as running/jogging/swimming/cycling etc that gets your heart rate pumping and you sweating and out of breath. It will not only burn calories and reduce your body fat levels, therefore making you 'slimmer' by having less fat on you, but will also improve your resting heart rate and lung function, making you healthier. <br>  <br>  I cannot understate the importance of cardio excercise. It is this which will basically burn the body fat off you. <br>  <br>  But you have to remember that once you have shed a bit of fat you have to have a nice toned body underneath the fat to show off. <br>  <br>  Strength training will help you strengthen and tone your muscles. This is done with the use of weights or by free training.<br>  <br>  There are essentially (without getting overly complicated) two types of strength excercises based on different types of muscle fibres depending on wether you want to build size, bulk and power, or just 'tone' up the lean muscles an get more muscle endurance.<br>  <br>  Heavy weights with short reps/sets will build your fast twitch muscle fibres and build size, power and strength. Imagine big guys at the gym lifting heavy weights. <br>  <br>  But if you use light to medium weights with lots of reps/sets you will excercise your slow twitch muscle fibres, you wont build size, but you will tone up your body and train muscle endurance. This will obviously make you 'look' healthier and more toned, but will also increase your metabolism (as your muscles demand more energy) so you will burn calories faster. These muscles are also excercised a lot with cardio workouts (i.e your leg muscles when running).<br>  <br>  Your arms for example, will need bicep curls and tricep dips using weights and reps of your choice (heavy - low reps, light - lots of reps) and also shoulder excercises such as holding the weights at your waist and lifting them perpendicular to your side or in front of you, etc etc.<br>  <br>  Your stomach will need excercises that cover the entire torso. Leg raises for your lower ab wall, crunches, sit ups and planks for your upper and all over ab wall, oblique twists for your sides and superman stretches for your lower back for example.<br>  <br>  These are just basic examples, there are literally hundreds of excercises, but it is impossible to show you on a site like this, get a trainer at your gym to show you some but remember the basic rules of muscles and weights. <br>  <br>  As far as excercise goes, you should aim to strike a balance between cardio training and strength training, this way you will build good strong and toned muscle, but also keep your body fat levels down and increase your heart and lung performance, making you much fitter and healthier.|`|i4I0cuudaa	eat healthily but less; exercise more; answer is easy, doing it is more difficult in my experience|`|MEHpgZzZaa	dont think "fast"<br>  if you lose weight too fast, your skin wont be able to catch up to the shrinking. you'll have excess skin.<br>  healthiest? well, simple processed sugars should be in your diet as little as possible. fruits and veggies are a must, and stick to WHOLE grain breads, not multigrain. just keep it natural. <br>  they say weights are good for taking off fat and replacing them with fat burning muscle. as painful as it is, try running. outside.|`|rp7W4fE4aa	exercise & lay off the fast food.

The results were absolutely amazing.<br>  <br>  This was now over 2 years ago.  I have since then been able to maintain my weight with ease.<br>  <br>  Exercise is benefical regardless of your diet.  However, 80% of your physique is a result of what you eat.  20% is exercise.<br>  <br>  Continue to eat a balanced, low fat diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables.<br>  <br>  Keep all junk foods, ready made processed meals, sugary fizzy drinks, alcohol and takeaway meals to an absolute minimum.  These are high in sugar and full of sugar.  The two main ingredients which are responsible for that extra weight gain.<br>  <br>  Junk food is just what it says -  JUNK.  With one added ingredient in - FAT.<br>  <br>  Have three regular meals a day at regular times.  Always starting with breakfast.<br>  <br>  Learn how to choose, prepare and enjoy a balanced diet.  Low fat cooking skills, understanding food labels and having the ability to judge portion sizes all help with this.<br>  <br>  Sit down to eat your meals.  Take time over them and pay particular attention to what you are eating.<br>  <br>  Keep self-monitoring 'to stay conscious of your new eating and activity habits.  Try to move as much as you can.  Walking, cycling, swimming, using a jump rope, trampoline, climbing stairs.  All of these activies will help with your weight loss efforts.<br>  <br>  But one thing you have to remember is that.  Once you have reached your realistic target weight, if you go back to your old eating habits and activity levels.  Unfortunately, you will put all the weight back on again.  It really is as simple as that.<br>  <br>  Many slim people who stay that way by 'watching their weight' show flexible restraint, rather than following rigid all-or-nothing rules.  They make healthy choices most of the time, but no foods are forbidden.  <br>  <br>  I enjoy small amounts of my favourite foods still without feeling guilty.  And if I do over-indulge or have a big night out, I cut back a bit or do more exericse the next day to balance things out.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|tkoyB5U3aa	Too right it will. But if you fancy challenging yourself try interval training. That is running full out for a min then jogging for a min and so on as there is Research to suggest this helps burn more fat and can even still be working after you stop.<br>  <br>  Also from my experience when training for period longer than 20mins the weight loss levels are high assuming the diet stays good!|`|AnjIEVXKaa	the only way to loose weight is to burn off more calories than you take in. it has nothing to do with the length of time you exercise. you can exercise for 3 hours a day but if you take in more calories than you burned off in that 3 hour period you will gain weight.|`|yTNk4b7Raa	This may seem a little crazy D:<br>  im only 13 and im dieting, but i lie to call it '' healthy eating ''<br>  :) anyway, your supposed to aim for 30 mins exercise, 4 - 5 times a week. to maintain your weight. and your doing it 7 days a week!<br>  in order to lose weight, you have to eat less and do more.<br>  basically you eat less calories than your body needs to consume on a daily basis and do more. :)<br>  continue what your doing because i excercies about 4-5 hours a week sometimes not even that,, im on my second week and so far i've lost 5 1/2 lbs. good luck dude! :)|`|X8xFtWfJaa	YES
ZpKI9S25aa	okay this is gonna sound silly, but this is what I do..think in your head about the body you really want. Think about being able to shop where you want for clothes, not being restricted by your big size. Pretty much think about how much easier life would be when you're healthy...when I think about this, all I want to do exercise! lol hope I helped|`|u9NxzS1Uaa	i  just think about how great imma look when i start losing weight thats what keeps me motivated|`|xvtufc7faa	It's ok that you feel annoyed by the fact you have to run every day. Sometimes you're just tired of it because you know you gotta do it every day, but you don't wanna skip it because you really wanna lose weight, right? I had that problem. What I do is i change my exercises around. Like today i'm gonna run, tomorrow ill walk half and run half, then the next day i'll do some weight lifting, walk a little, and run a little. That way i'm doing mulitiple of things and still getting the exercises I need. Another way is don't just run on treadmill. If its nice out, run at a park or something. You'll feel the fresh air and feel more refresh and energetic. Also, have a positive mind. If you're getting lazy, go to your closet and take out a clothing item, and be like" i'm not going to be wearing this forever, i'll be fit and cute looking." That way you'll start to exercise more and keep yourself going. I hope these examples help you. Good luck and stay healthy!|`|y2Uks58paa	set a personal goal and a date on what you want to achieve it by. then make it your mission to do Absolutely whatever it takes to reach that goal. making a reward for yourself if you achieve your goal also helps.|`|AGTNTfsaaa	Try different exercises!

cku5S9WLaa	You're fine and within the healthy weight range.<br>  <br>  Edit: That's not healthy. You should be eating between 1200 and 1500 calories daily.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Your not fat but you could probably lose 10 pounds.|`|FaVYRoXqaa	You`re fine.  Do people know what a healthy weight is?|`|tB7GkTi5aa	If you are 5' 0" your ideal weight is 100 pounds. <br>  <br>  But this assumes that you lead a sedentary lifestyle and aren't particularly muscular. A mirror is really a better measure of how fat you are than a scale. <br>  <br>  Also, when you lose weight, you want to be sure you are losing only fat and not muscle or bone. Low calorie dieting causes loss of all three tissues. Not only is this unhealthy, but, because muscle is a metabolically active tissue, when you lose muscle you set yourself up to regain the weight you lost.<br>  <br>   I have a lot of information on this and on how to lose fat without losing lean tissue on my website if you are interested. <br>  <br>  <br>  B Schibly MD<br>  <a href="http://www.physicians-weight-loss-tips.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.physicians-weight-loss-tips.c...</a>|`|RzilBdJdaa	That is a bit much for someone who is only 5ft... you should be closer to 100-105 lbs. But it also depends on how old you are and your frame (bigger = can handle more weight and look skinny/ smaller = more weight loks fatter). If you wanna know if you're too skinny/fat, check out a BMI meter. You can Google it :)|`|vhTXHv3Eaa	If people think you look good, you should be more confident. Are you able to live a healthy lifestyle at your weight? If you are, then there is no point in losing it. I would however, recommend that you make healthy choices in your diet if you do not already.|`|PIQaTuAZaa	you are defo right weight for your height with a BMI of only 23.4<br>  <br>  if you want to see fat look at the pics i posted on my last question, well people seem to think i am fat that what they said
deYDbVDSaa	Anything that is saltly is best avoided. Look at the labels for sodium content. You should eat no more than 2400mgs per day.
B12E4rYiaa	There is no reason to eat more every persons body is different so you the rules will change a bit for everyone if you feel good and like it as it is and it's working for you don't worry about it. <br>  <br>  If it's not broke don't fix it.|`|ySB6dZYlaa	What are you trying to accomplish by uping calories? you seem fine like you are unless you want to build more mass.|`|z4Redcm8aa	If you have been doing this for a while, then your body is probably already used to this. I am guessing you have a smaller frame if your only 120lbs. Doctors never recommend that you go under 1200 calories a day (unless there are medical purposes) So if I were you I would at least try to stay in the 12-1300 calorie range, so your body doesn't go into starvation mode!|`|uCxYdyQXaa	You seem to be in perfect shape to me ... I wouldn't really bother, if I were you. As long as you're fit, healthy and happy. :)
I38WF5aFaa	Work with your own body weight as resistance.  Your pull up bar can work your biceps and many muscles in the back.  If you change your grip and how far your hands are spread apart it will work different muscles.  <br>  Push ups can work your chest and triceps.  If you do them with your feet on a chair to change the angle it will work your shoulders.  <br>  If you can find a way to do dips it will work many upper body muscles.  Try it between 2 dining room chairs.<br>  Legs are a little harder to work without additional weight.  Toe raises work the calves.  Squats and lunges work the butt and quads.  If it gets too easy work one leg at a time.  You can use a step to shake things up and work different parts of the muscle.<br>  Keep proper form for all exercises.  Work for full range of motion,  don't forget to stretch.  Some aerobic exercise on the off days will help with endurance and is a great way to burn fat.  When your own body weight is not enough resistance to challenge you try adding free weights,  but not until then.<br>  Gaining weight and building muscle takes proper nutrition.  I am not a big believer in supplements.  Just eat quality food and make sure to get enough calories to replace what you burn.|`|biMINS1Eaa	push ups, sit ups, pull ups, squats|`|E4AS8eAHaa	dear 19 year old ,  1st of  all , i need u to have a positive mind-set , nope, dont get up , stay in ur chair , and grasp both ur hands together and feel the muscles tighten , now stand up and do 10 seconds of 'shadow-boxing" by this time ur all fired up and ready for the next step , the sacred untouched style of " Calisthenics Exercising" . now grasp both hands in a fist once again, or here's sum references u might find useful    <a href="http://www.expertvillage.com/video-series/83_calisthenics.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.expertvillage.com/video-serie...</a> . remember always , ur in control , u have the energy within you . hope tat helps , regards , austin
fecUjSr1aa	take it from an ex ... ex-smoker that it .. the chest pains are part of the fact you've had too much smoke in your lungs and it has affected you. I suggest, now that you quit, start walking ... start with a mile, around the neighborhood, leisurely walk and take your time. document it - yes, put it in writing .. day one - walking - one mile .. this is your starting point.<br>  <br>  in a couple of days, do the same mile but walk a bit faster, now, how long did it take you? jot that down too .. sort of see how you are progressing. and then next week, perhaps you could go 2 miles .. any improvement?<br>  <br>  and then walk / jog .. walk 200 feet, jog 200 feet, walk again and then jog again. after a few days.. walk 200 feet, jog 400 feet .. walk again, make your walking your rest periods. and then, if you feel like it, jog farther and farther than before. like i said, jot it down so you can see the progress. and before you know it ..you jogging 3 miles non-stop. that's how i did it ... i've recently went 5 miles, non-stop .. slow jog yes, but hey, i couldn't even walk a mile when i was smoking ..<br>  <br>  your move and great .. you're off the habit ... keep it up ..|`|B12E4rYiaa	Start out with exercises that are not intense like Yoga and Pilates so that you will be working out, but still relaxed gradually you can work your way up to more strenuous types of exercise. Take it easy at first don't push it the body needs time to adjust. You will do it just be patient. Good luck|`|axUpa0mtaa	You can start off with light workouts and go walking or jogging in the park. Its also best to go with a buddy because having conversations while walking can sometimes distract you from the walking and you eventually go further without knowing it. Also, when you get winded place your hands on top of your head and take in deep breaths, never bend over from the waist this doesn't help out at all. Placing your hands on your head helps expand the lungs and increases oxygen intake and therefore better breathing to help increase the workout routine. This helps because your chest is being stretched and your lungs do too. You'll definitely tell the difference in no time. Also lots of water before working out and proper stretches before and after.

I don't think your body can produce enough protein to maintain or even to build up muscles, that's why you need foods or every kind of supplement.<br>  <br>  and i don't think it is good for runners, because whey protein is for those people who want to have bigger muscles. it won't do anything to you if you just go running everyday, though it would somehow strengthen your thigh muscles.|`|wwRbkCMraa	Whey protein can definitely help improve your recovery and aid in tissue repair.  It can also help build your immune system.  Don't worry about side affects.

de61674560750ca671798a74d4f68053aa	Are you a complete beginner trying to do work outs?<br>  <br>  Well, as you know, if you want to get in shape, you need to train your body.<br>  <br>  And first of all, you need to do cardiovascular exercises every day for at least 30 minutes (preferably 45 minutes) and you should do it before working out. Cardios such as running, jogging, swimming, rope jumping are great.<br>  <br>  Then here comes to the work out part. So basically I just give you a work out generator first and then you can try to use it to generate your workout routine.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.menshealth.co.uk/base/workout..." rel="nofollow">http://www.menshealth.co.uk/base/workout...</a><br>  <br>  And you should do the work outs EVERY OTHER DAY to let your body to take a rest, to recover. But when it comes to the day that you don't need to work out, keep in mind that you still need to do cardio. And as for how many sets and reps (repetitions), well it depends on how many times you can lift. If you are already physically strong, you may want to add more weight when you are lifting. Basically you should at least do 3 sets in every work out, and have a determined reps in it. When you are tired of the sets and reps, you can always add more weight or increase the sets and reps as much as you want. But don't overdo it.<br>  <br>  And if you have soreness after the first day working out, it is completely normal. It means that you've never used that part of your body and the work outs you do made it tensed. So don't worry if you are gonna have this situation. Just leave your body for a rest and you will be fine.<br>  <br>  And as for what to eat. Well every kind of food with high PROTEIN helps. Those foods are milk, eggs; fishes like tuna or any other kinds of fishes; and lean meat like chicken, turkey; and vegetables like nuts, every kind of nuts. Or like you may notice that there's a product for working out called WHEY PROTEIN SHAKE, and this is actually really helpful for people who work out and try to have big muscles (bulk up). And remember that you should have your meal and drink the whey protein shake right after your work out is over. And remember to get enough sleep, and drink at least 8 glasses of water to hydrate your body, and keep doing your workout routine.<br>  <br>  <br>  Well I think it's pretty much it and yeah this is a very long journey and sorry for spending your time in reading this.<br>  <br>  So just keep doing it and you'll get there.<br>  <br>  All the best to you!|`|8SRjELNBaa	To maintain your current weight by doing nothing but sitting on your butt, you need 2,022 calories. (this is your RMR).<br>  <br>  This worked for me;<br>  Eat 1500 calories a day, do high-intensity-interval-training in the morning for 20 minutes.  Don't be intmidated by the name, its just fancy for "sprint & rest".  (Google search: HIIT)<br>  <br>  Do some running in the evening too... <br>  <br>  High protein, high fiber diet. lots of water.|`|f05TawR0aa	Replace taking the bus/subway with walking or cycling - a little change like that can shift a lot of weight. Find exercise that you like doing rather than something that is a chore (for example you could get into swimming or martial arts). When you begin working out start with something that doesn't strain you too much and then increase the intensity with successive workouts. Also, to ensure you have the energy needed to work out make sure you get lots of sleep, drink lots of water and have a snack high in protein and carbohydrates about an hour before your workout. I'd say you should shoot for about 2000 calories per day depending on how much you work out. If you feel like you need it, have a cheat day every fortnight or so - grabbing a pizza with friends and taking a break from the treadmill can help keep you sane and make your diet seem more manageable.<br>  <br>  I also highly recommend mixing weight training up with your cardio. Building muscle mass will not only give you a better shape but it will also speed up your metabolism.<br>  <br>  Have a calorie deficit of just 500 calories per day and you will definitely be in shape by the time you get to prom. Good luck!|`|r59SRbKIaa	You need one hour a day. One.<br>  <br>  Do some Yoga to loosen up, some strength training to get in shape, but spend most of your time running.<br>  <br>  I hate running.

Cut out the garbage (candy, cola, etc.) You can have some of these, the problem is we always go to excess.<br>  <br>  The big deal is the intake control . . and running.

EWWW<br>  <br>  <br>  your daily intake should be 1500-1700 calories a day.
I38WF5aFaa	That's a lot of weight in a short time.  You know the answer,  burn more calories than you take in.  How can you reduce your caloric intake?  Do you drink soda or other sugar filled beverages?  Switch to water or unsweetened tea. <br>   Do you eat a lot of fried food including chips?  What about fast food or any restaurant meals?  At home do you eat a lot of factory made foods?  Cooking from scratch is more healthy and less expensive. That includes taking a homemade lunch to work.  The money you save can buy the smaller clothes you will need.  <br>  <br>  Burning calories doesn't need to be complicated.  Walking and riding a bike are the easiest ways.  Start with 1/2 mile three times a week.  Increase the distance when that gets too easy.  Park further from the door,  both at home and at the store.  Those few extra steps add up.  How about doing your own yard work and gardening?  That works different muscles and burns calories.  It also adds to a feeling of accomplishment.  If you want to go to the gym,  that's OK too.  <br>  <br>  Now comes the hard part that makes the most difference.  It doesn't make much difference what you do as long as its sensible,  but if you don't stick with it,  it won't work.  Best of luck to you.

9EAIMt0Baa	Depends. Do you have a weak/strong metabolism. If you have a strong metabolism you will need lots of food (mostly protein and carbs). <br>  <br>  If you have a low metabolism then that looks like your diet may be ok. <br>  And as for the exercise 6 times a week, that is overkill. Your body will only grow and develop muscle if you give it time to heal. 5 days a week is a good way to go. <br>  <br>  The caffeine, sweets, and bag of chips are irrelevant if you can burn them off. If you are concerned about gaining weight then avoiding just those won't do the trick. Other foods like breads have very high calorie counts that can easily put on the pounds if you can't burn them off. <br>  <br>  Your weightlifting strategy is good. But its not about weightlifting 3 times a week, its about making sure you hit all the groups and not replicating two groups right after the other. It's ok if you weightlift every day as long as one day you perform shoulders for instance, arms, legs, chest, back, etc. While the back is exercising, the legs are healing for example.<br>  <br>  And one more thing. Dude, were in an economic recession. If you afford to only have fast food once a week, then I guess you're mr. money bags cause 5 bucks a day for food is all I can afford. Fast food is not horrible if you buy decent things. Big Macs = bad. Taco Bell tostadas = not bad.|`|r59SRbKIaa	Drop the chips and fast food. Fast food is GARBAGE. Seriously. Next time you stop by McDonalds, actually READ the carcinogen warning on the fries containers. You may not get cancer from it, but still . . . it's GARBAGE.<br>  <br>  Instead, spend your money on things you know are good for you. A $5 bag of almonds. $10 worth of oranges, apples, kiwi, papaya . . . . or take your pick.

73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	No- it won't hurt a bit.  Baby teeth don't have the root structure an adult tooth has,  so it'll probably pop right out of there if the dentist needs it removed. He/she will use novocaine and numb the area anyways, so you don't need to worry.   My son still has a baby molar (he's 20 yrs old) - the permanent tooth under it never formed - and so far it's doing fine. The dentist said to just leave it be unless it "needs" to come out, so that's what he's doing.|`|YkD4Pf2Raa	i had a baby tooth out two years ago. i can honestly say the injection was the most painful part, and my tooth was at the front. i've heard the injections hurt less at the back. when they actually pull the tooth, you can feel a bit of pressure but it doesn't actaully hurt, and it's a bit horrible when you can hear your tooth cracking away from your roots.|`|4jCPVhYSaa	Don't worry at all, unless you live in a third world country your doctor will give you an anesthetic ( a shot) and before he puts in the needle he'll desensitize the area with an anesthetic cream and you shouldn't feel a thing. Once the anesthetic becomes active (usually within 15 min) you won't feel a thing when he pulls the tooth.|`|4CgYIHWYaa	I've had 4 baby teeth out and they didn't hurt at all. Most of the time they come out very easily and easier for those which are wobbly. The injection can be uncomfortable but sometimes they can give you numbing gel which helps not feel it. I hate the dentist but this was fine.

Eat fruit and take a supplement.|`|XZqSO94saa	You can start by maybe including 1 cup of orange or fruitjuice if you don't mind those.<br>  You can also make a smoothie/ milkshake if those (banana, blueberries, strawberries, 125mL icecream, 1/2 cup milk, etc...<br>  It doens't have to be all vegetable's. Aslong as you're getting an appropriate ammount of fruit that's great!<br>  <br>   Do you happen to like soups?<br>  Knor has a cool new soup line of colored vegetable soups.<br>  yellow soup for 1 serving of yellow vegetables<br>  green soup for 1 serving of green vegetables<br>  red, orange, and more!<br>  Those might be a good-idea and they taste great, and more creamy and cheesy than anything. Not really like veggie's.<br>  <br>  Hope i'v helped. And keep eatting tomatoe's and such as sauses on pastas in sandwhich'es, tomatoe juice, baked potatoes, roasted potatoes/ mashed etc...<br>  <br>  Goodluck!|`|PPoyjq3Vaa	Well it depends on if you just don't like other vegetables, or if you absolutely hate other vegetables.   It's hard to eat something you hate.<br>  <br>  But if you just plain don't like them....  then just change the form of them into something else you do like.  <br>  <br>  There is a raw option, and a cooked option.<br>  <br>  You can gather the vegetables that are tolerable to you, then chop them up into very small cubes.   I mean really super small cubes.   Then throw the cubes into a cup and cover it with either a salad dressing or a yogurt or a combination of both, and eat it that way.<br>  <br>  Or..    take the vegetables you can tolerate, and then put them in a frying pan with some canola oil and fry them. If you like garlic then add that too.   Add a seasoning you like.  I like soy sauce added at that point.     Fry them for a long time, but not burning them too much.  Burn them a little though.   The flavor of the oil and seasoning will soak thru to the middle of the vegetables.  Then wipe or strain the excess oil out, and eat it that way... or put it between bread and make it into a sandwich.   I like it in a sandwich.|`|vhTXHv3Eaa	You can take supplements. They have them at grocery stores and health stores. They are made for people that do not eat enough veggies. <br>  You could have spinach on your sandwiches. It is very nutritious. Just try to incorporate nutritious veggies into things that you do like.|`|Q1PczvzKaa	What i read you can do is sneak them in .<br>  Say your making meatloaf , try grinding (finely) some carrots and sneaking them in . You will barely taste it ! Also , you can go to the store and buy 1 of EVERY vegetable and try them ALL to see which arent so bad.<br>  <br>  Well Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Sara|`|25Whzu2waa	Ok, try integrating it into food that you like. If you like pasta, try slicing/chopping some greens (brocolli/green beans) and mixing it into a tomato sauce. If you have pizza, try ordering spinach pizza (once) and eat it. You'll get accustomed to the taste after a while.<br>  <br>  Not saying you'll grow to like it (some do), but at least have it. The fact that you know you should have them is a step in the right direction. ^_^|`|FhgXyDlkaa	I don't know any specific dishes but look up some healthy meals that include veggies but in a way where it's tasty and you can barely tell the veggies are in there. :]

Zxcvtmwraa	In the simplest terms, your body has become immune to the hormones that your thyroid produces. Your body is trying to make up for this by making a crazy amount of hormones, which is not good for your body.<br>  <br>  It's possible that you might need to have your thyroid removed by radiation...If that happens, you will have to take a pill for the rest of your life that makes a synthetic thyroid hormone. It's also possible that your thyroid could make a recovery but it depends on your body.<br>  <br>  I went through something like this when I started college and it was the roughest days of my life. I was very fortunate and got to keep my thyroid. Best of luck to you.

fecUjSr1aa	Gee, what kind of results are you looking for? If I could do that time you spend on pilates, I'd be a happy camper ...<br>  <br>  you do all these exercises like all in a day you're exercising? amazing !! the fact that you have the energy to finish all that you say you're doing, is results enough, you have the stamina for it, good cardio exercise. couldn't ask for more.<br>  <br>  however ... it looks like there's not stopping you so don't ..you could incorporate jogging with your physical activity .. once or 2x a week, since like you said, you're not trying to lose weight.

AA10017170	Losing weight fast is rarely a good idea but if you're insistent on it then I can advise the following:<br>  <br>  Eat only fruit and vegetables for a week.<br>  No meat.<br>  No fat.<br>  No sugary drinks or food.<br>  <br>  Plain vegetables and fruit. The first thing you'll notice is a rapid drop in weight through water loss (3-4lbs). The increase in fibre will help detox you.<br>  <br>  Personally I'd recommend a good diet and exercise program. My website details a diary of how I went for 50 days doing a range of training and eating well. I lost 14lbs and became a lot more lean and healthy. On top of that I'll keep the weight off because of the better lifestyle.|`|Ykzx3OVfaa	-Meals: Firstly, get RID of temptation. Don't let your mom buy you chips anymore. Don't even walk into a McDonald's for lunch. <br>  Buy healthy low calorie low fat foods. Drink lots of water to fill yourself up so you'll eat less during meals. Have fruit or veggies as snacks, and switch from white bread to whole grain. Buy dairy in skimmed, low fat selections. <br>  For breakfast, try oatmeal, fruit, low fat yogurt, or a healthy cereal. <br>  For lunch, have a whole wheat pita stuffed with chicken and lettuce, salads, white meat, brown bread sandwiches, and fish. <br>  For dinner, try fish, chicken, bison (tastes like beef but much leaner), and have lots of veggies. Give up soda and sugary drinks.<br>  <br>  -Exercise: Cardio, cardio, cardio is the most important thing for losing weight. Strength training is important as well, but cardio is your fat-burning furnace. Try to get in 20-30 minutes of cardio (biking, running, ellyptical, etc) per day. Alternate strength training for every other day. For example, run every day for a week but only lift weights, do crunches, etc, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.<br>  <br>  That's all there is to it. It sounds easy enough but you need to want it and have the willpower and drive to follow through with the plan. It's the only way to get fast results.|`|6FOKld0uaa	well i think you should quit worrying about weight, and worry about how you feel.<br>  Im sure youre a very nice girl :)<br>  What you should do is cut out processed foods, sugar, and salt.

Depends on your age, primarily - if you are 15 it is too much, but if you are 55 then it is OK.<br>  <br>  Weight is something that cannot really be quantified as an absolute - not everyone who is 5-7 "should" weigh the same.<br>  <br>  There is a lotta crap about "big bones" that is meaningless.

If you are a weight lifter, or a football lineman then it is OK.  But you are probably overweight.<br>  <br>  If you are a normal young girl then you are fat, with rolling chins, and a muffin-top over your jeans.

Y4ogWjHOaa	Kevin sweetheart the answer is so simple that you probably would never see it yourself.<br>  <br>  You have actually answered your own question yourself.<br>  <br>  Firstly your cardiology tests always come back NAD (No abnormalities detected) So we know it isn't your heart going wrong.<br>  <br>  So think about it, you  always get these palpitations when you have had a period of smoking and then stopped. They start to ease off and then you smoke again and when you stop they come back more severely. Then you start smoking again and they disappear, then you stop and they come back again.<br>  <br>  What is happening is that smoking chills you out and your entire body relaxes and you couldn't give a damn about anything. When you stop, the body reacts by getting back into anxiety mode and so the palpitations return..<br>  <br>  As the body starts to recover and you start to be more relaxed without the aid of smoking, the attacks ease off a little.<br>  <br>  Then you smoke again, you get all chilled out again and so you have no problem. Then you stop again and you are back to square one.<br>  <br>  It is purely an adjustment problem. If you stay off of it you will notice that gradually the palpitations will stop altogether, unless you start to smoke again, then the withdrawal will begin all  over again.<br>  <br>  It is a bit like someone being in a desperate situation at home for example looking after a sick loved one, trying to make ends meet financially, being scared to open the mail for fear of what bills have turned up, trying to hold down a job, while juggling the cooking, cleaning, washing, and still having to be able to be a carer for the sick relative.<br>  <br>  While this person is in the ongoing situation they are coping and are so used to the stress that they just carry on.<br>  <br>  Then take that person out of that situation.. They suddenly are offered a three week holiday all paid for and someone is prepared to look after the relative, so this person is going to be absolutely and totally worry free for three weeks.<br>  <br>  When they return  to the reality of the situation after their three weeks away from it, it is going to take them a good while to get back into routine and feel that they  can cope once again. They are actually going to feel worse by having been away from it and now having to face it all again, than they would have done if they had just kept plodding along as they were.<br>  <br>  I am sorry that was a bit long winded, but I just wanted you to    understand what I am trying to tell you.<br>  <br>  When your body is just getting used to coping by itself, it gets a holiday again because you smoke...everything is lovely. Then you stop and it has to cope with the sudden normality of everything and it causes you to get what are essentially panic attacks.<br>  <br>  This will pass and you will be absolutely fine, there is nothing medically wrong with you, if there was the ECG etc: would have shown it up.<br>  <br>  Just settle and realise it is nothing to freak out about. the sooner you can manage that, the sooner it will stop.<br>  <br>  I have seen this type of thing happen so many times for various reasons, but the results are the same.<br>  <br>  So calm down, understand what is happening, understand that you have no reason to fear it and get on with your life.<br>  <br>  I know I have rambled on but I hope it has helped.<br>  <br>  Love Mel.X|`|p0e9jh79aa	wtf are you worried adout,your doctor said you are okay.stop being a big wuss|`|g3IKGbr1aa	its your blood pressure meds. talk to your doctor to have them changed very common side effect.

JsiELu6xaa	Tolerance to smoking varies from strain to strain and has a lot to do with quantity being consumed. Say someone is taking in an average of 2 joints a day. Now if he is smoking anything that had its picture in high times, chances are he will not build up a tolerance for sometime. However if he were to increase his quantity to say....4 or 5 joints a day, he would probably stop feeling as high when he smoked after say...the fourth day. But if someone was smoking some cheap weed, and say about 2 or 3 joints a day, they would probably stop feeling as high in say a week. But it is all very subjective and varies from strain to strain, person to person, and quantity to quantity. But to answer your question as simply as possible. If you are smoking the same kind of bud daily for a week, you will probably develop some tolerance to that strain. you will still get high, but you will need to smoke more to get to the same place you did at the beginning of the week.|`|FgPZ8Sl8aa	I don't think Zach has ever used weed or he would know that is completely false. <br>  <br>  Tolerance is a weird thing, there is no exact amount or time that it takes to build tolerance. Usually someone who only smokes on the weekends would never build up a large tolerance, but it also depends on how much they smoke.<br>  <br>  I smoke nearly everyday but I've tried to keep my tolerance and a minimal level because, let's face it, who likes to spend more money on it than they have to. So I always pace my smoking and let the high hit me. It's the people that smoke huge bong load and large blunts that try to smoke an impossible amount that build a tolerance fast. That's mostly a younger person thing however. It's kind of like the younger folks that drink alcohol, they like to show and that they drank an entire case of beer to themselves. But the responsible users understand there is no point in being so excessive.<br>  <br>  I've been smoking nearly every day for a couple years and 1/8th an ounce still lasts my wife and I over a week and sometimes 2. Sometimes I suppose I take a week or so off and that might help maintain a bit of a lower tolerance.|`|2A7UTkHtaa	Well...I'm not too sure what school Zach goes to but he's getting false information. Marijuana is hard to get a specific tolerance because there are so many different branches of it. Even a stoner who's been smoking relativily strong stuff every day for a couple years could get his hands on some really good stuff and get really high off one bowl. But usually you won't maintain a high tolerance at all if you're not smoking every single day. If my tolerance gets too high I take a couple weeks off and that usually lowers it.|`|468e3388bbbf4fd324adef4fcb6c509baa	Smoking marijuana has like a reverse tolerance. The more you smoke, the less it takes you to get high. And the more you smoke you learn how to control yourself better while you are high.
e7ace19383856f6361f6f85be215c636aa	It could be you have a sleeping disorder.  One sleeping disorder that comes to mind is Sleep Apnea.  It can cause you to sleep and never feel fully rested.    You have to have a sleep study done in order to find out if you have a sleeping disorder of any kind.

Or at least feeling tired.<br>  <br>  Medicines can cause sleepiness.  Neurological medicines are the worst offenders at causing sleepiness, but others can as well.  Each person can respond to medicines differently at different doses so someone else's response to a medicine or even your own response at a lower dosage is not a good reference.<br>  <br>  You are sick with something.  The body often shuts down partly to allow it's built-in systems to work on the problem.<br>  <br>  I would look first at stress and changes in medicines.  Medicines can also build up to toxic levels in your body due to unexpected interactions with other medicines or foods you have eaten.  In some cases eating grapefruit with some neurological medicines can cause it to be the equivalent of a MUCH greater dose than expected.|`|SNNPVzYvaa	could you be over-doing yourself in other ares of your life e.g school/college/work?<br>  also i think if you over-sleep or aren't used to a regular sleeping pattern, this could mess-up your 'body clock'<br>  otherwise go and check with your doctor/GP-they should be able to help more :)|`|e3zscIXjaa	Some people need more sleep than others.

4b8MLoJNaa	There are many techniques. The most important thing is to work your pull-ups often. Here are some strategies:<br>  <br>  Assisted pull-ups are one strategy. You can purchase some fitness tubing or bands and loop them over the bar and under your knees to help to minimize the load you are lifting. You can also bend your knees behind you and get a buddy to assist you by lifting your shins/feet. Alternatively you can use the 'gravitron' machine that many gyms have or you can use the lat pulldown station. Although you may find that these don't really help that much since they don't mimic the natural motion your body will use when doing a real pull-up.<br>  <br>  Try switching grips. The further your hands are spread out the more difficult it will be. You may also find that a grip where your hands are facing you will offer you more power since you are bringing more bicep into the mix.<br>  <br>  A controversial technique (in the bodybuilding world anyway) that will help you is to try the kipping pull-up. This is less of a 'bodybuilding' pull-up and more of a gymnastics type pull-up. It will help you build the explosive power you need to do pull-ups well. You can find free vids to teach you how at the following link. Check out "adrian teaches kipping 1,2 & 3" for sure and there are many others as well.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/excercis..." rel="nofollow">http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/excercis...</a>|`|AA10182949	lie on the floor with a secure bar directly above your chin at arm length and pull yourself up.|`|VXQFT341aa	Try push-ups too.

Spill everything, tell him how you needed a man and he was chosing the drugs over his family and you needed to talk to a man that is willing to listen. You'll probably never forgive yourself.

At the same time drink at least 2 litres of water a day and always use the stairs whenever posible. Eat at least 1 apple and 1 banana a day and increase the amount of milk you drink. If you want a quick burst of weight loss you will need some help. I got some Acai Berry free at <a href="http://linkbee.com/ITRR" rel="nofollow">http://linkbee.com/ITRR</a> and I used that and saw about 20lbs come off very fast using all these thngs together. Good luck!|`|8m48DCWkaa	It is important but any exercise in general is good exercise.  The idea of muscle confusion will help you burn weight faster in the long run.<br>  <br>  Let's say for example you bike 30m every day at the same speed each time.  Your body will progressively adapt to this daily routine and adjust itself to exercise more efficiently.  If you change the exercises every so often or even just vary the speeds it prevents your body/heart from getting used to the current exercise.  Keeping your body and heart always adapting and changing will require more energy and burn more calories.  The idea is the same for building muscle, eventually you reach a plateau if you repeat the exact same work out routines over and over, you will still burn calories or gain mass at this plateau, just it will not be as efficient as if you had changed up the routines.<br>  <br>  As for working different areas of muscles, that's completely up to you.  Cardio and weight lifting in general is always good for weight loss, if you want a well rounded physique then you should definitely vary up the routines.  You could try a Taebo/Kenpo, or Yoga routine along with biking.  Jumping rope is always a good exercise assuming you push yourself hard enough and get your heart rate up.  The dumbbells will allow you to work your upper body and arms through various types of curls or shoulder exercises.  <br>  <br>  hope this helps

(All they do is therapy is for exampe put your hoodies on the left and make you see it haha).<br>  <br>  I dont think itll be on your record.

WIeCX71Daa	Nah, I'm just trying to petition my Gyno for a hysterectomy......why bleed when I'm never gonna have any more babbies. He's not exactly all for it yet, but give me time, I can talk a tiger into giving me his raw meal.<br>  <br>  I will win eventually<br>  <br>  EDIT. I have three babbies and was hospitalised with all of them to go on a drip. As much as I'm clucky over everyone elses kids, 3 is a smidge more than I can handle. I was sick for 6 months with all of them, had a good month then got bad fluid retention. I'm SO done with babbies too. It also took me 10 years and a miscarriage to get my daughter, another 20 something months and another miscarriage to get my son, then oopsie, Um my last babby was conceived without even trying, lol. Definitely no more here.|`|ewps7rb7aa	I had it done May 2008|`|rFxLHqQFaa	I had a WONDERFUL experience with Essure.<br>  <br>  I bought car insurance through them.|`|JK2RvliYaa	I have no kids & i'm not putting out till after menopause.|`|PeoOb4aHaa	I had my tubes tied, and it hurt like a *****.
AA10316778	My neighbor put one of those round Dr Scholl's corn thingys on his. I'm not sure how long he had to keep it on...but the skin tag just fell off.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	A lot depends on how big it is. If it is large, a doctor is best.<br>  <br>  If it is relatively small, here is how I have done it.<br>  * Swab the area with rubbing alcohol.<br>  * Take a pair of curved nail scissors (they are very sharp) and, while stretching the skin tag taught, cut as close to the base as you can.<br>  * Use cotton or some gauze to staunch the blood.<br>  * Cover with some antibiotic cream (neosporin or similar) and cover with a bandaid.<br>  *Continue to treat like any other shallow cut (keep clean, etc.)|`|svR4WPZpaa	Yes, you can cut them off with scissors or fingernail clippers. I had someone cut off one on my neck. It takes a little nerve but no sense in going to a doctor for something so simple.<br>  <br>  It might help to put some baby gum numbing medicine on it first. It hurts about like ear piercing or even less.|`|ZI8Z2NT9aa	ive done it before...i boiled some surgical scissors in water and rubbed alcohol on it.  then i tried to ice it down.  it hurt like heck but it was very uncomfortable.  it hurt really bad when i did it, but the bad pain was gone for a little while, and it bled for about 10-15 min. but after that everything was a-ok.  just make sure whatever you use is sterile and you sterilize the area/tag that you are removing
eMW9a5JBaa	aww..i feel so bad for you!! but..chances are that the nerve is expose! if that's the case..you need to do a root canal to stop the pain..but..is expensive, after the root canal you will need a crown to protect the tooth. is going to cost a lot of money! but if you can go to a dental school, they might do it for free.|`|pGBTHEjtaa	you really need to see a dentist or have the teeth pulled.|`|iWat12yFaa	Maybe this website will help!

fedcc566951e3efb40fc6b8571756901aa	Call your doctor who has seen you and ask him since he has seen for himself and will have better and more reliable advice than anyone on yahoo answers can. Even if someone claims to be a dr on here, you just don't know and it's not worth your health.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, I wouldn't stress about it too much, this has happened to me before and when you clear up a sinus infection, you might get rid of the infection itself, but you still have to get rid of all the phlegm your body created, so you should have drainage and that's usually a good sign although sometimes it can take a while to go away. The difficulty breathing/cough/runny nose can be a sign of this drainage, but if it's really laborious to breathe, obviously you need to see a dr again pretty fast. You will know when it's getting bad if it does, it won't be an annoying wheeze, but will kind of scare you....go right away if this happens. You can't get well if you can't breath properly. The headache could easily be from profuse drainage as well. <br>  <br>  If you're not stressing about it too bad, try taking some OTC decongestant and a pain reliever to help with the drainage and see if that doesn't help alleviate some of your discomfort. If you are feeling SICK again, and suspect the infection itself has not gone away, you need to see a dr immediately, and they will have to put you on more serious antibiotics or a different medication altogether. Definitely look out for stiffness of the neck as well, that's a bad bad sign. If you get that go to the ER right away.<br>  <br>  That's the best advice that can be given on the internet, but only the doctor who saw you or another in person doctor should give you a real analysis and tell you what you should do, so take some OTC meds tonight, hydrate, rest, keep your head elevated when you sleep, and call him asap for further advice. Then go from there. I find in most cases with sickness if you're really in bad shape, your body will let you know when it's time to act. Until then, be sure to take excellent care of yourself and give your body a chance to normalize.|`|Q2dJhKJraa	I had the same problem, but i dont have insurance, and when i got sick i figured it would get better, never did, instead i had to make four doctor visits includding a specialist...Go to the hospital...its better, ive been sick for about a month as soon as i saw a specialist i felt sooo mcuh better. <br>  if you have insurance, go ahead dont let it get worse and have it interfere with you life.

mAp90hEeaa	Without a doctor looking at your eye under the black light, it will be difficult to tell if this might be a corneal abrasion which will look different that poison ivy which will show blistering when they look.

A corneal abrasion often heals itself within 24 hours, poison ivy will not.|`|fZGcufB7aa	I'm sorry you haven't gotten any answers yet. <br>  <br>  1. It could be.

J6Ksn0P7aa	Hot compresses for as long as you can stand it, if it comes to a head then you can pop it with a clean, sterilized needle. If it does not have an obvious head squeezing will only make it worse.   My favorite product is the new Benzoyl peroxide acne products that have recently come out, Clean and Clear has one.  I can usually take care of my boils over night with this stuff.
b8a51f5098090ab33a464a74631f3bd9aa	Masturbating is very normal & a natural thing, it's not a substitute for a girlfriend and definitely not a clue that you are in need of a girlfriend. Most guys start masturbating in there teens, some of us earlier and will continue to do it even after the teenage years. When I was around your age, even younger, I was the same... I would jerk 3-4, if not more times a day and I am now 34 and still do so.  I am single at the time but when I was dating, I would jerk every now & then and was also having sex. I know some guys that are married have sex at least once or twice a week yet they still like to jerk once in a while to release some pressure or stress. If you can handel jerking off 2-3 times a day or more then good for you, continue doing what you like without worrying if it means that you are in need of a girl or sex or any other pleasures. Nothing nor no one can tell you if or when you need a girlfriend... only you will now when and if you're ready for one.|`|whDp8gj0aa	It is an issue where science and religion collide. People in the medical field say it is natural, while conservative people and religious authorities say it is an infatuation of someone and an abuse to the body which is considered important and holy to some. Do you do this because you are not getting a girlfriend at all? If you do, then that means that you do this as a way to get an experience of something that only happens when two lovers, a boyfriend and a girlfriend, do after they get married; therefore, it is an infatuation. <br>  <br>  Respect your body, if I were you. Do this not because you are having issues regarding relationship; do this because your body says so, but in moderation (1-2 times a day is the only best limit that I can give to you). Enjoy life. There are a lot of things to do beside hiding in one room and doing something to relieve yourself in a troubling situation.|`|FU4TyghIaa	You're getting carried away here kid.<br>  If you think the purpose of a girlfriend is so you don't have to beat off?  Then you've got a lot to learn.<br>  You're question is ridiculous.  Girlfriends, that's people and relationships and love.  That takes time and personal development on your part.<br>  And too, you're pretty young, so losing the virginity deal no urgency.<br>  If you date a chick and figure, cool, now she can do me and I don't have to do it myself.  I think if that's your agenda, chicks are gonna sense it and not be too wild about it.  Well, some chicks maybe, but.  Masturbation is fine.  Don't freak out about it.<br>  Then, girls are people.  Being in love with somebody is a giving thing, not a selfish thing.<br>  Who knows, maybe in the next say one to four years you will meet somebody.  Fantasize, maybe that is all you can do.<br>  Your problem is you don't know what you're looking for in a girlfriend.|`|ffab01a92e978af828e5f1703775e5ddaa	Trust me, for what it's worth, even if you get a girlfriend soon you are NOT going to get all the relief you need there, if you get any at all... not at your age anyway...<br>  <br>  Your body absolutely wants to go crazy and reproduce you NOW, but that doesn't mean they are going to instantly just agree and take care of that for you.|`|CQ4ozjz6aa	its normal your hormones are in overdrive, it also feels good. and dont worry, girls will come around|`|4PprWjilaa	it means ur just like me  ............horny as hell lol|`|WyhCFoVCaa	dude i did it wen i was 12 now im 16  its normal it dosent mean u need a gf ansd its a very good way to rid of dstrees beat all u want|`|s25xNbu4aa	i personally think u need to get a girl|`|pu0qMaINaa	It's absolutely normal, most boys your age do the same thing.<br>  <br>  In fact, most males of any age masturbate regularly.|`|E64juLwJaa	It is not the lack of a g/f that makes you do this:but the amount of testosterone in your blood that makes you want to masturbate.<br>  And it is totally normal.<br>  Colors|`|pzLDXL6gaa	You're just a normal teenager, that's all.

That's not a solution, a 14 year old girl is not going to be able to help or satisfy you, she doesn't know any more than you do.

At 14 you don't need the stress of a sexual relationship.|`|DQ5nx7GEaa	no its normal. some guys i know started at 11 or 12. i think its kinda cute if you dont have a girlfriend and u masturbate. you are desparate for sex. but maybe you should keep masturbating and watch porn. thats the best thing you can do and find a girlfriend. if you want to mess around you can ask me. lol|`|KCEZVHgDaa	its normal for a teen boy such as yourself to do this. don't worry. its just your body telling you that you are no longer a boy. but a man.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	Desire is normal in any teen, your need is greatest during puberty.<br>  Just enjoy regular masturbation and don't worry!

mAp90hEeaa	You sound very pessimistic about your outlook on life which can often be one of the signs of depression.  Add to that the stress of school, the lack of social contacts which give a richness to your life - no wonder you are questioning yourself.  It might not be a bad idea to see your doctor or student health and ask to be put on an anti-depressant which can change your whole outlook on life in as little as 6 weeks (that is about how long they take to actually work).  Also, starting an exercise program - walking is easiest - start slowly and for short distances and gradually build up to a brisk pace for 30-45 minutes per day.  Warm muscles secrete serotonin which is the "feel good" chemical in your body and will also help lift your depression.  Next step is to go volunteer somewhere - pick one that might interest you a little.  Giving back is one of the greatest ways to make you feel better - no matter how many hours or how little hours you volunteer.  Spending too much time alone contributes to all the questioning of yourself.  A busy mind doesn't have time for all these issues and most of them will resolve themselves eventually without you analyzing them constantly.  The point is, you were put on this earth for a purpose - it may take some time to figure out what that is,  but some day, you will have an "ah-ha" moment when you realize this is your purpose for being here.|`|082bcae2a11e899c6ff6a688b0289096aa	Personally, I have gone through depression and have felt a lot like you on some of those issues.  I left college before finishing as my depression caught up with me...here I am at 31 and still not finished.  My opinion, you can always go back to school but don't leave to much time like I did to go back...also, look at other options...travel...actually, look into the military...my husband felt the same way you did in school and is now a SSgt in the Air Force...his brother DID finish college and is in the Coast Guard...they say they feel more meaning in their life...I know its not for everyone but there are different branches, traveling, you can finish your school with them...even join the Army as an officer....doesn't hurt to look into their sites and what jobs they have to offer...<br>  on the depression...my dad died when I was 17....it didn't hit me until I turned 20 in college...I pushed everyone close to me away and kind of lived in a bubble...not feeling any meaning to things in life...I did seek help and was on an anti-depressant for a while..until i learned life skills and felt better in coping with my loss...Yes, medication is also not for everyone but sometimes, when you are missing a chemical in your body, you should look into the different kinds or doses...I was off the medication for about 8 years but then after losing 3 babies with my husband, I couldn't stop crying...today I still take it...its been about 2 years now..I know it won't be that I am on it forever but until I can cope more with those losses...<br>  Don't give up...life isn't hopeless...you need to find the meaning to life TO YOU...even try attending church?  Different religions?<br>  Also, rent the documentary'The Secret'... very uplifting in regards to having positive thought...<br>  I wish you the best of luck...and happines...you will get there ....you are very young...remember, these experiences..life experiences...is what shapes you into who you are...good and bad....go out and explore...live life...its too short....

W9XTYRHpaa	Dude, I know how you feel... My dad is awesome, but sometimes just gets very angry out of nowhere. He gets on your back about everything. Arguing with him is pointless, if you every make a good point he'll just tell you to shut up, etc. The thing is, when he's not angry, he's a really awesome guy. These mood shifts are extremely stressful, and sometimes I wish I was a miscarriage. But here's what you got to do: Find your passion, and pursue it. If you do what you love you'll be happy whether your living in a mansion or a cardboard box on the side of the street. Whether this is playing a musical instrument or making people laugh, if you really want it you WILL get it. Never have anything to fall back on, because you WILL fall back on it and you won't be doing what you really want to do. But when you're upset or maybe suicidal, just do what you like and it'll make you happy. <br>  <br>  Thanks.|`|TraU6JFUaa	Dude, you are not a waste of life on this planet. EVERYONE is somebody and you have just as much of a right to live as anyone else. Just look at people who commit the most heinous crimes, athough they commit wicked deeds, even they trust to have the nerve to want to live. So since you are nowhere like that, how much more worthier you are.|`|jKUeZ826aa	Yea, life blows|`|99mgpoe9aa	I understand where you're coming from. You probably feel like you're stuck in a rut. I'm having a hard time, too as far as finances and sometimes I have days where I feel like giving up. But I know I can't, because there are people that love me and there are things I want to pursue. In your case, it must be hard not having a vehicle...that certainly limits you when applying for jobs. You can apply online or fax your resume to certain places, but nonetheless, you know how the job market is right now...some things are just out of your control. But trust me, being unemployed/living at home, etc does not make you a failure. Many people are in your shoes right now. All you can do is hang in there and keep your goals in mind. Do whatever you can to create a better life for yourself, but know that there will be factors that you can't control. Try to find ways to deal with your pain. Talk to friends or someone you trust and use outlets like writing or exercise. Of course, you won't feel like doing anything some days, but the idea is to realize that you're worth the effort and that you deserve better that what you have. Motivate yourself to keep going, no matter what happens..push yourself..the worst thing that can happen is ending up where you're already at. Know that you can do anything you put your mind to. Think of past accomplishments or things you've done that made you feel good about yourself and realize that you are capable of creating positive experiences in your life. Seriously, if you've made it this far you can keep going. Just take it one day at a time and don't put so much pressure on yourself. You're a good person and you will get through this. Things will change eventually.|`|K0FabRAIaa	You are lucky if you have parents who are not pushing you to get out while you try to work yourself out of your depressive state. I hope they are as supportive as I'm thinking right now - please appreciate them.<br>  <br>  Yes, I have felt like dying many times, and the feelings get worse when you don't have anyone to fall back on to help make it in this world. That is why I am emphasizing your situation with your parents right now. You need to do something to improve your life (and your mood) while it is easier. <br>  <br>  With that said, you need a goal to work towards. Start simple, but stick with it. For me enrolling back in school (online) was a push in a better direction. My esteem improved. <br>  <br>  Think about how you would like to be living in ten years. Is there a career that is interesting for you to work towards? You really need to focus on something positive. <br>  <br>  People don't have to stand in the way of your goals unless you let them. It really is ok (and wise) to tell people that you must focus on something else.<br>  <br>  If you are truly suffering from depression, ask your parents if they will  help you pay for counseling sessions. Depression is sometimes only manageable with professional help.

xmibEEdcaa	Do you know what sort of medicine she takes when she's sick?  Is it something a doctor prescribed for her?<br>  <br>  If your mom's been seeing a doctor, then the best thing you can do for her is probably just to be really understanding and supportive. Maybe she could use a little bit of help with the laundry and other chores, especially on days when she's not feeling well. Just reassuring her that it's okay for her to let you take care of her sometimes, instead of the other way around, might help her out. Parents can sometimes feel very guilty when they aren't able to be strong for their children. That guilt may be why she hasn't talked to you herself about exactly what's been making her so sick.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, it's hard to tell exactly why your mom is sick, because headaches and pain could be caused by a lot of different things.

uUpqKTwjaa	They don't hurt at all. In my opinion, they're much better than glasses [as long as you have an extra minute to spare in the morning and at night!] To clean them, you simply take the solution your eye doctor will provide you with, squirt a little into the palm of your hand, and rub your contact in it with your pointer finger. Your doctor will let you know exactly how to take care of them, don't worry. I think you should get them! :]|`|StZqcSKTaa	Contacts are fantastic!  Especially if you find yourself always pushing up your glasses, or are constantly active.  They don't hurt at all, at first they're a little uncomfortable at first, but once they're in for a while you'll forget that they're even in!  Once you get them from your doctor, he or she will give you solution to clean the contacts and store them in.  I totally recomend them, give em' a shot!
fk9AvB25aa	You can get oral herpes simply from kissing some one who has and or gets cold sores. Cold sores can be triggered to break out when your run down from too much stress, illnesses, even certain foods can trigger an out break if you eat too much of them over a period of time. There is a small chance that cold sores can be passed when there is no out break, but there is a better chance of passing them when there is a sore.<br>  You might get symptoms like itching, burning or tingling symptoms at one spot usually around the lips of your mouth. Then a pimply blister comes up on the skin usually where the previous symptoms are taking place. This can break out into a blister or sore. That is how you would know you are getting an out break.<br>  Here is some info on cold sores for you.<br>  <a href="http://kidshealth.org/teen/your_body/skin_stuff/cold_sores.html" rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/teen/your_body/ski...</a><br>  <a href="http://std.about.com/od/herpes/a/oralherpes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://std.about.com/od/herpes/a/oralher...</a>|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	Unless she had an open sore, the chances of it transmitting are slim to none.

6uQh4VSpaa	Yes, there is no real risk, especially since 10mg is a pretty low dose.  <br>  <br>  The first few times I had alcohol while on Zoloft (very similar to Lexapro), I got a little bit nauseous, and couldn't always get through a beer.  After my body got more used to the drug (like a month or two), I could drink a beer or two no problem.  <br>  <br>  Definitely don't drink heavily on it, but it doesn't sound like that's what you're planning.|`|LTsmr0SPaa	I've been on that strength and stronger--if you are talking about one 12 oz serving taken at least 12 hours after taking the Lexapro, you might get away with it provided you aren't taking any other medications.

AA12198724	No discharge is going to be there for a long time.  It cleans the vagina so you actually need it. Although it should not be much of a problem. Usually its clear and does not emit a harsh odor.  If you have excessive discharge you can try to douche but then that ruins the pH of your vagina so your best bet is to just leave it alone.

2RzEaod9aa	I'm a personal trainer, and I tell my clients to eat as clean as possible, but not to beat themselves up about a "bad" meal. I believe it is wrong to condone and suggest to others that they should have one cheat meal a week. This implies that you should reward yourself with bad food, and that bad food is really all the "good" stuff you're missing out on, when the opposite is true.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the reason you're not adding weight is because you are going balls to the wall with exercise. When I worked out 12-17 times each week, I was downing 3100-3500 calories per day. Granted, it was suuuuper clean (no processed junk, no additives, no artificial crap), but still, for a 5'7 woman, that's a ton of calories. I actually ended up losing 100lbs in about 10 months that way, and since I gave so many people advice, I figured I may as well get certified. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyway, I hope that answers your question.|`|OMxb4qF3aa	since your a sportsy person im a 'fat'?<br>  im 12 5'3<br>  <br>  pic:<br>  <a href="http://i726.photobucket.com/albums/ww263/shabeth1996/me.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i726.photobucket.com/albums/ww263...</a>

If it feels like its on the inside then this may be an allergic reaction to something you ate or rubbed up against. After showering try and rub some Bacitracin on the area. Even if you have to go next door to a friends house to have them apply it do it.

01Mu3wUeaa	No such thing as the stomach "flu" (flu=influenza which affects the respiratory track)<br>  <br>  Vomiting is a secondary immune response.In the case of Norwalk virus (the most common stomach virus) the virus is in the intestines, not the stomach therefore vomiting basically is pointless.<br>  <br>  How long has it been since your last dry heave? if it has been more than four hours, taking an anti emetic might not be needed (unless you are having nausea...then it might help)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Are you experiencing diarrhea too? if so, You need to take little sips of water/gatorade/pedialyte so you can stay hydrated.This shall pass within 24 hours or so.<br>  <br>  Prevention:<br>  <br>  Norwalk virus<br>  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)<br>  <br>  The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.<br>  <br>  PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.<br>  <br>  The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.<br>  <br>  It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)<br>  <br>  Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.<br>  <br>  If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.<br>  <br>  To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.<br>  <br>  People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)<br>  <br>  The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!<br>  <br>  TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.|`|mAp90hEeaa	Phenergan is an anti-nausea medication which will stop the vomiting.  It will also make you very sleeping.  You don't have to throw up - your body will take care of itself.  But, be aware that after vomiting (or almost vomiting), diarrhea may occur because that is your body's way of getting rid of the offending "bug" that you currently have.  For more information on caring for yourself, you can go to WebMd.com and type in gastroenteritis in the search line and read up on the suggestions there.|`|v4Kt9B61aa	I am terrified of throwing up, so I've down tons of research to avoid this, haha.

A5ctEDmvaa	Complicated stuff and you're smart to be asking the questions you are. I'll break it down.<br>  <br>  (Disclosure) I've been through a lot of what you are dealing with, except the alcoholic dad. That said I've blaimed things on my parents before.<br>  <br>  1. Good to go to counseling. Give it time and trust your instincts. If you don't seem to mesh with the therapist then try another one. Just be realistic about whether you are giving the therapist a fair chance. :P<br>  <br>  2. Take a list of these things to your therapist. It may help get things off to a good start and it will definitely keep you from rambling a lot during your first sessions. You are making an effort to take control of your life. That is excellent! You will get there in time.<br>  <br>  3. Regarding the friend. If your guts tell you that you're getting on their nerves then you probably are. Most folks (especially around your age) are not great at understanding their friends depression or other heavy issues. It's usually not because they don't care. It's just heavy stuff and maybe they have their own issues to deal with (and just aren't showing it externally). Be forgiving but also give some space. Trust your instincts if you can.<br>  <br>  4. Don't expect anyone to fill the role of your father. Father/son relationships are very specific and being without a strong one is very hard. I respect you for being so honest in your assessment. I know friends with similar situations and it took many years to come to a strong relationship. A large part of that was forgiving their dads for not being what they needed.<br>  <br>  5. Regarding drinking: Seriously talk to your doctor about the medical side of alcoholism. I am not accusing you of anything but your risk is really really high. A good doctor will be able to offer some info so you make sure you control that aspect of your life. I'm sure you know that drinking will cloud your judgement and I'm guessing that you (like myself) tend to get into more "bad" situations while drinking than when sober. That stuff adds up and just places more stress on you.<br>  <br>  6. You are probably right to say that "being just like your friend" is a bad thing. I suggest bringing that up with the therapist.<br>  <br>  You have a hard path to walk, sir, but you've taken the first step. Keep working on yourself and don't be afraid to ask for help from people you can trust. That may mean AA, therapy, a church (if that is your thing), or some other group (maybe go to the YMCA and start exercising). You've got a long and happy life somewhere ahead of you. You've just got to find it.|`|coPtU10Laa	Good luck with the counseling. Sounds like you got handed the genetic shaft unfortunately not all of us get a good parental roll model. Lay off the booze, alcohol is a depressant and won't help you feel better about yourself. Other than that pay attention to your counselor their trained in how to help you. Your friend will probably come around more after you become less dependent on him and more on yourself.|`|jMed0ppEaa	personally, im a girl, but you know my dad has nothing to do with me either, drinking away the pain isnt going to do anything but kill you trust me i know. Maybe your friend just needs sometime away from everything. Taking on the task of being a roll model is a big thing. You may want to try socializing more and opening doors for new things. You may find what you have been looking for. Being a teen is tough, finding who you are, what you want to be, what to do, who to be friends with, there is so much going on we get lost within the first couple hours of out day. If you get out experience new things you could find something that will change your life. I wish you the best of luck.|`|ohsZhXRmaa	I know how that feels. My dad was an alcoholic while my mom was in jail. I had five friends who all had perfect lives with perfect families, and after they found out about my mom a few of them couldn't be around me anymore. Its really hard, and there were many times that I wondered if going through that type of hell was worth it, or if I should end it then and there. I'm younger than you, and I did it. You have the option to try and get a job and get away from your dad. Believe me, things will get better. It may not seem like it now, but trust me. Learn to be more confident and dont look down on yourself. I'm sure your just as good as your friend its, you just haven't reached your full potential.|`|BY02DhfWaa	okay, kido you have to stop blaming your dad for everything i know it was his fault that he is a alcoholic but he did not make you do the same thing .do you really want to put your kids through this some day you have a choice you need to stop drinking it is going to consume you some day . you need to tell the counselor this week the truth and get help for this addiction before it consumes your life you are to young to be this way dont let the alcohol  win .|`|KvBA8wS3aa	It is probably a good thing not to hang out with your friend quite as much, as I'm guessing it makes you feel worse for your own circumstances. You should never try to be like someone else, because you never really know who they are.<br>  I'm happy you have decided to see a counseller, they can really help. There is no harm in loking up to your friend, but their is harm in wanting to be what he is. All you can be is youself and yo have to be happy with that, and if you are not, you have to change your life so you are! There is always an option. You have recconised that ou are depressed and are seeking help, thats the first step to recovery, and if you really want to get better ou will do everything in your power, so theres nothing stopping you. Goodluck :)

If they couldn't get that, they used a mixture of baking soda and salt.  (The baking soda whitens and absorbs odor, the salt provides a bit of abrasion.)<br>  Mix the two, (about 2 parts baking soda to 1 part salt,) with a little water to make a paste, and dip your wet toothbrush into the paste.<br>  If the taste bothers you, you can make a couple of tablespoons ahead of time and add a drop of peppermint oil.

Given that it is used in baking, it also implies safety. Baking soda is sprinkled on the toothbrush, and teeth then cleaned using a gentle, circular motion. Care should still be taken though, especially for people with gum sensitivity. Old wives’ recipes often state that a paste of baking powder, a little salt, and a few drops of white vinegar, works effectively.<br>  <br>  Salt, used exactly as baking soda, is also touted as being a good teeth whitener. However, it might just be its osmosis, dehydrating action that makes teeth appear whiter, since dehydrated teeth look whiter. <br>  <br>  Lemon juice is often used, but it had high acidic levels, so teeth can weaken in the long run. Other natural, fruit options regard rubbing the inside of an orange peel on the teeth. A strawberry cut in half and the inside rubbed on teeth also works. Mashed strawberry can also be applied with a toothbrush. Apple cider vinegar is also said to be effective. Dried orange rind, and walnut bark, is also good.<br>  <br>  For other effective home teeth whitening solutions, you may wish to read about them here :  <a href="http://teeth-whitening.my-fashion-house.com/" rel="nofollow">http://teeth-whitening.my-fashion-house....</a>

fv2GAAdPaa	The causes of hypochondriasis are not precisely known. Children may have physical symptoms that resemble or mimic those of other family members. In adults, hypochondriasis may sometimes reflect a self-centered character structure or a wish to be taken care of by others; it may also have been copied from a parent's behavior. In elderly people, hypochondriasis may be associated with depression or grief. It may also involve biologically based hypersensitivity to internal stimuli.<br>  <br>  Most hypochondriacs are worried about being physically sick, although some express fear of insanity. The symptoms reported can range from general descriptions of a specific illness to unusual complaints. In many instances the symptoms reflect intensified awareness of ordinary body functions, such as heartbeat, breathing, or stomach noises. It is important to understand that a hypochondriac's symptoms are not "in the head" in the sense of being delusional. The symptoms are real, but the patient misinterprets bodily functions and attributes them to a serious or even lethal cause.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.healthatoz.com/healthatoz/Atoz/common/standard/transform.jsp?requestURI=/healthatoz/Atoz/ency/hypochondriasis.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthatoz.com/healthatoz/Ato...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/3287" rel="nofollow">http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/3287</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helped you!<br>  <br>  =]|`|iWat12yFaa	Hypochondriasis (or hypochondria, sometimes referred to as health phobia) refers to an excessive preoccupation or worry about having a serious illness. Often, hypochondria persists even after a physician has evaluated a person and reassured them that their concerns about symptoms do not have an underlying medical basis or, if there is a medical illness, the concerns are far in excess of what is appropriate for the level of disease. Many people suffering from this disorder focus on a particular symptom as the catalyst of their worrying, such as gastro-intestinal problems, palpitations, or muscle fatigue.

vURKBxvWaa	i think the reason our childhood memories might be a little distorted is because when we are little kids, we dont have as much experience. so when we encounter something that we have never seen before, our brains have nothing to compare it to. when we see things as kids, we dont really always know what were looking at. So when we try to remember what happened when we were kids, it might be a little different than what our parents remember because at the time, we didnt even know what was going on.|`|Vwqaen0saa	Memories<br>  <br>  Not Much To Remember Is There<br>  ...Abandoned At The Age Of 8 Weeks Old lol<br>  ...Yeah Screwed My Life Up ( Don't Wna No )|`|N5Yx86sYaa	Hmm I dont remember anything younger than the age of 3, but when I was 4ish I would dream about things from when I would have been about 10-12 monthes old, like my mothers red sheets.. idk

I don't know. <br>  <br>  It sounds like a coincidence.|`|XCrPWQh8aa	maybe they're just the ones flaunting their bodies more so you notice it.  a lot of girls with great bodies who aren't ready for sex don't wear clothes that let you see how great their bodies are.<br>  <br>  otherwise, i'd say it's just a coincidence.|`|pU1fAci6aa	thats not true, people who lose their virginity at an early age doesnt mean they have a great body.<br>  <br>  what you mean is that people with great bodies get sex faster (at a younger age) because they have great bodies.<br>  <br>  hope i helped x|`|6HvmtTzDaa	I know a girl thats 15 and she not a virgin and she looks great!|`|Bo3M090Xaa	bc they aren't afraid to put their stuff out there|`|QWylMGLGaa	Well, obviously only hot girls get laid.

Maybe it's just that they always had the great body, that's why they lose it early cause they are so hot there bound to be turned on by a hot guy seeing as how horny guys are at that age. and the ones with not so great bodies didnt loose it early cause no guy wanted to do it with them?<br>  tell me if you get a nother answer.|`|UVgt1IhPaa	I think its more of a natural selection thing. I believe that perhaps these girls have always had nice looking bodies, and therefore they found it easiest to have sex and lost their virginity at a young age.  i dont think losing it at a young age creates a great body, genetics do.|`|KL1Y5FeHaa	What has virginity got to do with ending up with a good body.

iPsFTNivaa	I've seen larger over jets (that is the proper term for what you are talking about) than yours and they have not required surgery.  There are "bite jumping" appliances (a Herbst and a MARA are 2 that our office uses) that can help correct your over jet.  They are normally cemented in, and stay in for about 10-12 months.  Ask your orthodontist if these are options for you.  I would also recommend a 2nd opinion, especially if you haven't started treatment with this orthodontist.  It won't hurt anything to confirm his diagnosis.|`|eMW9a5JBaa	wow! you must have a big over bite and jaw problem..before you let them do the surgery..call your insurance and ask them.make sure that they send the approval first..just to  make sure they will cover for this expense. but if your doctor thinks that this is necessary ..do it!

The main thing is to vary in workouts because your body will become used to the same workout over and over which will make it less effective than it used to be.|`|pEzIF9FQaa	if you did thid everyday for 6 months you would definately see a difference in your stomach it may get a little smaller meaning you might lose an inch or two.  You would have some rock hard abs but you wouldnt be able to see the abs if you dont lower your food intake slightly and try to do a little cardio like walking you probably wont lose body fat.  So maybe try some walking and eat 1600 calories a day along with your crunches and also look up some lower stomach crunches and some side crunches exersices on the internet for a toned midsection.  You will look great.  Hope I helped.|`|YRB0jIRraa	um... I guess, but you would probably get really BORED!<br>  <br>  I would suggest eating more lean protein - fish and chicken, more vegetables, whole grains (brown rice, buckwheat pasta, wholegrain pasta and crackers), fruit, almonds and yoghurt. cut down on cheeses, and maybe swap dairy milk for low fat, skim or soy milk. Also pick up some Metamucil, it's cheap & a good fiber drink.<br>  <br>  You will lose weight more quickly that way! Go for walks, get a gym membership & use their treadmill... pilates and yoga are great for the stomach and build up your adominals quite well... but yeah I would suggest improving your diet first... If you don't have a good diet you will NEVER get a good stomach.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!<br>  Emma Kate xoxo|`|sEFCfHjWaa	It matters if you have weight in your stomach area. If you have flab there, then you would lose some in the process. And yes, you would get a tighter stomach.|`|lAvWp7f9aa	i really dont kno...wait i actuallly do cuz i do 200 situps a day and ive been doing tha for bout 2 weeks and i have lost bout 3 pounds|`|oAu89Xzraa	By doing straight sit ups you would build only your abdominus rectus (6 pack) but by concentrating solely on the one muscle group you may cause postural imbalance. You will need to work your obliques and your lower back to maintain balance.<br>  <br>  You may lose some weight but it will likely be negligible. Be advised, you cannot target fat loss. It must be lost as a whole and the easiest way to lose body fat (notice 'fat' not 'weight') is by alternating resistance exercise focusing on your biggest muscle groups (quads, glutes etc) and high intensity interval training. Try deadlifts, squats, leg press and lots of fartlec training.|`|hdHEZ1phaa	you would not lose weight because the fat that you have you are now turning into muscle, you would get a tighter stomach

C0K3Bo2Aaa	Hello. Yup, pooing will help but what ya did was ate a lot of salty stuff. Your body is holding on to water. You will be back to normal in a few days. It takes me 3-4 days.<br>  It's just "water weight"|`|xqQO81Omaa	You can't have gained 4lb of fat overnight....in fact you couldn't even have gained a pound because out of that 3,500 calories, you probably burnt at least half of it. So at most you could gain 1/2 a pound of fat, the rest is likely to be due to fluid retention.|`|TPTpwarwaa	Even though you're consuming say 3500 calories like you did, you still burn calories throughout the day (even if you're sitting all day!) so you burn atleast 2500 calories just sitting. So that definately wouldn't add up, but like you said-it's most likely all of that food and water/liquids sitting in you. <br>  Just start off eating healthy again and get in the routine of things. <br>  What i do is have a little treat a few times a week to beat cravings/binging when i'm out with friends or anything, and also with ice cream (or anything else unhealthy) i usually pair it with some healthy foods like nuts, fruit/veggies, whole grains (granola for ice cream), etc. <br>  Plus, when i do eat a bit more than i want to-i just run an extra 15 minutes or do a bit more of exercising the next few days.|`|fecUjSr1aa	Nope ... not really, it was just the burst of food intake you took (when? last night?) you'll probably carry that "extra" weight for a couple of days. so after "break" you'll have to "punish" yourself a little bit by getting back to your diet routine (no excuses) and perhaps you could do some early morning (or evening) walk just to burn off those atrocious 3500 calories out of your system. some physical exercises would be good to help you maintain the weight you're trying to keep yourself on ...|`|Qe5MqiRvaa	when you cut calories your metabolism slows down dramatically so idk maybe but ull loose it soon

DCixOqsnaa	My wife quit smoking cold turkey.  She had a pretty difficult time with everything in general.  I dont think your issue is psychological.  Your body is now doing without horrible toxins that you have been inhaling for 4 years straight.  These body reactions you are having are likely to be withdrawal symptoms. You have probably heard that quitting smoking is harder than stopping heroin.  The sensation you are probably feeling is all that crap leaving your body and your body readjusting to not having crap in it!!!!  Hang in there....drink lots of water and eat healthy foods at least in the short term to make sure its not a food related issue.  DONT PANIC, HANG IN THERE AND GOOD LUCK TO YOU!!!!|`|aRmekl72aa	you are paranoid, i quit smoking a couple weeks ago and to help with the urges i just run or swim. After running or swimming i used to get a burning throat and lungs now it has dissipated, but regardless it is hard for me to bring myself to smoke after exercising as it makes my lungs hurt more.
VCIZJQCJaa	it's extra strength tylenol that is the strongest  over the counter pain medicine next to a weak narcotic.darvocet is next on the ladder up.do you have a hot tub or a hot bath to soak in- tip-take the tylenol 15 minutes before hopping in to soak.the combination of the tylenol and warm water will double the results.also do you have a heating pad to use when you get out or to use when you start to hurt.the secret is to treat the pain before it gets too bad,once it sets in it is so much harder to deal with.hope this helps

I actually had to get my bones measured to see if I'd be able to have my first baby naturally. After the x-rays and measuring, they said I could have a 10 pound baby no problem. Thankfully he was only 9 lbs, and not the 10-11 pounds they thought.|`|JW5wFT8Xaa	I'm also 4"11" and 90lbs.  I've had two full term, vaginal births.

LuOKkfa8aa	I had that done when I was 17.  I had a bloody discharge one morning and went to a urologist.  The doc did the usual exam and ordered a cystoscopy.  They put me to sleep and everything went fine.  The first time I peed some blood came out, but that is normal.  The next couple days were rough.  It hurt really bad to pee due to the stretching of the eurethera when they put the camera in.  Other than that it was not that bad.  Hope this helps.

Zt6eh6VRaa	It takes waaaay more than a cleanser to get acne under control. It takes using right products in the right way; and also, keeping up with the skin's ability to adapt to products that is the key.<br>  <br>  For a start, you can get some Neutrogena On the Spot benzoyl peroxide and start of veeery slowly with it. Just wear it for 15 minutes a day. Then double the wearing time every three days. Then, when you are up to wearing it for 3 hours for 3 days in a row, then start wearing it overnight. You need to wear benzoyl everyday in order for it to work and not just "on the spot" but all over. It prevents the acne from forming in the first place.  Then once your skin acclimates to this, then get a stronger benzoyl peroxide formuation – but make sure it doesn’t have pore-clogging ingredients in it. <br>  <br>  That will help your acne alot, but it usually takes more than that to get clear. It usually takes a combination of a strong exfoliating serum and benzoyl peroxide to get clear. The other thing is to stay ahead of your skin's ability to adapt to products. If you use the same products in the same way your skin won't get clear either. You need to strengthen your homecare every couple of weeks - like using a stronger benzoyl peroxide or using the benzoyl twice a day.

Its only 20 bucks and it has left my skin clear and soft. I still have a few breakouts every so often and i still have scaring from previous acne but it really has worked well in keeping my skin clear.

AA11417499	Yes it is possible, a nurse at my workplace went on weight watchers and lost a bunch in ( it seemed no time at all) she now looks like a live barbie. You can do it.|`|7mhtevUTaa	The formula for losing weight is not difficult - eat less and move more often - the problems surface when we really try to put that into practice! There are loads of opportunities to fail in the real world aren't there?! The one diet that definitely delivered for me is green tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a few free trials left, it has been reported in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I shed thrity pounds, it definitely does produce results!|`|PtJnPMh7aa	my boyfriend gave me these diet pills...i know tht sounds bad but i made him.<br>  anyways<br>  we decided to go runiing at 5am and i was suposed to take 1 of the pills. i took 4 and within about 15 minutes i felt the rush and by the end of the day we ran about 15-20 miles. it was crazy. i lost 10 pounds that day. it was really amazing. the pill is called stackers<br>  just in case you want them... the risk tho is speeding up your heeart rate|`|0NfJ1D0zaa	It is possible.  Learn to listen to your stomach and stop eating when you're full.  Although, for your money, I'd stay away from the treadmill and stick to an elyptical machine.  They are a lot easier on your joints and you'll burn a whole lot more calories in the same amount of time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|p5u42VfQaa	It is theoretically possible but honestly unlikely. What's the rush?|`|k6M48eUMaa	Yep, it sounds quite good. <br>  If you really do work out every day and never cheat with your diet, and stick to WATER ONLY, you should definately be 120 by June. If you need help with your diet call the people at Weight Watchers because they know their stuff.<br>  Good luck ?|`|MJt1xeQ7aa	yes u can actually, the more fat u are the more ul lose quickly, just dont eat any thing fatning, only fruit, yoghurts forn snacks and seriosuly cut down carbs , this is what makes u stay fat! and do exercise as it burns fat and keeps ur metabolism high.
FNeCDm3raa	Losing that much weight in such a short time would cause saggy skin, no matter what you do........possibly stretch marks as well. It's not worth it. Lose the weight slowly, from now, until you lose all that you want, which means you will need to keep working through the summer as well.<br>  <br>  To get toned, you need to do weight/resistance training - it will also speed up weight loss because you will build muscle mass. And don't worry about lifting weights, women will never look men, so pick them up!!!|`|85KL0eUUaa	it wouldn't really be possible, you could manage 30-40<br>  but it would depend<br>  if you just dieted and didn't work out, yes<br>  if you ran/walked and dieted, not as bad, but still yes<br>  but if you did something like swimming, yoga, pilates, kickboxing, boxing etc in addition to diet/cardio, not really.|`|kt7kkOtqaa	Doctors typically don't recommend losing more than 2-3 lbs/week. And you've got about 12 weeks until June, so it would be pretty unhealthy to lose more than 36lbs by then. I don't think your skin would look very saggy, but in order to be toned, you can't skip the weights at the gym.|`|gdVpLMz8aa	you would be saggy babe. i had a baby a year and a half ago and lost weight too quick now my stomach is a bit saggy. be very careful slow steady weight loss is best speal to your doctor or nutritionist or go on the spark people website they have good advice have a browse through it, they also have like 15 min work outsthat you can watch and do its great xx|`|aw5BGkmLaa	You don't want to lose it that fast. 1. you probably won;t keep it off<br>  2. you may get saggy skin<br>  <br>  Target 2 pounds per week.

But God has helped me and I know there is hope with him.  Counseling is always good, and antidepressants are good to help you start feeling like your self again.

It is very important to ensure that you have meals from all four food groups.  All fats (saturated and unsaturated), all natural carbohydrate, all proteins and pure water makes up the four food groups that ensures good vibrant health.<br>  <br>  Because tryptophan is an substance found in the banana they are helpful for depression. Tryptophan helps the body by converting this protein in serotonin. This action helps with relaxation and can stimulate feelings of happiness. So another benefit of eating bananas is mood enhancement.<br>  <br>  Avoid junk food (empty carbohydrates) eat more healthy foods: Raw fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  Saturated fat is important for the production of cholesterol.  Low cholesterol levels can also cause depression.<br>  <br>  Eating the right foods can lift our spirits and swallow up stress.

Ask Jesus to help you through this and give your life to Him- trust me, He will work everything out.
vMaaDxAQaa	What you're describing is indeed symptoms of depression and anxiety.  When you experience the more severe aspects of these psychological conditions, it isn't uncommon to develop Somatoform Disorder, which is the physical manifestation of emotional distress.   There are several who receive significant relief from the drug Neurontin.  It is non- narcotic and has few side effects compared to the more frequently prescribed anti-depressants.  Hope this helps! God Bless~|`|y8xaI8jPaa	I would agree with the possibility of an anxiety disorder, take a paper bag with you on your next outing, and go somewhere private like the toilets, sit down and breathe deeply in and out of the bag to prevent hyperventilating.|`|LDjZGuDaaa	i have anxiety also....<br>  i took the drug extacy and felt great <br>  i think they need to relegalize mdma<br>  look it up on the web|`|3pWwclqpaa	yeah! i know what your talking about.|`|BY02DhfWaa	that is anxiety , your doc is right i went to the store and i almost pasted out i am not kidding .depression is what you said you just feel numb no energy not weak but idk you feel like all you want to do is sleep i have had depression and anxiety for like 20yrs +  i have been taking zoloft and it helps .i can get through the day i can go out in public i teach sunday school i have been doing vacation bible school i feel like a new person you should talk to your doc about meds they really do what they say they do .|`|oK6sZ2fmaa	I too have anxiety,I once told my doctor it felt as if to get anywhere I had to push this huge wall that was always in front of me, he tried to help, but you may need a shrink,I'm serious,they know more about the way you're feeling and why.Just try one and see.It'll be worth it.|`|8RqmZ3zpaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZEH4E6BY..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZEH4E6BY...</a><br>  <br>  I found this youtube video quite some time ago when I was battling with my Panic Disorder.

It may be the medication that you're on is giving you adverse side effects. Check with the psych if that's the case.|`|4YJPYqzXaa	I've had it since I was 5 years old thanks to my mother....
fypgDK53aa	Many women experience irregular periods their first few years, and nothing I'm reading in your question seems out of the ordinary. Irregular periods are very common as your body is learning how to produce hormones and relase eggs. Many early periods are anovulatory (meaning you don't ovulate), which means they may be late and light due to the hormone differences. <br>  <br>  Throughout your whole life, you'll find that each of your periods will be different - some light, some short, some long, some crampy, some you feel like a million bucks. Normal, normal, normal all in their un-normality :) Some women never settle into a timed cycle, and that's normal for them too. You will settle into a "normal" for you, in time. <br>  <br>  The tampons won't make a difference in how your period is, other than a little more convenient. Just make sure to change them frequently and always wash your hands before inserting one.|`|yeW8sJKCaa	Mine was like that.Periods are weird like that and that's why it sucks.<br>  You may feel sick to your stomach,crampy,fat or bloated,hot,and it's all very uncomfortable.With your period it will never seem normal.<br>  What I do is count on a calender when I got it and count 21 days to see the next time I should get it.A couple days before and I couple days after I wear a pad or tampon just to be safe.It's all normal and you should be fine.|`|UIF7OBuxaa	Perfectly normal.<br>  You may be in your twenties when it finally becomes normal.<br>  <br>  Don't be alarmed if you don't get it again for a few months, irregularities are very normal and common.|`|iRhnze6maa	Normally your period is irregular when you first get it, sometimes it doesn't mean anything. If you are really worried go to the doctor.|`|dR4b3beNaa	your period will be irregular for the first 3-4 years. ur fine|`|ipAfshe1aa	Am not a girl, but I hope my answer might help. During the initial and final phases (menopause) of menstrual cycle, periods may not follow typical patterns - irregular in timing/quantity of flow,etc. Even brief periods of amenorrhea may occur. Basically, the system is getting adjusted to changes in hormonal levels. From the body's viewpoint, it's all going to be different after menarche and menopause. Cramps are not a must for menses. If you didn't have just be happy about it. So in short, you can be happy that you are entering womanhood & sexual life normally. So just enjoy!!|`|etNVFqUcaa	you r perfectly fine my period was irregular trust me not everyone has pms.|`|t2LOcPkLaa	It's normal for things to be a little wacky at first. You should be glad you didn't get cramps! It varies time to time for me... sometimes they're unbearable and sometimes I'm fine. The tampons won't have made a difference, although I don't suggest using them if you have cramps. If you're really worried about all of this, have a talk with your mom or your doctor or an aunt or an older cousin or friend... someone reliable that you trust.
oKRbe6XYaa	If it's too tight for you(*_*)|`|Ks6Ac9SSaa	Sometimes when you have one on all day or you have it too tight it sure feels like it does.

F6uAWBluaa	another general practitioner. these symptoms may be unrelated (ankle cramps - stomach fullness) or may not. the gp can make a referral to a specialist. could all be related to the flu, i suppose, but best to make sure. they say if symptoms last for 2 weeks, to see a doctor.<br>  <br>  if you've seen one and symptoms continue, see another.<br>  <br>  hope you feel better. <br>  <br>  jo|`|hE4CXKX2aa	You have a lot of stress going on with yourself.

Is their anything that didn't happend that is suppose to?  Just asking, and something you should be asking yourself and also I do think you need a psychologist and a doctor.  Not your family one, but a second opinion one.|`|45qyvYU2aa	I'd pick a new family doctor for a second opinion, as your doctor is either unwilling or unable to attempt to explain your symptoms.  As for your ankle pain being "remnants of a flu," that symptom doesn't make a whole lot of sense and may have something to do with why he isn't taking you seriously.|`|L2tQ7t6Faa	Urologist, or another specialist that deals with gastro-intestinal stuff.|`|UKKMPJjlaa	Try going to a "walk in clinic" getting another doctors opinion.<br>  Try also consulting some of your friends, if they've had any similar symptoms.<br>  If you fear it truley is impacting you, you could do something as drastic as going into the ER at the nearest hospital, just expect the wait to be long!<br>  <br>  Feel better!!|`|ZD7aLAkWaa	I think you need to see a doctor that specializes in blood disorders. You have some symtoms of poisoning, possibly lead. Discuss this with you MD, and he will ask you questions about your environment and your depression. These questions and tests will rule in or out 90% of your discomfort.|`|ed05ZIrsaa	I think you should see a general physician. <br>  <br>  If you haven't been drinking enough water, you will have these symptoms. Also, if you are constipated these symptoms will appear.

FGm4dLinaa	I had all four of mine removed Friday as well. I stuck with milkshakes and pudding the first day. But by the second day I ate soup with crackers, meatloaf, and some mashed potatoes! :) They say it is better to start back on your normal diet as soon as possible. Just don't push yourself because you don't want to remove the blood clot which will cause dry socket- that can be pretty painful. So don't drink though a straw, swish, or anything too tough yet. But you can definitely brush your teeth just not the areas where the teeth were removed! :)|`|kyTDQEWaaa	No hard tacos, soft is ok.   Eat soft foods and rinse like crazy when you're done.   I'd skip the pizza too if the crust is too crunchy.|`|34b7iK7Jaa	Your dentist should have given you a care sheet to take home with you after your extractions. Here's what mine says.<br>  <br>  Eating: Drink lots of fluids and eat only soft nutritious foods on the day of the extraction. Don't use alcoholic beverages and avoid hot and spicy foods. You can begin eating normally the next day, or as soon as it is comfortable.<br>  <br>  Oral hygiene: Gently rinse your mouth with salt water three times a day (a tsp. of salt in a cup of warm water, rinse-swish-spit). Also, rinse gently after meals - it helps keep food out of the extraction site. It is very important to resume your normal dental routine after 24 hours, which should include brushing your teeth and tongue and flossing at least once a day. This speeds healing and helps keep your breath and mouth fresh.<br>  <br>  So I say go for the pizza if you're comfortable with chewing it. Just rinse (spit gently too, you wouldn't want to dislodge the blood clot and end up with dry socket...ouch.)|`|bPpfbFxNaa	Jessica, read the post op instructions you were given : (
oc90ru3waa	I feel for you hun, i Suffer from pretty bad panic attacks as well.<br>  Somedays i have no hpe, others are better.  But it never really leaves me..I;ve always hated the thought of taking medication to screw my head up even more, they have very terrible side effects. The best advice i can give u is dont give up hope. Its sounds like your devoloping panic disorder, which is when you fear having another attack. Panic attacks are very horryfying, but they dont last forever. You need to remmeber that your anxiety is causing these symptoms, freaking out more will just add to the situation. Do you know why you have these panic attcks? You should try to find out the source of them.  Sounds like you need a change in your life. Take up a hobby or start doing something new. Excerisize on a regular basis is proven to reduce stress levels. <br>  Drnking hot tea<br>  meditation and yoga<br>  writing down your thoughts and feelings<br>  take a limited time out of the day dto do your worrying<br>  set up a day scedule and stick with it<br>  Take time out of the day just for yourself and do soemthing relaxing such as a bath<br>  Learn deep relaxation breathing practices<br>  Learn about CBT cognitive-bahavioral therapy, you can even do it on your own, it had to do with changing your thoughts and reactions of stress, and better coping techniques.<br>  Talk to somebody you trust. Tell them your feelings, just having someone around that cares is important.<br>  make sure youe getting adequate sleep and healthy eating<br>  Have a laugh.<br>  <br>  You have to be determined that you can get past this, if you keep on thinking negativley and keep thinking "omg i will never get past this anxiety and panic attack" then msot likley you wont. You need to start thinking more positivley and start really working towards getting to your goal- Being panic free. Im going to post a few sites for you to check out which are very helpful and imformative. Good luck, I will pray for you. Nobody should have to go through this.|`|7fYIIhiSaa	I suffer with panic attacks myself. I was put on paxil to help with the anxiety and xanax but i didn't take the xanax cuz i was scared to take it.

Fear of the panic, and depression feed off each other... The result? Anxiety/Panic attacks.   Medication can break this cycle, and allow you to address the underlying problem. <br>  <br>      In the meantime, try and identify the TRIGGERS for your attacks. It may not be apparent so try keeping a log of your panic attacks. Date, time, location, activity. Or a diary type record. This will help identify and give you the opportunity to take a disconnected look at the event. As they say: "Identifying the problem is the first step." <br>  <br>      You're not alone though. I've been diagnosed as having moderate PTSD. I got them too. Eventually, I started working through the problems, and memories that cause them.  You CAN get through it, but it takes time, patience, and work.

I suggest you speak to a counsellor. I'm sure there is one at your school.|`|45qyvYU2aa	You learn these things so you don't flip burgers for a living.

In highschool, i took drama and didnt need it, but it gave me more credits and it didnt hurt. you might not like it now but it looks good on your transcript if you live in japan and know english, then you just know a little more than your friends which doesnt hurt. and the small classes your taking now is just to build up to the bigger classes and its hard, but it worth it at the end. dont worry, there are alot of people in your place now, and it doesnt matter if you dont have friends, just be yourself and people like you for you. if they dont thats their problem.  if your getting bullied, just ignore it because all those people who bully you dont have anything else interesting in their lives. so don't give up, you can do it=)

Intimacy is a whole lot more.<br>  Turn it around, are you gonna judge a partner on their physical deal like that?  I can only say that it doesn't and shouldn't in my opinion.  Your friend's dad, well you prodably heard it through your friend not straight from the horse's mouth so it's really not admissible as evidence.  Cut guys can get very defensive and say things like that.  <br>  <br>  If you had a situation where it was so bad that a chick objected.

The body wants it, but the subconscious won't allow it.|`|45qyvYU2aa	Depends on the GP, but a 22 year-old guy having erection difficulty only in certain situations suggests a mental block that you're having, perhaps a performance anxiety.

KKwQdKa4aa	Well you're mom is rude for wanting to sue someone for that.<br>  But ahhh, wait. This is america. We're sue-happy. -.-<br>  <br>  Anyways, your best bet is to go to the dentist because your healthcare (which you most likely have) will usually cover 2 visits to the dentist and help pay for anything extra, like fixing your tooth. Even if it's a baby tooth, it can get infected and spread. Get it fixed at the dentist soon, it shouldn't cost too much if you have healthcare.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	The dentist can bond it.  I don't know how much it costs but its not going to be that much.   Don't worry about your mom.  Sh*t happens when you have kids.  She'll get over it.  She's just venting her frustration.

qPrNjUjkaa	That sounds exactly like my dad. He broke his leg in June ice skating and had a rod put into his leg. His surgeon told him that his leg would never be the same, but he would be able to function. His leg and foot look a little different from where they once were. It is perfectly normal. Broken bones needing surgery in many cases never return to its original state, though you should be able to function just fine.|`|NVxGp317aa	Your leg will necer be perfect but physical therapy should help some with getting things back to regular position.

MCITbIlSaa	You are a biochemical machine. An adaptive yet sensitive balance of chemicals within your body work to keep balance and maintain the body as a whole. Everything in your body depends on the right chemical balances and anything introduced into that system can effect the body's normal operation. Illness and improper nutrition can most definitely effect your menstrual cycle, but so can a lot of other things. Your best bet is to seek the opinion of a medical professional regarding your condition. Being sick, not eating right, and inturruption of your menstrual cycle can all be symptoms of another underlying condition. But don't take my word for it, go ask a doctor!|`|1taqxI72aa	yes it can.

If you need to have it removed (if that's the cause of the pain) and other surgery done to fix what wasn't done properly .... that should be the doc's responsibility and not your insurance company's. Plus, if you have time off work for more surgery ... I should think whoever made the error is liable for that.
45qyvYU2aa	They provide some protection, but sheepskin condoms (non-latex) don't have the same degree of protection that the latex ones do because of differences in the pore sizes.  You should also know that it is still possible to get some STDs (such as herpes) even with PERFECT use of a condom.|`|fvuEtkROaa	Abstinence is the only sure protection. If you are sexually active, condoms are the best thing to help prevent STD's. A condom plus another form of birth control such as the pill will help in preventing pregnancy.  I commend you for trying to get answers to these questions, so that you stay safe.|`|LrGmpacOaa	No. Sheep skin condoms do no protect against STD's, because they are porous. The pores are small enough to stop sperm from getting through, but not small enough to keep bacteria and viruses from getting through.<br>  <br>  However, all latex and polyurethane condoms protect against both pregnancy and STD's.

RzY6EbVUaa	Just about all of my friends say that if they had the chance they would save it.  They all regret it, in other words.  And they are all guys, so that is pretty unusual, huh?  Now, since you are a girl, and I'm assuming you are not a whore, you will most likely regret it at your age now.  It may seem cool to lose it, or something to look forward to, but in the end you will wish you thought otherwise.  Trust me, no matter what the circumstances are, you will wish you hadn't.  Oh, my friends are 17, so just about your age.|`|1cYPOJkqaa	I'm the same way and I'm 16 too. I'm not planning to lose it until I'm at least 19.

Also, make sure you are prepared.|`|cR2Eb5p7aa	I'd say you'd have to have a mature mentality, around 16+ (if it's the legal age, like in some US states and the UK, but 18+ otherwise) and if you're comfortable with the person you're with.<br>  <br>  That's my opinion anyway.

Basically, it's all about how many calories you put in. I'll tell you that I actually went vegan and lost no weight until I made the effort. That should tell you something. It's all about your activity level and your food intake. You still want to eat well-rounded meals. There's no reason you should just pound twinkies and pizza. Just eat more of it. Have 2-3 servings instead of just 1, and you'll be well on your way! <br>  <br>  We also have some recipes users post, and it's a whole community...and it's free, of course.

Oc46e9xQaa	Make sure you talk to someone who is not in your family too.  If you are really having these serious issues like you mentioned a talk with a counselor at school, or one of your friends parents might give you some other options.  Don't be afraid to talk to someone and get help.  Just because people are our family members doesn't always mean  they are people we are meant to be with.  I hope that makes sense.  <br>  <br>  Make sure when you talk to someone that you are honest with them and very open.  They can only help you if you have described your problems accurately.  You may have to talk to more than one person before you find someone who can truly help.  <br>  <br>  Hang in there.

Best thing to do is consult a dr or advice nurse depending on if you have insurance or not. Usually a doc can listen to your stomach for sounds relating to food poisoning. If it came and went that fast it probably was related to the spice or could be a virus going around.

Same with girls and their breasts|`|ZkwtldYlaa	You should be happy with what you have.<br>  <br>  However if you really feel the need to increase your penis size,then you should try out these :<br>  <br>  Here are four good natural penis enhancement techniques I recommend for rookies. Done properly and consistently, they should add close to an inch or two to your penis in six weeks.<br>  <br>  1. Penis stretches. This one is very simple. Just take your flaccid penis and stretch it as far out in front of your body as it will go. Do it gently and gradually and hold it there for thirty seconds. Rest ten seconds between sets and repeat this at least ten times.<br>  <br>  2. Jelqing. This is another great technique for rookies. Get your penis halfway erect, apply lubrication, and grip it tightly at the base with the thumb and forefinger of one hand. Slowly slide that hand up the shaft toward the tip, pushing as much blood into your penis as possible. When you reach the tip, immediately grip the base the same way using the other hand and repeat. Do this nonstop for ten minutes.<br>  <br>  3. Ulis. This is a great exercise to increase girth. It is also very easy and does not take much time. Achieve a full erection and grip the base of your penis the same way you would if you were jelqing. <br>  <br>  Squeeze as hard as you can without causing discomfort. Your penis shaft should swell and your penis head should get big and shiny. Hold for ten seconds and rest for ten seconds. Repeat this three or four times.<br>  <br>  Do this routine every other day and make sure you warm your penis up before each workout by wrapping it in a hot washcloth for five minutes.<br>  <br>  4. A larger penis can be achieved with the use of penis enhancers. There are many forms of penis enhancement products such as pills, patches and topical oils. However, one unique natural product that can produce significant results and makes use of the body's natural abilities comes in the form of a liquid called super-vir <a href="http://www.super-vir.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-vir.com</a><br>  <br>  Always remember, if you are not satisfied with what you were born with, it is never too late to do something about it!|`|nA1g26y0aa	This answer is not based on any "source" other than my own experience. I'm not sure how "big" my penis was when I was 13 or 14. But I do remember looking at other guys (in the showering after P.E. in the locker room) and I think we were all about the same size. I never measured then, of course. Now, I measure about 6.5" long and 4.75" around. The literature I've read states that the range of the adult penis is 5 to 7 inches, so...since there is nothing you can do to actually lengthen your penis....accept it and realize that your penis does not control your life!|`|fadeVH4baa	If you're using this site as a source, it isn't that reliable.<br>  <br>  Theres teenagers on here insecure about their current penis size and they need to come on here and say they're "9 inches" just to make themselves feel better.<br>  <br>  Guys be happy with what you've got.|`|TOlTAolRaa	lol idk.. i always thought that evo **** took forever.. lol<br>  maybe yur just mistaken..<br>  im 15 and almost 8 inches.. but i hit puberty at about 13 so its prob done growing..<br>   xD maybe its bc back then the kids wore their pants so high it jammed their ***** back inside lmao|`|4PprWjilaa	dont know like i agree and puberty people say that u start growing body and face hair about 18 up well im 14 and already got chest and face hair lol   and y say that penis size increasing is a bad thing its good|`|GKFv4G2uaa	Chemicals in the things we eat.

FU4TyghIaa	Riding a bike huh?<br>  Riding a bike, depends on what gears you use and what resistance you get, like riding up hills and stuff.  That can develop the muscles to be lean and fine, or fat and bulky depending what you go for.  Mixing it up will help.  Ride in low gears where it's easy to peddle but you spin around.  Ride in high gears where you peddle slow but it's harder to push.  Then, when you're doing that, you might have a tendency to stand up on the peddles (off the seat) to get more force.  Try not to do that but stay on the saddle.  It works more leg muscles and the control you have to exert to do that develops  those muscles not used directly in the peddling.<br>  <br>  Apart from that, get them to run in the top paddock away from the rest of the herd.  Then it will be easier to see them and you won't get them confused with the rest of the cattle.|`|UjUmtGWzaa	BICYCLE!

xmibEEdcaa	My experience with nerve pain has been very similar to yours, although mine is a facial neuralgia, rather than lingering neuralgia from an injury.<br>  <br>  There are quite a few anti-convulsants recommended for nerve pain, and some of them have a higher success rate than neurontin. Tell your neurologist that the neurontin isn't doing anything and ask if there's another anti-convulsant you might try. Tegretol and its relative Trileptal often work where neurontin does not, although they have more side effects, many of which kind of suck.  Still, if you can find an anti-convulsant that works on your pain, I promise that you'll like it far better than the opioids!  Because when they work, they really do work, and they can keep you pain-free for quite a while.<br>  <br>  As for the pain meds...yeah, that's always tricky, because you have to strike that balance between asking for what you need while not sounding like a drug seeker.  But really, if you just explain that the neurontin is doing nothing, and that you'd like something for the pain to tide you over until you find a new drug that does work, your neurologist ought to be able to see the wisdom in that.  If not, then you should seriously consider going to a pain management clinic, or finding a pain management specialist. They're often more realistic about chronic pain than the neurologists and GPs are.<br>  <br>  Finally, you may run into doctors who insist that "opioids aren't effective against nerve pain."  I have no idea why so many people believe this, because my experience and the experience of many people I've talked to has been just the same as yours: the opioids don't make the pain go away, but they do knock it down a few notches on the pain scale -- and those two or three notches can really make all the difference when you're trying to function halfway normally with chronic pain.  I hope you don't run into one of those doctors, because there's really no way to argue the point with them without sounding like an addict.  If you do get one of those, again, your best bet is probably to find a pain management clinic, where the staff tends to be a bit more likely to actually listen to what their patients say about their pain.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|13dd1300afaebe4b25cb9bccb97c988baa	simply tell the doctor the medicine she is trying you on isn't helping and tell her what does work..maybe she can switch to something similiar to vicodan that will help.|`|FjIND80Gaa	IT's VICODIN!

I am not sure if you realize that vycodin is a drug that you can become addicted to, and there are more deaths from people overdosing on pain meds than from car wrecks, also, your Dr. can get into a lot of trouble over prescribing an addictive pain med for too long a time, you can switch Dr.'s , but then you are red marked,or  ear marked as a potentical addict. Stick with the simple stuff and have a good and safe life. They have pain management clinics and they do help. Good luck to you.

NB4h4jTyaa	There is nothing wrong with eating healthfully and exercising at your age, but don't stress about the number on the scale.

mSjglSI6aa	Feeling anemic may actually be too much sugar.  High blood pressure runs in your family because of diet and environmental issues, not genetics.  If you eat like your family, you will get sick like your family.  <br>  <br>  I don't know of anything in the supplement you are thinking of taking which would be an issue, but many of the nutrients in it are probably soy derived (manufactured).  That should give you pause.  The supplement would also most likely just be a band-aid at best. <br>  <br>  Instead, try cutting all refined sugars, including high fructose corn syrup, white sugars, etc., out of your diet.  Do not substitute with aspartame or Splenda, those are just as bad.  Instead try using turbinado (unrefined sugar) for baking and Stevia for sweetening drinks.  That will help cut down your sugar load and with those anemic feelings.  You might also add caffeine to the no-no list. <br>  <br>  To pump up the iron in your bloodstream, start adding organic raisins and organic spinach to your diet.  They have higher concentration of iron, and though it doesn't look like a lot, it actually is more readily absorbed by your body.  This is what I've done when I felt my iron was low.  <br>  <br>  Also, consider having your thyroid, adrenals and hormones testes.  You don't have to see a doctor for that, you can order tests and send them back to the lab, which will then send you the results.  You can treat thyroid, adrenal and hormone issues without docs too.  That's for another post.  <br>  <br>  Check here: <a href="http://www.salivatest.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.salivatest.com</a> for tests.  <br>  <br>  You also should probably cut fluoride out of you life - yes fluoride.  It causes many problems in the systems which could be causing you to feel anemic.  No, you do not need fluoride to keep your teeth healthy.  Cavities are mostly caused by refined white sugar and refined white flour.  Get rid of those, and you are keeping your teeth much safer. <br>  <br>  Another item in your household which could be causing a drain on your system is triclosan.  It is the "anti-bacterial" of anti-bacterial everything.  Unfortunately, we are being inundated with it, and it causes thyroid issues, which mimic anemic symptoms.  You can now find this dangerous chemical in your toothpaste, deodorant, and other personal care items, in additions to soap and cleaners.  Make sure you get items that DON'T say "anti-bacterial" and look on the label for this ingredient.  <br>  <br>  If you are sensitive to MSG, then chances are good you are sensitive to the above mentioned chemicals too.  Hopefully a few changes in the environment around you and items you use will help.  <br>  <br>  FWIW - naturopaths are significantly cheaper than MDs, and twice as good with things like this.  They can often do the same testing too, and charge less.  You might get a recommendation for a good one if the above doesn't seem to help you feel better.|`|9pLdhuBnaa	It is probably ok to take but I would recommend checking with your pharmacist as well.<br>  <br>  In the mean time here's the link to a site that might help you find more information.

eGMBgBlLaa	Feed your metabolism. It sleeps when you do and it doesn't wake up again until you eat your first meal of the day. The best way to boost it is eat 1-2 bananas in the morning, eat healthy foods, light snacks through the day and don't eat after 8pm.|`|rVbY5qBsaa	Start off with light exercising (you need to in order to lose weight). Perhaps walking. Drink a lot of water and avoid fried food.|`|YRB0jIRraa	no worries...<br>  <br>  WELL... Eat Vegetables, Fruits, Nuts, Wholegrains (Brown rice, Buckwheat pasta, Wholegrain Pasta, Wholemeal crackers... pretty much everything Brown... Stay away from White foods, like white bread etc.) Eat more lean protein, fish and chicken. Try Soy/skim or low fat milk instead of High fat dairy milk. Opt for low sugar yoghurts & try and reduce the amount of cheese you eat.<br>  <br>  I would suggest saving up for a Gym membership... I just started & I absolutely love it. Walking & swimming are good exercises when you're starting out to build your fitness.<br>  <br>  Good luck! & don't worry 65 kilo's isn't that heavy at all... but I recon once you start eating better food and getting into exercise you will feel alot better and more motivated.<br>  <br>  Love Emma Kate.|`|sEFCfHjWaa	Try not to eat red meat and maybe instead of coffee (if you drink coffee) drink green tea. It's a great anti-toxin. Try to buy fruit- I know that no 15 year old wants to eat the stuff most people tell you to eat, so try fruit instead of the stuff that teen girls crave, like chocolate and pizza.|`|gl1W4qFbaa	i would recommend the trim fit system to you but your a bit young to start this system. Its really effective and works great, but since you are 15. The thing i would recommend you to do is to just exercise and eat less fatty foods.|`|S1cEi63Qaa	You need to eat healthy. You shouldn't eat junk food, nor drink soda often. You'll need to drink lots of water, and take walks after your meal.|`|HjWYfztzaa	well since you are only 15 you don't need to worry about it a lot... just wait... however if you really want to just keep eating healthy and don't wat junk food and exercise at least 1 hr each day... that's my advice... GOOD LUCK!!!!!|`|Qe5MqiRvaa	green tea. its pretty good, helps detox your body, and speeds up your metabolism. also citrus helps burn fat:)
4wElyXcraa	She can start by calling the village or the town she lives in.  They'll prolly refer her to the health department.<br>  <br>  There are many departments that can get involved, but the health department is best. <br>  <br>  I used to have a friend that worked for the health department and he said that no building on earth can pass all the rules and regulations that they have.  The health department can make it hell on earth for anyone.<br>  <br>  It wouldn't hurt to have a note from the doctor stating that mold is making the matter worse<br>  <br>  BUT, keep in mind that the landlord will not be a happy camper and that the tenant will be caused to jump thru hoops and most likely their life will be made miserable, too.  The apartment had better be clean.  The rent paid up to date etc.  Read the lease and follow every comma<br>  <br>  Sometimes with mold it is a matter of ripping out and rebuilding which would involve a relocation for a time period.<br>  <br>  Since mold can be serious-there are different kinds, your friend might consider and should start looking around for someplace else to live.<br>  <br>  Even if the mold thing is cared for, and I say "If",  the landlord is gonna get nasty.  I'm sure the health department will find several things that need to get attention which means money.  Most landlords I have dealt with are allergic to spending money.<br>  <br>  Good luck   <br>  <br>  PS  Best thing to do is to document the mold (especially if it is the bad kind of mold) and use that as an excuse to break the lease and to simply move.|`|ghuylY92aa	I have worked in apt. Industry for a couple of years, every state has an apt. association (example Northern Nevada Apt. ***.) that can A. Point your friend in the right direction on who to contact, and B. Penalize or close the complex that your friend lives in.  Also if she is going to clean it herself, she should get a dehumidifier and buy some thick plastic gloves and use bleach to clean it. <br>  <br>  But the apt. owner/manager should really really be responsible to clean it or transfer her to another apt. at no cost. Good luck!|`|Vcg2QuDWaa	I would get a mildew killer and do it myself.  Where does she have the mold and mildew?  Also she could get a dehumidifier and run that in the apartment so it is dry.  Good Luck!!|`|U95m4LhAaa	OSHA?<br>  <br>  Or she can actually run the heat and a/c when appropriate.  When it's cold outside, use the heat in the apartment.  When it's hot outside, use the a/c.  A neighbor of mine had the same problem and they blamed the front office but lo and behold I don't have that problem at all because I actually run my heat and a/c when needed instead of my neighbors who NEVER ran the stuff and had mold growing up the walls and windows.  It was always humid in their apartment and they never ran the apartment like they should have.|`|0yQxn9j9aa	com\ntact the housing department, and ask for a copy of the landlord tenant rights for your state and county. then ask them to schedule a walk through of your friend's apartment. <br>  <br>  you can probably download a copy of your county's landlord/ tenant right's and responsibility\ies act right off the internet just go to your county housing or health department website, but each county is different then call them to schedule a walk through on monday, if they decide they are in violation they will handle it from there.\, and tell her exactly what to do.|`|7fYIIhiSaa	go to the health department and ask them. They need to move out immediately!|`|ne0EjucSaa	contact health deparment
iPsFTNivaa	Let your mom know that your teeth are sore and ask for some ibuprofin (Advil, Aleve, Motrin).  If you take the ibuprofin every 4-6 hours like instructed, that will help with your discomfort.  Also, until the soreness goes away, try eating softer foods.<br>  To answer your question about if it hurts when braces are removed---no, it shouldn't hurt.  We have a special plier (a debonding plier) that grips the bracket.  All we do is twist that plier a small bit and it will break the bond between the bracket and the tooth.  Some of the glue will be on the bracket and some will remain on the teeth.  Depending on your orthdontist, the remaining glue will either be scaled off your teeth or removed with a handpiece.  A handpiece is like a drill but it doesn't hurt.  They just run the burr of the drill over the surface of your tooth to remove the glue.  It doesn't hurt, it just vibrates.  But it is faster than removing glue with a scaler.  I hope I've helped!  And congrats on getting your braces off soon!  :)|`|AA11263103	You get used to the pain when tighten. Just lots of pain killers!! <br>  I just got my off about 2 weeks ago! and they cliped them off the rings then riped them off my teeth!!  Then the pain goes away!! And have really pretty teeth

MTF0Rz90aa	Sorry to hear your problem, sex is supposed to be enjoyable and not pain full.<br>  When was the last time you were at the doctors to have yourself checked out?<br>  Some times after sterilisation women can develop extra material around the womb/cervix area. This can some times result in a condition called endometriosis.<br>  Recent evidence from the medical community think that this is causes by an excess of insulin in the body so the current thinking is to prescribe met-formic acid (used in some diabetic treatments). This normalises the womb thickness and can be a real improvement to your sex life.<br>  My advice would be to see your GP explain the problem and get a Gyni referral.<br>  Good luck.<br>  Ja.|`|0DmLROo3aa	if your partners dick is like some jumbo nuclear reacter dick then maybe its pushing the wall  inside your vagina to much and ripping it <br>  so dont have sex if you dont wnnt to lay it offf and tell him his ddick is to big and its hurting you <br>  you may have edminsteriolis it happens when the wall in your vagina blocking the penis from going any further rips.<br>  that suckes you may die or have to have surgery<br>  and dont have sex so much and dont do it either|`|OEwJBdGpaa	probably worth a trip to ur gyno...i had to get a smear test for bleeding after sex and everything was fine but best to rule out anything else|`|DkzPVgf3aa	it may  be endomitriosis|`|6o4iqjPgaa	unless ur partner has a freakin baseball batt as a dick i dunno|`|CqcEhI2Kaa	Is your partner... big?<br>  <br>  The natural length from the surface to the cervix is about 7-8 inches.

N1UOHz58aa	We can't answer ur ? u got to because ur the only one who knows the answer.|`|MRtgpHGwaa	YES! When I was in 5th-8th grade, I worried about EVERYTHING! Im not going to be one of those idiots that say "Don't worry. Everythings going to be fine," because thay thought about it too. But when you get in to high school, nothing matters. You want good grades, get into collage, and the only people that DO worry THAT much, are the cheerleaders, and the people who want to be models. Hope I helped Sweetie!|`|dALX1qQdaa	everyone is during middle school!!|`|RTHWQvkzaa	It could be stress from schoolwork, if you are having trouble in shcool. You may kind of like a guy and are feeling confused, not understanding how yuo feel or if you like him caus eit may be your first time. Could just be from growing :) You may be worried about being popular but dont worry. In 6th grade I ha dlike one friend. Now in middle school (7th grade) I hhave a lot of friends, and I am just average. Not popular, but average. And its great. You dont need to be popular to have awesome friends, if thats what you are worried about.|`|ua39Gavuaa	5th grade? dont worry, just enjoy elementary school :)|`|VP7A10bXaa	you do realize that you have to be at least 12 to use Y!A right?|`|Wf2EygGpaa	its probally just anxiety. just relax. i get that sometimes. just remember that nothing is gonna happen to you. <br>  hope this helps <br>  :-]]|`|XCrPWQh8aa	Everyone's different... it might just be your personality.

Idk if you can get them there, but I get them everywhere else! =o) I think you shouldn't talk to your doctor, but E-MAIL him/her. Or if you dint want to go through all that work, ask on one of those anonymous HELTH websites, not Yahoo! answers. Hope it all works out Sweetie! =o)|`|mhp7JKMNaa	Pop it with a toothpick to find out. jk.<br>  <br>  It's just a cluster, everyone gets them, they fade away.|`|AA12198724	That sounds like an ingrown hair. If you shave then what happened is that the hair is growing back underneath the skin. Just leave it alone. If you pop it pus comes out and it leaves an awful scar.  You can put a warm rag over it for a few minutes and then rinse with some anti bacterial soap. The next time you shave though just shave in a slow downward motion and clean the area with safeguard or any other type of anti bacterial body soap. Also wearing 100% cotton panties (that are NOT thongs or really tight) can help since ingrown hairs kind of trap bacteria. Once when I had ingrown hairs my GYN gave me anti biotics so keeping that area free from bacteria with the tips I left above hopefully will help.|`|ZLrxqGT5aa	it could just be normal you know. if its red then you're probably just looking at the vaginal wall. however, i would go to the doctor if you are really worried about it. : )|`|uNC5VtD3aa	it could be a spot. like an acne spot. <br>  <br>  Wait and see if it goes anyway itself but if it gets worse go to a clinic.|`|TtN2uZUuaa	This might be a weird answer, But um.. It could be a pimple. Some girls get pimples there so it possibly could be one. But don't pop it. Let it leave on its own. And if it's not a pimple than maybe you should tell your mom and if it gets worse you defiantly have to tell your mom.|`|Q2dJhKJraa	Hmmm. Thats a little bit weird since your not sexually active. <br>  Honestly, i would go to a clinic, they are free and tell them. <br>  I would tell my mom as well, im sure she will find a clinic and hospitals are required to treat you even if you dont have insurance. <br>  Go to a doctor.....only solutions....|`|RTHWQvkzaa	Just wait. It may take a few weeks but it will go away eventually. Don't worry. I mean, if it gets really really bad then yeah tell your mom but if its just a bump then wait for a while. it may take a long time but it will go away.|`|QyQ6XoLbaa	If I were you, I would not try to pop it.  It could be an infected gland or something.  My gut reaction is to take a few warm baths and see what happens.  That should promote healing (warmth draws blood to an area and thus helps along the healing process.).|`|99d68503bd64f77c528862ddca9213f8aa	If you have been sick or had some sort of infection lately, it could be swollen lymph nodes in your groin. They usually go away after a few weeks and are perfectly normal.|`|7tD0HgwIaa	it can happen if u dont wear underwear and u wear jeans without underwear that can get very irrited! DO NOT POP IT!!!!! and i dont think it is std related.

It could be sleep paralysis too, I have that and it's hard to breath when that happens.|`|w5ACVjHuaa	You should definately get this checked.  Shortness of breath is never good.

If the pain persists, see a doctor.
45qyvYU2aa	Amputation doesn't solve pain, for the most part, unless the part is affected with decreased vascular flow, which doesn't sound like the case here.  There also aren't many good ankle prostheses and her insurance would probably not cover it if she went through it.  I think you're going to be extremely hard-pressed to find a surgeon who would amputate in this case because your mother would not be pleased with the results.  Patients that aren't pleased quickly become plaintiffs willing to sue the doctor that mutilated them.|`|exMPHWKHaa	I understand how difficult this is for you. Oxycodone is not that strong though I recommend getting prescribed morphine for the pain this should be an improvment. You need to explain how much pain she is in.  Good luck.|`|4NiRJZkAaa	Amputation won't stop the pain, It is inflamed, and needs redoing !|`|LMoJl7hFaa	Why does she have the pain?

09db70825677bbcf722475d2959af94eaa	The egg is released about halfway through the menstrual cycle.  If you have a 28 day cycle it would be released around the 14 day mark - your period would start somewhere in between 21-28 days.  That being said - it varies - some people release earlier in their cycle or later and it changes month to month due to stress and other things like that.<br>  Hope I helped|`|RTHWQvkzaa	I don't know but i just wanted to sya I think it was mean of that person to tlel you not to ask that.

hvqj7e0Daa	McDonald's.|`|p6I881Lwaa	Try not to get too stressed. Stress makes you lose weight. Don't drink a lot of fluid, because it will fill up your stomach and it won't leave much room for food. You can also try to rest a lot during the day, and not walk as much. If you do, don't move very fast. You might have high metabolism so you burn your calories very fast. The most effective weight gain is if you eat a lot of junk food I think, which won't probably suite you.|`|RvddYKqjaa	Follow me around and eat what I eat!  It works for me!  Go to Wendy's and get those nice fattening Frosty drinks. Drink one every day. Ensure really doesn't help you gain weight. It just provides nutrition for those who aren't eating or who need a supplement. You can drink a lot more fattening drinks than that one. You've gotten some good hints from others!|`|F2D1W4Kpaa	ok, well i don't know if this will help or not, but you can start eating tons MORE of steak, chicken, fruit, milk, vegetables, cheese, different types of nuts and DEFINITELY chocolate. But I am NOT telling you to force your self to over eat, but just try to eat more of that stuff and you should get fatter. Also another tip is, walk down the snacks isle in the grocery stores, and look the the MOST oily (as in it will make you fat) foods, and you should be gaining some weight!!!!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|rY84Ap6Maa	eat 2500 calories+ a day. 3000 is good. drink sodas and eat pasta and pizza and ice cream and cake. you can gain 10-20 pretty fast.|`|MlQ0GIpoaa	Get pregnant!|`|gl1W4qFbaa	nice... go to mc.donalds for lunch everyday. That'll do the trick haha|`|b2x7m7i8aa	it's easier to gain weight than to loose it. don't stuff yourself, you'll feel terrible. how to gain weight is all based on age. if your a teenager don't try to gain weight because your short, you just haven't grown yet. if your an adult then try eating peanut butter, chips, cookies, chocolate and ice cream. you should be happy your skinny most people want to loose weight not gain it. be happy with who you are. : )|`|HjWYfztzaa	who cares if you are underweight if you gain weight you are probably going to wish you were little again... i know i would rather be skinny than fat|`|1Qxe2Sjhaa	baby ruth candy bars!!!

If you're prone to high fevers, don't go to the hospital, unless it reaches above 105. Take some ibuprofen or tylenol to take the fever down. Feel better!
coPtU10Laa	Time to move on leave the past in the past. Try and see her again and concentrate on letting her know how proud you are of who she is now. Don't bring up the past unless she does, If she does apologize for being wrong in not being able to trust her. Sounds like now you can see the proof in her action that she really did mean to change. Try writing her and telling her how you feel again leave the past behind. Jesus admonished us to forgive and forget.Forget the past and never bring it up again. Tell her how much you love and ask her to give you a second chance to show how much. Don't be hypocritical you have to really forgive for this to work and be willing to except what ever she chooses to give you and maybe in time she'll learn to trust you again.|`|K0FabRAIaa	Just remain as loving as you can to her. She still has some growing up to do, and might eventually realize it is nice to have parents in her life.<br>  <br>  Consider writing her a letter. Try explaining your actions and what you intended to accomplish with the punishment. Tell her you hope one day she will forgive you. Then drop it. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately if you weren't there for her as loving supportive parents, she may not see any reason to reestablish ties, but hopefully deep within her heart she misses the parent/child relationship and will come along.|`|70At0HClaa	when we teenagers we take everything parents say to heart and remember, maybe in some cases never forgive or forget, i would suggest writing her a letter telling her you made mistakes and may not have said the right things at the time, but you have always loved her and still do. if there is something you have done or said that she is holding on to, ask her to put it in a letter and when you read it take how she felt on board and write a reply accepting her feelings, and if you were in the wrong for things said apoligise but say it was all done with the best intent for her and her future. ask her if you can draw a line under it and start again fresh, i'm sure she just waiting to know you love her unconditionally and she will come round if she knows this. good luck.|`|N5Yx86sYaa	Because, all of our lives until we are teens we relished in the idea of pleasing our parents, but as we got older, they no longer seemed perfect,actually they were a bit annoying and naive, thats when we rebel, it was nothing personal really, just a kid wanting to have fun...

As you test over time the line should get darker. You can get a blood pregnancy test at a doctor's office to be sure.

If you start as early as 16 you are bound to be so hooked by 21.  Get you BF to stop.  He doesn't need alcohol.  Having an alcoholic mate will ruin your life.

(if that's what you are implying) It is unsafe and downright dumb. However, so many teens drink that I can understand where the pressure comes from. I do not necessarilly see it as a personal weakness, but rather an inevitable phase(for SOME teens). So what I am basically saying is, just because your boyfriend drinks occasionally does not make him a bad or irresponsible person. As long as he does just that--drink only occasionally, does not pressure you to drink, and does not allow his drinking to harm you or others, or himself--which is not always easy for a 16 year old to do.|`|Dgcr4bvpaa	No because if you drink at a young age, your body is not  immune to it your body's reaction can be unsafe and addicting. Maybe not one drink, but after a while it can be dangerous. It can lead to many problems, such as addicting, anger issues, suicide, child abuse, etc. i recommend not drinking at a young age as 10-18. maybe 19, and 20 but not a high influence of it.|`|45qyvYU2aa	According to the U.S. government, no.  Teens who drink underage have a higher incidence of sexually-transmitted diseases, car accidents, and are raped at a much higher rate than teens who choose not to drink, just to name a few things.

As contacts get older, a film starts to coat the lens and does not allow the eye to "breathe".  Put new contacts in and it will be better for your eyes.

They can be just some brown spotting or last for 3-10 days depending on the person.  Some girls even miss a few months until their hormones develop.  When you get regular, your period will start anywhere from 25-35 days apart and all are normal, but most are usually about 28 days.<br>  <br>  welcome to womanhood..|`|ZLrxqGT5aa	could well be your period that has started. the blood is usually dark and brown at first. <br>  could also be an infection.<br>  wait a while to see if it is your period, if not then you need to go and see a doctor. <br>  hope that helps!

She was a late bloomer and it took her till she was about 17-19 to fully develop. And you've got to remember that your breast size will change with age and as you get older. We never stop developing. That's the thing about it. And remember that size doesn't matter. There's beauty in all sizes.|`|04F4149yaa	Wait 4 years honey.

jcXsclHYaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  This is what I would suggest:<br>  1. Diet: very important when trying to lose weight. You should eat often but little - let's say 5 meals (small) instead of 3 big. Lots of fruits and vegetables should be included in your diet. Also water is very important so try to drink about 8 glasses a day.<br>  2. Exercising - try to do some jogging and/or swimming 5 times a week for about 30 - 40 minutes. It will not only help you to lose weight but it will also keep you fit.<br>  <br>  And last word: when trying to lose weight do not rush -it takes time so be patient.|`|isZ8eb98aa	Do not skip meals, for one. Try working out on a treadmill or elliptical train for 45 minutes a day. Eat sensibly, and try not to eat too many bad fats and sugar-y drinks. <br>  Drink plenty of water, also.<br>  If you're a compulsive snacker (I am sometimes, too) then don't have chips and cookies and stuff around; keep fresh cut vegetables and fruits around.<br>  Also, juices and fruit punches can be really high in sugar.<br>  DO NOT try to cut out a bunch of the stuff you enjoy. You'll really hate your diet then. Also, don't do a fad diet- like grapefruit or Jell-O diet. You'll lose weight quickly, but you're more likely to gain it back quickly as well.<br>  <br>  Join a gym, if you can, or a team sport, or a yoga or step class.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  -Tila|`|Zc986zoBaa	There is no diet that will fix your personal body issues forever. It's time for a life change that makes you enjoy the foods you eat and eat them regularly. Snacks are actually a great thing! Find something healthy like fruits or veggies you enjoy. Those are what I snack on and also eat what should be dinner at 5:00 a.m. That way I'm full most of the day and don't even think about eating. I lost 40 pounds in 6 months without even thinking about it or dieting. By the way, I'm a picky eater also.

fAcVndo7aa	You didn't say if the medications were delivered to the camp, or if the campers' parents bring their meds.  One method we used when I managed care facilities was we had the patients' doctors or families use one specific pharmacy, who agreed to package each person's daily dose(s) in small zip-top bags with their names (for instance, one bag for Jane Doe would have four pills and a label that said her name, 8am, and the names of the pills).  It worked very well and made administration very simple.<br>  You can get more insights from someone currently in managed care - I'd see if you can find a Nurse Administrator at a nursing home or other long-term care facility and ask what they use.<br>  Good luck.

Repeat these. <br>  Also, you don't have to worry about getting huge muscly thighs with other exercises if you do not put enough food in for this to occur. What I mean is, if you eat small, healthy foods regularly, you will lose fat before it converts to muscle. <br>  I run in the mornings before breakfast because it helps your derrier but burns fat stored from last night's dinner as well!!|`|0kXlNWcMaa	do squats

AA11372037	There are a few thing I have heard of that could help. One thing you can try is washing your face once you've gotten out of bed. That makes you feel more refreshed and awake. Another thing is keep something that smells like mint or peppermint by your bed, like a mint scented candle or something. The smell of mint makes you feel more alert and awake. Hope this helps :)|`|aw5BGkmLaa	Go to bed early enough that you get 8 hours of sleep before you have to get up. This won;t work right away, it may take a week or two.<br>  <br>  Try to go to bed and get up at the same time every day, even weekends, which can get boring. If you stay up late on weekends, get up after 8 hours - do not let yourself sleep longer than 8.

xvey8ixPaa	Well, it is true things are going to look  smaller. Usually most people get used to this and do not notice it any longer. A way to get rid of some of this is to go to a thinner lighter weight lens that is an "aspheric" design. Without going in to any big explanation, this kind of lens decreases minification in a minus Rx and the magnification of a plus Rx. Anti Reflective coatings make a big difference as well. (good quality ones....they will have a 2 year warrant!) So, you can call your doctor's office and see if you can have a re-check if you still do not get used to it, but give it a couple of weeks, especially with astigmatism.

It is called "Act as If." When you are in a social situation, act as if you are outgoing. Talk more, smile at everyone, ask questions, speak in a normal or excited tone, not a meek tone. Watch some of your outgoing peers, and imitate the style of their social behavior. (I PRETEND that I'm an ACTOR, PLAYING a PART).<br>  Research shows that when you "act as if" continually, your image of yourself begins to conform to your new behavior. In this case, you will gain self-esteem and self-confidence, and begin to see yourself as socially normal, not shy. You will become more socially successful, and this will motivate you to continue your new social behavior until it becomes a habit. Try this for a month, in every situation you can. I am confident that you will become much more comfortable and outgoing.<br>  <br>  One form of therapy is to go somewhere that nobody knows you, and deliberately make an utter fool of yourself: put on a paper hat, and yell out: "I'm queen/king of America!", or something else ridiculous, (make up your own - have some fun, safely) then get back in the taxi, (warn the driver of your intentions, first) or car, and leave. People will point, and say: "Look at that idiot". But, you may not be up to the stage where you can do that, yet (I can, and I used to be shy). Or, preferably in the company of a friend, or family member, on a different train, or bus route to your regular one, call out the names, or numbers of all the stops. It will teach you that, although it isn't actually pleasant, (EXPECT MODERATE DISCOMFORT) you will survive; be stronger for the experience, and the next time (should you need to repeat this type of therapy) will be considerably easier. Remember: "A fear avoided is a fear strengthened; a fear faced is a fear reduced." Regard it as your final test: once you have accomplished it, the barrier will be broken; just don't go too far, the other way! Learn to laugh at yourself, and give a big, cheesy grin when others see you do something foolish, as we all do, occasionally.<br>  <br>  It is endearing, if you don't do it too often. Use positive affirmations: for example: "I am very likable and other people feel comfortable around me". Write down all of your self limiting beliefs; then write down the positive counter of them, (exact opposite) and repeat them and imprint them into your mind. Most importantly: Force yourself to approach somebody and initiate some sort of communication. Start out small by asking the time and directions and gradually go bigger. Although there are anti-anxiety medications (anxiolytics) available, these come with risks, and the possibility of side effects, habituation, even addiction, and withdrawal problems, and are unsuitable for young people. <br>  <br>  Try having a cup of "Tension Tamer", herbal tea, by Celestial Seasonings, (from supermarket tea, or health food aisles) or make some at home, and cool, then bottle, and drink as needed (I find it so strong tasting, that I need to drink it quickly, followed by something like fruit juice, to take away the taste, but others may find it more tolerable). C(h)amomile tea is a more palatable option. As with all herbal/green teas, use lemon/lime, and/or a little sweetener (NOT ARTIFICIAL!!!) but no cream, or milk. Xylitol, or Stevia is preferable, (health food stores) or fruit sugar (fructose, such as "Fruisana", from supermarket sugar aisles).

You  actually have watched your Grandma get on the floor and start licking shoes? Call her doctor and let them know if this is for real. Unfortunately the elderly can do odd things but you must get help for her. It is not cute, funny, or ok. You are probably young and haven't seen how older people can do strange, really strange, things when they are having medical problems. She may not be getting enough oxygen to her brain, or she may be having nutritional deficiencies. Strange cravings could be a part of that. Take the shoe polish in to the doctor so they can read the ingredients, it may just be alcohol that is her craving. Good Luck.|`|9YCmiewRaa	An old wino once told me he used to squeeze shoe polish through a coffee filter, and drink the liquid.

kh5vFblMaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Losing weight is not up to other people, it's up to you. But if you need a basic plan of working out, I'll try to help. The reason why it's up to you is, mostly, because I don't know how much time you have.<br>  <br>  Requirements: 1 hour, a set of dumbbells with 2 pounds each, an area to run (park or field is best), and a step counter (recommended)<br>  <br>  Routine:<br>  <br>  1. Warm up (IMPORTANT) <br>  A lot of people do warm up, but a lot of them don't warm up perfectly. <br>  <br>  First, loosen your muscles by stretching them: one arm over the other, hand behind back touching other hand, touch feet etc.<br>  <br>  Second, you now should do more than stretching. You should do jumping jacks, push ups, sit ups, mountain climber etc.<br>  <br>  Finally, you should start walking, until you finished 5 minutes from the time you started your warm up.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  2. Jogging -> Run -> Sprint<br>  My favorite part in the middle, will help you lose some weight, and help your body. You should first jog until you sweat, then run, and after running 5,000 to 10,000 steps, sprint for 200 steps, then run, and repeat until 1 hour.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  3. Cool down<br>  <br>  This is also important, yet not a lot of people actually do this. Now, you don't have to do the warm ups again, just walk 3 minutes, until your heartbeat is lowered.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  Hopefully, this helps!<br>  Sean<br>  <br>  Plus:<br>  <br>  Do not do this once a week, about 3+ times a week.|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	The key to starting an exercise routine is to make the changes slowly. You can't go from being sedentary to active overnight and hope to succeed. Start out by exercising 1-2 times per week and eventually moving up to 3-5 times per week. Only increase the amount of exercise you do per week when you feel ready.<br>  <br>  Exercise routines also have to be well rounded to be successful. You need elements of flexibility, cardiovascular and strength training. You don't need to go to the gym to get a good workout, but having access to that type of equipment is a definite plus. Flexibility isn't very intensive and can be done on most if not all days of the week. It won't directly help you with your goals but it will lead to better performance - it will make exercising a lot easier.<br>  <br>  Cardio should be done 3-5 times per week while strength training should be done 2-3 times per week. The more weight you want to lose, the more you need to exercise. If this seems confusing, you can get a free personalized workout routine at <a href="http://shtrainer.com" rel="nofollow">http://shtrainer.com</a>|`|iWat12yFaa	Heres some tips for making a good workout plan!

8yE2sYGeaa	Women often accuse men of not understanding the kind of pain that a period brings<br>  <br>  Getting hit in the balls is a kind of pain that women may not recognize. You friend showed all the signs of a classic ball strike.|`|E64juLwJaa	This is normal:he could even gone unconscious as well:happened to me once.911 took me to the ER :had emergency surgery:it was so messed up.<br>  So i can figure that he cried and threw up,<br>  Colors.|`|EcCbforQaa	It would not surprise me at all. That's a very tender area.|`|pRGYutc4aa	haha. Well if he got hit really bad i guess its okay to cry. I think throwing up is a little over the top though.|`|PwnRqFP3aa	depending on how hard you kicked him... one time my friend kicked me there, and i had a seizure, so ya, id say its normal|`|TGRUUWiwaa	I do that just thinking about it.|`|b8a51f5098090ab33a464a74631f3bd9aa	Oh hell yeah... it's a natural reaction to pain, at least one of many different reactions.  Our balls are the most sensitive part of our body. Some guys will hurt with just a tap, a little slap, flick...of course not as much as being hit, kicked punched, etc. If your poor friends was hit really hard (from his reaction, I'm assuming he was) his body reacted to the pain in it's own natural way.  Our bodies are amazing, and each one different from the other person, although they were made to work the same, each one of our bodies functions differently to get the work done.  In your friends situation, his body took over becasue his brain could not handel feeling so much pain...his body went into what I like to call "Hero Mode".  It had to react some how, in his case it was the tears and throwing up... this may have and more than likely did stop him from having a bigger problem than just the pain. It could have stopped him from passing out, going unconcious, having a seiger, you name it. There is only so much pain that our mind can deal with so our body's natural deffens has to kick in and do what it can. If the pain is to way to much then that's when you have the people that pass out from pain or what have you. This is very common when a woman gives birth, many pass out durring labor from the pain. You will never know exactly how your body will react to pain, so be nice... you maybe the one crying or throwing up next time.   :)|`|4pltQt5naa	H ell ya i do that any time i get hit in the sack it hurts like h ell it is the most unbearable pain i have ever felt|`|qeoVhRONaa	Yeah, thats normal. But guys deal with that pain in different ways. That pain is like hell. lol Its almost unbareable. It can make the toughest cry in pain.|`|rmU0nujMaa	well yea thats a guys most sensitive spot. i don't cry by i get cramps around the area which suck. everyone is different.|`|AA11170501	yes it is|`|fadeVH4baa	I suppose, if you get hit really bad.<br>  <br>  It mostly winds you.|`|c73AAq22aa	YES its a man thing<br>  he must been hit pretty hard|`|Z4OeKTToaa	hell yeah that has to be one of the worst pains ever i would rather have a tattoo than be kicked in the love spuds
djNeNEOuaa	I would say about 24 pounds if you lose Weight in a healthy manner. Below are some advice that may help you stick to your goal.<br>  <br>  Look at what you are about to undertake not as a short term, quick, weight loss, but rather a change in lifestyle to last a lifetime. You will begin to make more nutritious food choices, add exercise, and cut back somewhat on your eating. If you falter along the way, you don't need to look at it as a failure because you know that you have a long time to make the changes. <br>  <br>  Find a friend or family member that is willing to lose Weight with you. A very large percentage of people who fail to lose Weight do so from lack of support. This way you can help each other make proper neuronal chooses and make exercising together fun.<br>  <br>  When choosing an exercises don't choose one that will make you bored. Find something that involves walking or running that you can have fun doing such as frolfing. If exercising becomes a chore you will start to hate it. If you make it fun, however, you will start to look it and thus increase your chance of success.<br>  <br>  Losing one-half to one pound per week is very realistic. Don't drop your calorie intake to below 1,300 calories because it would be hard to get all the important nutrition that you need in less than that, plus, you won't feel satisfied. <br>  <br>  Find measures of success besides weight loss: This isn't just about losing weight, it's about getting healthier for good. So, don't measure your success merely on how much weight you lose. Other things you can look at may be the amount of time you spent being physically active and not watching television, an increase in endurance, or a day of making nutritious snack choices.<br>  <br>  Don't skip meals. Skipping meals can backfire. You may eat even more calories at your next meal and, because Youre so hungry, you'lll be more likely to eat junk food.<br>  <br>  Don't over exercise. Exercise can be a healthy way to manage weight, but too much can cause problems both physically and mentally. Some people even exercise so obsessively that it's considered a type of eating disorder.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck.|`|V20PTwMmaa	Figure -7lbs per month.  The slower you lose the longer you'll keep it off.|`|4vdtR7sSaa	well if u run on the tredmill at a fast distance per hour, you'll loose about 500 calories.. u'd prob loose like 1 pound per week if u keep this up ^_^|`|Ky3rQ3fYaa	How much you loose depends on your metabolism.  It is great that you are trying to do this now.  The younger you are when you obtain and healthy weight, the easier it is to maintain health --for example not getting diabetes, high blood pressure, etc.  <br>  <br>  If you cut all that stuff out would will lose a lot of weight.  Make sure you are replacing it with healthy high-protein choices like chicken, baked fish, ets.<br>  <br>  Your body mass index puts you at 25.5, which is just barely out of range of a healthy weight, so don't go losing too much, weight lifting is a good thing to build muscle bulk.|`|LtZ064eoaa	you would loose a lot like maybe up to 50 lbs or even more idk for sure but that sounds like a good plan especially since your a male you guys tend to loose it quicker and more ugh! but anyway good luck your diet sound strict and efficient|`|7nA2EiHVaa	plenty. my brother was exactly the same way and i would say he lost about ohhh a good 20-25 pounds in one football season.|`|8Z7bCyQOaa	look at this site. hopefully it will help u. it also has great links to other websites.<br>  www.healthisgreat.webs.com
IFL3GcM9aa	Aside from antihistimines, you can also use a sinus irrigator  or neti pot to flush the allergens out of your nose with a saline solution.  This will work for people who have non-allergic sinusitis as well as those with allergies.  The salt in the saline brings down swelling as well as gets the bad stuff out of your nose.|`|mdwyZpyHaa	You can try the nonsedating antihistamines such as Claritin, Zyrtec or Allegra.

In 6 days you may, gain a pound or 2 at the most and you would certainly lose it the next week when you were not on it.  <br>  <br>  If you  want to gain weight try drinking the high protein whey powder drinks.  It will help you to gain that muscle you want.  If you are not wanting to gain weight,  I don't think a 6 day regimen of methylprednisolone will effect you very much.|`|mAp90hEeaa	Every person's body is different - some people can take the weight back off easily - for others, it may take some hard work.  There is no way of knowing which category you fit into until you have been off of the medication for about a week and then see if the weight starts dropping or if you will have to diet some in order to get it back off.

They can be just some brown spotting or last for 3-10 days depending on the person.  Some girls even miss a few months until their hormones develop.

How about some more details on what prompted you to ask the question?
AA11804014	You don't have to tell your mother anything - but it would make sense to tell the doctor so they can institute proper health care procedures and exams and the like. The doctor is not going to tell your mother anything about your activities, but if you are concerned about it, TELL the doctor in no uncertain terms that they are not to say anything to her.|`|a7590c3c5bac6d04d5fbb3e0c50319baaa	Why are you going to the doc? I think the doc has to respect that you want that private and at your age, why a pelvic?|`|KL1Y5FeHaa	You are 16. You can go by yourself.|`|Njgof6hNaa	You have the option of being honest with her, if that's what you want.<br>  You also have the option of asking to have your visit private. Most doctors will respect that and given  your age that shouldn't be an issue. If you ask the doctor to keep things confidential, then that should be respected, because the doctor could lose their license otherwise. All stuff to keep in mind. <br>  If you want to be honest with your mom then the best way to do that is to sit her down and just tell her. There's no easy way to do this, but you'll get it out there.|`|UIF7OBuxaa	The doctor is OBLIGATED to keep your answers private.<br>  <br>  If you are wanting to tell your Mom, that could be a hard subject just to spring up, but maybe in the car on the way to the doctor explain your situation to her, or coming home from the doctor because she may get emotional, but I would definitely tell her before she finds out somehow.|`|AA12198724	You dont really have to. If you are going to the GYN then they will ask only to figure out which speculum to use but they keep it confidential. Its only a problem if you believe that you may be pregnant or have an STD.|`|n7A0oggOaa	well are you scared the doctor will find out you're sexually active?<br>  because he wont. he can only tell if you're hymen is broken. that can be broken from plenty of things, other than sex. don't worry about it. if you think its best for you, tell her. if not, don't worry about it, they wont find out for sure if you're sexually active, so you're mom wont either.|`|ewps7rb7aa	Why does she want to take you there?  She might just be taking you to show you how you should start to care for yourself ... yearlies, etc.   If she's taking you in for routine stuff, you don't have to divulge that info.  Many doctors know there's a chance you are and won't press the issue unless it's VERY important for them to know in order to treat you.|`|tb8MRMBcaa	well if you have to go to the doctors you can always ask your mum to wait outside while you get checked over buy yourself. <br>  or lie to the doctor i did when my mum came in and she still has no idea.

Thereafter it may be used weekly for maintenance.<br>  <br>  Botox - a neurotoxin injected into the skin after iodine and corn starch are used to identify location of overactive sweat glands. It works by temporarily blocking the chemical signals from the nerves that stimulate the sweat glands and lasts several months. It is also often covered by insurance.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Focus on the cause, not the symptom. View the information and weblinks for social anxiety/shyness, and self confidence, in sections 9, (read the whole section) and 38, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> Here is an exercise that can help you. It is called "Act as If." When you are in a social situation, act as if you are outgoing. Talk more, smile at everyone, ask questions, speak in a normal or excited tone, not a meek tone. Watch some of your outgoing peers, and imitate the style of their social behavior. (I PRETEND that I'm an ACTOR, PLAYING a PART).<br>  Research shows that when you "act as if" continually, your image of yourself begins to conform to your new behavior. In this case, you will gain self-esteem and self-confidence, and begin to see yourself as socially normal, not shy. You will become more socially successful, and this will motivate you to continue your new social behavior until it becomes a habit. Try this for a month, in every situation you can. I am confident that you will become much more comfortable and outgoing.<br>  <br>  One form of therapy is to go somewhere that nobody knows you, and deliberately make an utter fool of yourself: put on a paper hat, and yell out: "I'm queen/king of America!", or something else ridiculous, (make up your own - have some fun, safely) then get back in the taxi, (warn the driver of your intentions, first) or car, and leave. People will point, and say: "Look at that idiot". But, you may not be up to the stage where you can do that, yet (I can, and I used to be shy). Or, preferably in the company of a friend, or family member, on a different train, or bus route to your regular one, call out the names, or numbers of all the stops. It will teach you that, although it isn't actually pleasant, (EXPECT MODERATE DISCOMFORT) you will survive; be stronger for the experience, and the next time (should you need to repeat this type of therapy) will be considerably easier. Remember: "A fear avoided is a fear strengthened; a fear faced is a fear reduced." Regard it as your final test: once you have accomplished it, the barrier will be broken; just don't go too far, the other way! Learn to laugh at yourself, and give a big, cheesy grin when others see you do something foolish, as we all do, occasionally.<br>  <br>  It is endearing, if you don't do it too often. Use positive affirmations: for example: "I am very likable and other people feel comfortable around me". Write down all of your self limiting beliefs; then write down the positive counter of them, (exact opposite) and repeat them and imprint them into your mind. Most importantly: Force yourself to approach somebody and initiate some sort of communication. Start out small by asking the time and directions and gradually go bigger. Although there are anti-anxiety medications (anxiolytics) available, these come with risks, and the possibility of side effects, habituation, even addiction, and withdrawal problems, and are unsuitable for young people. <br>  <br>  Try having a cup of "Tension Tamer", herbal tea, by Celestial Seasonings, (from supermarket tea, or health food aisles) or make some at home, and cool, then bottle, and drink as needed (I find it so strong tasting, that I need to drink it quickly, followed by something like fruit juice, to take away the taste, but others may find it more tolerable). C(h)amomile tea is a more palatable option. As with all herbal/green teas, use lemon/lime, and/or a little sweetener (NOT ARTIFICIAL!!!) but no cream, or milk. Xylitol, or Stevia is preferable, (health food stores) or fruit sugar (fructose, such as "Fruisana", from supermarket sugar aisles).|`|PbCeuT36aa	I have the same ****, but mine is a less severe case.  I'm not that much of a social person, and hate school.  I get paranoid, I get sweaty hands but not all the time.  Only when I'm holding hands with someone or when it's hot.  I don't think the sweats on your hands are from anxiety.  It is some type of disease or sickness, I read about it.  Your hands are always getting sweaty.  Go to a doctor and he will prescribe you some ****.  As for not liking being around people, maybe you smoked too much weed for far too long and now are paranoid like I am.|`|Ya8RcJpuaa	I get sweaty palms a lot with my anxiety, just find a way to get the energy out some place else.  I bounce my knees, that always helps me, and focusing on breathing slowly can usually snap you out of it too.  Basically your brain freaks out over something you're not even thinking about, just give it something to concentrate on for a minute until it passes.|`|DAtqr0QHaa	Everyone sweats more than someone else some where.<br>  Armpit, back, neck, hands..<br>  There's a prescripion medicine that you put on your hands and rub lightly and put plastic gloves on for the night.<br>  Hope that helped some...<br>  Good luck, :]|`|upx2bF4Waa	Meditation can help you about your anxiety. All you have to do is to learn how to do it.|`|3MsuKdNFaa	oh man, i totally know what your going through... ive had social anxiety dissorter since i was younger but its gotten worse these last 3 years, and now i cant even talk to people at school so i really really do know what your going through. idk how to get your hands to stop sweating though.. you should talk to a Doctor.. im just starting to be medicated for social anxiety  so i don't know how well it helps yet. but yeah talk to a doctor and see if theirs anything they can do. i really didn't want to at first but it had to be done. so ask your parents to help you if you want. good luck|`|9syEUfnqaa	well first of all, you should probably go see a doctor to check things out, but the last thing you need are pills. so scratch that out..im shy too, but i just act like theyre regular people like us, it might help to picture everyone as flowers..(it helps me) and as for the relationship, you cant let it get in the way, if you tell them they'll understand.everyones palms get sweaty just like yours. just take a deep breath and and wipe your hands=)|`|0fys57BNaa	Hey, based on what you have said it looks like your anxiety is a trigger for the sweaty palms and also that this is probably just a phase because you mentioned that it just started happening this year.  I remember that age and I had really bad anxiety and was abnormally shy.  One thing you should probably learn to remember is that no one is thinking that you are weird, or even noticing the things that are making you anxious.  It's all in your head for the most part.  Something I have learned along the way is that a lot of what we are anxious about it self made and mostly mental.  Just try to stop over analyzing and criticizing yourself because EVERYONE has issues and insecurities.  Everyone handles it different.  To this day I'll get sweaty if I get nervous or anxious, but I notice it goes away once I'm able to collect myself.  Before going to a doctor to get meds or anything like that I think you should try and help yourself first.  Something that I've learned really helps with dealing with anxiety is getting exercise.  Going for walks really helps me and you might want to look into yoga or meditation as another means to clear your mind.  If you like any sports then try getting active in some, this will also help conquer your anxiety of being around ppl especially if it's a physical sport.  Also, you might want to pick up the book "The Power of Now" or "A New Earth" by Eckhart Tolle.  I know this advice might sound really lame, like too new age/spirtual crap, but it can't hurt to try and it probably will help you gain some new perspective.  It's also things you can do by yourself so no one will know.<br>  <br>  But yea if the sweaty palms dont get better after trying some of these things then you should see a doc for advice and at least then you can tell them all the steps you have taken to deal with your anxiousness.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped a little.  Feel better :)
9tkoP4rXaa	Should be the same. There are many causes. <br>  One form is pneumothorax. Because the air enters the pleural cavity from outside (open-wound) or from inside (rupture of bronchus) cause the pressure inside the pleural to rise. (Intrapleural pressure should always be negative to keep the lung inflated) so, the lung collapsed. Most of them heals by themselves. <br>  another form is atelectasis, Acute form is mostly by ARDS, or IRDS. and chronic form is secondary to inflammations. <br>  As steroids is for decrease inflammations, so, unless the collapsed lung is caused by inflammation, no

There is no danger of over dose, unless the half of that 15mg is still over the recommended dose that your MD has prescribed. There should be no problem cause that medicine is immediate release unless its coated with enteric coating then that med should never be split. Enteric coating should only be absorbed in the intestines and not in the stomach thus the coating. <br>  Should be okay. <br>  Ps. If 15mg is your recommended dose, you shouldn't split the pill. :)|`|LOfZNNdfaa	I don't think your going to get any educated answers.  I'll tell you why.  For one the amount of people that take a 15mg Morphine Inmmediate time release pill are very small.  The odds are you wont find a person who does use this pill.  Even if you did the odds are against you once again, who would try to cut it in half?  And who would Know the effects.  If it was overdose they wouldn't be able to tell you because they are now dead.|`|cpxkROqMaa	No, don't split the pill you will not get enough medication.|`|LmdZWrEWaa	no its not ok 15 mg of morphine is a lot of medicine, yes it is a higher risk of overdose especially if you mix with other drugs. play it safe and dont do it|`|ZcfZx60aaa	yes you can cut it in half, as long as you are sure it is IMMEDIATE release and not EXTENDED release.<br>  Nothing will happen, you will just get half the dose (and because of this it will stay in your system for less time)<br>  <br>  Although, of course, if you weren't prescribed morphine, then you shouldn't take it. But, if you are and just don't want the full dose you should be fine.<br>  Hope you feel better soon!
liAsVzl5aa	lonestarlady06, Acai berries are a newly discovered berry from south america that has some healthy characteristics. The acai berry is really high in anti-oxidants and really helps people loose weight quickly. There are lots of health advantages to acai berries, but they must be frozen right after harvest to make sure they retain thier potency. One of the major brands of acai suppliments is acai berry supreme.

I was after losing around 30lbs which had been with me all my life. I did a lot of looking around on the internet because I had heard mixed reviews of it and it seems there is a lot of fake stuff out there so you need to be careful. I liked the idea that its a natural product too. I did a trial at <a href="http://linkbee.com/FV9H" rel="nofollow">http://linkbee.com/FV9H</a> which was good because I wasnt sure if I should buy it first. I did do some exercise too to go with it which you will still need to do. Nothing will ever work without some willpower so remember you got to get up and about and put your heart into losing the weight. The Acai Berry is going to help you but you do need the desire to lose the weight too.<br>  <br>  Try and let us know how you get on.|`|SE9FSpZoaa	I've tried the Bowtrol Colon Cleanser and it does wonders for me.

I thank the colon cleanser for that big time.|`|8iPRklxSaa	Hi lonestarlady06 I didnt have any problems with it at all and lost more or less 20lbs in a few weeks. I liked it because its natural which I think is important nowadays. If you not sure about trying it I would certainly give it a go. I guess you are a bit like and keep seeing the latest fad diet. It will work for anyone as long as you have the desire to lose weight. If you not sure which one to try have a look at the trials a <a href="http://linkbee.com/FV9H" rel="nofollow">http://linkbee.com/FV9H</a> or one of the other ones on the internet.

This worked for me though.<br>  <br>  Good luck !|`|VopFncPhaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you specifically.

UIF7OBuxaa	It takes at LEAST a few days for the balls to fall off of an animal, it would take longer for a man. If he doesn't feel comfortable he can easily let you know and the rubber band can easily be removed. Go ahead try it. Have fun!|`|dYO33Yikaa	It sounds really dangerous. Even cock-rings which are too tight can harm the penis if it is too tight... I'd suggest to speak to a doctor to see if it causes long-term effects on the penis...<br>  <br>  Any there is nothing to be ashamed about premature ejaculation. It can be fixed.

However, don't tie it too tight or for a long time.<br>  And don't do it regularly.  Do it once in a while and let your bf decide if wants to continue using it or not.

It makes you very very hot and sweaty. The purpose of niacin and water is to sweat the thc out of your body. Technically depending on when you have your drug test you may be fine. if you dont smoke that often it CAN come out of your system in 3 days. when i was younger ( i dont smoke any more because i have a son) and was on probation i would smoke once a week and 2 days before my drug test i would take 2 capfulls of vinegar and drink 2 gallons of water in those 2 days and it always worked for me. I've had people that say it doesnt worked but i swear to you it worked for me. i never once failed a pee test on probation.

TsjqzanQaa	A tight foreskin usually can be relieved by stretching.<br>  <br>  The stretching needs to be done gently and gradually, trying to force it and use stretch with too much force can damage the penis and cause scarring.<br>  <br>  When erect, pull back on the foreskin until it is uncomfortable, but not painful.     <br>  <br>  When flaccid, put both index fingers into the foreskin opening, pull gently to widen the foreskin opening at its tightest point.    But again, do not use too much force, only to the point of mild discomfort, not pain.<br>  <br>  This takes several months to accomplish, doing it at least twice per day, for about 10-15 minutes at a time.<br>  <br>  Your glans will be somewhat hypersensitive, but this will diminish in time with short exposures to the air and gentle handling.<br>  <br>  It won't affect penile size, one way or the other.<br>  <br>  You're lucky to have a foreskin, which is a normal part of a complete penis, and essential for the complete sexual sensitivty and enjoyment in adult life.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|4arnbpUCaa	It doesn't affect penis size.<br>  <br>  You need to do some stretching exercises, ideally in the bath/shower, every day for a few weeks.

Exercise every day.|`|fme5kHAsaa	very hard to do when someone else makes food purchasing choices for you.  Losing weight is about calories.  Your body needs calories to function.  The extra calories eaten are stored as fat.  The extra calories needed are taken from fat.  period...no magical science here.   So...you should talk to you mom.  Ask her to purchase the lesser calories items.  For instance if a slice of bread is 110 calories but another brand is 80, purchase the 80.  Doing this will several everyday items will reduce your calorie intake without changing your diet.   READ THE LABELS.  You must burn more calories than you consume to loose weight.  If food can't be adjusted then your only option is to burn the calories off.   Walk, walk, walk.  Everywhere.  And remember veggies have almost no calories and fruits very few.  good choices always <br>  <br>  Good Luck... but don't worry too much.  You are young and you will be able to make all of your own choice in the future.|`|MWrwnHM2aa	Exercising to lose weight is the best way to go. If you are one of those who are averse to this idea, here are some reasons why you should consider exercising as the best way to go in terms of losing weight:<br>  <br>  1. Fewer Calories? You Can Only Go So Far: One part of the principle of losing weight is reducing the intake of calories that your body usually has in a day.<br>  <br>  However, you can only minimize your calorie intake to so much because your body will still need nourishment in order to keep running at an optimum level. This is where exercising to lose weight comes in. What it does is it helps you burn off the other calories that you have taken through your regular and controlled meals. Trust me; you don't want to be dizzy all the time just to keep your diet going.<br>  <br>  2. Exercising Has a Ton of Benefits: Yep, exercising to lose weight isn't the only thing to happen; it also helps keep your entire body in tip- top shape! It helps train your heart in order for it to pump more blood to your body. If your blood circulates well, then all your other organs will function better than before. Not only that, your bones benefit from the exercising as well! Exercising to lose weight might as well be the fountain of youth!<br>  <br>  3. Exercising Has Social Benefits, Too: You will not be the only one exercising to lose weight. There are a lot more people out there who firmly believe, have achieved and are continuing to achieve the benefits of exercising to lose weight! Having the same goal is a great reason to meet new people; you can help each other by pushing and reminding yourselves of your goals.|`|HIkXnqfzaa	walk/jog 1 mile every day for a month<br>  then step it up to do it faster every week from there on until you can do a mile in 7 minutes.<br>  <br>  then do a mile and a half<br>  <br>  then two miles in say 15 Min's<br>  <br>  then you will be pretty fit and the weight will come off<br>  <br>  tell your mum your are getting fit and ask for pasta, rice, chicken, fish, fruit, vegetables etc<br>  <br>  <br>  cut down on potatoes and bread and eat brown bread if you do<br>  <br>  good luck|`|YxynqOvtaa	drink a lot of water, eat smaller portions, don't eat between meals, and take up some sort of physical activity.

sXSk6jIEaa	Re-excision lumpectomy, or simply re-excision, means surgically re-opening the lumpectomy site to try to remove a larger margin of cancer-free tissue. When cancer cells are found close to the edge of the lumpectomy site, re-excision is necessary to ensure that all the cancer is gone. <br>  <br>  It's basically ensuring there is not even a slight chance for re-occurrence by removing any possible "cancer tainted" tissue.

A good place to look maybe online e.g yahoo groups.That may help her to open up and trust people more but it will take some time for her to realise this due to her background.

Eat a healthy well balanced diet (including your 5 a day fruit and vegetables), reduce saturated fat in your diet and try and make sure you do not consume more than 6g of salt per day.

As research information piled up, another fact became clear. Of the 200 people studied, a substantial number had a family history of heart attacks or strokes. That is, members of their families were particularly susceptible to these two diseases. The patients seemed to be unfortunate links in a heredity chain. Later, it was discovered that in some cases an excess of cholesterol in the blood was an inborn error of fat metabolism. Inability of some people to handle fat in their systems made them especially prone to atherosclerosis.<br>  <br>  When this atherosclerotic coat of arms has been handed down in a family, it is vitally necessary that double precautions be followed in strict adherence to a nutritional low-fat program, avoid smoking and exercise regularly.
iPsFTNivaa	If your mom has foam-like makeup pads, cut a small piece off of that and put it over the brackets that are bothering the sore.  You could also go to CVS, Walgreens, Wal-Mart or a similar store and buy some dental wax.  For nighttime relief,  you could try to wear a sports mouthguard.  These ideas will give you some temporary relief until you can get to the orthodontist.  I would recommend you use warm salt water rinses a few times a day, and keep your teeth/braces really clean, so your sore will heal more quickly.|`|eMW9a5JBaa	buy something over the counter to numb the area. you might also find something you can use as a  temporary to cover the brackets is like a dough temporary filling. but get the wax from your doctor.|`|fme5kHAsaa	get otc...zilactin.

But, if there is any chance you could be pregnant wait a week and take a test!|`|AA10363258	no that wouldn't make your period late!!|`|0sI33S9Kaa	i dont know I am a boy <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  LOL!!!!

1PLFUli0aa	I am type 1 diabetic and I cook normal meals for my husband and I, but just keep down on the carb intake (potatoes/breads/pastas). Baked Chicken is a favorite of mine and doesn't effect my blood sugar. I like to cook baked chicken breasts, green beans, and you can have rolls if you want (your husband does need carbs to keep his sugar regulated, just don't over do it). Any type of meat or veggie doesn't cause a sugar spike. <br>  <br>  for snacks, I'm a cracker girl! I like cheese crackers or peanut butter crackers. I get the 6 packs from walmart in the packages, that way you don't end up eating too many! Also I love FUZE drinks, crystal lite, or Diet Coke to drink because they won't effect blood sugar.  <br>  <br>  I also suggest drinking milk for low blood sugars! I have had diabetes for 15 years (diagnosed at 8 years old) and I have drank milk anytime I have low blood sugar and it always does the trick (of course if it is really low, add a half sandwich or something with it) Orange or Apple juice can spike the sugar and cause highs an hour or so after the low blood sugar. <br>  <br>  regulation is the key and your husband can still eat what he likes, just in moderation! Good luck to the both of you!|`|shMPNjRmaa	<a href="http://www.diabetic-recipes.com/recipes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.diabetic-recipes.com/recipes....</a>
T9m0YQgFaa	when you ovulate will depend on how long your cycles usually are.<br>  most women ovulate about 12-16 days before their period starts.<br>  however women can ovulate anywhere from 9-20 days before their period starts.<br>  remember that sperm can live inside you for upto 7 days.|`|H6ga6hrlaa	theres always a chance of conception no matter what time of your cycle.  however as you probably know most women ovulate two weeks after their period and because he didnt ejaculate inside of you there is a very slim to none chance of you actually being pregnant.
NtGgcLqbaa	i think its a rip off|`|6Wqvntx8aa	Im not familiar with shape'n'tone but ab belts definatly do work, I noticed mine after about 4 weeks of using one that i was getting more defined muscles. They recommeded 6-8 weeks before you notice results.<br>  <br>  They are medically proven, so you shouldnt worry about if they work or not, they definatly do - however, the problem with the ab area is that if you have too much excess fat that, it will only tone the muscles underneath.<br>  <br>  For best results, eat healthy, exercise AND use an ab belt - dont think it will be a miracle belt that will do it all for you.<br>  <br>  I would however recommened a slendertone ab belt over any other, they are by far the best in my opinion.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.toning-belts.com/2008/11/slendertone-system/" rel="nofollow">http://www.toning-belts.com/2008/11/slen...</a>

First, buy witchhazel at Walmart (I'm not kidding). Every night clean your face with the liquid on a cotton ball. Try to get as much sun as possible to your face, the sun kills acne. Cleaning your face too much causes acne, just so you know! Good luck!|`|1e6He4D9aa	okay, so, for every skin type its different, and something that worked with others doesnt mean will work for you. but you cant use only water. use something to wash your face, soap or washing gel perhaps but based on water and/or glycerin. dont put oily creams on your face, and wash it 2 times a day. and the best advice is to go see dermatologist, he will give you this pills for acne, and they have worked with ALL of my friends. :)
arsAqGf7aa	I never worry about it.  My boyfriend had been working outside all day one day last August and wanted to play, but I made him take a shower first because he stunk so bad.

xETCO0rUaa	I feel the same way sometimes! Depression runs really bad in my family so the slightest things sends me waaay down. Do something you enjoy, text friends, hang out at the mall ect. <br>  <br>  Try to find your vent, that might be a diary, a friend, or doing something new like dance lessons. Try to find the good things, like if a guy doesn't text you back you probably think omg he hates me and thinks im a stalker. Stop thinking that and think ok so he doesn't like me this happens for a reason now i can move on. Or when a friend bails on you cause they're busy, instead of thinking i have no life and i'm a loner, think i can spend time with my family and get ahead on homework so i can go out with friends tomorrow. <br>  <br>  Also exercising, and crying lets out this hormone ( i read this in a mangzine ) that makes you feel relieved. Also do things that make you feel acomplished, like finishing all your homework. If you need someone to vent to email me, i understand that sometimes all you need is a shoulder to cry on:):) Good luck:):)|`|upx2bF4Waa	If you feel depress, instead of sad movies watch comedy movies and don't listen to sad songs.

Do something to relax your muscles. Bake some warm, chewy, chocolatey brownies. Do anything. It always helps. And the best thing to do is spend time with the people you DO love. Listen to music. Lay down. Anything.|`|e72ee774f8daf9ca729e809880c5d0f6aa	First, it sounds like your environment is the sourceof your anxiety. Start by changing the environment - move out/move away. Second, exercise a) takes the mind away from the problems b) release hormones and chemicals that have positive effects on the mind. Finally, the "soul". Focus on something other than yourself! Then do something about it. Many, many more people with greater reasons to be unhappy. Watch "Slumdog millionaire". You can make a difference. Need ideas? Read Bill Clintons "Giving". Good luck - we all need a bit of that too. God Bless and Kind Regards.

q0ce9dEnaa	The veins are most likely normal, as that part of your penis has not been in much light/ in the environment, so don't worry about that. However, your foreskin problem sounds like it needs something done; it may need to be removed. The white stuff is probably just from not cleaning in there, which is very important for uncircumcised men.|`|AA10350894	Just keep trying to roll it back, do it in the shower (daily) and maybe even for a few minutes when you go to bed. Eventually you'll be able to do it. I can't say how long it will take because much depends upon how often you try to do it and how tight it may be.<br>  The white substance you found under your foreskin is Smegma, wash it off and continue to keep your penis as clean as possible. Over time it will disappear and if you keep your penis clean it should not return.<br>  Seeing veins around the surface of your penis is normal and nothing to worry about.|`|Un511PNWaa	dude it's normal i'm 14 and i have the exact same thing you don't need to worry about it, it's a good thing that we both aren't circumcised and you do need to clean the white stuff too it's noraml but it should be cleaned, don't remove the foreskin it's there for a reason|`|OiV3TkLqaa	You need to pull the skin back. Do it when it is not erect. If you have a normal uncircumcised penis you can do it. I did. It was a little tight but after you do it for a while, the skin will stretch. You need to wash off the white stuff. It's not clean and could give a problem later if you don't do it.|`|xk0WeWzaaa	I can't answer  the first, but i will the other two.<br>  <br>  The white stuff may just be residual from dirt and what not... just clean it off.

Some women don't handle this extra hormone very well, and experience mood swings, anxiety, depression. If this mood is unusual for you, and is new since you've been on hormonal contraception (the Pill or Depo-Provera), then this may not be a good choice for contraception for you. <br>  <br>  Also - is it possible that you're pregnant? Some women report out-of-control mood swings very early in pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Any time life changes,it introduces a certain amount of stress to your life, and your body often will react to positive and negative stress in the same way.

P3WfJeDjaa	at your age all you should be doing is eating healthy foods and exercising.  Don't go on a diet and don't make the mistake of setting weight loss goals.  Your goal should be to cut down on fatty, sugary over processed foods and to spend more time doing something physical.  That's it.  If you do that the weight will drop naturally and you'll be on your way to a healthy life.

Their may be normal reasons for that. Maybe you hit puberty before them? <br>  <br>  Explain you think you eat too much junk food and you need some advice on how to make it better. Don't just stop eating food or start calculating your calories. Most people do not do that stuff. Seriously. You would see professional athletes doing that, but they have a personally trainer assisting them with that stuff.|`|45qyvYU2aa	You're not going to lose 20 lbs in a month unless you cut off a leg.  Quit worrying about your weight and DO NOT start a diet at age 12 without consulting your pediatrician.  I've seen this too many times and it almost always leads to an eating disorder when girls start this early.

0BR3V98vaa	i think your trying to ask"what causes bad temper".<br>  and it mostly stress. your dad is just stressed out and angry. idk why... sometimes its just like that. i dont know how you can calm your father down if theres even a way to calm him down so he wont have a bad temper..... maybe you can try making him fall down a tree again|`|qmFpYwppaa	Let me see if I can translate.  <br>  <br>  Question - What CAUSES bad temper?  Ok.  When my dad was 22 he got MARRIED.  He is a nice guy with a good TEMPERAMENT.  One time he fell OUT OF a tree and WAS unconscious.  After that day his temper became very bad.  He STARTED saying bad things.  DOES falling OUT OF A tree GIVE bad TEMPER.<br>  <br>  Did I translate correctly?  If so, then your answer would probably be that your dad is suffering from a chemical imbalance caused by the fall.  Some people with severe head injuries can exhibit behaviors that they didn't before the accident.  He should go to a neurologist to rule out any other issues with his brain.|`|upx2bF4Waa	Most of the reason is because of the problem that they have.. I suggest you to ask your dad if he wants to learn how to meditate.|`|yiyvlbKLaa	he probably went crancy because of what happen to him.<br>  <br>  he might think. ok," why does this have to happen to me?"<br>  and he turns to a different person<br>  <br>  sorta like people that do drugs and smoke|`|45qyvYU2aa	Can we get a translator in here?

rwBh07Ncaa	1) even though looks are very important for guys, please, PLEASE don't be another girl that dates idiots that aren't interested in your personality. Only a relationship based on friendship, shared interests, and good communication will last. <br>  <br>  2) There is nothing more attractive to guys than confidence. Even though you might hear guys talking about boobs alot, I have seen guys drool over girls just because of their personality and confidence.<br>  <br>  3) You have got to own your body! The problem isn't your boobs. The problem is your attitude. You need to own your body because it's the only one you've got. Be proud of yourself. Dress to accentuate your body type, be confident, and above all STOP COMPARING YOURSELF WITH OTHER GIRLS!!! That is the kiss of death for women. It does you no good and it does guys who may like you no good.|`|UquxJBwVaa	if a guy really likes you he wont care how big or small your chest is. <br>  but if he does then hes obvisouly not the right guy for you.|`|1cfc52e63a94ccc90527b7620a90fc23aa	i wish i had small boobs i have 40 d boobs. do u want to trade.|`|4xN3ZIhYaa	if a guy is having sex with you only for your body is he worth having sex with?|`|UKKMPJjlaa	Chances are if you're having sex with someone, they already know your general boob size and won't care!<br>  Especially if you're in the heat of a moment.<br>  <br>  Boob size doesn't come as a surprise to anyone, it's the guys that have to worry about their...size when it comes to sex, 'cause no one knows what to expect!<br>  <br>  Just try not to get overly-padded-super-push-up bras because this can lead to be almost a let-down to guys once they do see your chest! or..if you're in a bathin suit or something to the like.

But its not like the guy that is about to have sex with you is going to be like "eww she has small boobs, now Im turned off"... I really dont think guys care about boob size as much as we all think they do.  I mean sure big boobs would be nice for some guys, but its not going to be a deal breaker.<br>  If you are really that self concious though you can always go get implants.  <br>  Good luck with everything =]|`|GhrRQ4Xcaa	its ok! if that guy dont like you then he isnt the one! a good guy would love you for you and more than just your looks! :O)|`|4eIXUy4paa	Big boobs aren't a requirement, at least in my opinion.  They are a plus but I wouldn't refuse a girl just because she has small boobs.  Besides, when you get that far with a guy, I'm sure he already has a pretty good idea that you don't have big boobs.  So you really don't have anything to be afraid of.<br>  <br>  Don't wear things like water bras though.  If you don't have it, don't try to flaunt it.  Flaunt something else.|`|sBQU4TEyaa	I like every girls....ill **** you....Really Hard.......and **** in your *****.......|`|oOU6XJOqaa	Boobs don't matter that much. try to develop nice legs, that will take the attention off of your breasts.|`|iAXF8PhNaa	um if u have nice curves or hips, *** watever than doesnt matter <br>  cuz lower body is the first|`|zlIrcv2Taa	this might sound corny, but it's totally true: your boobs don't define you--sexually or otherwise. if a guy doesn't like you as you are, why would you want to date him? if you believe in finding "that guy" then he wouldn't care.. and if you don't..there are plenty of guys who would love you for who you are. plus, there are other ways guys can find pleasure with your body. and don't think all guys like big boobs..that's just what's generally publicized..some guys don't|`|lLaN8cy4aa	Really, it isn't that big of a deal.

When you were a "junior teen" you could think it meant you are not mature yet (and I understand the confusion there can be) But in your twenties, you are as mature as can be, so you know that's not the case.<br>  <br>  So - well how to jump the hurdle... wanna cheat a little? Start by pretending you are fine with it. Soon you want to really be ;o)|`|MWrwnHM2aa	You need more confidence hunnie!<br>  <br>  1. Choose tops that enhance your breasts.<br>  Blouses: A pretty fitted blouse with a narrow v-neck will accentuate your bust. Ruffles, lace, breast pockets, and wide lapels will also give the illusion of having larger breasts. Stay away from blouses that are too big or flowing.<br>  <br>  2. Cross Your Bra Straps. In the back of your bra (behind, where it clasps) unhook the two straps and switch the little loophole they're fastened in. This will pull up your breasts, and make them look larger!<br>  <br>  3. Get a push-up or padded bra. Push-up bras push your cleavage together to enhance your breasts, and padded bras add heft to your breasts. Some bras have both these features. Gel bras, air bras, and water bras work in the same way, but they may move better with your breasts to appear more natural, and you may find them more comfortable.<br>  <br>  4. Eat more, but exercise. During a growth spurt, even if you do get physical activity, extra fat will go into your breasts.<br>  <br>  Good luck hunnie!!|`|KGrMMAOaaa	ugh i have big boobs. im 16 and a D. im trying to make them smaller haha you always want what you cant have i guess. just think, clothes fit you better bc their all made for small boobs now, and if the guy is sleeping with you he obv doesnt care lol and if he does then he's shallow.|`|gX7KThhoaa	guys will still notics you|`|JZMfUDylaa	sorry about that well you can try to get birth control pills. my friends and I all went up a cup size the 1st year when we were on it but if you want to get birth control make sure it has estrogen in it. If that's not enough then take hormone pills.|`|Rj7L1Rc6aa	they are a little small. but the man your with should be able to look past that|`|HryOaixWaa	okay get a boob job.....SUPRISE!!!!|`|BOuPi3wDaa	Well, being a 32 with any cup size means you're very skinny.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, depending on how tall you are.  But boobs are mostly made of fatty tissue and milk ducts, so without extra body fat boobs will not develop.  I was a 32A for a long time before I realized I could afford to gain a few pounds.  So I started eating more and eventually I began filling out.  I don't think you need to worry about gaining stomach or leg fat or anything because typically fat will be stored in your boobs before some place else, it's your body's way of preparing for a baby.  Keep in mind, though, that some people, like my mother, never really develop that much in the way of boobs.  She never got any bigger than a 34B.<br>  <br>  And any guy who doesn't like you because of something you don't have a lot of control over is pretty shallow.<br>  You should not feel bad because of the body type you have.  Everyone is different!|`|0BrVE2nvaa	It's odd because I've literally just answered practically the same question about five minutes ago.<br>  <br>  I can only speak from my personal point of view, but boob size isn't particularly important to me.  Plus, from a purely physical standpoint, different sizes tend to suit different frames; girls with slighter frames and large breasts tend to look too "top-heavy".  Likewise larger girls tend to be more naturally suited to bigger boobs.<br>  <br>  My personal opinion is that, again from a purely physical standpoint, boob size isn't nearly as important as a pretty face, even when it comes to sex.  When I'm making love I don't tend to spend all my time staring into my partner's chest (although sometimes it's difficult not to, depending on the position).  Anyway, once more from a physical point-of-view, if you are having sex the likelihood is that your partner will like your body regardless.  Either that or he's emotionally mature enough to realise that the physical desire that people feel for each other is nothing when compared to emotional desire.|`|nGwbqpQCaa	ok, if you're comfortable with your body, trust me guys will like. Guys won't like if you're not confident.|`|d11198287fd025ed5755e805b28b06adaa	Believe in yourself.
