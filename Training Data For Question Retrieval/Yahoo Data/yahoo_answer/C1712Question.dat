I've heard reports of 15 cm falling Tuesday night (or something like that), but that doesn't seem like very much to me (I'm Canadian, so I'm used to heavy snowfalls).  Does anyone know how much has fallen?  Looking at pictures it really doesn't seem like much, it seems like they're making a big deal out of a little snow.  How much more snow is this than what the UK usually gets?

Okay I just heard on top of everything that she wasted money getting plastic surgery when she can't even afford to pay for housing for her children and that she was looking at million dollar houses.  Okay so she wants the tax payers to pay for her to have a rich lifestyle?  She is asking for donations on her website to pay for her irresponsibility?  She is probably the the type that will put her kids in rags and buy designer clothes for for herself.  Not to mention having 8 kids she knew would be sick and have a low quality of life because of their physical and mental disabilities.        Yet there are people sticking up for her telling others to leave her alone.  Would you like someone taking your tax dollars to buy a mansion?

20090219193548AA6HvgH	News & Events;Current Events	Should the US Invade Pakistan?	The Pakistanis aren't doing jack **** to fight the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, they claim they are but everyone knows it is a joke. The Pakistani government just placed Islamic law over a northern province as part of a ceasefire agreement with the Taliban... let me emphasis this, A CEASEFIRE WITH THE TALIBAN!!!!! they are now a state that harbors terrorists and even worse, has nuclear weapons.      I think that we should take out their nuclear weapon, because we know where they all are, and treat them like we did Afghanistan when we first invaded. that would be a major blow to the Taliban, possibly end the major war faster, and most importantly let every country know that the US does not sit lightly on countries that harbor or give in to terrorists.      Obama's idea of bombing Pakistan (at the beginning of the presidential race) was inappropriate at the time, but now it could fly... I would go with is at least      So what are other people's thoughts on this? agree or disagree and why.

I've been watching Nancy Grace lately, and of course the latest topics includes the abduction of the little girl in Florida and the Caylee Anthony case.  I'm watching it right now, and she has 3 lawyers on the show and asking a question about the "Tot Mom" being videotaped after hearing her daughter was found,,,,not going into details about the show, but Nancy Grace is asking these lawyers questions and anything the lawyers say, she's constantly interrupting them, and constantly is not listening to them   WHY THE F&#*(* have them on the show if anything they say, she doesn't believe them, interrupts them all the time, and is already saying the "TOT MOM" is guilty.        Why even have a show on and have guests on the show, if she's already going to not believe anybody      The show (most of the time) is pretty good, but she gets on my last nerve when she has guests on, and they're all wrong, and she's always right.  Why ask questions if you're not going to believe anything they say?      I know, I know, I can change the channel, and I do.  But for the long time Nancy Grace fans, has she always been like this?  because she makes me sick watching her a times

20090219190832AAhxMFC	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Did you hear about Al Sharpton and the Comic from the NY Post?	judge for urself, was it meant to be racist? [if ur going to look at the comic, at least read the paragraph i posted from an article.. then tell me what u think about the comic       http://www.tmz.com/2009/02/18/al-sharpto...       Chimpanzee attack comic; is bringing out the race card really necessary here?      The Rev. Al Sharpton is very upset over a comic that appeared in today edition of the New York Post. The comic is of two cops shooting a chimpanzee. The comic by Sean Delonas says: "Now they will have to find someone else to write the stimulus bill." I see this as referring to the recent shooting of that chimpanzee that attacked a woman. It is inferring, at worst, that the politicians signing the stimulus bill are like chimpanzees. It seems Al Sharpton is pulling the race card on this one. TMZ reported that Rev. Al Sharpton said, "The cartoon in today's New York Post is troubling at best given the historic racist attacks of African-Americans as being synonymous with monkeys."

I notice that there are many paragraphs that are very violent such as:    Sura (4:74)   Sura (8:39)       Sura (47:4) - "So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then smite the necks until when you have overcome them, then make (them) prisoners,"

20090203103801AAPM0jf	News & Events;Current Events	Why dont they export the Palestinians into Iraq and settle them their?	"Who,after all, still todays speaks of the annihilation of the Armenians" - Adolf Hitler on the eve of WW2    Sooner or later Israel will somehow have to contend with its "Armenians", the Palestinians with a permanent solution instead of a little violent blip here and their and then recoiling when the world pours scorn on them for using too much force.    Population trends have shown that the Israeli Arabs will win in about 100 years with bigger families and swamp Israel and make up about 75% of the population of Israel    So why doesn't Israel in league with its ally America come up with a plan to deport all the Palestinians from Gaza and the West bank to Iraq as part of a permanent solution to the "Palestinians problem"?    Why dont they start building train tracks from Gaza city to Baghdad, with Saudi oil money?    I mean who dare will stop Israel from doing this militarily it is the SECOND MOST POWERFUL army on the earth?    After all in 1915 the US/UK and much of the world did make a lot of noise with what the Ottoman Turks were doing, a bit the protester are doing now with Israels war over Gaza. But in reality that's all they could do just make a lot of noise and burn flags.    Also in reference to Hitler quote no one saved the Armenians, that's why Hitler continued with the Holocaust, even in post WW2 nations like Bosnian Serbs, Rwandans, Cambodians have done it, so whats to stop with Israel getting its hands a bit dirty and sort out its problem out once and for all?

20090203104505AAXweZl	News & Events;Current Events	Do you think this is a fitting tribute to the film Star Wars?	London, Feb 3 (ANI): Computer wizards have found a unique way of paying tribute to Star Wars film. In a competition on photo editing website Worth1000, they have put the cast of the hit film in some of the world's classic artworks, reports the Sun.      Winged Jedi master Yoda has replaced Cupid in Bouguereau's 1888 composition L'amour Au Papillon. Astromech droid R2D2 has taken the place of the little girl sitting on the chair-in need of some WD40-in artist's La Petite Boudeuse, or The Little Sulk.      Most of the cast - including Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford's Han Solo and Alec Guinness's Obi-Wan Kenobi - and director George Lucas, appear in Philippe de Champaigne's 17th Century Last Supper.      Michelangelo's Creation of Adam, which appears on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, now involves a lightsaber clash between Adam and Darth Vader - replacing God from the 1511 original. Star Wars baddie Darth Vader is seen knighting a stormtrooper in the English historical painter Edmund Blair Leighton's 1901 work The Accolade.   Another stormtrooper makes an appearance in Leonardo da Vinci's classic 1487 drawing Vitruvian Man. Vader also appears as Venetian artist Titian's Duke Of Alba in the 1536 painting of the same name.

20090203103647AAuqbEz	News & Events;Current Events	Does anyone have a terracotta vase being used as a garden ornament?	Methinks you should check how old it is...      London, Feb 03 (ANI): A terracotta vase used as a garden ornament turned out to be an ancient Egyptian relic dating back almost 3,000 years. The owner inherited the 13-inch high stone jar about 20 years ago from an uncle and kept it in her front garden in north Dorset, not realising its importance.      The canopic jar, complete with cover, was originally designed to hold the internal organs of the dead as part of the mummification process.Experts discovered that the lid of the ornament was modelled on the face of the Egyptian god Imseti, wearing a black striped wig. The jar was designed to hold the liver and Imseti would have protected the organ for use in the afterlife, according to ancient tradition.      The owner took it to be valued and was surprised to find out the piece, with its distinctive pharaoh headdress, dates to between 1550-1069 BC."It came from an uncle who was a bit of a collector and when he died about 20 years ago it came to us," the Telegraph quoted the owner of the ancient jar, who does not want to be named, as saying. "We didn't know what it was and we have kept it on the patio and in the shed over the years. It was just used as a decorative piece, a lump of stone.      "Then I looked at it and saw it had a face and it looked a bit Egyptian so we took it in to be valued and was told it was from ancient Egypt."It was a great surprise that something that had been sitting there for some time unrecognised turned out to be so old," the owner added. The ancient jar is damaged and so is not expected to sell for more than 1,000 pounds when it goes on sale at the auction house Duke's in Dorchester on February 5.      However, Amy Brenan from Duke's said: "It is very rare to have something such as this brought to us. "The owner had had it in his garden for about 20 years without realising what it was. It is incredible to think how old it is and what was happening in the world when this was made.(ANI)

Last Monday My Papa ( grandfather) passed away of pneumonia. He was 3 months shy from his 87th birthday.      I can't express how devastated I am because both my Nana (-my grandmother who is still alive at 91) and Papa practically raised me along with my parents.      Last week I was given the honor to write his obituary for the paper and my Aunt (a teacher for 15 years) proofread it for errors to be submitted.      She then asked me to write a "Thank you" letter to the hospital (JFK) ,including the ICU dept for all of their efforts.      It took a whole day just to write the obituary. I really put thought into what I wrote but now, I am just drawing blanks. I feel that because the service is in a few days (Friday), it is getting harder to write this letter.      I am truly at a lost of words (even now) and I was hoping someone out there will be able to help me think of a few nice things to say.      You can include personal or professional experience if you wish. Any help would be appreciated. ~ I don't want to let my family down.      Thanks everybody =)
