20090219170112AAjOLK0	Beauty & Style;Makeup	I want to make my makeup look a lot better and cleaner, especailly my face makeup but i have acne?	Ok so i really want to make my makeup look fresh and new all the time. I have to use cover up though because i have acne scars. I only use clinique cover up because it works best and doesnt make me break out. I also use a light mineral powder over it, and a light blush. My makeup seems to fade or it looks really discolored. I also want to make my cheeks look thinner but i dont know how. I also want to maybe change around my eye makeup. I have bright blue eyes, and i wear eye liner on my top and bottom, and mascara on my top and bottom. I really want to make my makeup look cleaner!! please help! thank you!!

I've got pale skin and green eyes, and about half my family's redhead german and scottish anyways. If that won't work.....I'd really like to keep it red. Just my dad will kill me if I keep it this bright (it seriously looks like a strawberry jell-o box). Thanks!!

20090203113119AA5gplS	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Just wanted to inform you guys!?	So, as many of you know I have extremely dry skin. This wouldn't really be a problem, but sadly, my skin doesn't peel on its own. So the dry layers just accumulate, till my skin gets thicker and thicker...and more uneven. I rarely get spots, but I have extremely uneven skin.      Before last summer I started the chemical peels, but since I always go to Spain in the Summer (A LOT of sun) I chickened out about doing that over the summer, because when a lot of sun hits those "thinned out/peeled down" layers of skin, major scars can form.      Months later I started becoming really unhappy about my skin again and while the pill has regulated my hormones, which means my face isn't dry, dry, dry anymore...the dead skin still won't fall of properly (yes, even when I peel myself).      So, today I started up the chemical peels again. It hurts like a *****. The dermatologist applies a chemical solution to your skin for roughly 4 minutes. Those chemicals cause a chemical burn to the first layer of your skin. It sounds worse than it is, trust me. Through that "artificial sunburn" new cells are forced to go into production aka new healthier skin forms.      Now you need to have this prescribed and you have to do it over months!      So, I'm going to take a picture of my face, without make-up, right after the treatment) for the next few months and in the end I may have worked up enough courage to show you the before and after picture.      My main problem is that I scratch at my dry skin till it becomes bloody, but the peelings stop that too...since putting the solution on wounded skin hurts more than on unbroken sin.      So, stay tuned. I know how annoying my self-esteem issues are and this is probably really going to boost it!      Though I did walk around town with sunglasses, a scarf, and a hat on today, because after the first day of treatment I basically look like an irritated, but smooth, tomato.      Wish me luck!

However, my hair grows back before the next time I wax. So, I learned how to thread while I wait until the next waxing experiance. It was okay at first, but then I realized that the whole reason I started waxing was because eventually the unwanted hair would grow back thinner and slower and then no longer grow back. Will the threading interfer with the hair growing back more thicker and longer?

20090219185534AAGjBaL	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	I currently own a bracelet...?	and i don't know what it is called or where I can find another if it needs to be a replaced.  I am going to describe it and either need someone to help me figure out what the name of it is or where I can go to find out what it is called.  It is somewhat ovular (kind of like the shape of an eye) and is black with a floral (almost chinese floral) pattern on it.  The band is silver and it is a bracelet that latches... the band has a little indent in it and when it connects the indent of it rests against a small piece on the "eye" that holds it in place.  Additionally i bought it in Mexico, I don't know if that helps.  Many of my friends also say they have seen them before so im guessing that they are a populat bracelet.  If you know what it is called, where i can find it and have a website i can go to to order a new one you get 10 points!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE HELP!      -Claire

20090220170650AAFc52w	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	I have a high heels question?	I bought a pair of Jessica Simpson pumps. They are absolutely perfect except when I walk in them. Normally I wear a size 9, but I ordered these online and of course didn't get a chance to try them on first. I read every review that was posted on the site for these shoes and most people said they ran a little big in size. So, I ordered a size 8.5. They feel a little snug in the toes (pointy toe shoes) and that was expected, so I went out and got some nylon stockings to wear with them. However, when I walk the heel flops up and down on my heel almost as if they are still too big! I don't want to exchange them for a size 8 because I know that would be too small. Would getting thicker socks solve this? I already went out and got Dr. Scholls heel pads thinking that would make them fit better but it didn't.      These are the shoes:  http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...

20090220175849AAQKmDy	Beauty & Style;Hair	Quick question about my hair?	My hair is thin, frizzy, and wavy with some curls. I usually let it air dry because my blow dryer is broken, so I was wondering what my hair would look like if I did this.      1.) I have an angle in the front (kinda like really long side-swept bangs) and they especially get frizzy and poofy. If I put them back in a thick headband and let them dry that way, would they be straighter or less frizzy?      2.) What else can I do to make my hair AIR DRY straighter? Please no chemicals or heat. Or even a way without any products would be GREAT! :)      Thanks everyone! :)

20090220230712AAR7oZB	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Can someone help me dress preppy?	Alright, i am a 15-year-old black girl in the 10th grade. I live in Northern Virginia, and i want to establish this style.       In the past, i used to try and dress "black" because i am black, but all that got me was the wrong group of friends that i didn't fit in with. I now realize that what you wear can REALLY affect the way that you are treated. I am tired of some people assuming that just because i wear braids/cornrows that i hang out with bad people or that i am "ghetto". I don't even act in that stereotypical way, like loud, obnoxious, rude, unfriendly, and only hangs out with blacks. In fact, i hang out with people of ALL races, and I LOVE the diversity that i am able to have. Sure i listen to hip-hop and RnB, but i also listen to rock-alternative and sometimes country too. Anyway, I am tired of those black stereotypes being targeted at me. Believe it or not, i usually don't usually get along with "ghetto" people anyway. I try to be nice to the ones that i do meet, and usually they are just two-faced towards me or they look at me like i am a piece of trash, when in reality, i have a better attitude than them, and when i come around, people don't act like they are afraid of me, or like they are plotting some kind of revenge or something.      Anyway, i have seen this style on some black people at my school, and i liked it, because it makes a person look nice. I want to be that person. CAn someone please tell me where to shop at? If i asked this question out loud at school, i know that i would be harrased and made fun of because of it.      Please don't mean. I just want some informative answers. All good answers will get a free thumbs up from me, which is a free point on top of your two points for answering my question.

Unfortunatly, I do not have such a great eye for fashion as most others do. So, I'm just going to get straight to my request...   I would really appreciate it if someone could put together some outfits for me from sites online like Forever 21 or Urban Outfitters. It's true that I am capable of finding a nice pair of jeans or a good t-shirt on my own. But what I have trouble with is creating outfits.    So there is this really usefull website for creating outfits called www.polyvore.com . I would really appreciate it if someone could answer my question with links to outfits they've created. I only ask that the prices in the outfits are reasonable and that the outfit would be suitable for school. And if you need a style to work off of...try something  bold with color, but that also has a but of black. Like Lady Gaga/Hannah Beth/Bill Kaulitz.    Thanks guys, I really appreciate it :)

Basically my body type is athletic shoulders/arms/legs but my midsection has got minor problems. Lets just say there are some love handles and not the size 0 waistline. I watch What Not to Wear and you know how they are always showing people what to wear for their body type, basically I need help with that, especially since spring is right around the corner. I really appreciate anyone who take time out to help me out. Thank You!
20090220233637AA9JKxi	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Which is better, MAC or Barry M?	MAC eyeshadows may be more expensive (they're ￡12 i think) but the Barry M ones (￡4.50) are amazing and can be used wet. They both come in cute little pots and stuff and have a MASSIVE range of colours, but the Barry M ones tend too spill UNDER your eye which is VERY annoying. Which is better and reasons? thanks xx

20090221000301AAx50Cr	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Is being bow-legged unattractive to men? Is there any way to fix this?	I am a 16 year old girl and I'm bow legged and sort of pigeon toed (however, I'm getting better). Some people tell me (mostly girls though) that they think it's so unique to be bow legged, as it makes me different then most girls. Some say they even envy me for being different. My question is, do guys think being bow legged and/or pigeon toed is gross? I realize that guys have different preferences, but guys, what do you think?      Would you rather your girl have normal legs, or ones with "character" such as being bow legged? And when a girl is pigeon toed does it bother you? Or do you think it's cute?      Thanks in advance, I just want to hear your guys' opinions.      P.S. Is there anything that I can do to make me look less bow legged? Or is there any exercises that can help my legs become straighter. Your tips would be much appreciated.
