20090128132701AAZjCsW	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	When I get a txt message on my LG Voyager when on vibrate, the screen sometimes doesn't show?	I have it on vibrate most of the time, and when I get a text, it will usually make a couple of vibrations, and the screen with NEW TXT MESSAGE pops up. But sometimes it doesn't, sometimes, it would just vibrate (not in several vibrations) and the screen doesn't show up to say that I have a new text message. Why do you think this is? Do you think there is something wrong with the phone? or is it normal because it is a touchscreen phone.

20090128143854AAJUj4F	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Another Mobile Phone Question?	Hi, just another quick Q :)    On my contract phone it says I will get 600 mins a month.    So this obviously means I can phone people for 600 mins, but when someone else rings me and I accept their call does that just use up their minutes and not mine too?      So an example would be boyfriend and girlfriend, both have 200 mins, he rings her for 30 mins one night and she rings him for 30 mins the next night - making their minutes "last longer" - if you get my drift. Is this possible then, or does it deduct minutes from BOTH of you? Thanks x

20090128143728AAXuZG1	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Original Xbox - Coax hook up?	I am trying to hook up my original xbox.  I remember before I hooked it up to a tv with only coax.  When I unpacked my xbox it only had RCA.  I didn't run it through a vcr or anything, as best as I can figure out, since I had no vcr with an input jack.  Am I just missing the coax out wire?  Or did I hack this back then (entirely possible..).        The only way I can think of off hand that i would try would be to get a coax->the two wires adapter and then attach the audio/video to that.  I'm not sure this would even work, or at least work well.        How did I do this?!  Or what is another way to do this? For free.  I have a fair amount of electronics I can cut/tape/solder at hand

It has crashed even when I was only scrolling through music, but that happened only once. I don't believe that there is something wrong with my Flash0, but there could be.

I have 16 homebrew apps on my psp and 9 .ctf themes, but I didn't flash any of them in, I am using cxmb. I also put one program on my mem stick that crashed when I exit on my 1gb stick, and it exited fine, but not on my 4gb. Anyone have any ideas what's wrong?      By the way, I am using 5.00 M33-6 cfw with a 1.5 kernel add on.
