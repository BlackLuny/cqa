YudN38jFaa	When it comes to military balls our advice is keep it simple and classic - it's not really the occasion to be trying out the latest directional trends. Not that that means you can't look fantastic and so now. One of the hottest looks for spring is the one shoulder dress so we suggest that you snap one up - we would probably opt for full length. We've had a look around for you and some of our favourite finds are below - just add high heels and a smattering of statement jewellery for the perfect outfit. We'd also like to suggest that you check out Banana Republic - unfortunately they're not online so we can't post links but they do some great simply chic gowns that would be perfect:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.debenhams.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_10001_10001_66851_822748_-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.debenhams.com/webapp/wcs/stor...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.debenhams.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_10001_10001_66851_823873_-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.debenhams.com/webapp/wcs/stor...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.houseoffraser.co.uk/Principles+One+shoulder+dress/118957759,default,pd.html?cgid=0357&cm_mmc=Affiliate-_-Linkshare-_-Linkbuilder-_-Null" rel="nofollow">http://www.houseoffraser.co.uk/Principle...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.matchesfashion.com/fcp/product/Matches-Fashion/womens/yeojin-bae-yeo-v-yc7107-dresses/9263?colour=black&source=UK&siteid=40957" rel="nofollow">http://www.matchesfashion.com/fcp/produc...</a><br>  <br>  The ELLE team|`|hX1Qfs3qaa	I've actually been to a few Military Balls (my sister's in the military) and I've always worn a floor-length dress that's not too showy.

I did a hot oil with extra virgin olive oil within a two day period and the second time was when I noticed some nice results with my hair (curlier than normal, extra shine, silkier and smoother strands and over time stronger hair). I did this every time I washed my hair (1-3 times a week) for a few weeks and I did notice that the health of my hair improved.

V5lzVEXOaa	My acne started when I was in middle school, and kept progressing through my early twenties. I get pimples on my chin, my temples, and cheeks. I get blackheads on my nose, and the area surrounding it. I also have a lot of redness with it that makes it that much worse!<br>  <br>  At first I tried all of the drug store stuff--Neutrogena Acne Free Wash, Strydex pads...but all those did was make my face even worse. They burned like no other and I never got any better results.<br>  <br>  I then tried proactiv, which made my face so bad that I wanted to cry. The only product that worked for me is their Refining Mask, and I still use that to this day.<br>  <br>  I noticed that all of the cleansers had either Salicylic Acid or Benzoyl Peroxide, and my skin HATED them. So I avoided those products like the plague.<br>  <br>  For a while, I did nothing. I didn't wash my face, or use any products. I figured I would rather live with what my body gave me than use all of these products that made it much, much worse.<br>  <br>  I was browsing the net a few years ago looking for more solutions. I just knew there had to be something that could work for me. I stumbled upon the website acne.org, which gives lots of excellent advice on products,threads,  and it has a feature where users submit comments for products that they have tried.<br>  <br>  As I was reading one of the threads, someone was raving about a product called Aqua Glycolic. I had never heard of it, so I started doing some research. It is sold in the drugstores, but is kept behind the counter because of its high Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA) content. They make a face wash, toner, face cream as well as a body wash.<br>  All of the reviews that I found on it were so good, (from makeupalley, acne.org, drugstore.com) I just had to try it out for myself.<br>  <br>  It has done wonders for me! It has cleared up my acne, shrunk my pores, tightened up my face, and taken the redness out! I also had results after a week, not 4 or 6 or 8 or even 12 like some other products claim. It has changed my life! The only problem is that you have to make sure you either put on sunscreen or your makeup has sunscreen in it, because this makes your skin very sensitive to sunlight.<br>  <br>  Do a little research of your own and you might find it will work for you like it did for me :)|`|C7FxHBwBaa	Well, it's not a success story because I still have acne problems, but I started using a Tea Tree oil based cleanser and that at least reduced the acne by a lot! St. Ives made a good one called Clear Pore, but I think it got discontinued because I can't find it anywhere! Desert Essence makes another good one called Thoroughly Clean, a bit spendy, but worth it. Oh, and not to discourage anyone, but I'm 26 and I still am dealing with light acne. No scars though, thank goodness!|`|6758c821b132686ab57ec075ec135491aa	I know it's hard but just ignore it. Just wash your face regulary and that's it beleive me it would pass|`|mAcRtRUQaa	I use to have severe acne; it was absolutely disgusting. (I'm still only sixteen by the way.)<br>  <br>  I would desperately spend hundreds of dollars on multiple acne products, including: Proactiv, Clean&Clear, Clearasil, Neutrogena, Murad, Biore, etc. <br>  <br>  Proactiv worked for about six months. Then, suddenly stopped preventing my acne. Eventually the acne came back, even worse than before might I add. Clean&Clear did absolutely nothing but dry out my skin.  Clearasil, same result as C&C. Biore was too sensitive. <br>  <br>  Then, i finally discovered Neutrogena. I LOVE IT! :) <br>  I also use Murad's Refining Mask. I love that too:) <br>  <br>  My face is now silky smooth, as it has been for over 9 months! THANK THE LORD!!!! :)

l6yn08LNaa	I use spray on tans there so great! And they dont fry your skin like taning in the sun will do=)|`|ZaC5udNBaa	Tanning oil conducts sunlight.  Even with an SPF, I definitely wouldn't recommend using it if you're very pale.  <br>  <br>  I'm extremely pale and I never go to the beach with anything less than a sunscreen with an SPF of 15.  <br>  <br>  The best way to get a good tan is gradually.  If you're very pale and normally burn, you will never get a good tan in just one day.  Try going to a tanning salon and getting a good base tan.  Once you have a good base color, then use the oil so long as you keep reapplying. <br>  <br>  If you're really concerned about how you'll look over the weekend, spray tans  are wonderful!  They give you instant color and can last up to two weeks!

They also have different reading sections, like different hair extension methods, and news about extensions.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that Great Lengths, HairDreams, Remylinks, will be some of the best brands out there.  Choose on a licensed hairdresser.  Lot’s of jokers out there without licenses.  And make sure to see if the person has lots of before and after pictures.|`|aEpPt9koaa	Ew! Thats going to be a hard one.  I used to live in Iowa City.  Iowa is not the most fashion forward state, and not a lot of people wear weaves up there either.  Its going to be extremely hard to find extensions longer than 14" in that entire state.  You might be able to find something in Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, or the Quad Cities but I seriously doubt. Your best bet is to make a trip to Chicago if your trying to get long extensions.  You just have to decide if you want to invest the money and time just for getting extensions.   Try contacting some salons in the cities I mentioned and see what they say.|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	Not safe 2 tell people you dont know where you live
PwxmrBm9aa	Usually highlights are permanent, you can get thin ones though so you can easily get them 'cut out'. I would always reccommened going to a salon to get your hair done, if it goes wrong they will probably fix it for you for free.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Just enough to help volumize your hair and maybe face framing layers too? :)<br>  Don't grow it out very long cause that will make thin hair look too flat. <br>  But a little past shoulders with a few layers would be okay.<br>  But if you go to a professional hairstylist, they will know what would look best on you.
STY5pSAsaa	your wife has no self-confidence.|`|0iAGnjFvaa	to her; you think the blonde woman is more beautiful<br>  <br>  some women are very sensitive and because you think the blonde was pretty, your wife thinks she is not<br>  <br>  tell your wife how beautiful she is more often, and be careful when talking about other women<br>  <br>  i hate to admit im, im a lot like your wife, i will make drastic changes if i feel they'll make me look prettier, she's just insecure about it|`|1IVEYMA9aa	First I would never tell my wife, if i had one, that i saw a beautiful woman at work. Because it makes her feel as if she is second best. She probably feels as if you liked the dyed hair and she wants to make herself look beautiful in your eyes. Second, yeah talk to her. Tell her you love her.|`|ftcxybsLaa	She's jealous, and wants to meet your standards. Since you said you met a beautiful blonde woman, she's thinking that your idea of a beautiful woman is blonde. You should tell her that she's beautiful the way she was.|`|5Lw7feUkaa	Bless her, she must feel a little insecure... I guess I would too if my partner called another woman beautiful... probably would have done the same thing! Think she deserves some nice compliments.. maybe tell her she suited her hair the original colour- so it doesn't seem as if you prefer her now she's blonde too... if that makes sense!|`|aKCoaQpcaa	she just did that cause you made that comment. just tell her that you like it but tell her you absolutely loved the previous look she had. and who knows she just might dye it back cause she really wants your attention|`|YN0DdLVlaa	Perhaps she's insecure, she wants you to find her attractive. Could be a bit of jelousy in there too. Tell her you think she's beautiful and you love her the way she is.|`|z56kYp74aa	What was your motivation for telling your wife that?  That's what you should be wondering about.|`|auUeI2Vnaa	Maybe she felt you would be more attracted to her.

This says nothing of her character only that she loves to please you and you should thank her for being this way.|`|JbSebJJYaa	She probably thought you would think that she was more beautiful if she had blonde hair.

PwxmrBm9aa	Argh I get so angry at people putting comments like ummmm & i dunno. Sorry had to get that off my chest.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are a million answers to this question, I will try my very best to give you good info :) Are you using a shampoo with sulfate in it? If so then that would contribute to dry hair, you will achieve great hair if you spend good money on products. The best hair products are Aveda or MOP, they all contain natural ingredients I have also heard great things about those ranges. Are you just shampooing & conditioning? Things like putting coconut/avocado/olive oil in your hair before shampooing protects the protein in your hair, also after conditioning are you using a heat defence if you use heat? Or a nourishing spray with vitamins? Try and find a great leave in conditioner with natural ingredients, vitamins & protein. After all that use a few drops of oil and distribute through your hair concentrating mostly on the ends, this seals moisture into your hair. Our hair is porous - moisture can leave it as soon as you put it in!<br>  <br>  I have a hair blog that may give you some more tips - <a href="http://thelonghairdiaries.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://thelonghairdiaries.blogspot.com/</a>|`|OjXvYEZDaa	Washing hair every day is not good for hair it can make damage on hair|`|paerqxfMaa	Maybe your shampoo is too strong or not right for your kind of hair- do you use a conditioner after shampooing?|`|hdFSt0xNaa	Washing your hair everyday is absolutely terrible for your hair. <br>  (im doing a hair and makeup course).<br>  Wash it every 3days if it get greasy quickly like mine and use TRESemme hair protector, conditioner and shampoo.<br>  This should resolve your straw like problem <br>  Hope i've helped (: x0x.|`|xkSuKSn8aa	I wash mine everyday. <br>  I think your hair is telling you it likes being washed everyday.<br>  It depends on your shampoo and conditioner whether it is bad to do it everyday. Use a clear shampoo with a creamy conditioner.|`|FVWvN07xaa	ummmm|`|HVc8kBcvaa	Yeah washing your hair every day isn't the best thing you can do for your hair.  Try this instead: Day one-shampoo and condition. Day 2-only condition. If you can get away with a 3rd day then just condition on that day as well.  4th day shampoo and start over again.  If you use a lot of product like hairspray then you might need to shampoo every other day.  If you're using a heavy conditioner then it could make your hair heavy if you don't shampoo before.  But by just rinsing your hair with water and conditioning it on the days in between shampoos should have your hair feeling soft and shiny with less damage being done to it! Yay!<br>  <br>  also, shampoos with sodium laureth sulfate (not LAUREL) are the most gentlest shampoos.  Avoid any that contain ammonium laurel/laureth sulfate.  Sodium laurel sulfate is better than those but harsher than sodium laureth sulfate.  Tresseme has at least 2 that have only have s. laureth s. There are shampoos out there without sulfates but they are pricier.  I believe the person above me mentioned a few.|`|WRaaOjeiaa	Do you use heat products on ur hair?<br>  <br>  hair straighteners, blow dryers.   etc,etc.
L9kqt0LLaa	It's preferable, but not essential to have a 6 pack. <br>  <br>  and I think you'll find that most models do NOT 'go commando'. If they did, they would smell like a tramp!|`|M1PYqC3qaa	Haha ... I don't think all models go commando.<br>  It might be a bit uncomfortable ... and you could hardly go to an underwear shoot if you had chaffing! <br>   I think that yes, you should have 6 pack abs to become a model. And even if it's not an absolute must - then it certainly helps! You will get so much more work with ripped abs.
4dIWZCLGaa	I'm personally not a fan of home-dying, it never turns out right (I've dyed my hair myself lots of times and it didn't come out the way I thought it would).

MAC is very thick and heavy so it does tend to clog pores and break you out on the other extreme I also DO NOT recommend Bare Minerals this product line contains bismuth oxychloride which also creates lots of skin problems.<br>  <br>  The ebst product I have worked with that truly works is bee luscious cosmetics liquid to powder minerals that is hypo allergenic and will not break you out.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.beeluscious.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.beeluscious.com</a>|`|aZOhxQBzaa	i like their cosmetics. i heard that one of their liquid foundation breaks some people but i think their pressed powder is good : )|`|6yAmCUPeaa	foundation is the only MAC product that isnt good actually. chanel has the best.|`|nhLakq35aa	no.|`|BwtqjaNYaa	Ehhhh....although I should be a poster child for the line, I dont fancy there foundation. The concealer is FAB but there foundations, for me, come out with a gray effect. Try Bobbi Brown Makeup. I have not tried hers myself but I heard it does wonders. Warning....its a bit pricey.|`|fJc2F6MUaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you.

mJbwemH8aa	If u mean after yr grow up, like after ten or more years it will show only a dot and nothing gross, just make sure not to play with it when u remove it.<br>  <br>  .|`|VBlrL1puaa	It depends on a hoop or stud if its a stud yes but lip piercings close quickly so itd be close the next day.|`|sQqQT85Raa	If you want to get rid of your piercing, you can take the ring/labret out and it'll close up in a day. If you haven't had it for long, there will be a scar but you will hardly notice. However, if you've had it in for long you might get a pimple looking scar once it heals. It varies from person to person I guess. <br>  <br>  If you're talking about changing from a labret to a ring, trust me, you will notice the hole when you take out your labret. However, if you can't see it, sort of like scrunch your lips together to make it seem like you're kissing and look for the hole. It will be noticeable since there will be a dent. Sounds weird but it works.<br>  <br>  I hope I answered your question! Goodluck :]|`|4GUZV7fpaa	My friend had to take hers out for school and once it was out you could barely tell she had a piercing, i think we only noticed the hole because we knew it was there, otherwise i doubt we'd have noticed lol<br>  <br>  It will just look like you have a tiny spot :)|`|Ja7M7JKhaa	well if u have it in for a little bit and u take it out u wont notice anything.  but then it closes and it looks like a little black dot.<br>  <br>  but if you have it in for some time and it hasnt healed yet it'll look like a pimple.<br>  <br>  also depends on the gauge size|`|lCK6ahPiaa	Not really but dont take it out if yu jus recently pierced it

It was in their music video Poppin' Champagne. I don't think white shoes would look good. White basically goes with any color, so wear dark colors with it so that light colors don't clash.|`|QKGKD5qiaa	I think this to be rather stylish and elegant. Not every man can afford to wear white pants because wearing them you need to behave differently... IMHO|`|D3rfzhL9aa	I don't like it when guys where either of those things...together or separate.  And no white after labor day! :)
jvJqmliBaa	i have pale skin and i know yellow doesnt look to good on me..but when i tan a little bit it looks fine..Go get a little tan before prom and if your not into tanning beds, go and get someone to spray tan you (because the machine doesnt make it even) and they can make sure its portioned everywhere..Have fun at Prom!|`|DgVJ5bAvaa	It is possible, it depends on the actual color of yellow to skin...could you maybe find colors online that match the yellow and the skin tone so we have an idea?|`|stSyB4Mjaa	Possibly I would definitely get a tan tho...|`|ROHGnERLaa	not at all. <br>  i think you'll look greeat ! <br>  ?|`|v7OtbIAoaa	Just go to the tanning bed.  You still have time.  I think it will look great.|`|1aa144095adebf42cce12852a93fd34caa	Nope. I honestly think any color skin will look nice in yellow.|`|AA10874773	it wont look bad, but it would look alot better if you got a spray on tan!|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Your smile and personality will make any dress look pale in comparison to your beauty and effervesance.  I think you will be a star no matter what color of dress you wear.  Enjoy your prom.
6yAmCUPeaa	walk the walk<br>  talk the talk <br>  wear the bra|`|gYyW39wTaa	Confidence is the key|`|QhXL4Lilaa	You don't need anything, being sexy is a state of mind. If you are unsure about being sexy then that's you're problem right there. Tell yourself you are sexy and mean it, feeling insecure isn't sexy. Most women know how to pull it off very well, but they had to start somewhere, and practice makes perfect.<br>  <br>  Whatever makes you feel and look amazing is one way of knowing how to make a men turn their heads at you, men can't stand women who are insecure; women who are try too hard. It's all about knowing how to work with what you got.<br>  <br>  Hint: Clothes doesn't make you sexy, you make you sexy (if that makes sense) lol|`|m7o5A3pDaa	Appearing overly sexy attracts you nothing but hungry wolves, and trust me, you don't want any of those on your tail.<br>  <br>  Firstly, signs of interest and attention doesn't come in form of pickup lines so it might not appear obvious to you. What you want to do is dress with a sense of style, a tad bit of sexy like v-neck or boot cut jeans never hurt...but heavy makeups and short miniskirts are OUT.<br>  <br>  Guys like girls with good personality, which means being friendly and nice and having a good sense of humor...be the life and soul of the party: as in beloved among your friends and the word of mouth will carry out. Being active, ambitious and a little eccentric is a nice charm to work, too!<br>  <br>  And to flirt: Approach-retreats-leave him wondering. That's the almost surefire knockout formula...just make sure you meet the criteria I said, though: style(your own, doesn't have to be a la mode) charisma and upbeat.<br>  <br>  Guys: you may repeat after me, too!<br>  Style.<br>  Charisma.<br>  Upbeat.|`|JbSebJJYaa	Confidence is the most sexy thing anyone can possess (:|`|STY5pSAsaa	ok,<br>  walk around naked.<br>  or walk in stilettos.. naked of course|`|8v2AbHHsaa	play hard to get.  It allways works.|`|IQ0MjIqDaa	Be totally confident WITHOUT a man, and act like you just don't care one way or the other. That's the /best/ way to get their attention. Confidence is key. So is a good sense of humor :)|`|jvJqmliBaa	you shouldnt try to get a guys attention....you will catch his attention if hes interested in you...then you can flirt a little bit.. it works|`|vkYlr8oNaa	confidence honey!!! and mysterious!!!|`|PpGCchNPaa	Be funny and smart if you ain`t got these then go without a bra and offer favors after school.|`|1aa144095adebf42cce12852a93fd34caa	1.)

jvJqmliBaa	dont dress up to much..wear something nice and casual but do not over dress..it is a sure sign that your under age...Also dont appear to be nervous, thats a dead give away|`|AhH4r4eBaa	High heels, conservative makeup, older-looking clothes that aren't really name-brand. Especially, don't wear hollister because that's definitely a teenage thing.|`|7ntSRsZLaa	Just act extremely mature.<br>  Don't act nervous.. just go with the flow with everyone else there like you have absolutely nothing to worry about.|`|92vDzK54aa	If I were you, I would dress nicely, that is very important. Classy, you know, nice jeans and a pretty shirt or something similar to that type of style. I would wear your hair down in a pretty style, curl it or something. Just look educated and proper, but obviously relaxed enough because you are going to a comedy show! Ha ha. High heels might help. Make you taller anyways. Some casual make-up, doing up your eyes a bit and having the rest of your face more natural looking. You need to make sure you don't fall into any teenager stereotypes is all. And be confident! Make sure you don't act nervous because they may look into it. Try to have a guy check your ticket. Flirt a small amount. Just act 18.<br>  <br>  And I would check some resources to see if they I.D. you or not, because that would be bad if you went there and they I.D. anyone close to the 18 age border.|`|5vtZVLdIaa	Heels and alot of makeup, and basically just be mature its all about your attitude after that, dont talk to much if your afraid youll say something dumb. Considering your 16 thats only 2 yrs younger than 18 and that means youll probably look 18 as it is without makeup.|`|vnKbLsQdaa	ino it sounds tartish but you will need to wear alot of make-up<br>  <br>  believe me ive done this loads of times trying to get into 18 films and im 14! i got in though lol x<br>  <br>  act older, wear heels and lots of make-up ...x<br>  <br>  hope this helps x|`|IQ0MjIqDaa	Pull you hair up and wear glasses. lol That's what I used to do when I was 17. :D<br>  <br>  I know, I'm terrible. Also, dress conservatively.|`|FePjW3r1aa	well,,<br>  look kinda lke a ****.<br>  i no that sounds awful but hey it worked for me!!<br>  =))

eAa7uWVfaa	Well i just got mine done first week of feb so here it goes:<br>  <br>  How do you clean them?: I just used sea salt instead of mouth wash and it work out really week and healed quite quickly. <br>  Do they get infected easily?: Not unless you clean them<br>  How much does it hurt getin it done?: Its not so bad, a bit unconfortable but not unbearable. The pain lies in the healing the day after.<br>  is it true they cause bad breath, if so what do i use to help which wont affect the piercing?: it does not cause bad breath, you can still brush your teeth and your supposed to be using mouthwash anyway.<br>  <br>  Overall im my experience it wasnt so bad..at first i hated it only because i couldnt speak properly, over drooling, didnt eat etc. After a week im in love with it. Just clean it as directed and youll be fine.|`|kxlmcG4gaa	Clean it like any normal piercing except with mouthwash,<br>  They do a bit cause you eat food and it tends to get stuck there sometimes leaving residue.<br>  I dont know about pain, but my friend said you cant feel anything, but others say you do as its a muscle.<br>  They'll only cause Bad breath if you dont look after it properly.<br>  <br>  Try brushing your teeth after everytime you eat, and instead of using mouthwash use warm water and some salt as that will kill the bacteria.<br>  The enzymes in your mouth kill some bacteria but that doesnt mean you shouldn't clean it regulary.<br>  Leaving out the stud for a long time will cause it to close up, even if it is healed.|`|FbAlYFymaa	I got my tongue pierced about a year ago<br>  It does make your breathe smell bad but i always just carry mints with me<br>  They can get infected if you don't really clean it<br>  I personally wouldn't get one...<br>  Its really hard to make out with peope with a pierced tongue|`|iSwrEzmUaa	I wouldnt do it girly....<br>  I had a friend who did it and hers got infected. Her breath reaked for days andher tongue looked gross. (had puss)<br>  I bet your beautiful without it. :)<br>  J|`|iGkPPky9aa	Tongue piercings look trashy. Don't do it if you don't want to look like a slut :-)|`|tao83sDxaa	i wouldn't do it. here is a thought that i doubt ever crossed your mind. it will effect your ability to get a good job, that pays better than mc'donalds. you see when you go in for an interview the person will talk to you and say they will get back to you, but they won't. they will think by seeing the piercing that you are an air head, when they are looking for someone who is stable to fill the position. i hope you are understanding what i am saying and think before doing it.|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	i'm still trying to figure out if i'm getting mine done after my baby is born but my bf has his done already. <br>  <br>  you swish salt water around in your mouth a few times a day to clean it. they usually won't get infected unless you don't clean it at all. i have heard that it hurts for a second when the needle goes through and then it just hurts for a few days after and then it's done. my bf doesn't have bad breath, so i guess it just depends on if you brush your teeth or not.
qUiR4kctaa	a chunkily layered bob..<br>  or something shorter as thin hair shouldn't be grown out (growing out hair makes it thinner)
8zfEQtqMaa	You just came out of the closet.<br>  ;)|`|9iXGakohaa	So what is your question?|`|XzLUA7ataa	Ask for an appointment with your family doctor, and when you get to see the doctor, tell him about your mixed emotions and upsetting sexual urges.  Tell your parents you have not been feeling very well and want a physical check up.  The doctor will not be shocked, and he will not violate your privacy.  You will probably be given some hormonal treatment medically suited to a young person your age.  Something in your body is causing a chemical in balance, it is nothing to be ashamed of and can be medically treated.  Please seek help as soon as possible.|`|QNhyowIKaa	wait until your older and get plastic surgery?|`|t7AIAXo9aa	sorry, what are you asking? <br>  i don't get it...what's your question?|`|INyB3cMRaa	Don't ever feel alone, because i guarantee you're not the only one. Sit down with your parents and talk to them about it. Explain to them how long you've felt like this and what you think makes you feel this way. Do you have lots of sisters? There's always counselling aswell. Whatever happens make sure you're comfortable with who you are, life is too short to waste it being something you're not. Good luck sweetie x x x|`|hX1Qfs3qaa	You don't need medical help because you're transgendered! I can't believe someone would say that. You do NOT have a chemical imbalance or anything wrong with you. Talk to your parents about it. You shouldn't try to be straight.. don't ever try to be something you're not. There's nothing wrong with being transgendered.<br>  <br>  If you're afraid to talk to your parents, you can always call a children's help line, or talk to your school counsellor.

vKeBNkqnaa	if you bought them off somebody who was selling them for a loss they might be real. oakleys are never discounted not online or at the store they are always the same price. if you paid 50 and they are brand new they are probably fake.|`|OHs8yJiOaa	Probability depends on the model and the particular seller.<br>  <br>  Some of the "plastic" models like the gascans are frequently counterfeited, and you need to be most careful there.<br>  <br>  Your odds also increase if buying from a brand new member or one who's selling from places like China.<br>  <br>  Your odds also increase if you did it with a Buy It Now that seemed too low or almost too good to be true, especially when combined with the above.<br>  <br>  If you're buying a lower end model from a reputable seller, some models can indeed go in the $50 range, especially if coming without box or something comparable. If you want to know if what you receive is counterfeit, you can post photos upon receipt and get them compared with known good versions of the same model. If they are fake, as long as you paid with Paypal, you should be able to get your money back.<br>  <br>  But just because you bought a pair of Oakleys on eBay for $50 or under isn't automatically a sign they're fake.|`|EAVXgDXbaa	<a href="http://www.trade9shoes.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.trade9shoes.com</a> <br>  <br>  MSN: trade9shoesa@hotmail.com|`|q7ZWseBiaa	if you need oakley,you can try this link,it is on sale now

Also, if you press really hard, there will be an indent, but it will go back to normal, so you musn't worry. <br>  Only do this after a warm or hot shower, or after you give yourself a facial steam.

6ddbc258bcea66dd0bcbcd47cecf412daa	Revlon Colorstay. It's about $13, depending on where you buy it. It's pretty pricey for a drugstore brand, but it's comparable to MAC's Studio Fix Fluid. <br>  I'm assuming you already know how to apply foundation, but for this, you just dab a little bit, which might be hard due to the way it comes out. It's not a squirt bottle, where you press down the little applicator, it's a squeezable one. Just take a little bit and blend.<br>  After, you could use Rimmel's Stay-Matte pressed powder, and I've seen some Maybelline ones and probably a Revlon one around too. If you think Rimmel's is too expensive, you could try the Maybelline one, which is probably around $8-$15. <br>  Good luck and happy hunting!|`|h7ZuUO0Zaa	Liquid then set with a powderrr<br>  <br>  maybelline.. covergirl revlon colorstayy|`|uYdbicDCaa	Revlon Colorstay, like a previous poster mentioned....the best way I found to apply it is with a damp sponge, making it look more natural. I've tried regular foundation brushes and stippling brushes and found that the damp sponge is best for a natural finish. Try the formula for oily skin (theres 2 different formulations.) and then set it with powder (I use BE Mineral Veil, but when I run out of that I'll be trying the Colorstay powder). For me, it offers everything you mentioned, but as far as making you break out...well, everyone's skin is different and usually the best method of observation is trial and error, unfortunately. Hope this helps!|`|2bc73bf71f080d1f394b7ce41c56f444aa	I always used to wear foundation and powder and it just looked and felt disgusting by the end of the day. I switched to Cover Girl Simply Powder Foundation a few years ago and I refuse to wear foundation ever again. You should give it a try!!

ZqHqKDqEaa	If you continue washing your hair the braids will become quite fuzzy, and may even begin to unravel. <br>  <br>  To keep the scalp from becoming dry. I recommend greasing your scalp every 3-4 days or whenever it feels dry. Another remedy is to use braid spray that's not oily. This site gives a listing of tons of good brands - <a href="http://www.ebonyline.com/hair-care-by-category-braid-care.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ebonyline.com/hair-care-by-ca...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck to you.

SWS6ySo3aa	I would use a pink bridesmaids dress, all the dark will loook like your having a goth wedding. and the ring bearer, i think a little pink vest would look good underneath the chocolate brown tex, not hot pink, like a light baby pink or such, my newfew had something similar in a wedding, he was so cutee.|`|ulCN5LJiaa	Sounds very aesthetically pleasing!  I like the black / brown combo a lot.  If you could add a little black to the groom's tux as well, it would tie it all together.  Same with the groomsmen.  They will be seen next to the bridesmaids a lot, so if they had a little black in the brown, they would look nice with the bridesmaids dresses.|`|LnRBUifVaa	Both colours can go well together. Also it isn't all in one outfit so I think its go ok.|`|iUoSXKSiaa	That sounds nice. I think the ring bearer should probably brown like the groom.
2ZsRAxkuaa	MRSA is difficult to treat, as alot of antibiotics won't help, but it is treatable. Lots of people have it, and it only causes problems in already sick people.<br>  <br>  I'd guess they'd just rearrange your surgery until the treatment was complete. Your shiny new nose isn't worth an outbreak in a hospital full of already sick people.<br>  But I suppose they might proceed, and take alot of extra precautions?

Plus, I look for a girl's personality before looks.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	You are very average looking.

Is your esteem so low you need us to tell you that you are pretty? You are but that is not the point. You are opening yourself up to the possibility of some nasty comments that may hurt. Even good compliments from a bunch of people who don't know anything about you are not solid. If you take care of yourself, feel good about who you are and how you look, you shouldn't be worrying about what anyone else thinks. If you need a boost to your self esteem, do something nice for yourself.

BPrMusoLaa	Get a nice, casual, form fitting, black pants suit with a pair of patent leather pumps with your VS tee and throw a pretty chain and charm bracelet on. Or if you dont wanna do the siut, you can do a pair of black skinney jeans and cute black hipster jacket with the pumps, tee shirt and accessories. PLEASE do the all black! Its sexy and classy and you cant go wrong. You dont have to worry about if your too dressed up or not enough because the tee shirt will give you that in between look, so when you throw your two accessories on it will make sense. If you dont wanna do the pumps you can also get a flat pair of leather calf boots(black) with your black skinney jeans and you will still be dressy casual. I dont know how you look but I envisioned myself going to this event. So take my advice, the Diva is never wrong when it comes to style......HAVE FUN AT UR EVENT....Bring me a goody bag...LOL and for everybody who said you would be trying too hard wearing a VS shirt they are wrong. You can wear whatever you want! If that is really your style then go for it. Just dress up and let you accessories do the talking. You have to look at your self in the mirror and not them......Remember That!!!|`|LnRBUifVaa	I think the perfect style for that is elegant but sexy. As the other answerer said: Don't wear the VS shirt. They will think you're trying too hard. Go for the"I want to do this but I could easily be doing something else thats funner". Just try to look like yourself. Don`t go all dressed in black: you might look unapproachable. Wear some color too play up your fun and youthful side. Amuse-toi!|`|rpVQpJA7aa	I would suggest a black pantsuit with a pink colored shirt underneath. You don't want to look desperate by wearing a VS shirt.|`|u1DDrXO2aa	You don't wear what they wear but be presentable and well dressed!  and why would you wear a vs shirt im guessing you have no prior experience in this!|`|uFOO6Cryaa	Do not wear the VS shirt....i think that would just be typical...show your style|`|AA11637156	I definitely think that you should wear all black.  It is more professional and it shows that you are prepared.  If there was a cute pin you could wear on the black shirt that would be appropriate.  Not to immature, but cute and different.  Always keep in mind that you want people to take you seriously.

A7SJT50Kaa	ahem....the official name is Aluminum Foil Deflector Beanie (AFDB)<br>  here are the instructions to make your own. ...for the safety of the world *do not* let just anyone have these!!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://riverdaughter.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/tinfoil_hat_girl.jpg&imgrefurl=http://riverdaughter.wordpress.com/2008/11/18/tin-foil-hat-tuesday-open-thread/%3Freferer%3Dsphere_search&usg=__Ev4s5qnNjj18IL3vi2R3_NwRX7c=&h=533&w=402&sz=42&hl=en&start=8&um=1&tbnid=K8R8paByMxTFBM:&tbnh=132&tbnw=100&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dtin%2Bfoil%2Bhat%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DN" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...</a><br>  <br>  ****A Note About The Shiny Side:<br>  It can't be stressed enough how important it is to have the shiny side pointing out. This is needed because the shiny side is most reflective to psychotronic radiation, while the dull side can actually, in certain environmental conditions, absorb it. However, as is illustrated in the instructions above, it is also wise to complement this with a layer of foil pointing shiny side in. This will keep your brain waves, which are also reflected by the shiny side, from being picked up by mind-reading equipment. There is a small number of aluminum foil researchers who believe that this may cause an alpha-wave harmonic to build up in the skull resulting in memory loss or pseudo-religious visions, but their findings have never been replicated by the aluminum foil research community at large. Even if their findings are validated, the risk involved is small compared to the potential of mind-intrusion.<br>  <br>  IRISH ROSIE: if you like that, check me out! ;-)<br>  <a href="http://riverdaughter.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/tinfoil_hat_girl.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://riverdaughter.files.wordpress.com...</a>|`|qQqC2cHIaa	Tin foil is actually made from aluminum.

Utp2nM8waa	Another answerer wonders why so many mothers have issues with shaving - I wonder how many mothers anyone actually knows that actually have an issue.  Moms love their children more than you can possibly imagine and are really OK with so many things that youngsters are nervous about discussing.  Shaving is a normal part of growing up and most Moms are going to be just fine with this.<br>  <br>  I suggest you ask your Mom to get you a book called "The Care and Keeping of You".  It addresses hair, shaving, periods, bras, manicures, pimples - everything.  My daughter has it and many times after reading it will ask questions.  If you're nervous about bringing up these normal subjects, the book allows an easy way to begin a conversation.  Like, 'Hey Mom, I was reading about deodorants in this book, and I think I could use one'.  <br>  <br>  My daughter tried shaving her legs when she was 7.  She is almost 11 now and shaves now and then.  No biggie.  It won't be for your Mom either, I'm sure.  She will enjoy watching and helping you grow up, just like you're supposed to.|`|uqMK3rUZaa	Shaving is nothing to be embarrassed about. If your mom keeps a shopping list, write razors on there. If you trust your mom and get along with her, tell her you've started shaving and need razors. If you don't feel comfortable telling her and don't want her buying razors for you, go to the store with someone you feel comfortable with and buy razors. Like sharing makeup, sharing razors is a no-no. If you have an STD or anything that can be passed along through blood, sharing razors is dangerous. Besides, if you use the same razor too often the blades wear down, and she might catch on after a while.|`|AA11404742	Probably not, unless you are infected with something.  In that case, you shouldn't be sharing a razor.<br>  <br>  But disposables are cheap - a few dollars for a dozen.  Go grab some after school.|`|Vo4tcSf3aa	well i mean its not that serious...if you dont cut yourself nothing can be passed on...but it is a little unsanitary....why dont you just talk to your  mom about shaving tell her that your getting older and you think its time....and tell her your hair is making you self concious....if she doesnt get it then buy yourself some and hide them.|`|dOeE9GCcaa	You shouldnt use someone elses razor... even if it is your own mom. You should really buy a pack for yourself and hide them. If you think about it, you wouldnt use her toothbrush would you? Its not sanitary.|`|hX1Qfs3qaa	She probably knows you're shaving because her blades are getting dull a lot faster than usual.

oVxr5B3Eaa	Wash them with fabric softener. The reason is because they are likely tight (right?) as well as stiff. If they are softer (or looser) this won't happen, but as you likely don't want to wear looser jeans, go for softer.

qxrr69bnaa	It's best to use lotions intended for use in tanning beds.  Anything else may damage the acrylics (plastics you lie on) in the bed.  Ask the salon employees for suggestions.

Yeah, almost all sunless tanners will turn you orange.  Its probably safer (and better looking) to use tanning lotion from the salon.<br>  <br>  *Edit*<br>  You could get the tanning lotions with bronzer in them!|`|HlOjmGXRaa	You can. That is basically what bronzers are.|`|R1yxXGObaa	I use lotions that are a mix.

The thing most people don't realize is that many drugstore brands are sub-divisions of department store brands. L'Oreal is a division of Lancome. I've heard the only difference is the pigment, which can be expensive for companies to add to their products.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	They just say that to make you spend more money, just read the ingredient's on both..|`|bhyUX6kkaa	You want to be careful who is telling you that these company have harmful chemicals in them. <br>  A lot of times this is coming from competing makeup companies.<br>  <br>  It's not to say that all products are good for your skin, but I would make sure to wash off what ever you're using at the end of the day and you should be fine, even mineral makeup.

qo8SalPIaa	You might want to call the tattoo shop itself. Some tattoo artist will provide touchup work for free ( depending where you get the tattoo and how you take care of it). But definitely wait until the scabbing and peeling is gone. I know when I got all 3 of mine, they said to not submerge or let water directly hit it ( like in the shower- just let the water run over it) for 3 weeks, and  wait 6 months before I could swim.. So I waited that long to actually submege it even in bath water.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Until the scabbing is gone.  So depending on the way you heal, roughly about a week or 2 give or take.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	At least two weeks, preferably until it's fully healed.|`|br1FB5rraa	I would say to wait about 40 days

TPg4FRVsaa	por activs moisturizer is HORRIBLEE.. it does a terrible job in putting back the moisture in your face after the toner and cleanser have stripped you of it. id suggest using neutrogena's SPF 15 moisturizer after you use the three main products of pr active (cleanser, toner, repairing lotion) and its fine to use at night. no harm
a6j0cwgqaa	I use mine where ever the skin is dry at any given time! I sleep in the moisturizer all the time too! I love Proactiv's moisturizer!

szWqfM98aa	I have been using Lancome for years. For wrinkles you want to use the High Resolution not the Renergie line. The Renergie Line is more for the lifting of the face such as the puppet frown lines you get around the mouth. I am 46 and have a wrinkle just above my nose at the edge of my eyebrow and the High Resolution fills it in perfectly. In fact they just came out with a new version of it saying it fills up to 3X. I have not tried it yet but am going to get a free sample today from Belks. I also use the Renergie line for lifting and it works well too but I noticed that it works better when I apply Lumene firming cream over it. This can be purchased at CVS and Target. I have tried both of these creams individually but don't get near the results as using them together. The Lumene is cheaper so I use it over my whole face and only use the Lancome on the specific wrinkled areas. I think for you only being concerned about lines the High Resolution is definately the way to go.|`|90bebc89ee072c1f94915d47a65c7565aa	im only 19, and I believe that the younger you are when you start treating your skin the longer you'll have younger looking skin.<br>  <br>  Since they are anti-aging creams not un-aging creams, they can probably only fix minor things and have a temporary tightening and lifting effect after continuous use. You are more likely to see results from the renergie microlift rare because it is stronger than the renergie line itself. These creams are most likely to fix only minor things.<br>  <br>  -But, everything your talking about is most likely really minor because your not 50, so your probably good!  Try the regular renergie line, drink lots of water, and make sure to wear spf! (im sure they have spf in them)<br>  <br>  hope I could help!|`|eedeKRUtaa	Why not?  Prevention of wrinkles is easier and cheaper than surgical/laser procedures.|`|SqNoMz7vaa	Sorry, I don't get wrinkles yet, I'm 19. LoL. But I've heard from my mom that both of the things you mentioned are good.|`|dirZbAlUaa	I currently work for Lancome, and if you are looking to help already visible lines, either cream would work for you. The difference between Renergie and Renergie Microlift, is that microlift is for loss of firmess, whereas just plain Renergie is not. Are you talking about the face cream, or spefically for the eye area? If you have severely dry skin around the eye area, I could also recommend the Absolue eye cream. The Absolue line is made specifically for very dry skin. If you go to your local Lancome counter, they have what I call a "cheat sheet" guide that tells you about each cream and what each one will do for your skin. I would try going there and sitting down for a consultation with them.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Lancome has some amazing products!|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	Both are excellent.  In fact, I switch between the two.  I love Lancome.|`|KDXisAOlaa	the first one

Have you ever put sponge curlers in it after you washed it and its still wet?  Separate your hair into 1 inch wide sections and roll each one on a sponge curler up to about chin length. Sleep with them in and in the morning you will have adorable perfect spiral curls.<br>  What color are your eyes?  Try losing the black eyeliner as it looks like of whorish that thick- try using a much thinner application of a dark brown that would look better with your skin tone- and using eyeshadow in the crease of your eye that would make the eyes pop- if you have blue eyes, use brown shimmery shadow.  If they are brown, use light shimmery blue.  If they are hazel, use brown and pink.  If they are green, use purple.|`|LnRBUifVaa	For clothes:I think you need to go for bright colours that announce spring.

Use a volumising mascara for top and a bit of bottom lashes. Wear a natural colour eye shadow like light brown or beige on your eye lids. On the top lids, with a eyeliner pencil, do a thin line of black right before your lash line, it helps define the eyes and brings out the colour.<br>  <br>  Also, correct me if i'm wrong, but i think you're wearing foundation on your lips, i would say leave your lips natural and shiny.<br>  <br>  As for clothing, you would really suit bo-ho or something edgy. Maybe floral print, i would suit your hair colour nd hairstyle.<br>  <br>  You could curl your hair or crimple parts of it :D if you've got one of those plaited headbands i would put that on for a more bo-ho look :D<br>  <br>  hope i helped :D<br>  <br>  x|`|ZrS4I4lNaa	Your pretty anyway - if i were you i'd just go more natural.......less eye makeup perhaps? <br>  <br>  Personally I think you can't beat a nice tan and natural makeup i.e. light foundation, touch of blusher on the cheek bones and a bit of mascara and lip gloss.

She has a hard time finding a guy that is her height.  She has had several boyfriends that are shorter than her, and she is very self conscious about it. It really does not seem to bother the guys very much though.<br>  I use to when I was younger think it looked odd.  However, remember it is not what a person looks like , including how tall they are that makes the relationship.  It's no different than seeing a slim person with a heavier person or a person with a missing limb, if you like that person then the relationship deserves a chance irregardless of what other people may think.  That's the trouble, people judge by sight.|`|gz5O9Tbpaa	I'm almost 6 feet tall. I was taller than most men when I was 15 years old. It's something I have had to deal with all of my life. So I'm kinda over it. It's only an issue for me if the man I date makes it one. I havent dated anyone taller than me, it only just barely taller than me. My husband is about half an inch taller than me. He doesn't care that I'm so tall. I dont care that he's not three inches taller than me. <br>  <br>  My mother is 5'4" and my father is 6'7" and I must say it's MUCH easier for the man to be the taller one in the relationship. <br>  <br>  So as long as this guy is comfortable with himself, it shouldn't be an issue. Although, I had to break up with one guy because he just couldn't get over the height difference. He was only 2 inches shorter than me but he wouldn't let it go. And I wasn't going to mess with it any longer. If he wasn't confident in himself, I wasn't going to stay with him.|`|3CTcs5u6aa	Im 6 1 too!!<br>  <br>  and im in Japan!

lyp6JEcEaa	Congrats on looking out for your health and skin. I actually find natural/organic brands are much better quality than mainstream brands, you will be very surprised how much better your skin looks and feels once you make the switch from chemical laden products. One of the biggest chemicals you should stay away from (and there is a huge laundry list) is PARABENS. These are a chemical preservative with direct links to cancer. It is for this reason I quit using BARE ESCENTUALS (Bare Minerals) because they use Parabens in their mineral veils and skincare. It makse me mad because they try and say no preservatives, but if you flip over your veil, "Hello Preservatives!". I did a lot of research online and found a completley natural NO Preservative company called Faerie Organic. Their mineral foundation is the best thing I have ever used. Being a pro makeup artist, I have used a lot of brands, commercial, mainstream, drugstore, organic. This is my favorite yet. They are light and airy, cover very well and leave a gorgeous dewy glow. I recommend them to everybody. Theri minerals contain natural SPF 15, they are anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial (helps acne while you wear it). In comparing them to Bare Escentuals they are far better in my opinion. They have free sample kits at their site <a href="http://www.faerieorganic.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.faerieorganic.com</a>|`|63a5263489efd09b002b83caf0e1b446aa	Sometime last year I asked a question about mineral makeup and a girl gave me a link I checke dit out and I love the makeup...its mineral..vegan so no harsh chemicals....its CHEAP and they sell powder foundation blush eyeshadow evrything...the site is www.simplly-minerals.com....I visited a few weeks ago and it was under construction though mayb eits up by now....theyre powder you can pick the size you want you can get  a trail size if you choose to and it dirt cheap and it feels better than the bare minerals makeup|`|Pn9tPYKbaa	okay. well i was in the same position as you, when it came to face make-up. so i switched to bareMinerals. amazing. i got some for christmas last year, and i still have it. it doesnt take very much to make your face look very natural and clean, and perfect. it is made out of all natural minerals, good for the skin, and make the skin look AMAZING!!:) you can sleep in it, and is helps prevent pimples. it also has an all natural 15spf sunblocl i it. it is a powder type make-up, but feels like cream when rubbed together in between fingers:) its amazing. heres the bareminerals web site:))<br>  <a href="http://bareminerals.com/" rel="nofollow">http://bareminerals.com/</a><br>  <br>  its pricey, but worth it. it last me the whole year.<br>  as for thing<br>  <br>   you should watch out for in make-up here are some ingredents<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Aluminum Albumin <br>  Ammonium glycolate Ceresin <br>  Artificial colours Cl 77267 (bone charcoal)<br>  Cl 77268 (black bone charcoal) <br>  Benzoates: sodium benzoate, benzoic acid Collagen <br>  BHT, BHA Ectoin: hydroxyectoin  <br>  DEA, MEA, TEA Elastin <br>  Diamines: phenylenediamines Fish <br>  Dibutyl phthalate Gelatin <br>  Dimethicone Hyaluronic acid <br>  FD & C, D & C colours Keratin <br>  Formaldehydes: imidazolidinyl urea,<br>  DMDM hydantoin, quaternium 15, <br>  2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1, 3 diol Lanolin <br>  Hydroquinone Mink Oil <br>  Isopropanolamine Musk <br>  Isopropyl alcohol Ovum <br>  Keratolytic chemicals: hydroxyl acids,<br>  glycolic acids, retinoic acids Phosphatidylcholine <br>  Methylisothiazolinone Placenta <br>  Oleates: decyloleate Roe <br>  Parabens Salmo <br>  Parrafin Serum albumin <br>  Phenoxyyethanol Squalenes <br>  Propylene glycol (petroleum derived) Tallow <br>  Pthalates Unipertan <br>  Sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate   <br>  Sorbitans   <br>  Toluene   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>  i know lots of em.<br>  <br>  also another kind of make-up is sheercover.but i dont use it. my friend does. and it works great to:) but a bit more pricey, well have fun:)

This negative thing about this is that it may become hot, uncomfortable, or the top of the panty hose may wind up rolling down over the waist of your pants which would be embarrassing, because at that point there is no way to make them stay back up.<br>  PLEASE do not wear a garter belt with stockings underneath your pants, that is not acceptable unless you are planning on going to a cross dressing strip club and being one of the show girls.|`|zX80VRbmaa	Of course you can wear pantyhose under pants.

Support Pantyhose is just a piece of legwear and should be considered unisex, since both men and women have legs and both need healthy-looking legs<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pantyhose-legwear-fashion.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://pantyhose-legwear-fashion.blogspo...</a>|`|BPrMusoLaa	If you are comfortable with it just do the stockings. Although, they have really cute knee high and over the knee socks.Or thigh high socks. I wear thigh high socks because they are more comfortable for me than stocking and knee highs and you can get some really pretty ones instead of your basic stockings.|`|AA10419356	If you live in a cold climate, I would say pantyhouse ... but if the weather is mild (at least spring-like), then I'd go for thigh-highs.

You could wear a garter, but I don't think most women don't anymore.  I sure know I don't. However, most young women wear socks or barefeet.  My mother wears stockings and pantyhose, but I do not and no one my age does either.
kCdISEGqaa	Aside form searching Google for you and doing all the work, I would like to give you a suggestion.  Take your ideas to an artist and see what they come up with.  I love it when people come to me with just an idea, it let's me be creative and come up with a few ideas.  When we consult, I tell the client, this is what I'm thinking, and I draw a design and see if they like it.  If not, we can modify or start fresh.  Best wishes!|`|qMCv8mOCaa	Check out TattooArtists.org and BMEInk.com.

AA12227599	Your mother is right as usual. You only need to do the roots. If it is a permanent color the only part that should not be that color is the new hair that has grown, therefore you only need to do the roots. If you do you entire hair you will do damage to it. <br>  p.s always trust mom:)|`|tjRuKlJaaa	it depends if the first color has faded or not. If it has than dye all of it...if it hasn't only dye the tips...no matter what some will probably be darker.|`|3LwTU9duaa	dying it alot will cause it to get frizzy && fried. i suggest just going to get your roots done.|`|wGCCMjVsaa	just the roots, to much hair chemicals will make it fall out or go like straw|`|Mlx5j4zFaa	I usually do my hole head cause my hair doesn't hold color very well.

Get a picture online of something you like and go around asking stylists if they can do this for you. Most of them will do it.|`|eMSv7RwYaa	i think it's a good idea to get it done professional and to tell the truth i expect most of the other girls get it done at the hairdressers as well.

90bebc89ee072c1f94915d47a65c7565aa	I have recently bought the new Maybelline Dream Liquid Mousse and it works well, because I get oily skin too. It goes on SO smooth if you use a foundation brush, then buff it smoother after you apply it with a clean powder brush. try using a "shine free" or "matte" translucent finishing powder, and put a good brushing of that on. carry it with you throughout the day to blot the oil. Maybelline, Revlon, Covergirl, etc all carry matte translucent powders and they have the same basic ingredients. Make sure to get translucent because you dont want to be adding extra make up to your face throughout the day.<br>  <br>  I've never found a foundation to actually keep me matte ALL DAY, and I have used chanel and prescriptives ranging from 32 to 55 bucks! now I'm back to maybelline and its great.<br>  <br>  -make sure to match your skin color well! I suggest looking at the fair ivory tones since your pale. Good luck!|`|Hx5ugKZnaa	Hey<br>  I kinda had the same problem in the fact that i have fair skin and found that some foundation had 2 much of an orange tint.<br>  Luckily I found the perfect foundation when I went to a bodyshop party.<br>  The liquid foundation costs ￡12 and is called Moisture Foundation and also has SPF 15.<br>  It has a really light coverage that doesn't clog pores or feel too heavy on your skin. It looks really natural but has a matte texture so doesn't lead to the dreaded 'shine'. <br>  Im currently using number 5 and have found its the perfect colour for my skin... don't let the colour in the bottle fool you as it looks quite dark, but blends in easily with your own skin colour.<br>  They have a big selection in all bodyshop shops and have other products that match such as powder and concealers.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  xx|`|GM3zog4Jaa	You should be suing an oil free foundation. I haven't tried those ones but Loreal foundations seem to be really good but I really don't like maybelline & wouldn't recommend it.<br>  Other than that, I'd try revlon oil free foundation. I don't know the exact name but I am sure I have seen it.<br>  Otherwise, I recommend a mattifying primer UNDER your foundation. I tested this one & I quite liked it but make sure you try it first before you buy it in case it doesn't suit ur skin. It is by M&S Autograph make-up & is called Autograph Illusions Illuminating Mattifying Gel.<br>  This is the link for it:<a href="http://www.marksandspencer.com/gp/product/B000OTGEU2/ref=pd_sbs_4/275-6740152-6730447?ie=UTF8&mnSBrand=core" rel="nofollow">http://www.marksandspencer.com/gp/produc...</a>|`|u1qsv0sAaa	my skin is kinda the same <br>  i have trouble finding the right colour as i am very fair and have oily skin<br>  i have tried some really expensive foundations in the past but none of them were what i wanted<br>  <br>  i now use bobbi brown <br>  they do fair shades and the foundations stay put<br>  <br>  i use this <a href="http://www.bobbibrown.co.uk/templates/products/sp.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CAT6087&PRODUCT_ID=PROD73041" rel="nofollow">http://www.bobbibrown.co.uk/templates/pr...</a>  it is moisturising so you may think that it makes your skin more oily but it doesn't if you put this: <a href="http://www.bobbibrown.co.uk/templates/products/sp.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CAT6090&PRODUCT_ID=PROD72508" rel="nofollow">http://www.bobbibrown.co.uk/templates/pr...</a>      on top to set the foundation it also takes off the oil.

Make sure its the body wash... i tried the soap and it not that great.<br>  Then the fun part begins<br>  <br>  <br>  When your in the shower and your done with your baithing routine and your ready to get out take 3 extra minutes and  take a washcloth, loufa (i think that what they call them) or your hands  and Pour a decent amount of body wash into you washcloth, loufa or hands.<br>  <br>  Work into a lather on your back.<br>  When youve got your back all lathered up...Dont let the shower water rinse it off. (this is key) <br>   let the body wash sit on your back for 2 or 3 mintutes. When you feel<br>  like the 3 minutes have passed rinse it off.... well.<br>  <br>  Do this everyday. (unless you have sensitive skin) Then do it evry other day.<br>  <br>  <br>  Youll see a noticable diffrence in about 10 days and it should be gone in about two weeks.<br>  <br>  Youll be able to wear your backless stuff in no time :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.<br>  <br>  ~J|`|H7L66ynJaa	I would seek the advice of your doctor ypou may have a bacterial infection that will quickly respond to treatment.|`|5jsMY4RIaa	I had that on my shoulders.

GqPnK0OBaa	alright, i have always had medium length hair and i have  small face. i like it because its versitile. now, i've also had long hair(big curly poofy face suffocating hair lol)<br>  the way to make the hair look like its not hiding your face is to simply put a headband on and pull the hair back a bit, you can also use clips to push some hair back and reveal your face. what im saying is that even though you have a small face, many hair styles can work for you, it all depends on your style and what you'd like to do with your hair. =)<br>  hope this helps.|`|adwkFYYraa	I would say to put in a lot of layers, to make it seem like you have less hair and a rounder face.

The main reason to do this is to give a guy something to compliment you on so he has an excuse to talk to you.  So, the accessory has to be something the guy will notice (so that purse doesn't count), and it is better if it is interesting and not like anything he's seen before.  <br>  <br>  Most of attractiveness comes from your mouth, not your clothes, but that's the best advice I have on dressing attractively.|`|pcvQM5rDaa	nice site of breasts<br>  not that much make up <br>  not ugly
EZHZW7QFaa	Dam i can't remember the names of the eyeshadows but go to MAC and get any shade that is in the gold, bronze, coppery family..i think that when really dark skinned girls wear those shades it look BEAUTIFUL - try it! <3|`|EeLOswfZaa	Well if your very very dark lighter colors r best. Avoid really light silvers and really light cream colors unless its being used on the inner corners of the eye or to highlight the brow, or for holidays. If u sweep these really light colors across your eye compared to ur dark skin you risk looking like a panda. The same applies to when really light skinned women ( like me, & yes i am ashamed) wear midnight eyeshadow and end up lookin like raccoons.Ive seen it, its not pretty.Long Lasting colors r best because they don't rub off, and it wont look like the color disappears on your face. Try i-mark custom pick eyeshadow in tart from MARK.. Its a pretty light purple that's perfect for spring its not long lasting though, so u might have to re apply. Also try TRUE COLOR EYESHADOW SINGLE in Turquoise from Avon, color stays true for up to 12 hours. Greens & purples always look good on dark skin. Best wishes!!|`|91e9083de3605be8e58e4cb70855e350aa	i think Sapphire blues ,plums, shades of brown, and bronze would be pretty<br>  and i think you can wear dark colors..you don't have to be limited..just find what works for you by trial and error<br>  <br>  you may want to check out these girls on youtube for specific brands<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/LRen1013" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/LRen1013</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Kerisha25" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/Kerisha25</a>|`|1wGyh4Uzaa	okay u shuld use like a lavender stay away from dark colors or colors that are close to gold like yellow i say a light purple but dont put to much on try it n see if u like but NO DARK COLORS|`|btPPw1FHaa	M.A.C.'s Gorgeous Gold and or Bright Sunshine|`|lEfxeub1aa	I can't recommend you a brand, but choose something metallic, like bronze, it'll look good on you.

Don't pull on the big pieces of dead skin as this will irritate your lips.Instead, twirl the larger pieces around until they come off. After showering, put on some chapped stick with aloe on. Throughout the day, rub your fingers over your lips and you will remove more dead skin. Also after eating it's a good idea to not only rinse your mouth, but your lips as well. Drink plenty of water. If this doesn't work, see your pharmacist and ask for some other suggestions.

XfFFGvtgaa	I completely agree. During this first half of my senior years, when I was still 17, my mom took me to get my lip pierced. Within a few days, the principal, who walked around the cafeteria during lunch, would come up to me and tell me it needed to come out. She came over and kind of talked under her breath saying "you know you aren't supposed to have that. You're such a pretty girl and you don't want to ruin your face."<br>  <br>  And my first thought, was that is she saying I'm no longer pretty? And if she is, I couldn't care less, because I like it. However, there was a kid in school who'd had his lip pierced for a couple years. I guess since he fit the profile of someone who should have piercings, he was allowed. I was totally offended and did not take it out. I got a lot of crap from all my teachers.<br>  <br>  I think it's a ridiculous rule. I never once had detention and never caused trouble, yet because I had a lip piercing, I was classified as a troublemaker.<br>  <br>  EDIT- I get that schools are trying to keep their image clean and help prepare kids for the real world, but I feel like that is the purpose for college. High school teaches you the necessary subjects to get into a college that will teach how to be a productive member of society (not that you need college to do so.) So when you're a kid, why not live it up? There isn't much time between high school graduation and trying to make it in the real world. Why not experiment with styles and find what fits you; be it piercings, crazy hair dye, tattoos, etc.|`|2ZsRAxkuaa	I don't think under 16s should be getting any questionable piercings anyway, other than normalish ear ones.<br>  So it isn't a problem for me. I waited out my school years for piercings, and am glad for it. The one kid with a lip piercing had his pulled out in a fight. They make really easy targets.<br>  <br>  But you sign a contract with the school before you go there, saying to follow their rules, including dress code.<br>  So its your problem really..<br>  <br>  When you get older its just the same with jobs.|`|rGWiOVDIaa	When you grow up and get a job they will tell you pink hair and a gaged ears are not acceptable. Why wouldn't a school tell you the same thing? There's nothing wrong with either. It's just not work/school appropriate. A set of earrings or a belly button (no one can see that) is no biggie. If they are banning that then I would have to agree that that is messed up.<br>  <br>  I'm sure most will disagree on here, but it's still true.|`|T864ejaiaa	i think it's good. it's called distraction. live with it. in the end you will appreciate the rules.|`|EaSEjCMZaa	I think it's dumb, too because in my opinion, having uniforms and banning piercings is preventing kids/young adults from engaging in self-expression and individuality. Schools should be encouraging this instead of banning it, but then again I can understand why they'd want to do that. A school in my state recently had to make all their students wear uniforms because this girl that went there was teased so much about how she dressed that she committed suicide. I guess I wouldn't be so mad about uniforms, but as for the piercings...I'd be upset because I have snakebites and my ears pierced a couple times.|`|XwXuJIF8aa	They have it at my work place. And people have to cover their tatoos. <br>  So get used to it, when you get older and want to go to work, they will place restrictions on your dresscode there too.|`|rpN9fD20aa	i agree! my school banned body piercings and told us what color hair we could or couldn't have (like pink, blue..etc..)<br>  <br>  it's ridiculous!|`|DuG9NaaZaa	i think you should be able to have like your ears but not all over your face|`|vZ4NXlBmaa	I think it's great...especially in the case of little kids who type:<br>  wut<br>  c<br>  u<br>  & ur|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Okay before I begin I'll say I'm a total advocate of body mods - I have no problem about that - and back at school I was always being told to take piercings out and dye my hair a 'sensible colour'.<br>  <br>  But having grown up a little bit... I can completely see where they're coming from.<br>  <br>  Firstly, like it or not, you, along with the rest of their students, are a walking advertisement for their school. Schools rely heavily on image, and it does not present a good image to potential parents, governors or the media, to have children coming in and out of their school with visible piercings.<br>  <br>  Secondly, it is about discipline and preparation for the 'real world'. When you get into the world of work, you will find yourself experiencing similar restrictions. As a working adult, you cannot do whatever takes your fancy then, either. I know it sucks but that is just life. And the entire point of school is to prepare you for life as a working adult, not just academically but all round. This doesn't stop you from getting a piercing in the summer holidays, letting it heal and then taking it in and out before and after school, just like you would be able to when you are working.<br>  <br>  The simple fact is that they DO have the right. You are being educated by them, and you are at their mercy. You chose to be there, they didn't invite you, and on those terms you could choose to be at a more liberal school as far as they are concerned, and not have to comply with their rules. But by remaining within their institution, they unfortunately have every right to lay down rules and 'make' you do anything they want within the realms of legal and moral allowances.|`|HHyny0JSaa	Think of school as a practice for being in the real working world. Most jobs don't allow visible tattoos and piercings either. Besides you are still a minor. When you are 18 you can make decisions about your own life and be as pierced as you want to be. Until then keep them to your ears. Besides, according to you if its ok for school to tell you what to wear, and you wear body jewelry......., then I guess you answered your own question

Anaerobic bacteria, which flourish when your body doesn't have enough oxygen, may well be the cause of your body odor. As the body's metabolism goes to work, it gives off odors which is the body's way of ridding itself of waste products. Any imbalances in metabolism will result in stronger odors.<br>  <br>  Since we are talking about waste products you must consider toxins as a possible cause of body odor. In today's world we are bombarded with toxins in our homes, food, and air that accumulate in the body when the organs of elimination cannot dispose of them. The liver and intestines may be clogged up, causing odors to emanate from the body,   <br>  <br>  Dietary imbalances, resulting in constipation or a deficiency of magnesium or zinc may be other causes of body odor. See our Constipation section for causes and remedies. Because of a person's body chemistry, some people who eat large quantities of meat or who are vegetarians have a very distinctive body odor which can be quite offensive. Some individuals cannot metabolize foods containing large amounts of choline, such as eggs, fish, liver and legumes. The result is a "fishy" smell. If you are one of these people, cut out these products and see if this is the cause of your odor. Certain foods and drinks, such as onions, garlic, curry, certain spicy foods, coffee and alcohol, are also prime causes. Fried and baked goods may contain rancid fats and oils that lead to body odor. <br>  <br>  Sweat glands (apocrine glands) under the arms and in the groin secrete a substance that is the major non-food/drink related cause of body odor. This substance, which contains protein, carbohydrates, and lipids, often secreted by a surge in sex hormones caused by tense moments or emotional stress, is quickly attacked by bacteria, causing odor. Also, today children are starting puberty much earlier, and this change in hormones may lead to body odor in children younger than previously. Estrogen dominance, often caused by petrochemical products, may trigger the earlier puberty. Drinking sodas out of plastic bottles is one of the leading causes of estrogen dominance. <br>  <br>  There may be underlying causes of excessive sweating, such as low blood sugar, liver disease, diabetes, parasites, metabolic dysfunction, menopause, or emotional stress (anger, fear, excitement). Excessive sweat may be on the forehead, palms, soles of the feet or the underarms.

IowG78BGaa	um none! i dye my hair and straiten it all the time and it only fades from the sun (i live in the phoenix valley, the desert). so it should be fine even more than once as long as you condition your hair so you wont get split ends if you decide to straiten it alot.|`|v0r3VgbVaa	i don't think it will cause any damage... but i have this straightener at home that guarantees no damage at all. its an amika. they are mostly in malls if you want one|`|HVc8kBcvaa	Hi! No worries, the color won't fade from one heat styling, especially since your hair sound insanely healthy compared to most people's because you don't use heat often.  Water is actually your enemy, so washing your hair less often will result in the color fading less quickly.  Demi color does have a bit of peroxide in it just to get the color to stick in the hair shaft better, so it's not like semi-permanent which fades a lot faster than demi.  You'll be fine with using heat but I recommend using a heat protectant spray/lotion before straightening.|`|Zjb4p1TRaa	I don't think it'd fade it at all.<br>  What gave you that idea?
l6s1DMB6aa	I'm not certain if it has perfumes in it that might be causing you to react.  I would suggest a natural protein and olive oil base serum that is for all hair types and is fantastic!

EL45UeUJaa	Honestly you dont need the whole lenses and eye glue nessacarily to pull of the Ulzzang look. But its mostly Korean/Chinese/etc that try to pull it off...but anyone can do it, and i've seen many girls of other ethnic backgrounds pull it off well.<br>  <br>  Apply lotion to your face while its clean, then apply concealer arent your eyes, to eliminate bags. Then apply a foundation. Take a light pink blush and add it to your cheeks. Then take a white eye pencil and line your lower waterline. Take a black eyeliner pencil and line your upper inner water line, line halfway across your lower waterline to open them, then line your upper eyelid and wing it out a big to make your eyes appear wider. Apply a white shadow to the inner corners of your eyes. Curl your lashes and apply black mascara.<br>   :D hope i was of help.

I have that naturally.|`|bozG3qcFaa	Perms give you spirally very tight curls and if you want to straighten them it becomes hard to do so because they are so curly. I would say you're better off by just curling your hair with a good curler or scrunching your hair, its more natural and if you ever want to switch it up by straightening your hair you can do that too. Also until your hair grows completely out you will still have the curls in your hair which you might get tired of really fast.|`|rrou7znnaa	No. my hair is curly. Curly hair is pretty on some people. be careful with perms though, they damage hair.|`|eMSv7RwYaa	yes curly hair will make your head look wider. long straight hair is preferable for someone with a round face.|`|IowG78BGaa	no it really depends if ur hair is long or not.

This condition is usually hereditary, but can be aggravated by lack of sleep, allergies, pollution and even constant use of contact lenses. Because there is no bone directly supporting this skin and it’s so delicate, it often darkens as you age even without the above problems. This area is also often overworked especially as we tend to rub tired or irritated eyes. <br>  <br>  Lightening agents contacting natural ingredients like vitamin C, berberry acid and arbutin may be sparingly used on these areas at bedtime. Maintain a regular lifestyle with frequent meals, regular exercise and an adequate water intake. Taking supplements containing iron, vitamin C and anti-oxidants definitely add a benefit to your problem.|`|Vp2wKwdDaa	you can lay down and put sliced cucumbers on your eyes or cold coffee bags on your eyes... this helps the blood flow under your thin skin.

My make-up looks really natural. I use a light pink blush(not MUCH). If u use lengthening mascara(the one with a white end and black end, it's at target and called XL length). For a smokey eye just put a light brown color on the inside and slowly get darker as you go to the outside of your eye lid(not tooooooo dark on the brown. Try some light blue eyeshadow(most peoples eyes pop with it and add a little sparkle, like shiny silver, but only at little.) Natural make-up is all about moderation, soo never use too much and make your lips a nude, light color with a dash of glam. Like a shiny light brown! Also, NEVER use eye liner it make all of your face look unnatural.|`|bhyUX6kkaa	You are going to need more earthy colors for the natural look, but that is obvious.

yy9EHu9Eaa	I don't 'go' tanning exactly but seeing as I live in such a crummy area of Northwest England I hardly get a chance to be in the sunshine.<br>  <br>  So if it is warm and sunny do go lie outside if I can, but I do try to put on sunscreen, I enjoy the warmth but not the tan lines, skin cancer etc.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	Because they like being tan and see being tan as being more attractive, also pale skin shows imperfections a lot more than darker skin. Tanning also gives you vitamin D, which makes you happy. So subconsciously, tanning calms people and makes them happier. <br>  <br>  Also, people don't worry about something that doesn't happen immediately. All they see is the tan skin, not the wrinkles, dark marks, and cancer down the road.|`|bacf6df503bae1003891ca7a81e36298aa	Because they think it will never happen to them and it's easier than plastering cream all over your self every few days to maintain a healthy looking glow. Spray tans have improved somewhat, although I still find they look a little on the orange side. Dove moisturiser looks quite natural and is quite fun if you have a partner who can rub it all over you!|`|HlOjmGXRaa	The same reason people smoke, overeat, and drink. We all like one thing or another and their are bad effects to all. So, if you don't smoke, your never overeat or drink.... then you have room to talk.

I tan because it is relaxing.|`|jeX5VZAtaa	I tan everyday pretty much it makes me look nicer and feel good!|`|i5FP4Vbraa	How do you tell us pensioners from ordinary people?

It's free.|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	Still go tanning, or real tan? What do you mean.....since a tanning bed tan is called fake bake, Im just not sure. Anyways, I lay out in the sun in the summer time, and I also fake bake,not every day, or even every week, just for a nice base tan. I personally like having the nice little golden brown to myself, brings out my eyes, makes my legs look smoother.....it also helps with occasionally with break outs. Some people dont worry about cancer and again, I figure I am young enough now, Im going to enjoy myself, look good now, while I want to.....|`|AA11352641	They are thinking about the immediate results, not long term consequences. Many people don't see skin cancer as serious, or likely to happen to them. I was always protective of my skin which burns very easily, and now I'm glad I was. I went to my 10 year high school reunion, and oh my the years certainly show on some of those girls!|`|kCSJyM8Laa	Because they do not believe it will happen to them.  My dear, I grew up in the age of the Beach Boys, Jan and Dean, Frankie and Annette and Surf movies and the endless summer....I have skin cancers removed at least once per year.  They just continue to pop up everywhere...I knew it would never happen to me.....right!|`|QydVDaXRaa	The same reason people smoke:  for them, the benefits outweigh the risks.  It's also a factor that the risks are long-term and thus intangible, which for some makes them seem less serious.
l4DBJdJGaa	i guarantee you that if you walked up to a bunch of people wearing scarves like that if the were "expressing solidarity with Phalestine", 95% would have no idea what you're talking about. they'd probably say that it just looks really cute with their shag haircut and skinny jeans. <br>  <br>  like most religious garments or symbols that become fashion trends, the meaning is lost. same thing goes for kaballah red strings and the rosary.|`|JGMWR6wVaa	The scarf is worn for fashion.

Cv2h6n1Raa	That stuff might be a little to harsh. This is what I do, buy plain orange (non scented) liquid dial soap. When you are in the shower, right before you get out, put some in your hand and move the ring up and down. When you rinse it, move it up and down in the water until it is not very slippery. It is not a very harsh cleaning but it removes all the soap and stuff that gets in there that can cause irritation.|`|lygHp04Waa	use bactene to clean it daily, use a pointed cosmetic applicator q-tip and apply the cleanser to your navel area, slide the ring back and forth to let it get into your peircing and remove dirt/grime that causes infection and irritation; or another peircing cleanser and/or rubbing alcohol. if the infection comes back, go back on the medication and if it acts like it is not fully healed, continue the sea salt soaks, but you need to clean it a few times a day for about a year or so, especially if you're changing the ring often.

yyIVrngcaa	Step1<br>  Soften the hair to be removed by soaping up with body cleanser of choice, and rinsing well. It's best to do this in the shower, rather than while bathing, since submersion in water will eventually lead your skin to swell, and the shave won't be as close. If you have not shaved the area to be treated in a while, or ever, it is useful to gently exfoliate the area, either with a loofah or with a granular body scrub. Be sure to rinse away all the particles.<br>  Step2<br>  Apply a generous amount of shaving lotion, massaging all over area to be shaved. Begin shaving outermost hair first, shaving IN THE DIRECTION OF HAIR GROWTH. This means, in most cases, shaving toward your midline, rather than away (scooping under each hair). Use small gentle strokes to get ever closer to the midline of your body, stopping where ever you choose. Take time to rinse off the razor frequently.<br>  Step3<br>  When shaving is complete and you are done with the shower, dry the area gently by blotting and apply a thin layer of antiperspirant (NOT JUST DEODORANT). I have found that the aluminum salts in antiperspirant which decrease the sweating action also are great astringents and prevent oil production and inflammation, both of which lead to bumps.|`|BkUdgEXWaa	Coochy Cream I bought it at a brown bag party and it is amazing you can use it anywhere you shave: legs, underarms, EVERYWHERE!!

lU8e0VQFaa	It kind of depends on what condition your hair is in now and how strong it is generally. I dyed a friends hair a deep soft black and then used color zap (I think) to strip out parts of her hair that she wanted a blondish color. Worked really well except she didn't listen to me and didn't scrub hard enough so it re-darkened (if you do strip spend like an hour in the shower scrubbing the dye out). I gave her some really good deep conditioners to use and her hair looked great. And this was like the 6th processing in 3 months. Could be her hair is just really strong. A color stripper will only take your hair to the lightest color it's been so if you have to then bleach afterward that may cause quite a bit of damage. Either way, unless you really know what you're doing go see a pro.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	I would not recommend doing that ...I have and it completely fried my hair and I had to cut it to above my shoulders when it was half way down my back. <br>  I had jet black hair and waned it blonde , never got it blonde but I got brown , and short ....dont do it! <br>  Go to a salon and have them do a few color washes. It will strip all the color out but its not has harsh as the other method like bleach! <br>  Its called a color rinse/wash call local salons not everyone does it!

HVc8kBcvaa	Sally Hansen also makes airbrush foundation.  I've used both the legs and foundation products and I like them both.  I wouldn't recommend spraying the foundation directly on your face unless you completely cover your hair and keep your eyes shut and then blend well.  I do like the airbrush legs for my legs because it evens out the color and makes them look nice!  I do not know, however, how well it does in high humidity and against sweating.  I would suggest using the airbrush foundation for your decollete and arms instead of the airbrush legs (I think  it's cheaper, too) because it would easily blend from face to neck to decollete to arms. And both are definitely cheaper than the Dior foundation spray!  Tried that also but the counter lady didn't blend it well so I don't really have an unbiased opinion about that.  But I do love Sally Hansen.  Anyway, good luck and I hope I helped!|`|nhLakq35aa	I tried it last summer and I wasn't a fan. Although, I have really fair skin and I think it would work better on someone with a tan and only then it would just even it out I think. I don't think it's that great of a product and if you're really looking for something that's going to make your legs look tan than this isn't it. I would try a light powder with a shimmer instead of a foundation if you're trying to even out skin tone on your upper body. If you use a foundation on your chest and arms I think it would rub off on your clothes throughout the course of an evening out.

You can find jeans, office outfits, t-shirts, tops, boleros, dresses, classy pants, capris and whatever. I personally prefer Ross, Target and Old Navy (I'm a bigger size), plus I can accesorize my clothes with bags, jewleries and so on.|`|Nwm1JZNXaa	I'm going to be 24 actually in a few days and I shop at Target for their basic t-shirts and stuff, but I buy my jeans from american eagle or abercrombie and fitch.  Those jeans just fit my body right and I like the darker washes that they have.  You can also find some cute things at banana republic sometimes in their sale section.  Those clothes are pretty pricey when they're full price, but are great for career wear.  I can usually find some good deals in the sale area of that store.  Also check out Old Navy.  I like the shirts there too like basic long sleeve and short sleeve stuff for around $10.  I just got a nice black trench coat too for $50 there.  Good luck :)|`|XrcZkt6Haa	Ebay or amazon, check the most suitable styles and color that fit for you|`|AA12332075	joyce leslie, forever 21, h&m|`|f4ba47a2857db6a4c06027dd19f8455aaa	You'd be better off to buy a sewing machine, learn to sew, and buy some materials and patterns of your own mature choosing, if you want not to look like a "tween". Not to mention they could be fitted exactly to your body and you may save a lot of cash in these trying economic times. Maybe your sewing skills could be a lifelong supplemental income, too, if not a life's career. Perhaps you can make clothes for other little ladies in the same boat as you, too. Maybe even your own clothing line. There may very well be an untapped market of little women that are virtually neglected by the mainstream fashion world. That's what's called a specialty niche market. Fortunes are made in satisfying many people who have always been unhappy with what's being offered in our cookie-cutter world that we are all supposed to fit neatly into. Think seriously about what I've said.|`|YwM8Z14oaa	I like to shop at ROSS I don't know what your budget is , but they are fairly cheap. But one of My favorites, is Goodwill, or stores like that, you can find nice stuff for cheap, there used.. But you can find namebrand stuff, and some classy stuff for all sizes <br>  <br>  I know what tyou mean.. I am 20 years.. and a guy lol, but it is hard to find clothes that are Not for sanky guys, something along those lines.. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|GU325Ap1aa	The best thing you can do is to buy things you like even if they are a bit big for you and pay a bit extra to get them fix to fit you perfectly, this will not cost that much and you'll be able to dress as you like.|`|lVk3ZSnEaa	Thrift stores, seriously, you'd be surprised what you can find and if you decide you don't like it, you're not out too much money.  We went shopping and i got like 5 dresses for 10 dollars.  It was so much fun!|`|o9GNDREIaa	TJ Maxx.

k0BF9M0Haa	Play around with the little things first, like hair and makeup. Then once you're starting to like how you look then you can start to buy small things like accesories and undergarments.<br>  <br>  Go online or go people watching to see what kind of style is in and decide for yourself what you really like. After you do that, you should be able to have some confidence to do some major shopping!<br>  <br>  Most of all, Don't worry about what other people think! Just as long as your pretty confident in the skin that you're in and feel beautiful you most likely are.<br>  <br>  Anywho, hope this helped and best of luck with ya!|`|0uSPPAb5aa	If you are comfortable with yourself you should be confident in what you do. Other wise maybe you should rethink doing it in the first place.|`|zQiYKgMLaa	Yep:  Don't Crossdress.  You're already not comfortable or confident in it.  Why are you doing it?|`|C0pk4kgJaa	First of all before you get into the clothes I think you should start with your hair and makeup, because those really do boost your confidence. Search up some styles online. Don't be afraid to dress nice, turn heads!!

CNKBGVgQaa	It all depends on what straightener you are using. I have two, a normal dry hair straightener, then one from like walmart called Wet to Dry. You set the temperature to how wet your hair is, and it dries and straightens at the same time. It also works great on all dry hair! :] It's amazing...just read all the good reviews! Plus, its only $25! :]<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=5855128" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a>|`|l6s1DMB6aa	Yes!  It's fine with the proper styling tools - i'd suggest you read more on HerStyler all natural hair care products and natural 100% ceramic/tourmaline irons (the wet to dry iron might be the right one for you.....you can straighten your hair without blowdrying, you can find this straightener under 'hair straighteners' on the web-store).  In either case these products will not damage your hair - they are fantasitc and you can find them at <a href="https://www.infashionsense.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.infashionsense.com</a>|`|qV70OQ91aa	I wouldn't do that....i try to avoid straightening whenever i can because it damages the hair...try putting on a heat protection serum before straightening!<br>  <br>  answer mine? <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqzZJxz5ZqluoLjM3YW2DxLsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304081842AAVCqsk">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|jKLvQkNwaa	NO!  Don't do it!!!  I was told before that you can get really straight hair by straightening it when it is damp.  BAD IDEA!!!  For one, it doesn't work.  For another, it will ruin your hair!  It will kill it!  Just stick to regular straightening, please!|`|GqPnK0OBaa	no!!! dont ever striaghten wet hair. you're not even supposed to come wet hair...you can blow dry then straighten...(straightening can make hair dry though|`|opQbQVreaa	No, it can fry your hair|`|pksLpEvPaa	no u will totally burn it...|`|pS02JGTUaa	nope, it completely fries it and will give you split ends quickly. /:|`|qQqC2cHIaa	No.  Don't use a heated straightener on wet hair.  Wet hair is more fragile that dry hair and it's easier to damage the hair.  Let your hair dry, spritz with a heat protection spray and then use the heated straightener.  It's okay to use a straight paddle brush while blow-drying hair, that's not direct heat on the hair.|`|qNOeBcvraa	ummm negative!!!!!! it pretty uch frys it to dry it and straighten it. you should always dry it first. even if you hair is in perfect shape you will see the damage shortly if you continue that|`|7lQylFnyaa	No it messes up your hair majorly. Only straighten dry hair with a heat protector spray on.|`|uufMl9xkaa	NO! it will fry ur hair.<br>  u can get a special kind of straightener 4rm like wal mart or anywhere thats made 2 dry and straighten ur hair at the same time.|`|5jsMY4RIaa	No, your hair will turn into straw. Wait until it is completely dry before you straighten it.

CkIeCNS4aa	What material are they?  Patent, leather, satin?  The material will affect what embellishments and adhesive you can use.  I would suggest tiny ribbon bows, gems, beads, et cetera.  There is an adhesive called Gem-tac that you might be able to find at a craft store.  They won't look tacky as long as you don't go overboard.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.artbeads.com/gemtac.html?zmam=24751123&zmas=1&zmac=1&zmap=GEMTAC&CJPID=1609763" rel="nofollow">http://www.artbeads.com/gemtac.html?zmam...</a><br>  <br>  EDIT: I had some ideas over the course of the day.  You could put tiny clear rhinestones covering the heel and put a tiny bow on the toe.  You could outline the opening for the foot with little pieces of ribbon and a bow as if it were woven through the shoe.  You could do diagonal rhinestone stripes across the toe.  If the toe is pointed or kind of elongated and squared off, you could just cover an inch of it in rhinestones.  If the toe is round you could make designs with the rhinestones on the toe such as hearts, stars, your initials, et cetera.  You could also use those sticky rhinestone sets they have for cell phones.|`|yhsT1weJaa	if you do it yourself, it will look tacky! dont do it!<br>  Keep them the same, or buy some diffrent ones, dont change them!!! (:   it will look MEGA tacky (:

XqzPkogaaa	It came out grey because you just put blonde hair dye over brown hair.<br>  You have to bleach your hair for it to show up right.<br>  I would recommend mixing some regular clorox bleach and comet power bleach with some conditioner and washing your hair with it.<br>  I would put a little bit more bleach that comet and not that much conditioner so it works faster.<br>  Then you can buy your hair dye and dye it yourself and it should come out right<br>  [;|`|5p7cQAokaa	Going from a blonde to brunette is easy.  It's going from a brunette to blonde that's hard, because you literally have to BLEACH your hair.  My recommendation is to go to Hot Topic and get their bleach, it's called white out.  It doesn't actually make your hair WHITE but it does bleach it pretty well.  It comes with a toner and something else, that helps to soften your hair.  Then buy a box of dye (blonde) and dye it.  It should come out more accurately.

Pn9tPYKbaa	well i think your are pretty, but try not to use liqued foundation. bad bad bad, makes skin look fake. umm do you put ur eyeline on ur bottem eye over the eyelash line or under? if over, DONT DO THAT!! it make people look trashy, and eyes small. yeh some people look fine with it, but most dont.try a clear lipgloss. or maybe a nice lip balm. and also trim the eyebrows. they can make or break a face. so i would pluck them a bt. my eyebrows used to be reeeel think and bushy, and i plucked them, and my eyes looked bigger, my face looked thinner, and my face looked brighter:) well i hope you have fun with your make-up stuff:)|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	The first Maybelline site tells you what colors of eye shadow to wear.<br>  <br>  The second one is for lip gloss in the colors you should wear based on your skin tone and eye color. <br>  <br>  There is a video that shows one way to apply eye makeup.|`|uufMl9xkaa	we'll u dont need much more cuz you've got natural beauty. :D<br>  but u should definitely wear a light eyeshadow and some eyeliner with<br>  a light blush and some lipgloss.|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	I don't mean this harshly, but I would suggest you get your eyebrows plucked.|`|05daceaaa082bb305c111d460191a776aa	Since you're 13, I would suggest that 'less is more'. You have really nice skin, kind of translucent. I do not think you need more than what you have already said. An eye liner and an eye pencil, with a mascara should be enough. Avoid black mascara though, it gives a harsh look to your eyes. For the lips, just go with a light colored lipstick or gloss..And you're good to go!|`|CNKBGVgQaa	Heyy im 13 and I diffidently think you should incorporate more color into your makeup. It will make your face look brighter and happier. :] AVON is the best place to get makeup...you can pick your own colors and it is pretty cheap! Hope I helped! :]|`|lVk3ZSnEaa	I think you could use a little more color on your lips.  There is some lip balm, like moisturizer for the lips, that has a little color in it, not too much, but just to make your lips stand out a bit more.|`|pksLpEvPaa	i think  u are fine the way u are...n ur too young for make up...u dont need any honey...|`|spo9KBRpaa	maybe some coloured eye shadow?<br>  or lipgloss?<br>  or some blusher?<br>  <br>  just experiement with make up..... so you know what suits you..<br>  dont be afraid to test any colours and stuff...<br>  <br>  oh and maybe you could do something with your hair?<br>  like curl it maybe? x|`|az0Z0DIjaa	Umm...If you're only 13, those three things should be good for now. Remember you can always change up the colors of the mascara and eyeliner. I think cuz you have dark eyes, amethyst eyeliner would look really pretty :)

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	If you want to run out and pick up some products locally, I recommend trying the following:<br>  - Drugstore: L'oreal out of bed weightless texturizer (black tub, use under gel), LA Looks or Herbal essences gels, Suave naturals or vo5 conditioners, L'oreal vive pro hydra gloss or nutri gloss for curly hair, red Cream of Nature shampoo<br>  - Organic/specialty store (like whole foods): Giovanni Direct Leave in condish, G conditioners, G tea tree shampoo, Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose or White Camellia Conditioners, AO B-5 Design gel<br>  - ULTA: Devacurl products, Biosilk rock hard gelee, MOP-c curl defining cream (They also carry drugstore products and giovanni.)<br>  <br>  These are all good things I have used, but be sure to tinker around with amounts and how you use any products. For hair type specific products check out these forums:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/</a><br>  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. However, the most popular ones are usually only available online.<br>  <br>  Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:<br>  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons</a><br>  *Don't shampoo every day.<br>  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.<br>  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.<br>  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Don’t know yours? <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types</a><br>  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.<br>  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.<br>  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while it’s drying.<br>  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.<br>  <br>  Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) It’s pretty radical—no sulfates (shampoo) or silicones—but it’s so great for curly hair. Give it a shot and check it out:<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-Girl-Method-for-Curly-Hair" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/</a> (outdated product recs!)<br>  <br>  Some other great curly care sites: <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl</a><br>  <a href="http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm" rel="nofollow">http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm</a>|`|xkSuKSn8aa	Use good shampoo and conditioner to begin with, that is designed for curly hair. My husband uses Matrix. He has curly hair down to the middle of his back. <br>  Only put conditioner on the hair past your eye level to keep roots from getting oily.<br>  Try coconut oil,VERY sparingly, to scrunch your curls. Too much and you will have a greasy mess.<br>  Matrix curl.life Curl Milk is really good too, and probably easier to find.|`|l6s1DMB6aa	Yes!  It sounds like you don't want to wash it daily because you are afraid of damaging it?  I'd use proper natural hair care that will allow you to wash it daily without damaging it and repairs any dry, damaged or frizzy hair, therefore will enhance your natural curl and wave and make it healthy.  You can read more on HerStyler hair care products at <a href="https://www.infashionsense.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.infashionsense.com</a> - these products really do give you amazing results that you will notice right from the first use and they are economical because you only use a tiny amount.  It took me 42 years of crummy hair and trying every drugstore brand, cheap and expensive to find this fantastic solution - i hope this helps - best of luck!|`|QjjStYhKaa	you sound like you have hair like my best friend<br>  i knpw that she washes her hair, then puts it into two french plaits and lets it dry (overnight)  then in the morning, she takes it out and she has lush curls  <br>  i know this works well for her so hopefully it will for you too :)

zhzJoZ26aa	MAC did have a brush set, in the set game 4 usable brushes, I don't remember the numbers 100% but I know it was the 187 and the angled brush and a tapered crease brush and a concealer brush. The set was sold about a year about for 130$ but they we're LE. They came with a really cute case too. But if you have a local CCO they might have it. I've seen quite a few people get it from there I saw one there don't kill me if I'm wrong but it was 80$ odd dollars. For 4 brushes and a case. That's a steal. The 187 almost is almost 50$<br>  <br>  The brush set cindy is talking about is the holiday brush sets, they're factory made so they're not as good as the real ones. Real ones are hand made.

PwxmrBm9aa	Do you chemically treat or often use heat on your hair? If so that might be a reason why your hair appears to have not grown. The ends will be dry and split which results in them breaking off, so even if you haven't had your hair cut in ages, the ends of your hair are still coming off. <br>  If you are certain your hair is in good condition then maybe consider taking some supplements that people claim have helped their hair grow such as Biotin & MSM which you can find in health food stores.<br>  <br>  I have a blog which has lots of tips on growing and maintaining healthy hair - <a href="http://thelonghairdiaries.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://thelonghairdiaries.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Massaging makes a lot of difference to the rate at which hair grows, so a regular massage  with any oil of your choice is recommended to speed up the process.

xc8bnpCvaa	I agree with him  on the symmetry, but not on the owning two. Maybe he is just using that argument to get another gun (lol)<br>  I'd tell him two of the same gun is a waste and no one but you guys has to know he doesn't have 2!<br>  In reality, most people have stuff tattooed on them they have never even seen, much less owned! So, save the money for the tat,...put the 2nd gun off...|`|v4f1oqOCaa	he should have it balanced out with something other than a copy of the same gun.  im sure there is something else that he is proud of, perhaps his car or a pet or loved one.<br>    it could be incorporated into a nice mural.<br>  <br>  <br>  i think personally a great idea is to have it tattooed on the side by the ribs where you would have it if it were in a holster :)|`|eGMe5qknaa	It's funny, my husband and I are big into symmetry too. A very common tattoo is two revolvers. I personally don't see anything wrong with getting two for symmetry. I think you should help him focus on the piece of art he is putting on his body and making it look the way he wants. I hope this helps!|`|1Ad7jJgwaa	Have him get one that's black and another that's white, sort of like Ebony and Ivory. I tried to find the biblical/historical relevance, but couldn't. For the most part, it's black and white, good and evil. That's symmetry at it's best imo.<br>  <br>  Not sure how it's look, but you could always make the other gun on it's opposite to make it somewhat circular, and then it'd look sort of like Yin and Yang, but you'd have to be very artistic to make that work and appreciate it.<br>  <br>  One would be tilted facing upwards, the barrel on the bottom, and the other would be tilted facing downwards as a mirror image, barrel on the topside.|`|7Rd2SYdtaa	Well if you're short on cash, you wouldn't want to get both of them<br>  <br>  just get one and later on get another.|`|f6f47d2d4a1dd864d0dc1916b2be4925aa	tell your fiancée to save up more money if he wants two gun's in the tattoo|`|LeHpIFwyaa	He should have a good artist draw up a few pics for the tattoo...explain the problem and ask if he can balance the image without having two of the same gun and using another item your husband finds symbolic.  Or if he does plan on buying a second gun and knows exactly what type and all he will get then just bring a pic of the second gun in and have it included in the tatt then it is there and he has the time to save for the second gun, and the tatt he wants.  Chess pieces usually are not balanced and a good artist can make an image appear balanced with out all the duplicity.  In fact sometimes the dual effect makes the image seem unbalanced.  <br>  <br>  The best thing would be to have the artist draw several ideas out and explore that option before just purchasing a gun because you have a tatt of one.  Guns should be treated with respect and not just bought on a whim of fancy.<br>  <br>  May you be blessed.|`|RLoBuvZnaa	Chest pieces should, as a rule, be as symmetrical as possible.  It would be hard to achieve a symmetrical look wih only one gun.<br>  <br>  He has several options...<br>  <br>  1)  Get 2 guns.<br>  2)  Do a different piece and put the gun somewhere else.<br>  3)  Do a different piece, no gun.<br>  4)  Get rid of the gun so you don't have to get it tattooed.<br>  <br>  There are ways to do a one gun chest piece, but it all depends on what you boyfriend is looking for.  I would put a hand holding the gun and have that as the center piece, and make the background symmetrical.|`|bj1qKTYuaa	at the end of the day its going to look better as a tattoo if its symmetrical, tattoos on chests always look better like that....if your not going to work with symmetry then it takes some cleaver planning to balance a chest piece out <br>  <br>  it doesn't matter too much that he only owns one of the guns i don't think! it would be like having angel wings tattooed on your back or whatever and only having the one because its the same wing, it would look daft!<br>  <br>  if hes still undecided he should go talk to a good tattooist! i wouldn't recommend the idea of getting one done now and one later, i would either get both done together or re-plan the whole design, he could always make the gun the center of the piece and use symmetry to balance out whatever he places either side|`|c4sn6g3xaa	Support him in getting what he wants, I'm sure if you wanted it, he would support you.  If he is anything like my husband, he will end-up getting what he wants anyways, so go with it.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	Just get it so the guns look like mirror images. And it doesn't really matter if he owns it or not, no one has to know
essd1DYWaa	It depends what you switch to. Be careful not to use anything clarifying. I would try one of the color shampoos by John Frieda to be on the safe side.|`|IIztioS3aa	the color should only fade to a certain extent. if its already been 2 and a half months or so then it probably won't fade anymore (or noticeably at this point). if you like the color and you don't have a problem with roots, then don't color it again until you either don't like the shade it turned or you need to touch up the roots. its actually healthier for your hair this way.<br>  <br>  i've gone 4 months or without changing colors before i noticed a lot of roots. it depends on how often your getting your hair trimmed and also how close to your natural color the new one is. i'm sure there are other things that affect your hair growth but those are the big ones.<br>  <br>  i had recently dyed my hair and 3 weeks later it needed it again. the color was so faded and there was a good inch of regrowth. i was amazed!|`|DilBAALxaa	if its already faded then it wont fade anymore if you stop using the colour protection products|`|9jws9M8Vaa	no it doesn't,<br>  it just keeps it healthy, and keeps a shine to it.<br>  it just helps it stay strong, and not turn 'strawish'<br>  so, no - it wont fade.

Make everything upmarket and professional looking and you will be unlikely to attract the undesirables you speak of.<br>  <br>  You may like to have a polite sign written up to go on the treatment room wall that says something along the lines of<br>  <br>  "This is a professional establishment, we hope you enjoy and benefit from your treatment. Our staff are proffessionally qualified in their field and have the right to work with out harrassment, we reserve the right to refuse service in these circumstances".|`|49q6Rxa6aa	Laugh and say, "You only get a massage."|`|nXSpS3Axaa	go with the flow, I suppose..|`|AA11352641	If you present yourself as a reputatable business with trained and licensed personnel, I think those requests are few and far between.

qQqC2cHIaa	It's quite common.  Shoes aren't really made to rigid standards, one company's size eight can fit like another's size eight and a half.  Charts are mnerely guidlines to help you find your closest size, everyone has variations in their foot structure that will affect the final fit. Foot widths vary and aren't always taken into account in shoe charts so many will need a larger size for the width, like my hubby.  Buy what fits you and feels good on your foot. Don't get hung up what size a chart says you should be.|`|62oLK3wsaa	yes|`|hyaQrCjmaa	i have to get a half size bigger shoe for my son because the top of his foot, you know, that little hump?... it's kinda high so shoes that are actually his size are too tight.

EaSEjCMZaa	You could try getting it pierced with a small bar instead of a hoop because the main reason why they have you take out all jewelry is so nothing gets snagged onto it and cause any problems or accidents.

sV0DUJD3aa	Well you have to ask yourself - are you condfident enough to pull it off? do you look nice in the dress? Cause if you feel out of place then you'll look out of place. If the dress is really nice and you're a confident person then go for it and you'll look amazing in it. But if you feel like a loser in it, it will ruin the night - trust me.

So I knew getting my tattoo there would be a piece of cake too.. AND IT WAS!  I have a high pain tolerance. The one over my shoulder was easy too.

GrWpYMrnaa	Well this was literally the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me.<br>  <br>  When I was fifteen one night I was having a sleep over at my best friends place and another one of my friends was there with us. We were just hanging out having fun, and for some reason we began playing this ultimate game of truth or dare, where basically it was all dares to do stupid things and non of us were backing down. Anyways while we were playing were wandering around his house and ended up in his older sisters room. His older sister was 20 at the time, but she was ridiculously hot and whenever I was there I loved trying to flirt with her even though it would never happen. So while we were in there my other friend who was there opens the top drawer and pulls out this really skimpy green thong and because it was my turn he says "I dare you to try on this thong". I looked at my friend and he didnt seem to care, so I thought I would do it just for shits and giggles and because I wasnt going to loose. So I grabbed it and went into the washroom, and quickly slid my pyjama pants and boxers off and slowly put it on and ajusted everything. It was like neon green and kinda frilly and barely fit but for fun I put my pants back on over top and walked out to proove that I did it, They didnt believe me so I had to walk up and show them and just then as I was proving I had it on the door flies open and his mom walks in and is looking at me face to face and says "what are you boys doing in here?" and as I was standing there my friend pantses me infront of his own mom while I was wearing this green thong. I pulled up my pants while my friends were laughing histarically at me and his mom was just looking at starring at me and then joined in and laughed a bit and said "wow Sean nice panties" and then just left the room. My friends never got over that and always bring it up infront of his mom and itd the most embarrassing thing. In a way im lucky his Mom didnt freak out but now I can never talk to her again and I guess in a way it was karma for me wearing someone elses underwear. But it was still the worste thing ever|`|6H4f8P68aa	Don't worry about it he probably though you were hot.<br>  <br>  Anyway my friend alex had got pantsed this boy in school had snuck up behind him and pulled his shorts down it was hilarious.<br>  <br>  One time I was at my grandparents house and They told a really funny joke and I laughed so hard i started farting and then suddenly I feel something wet in my panties and I found out I pooped in my pants I was so embarassed. I got over it I was in the first grade now Im in the sixth grade.<br>  <br>  True stories|`|N48qV69daa	ohhh yea! Tons of them. One time we had a litter of puppies and this couple came to see them and were sitting in our front room. I had these really silky baggy pajama pants on, and as I walked past this couple, I stepped on the bottom of my pants, and tripped, but when I stepped on the bottom of my pants, they fell off! I was wearing a tiny g string. I was so embarassed. <br>  One time my fiance and I had to go to the laundry mat because our washer broke. It was so packed in there, with mostly men. My load was in the dryer, and was done drying, and I just knew once I opened the door one of my thongs would fly out. Sure enough, my fiance opened the door, and it came flying out! I was like bright red. Luckily my fiance picked it up before any more than 4 or 5 guys seen.<br>  <br>  Heres an embarassing story I know you will love.<br>  One time all of my guy friends, a close girly friend, and my self went swimming. I just bought this new bikini, it was so cute! We all were diving off the side at the same time, but when I dived I some how landed and a back flop. I guess the impact was so hard that it ripped the bottoms of my swimsuit, so if I stood up, everyone could see my whole entire butt! Luckily, my fiance and friends grabbed a towel, as they were laughing hysterically, and held it up so no one could see my butt and followed me to the locker room. I cried, haha and my fiance and his and our friends laughed so hard they cried. <br>  <br>  <br>  One time, I was wearing this really cute plaid skirt to school when I was in highschool. I used the rest room, and some how failed to notice my skirt was tucked into my underwear. Bright pink mesh thong. Luckily, a close friend of mine and my fiances came running behind me as soon as I left the restrooms and he pulled my skirt out. I am still teased about this to this day.|`|b44977868e59145cac885c679e938af9aa	Dont be embarrassed about that. I am sure the guy was absolutely thrilled and more than likely turned on at the site of your hot undies.<br>  <br>  But here is my story. I went to camp when I was in the 6th grade. I didnt get pantsed or anything. But I did forget to pack any underwear at all. My brothers and sister and even my mother teased me about it when I got home because it was the only thing left in my dresser drawers back home.|`|W76VDFKCaa	Yeah, I have 2.<br>  1. I lived next door to my best friend and she came over to borrow some laundry detergent.  Since my dirty laundry was sitting by the door, she said that she would wash them for me.  I was busy at work and didn't get to pick up my clothes for a few days.  During the 2 days the clothes were at her apartment, her boyfriend saw my red thongs (good thing they were clean!) and picked them up. He was looking at them and said, 'These are sexy, how come I have never seen these on you?"  All my best friend could do is laugh.  Then he looked down and saw my daughters clothes and realized that they weren't for my friend. It's kinda embarrassing having your best friends boyfriend playing with your thongs.<br>  <br>  2.  One day when I was at the laundrymat folding my clothes, my daughter (not even 2 at the time) was helping me fold the little towels.  When I looked up, she was putting my thongs around her neck, on display of everyone to see.

Just imagine the flat chested girl thinking about your problem at Hollister, she probably would trade places with you so she could be more appealing to guys.  I think that they should offer larger sizes at these stores but they base their size scales on the majority of the men and women that shop there.  Be grateful for the big boobs!!!|`|JGMWR6wVaa	I'd have to say that I have the same issues but I just don't bother to shop there.

aKCoaQpcaa	i have the same problem. wen i put my hair down it tends to frizz out. so usually put it up. but my favorite style is called a bump and a bun its so cute. i wearing it now. but heres how u do it... first you flat iron a bump and make the bump. the with the rest of your hair you make a messy bun towards the top of your head. but not that high... it is so cute on me. i love it. oh and congrats to ur marrige. i no your probably happy : )

You could always try something new before you go - a new hairstyle/colour or a new dress style. Just make sure you look good, and smile! Good luck|`|sV0DUJD3aa	I know everyone's saying that you shouldnt want to be popular but thats not answering your question so ill tell you what the popular people at my school are like:<br>  <br>  good at sport, happy, smiley, pretty, clever, flirt with boys, outgoing<br>  <br>  to be popular you just need to hit it off with the 'in' crowd. But I'll warn you it's not all it's cracked up to be. Sometimes its better to be in a crowd you feel comfortable around instead of a crowd you're trying to impress.<br>  <br>  In most cases though you're either popular or you're not. If you're not very popular at one school chances are you're not going to be in another school. The less you try the better though.|`|JbSebJJYaa	Be yourself, really.

JbSebJJYaa	I've actually seen it a lot. It has to do with the different pigment and melanin in the hair. There is nothing wrong with it<br>  <br>  - Paul Mitchell Salon Professional|`|FQeSo65Haa	My friend is of mixed European ancestry, and her hair is blonde and brown . Like, some locks of hair are blonde and some are brown. It looks like she dyed it but she swears she didn't. I don't know...|`|iYL37RfPaa	Yes, my step brother has like a mousy hair colour,<br>  and his beard is ginger (not bright ginger), so that looks really odd<br>  <br>  and my brother hair is dark brown, and has a blonde beard!!<br>  <br>  xo|`|hUYaaXBvaa	yes<br>  my dad has dark brown hair and a red beard<br>  and hes italian and german<br>  i have some italian cousins with pure red hair, not even irish so maybe its both sides for your brother|`|aZXnW6AUaa	yes
l6yn08LNaa	Well I have been dyeing hair for 5 years.And you have to bleach it first.Because your hair is to dark.You cant just have dark hair and trow some blonde dye into it it wont turn out.But I think bleaching it will kill it badly.I think you sould leave your hair alone.When I was 13 my sister wanted me to dye her hair her hair she had dark brown hair she wanted it blonde and i did it for her.It turned out bad there were blonde then brown blotchs all over here head..Then we went to the salon to get it fixed they said her hair color was to hard to find so they dyed it light brown and it looked very bad cause puting that in your hair is killing it.and when your hair is fryed like that you cant straighten it or nothing and why would you want to be a blonde dark heads are way better besides haf the blondes in the world arent real ones.and wouldnt you want to be nauterl i mean put some blonde streaks in it just dont go fak and dead.then your hair will look like crap.|`|XMJJiD0qaa	Bleach lightly and then use streaks of black or grey!|`|rg2xnDUpaa	na naaa your krazy.<br>  go to ILLUSIONES hair salon on Washington St. in Wuakegan IL.<br>  they hook u up there.<br>  theyl make ur hair look like cinderellas<br>  .<br>  trust me my ma' works there.|`|AA11436717	let me guess your 52 TIME DYING YOUR HAIR!! LOL<br>  <br>  STEPHANIE!! YOUR HAIR IS GOING TO FALL OUT WHEN UR 30 LOL JK|`|AA10613962	Yes, but if your hair is really dark, you will have a hard time getting the red out. I have dark brown natural hair with lots of red undertones(darned Irish side). Getting it down to the level where it will take the ash color is hard and tends to damage hair. There is also the problem with brassy tones that are horrible to dye out. If your hair is really dark, you may want to consider having it done by a professional. I know that it is necessary to use bleach to remove the natural color of my hair. Then you should apply the dye. I hope this helps!

u53ISZoXaa	Yes, the tounge is technacally considered a facial peircing.  There are so many ways to get yours ears pireced it's rediculous.  Also you can technically peirce ANYWHERE on your body. With micro dermals, which are placed under the skin then a small bead or jewwel is screwed onto the top of it.  Some of the traditional body peircings are the nipples, the naval, and several types of genital peircings with the clitoral hood being the most popular.  I've seen people with buttcrack peircings, and clevage peircings.  The webbing on your hand inbetween your thumb and pointer finger. You can get your chest or clavicals peirced, micro dermals on the back of the neck are popular, as are micro dermals around the naval area.  Like I said you can pierce anything!

But a snug BCR/CBR would look pretty IMO|`|IsQckOXraa	It looks nice with your whole style, <br>  but i would just get a different color maybe.<br>  btw, that picture isn't horrible, you look very nice in it!|`|B3cPFhssaa	Keep it,looks cute on you.<br>  <br>  & i spy a Kill Hannah poster,have the same one (:|`|IR0muDnHaa	Take it out. Now.<br>  You're really quite pretty and the piercing just ruins it...im sorry :(|`|dfQU2Copaa	I think it's hot......you should keep it..........|`|eN5xA6RKaa	i think it looks good. i would say to keep it.|`|ivjHOJ8daa	I love that peircing!<br>  So cool.<br>  Why take it out?|`|rPFfDR7Laa	it's cute! it depends on why you are considering taking it out.  if it's causing discomfort, then you should listen to your body and take it out.  if it's because you don't feel like it's very "you" or friends are criticizing you, then i say keep it.  you can pull off anything with confidence.|`|yhsT1weJaa	ew ew ew ew ew !!! take that out !! ew ew ew ew ew !!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  btw, your stunning! but that 'thing' reks it ALL!<br>  <br>  please dont listen to anyone who says it looks nice, cause it REALLY DOES NOT! it rewens your whole appernence! Your so pretty, but then you have that ugly pericing hanging out of your nose! GET RID OF IT!|`|62pCvaXGaa	Keep it if you like it, but if its bothering you take it out! I had my nose ring in for a long time but I decided it was time to move on in the end. Upto you.<br>  <br>  <br>  I like the getting a chunky one idea. Deffo get a bigger one! Looks silly.|`|L9WeTmzuaa	i think it looks good. if you are worried about a job or something you could just flip it up to hide it. but other than that...you're really pretty and it looks cute! :)|`|tjRuKlJaaa	keep it in! don't listen to what any one says about it looking bad. it is soo cute. i want one myself but i am only 14.|`|nuc5DBD8aa	Personally i don't like septum piercings. But you don't look horrible at all!|`|Xcs1USwvaa	its horrible. dont be goth and youll look better lol get it on you belly button.|`|wcDS1Libaa	take it out in my oppinion it reminds me of a bull<br>  but if you like it keep it in forget about what other people think x|`|JyPctBfAaa	you should keep it .<br>  it looks lovely on you.<br>  :)<br>  suits you nicely.<br>  i have mine too.<br>  looks better on ya:)|`|hZcqEmbAaa	Keep it!<br>  It looks fab!

Really its what you think and how you feel about it. Don't let someone tell you what to do with your body.|`|RdWTvI2raa	Looking at your pics I think you look nicer without the piercing.  But it's your body so the choice is up to you.  Why not take it out for a day or to and see you feel before making a final choice.|`|mCWqdbfYaa	it looks fine and you should keep it in unless it is infected than i would suggest either make sure you take care of it properly or take it out|`|GJwBDD1Daa	I say keep it. It suits you, however, get a chunkier ring, it's abit small and makes your nose look bigger than it really is ^^|`|dnWN6esaaa	personally i would take it out !<br>  <br>  your soo pretty but that ring just draws alot of attention to your nose and not your beauty
elL2ykyeaa	I've used the Ojon Dry Shampoo and while I love it, the nozzle clogs half way through on a lot of the cans.  My sister has had the same problem and the sales girl at Sephora told me that it is common with dry shampoos that are in the spray form.  It is too expensive to only be able to use half a can so I haven't bought any since.  I did buy the Oscar Blandi Pronto Dry Shampoo in the powder form and I really like it and the clean scent it has.  I used to use baby powder as well and this seems to work better for me.  I have dark blonde hair with light highlights but I know of darker haired people using it as well and it doesn't leave their hair white like baby powder.  You can get the small container/bottle for $10 at Ulta or Sephora and it lasts a lot longer than the spray.|`|hpTstbRraa	washing your hair everyday is not going to hurt your hair and if you do this the powder is not needed especially in thin hair it usually takes a few days for it to look oily unless you don't rinse well enough|`|JbSebJJYaa	Bumble and Bumble! Most amazing powder ever. It comes in different shades !<br>  <br>  - Paul Mitchell Salon Professional|`|UghRUnXDaa	dry shampoo!<br>  the tropical one from baltise is the best<br>  just spray some on ur hair then brush it out and voila :)<br>  trust me it saves the day when ur running late
noqcARv4aa	You should definitely leave your hair as it is. I would love to have it! The colour is beautiful and you're lucky to have it that way. I wish I could achieve your colour without having to use tons of products...not fair!<br>  I think it looks great when it's straight, but it's probably better overall to keep your hair natural because it looks lovely in natural curls, and you won't have to damage your hair with lots of heat, which is a bonus!<br>  <br>  Kate L, whoever she is, is being a bit of a cow, really. She's probably just jealous; you can totally rock vintage looks and, besides, I don't think Kate L really has the right to criticize you when she clearly has her own issues. Your style is not dated, it's really nice. I don't see why so many girls feel the need to be bitchy about people just to cover up their own insecurities/jealousy...what's wrong with complimenting people and having people actually like you? I admire your style choices and you seem to have a down to earth personality; you seem real. Rock on.|`|pS02JGTUaa	i love your style, you're beautiful!<br>  <br>  i would maybe just go a shade lighter.<br>  maybe a demi-perminenet color at first and if you like it go completely permanent.<br>  good luck!|`|j3DqJ2BBaa	yh keep it the same no need to dye it it looks fine|`|gZlRnTISaa	stick with natural colour, I think if grown it could be quite cool and give you a few more options. At the mo I am liking it wavy - the poker straight look is still about but volume and natural shine are the key looks for the moment... <br>  <br>  You have an interesting look - keep it up :D|`|zon13nY2aa	I really like your hair colour as it is now. It looks shiny and healthy, and it suits you. I like it better wavy. And I think you could get away with having it wavier/messy!<br>  <br>  Love all your clothes btw. x|`|EKesa3cbaa	Personally i think you look lovely and i like it natual and straight but you could always try some other hairstyles/colors on at:<br>  www.instyle.com<br>  ??I really hope helped!!??|`|sKCxxdNBaa	it will be pretty if you put sum blane in your hair but  live sum brand in to it you known "|`|PjxamRdVaa	I like it when it is curly & I like it the color it is. I think you look cute. :) But if you are going to then don't go too light because you have dark eyebrows and it'll look tacky unless you are going to color them too.|`|255PsFdIaa	I personal would keep my hair the same color. Im a blonde but I wanna dye my hair to look like Kristen Stewart's. Because I look a lot like her! but you have a very pretty color and I wouldn't change it. I agree with you on the wavy/curly look. It fits|`|9b46IoAFaa	You and your friends all have the nicest clothes and you're all very pretty! :) Yeah i think that would look great on you cos you've got the sort of complexion which goes with anything! But you should probably go to the hairdressers and do it, just to be safe! x|`|oVOaaEJnaa	It's a gorgeous colour already so your friends are right. Curly looks better but straight looks nice too if you want a change now and then. If you really want to dye it then get a few highlights but don't get rid of your colour it's lovely!|`|KGAfoVzcaa	Do what is called A RINSE so that you can see what it looks like, and if you like it, do the dye, if not, then no harm no foul!|`|YM6XnDSBaa	sorriie i have to say it...your fashion sense is amazing special top right pic!...yh go lighter layered and defo straight..hope that helped x|`|zfiiC5JZaa	I think you should leave it.  Your hair really compliments your eyes and that looks lovely <3|`|bQTFX54waa	Yea just keep it like that<br>  It looks fine|`|v87U9Yqkaa	i understand what you mean by you want to experiment with your hair because i was in the same position and now it was the worst choice of my life because i have to grow the colour out and i cant wear my hair down. but that's just my opinion. i think your natural hair colour is really nice and i think it looks better naturally curly.<br>  hope this helps.|`|cRoIhjNzaa	I think natural is the way to go!!! Don't dye your hair it looks great that color and curly.  I dyed my hair a few times and I regret it.  I actually damaged my hair with the dying and straightening.  Now to get my hair back to its natural color and curls its gonna take a while until the dye grows out and curls come back. Hope that helps.|`|uxLdK7yiaa	I actually really like your hair. With the natural color and the natural texture it's really cute. I'd keep it...but if you want to change it get some highlights or something. <br>  Also I think that you would look wicked cute with like a dark blonde color. I think you could work it, you're really pretty.<br>  Good luckkk<3|`|vxeMXIAtaa	your gorgeous! and i loveee your style. i think your hair colour suits you well but if you wanted to go lighter it would probably work too. in my opinion, you hair colour works well with your style so i'd say leave it. plus constantly dying your hair is a drag.|`|u8oaTcGeaa	your hair color is really pretty.<br>  but if your looking for a new color may i suggest a dirty blonde to a dark blonde color.<br>  that will really bring out your eyes and it will look very good with your skin tone.|`|xck7VmVeaa	I think you should keep it the way it is! It looks great, but if you are going to dye it you shouldn't go to light. It will look fake|`|HkpG1IJkaa	No you shouldn't dye your hair because it looks really nice the colour you have now so dont change it.|`|L5rcEqFzaa	Keep it how it is
rFMRgHTdaa	If you weren't made in brazil it would be a bad idea i think. Ask your mom and dad if they conceived you in brazil if the answer is yes then it will go perfect with you if not then i would lean towards a different idea.|`|H9Bzw0VNaa	I'm gonna give you my honest opinion... <br>  I'm Brazilian but I live in the US.  I know about 4 Brazilian girls here that have that exact tattoo... Most have it on the back of their neck, or on their hip.. Gisele also has that tattoo.  Its not an uncommon tattoo, ESPECIALLY for Brazilian girls that don't live in Brazil.. I guess its a way to keep them connect to their "home".<br>  <br>  If I were you I'd come up with something a little bit diff.  When I was about to get mine, I ALMOST got that tattoo as well on my lower stomach, but opted for a dragonfly in the Brazilian flag colors (the outside of the wings are green, with yellow shading inside, and blue in the middle) It ended up looking really cute.. Although not original AT ALL lol it has a special meaning to me and i usually have to explain color choices.<br>  <br>  Idk thats just my opinion, its up to you though... it will look cute, prob like on the back of your neck or ankle. <br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	that's awesome!!|`|xDoJK2gTaa	i think thats very original  and it sounds like sometihng i would do lol|`|FJswVeqbaa	i say no|`|g2h6qUUXaa	that's a cool idea how about u get it on your lower back|`|TK1jVIkzaa	Love the idea :)<br>  <br>  If you dont want it on your lower back like a doll would have you could put it on your neck.... i know you already said that but it would show all the time and employers might frown on it<br>  <br>  OR you could get it on the sole of one of your feet. But people wouldn't see it much...|`|diMuDhPEaa	Are you sure that's a good idea putting it out in the open like that? Think about your future career and how you will be judged it you have a tattoo showing.|`|X79S1undaa	i think it's a neat idea. might even want to consider doing it in white ink o it looks even more a part of you.|`|9isF0Nugaa	As long as its not big and it looks tastefull, back of kneck or foot def<br>  i think its a cute idea
y1Jl9UcTaa	Fringe, jet black hair or long, or crop short|`|Ib9E2MITaa	For girls it seems like more and more stars are cutting their hair shorter and shorter. But for guys it seems like the shaggy look is coming back which to me is not attractive. I'd rather have them clean cut.|`|F6ZUiuXVaa	short, choppy, hair with side bangs<br>  <br>  it looks cute when you put it in a ponytail
kFxpqWGGaa	Go to M.A.C<br>  they have really light make up|`|F6ZUiuXVaa	i go to clinique<br>  <br>  they look at ur skin tone and they put alittle bit on ur skin to see if it matches<br>  <br>  i have powder and this creme foundation that matched perfectly with my skin|`|nhLakq35aa	The lightest drugstore foundation I have been able to find is l'oreal's true match. Department store brands that I have had good luck with have been MAC and Lancome.

STY5pSAsaa	i had really blonde hair. i never dyed it, i got highlights done cause its not as damaging. And then i got my hair dyed brown. it isn't damaging but its kind of a pain to go back to blonde. i recommend getting it done at a salon with someone you trust. don't strip the color or anything, get highlights done.<br>  it wont be orange and i promise you'll love it :)|`|lRr46ABUaa	No I dont think it will fall out. If you want to make sure your hair is strong enough you do a stretch test on it. That means you pull a strand of hair out and you stretch it. If the strand stretches and then goes back it is okay to dye. If you stretch it and it breaks then I would say do not dye your hair again for a while :)|`|iMdqB8hRaa	Go to a salon and take your dye out.<br>  Then do hot conditioner treatment and then dye it. <br>  Then it won't be damaged.|`|OJQqbIu4aa	no it wont fall out<br>  i always dye my hair right after|`|2yEQE2U4aa	depending on what type of hair dye you use <br>  pure color doesn't harm hair bad <br>  <br>  to be carefull id go to your hair dresser to be safe

Like you, I have tried many things in my pursuit to cure my acne, including things such as Proactive and Accutane (which I saw someone prefer, and I DO NOT recommend). It's also is not wise to look for one reason, since over the years you could have all kinds of allergens, out of control blood sugar levels, and all sorts of things, so trying to pinpoint one cause is not smart.<br>  <br>  Truth is you don't need any supplements or any topical to get clear. There's no miracle cure to clearing your acne, and medications such as Accutane can have harsh side effects (I personally experienced the worst headaches I've ever had the month I was on it, it also came back much worst after I decided to go off the regiment).<br>  <br>  I'm clear now, thanks to a great book called Clear For Life, which you can read more about here: <a href="http://findaremedy.com/clear-for-life-acne-ebook." rel="nofollow">http://findaremedy.com/clear-for-life-ac...</a> To answer your question specifically, though, you must increase your intake of whole foods, such as organic, fruits, raw, ripe, etc.<br>  <br>  I can see that you don't drink much water which is also a big no-no; you must increase your water intake to around 10% of your total weight, or at the very least, 8 cups a day. Eating enough raw foods such as fruits and vegetables will help you out big time. You also need a bit of exercise and even sunlight.<br>  <br>  Anyway, after 7 years of having pretty bad acne I can say I'm clear using the methods thought in this book. I feel like the guy on that Clearasil commercial after going back to the ice cream shop, lol. Well, good luck on your pursuit to cure your acne. I can say after having spent maybe 1k+ on topicals, medications, and supplements, I wish I would have found this book earlier. It took about a good 3 months for it to fully clear with the occasional breakout every now and then for the first 4-5 months, but it worked. An added benefit was I lost weight have more energy and I'm much stronger -- I think of it as a bonus.

wemgrzjwaa	Going to a beauty salon and speaking to a professional is sometimes helpful, but there is also a downside: People now a days are looking to make a quick buck and they sometimes will tell you that the only way to have healthy beautiful hair is to have it done by them, which isn't necesarily true, and that could be a little costly. There are things you could do at home as well without any harsh chemicals, also equip yourself with an excellent deep conditioner which you could buy at any beauty supply store.<br>  Natural solutions for gray hair:<br>   <a href="http://www.helium.com/items/1267590-natural-solutions-for-gray-hair-home-remedies-for-gray-hair-gray-hair-inexpensive-hair-care" rel="nofollow">http://www.helium.com/items/1267590-natu...</a>|`|Y5a3n1E6aa	Best solution? Go to a good hair salon and tell them to dye it for you.  This seems like a serious matter and you do NOT want to mess up by doing it yourself or it will be difficult to fix.  Professionals know what is best for you because they can determine what condition your hair is in.  I repeat,  DO NOT TO THIS YOURSELF!

kUE3Ddktaa	My all-time favorite mascara is Maybelline Full & Soft, which I get at CVS for about $6. It doesn't clump or look fake, but it does make my lashes look really thick.<br>  <br>  For liquid eyeliner, I like Cover Girl Line Exact Liner. It's like a very fine felt-tip pen that is super-easy to apply and lasts a long time. You can use it to make a very fine line or a bolder line.

Some of those brands at the drug store can be close to or about the same price as Mac.  But sorry I don't think any of them are any good.  I only use and recommend Mac.  Their lipstick is like 14 bucks which really isn't that much more than Loreal.  Besides most of those brands test on animals Mac does not and 100% of the profits from their Viva Glam lipstick goes to the research of aids.  So all around Mac is worth spending twice the price.|`|bhyUX6kkaa	try the event makeup artist for everything beauty makeup.

Feathering will affect the look of the hair, and may involve having some layers and then brushing/blow drying it a specific way in order to get the feathered look. <br>  Show the hairdresser a picture and ask what products they recommend for your hair and they should be able to help you. A picture is worth 1000 words.
pqkXISy4aa	Id recommend doing a strip of dark eyeshadow (brown grey dark blue whatever your going for) just over you eye lashes den a lighter colour above that but not to dark or to light and continue with another lighter colour den blend in the lines were each colour meets one and other with a fine brush and your eyes will be smokin hot lol... You wont get it the first time it will take a few trys but keep at it and dont give up...

First put it on really dark right above your eyelashes, then don't put anymore shadow on brush (important to use brush, not sponge) and sweep it back and forth over the top part of your crease to where when your eye is open you can barely see the top edge of the color below your eyebrow. (this is hard to explain in writing) It should look like a fade on a truck (ha ha) dark at the bottom to medium in crease to light before getting to your eyebrow. Sweep a light white or gold over your eyebrow bone and blend it down just a little to mix the 2! looks great!

And cartilidge piercings get pissy quite easily.<br>  <br>  Buy a quartz retainer for school, and leave it in. Preferably only change it at weekends or something. Acrylic retainers are bad for any long-term use, but a quartz one will last indefinately.<br>  <br>  You can also use cammomile compresses. Make a cup of hot pure cammomile tea. Leave to cool a bit, and dump the tea bag on your nose for 5 minutes or so, once a day.<br>  You could also use one drop of tea tree oil or emu oil once a day instead.<br>  <br>  Make-up should be fine, but avoid getting it near the hole, leave a little space around the hole.|`|Z0ZDyIPkaa	so many things wrong with this.<br>  <br>  you dont pierce cartilage with a gun. ever.<br>  <br>  get a good nose ring and wear it always, or let it close up and have it redone when you can.<br>  <br>  the little bump is a keloid scar. they are caused by irritation and can be genetic. if you dont start caring for it right, its only gonna get bigger. <br>  <br>  example of one that got a little bigger:<br>  <a href="http://www.visualdxhealth.com/images/dx/webChild/keloid_1269_lg.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.visualdxhealth.com/images/dx/...</a>|`|7urRIYMbaa	if its on the inside, theres nothing wrong.<br>  its just the cartlidge.<br>  i did the same thing with the school thing as you.<br>  i just said screw it and left it out.<br>  <br>  good job for perservering!<br>  <br>  best of luck.<br>  xoxo<br>  paige.|`|dpwMHg8maa	I have one of those bumps on my ear from where it was pierced up in the cartalige part.  However, it is really  not good for your piercing that you keep taking it out and putting it back in. This really keeps it from healing properly which may also be what the bump is. If you want it to heal properly, you must either put tape over it, or get one of those nose studs that are clear.  But seriously, you should prolly stop having it heal like that then re pierce it. Definatly not good|`|Wn4UbHVXaa	I'm not exactly sure if this is what it is... but it might be hypertrophic scarring. I think it's caused by trauma to the piercing. Taking it out and putting it back in every single day might do that. Tea tree oil, sea salt soaks and making sure you don't touch it make it most of the time go away. It takes time for the scarring to go away. But other times it can go away fast. Just depends on the person.|`|eAa7uWVfaa	oh my goodness...,.my nose has been pierced for 5 yrs and that bump on top your nose is nothing unusual. ive got one right now. its an on and off thing that keeps appearing. i really couldnt tell u what to do. i usually take out the ring, clean it, clean your nose then replace it with a new one or put the cleaned one back in.|`|tbwp9Ko8aa	You need to buy a proper nose stud.<br>  I had it done with a gun and a earring stud and ended up taking i out.<br>  Then i got it repierced correctly and it's easier.<br>  <br>  Go to either your GP or a local piercing shop for correct information.|`|TWol6a30aa	crush up an aspirin and mix it with a few drops of water and rub it on your nose.

Try natural deep conditioning mask and a styling serum (to moisturize and protect hair prior to styling) and proper natural 100% ceramic/tourmaline styling irons and dryers.

2ZsRAxkuaa	Its hypertrophic scarring, which most cartilidge piercings get.<br>  Dab one drop of tea tree oil on, with a cotton bud/q-tip, directly onto the bump. Avoid getting it anywhere else. Once a day.<br>  You could also use emu oil or cammomile compresses (which I much prefer). ake a cup of hot pure cammomile tea. Leave to cool a bit, and dump the tea bag on your nose for 5 minutes or so, once a day.<br>  They take a while to get rid of either way, so you you just have to be patient.<br>  <br>  They're caused by irritation or trauma, normally from being bashed, or ill-fitting jewellery. If they've been in for a while, it would be worth taking a trip to a proper, experienced piercer, and finding soem better fitting jewellery. And they can change it without irritating it further.<br>  <br>  Keloids are genetic, rather rare, and don't go away and have to be lasered off. But you don't need to worry about those :)|`|QNhyowIKaa	its natural for there to be bumps there, its just the hole healing.<br>  <br>  just clean your ear and take care of the piercing.|`|HkhwvHgLaa	Well, to be honest it sounds like you might have keloids. I had the exact same thing in the same area and on my second hole. If you try to remove it; it can come back bigger. They will not go away, unless you go to a doctor and get them removed which they will tell you that its a 50 50 chance either way. Keloids suck!|`|zcGLGPGsaa	well i just used hydrogen peroxide!<br>  it works the best.<br>  take the earring out, or just pour the peroxide on there<br>  it will sting<br>  then use neosporin.<br>  haha its definitely the best way to go.<br>  helped me with my belly button and cartilage
wzo1TX4Xaa	yeah wash them  and use a light conditioner let them dry naturally than straighten on a low heat after that apply a shine spray this will keep frizz at bay and keep a sheen on your hair also apply a frizz or dry end serum 2 the ends (not 2 much ) just enough to keep it looking sleek not greasy. The key to good extensions is to care for them as u would your own hair|`|zfiiC5JZaa	Leave them in a little jar of conditioner overnight, wash then dry like you would your own hair.|`|JbSebJJYaa	A good serum or oil sheen (:<br>  <br>  - Paul Mitchell Salon Professional|`|K2SOMH6iaa	no.|`|QNhyowIKaa	wash them with shampoo and conditioner.<br>  treat them like you would your real hair.|`|gXxEsWcxaa	Wash them?

dF490n0Oaa	i wouldn't know but, that dress is pretty and all, but i have seen way better hehehe. course i wouldnt know, im a guy..............:P
wq6lfHIBaa	try using a conditioner that is not as heavy, something more light.Oh also try washing it only 2 a week, even if your hair is oily, its healthy!!! and then it will slowly get used to it and wont be so greasy.<br>  <br>  Also why would you delete comments that you don't like....if your only here, to hear what you want, you maybe shouldn't ask for peoples opinions...|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	You are washing your hair far too often, and you are using your fingertips and 'scrubbing' your scalp far too much and for too long.  Try to use only your palms when you wash your hair next, and use only 1/3-1/4 the usual amount of shampoo.  Rinse well (but no 'scrubbing' at your scalp) and use only the palms, and 1/3-1/4 the conditioner (or use no conditioner).  Your hair should stay 'clean looking' longer (the MOST you should wash your hair is twice a week, and once a week is better yet).  Yes, you will eventually see some 'grease' because you are young and are full of 'hormones' right now ... but if you do, simply put a tiny bit of corn starch onto your palms and then spread that into your hair ... then use a 'soft bristle brush' to get it out again, and the grease will be gone.  I learned how to properly wash my hair because I had surgery at the base of the back of my neck when I was 21, and couldn't take a shower or wash my hair for over two months ... these 'tricks' helped me to feel and look 'normal' ... and now I know them and can 'pass them on' to you ...|`|fk7ZA9b8aa	ok well if you have white people hair you should wash it every day.|`|GLOBmh0Baa	It depends on what type of hair you have. Not washing your hair enough makes it greasy, but also, washing your hair too often can make it greasy too. The only way I can keep my hair shiny is by washing it every day, but it's not very healthy to wash hair every day. It strips the natural oils from the hair and makes it dry. So, if I was you I would try using a different shampoo, or maybe try washing it every day. If that doesn't help it's probably just your hormones because you are at the age where it will get greasier quicker.|`|hQHWVRyTaa	I have always had the same problem, and I'm 42! It was explained to me by a dermatologist years ago that the follicles in my scalp were producing excess oil, and it simply works its way down the hair, and gives it a greasy look. I currently use Head & Shoulders w/ Conditioner, and my hair looks great!<br>  <br>  I also wash it every morning before I start my day.|`|zDqlHcGSaa	Hi, I'm 17 and I have greasy hair. I have to wash it every day, or it looks terrible. Here's a few things I've learned over time.<br>  You have to use a good shampoo, the cheap ones don't cut it. Look for one that works with your hair type, you know if you have dry hair get a moisturizing shampoo, if your hair is straight, get a smoothing one, and so on.<br>  <br>  Every few months or so, switch brands of shampoo for about 1 month, bc after a while, the shampoo that you use builds up in your hair and doesn't seem to be effective. My favorite brands to go back and forth between are panene and aussie.<br>  You can also try vinegar, or baking soda for this problem too. Just wash your hair as normal, then do a final rinse of 1 cup vin. diluted in 1 c. water. Or make a paste of water and baking soda, put it on your wet hair and wait about 10 minutes, then wash your hair like normal. It also strips grease buildup.<br>  <br>  When you wash your hair, don't scrub your scalp with your fingertips, this will only stimulate your scalp to produce more oil. Instead, lather up gently, then leave the shampoo on your hair for at least 5 minutes, for "deep" cleaning. (good time to shave your legs!!)<br>  Then rinse out and condition as normal, but only on the ends of your hair, never the roots (very important or people with oily hair to remember!!)<br>  <br>  <br>  Another thing to be careful of is overuse of heated tools for your hair. Over time, this can dry out your hair and cause it to add moisture back by creating more grease. Be sure and condition well ONLY ON THE ENDS OF YOUR HAIR, NEVER THE ROOTS if you use a flat iron or blow dryer every day. I try to give my hair a couple of days break now and then to keep it healthy.<br>  Check out the hair products you use. Often, gels, mousses and pomades even smoothers and shine sprays can make your hair look and feel greay. Try using less, or switch brands.<br>  <br>  You can try dry shampoo, which is just a powder you put into your hair between shampoos that soak up the extra oil. Often, they can be pricey. I've found that baby powder works just as good, or even loose makeup powder for your face. just sprinkle it your hands and rub into your hair where it looks oily.<br>  You can even use blotting papers for your face on your hair. Works like a charm!!!<br>  Hope this helps!|`|CfPQwq3Qaa	There could be a couple of reasons for this.  One, as a teen your horomones change continuously.  I'm sure your tired of hearing that, but it can have an affect on your hair.<br>  <br>  Also, if you scratch your head a lot, it can also release oils from your scalp.  That is why we scratch our heads when our scalp is dry.  But there can be a number of reasons for scratching.<br>  <br>  There is also your diet.  If you have changed your diet to eating fattier or greasier foods, this can have an affect too.<br>  <br>  Are you doing more to break a sweat.  This adds oils to your skin.  Since, our head end up warmer than the rest of our body, it sometimes produces sweat sooner than the rest of our body does because it needs to to cool down.  Sweat is the bodies way to cool itself, but doesn't always work if you have a very full head of hair that rests against the scalp.<br>  <br>  I would suggest using a buildup remover shampoo occassionally or change to a clarifying shampoo for a short time.  It isn't something you need all the time, but might remove the oils more effectively.  You can also make sure you shampoo rinse and REPEAT.  you can try using a different conditioner too (or use it less).  Look into what products you use in your hair.  <br>  <br>  These are just a number of factors to consider.  Somebody once told me that I shouldn't wash my hair everyday or it can cause your body to think it needs to produce more oils and overproduce them.  I don't know if this is true though.  Still, I've been told not to wash everyday by a number of experts of other reasons.|`|5Lw7feUkaa	My friend was saying kinda the same thing the other day, she mentioned her hair dresser friend suggested to wash it every two days but don't always condition it... also she uses 'dry shampoo in a can' tha you can get from Boots etc, spray it on when it's greasy and it sucks up the moisture... so no more greasy hair! Hope this helps!|`|6ad1dc296ecb7c905f1e7277c442d32baa	well for me I use the tub and then kI wash my hair in the tub and in the fountain thing, and so that is maybe why mine gets oily easy so if you do the same thing then that might happen.  thisnk about this, if you add too much shampoo or conditioner then maybe the product is still in your hair and that causes the oily ness.|`|C7FxHBwBaa	either use a clarifying shampoo and a light conditioner, or wash your hair every day. I had greasy hair as a teen and washing it every day with a clarifying shampoo really helped. As far as it suddenly changing, hey your body goes through a lot of whacked out changes when you're a teen|`|0Tst4RJ2aa	It's your body going through changes, it's puberty and should pass soon. Make sure you don't use and products other than whats needed and you might want to look into a different shampoo.|`|SqNoMz7vaa	It just means that your body is producing more sweat and the hair is getting double moisture. Are you a sports person..? If yes, well, that explains your problem.|`|vdLOFQgDaa	it might be the foods your eating stop eating buckets of grease from fast food and you should be fine|`|8jY4JUw7aa	ur prob are sweating more|`|hvzM2FmVaa	Try using special a Light Formula shampoo. I think garnier do one and possibly panten pro V. Also, make sure you only put conditioner on the middle to ends of your hair and not near the roots :)|`|jXIS4npBaa	Its probley the shampoo your using. That happened to me and i wash my hair everyday.|`|vdvD31uNaa	my hair does then same thing its cause your scalp is producing alot of oils you need to change your shampo and conditioner it should help
2ZsRAxkuaa	I haven't had any medical scars. But I do have a few pretty serious ones. And tanning (naturally) just made them an awful lot more noticable as the scar tissue didn't change colour, just everything around it.<br>  There was a guy I knew once with a serious looking medical scar, which stayed bright white all year round, while the rest of him got really tanned from being outside so much.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't risk tanning with a scar until its healed, and ask the salon people and/or the doctor about it first, just in case.<br>  Maybe try sun block on the scar area?
3rqd6N29aa	Dark Circles:  caused by circulation and such i think so just lightly rub from the outside to the inside with small circles and it should help with circulation. Cold Spoons get rid of puffiness<br>  <br>  Wrinkles: sorry.. no idea.<br>  <br>  Acne:  Cinnamon, honey, and lemon juice scrub.  Also after the scrub dab some honey on the acne spots.  Honey is an antiseptic and helps kill bacteria and what nots.  Also just plain Lemon Juice.  Might lighten your skin tho.|`|kxlmcG4gaa	Google "Home remedies for skin problems"<br>  There isnt really a specific website i could give to you as they are all as good as each other, but google it anyway and see what comes up (:|`|d9afb5f10eed7750b0b4604b351f8e22aa	No, I can't, I don't know any.
kUE3Ddktaa	Look for scrubs and cleansers that contain salicylic acid - this is a medicine that breaks down the dead skin that clogs your pores and causes blackheads. I know the the Clean and Clear "Clear Advantage" line of products contains salicylic acid, and I see it at the grocery store and CVS.<br>  <br>  Pore strips are really only effective on the REALLY clogged blackheads that stick up from your skin. The strips won't reach down into the skin to get the small-but-irritating blackheads that are peppered on your face, unfortunately. You will have much better luck with a scrub and cleanser combo.|`|a24ef19d34a8e1a074ec6b3f3983a7e6aa	I'd just squeeze them out. To prevent future ones, wash your face regularly with facial cleanser. Use warm water to wash (it opens up your pores and cleanses them) and cold water to rinse (it closes up your pores, preventing more matter from accumulating).|`|3rqd6N29aa	steam your face.  Wether in a shower or over a boiling pot.  Then scrub (ST Ive Apricot scrub or just use Cinnamon or sugar). Steam it again and wash with a good oil free wash (i use neutrogena) and after you rinse with warm water.. do a second rinse with colder water to help close your pores.  Thats what i do.<br>  <br>  The strips are fine if your blackheads are really bad and "stick up".  other thn that they dont help for the tiny ones that you cant feel, but only see.  The BIORE ones are the only ones ive tried.. worked fine.  About 8$ for the biggest pack i saw.. got it from walmart.<br>  <br>  Oh also use a good "Astringent"  it gets rid of any oil on the face which helps to clean up a bit so no more junk gets in your pores.|`|9qVQNN7qaa	Sunshine is good....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.healthdab.com/2007/10/12/how-to-get-rid-of-blackheads/" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthdab.com/2007/10/12/how-...</a><br>  <br>  and CLEARASIL DEEP PORE SCRUB is brilliant..... use it on dry skin and scrub once a day...... It has a lot of  SALICYLIC  acid in..(not sure if I spelled that right...)  which unsticks dead skin, so your pores don't block....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.acne.org/over-the-counter.php?view=Salicylic+Acid" rel="nofollow">http://www.acne.org/over-the-counter.php...</a><br>  <br>  I use a cleanser after... "Clean and clear" cleansing lotion works a treat....|`|1YbIyjMQaa	Simple no product needed. Go to a beauty supply store and buy an extractor under $10. Go home and steam your face for about 10 min. Use the extractor and it will get them out. A simple push should pop them all the way out. Tone your face and your done :)|`|CQESMsV8aa	I wouldn't recommend the strips because they usually don't remove blackheads (just clogged pores) and just make your pores look bigger. There aren't many things that can get rid of blackheads, especially over night.

jo9p0jBwaa	the colour will always look darker at first. give it a week or two of washing every night and you will see a big difference. when i dyed my hair a similar colour it started almost black and then faded to an auburn colour.
AA12264505	why dont you search internet?
PDY2F7PBaa	Afro hair, needs alot of moisture to grow. <br>  So wash it with a creamy shampoo, condition it,  once a week. And apply a leave in moisturizer like Nexxus creme every other day. You're hair will be softer, stronger and will grow.|`|KuVNm4R2aa	It's either <br>  <br>  A) in your genes<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  B) you don't eat healthy enough foods|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Hair naturally grows 1/2" average per month.  Hair is primarily made up of protein.  To increase hair growth rate, try increasing your protein intake from the foods you eat:  eggs, peanut butter, certain nuts, meat, etc...And you can take protein powder shakes.  <br>  Also if you under stress in your life, that will cause your hair to grow slower and even cause you to lose hair.  It is called "stress alopecia".  Another tactic is to have your head below the level of the heart to increase blood flow to the scalp and massage/brush your head and hair with a horse hair or boar's hair brush.<br>  All of this worked for me and now my hair grows about 1" a month.  I just cut off 4" of my hair and it grew back plus some in 2 months.  Weird huh?|`|Y5a3n1E6aa	It's in your genes.  There's nothing you can do about it.
hzxplycYaa	Your hair seems to be really stressed and damaged. My hair used to be like that several years ago from all the perms and dyes. What I did was cut my hair short yet stylish. I bought several treatments (kerastase is amazing) and used it twice a week. I really suggest you cut your hair first. Let your hair breathe! Stop the chemicals & dyes! Use a good shampoo or conditioner, try to avoid sulfate in them because it dries out your hair. Find hair supplies that label "sulfate-free". Also, STOP STRAIGHTENING YOUR HAIR! If you must, use a lot of shine serum from the root to top before straightening. You need to sacrifice some stuff to keep your hair growing healthy and maintaining it's health (ex: cutting your hair, tying it up in a bun on typical occasions, etc.)|`|8rt7OR35aa	stop coloring it and such for a while and let it grow out then cut as much of the burnt nasty hair off.|`|QB7unWyAaa	Stop colouring it, switch to semipermanent colour.<br>  <br>  Stop straightening if you can, or use it less and on a lower setting. <br>  <br>  Use a damage repair shampoo (TresEmme is goooood).<br>  <br>  Increase the protien in your diet.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|m7VMwAplaa	Stop coloring and straightening it immediately. Eventually it'll get better.
xck7VmVeaa	You can be anything you want to as long as you believe in your self, get involved in modeling see what they think about you!

mJbwemH8aa	Well regarding that type of arm hair, i would advice u to bleach it and dont remove it, i think yr still young, so it will remain like that, just bleach it and it will look great, i do that to most of my clients instead of removing it.<br>  <br>  .|`|TdGbIDH8aa	It isn't that bad to make it look lighter just wear a little lotion :)|`|2wdVqIc7aa	I had a friend that shaved her arm hair because she was self conscious. Then she hated it because she had to shave it very often or it was prickly. Much worse than legs she said. Anyway, I am white but my arm hair is dark and noticeable and I have had people ask me why not shave/bleach it. I think everyone has it, some you can just see easier. If you feel bad about it bleach it or use one of those hair removing creams (so when it grows back it won't be prickly). Remember, you are beautiful! And so is your arm hair lol! :)|`|jo9p0jBwaa	oh that's not bad at all. my whole family is italian, and let me tell you, they are hairy. only a really shallow person would have an issue with your arms, so don't worry.|`|BLLdUrWVaa	im of hispanic descent tooo.<br>  <br>  & i had the same problem.<br>  <br>  i just bleached them & they looked lighter.<br>  <br>  sooo maybe you should do that.|`|vXhu9ac5aa	I think your fine just the way you are!  If God wanted you to have short blond hairs on your arm he would have made you Norwegian!
xDEYAUwGaa	Id say either use purples or browns.  Purples look amazing with brown eyes, so I am assuming it would help bring it out too.  Also, hazel eyes tend to relfect off of colors so maybe using a brown eyeshadow will make them more brown.  Also, wearing a brown shirt will help.  Just mess around with different colors and see what works best.  If all else fails, you can always get brown contacts.. good luck!|`|TdGbIDH8aa	Def. more of the dark brown or black I've noticed I have brown eyes and black brings them out :)<br>  Omg hazel is so pretty why would you wanna hide that|`|a57c8c672f006f88f08496bd86f7caa6aa	Purple
6X2XLVblaa	I liked the way Maybelline mousse looked, it did make me look "airbrushed" it has nice coverage but, it transfers VERY easily, I would get it all over my husband and my cloths if it touched my shirts, especially if I was changing. It also made me break out a lot, so even though it looked good it wasn't worth it to me. I stopped using it. No7 Is a bit better than Maybelline, it gave smooth coverage and looked nice as well, it didn't transfer as much as Maybelline but it did a little. I found that TruBlend Mousse Foundation from Cover girl is better out of the mousse foundations. <br>  <br>  <br>  Out of the two I would say No7, but you could also try TruBlend<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|doha66YWaa	No7<br>  Not just because it is beter for all the above, but because when you buy Maybelline your money goes to L'Oreal (who own Maybelline), and L'Oreal test on animals.<br>  Im assuming you dont want to pay people to put cr*p in rabbits' eyes here.|`|K5yWLudIaa	Mooses are found in areas where there is heavy flows of snow.  They do not wear makeup and look most natural in their own habitats not captivitys.  You might want to contact your local park rangers to find out about the dangers of mooses.|`|3ATt7ZE6aa	Hi<br>  <br>  I only tried a mousse foundation because I needed something cheap and quick when I was in town one day. It is the best thing I have bought in a long time No7 mousse is amazing, it gives great even coverage and makes my skin look really soft and flawless. It also looks really natural, I hate the orange look but the No7 mousse matches my skin so well and not to much is needed. It also lasts well throughout the day, I bit of powder is needed to keep it in place but that is all. <br>  <br>  I really recommend it, I was only going to use this mousse for a few weeks until I can buy my more expensive foundation but I am never going back now! I really recommend going to Boots and getting the colour tested first so that it can look the best.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps xxx
6X2XLVblaa	Yes he can tan, but he will need lotion to ease he into tanning, you don't want to burn him. It will take a little longer than normal, but it's possible. The girls at the salon would also tell you the best ways for him to tan. Good Luck!|`|whKBjSmdaa	naaa normally rly white ppl just get red and get burned, it's difficult to get a tan in these conditions. getting burnt is dangerous...|`|yrkMVrbtaa	That sucks. My boyfriend has the same issue. He's got flame red hair, white grey eyes, and skin that is dead porcelain white ( I mean no signs of pink, blue, yellow tones or anything in his skin, just white.) No color what so ever and he can not tan to save him self. He's beyond white and he burns so easily I worry that he might get a massive sun burn if he's not careful. I don't think you fiance should tan if it will burn him really badly. It may look good to be tan but I don't think it's worth it if he will be the one in pain because of it.|`|NwdvjsWXaa	If he's very pale he is more likely to burn than tan, but he still can, just gradually. You could try a spray tan is the honeymoon is soon. It will look natural as long as its a proper salon.|`|YF3uPqPfaa	with the right stuff you can get it done.  it's all about balance though.  that's what i'll tell anyone with style|`|yuun8RDCaa	my friend never tans and only burns :(|`|FPITkq7yaa	He is able to tan. Unless you are albino, which means you have no melanin, you have the ability, however if he is very white, he may do damage to his skin while tanning. Tanning booths for someone with very pale skin is not a good idea. I would embrace the pale, and sunscreen up before exposing his skin to the sun.<br>  <br>  HTH<br>  <br>  I just wanted to add, if you put baby oil on him before getting him out in the sun, you will certainly cause him major burns and agony, and possibly long term damage. I am assuming that is not what you want for your honeymoon.|`|ZcD578XXaa	ok this will sound totally weird... but use baby oil.. and have him sit out in the sun for no more than 15 minutes, and he should have some color.<br>  <br>  <br>  but idk.. im mexican and it works well for me, but who knows? give it a try?<br>  <br>  or have him get like that banana boat tanning oil, and just spray it on him whenever you two are out on the boat deck
ZcD578XXaa	I work at walgreens, and i noticed this special tool by this company called studio 31 or something, and they sell tools designed for acrylic nails and stuff, so maybe check at a drug store and ask someone in the cosmetics department to help you out :)|`|YF3uPqPfaa	i've known women who do nails well by themself

9H9WrHGQaa	After many years of trial and error and much $ washed down the drain (literally-lol) I say rather than go cheap, save a bit for a good product! I learned the hard way that throwing good money after bad as they say, you pay more in the long run. I have similar skin concerns and forked out the $38.00 (breath) for Stila -think about it you buy 3 cheapys-there is your same amount. Stila Illuminating (I use 10 watt the lightest-20 watt for light skin and up from there). The powder minerals (even though I used to swear by Bare Escentuals) tends to look dry and go without powder, but I still love it. Moisurize,use a Alpha hydroxy acid to unplug the glued on dry flakes (yea-ew) and drink water! If you have an ULTA or Sephora by, go try it on first! Many good brands to try. Good luck.|`|xDEYAUwGaa	I would definately go for bare  minerals makeup, its amazing!  Or if you want something a little cheaper, get the loreal natural coverup.  Its like in a tub thing and has the brush on top.   My sister loves it.|`|O25ix9kGaa	I really like sheer cover; I feel like it covers up my flaws and makes my skin look smooth.  It's expensive though.  I use Revlon's Colorstay also they have two formulas for combination oily skin and dry skin. This stuff is heavy duty coverage and doesn't rub off.  I usually wear this everyday and wear the sheer cover if I'm going somewhere special.

P7rosHBNaa	Since your skin is medium tone, I believe you could pull the black off. Before dying it black I think you should leave out sections of your hair that you want to dye purple, because it will be easier than dying it black then purple. The sections you leave out I would bleach because the purple will look more vibrant. <br>  <br>  Try this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.manicpanic.com/best%20hair%20color/ultraviolet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.manicpanic.com/best%20hair%20...</a>|`|VkzmH1GKaa	Best advice, stop and go see a stylist.

a57c8c672f006f88f08496bd86f7caa6aa	If he doesn't call you or text you back, he obviously has no interest in being with you. What a cowardly ***. A real man doesn't flirt with other girls in front of you. Dump him, girl you deserve so much better than this asshole. There's a thing called Karma, and it means "What comes around goes around." So whatever pain he sends out to countless women as he moves on in his life, it will all come back to him eventually, and he will realize what he's done. Let Karma do the revenge.<br>  <br>  Don't waste your tears on him. You'll find someone better in time. It does hurt and it might hurt for a while, but it takes time to heal. Trust me there are better guys out there.<br>  <br>  If he's going to be all weird and ignore you, then ignore him right back! Don't call him or text him or talk to him AT ALL. Give him a taste of his own medicine. If he tries to talk to you, then ignore him. He will then know how you feel. If he's this stupid and empty-headed right now, there's NO use trying to talk sense into him. Just leave it like it is, he will learn the hard way. Here's a quote that I heard somewhere. It's one of my favorites:<br>  "Breakups are like broken glass. It's better to just leave it alone than to risk hurting yourself trying to fix it."<br>  <br>  Be nice to yourself. Dress in clothes and put on makeup or do your hair (or whatever you like) in ways that make you feel beautiful. Forget about this son of a betch, and move on with life. He's not worth your tears. Focus on other guys, your friends, and all the good things in your life. Things will brighten up soon. Sometime when you find a REAL man who respects and cares about you, you'll look back and think "Wow that guy was such an asshole, I wonder how far he will get in life if he treats women like that all the time!" It will take time but trust me. I've had so much experience with guys, and I just recently got over a jerk so I know exactly how you feel. I'm still waiting for the right guy. It could be any day!

I also understand why you texted him. <br>  If he was being clear then you wouldnt be feeling this way, so you need to talk to him face to face (preferably), and basically just tell him what your telling us.

N0lmlVTOaa	It's not going to heal up in 0.5 seconds if thats what you mean. However, if you are having problems with the jewelry you have in now CONSULT YOUR PIERCER. There is a reason you are discouraged from changing jewelry before the healing period is complete.

And keep an eye on the new one--don't lose it or you'll find yourself with an empty closed up hole.<br>  <br>  Finally no your nose is still healing. But you can change it.

AA10281237	First of all, UK size 8 is very thin. In US sizes you would be a size 6, or a "Small". You are certianly at a good weight for your age. <br>  <br>  Secondly, you should NEVER skip meals as a diet. It's unhealthy. Your metabolism will slow down because you're not eating, actually making it harder for you to loose weight. Also, you're getting dangerously close to developing anorexia, which can kill you.<br>  <br>  While I don't think you need to loose any weight, my suggestion is that if you REALLY feel like you need to loose weight, try eating several smaller meals throughout the day, and make sure they're healthy (fruits/veggies instead of junk food snacks, etc.) and exercise more often. If you already excercise frequently, add 30 mintues to your routine. If you don't work out that often, try working out at least 3 days a week. <br>  <br>  Hopefully that helps.|`|T6iciES8aa	You really shouldn,t be paranoid about your weight be happy with who you are. One meal a day even when your on a diet is not enough!

The reason for you feeling sick is probaly because you have changed your diet so drastically, and the way you have changed it is so very unhealthy. Because your body isnt getting enough food, it will cling on to what food you do give it, this could cause putting on weight eventually. Also sometimes when people get hungry they get the feeling of sickness, so maybe its your bodys way of saying EAT SOMETHING!!! You dont need to loose weight, because you are size 8 that is fine its not fat, if you loose weight you will be to skinny and will look unhealthy.

4be98dd607dfed9ad18400ef02923955aa	my friends were eyeliner ALL the time and like around 2 hours or less it will fade simply because they rub their eyes,dont put to much on or put to much and it irritates their eyes causing them to rub it. And in result they ALWAYS have to carry it and put more on during the day. The reason why their eyeliner wont stick is because they dont use nor have a good base. (concealer) It's about $10-$14 and the packaging is a bit small for that amount of money but its defiantly worth it to have a good concealer or your make up looks horrible. It not only enhances you eyeliner but the look of your make up too, it makes it stick on longer, and it keeps your make up looking clean and fresh as when you first applied it. I dont have any recommendations because i've just started using it myself  :) but i just bought revlon beyond natural and i've used it a couple times and as far as i know its does its job and works as it's suppose to. Some concealers go beyond the job but i havent tried enough to tell you which one. I've heard good things about this concealer its called something potion (lol can't remember) but people say its really good only thing is that the packaging is extremely small for $14 <br>  hope i helped<br>  loves,keep looking beautiful ^_~<br>  hope i helped|`|UTb5chyJaa	I dont know if you use liquid but it always seems to last longer to me, and maybe see if you can find a brand that has a long wear formula, i believe maybelline does, just look next time you go to the drug store, i think thats te bestplace to buy make up, they have a good selection, and its not overpriced.

There are liners you can get that are guaranteed to be smudge free. Don't apply too much of any kind, however, or it will be more likely to smudge off.

EM5rQOGBaa	hi , i use to have short hair so can tell u a few things i use do <br>  <br>  1. butterfly clips , twist ur hair n clip them to hold in place <br>  2. a hairband ( use av loads glittery 1's n plain also asda do chip colour 1's)<br>  3.if ur hair is long enough to put in a small pony tail (even if it very lil) buy a hair bobble wif fake hair on it( the short 1's to look like a messy bun )|`|UtYOwE4Laa	it's cuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuute!|`|JPAYaFgsaa	i dont think you can do much to it ;p<br>  except spike it up with gel or use some hairspray to give it some volume.<br>  or clip your bangs to the side with a pretty clip :D<br>  <br>  and dont mind what "hgieleah" said [a few answers below mine].. there are horrible people out there!|`|Sm9cq8KKaa	You (assuming that that really is you) are very pretty, and the haircut is super cute! Try clipping the long bangs loosely to one side of your face with a clip...I think that would be pretty. Also try putting a clip on either side and clip the bangs up that way.|`|yrxENGqbaa	just leave ur hair like that maybe you can add a clip or two on the side|`|BO28Mn8haa	i think it'd look cute with a headband. and some high lights!|`|QFnaCs5saa	I think you should experiment with the wax type hair products!  You will have lots of fun with it too...they are my favorite to play with! Here are your options:<br>  <br>  You could go crazy and mess it all up...seriously just rub a little on your hands and mess your hair all around until you find something fun!<br>  <br>  You can rub a bit of the product between your fingers and pick only sections of your hair, like the front pieces and the parts near your ear...and flip them, or twist them. That would be a cute easy to do every day thing you could do. And the flipping helps short hair look more feminine, flip them towards your hair on the sides and pick a side in the front.<br>  <br>  Fora  sleek 'evening' look you can slick it all back. That look is super chic!  <br>  <br>  And well...I think this type of product will be fun, but you might need to try a couple before you find one that doesn't make your hair TOO greasy looking...unless you like that. Also, a tip, don't use too much! But seriously your 'do is hot and very fashion forward! It really brings people to focus on your pretty face features! : )|`|CB7QJO4uaa	After much research I  recommend you go see the websites below for solution.

eBgrIgnzaa	I think u should go to a derm. i go to a derm,and had really bad acne before and now my face cleared up in 6 months. My derm. prescribed me doxyciline pills,and two face solutions and it works great.|`|DFuWEy4faa	Ohh on your nose? Ouch. Meh! well popping them isn't THAT bad . 1/100 of them will leave a scar, so if your willing to take that risk. I pop mine when i get them, and ive no scars, and it makes them feel and look much better.<br>  Im on medication for my pimples, which aren't that bad at all... but i find that using toothpaste over night and then getting dental floss in the morning and like go over and back with it will clear it up faster. [ i know it dries out your skin, but its better than pimples. ] anyway, ive loads of other methods too . ive tried almost everything lol. add me if you like. (: ill help you out. fob-naomi-mcr@hotmail.com <br>  good luck. xx|`|CASwFr7kaa	Popping them, it is ok just as long as they are ready to be popped. If there is a white head formed on them then you can pop it but needles are a no no. <br>  And there really isn't a miracle treatment, proactive and the wave are just money buys.<br>  Have you heard of St. Ives peach exfoliater? You can get that at walmart for 3$. Get that and since it exfoliates it will take the dead skin cells of every night so your skin can purify better.<br>  When you wash your face do you ever notice it feeling stretchy or tight? well when it feels this way your skin brings oils and mousturizers to the facial skin which is why the made a mousturizer product, some actually clear acne. For a moisturizer I use it every other night.<br>  There are different things for different skins, like if you have oily combination ETC. The bottle will point it out.<br>  No need to go all hay wire spending $ on expensive products. ST. IVES works excellent.|`|MjKOBQQqaa	Getting rid of blackheads is a difficult task. And there are many methods out there that simply don't work.<br>  <br>  For example...<br>  <br>  ......squeezing, steaming and popping.<br>  <br>  But here's a method that do work. It's called exfoliation.<br>  <br>  Exfoliation is the removal of the top layer of skin (the epidermis). And is effective for almost every type of facial skin care problem.<br>  <br>  But here's how exfoliation can get rid of blackheads......<br>  <br>  Blackheads form when sebum (natural oils produced by the skin) gets trapped in the skin's pores. And if these pores are partly open, then oxygen reacts with the trapped sebum, turning it black in color.<br>  <br>  Now to remove these blackheads requires you to "un-roof" the heads of the clogged pores.<br>  <br>  And guess what......<br>  <br>  ......that's exactly what exfoliation does when removing the epidermis of the skin.<br>  <br>  And once the head of the pore is removed, the trapped sebum can be taken out via cleansers and toners.<br>  <br>  So how do you exfoliate?<br>  <br>  Well you can visit a doctor's office to have a chemical peel, laser peel or a microdermabrasion procedure.<br>  <br>  But I must warn you that these procedures are expensive. In fact a chemical peel procedure can cost up to $300.<br>  <br>  But there's a cheaper way if you're interested.<br>  <br>  You can purchase the at-home versions of the chemical peels and/or microdermabrasion creams. These work well although you'll take a little longer to get the results your looking for.<br>  <br>  However, once you've removed the top layer of skin (the epidermis), you'll easily get that trapped sebum out of your pores.

f99f410d47123bf78dd5c13bff9bf849aa	If you can stand the smell. Tea Tree oil works wonders on acne. For even better result you can first use the Tea Tree facial wash then follow that up with applying the Tea Tree oil to the problem areas. It's not mandatory but using 100% all natural cotton balls are more effective than the synthetic ones. if you find that the scent from the oil is to overwhelming add a little water to the cotton ball and then add the oil before applying to your face. Good luck!|`|eZDoQPg8aa	My son has had good results with Acne Free's system of a cleanser, toner and a repair lotion.

Or is it caused by improper skin care practices?<br>  <br>  Here's how to find out.....<br>  <br>  At which area of your face do you usually break out first?<br>  <br>  Is it on your chin?<br>  <br>  Or..... is it on your forehead or cheeks?<br>  <br>  If the answer is the chin...then your acne is due to your hormones.<br>  <br>  But if it's either your forehead or your cheeks...then its due to improper skin care practices.<br>  <br>  I really hope that the answer isn't your chin. This type of acne (hormonal acne) is more difficult to treat.<br>  <br>  You will have to visit a doctor. And he/she may prescribe acne medication. <br>  <br>  But if it's due to improper skin care practices...it can easily be treated. And by the way improper skin care practices is the phrase I use for persons who....<br>  <br>  ....are constantly touching their faces with their hands, hair or other foreign objects (pens, cellphones, etc).<br>  <br>  To treat this type of acne will require a strict daily skin care routine. One which involves deep cleansing and exfoliation.<br>  <br>  These two processes will keep the pores clean. As well as remove debris and dead skin cell.<br>  <br>  You may also find the information at the following site informative:|`|6aa9bc0259ac73b74c83ca37ab2fce2eaa	well i personally scrub and scrub until my face is red and pretty much bleeding lol.. but if you want a simpler less painful solution get some Clearasil sorry i spelled it wrong but i think you know what i am talking about..  continue the treatment everyday and you should see a great solution in the next 2 days my skin normally does in 2 to 3 days hehe i hope i helped..<br>  Mandy|`|QQd1C9HGaa	i use toothpaste and occasionally hydrocortisone, but not for more then 7 days because its only an Anti-inflammatory so....
f7wWWroKaa	I used to work at both Hollister and Abercrombie & Fitch for 4 years and I know for a fact that the size 28 in the shorts will fit you fine. Hollister's sizes are much smaller than the sizes at A&F. I wear a 2 long at A&F and at Hollister I'm a size 5 (women size). Trust me I know because Hollister and A&F are the only brands I wear as casual clothing. I also know that the men's 28 will fit you fine because i have a pair of Hollister men's cargo shorts and I dont even have to wear a belt with them. Also, if you are a frequent visitor at Hollister you would notice kids 8 and up shopping there. I see 75lbs kids wearing Hollister clothes without a problem. That is why there is not a need for a Hollister kids store like abercrombie. Abercrombie and Fitch have ADULT sizes (although they still run a little smaller than most retail stores) and Hollister has JUNIOR sizes. SO buy the shorts they are so fab.,....and get a cute belt with it|`|137b30fb970bd391d42e9f79f3222ad7aa	I think they might be big, but you could order them and return them if they dont fit right.|`|5FLDzyhTaa	Abercrombie, Ed hardy,Hollister, Ruehl etc. you should definitely check these sites<br>  <a href="http://www.discountshollywood.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.discountshollywood.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.raininghollywood.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.raininghollywood.com</a><br>  shipping is FREE !!!!

You can get a pill at walmart that helps the hair and nails to grow faster and stronger, you can also try mane and tail ( for horse/ but humans use it also) good product shampoo and conditioner found in most stores that sales hair products, last but not least if it is long enough to keep up in a pony tail with a soft scrunkie will make it grow alot faster you want to make sure it is really snugged tight but don't over do it and get a headache I have a sis in law that is a beautician and she told me all this and it worked for me for yrs now from all these ideas I think keeping it up worked best seems like it keeps it from getting damaged also and I don't know if the pull from being tight helps it to grow or what but it will work.|`|SzdSa5ftaa	Go to any vitamin store or vitamin section, they have vitamins called Skin/Hair/Nail.

gl1DzouXaa	I have been using Removaline for 2 weeks and my friends have been telling me how great I look lately. The only thing I have been using that is different is Removaline|`|9D6Y4dYuaa	Hi there! <br>  <br>  I actually have the same problem and I have been looking everywhere for an effective cream. I have tried a lot of lotions, but nothing seems to make much of a difference. That's why I visit various beauty counters and sites to see if they are offering any freebies. You can get the most bang for your buck this way, by testing products before spending the money. Some sites have surveys, and things of the sort, to fill out before you have the free samples sent to you, but it's definitely worth the time.<br>  <br>  New technology  in the markey has allowed many breakthrough products to become available to everyone. Simply look for products that have natural ingredients such as, vitamins, amino acids, and natural extracts. These ingredients help stimulate skin regeneration and new skin cell production by increasing elasticity of the skin.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped and send me an e-mail if you happen to find anything worth trying. Here's a website I've used to score some samples, you should check it out. Good luck!|`|mgeuli7Naa	Olay regenerist, it really works!|`|T95c191eaa	o lay regenerist!!!<br>  my mom uses it!!<br>  it workd!!|`|fYkaxJYOaa	proative

286158035f0bdbcd6406fc818ecc200faa	Use Ritz powder and, even though shirt is white, use the dye remover First before using the dye.<br>  <br>  Also, it helps if, after it's been air dried, you rinse/soak it in vinegar and air dry it again And press it with a hot iron before washing as you normally would.  The vinegar "sets" the dye when you press the item.|`|nLc5OSfjaa	huh thats wierd..<br>  I've died pants with ritz liquid.<br>  and ive never had that problem.<br>  I started using the powder one tho.<br>  ..i think it stays in better.<br>  =]|`|6GWSI2XEaa	You can set the dye with non-iodized salt, about a cup added to your water when you add the dye.  Also, I would wash it in cold water.  Hot or warm water causes most dark and bright colors to bleed.|`|H0e0YAZ5aa	I never have had good luck with RIT on anything, try a tye dye kit at your local craft store|`|kBBBXUfhaa	You should try the powder one.

Good Luck and have fun at the prom!
u53ISZoXaa	is the sheath smaller or bigger than the needle?  Where di you get these from?  From what it sounds like to me, is that you pierce the ear with the needle, insert the jewelery into the sheath and pull them both threw so that the jewelery is in the ear or where ever.  What Gauge these?|`|bAYVSfdJaa	if I'm thinking correctly, the tube comes off & is used to catch the needle.|`|H04xPZViaa	put it through then slide it through the ear all the way with the jewelly right behind if its the oneI'm thinking of the tube should just easily slide of..It's just there so whole you get the jewely the needle doesn't fall out|`|6jcEtPPKaa	I pierced my body so many time myself. lol. Just go to a professional and have them do it before you hit a vane and find yourself in a big mess.|`|JJ16dVgWaa	idk|`|OmlsRcENaa	not sure
6IbjUH01aa	Ah been in your shoes, very damaged hair: Olive Oil is good let it sit in yoru ahir for a while and rinse out b4 you go to bed. Yes you can leave conditinar in your ahir for a while, You can also crack an egg open and leave that on your hair for a while (Vitiman E) Bannana's are good for hair too.|`|AA10097817	Once a week, wash your hair at night and leave your hair wet. Lather your hair in your favorite conditioner or even olive oil (avoid the scalp). Wrap your hair in a towel and go to sleep.<br>  <br>  In the morning, take your shower as usual but wash and rinse twice. Take a very small amount of conditioner and apply to only the ends of your hair. Do not rinse out. Dry your hair as usual.|`|i6tyscumaa	not regular conditioner.. invest in a good quality leave in conditioner - it doesn't have to be expensive, just look for anything that says "mosturising" "replenishing" etc on the bottle.<br>  <br>  apply it all over your damp hair, and put lots on. Then, pop a showercap on and leave it on overnight. Rinse you hair in the morning and you're good to go.<br>  <br>  Don't do this every night as it will damage it further and become greay. Do it about once a week, and i promise you'll start to notice a difference<br>  <br>  Best of Luck! xxx|`|ATYp6h7Oaa	conditioner will work but not as good as this product<br>  <br>  <a href="http://well.ca/products/alberto-v05-moisturizing-hot-oil_5648.html" rel="nofollow">http://well.ca/products/alberto-v05-mois...</a>
oRPvkExwaa	what about hair like chace crawford? i think his hair is versatile. kind of "emo" but not excessively so. also, it looks manageable because it's not too long... google him for more pics to see the cut straight on, but i think this one shows his haircut pretty well.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Chace_Crawford.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a>|`|6kvyXUNWaa	your hair's cute the way it is now (the last pic).<br>  i think you should just get it trimmed and keep it long.<br>  don't get bangs!<br>  :)|`|i6tyscumaa	1.

Here in the UK there's a program called skins, and there's a character called Maxxie, with blonde hair, maybe a bit lighter than yours.<br>  <br>  I think his style would look really good on you, have a look at this picture and see what you think:<br>  <a href="http://www.glogster.com/media/1/2/2/39/2023998.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.glogster.com/media/1/2/2/39/2...</a><br>  <a href="http://img1.liveinternet.ru/images/attach/b/3/27/811/27811758_1214336656_mitch_hewer_1193064907.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img1.liveinternet.ru/images/attac...</a><br>  <br>  seriously - all the girls over here love him!

But if you really wanted to get it cut try going for a layerish look, you can keep it messy, and its easy to maintain, just ask for croppy layers|`|H04xPZViaa	Your hair is the first pic is by the best one..<br>  grow it like that again n just keep it messy<br>  so sexy.|`|bqdRffPLaa	You should cut it all off, you'll look nice!!!

o9cMnbyBaa	Your products probably contain a lot of additives that have built up on your hair.  You really need to use a clarifying shampoo. Pantene and Herbal Essence both make a good one.  Use at least weekly to get rid of that build up.|`|nuc5DBD8aa	If it's greasy before your show, put a little talc in it. It'll take some of the grease out. (Y)|`|6zCm65haaa	first of all DO NOT NEVER USE PANTENE its the worst shampoo ever i'm a hairdresser i no lol make sure u wash ya hair twice but dont scrub cos ya makin ya hair produce more of it's natural oils just massage gently then apply a light conditioner like herbal essences 1 for normal hair or even a cheap 1 but only apply the conditioner mid lenghs and ends NOT on the scald that shud work <br>  <br>  if not and u av changed ya shampoo go back to ya old 1 <br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|whYmf1TAaa	Buy Clarifying shampoo i think its by pantene. I had the same problem and it works really good to get rid of the build up and grease in your hair!<br>  <br>   And it could just be your hormones, atleast thats what my mom told me once but i dont know. And you could put a little baby powder on your roots it soaks up the grease, sounds crazy but it works on some people!|`|ovPfkHSCaa	Looking for the hot short hairstyles for 2009? You don't have look too far. While long hair abounds (and is beautiful), short hair is "in" and the best styles for 2009 are right in front of us!<br>  <br>  More Info Here:-
lK4dOcjJaa	Yeah. And I've been like one of those girls haha. They're really uncomfortable because for one, the waist is really low, second, they're like a second skin fit, and third, the crotch is so tiny. I have to constantly pull mine up and yeh, it's embarrassing.|`|hy94mVD8aa	I have hollister jeans and I really like them. Mine are fitted but I dont tthink theyre too tight. If you hang them to dry instead of putting them into the dryer they dont get as tight/shrink. I do find myself having to pull my jeans up everynow and then it is annoying but i wouldnt call it uncomfortable|`|6jcEtPPKaa	You have a good point there. Some girls like the attention of men undressing the with their eyes. I wear a size 4 and I always buy size 5 because I feel comfortable and also the clothes look good on me when they are not squizing my frickin body.|`|wFMsjZ38aa	yes! i have one pair and theyre okayy but all the other ones i try on dont fit. theyre way too tight. and even when i try on biggger pairs they dont fit right everywhere. and every time someone at my school wears them and they sit down their butt cracks hang out:p haha. its somewhat ammusing|`|CNKBGVgQaa	I love skinny jeans and hollister...but I do find the low-riseness of them a little annoying. I always feel bad when i see girls lean over and their undies are sticking out...lol I do prefer American Eagle over Hollister jeans though...|`|9dd18f9e6c34eb25a0a374720657f305aa	usually if they are adjusting themselves it means the jeans they bought arent the right size. Usually that means they bought a size to small. FYI for you girls buy jeans that fit you not what size you think you are or should be. Also when clothes fit you they look 100x better than when clothes don't fit you. Jeans that are proper size will show off your body and make it look better.|`|6dGt9xlUaa	i wear them and they dont fall down if you wear a belt, thats what those other girls need to try haha :) i think there comfortable|`|45cHcSY4aa	umm.<br>  first of all, girls don't try to show off their bodies by wearing SKINNY jeans. it's not to impress you or any guy.<br>  <br>  and no, i wear hollister jeans i don't find them uncomfortable because i get the right size for me.<br>  and how do you know they're from hollister anyways? do you analyze them and check?<br>  :/<br>  that's odd...|`|IKot6k4Zaa	I have quite a few pairs and I wear a belt with every pair of jeans,and most definitely the Hollister.I think they're rather comfortable,but that's just me.I just don't like to run or like play sports in them because they don't stretch.|`|0ualEDtyaa	Lol!<br>  <br>  I think hollister jeans are really comfortable, I love wearing them, and I dont have to pull them up, cuz I wear the right size for me and I wear them with a belt.|`|GpdYgi4Zaa	I have 2 fave pairs of hollister jeans I wear almost every week. <br>  I bought a size 3 cause the size 2 was too tight. The size 3 I have about less than half an inch space but since I am trying to get pregnant with my husband I feel it works when I gain weight!<br>  but for now I just wear it with a belt and it fits fine! <br>  there a bit long so I fold them up. <br>  <br>  I feel that tight jeans on guys look soooooooo un manly. like those skinny jeans are horrible on men. If your gay go ahead and wear them but they just give men a bad name to wear skinny jeans..lol..im just sayin.
