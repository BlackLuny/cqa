20090222200911AAqaGTL	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Can someone please check my work (pH question)? 10 pts!?	Calculate the pH of a 0.033 M aqueous solution of sodium azide, NaN3. (For hydrazidic acid, Ka= 1.9 x 10-5.)      Here's my work:   (Pretend I have an ICE table)      Ka = (1 x 10^-14)/(1.9 x 10^-5) = 5.26 x 10^-10      5.26 x 10^-10 = x2/0.33      Assuming x is small    = 4.17 x 10^-6      - log (4.17 x 10^-6) = 5.38   14 - 5.38 = 8.62      So my answer is 8.6      Is that the correct answer?

The usual answer seems to be "because it absorbs primarily blue and red light," which is a cop-out non-answer that just raises the question,  "Why then does it absorb blue and red?"

20070307212349AAdApTN	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Algebra.  Variations.  Joint Variation.  y=kxz^2.?	I'm supposed to solve this using variation rules.  In this case, I believe i'm supposed to use, "y varies jointly as x and z" such that y = kxz.      The problem reads:      The collision impact of an automobile varies jointly as it's mass and the square of its speed.  Suppose a 2000-lb car traveling at 55 mph has a collision impact of 6.1.  What is the collision impact of the same car at 65 mph?      I set the problem up like 6.1 = k(2000)55^2, but I end up with an answer that's far from correct.  Am I setting the problem up correctly?  If not, how should it be set up.  If so, how do I go about solving it so that I get the correct answer?

Anything you know will help, thanks!      My mom and I were looking at our salt water fish tank and we noticed lots of pulsating polyps. The grow individually, not in groups or branches and they are about 2-3 inch tall (stalk only) with a flattened anenome-like head. The tendrilles on the heads pulsate in different directions, and on some they don't move hardly at all. Also, we feed the fish shrimp bits and the polyps will "eat" them by letting them float into the middle of the head and then sucking it inside their body. We tried finding a picture, but are having trouble, the closest to what ours actually look like are the Xenia sp, although when we google that, it comes up with a couple a way different pictures. Ideas? Oh, and lastly as far as we are aware, they grew spontaneously.      Picture we found that is similar    http://www.starfish.ch/Fotos/cnidarians-...
